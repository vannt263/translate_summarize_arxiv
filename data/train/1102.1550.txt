    "solid - state based quantum computer ( qc ) architectures have recently attracted considerable interest due to the prospect of possible scalability .",
    "several implementations have been proposed , such as superconducting tunnel junctions  @xcite , nuclear spins in crystal lattices  @xcite , nuclear spins of donors in si  @xcite , and electron spins localized in quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite or at donors  @xcite . however",
    ", a realistic solid - state environment introduces an intrinsic inhomogeneity of the qubit properties due to impurities , defects , interfaces etc .",
    ", resulting in possible computational errors .",
    "nevertheless , fault - tolerant error correction schemes promise to compensate such errors up to a certain level  @xcite , making a quantification of the inhomogeneity a crucial step in the assessment of the suitability of specific physical realizations of qubits for qc .    in the case of qds and donors ,",
    "the zeeman levels of the electron spin in an external magnetic field are used as the qubit states .",
    "the zeeman energy of each electron spin will vary within a spin ensemble , e.g.  due to the random orientation of nuclear spins in the lattice that generate a spatially fluctuating local magnetic field at the position of each electron spin .",
    "the resulting distribution @xmath1 of the larmor frequencies @xmath2 of the electron spins can be quantified in the frequency domain by the inhomogenous linewidth obtained from a traditional continuous wave ( cw ) electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) experiment@xcite .",
    "alternatively , a time domain analysis of @xmath1 can be carried out by measuring the decay of the transverse magnetization in the free induction decay ( fid ) of a conventional pulsed epr experiment .",
    "the problem encountered in both methods is their respective detection limit which is far above the number of spins present in nanoscale structures proposed for qcs .",
    "moreover , fid has not seen a widespread application for studies of paramagnetic species in solids since the broad larmor frequency distribution usually encountered in solid - state spin systems makes the fid signal disappear on a time scale that is usually much shorter than the spectrometer dead time @xmath3 after a microwave pulse of typically @xmath4ns @xcite .",
    "optically and electrically detected magnetic resonance experiments ( odmr and edmr , respectively ) have shown much promise since they exceed conventional epr concerning detection sensitivity by at least six orders of magnitude  @xcite . in the case of phosphorus donors ( @xmath5p ) in silicon , the development of pulsed edmr ( pedmr )  @xcite has paved the way for studying dynamical properties of spin systems by applying different microwave pulse sequences , such as using the hahn - echo sequence to study coherence times @xmath6  @xcite , or the inversion recovery sequence to study spin - lattice relaxation times @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the underlying principle of pedmr on @xmath5p donors is the use of microwave pulses for the generation of coherent states of @xmath5p spins , which can be detected by transient photoconductivity measurements  @xcite , making use of spin - dependent recombination of spin pairs formed by @xmath5p and paramagnetic si / sio@xmath8 interface states  @xcite .    in current pulsed epr",
    ", the dead - time problem of fid has been circumvented by several techniques such as high - frequency epr  @xcite , fid - detected hole burning  @xcite or detection of the epr spectra by the electron spin echo ( ese ) , although the latter is more sensitive to distortions through nuclear modulations in contrast to fid  @xcite . in this paper , we study the possibility of electrically detecting ( ed ) fid using a tomography technique developed earlier @xcite to investigate the larmor frequency distribution @xmath1 of a @xmath5p ensemble in natural silicon ( @xmath9si ) .",
    "it is shown that information within the usual dead time of conventional epr - detected fid can be obtained .",
    "an analytical equation is deduced to describe the experimental data , which in turn agrees well with the results of continuous wave ( cw ) edmr experiments .",
    "furthermore , a numerical study is performed to assess the edfid technique in terms of its capability to quantitatively investigate the coupling of spin pairs .",
