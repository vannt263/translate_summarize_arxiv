    "random - matrix theories are largely and successfully applied in the theoretical description of complex nuclei @xcite , gauge field theories , @xcite mesoscopic systems , @xcite and random surfaces in the field of quantum gravity .",
    "@xcite their advantage is that it is possible to represent the hamiltonian of the corresponding system by a large hermitian matrix acting on a finite - dimensional hilbert space ( if one disregards the continuous part of the spectrum ) .",
    "the random matrices fall into one of three universality classes , named orthogonal ( @xmath5 ) , unitary ( @xmath6 ) , and symplectic ( @xmath13 ) , depending on the global symmetry properties of the hamiltonian they represent .",
    "@xcite the symmetry parameter @xmath14 is the number of independent real components that characterizes a matrix element of the hamiltonian .",
    "a system belongs to the orthogonal class if it has both time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetries , to the unitary class if time - reversal symmetry is broken , and to the symplectic class if the system has time - reversal symmetry but spin - rotation is broken .",
    "the relevant terms in the hamiltonian are a coupling to an applied magnetic field , which breaks time - reversal symmetry , and the spin - orbit interaction , which breaks spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "one of the most relevant applications of the random matrix ensembles is to the study of critical phenomena , particularly to the special case of critical statistics which is found at the anderson metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in disordered systems . at the critical point ,",
    "the states acquire the property of multifractality , which marks a qualitative difference from the extended states in a metal and localized states in an insulator .",
    "these critical states correspond to critical - level statistics .",
    "although several ensembles of nonconventional random matrices have been suggested to describe this statistics @xcite we wish to emphasize the power - law random - banded matrix model ( prbm ) , @xcite for which the multifractality of eigenstates has been rigorously proven .",
    "@xcite this model is characterized by a variance of their off - diagonal matrix elements , which decay as a power law with increasing distance from the diagonal .",
    "it should be mentioned that all these models are of a one - dimensional nature .",
    "energy - level correlations provide general tools for the statistical description of disordered systems , helping in our understanding of the localization transition .",
    "an important statistical measure of spectral correlations is the two - level correlation function ( tlcf ) of the density of states ( dos ) , which measures the correlations of the dos at two different energies .",
    "this function has been derived analytically for the prbm model in the two limiting cases of weak and strong disorder by mapping the corresponding hamiltonian onto an effective @xmath15 model of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) nature @xcite and using renormalization - group methods , @xcite respectively .",
    "we stress that , unlike the 1d prbm model , it has not until now been possible to analytically solve the most interesting , from an experimental point of view , disordered models with long - range transfer terms in @xmath16 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , explicit results for the tlcf in two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) models are still lacking , and finding this function is essential in order to fully understand the mits .",
    "for this reason , we addressed the problem using numerical calculations .",
    "an important and closely related quantity , the level - number variance ( lnv ) , will be also considered .    in this work",
    "we numerically calculate the tlcf and the lnv of critical @xmath1-dimensional random matrix ensembles with long - range off - diagonal elements and orthogonal or unitary symmetry . since mits generically take place at strong disorder ( conventional anderson transition , quantum hall transition , transition in @xmath16 for electrons with strong spin - orbit coupling , etc . )",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the study of both quantities in this regime . in the 1d case our results for the tlcf are in good agreement , except for the numerical coefficient , with existing analytical estimates .",
    "@xcite in addition , we propose expressions for the tlcf in the @xmath16 and @xmath4 cases . apart from the importance of these findings from a general point of view , they may be relevant for several real physical systems ( see sec .",
    "[ mam ] ) .",
    "the paper begins by first describing the model and the methods used for the calculations in sec .",
    "the results for the tlcf and the lnv in models with orthogonal or unitary symmetry are presented in secs .",
    "[ res ] and [ lnv ] , respectively .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sum ] summarizes our findings .",
    "in order to fully represent the mesoscopic systems we introduce an explicit dependence on dimensionality @xmath1 in the widely studied prbm ensemble .",
    "thus , we consider a generalization to @xmath1 dimensions of this ensemble .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , which describes noninteracting electrons on a disordered @xmath1-dimensional square lattice with random long - range hopping , is represented by random hermitian @xmath17 matrices @xmath18 ( real for @xmath5 or complex for @xmath6 ) , whose entries are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean , @xmath19 , and a variance that depends on the distance between the lattice sites @xmath20 @xmath21 in which standard gaussian ensemble normalization is used .",
    "@xcite    using field - theoretical methods , @xcite the prbm model was shown to undergo a sharp transition at @xmath22 from localized states for @xmath23 to delocalized states for @xmath24 .",
    "this transition shows all the key features of the anderson mit , such as multifractality of the eigenfunctions and nontrivial spectral compressibility at criticality . in",
    "what follows , we focus on the critical value @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ h1dor ] ) is an effective bandwidth that serves as a continuous control parameter over a whole line of criticality , i.e , for an exponent equal to @xmath1 in the hopping elements @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it determines the critical dimensionless conductance in the same way as the dimensionality labels the different anderson transitions .",
    "each regime is characterized by its respective coupling strength , which depends on the ratio @xmath27 between diagonal disorder and the off - diagonal transition matrix elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite    many real systems of interest can be described by hamiltonians ( [ h1dor ] ) . among such systems are optical phonons in disordered dielectric materials coupled by electric dipole forces , @xcite excitations in two - level systems in glasses interacting via elastic strain , @xcite magnetic impurities in metals coupled by an @xmath28 ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yodida interaction , @xcite and impurity quasiparticle states in two - dimensional disordered @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "@xcite it also describes a particle moving fast through a lattice of coulomb scatterers with power - law singularity , @xcite the dynamics of two interacting particles in a 1d random potential , @xcite and a quantum chaotic billiard with a nonanalytic boundary .",
    "@xcite    the tlcf is defined in the usual way @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fluctuating dos and @xmath31 denotes averaging over disorder realizations . at the critical point",
    "@xmath32 acquires a scale - invariant form , if considered as a function of @xmath33 , the frequency normalized to the mean level spacing @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite in the case of constant average dos , @xmath35 can be simply rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distribution of distances @xmath38 between @xmath39 other energy levels and the @xmath40 function describes the self - correlation of the levels .",
    "@xcite    the strong disorder limit ( @xmath41 ) of the 1d prbm model can be studied using the renormalization - group method of refs .   and .",
    "for orthogonal symmetry , the following result is obtained for the tlcf at the center of the spectral band : @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the complementary error function and @xmath44 , whereas for unitary symmetry @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "note that for small @xmath47 , @xmath48 behave as @xmath49 thus reflecting the levels repulsion effect , whereas they tend asymptotically to @xmath50 at large values of @xmath47 .",
    "another important quantity , which characterizes fluctuations in the level density on larger scales than the mean spacing , is the variance @xmath51 of the number of levels in an energy window that contains @xmath52 on average .",
    "this variance is given in terms of the tlcf by @xmath53 .",
    "the number variance ( [ s2n ] ) is a statistical quantity that provides a quantitative measure of the long - range rigidity of the energy spectrum . for the poisson distribution ,",
    "the levels are uncorrelated and there are large level - number fluctuations , leading to a linear variance @xmath54 . on the other hand",
    ", the level correlations in the wigner - dyson statistics make the spectrum more rigid and the number variance grows only logarithmically @xmath55 . however , in the critical regime , the variance has been conjectured to be poisson - like @xcite @xmath56 where the level compressibility @xmath57 is another important parameter for characterizing the mit and which takes values @xmath58 , with zero referring to delocalized states and unity the localized states .    for the computation of @xmath0 and @xmath59",
