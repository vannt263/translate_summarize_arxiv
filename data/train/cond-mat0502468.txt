    "the aim of theoretical quantum computation is to understand how the peculiar properties of quantum states can be exploited in order to encode and manipulate information in a way which is quantitatively superior to classical computers @xcite .",
    "the elementary unit of quantum information , the so - called _ qubit _ , is in general assumed to be a normalized vector in a hilbert space @xmath1 spanned by two orthogonal eigenstates , conventionally labeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and it is then completely determined by giving two real numbers ( a component and a relative phase ) . in principle , a quantum computation can be seen as a sequence of appropriate unitary transformations operating on sets of qubits , which requires having the quantum state of the system under control for a sufficiently long time .    a completely different point of view is shared by a group of quantum computation paradigms that could be collectively referred to as quantum ground state search techniques : two examples are given by the quantum adiabatic evolution technique and its variants @xcite and by the semi - classical simulated quantum annealing algorithms @xcite .",
    "the basic idea common to all these approaches is to simulate the externally driven evolution of an artificial quantum system , whose ground states encode in some way the solutions of specific computational problems .",
    "the underlying hypothesis is that a quantum system can dynamically explore the state space more efficiently than its classical counterpart .",
    "the positive role played by quantum fluctuations has been verified in a number of different cases , both in real experiments @xcite and in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the path - integral monte carlo quantum annealing ( pimc - qa ) algorithm has been applied with success , for instance , to the optimization of instances of the ising spin glass @xcite and of the traveling salesman problem @xcite . here",
    "the quantum algorithm outperformed classical simulated annealing @xcite and the convergence time was significantly shorter , even after taking in account the extra cost of simulating a quantum computation on a classical computer @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , very few results of universal validity are known to date , and theoretical indications are poor and sometimes contradictory @xcite . in particular , it has not been proved that a good quantum optimization pathway must always exist in general . in the cases in which a quantum procedure proved to be more efficient than the best classical one",
    ", the superior quantum performance can not be explained quantitatively .    in this paper , we will present a careful analysis of the pimc - qa applied to a hard instance of the random max-3-sat problem @xcite",
    ". the main emphasis will not be on performance , but rather on understanding the properties that make simulated quantum annealing so different from its classical counterpart .",
    "because we are here mainly interested in the comparison between algorithmic aspects , potentially relevant physical issues as the study of aging and memory / rejuvenation phenomena @xcite will not be addressed directly .",
    "the hardness of the chosen 3-sat instance deserves some comments .",
    "it is common , in the quantum computation literature , to analyze the performance of newly introduced algorithms by testing them on simplified toy - problems of reduced size ; this is essentially due to the demanding memory and time required by the classical simulation of a quantum computer .",
    "we decided instead to attempt the optimization of a true `` competition problem '' , of a kind known to threaten seriously even the best heuristics known for the 3-sat problem , namely walksat @xcite . here",
    "smaller size problems might indeed still be difficult , but the dynamics would be dominated by large finite - size - fluctuation effects @xcite and misleading indications could be obtained about the general properties of the quantum optimization of a glassy energy landscape , which becomes really `` hard '' only in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "for a hard 3-sat problem , one may wonder now if the quantum system is actually able to tunnel across the extensive walls encircling the deep and scattered ground state valleys . here",
    "we expect that both classical and quantum annealing will be trapped by local minima lying well above the glassy threshold levels @xcite , preventing to access the very low - energy region where clustering of states takes place .",
    "the comparison between the simulated classical and quantum relaxations will nevertheless show that the two algorithms explore sectors of the phase space characterized by different geometrical properties .",
    "as we shall see , the quantum pathways tend to visit basins of attraction with a considerably larger number of flat directions and this feature will turn out to be highly counterproductive for an efficient optimization in the specific case of the 3-sat landscape .",
    "the poor performance of quantum search techniques applied to the 3-sat problem , envisaged already in ref .",
    "@xcite , will then find here a striking confirmation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ 3sat : sec ] and [ pimc : sec ] will give respectively a brief description of the combinatorial optimization problem under study and of the employed algorithms .",
    "[ num_exp : sec ] a first set of numerical experiments will be presented , while the analogy between pimc - qa and genetic - like algorithms will be pointed out in sec .",

    "[ autocorr : sec ] the differences between quantum and classical monte carlo dynamics will be highlighted by means of an autocorrelation analysis , and of a characterization of the landscape geometry . in sec .",
    "[ field_cycling : sec ] a more sophisticated cooling schedule will be introduced , allowing the quantum algorithm to outperform classical simulated annealing , at least over short simulation times . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions : sec ] , finally , concluding comments about open problems and possible future lines of development will be presented .",
    "under many aspects , the 3-sat problem can be considered as the prototype of most of the hard combinatorial optimization problems : 3-sat was indeed the first problem for which a direct proof of * np*-completeness was ever obtained . since then , the easiest way of proving the * np*-completeness of some new problem has been to show its equivalence with some 3-sat instance @xcite . furthermore , 3-sat is also of considerable practical relevance in many engineering applications , notably in the field of artificial intelligence and automated planning @xcite .    in order to state the problem , consider a set of @xmath5 boolean variables @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( true or false ) . denoting by @xmath8 the variable @xmath9 or its negation @xmath10 ,",
    "one then considers the disjunction ( logical or ) of 3 variables @xmath11 , which is called a @xmath4-_clause_. the random 3-sat problem consists in deciding if the conjunction ( logical and ) of @xmath12 different clauses @xmath13  each clause being formed by 3 variables extracted at random among the @xmath5 available , and appearing negated or directed with uniform probability  can be simultaneously satisfied by a truth value assignment @xmath14 .",
    "the optimization version of 3-sat ( the so called max-3-sat problem ) is obtained if one is interested only in finding a truth value assignment which minimizes the number of violated clauses .",
    "if we associate an ising spin variable @xmath15 to each boolean variable @xmath9 , we can assign to any clause @xmath16 involving three variables @xmath17 an energy @xmath18 given by @xmath19 where the coupling @xmath20 assumes the value -1 if the variable @xmath9 appears negated in clause @xmath21 , + 1 otherwise .",
    "evidently @xmath22 if the corresponding clause is satisfied , @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "therefore , each given realization of the @xmath12 random clauses is associated to the hamiltonian of a spin system with quenched disorder : @xmath24 which simply counts the number of violated clauses .",
    "notice that the same variable appears typically in more than one clause , sometimes negated , sometimes not , giving thus origin potentially to frustration .",
    "statistical mechanics techniques can be used to determine the _ phase diagram _ of the random 3-sat problem @xcite .",
    "the main parameter in this phase diagram ( determining the hardness of a formula ) is the ratio @xmath25 between the number , @xmath12 , of clauses and the number , @xmath5 , of variables .",
    "the probability that a satisfying assignment exists becomes one in the thermodynamical limit for @xmath26 , but vanishes for larger @xmath27 s .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath28 , the ground - state configurations group in many clusters well separated among each other ( one - step replica symmetry breaking @xcite ) , hidden to any local search heuristic by an exponentially larger number of metastable states ( _ threshold states _ ) . a lower bound to the energy of the threshold states acting as entropic traps is provided by the so - called gardner energy @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments @xcite are in agreement with the analytical predictions @xcite , and confirm that instances of random 3-sat sampled in the vicinity of the sat / unsat boundary @xmath29 are typically hard .",
    "the trapping effect induced by the threshold states can not be neglected when the instance - size is large ( @xmath30 ) and large statistical fluctuations become sufficiently rare @xcite .",
    "smaller random formulas are , on the other hand , often easily solvable by classical simulated annealing .",
    "as already pointed out in the introduction , the efficiency of any new heuristics can then be significantly tested only over 3-sat samples of a rather large size , which is considerably demanding for long quantum simulation times .",
    "let us consider the classical spin model described by the hamiltonian ( [ sat_ham ] ) . in the well known classical simulated annealing scheme @xcite , the configuration of the system is randomly initialized at an initial temperature @xmath31 and it is then updated",
    "according to , for instance , a standard metropolis monte carlo rule : @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the probability of accepting a given spin flip at time @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the energy change induced by the flip and @xmath36 is the temperature at time @xmath34 .",
    "the temperature is gradually reduced according to a specific schedule that can be rather influent on the performance of the algorithm ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we shall concentrate our attention on simple linear schedules , where the temperature is reduced by a fixed amount @xmath37 every @xmath38 monte carlo complete sweeps of the systems ( we chose @xmath39 in our experiments , while @xmath37 was completely determined by the initial value @xmath31 and by the maximum number of iterations ) .",
    "this is not in general the best performing choice , but its simplicity makes the comparison with quantum annealing very transparent .",
    "the classical hamiltonian @xmath40 , in analogy with the ising glass case @xcite , can be turned into a quantum hamiltonian , by substituting each classical ising spin @xmath41 with the third component of a pauli su(2 ) spin operator @xmath42 , and by introducing a perturbing transverse field @xmath43 : @xmath44 the @xmath43-dependent term plays the role of `` kinetic energy '' , inducing quantum fluctuations in the spin orientation .",
    "the basic idea of quantum annealing is to drive the system ( [ quantum_ham ] ) toward its ground state by adiabatically varying the intensity of the perturbation field between two extremal values @xmath45 and @xmath46 ,  instead of gradually reducing the temperature , like in the case of thermal simulated annealing .    in the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) scheme , the statistical - mechanical behavior of the quantum spin model ( [ quantum_ham ] )",
    "is approximately turned into a classical simulation problem by resorting to the suzuki - trotter transformation @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following classical model with @xmath47 degrees of freedom : @xmath48 the system ( [ suzuki_ham ] ) can actually be seen as composed of @xmath49 replicas ( trotter replicas ) @xmath50 of the original classical configuration @xmath51 at an effective quantum temperature @xmath52 , coupled among them by a nearest - neighbor transverse ferromagnetic coupling @xmath53 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions must be imposed along the transverse ( trotter ) direction .",
    "the intensity of @xmath53 is related to the strength of the quantum perturbation term and to the temperature @xmath54 by the following relation : @xmath55 when @xmath49 goes to infinity , the partition functions of the hamiltonians ( [ quantum_ham ] ) and ( [ suzuki_ham ] ) become identical , and the statistical - mechanical properties of the two systems become perfectly equivalent .",
    "one can then hope to simulate the relaxation dynamics of ( [ quantum_ham ] ) by applying a classical metropolis algorithm to a suzuki - trotter transformed hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ suzuki_ham ] @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the quantum simulation will increase for larger values of @xmath49 , but the memory and time requirements will also increase accordingly .    in the simplest possible monte carlo implementation ,",
    "one tries to flip independently each of the @xmath47 spins of the equivalent classical system , but it is common @xcite to perform in addition also _ global moves _ in which the spins @xmath56 corresponding to a given site @xmath57 are simultaneously flipped in all the trotter replicas ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this type of move does not affect the quantum kinetic energy contribution , but just the average classical energy . in a sense",
    ", the introduction of global moves allows to simulate a constant - temperature classical relaxation of the average classical energy , superimposed on the local modifications induced by quantum fluctuations at finite temperature .    a schedule for the quantum algorithm",
    "must also be chosen .",
    "the principal drawback of the pimc approach is the impossibility of simulating the quantum system directly at zero temperature . for this purpose",
    ", other quantum monte carlo schemes should be used , like the green function monte carlo method @xcite . the simplest possibility for",
    "a pimc quantum annealing schedule is , once again , to linearly adjust the intensity of the transverse field between two given extremes @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while keeping the temperature @xmath59 fixed at a constant value .",
    "more elaborated cooling protocols could be devised , but the linear strategy has been applied with success for the optimization of the ising spin glass @xcite and of the traveling salesman problem @xcite . even for this very basic schedule , four parameters , ( @xmath60 ) , need to be tuned carefully in order to achieve a good performance .",
    "a more complex field - cycling schedule will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ field_cycling : sec ] .",
    "let us describe now a first set of numerical experiments , performed over a single 3-sat random instance with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , ( _ i.e. _ , right at the border of the sat / unsat transition ) , for several choices of annealing iterations and of trotter replicas .",
    "the differences among random samples extracted from the same ensemble become negligible for such large sizes , and we can then carry out significant experiments without averaging over a large set of instances .    using an efficient _ ad - hoc _ algorithm ( the walksat heuristic supplemented by a message - passing procedure @xcite ) , we verified that the chosen formula ( at @xmath62 ) was actually satisfiable , as expected from theory for @xmath63 .",
    "an empirical parameter tuning was then performed for the initial temperature @xmath31 . in the case of linear - schedule classical annealing",
    "( ca ) , and fixing the maximum number of iterations , we conducted several experiments with different @xmath31 . for @xmath31",
    "smaller than the optimal value @xmath64 the strength of the thermal fluctuations induced in the system was too small , and the dynamics was trapped prematurely at an early stage . on the other hand , for initial values larger than the optimal value , too much time was wasted randomly wandering around the landscape at excessively high temperatures .",
    "a similar multi - parameter optimization was performed in the case of linear - schedule quantum annealing ( qa ) .",
    "the best results were obtained by taking @xmath65 and @xmath66 , independently from the choice of the number of replicas @xmath49 .",
    "the optimal value of the effective quantum temperature @xmath52 turned out to be 0.3 , coincident with the optimal @xmath31 for ca , a value evidently more related to the statistics of the energy barriers of the formula landscape , than to the details of the relaxation pathway under consideration .",
    "a comparison between the performance of the optimal ca and the optimal qa at @xmath67 , both with and without global moves , is shown in fig .",
    "[ ca_vs_qa_fig ] .",
    "the graph shows the average residual energy ( difference between the final energy reached by the algorithm and the konwn ground - state energy ) as a function of the maximum number of total annealing iterations , ranging over several decades ( from @xmath68 to almost @xmath69 ) . in each point , an average has been taken over 50 different realizations of the same experiment ; in the case of qa , a second average was performed among the energies of the @xmath49 replicas , which are in general different .",
    "it can be seen that the linear - schedule ca always performs better than the linear - schedule qa , despite the improvement produced in the latter by the use of a large number of replicas ( convergence is essentially reached for @xmath70 , see inset of fig .",
    "[ ca_vs_qa_fig ] , but we chose @xmath67 to extend as much as possible the simulation time ) .",
    "the asymptotic slope of the linear - schedule qa curves seems indeed to be definitely less steep than that of ca , independently of the number of replicas involved in the simulation and of the use of global moves .",
    "this behavior is strikingly worse than that observed in both the ising spin glass and the tsp cases @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the influence of landscape geometry might be helpful in order to achieve a better understanding of this different performance success .",
    "it should be remarked that large differences exist between the organization of the optimal states in the combinatorial problems analyzed so far .",
    "for instance , it is generally believed that the ground state properties of the tsp @xcite are well described by a replica - symmetric ansatz ( all the ground state assignments are in a single broad valley ) , while replica - symmetry - breaking ( _ i.e. _ , clustering of ground states ) is needed to achieve a good characterization of the 3-sat zero - temperature properties @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the states visited by both ca and qa lie well above the glassy threshold ( gardner energy ) for the 3-sat instance , and very few details are known about the nature of such highly excited states .",

    "some spin flips that would have been unlikely in absence of the replica - interaction term can now be accepted , thanks to the kinetic term , and several replicas can enter in configurations generally not visited by typical ca trajectories .",

    "the quantum system is visiting configurations with a significantly larger fraction of downhill and flat directions .",
    "if an abuse of language is tolerated , one could say that the ca follows narrow canyons , where the number of directions bringing to a decrease in energy is limited , while the qa prefers to explore the edges of mid - altitude plateaus .",
    "this phenomenon , which seems to be a genuinely quantum feature captured by the pimc simulation , is strongly reminiscent of what happens in continuous space , where the choice of broader potential wells allow the system to reduce the kinetic contribution to the total energy ( curvature - induced effects are also well known in the theory of instanton tunneling @xcite ) .",
    "quite interestingly , the typical number of spins which are different among the various trotter replicas is of the order of the number of flat directions .",
    "this means that all the configurations simultaneously taken by the quantum system belong to a single broad landscape valley , which is explored in all its wideness by the quantum system .",
    "when the transverse field intensity is vanishing , the target selection transition toward a classical regime takes place , and the number of uphill directions increases abruptly , indicating that the dynamical collapse is paralleled by a change in the local landscape topology . the poor performance of qa in the present 3-sat case could be then explained by the existence of broad basins of attraction strewn with deceptive and highly attractive sinks , that , unlike the cleavages preferred from the very beginning by the ca , prevent access to lower energy sectors . to conclude , we remark that genetic - like search is also known to be strongly perturbed by the presence of multiple and scattered wells @xcite .",

    "[ field_cycling_fig ] ) .",
    "lower - lying target states are then selected after each descending ramp . over short time",
    "scales ( number of mc iterations approximately smaller than 200000 , when taking @xmath67 ) , such a hybrid field - cycling strategy performs definitely better than a purely classical one .",
    "the same experiment has been repeated in absence of the transverse magnetic field , and with the same number of ( now completely decoupled ) trotter replicas .",
    "the average over the runs and over the trotter replicas @xmath93 , and the average over the runs of the best replica energy @xmath94 have been computed .",
    "it is possible to see from fig .",
    "[ field_cycling_fig ] that @xmath95 obtained with the hybrid strategy lies clearly below @xmath94 , indicating that quantum effects give access to states that can hardly be reached in the same time even by rare large classical fluctuations .",
    "quantum restarts are then more effective than classical restarts @xcite , at least when short schedules are taken in account .",
    "the analysis of purely classical cycling experiments confirms the importance of quantum fluctuations . the fact that @xmath96 shows already that the superior performance is not simply due to the gradual reduction of the initial temperature among the different ramps .",
    "furthermore , the concatenation of short classical annealings , each new one starting from a lower @xmath31 and going down to @xmath97 , provide a worse final energy than a single classical annealing of the same length .",
    "indeed , even if the @xmath57-th descending classical annealing ramp ( starting from @xmath98 ) produces a configuration with an energy lower than in the random case , the @xmath57-th fast ascending ramp to the temperature @xmath99 of the @xmath100-th descending ramp completely erase now any positive effect .",
    "the system is indeed pushed at the energy level typical of a fast quenching at the temperature @xmath101 and , unlike the quantum case , the memory of the previously visited low - energy configurations is completely lost .",
    "the presence of the kinetic energy term is therefore crucial for the survival of `` seed patterns '' , peculiar of the target configurations obtained at the end of the @xmath57-th descending ramp , from which new and better low - lying configurations can be grown during the following @xmath100-th stage . in the genetic algorithm jargon",
    ", one could say that the ascending ramps renew the available gene pool without destroying completely the highly fit genes of the preceding - step generation .",
    "the situation is however different for larger time scales ( mc iterations larger than 200000 for @xmath67 ) .",
    "longer field - cycling schedules are obtained by simply rescaling with a constant factor the duration of all the ramps in a shorter schedule .",
    "the asymptotic slope of the field - cycling cooling curve in fig .",
    "[ ca_vs_qa_fig ] becomes remarkably similar to the other qa cases .",
    "a local topology analysis analogous to the one of the previous section shows indeed that the valleys explored by the field - cycling strategy are flat and open as the ones found in the simpler linear qa case . if the reduction of temperature allows the system to explore the landscape at different length scales @xcite and to find then better target configurations , the attractive power of the visited high - lying local minima continues to be very strong , and lower energy regions remain fundamentally inaccessible .",
    "we have conducted a detailed comparison of the performance of path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) quantum annealing ( qa ) strategies , against a standard thermal simulated annealing ( ca ) , on a very hard instance of a classical np - complete problem , 3-sat .",
    "contrary to the successes previously obtained by the same technique on ising spin glasses @xcite and on an instance of the traveling salesman problem @xcite , qa performs here definitely _",
    "worse _ than ca : the ultimate large simulation time behavior of qa shows a poorer slope against inverse annealing rate than ca ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the course of this instructive negative example of qa performance ( perhaps even more instructive because it is negative ) , we gained some experience and insight on the peculiar dynamical relaxation process behind the pimc - qa algorithm .",
    "in particular , we saw , from overlap autocorrelation analysis , that the quantum algorithm leads to `` selection '' , in the course of annealing , of a target configuration over which all the different replicas eventually collapse , as the transverse coupling @xmath53 induced by the quantum term @xmath102 grows to infinity . as a byproduct",
    ", we also realized that restarting repeatedly quantum fluctuations using such target configurations as intermediate steps leads to a hybrid strategy that definitely improves over the bare linear schedule qa , with results comparable to ca for short simulation times .",
    "nevertheless , even with these considerable improvements of qa , the slope of the annealing curve seems to be essentially unaffected by refinements , and definitely worse than that of ca .",
    "this apparent `` intrinsic '' nature of the worse performance of pimc - qa over ca suggests that the 3-sat landscape ( at least , when single spin - flip moves are considered ) is in some way more difficult for the quantum algorithm than for the classical one , presumably due to the fact that the flat and open landscape sectors that are peculiarly selected by the quantum relaxation bring in the 3-sat case toward `` dead ends '' , hiding dangerous sink traps .",
    "finally , we should stress that both pimc - qa and ca are definitely worse than ad - hoc local search algorithms , notably walksat @xcite .",
    "one probably important feature that is missing to both ca and pimc - qa , but known to be important in walksat and similar local heuristics , is the so - called _",
    "focusing_. that is the fact that the proposed random flips should be restricted to spins that are exclusively involved in currently unsat clauses ( according to the rule of thumb `` if it is not broken , do nt fix it '' ) . on the contrary , standard metropolis sampling , as implemented in both pimc - qa and ca , does not discriminate among the candidate spin flips , and only considers the corresponding energy change @xmath35 ( see eq .",
    "[ acceptance ] ) .",
    "this suggests that a possible better way of implementing qa is through a green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) algorithm , whereby a suitable kinetic term and appropriate guiding functions , via importance sampling , can in principle take care of some form of focusing .",
    "another important advantage of gfmc over pimc would be the fact that annealing could be performed strictly at @xmath103 , whereas the unavoidably finite temperature @xmath59 has clearly an influence on the pimc - qa dynamics ( see fig .",
    "[ field_cycling_fig ] ) .    in conclusion , while showing that statements such as `` quantum is better '' have not necessarily anything to do with physical reality  at least for arbitrary choices of the problem landscape and of the associated elementary moves ",
    ", our work still leaves many important questions open .",
    "one should strive for a reliable _ predictive _ theory that , taking as inputs the appropriate features of the complex energy landscape for the problem at hand , or for a class of problems , would be able to anticipate if , how , and where `` quantum is better '' .",
    "closely connected with this is the ability in designing quantum kinetic hamiltonian terms that implement _ ad hoc _ local moves particularly efficient in exploring a given geometry .",
