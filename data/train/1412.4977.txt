    "its good understanding is crucial for the proper modeling of the final state of minimum - bias events , and can help improve the simulation of e.g. the underlying event , pile - up events , and the measurement of the machine luminosity at the lhc . in this paper , we present the recent cms results on diffraction , forward physics and soft qcd , and discuss their comparison to predictions of various theoretical models .    , and diffractive processes with ( b ) single dissociation , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , ( c ) double - dissociation , @xmath5 , and ( d ) central dissociation , @xmath6 . the x(y ) represents a dissociated - proton or a centrally - produced hadronic system.,width=272 ]",
    "diffractive interactions are characterized by the presence of at least one non - exponentially suppressed large rapidity gap ( lrg ) in the final state .",
    "lrg is defined as a region in pseudorapidity devoid of particles is presumed to be formed by a color - singlet exchange with vacuum quantum numbers , referred to as pomeron ( i@xmath7p ) exchange .",
    "inclusive ( soft ) diffractive interactions ( with no hard scale ) can not be calculated within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , and traditionally have been described by models based on regge theory .",
    "model predictions generally differ when extrapolated from pre - lhc energies ( e.g. 1.96 tev ) to 7 tev at lhc .",
    "thus experimental results at lhc provide important input for tuning various models and current event generators .",

    "the sd and dd events were separated using the castor calorimeter , which covers the very forward region of the experiment , @xmath11 .",
    "minimum bias events were selected by requiring a signal above noise level in any of the bsc ( beam scintillator counter ) devices ( @xmath12 ) and the presence of at least two energy deposits in the central cms detector ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "diffractive events were selected by requiring the presence of a forward rapidity gap reconstructed at the edge of the central detector or central gap .",

    "this is the first result of the combined cms and totem analysis , covering the ranges of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "depending on the configuration of the t2 detectors with a signal , events were categorized into three different samples : ( i ) an inclusive sample , sensitive to @xmath36 of the total inelastic proton - proton cross section , ( ii ) a sample enhanced in non - single diffractive ( nsd - enhanced ) events , and ( iii ) a sample enhanced in single - diffractive ( sd - enhanced ) events .",

    "in a proton - proton scattering the hadronic final state can be described as the superposition of different contributions .",
