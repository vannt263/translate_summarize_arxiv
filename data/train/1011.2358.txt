    "a keystone procedure to obtain macroscopic thermodynamics quantities ( e.g. , energy , specific heat , magnetization , phase transition points , etc ) of statistical systems is to perform appropriate averages over their microscopic configurations . in practice , however , such systems usually have a prohibitive number of states for a full covering .",
    "therefore , approaches relying on proper representative samplings must be considered and so monte carlo tools become fundamental for calculations . by a proper sampling",
    "we mean that for a given instance a method should satisfactorily : ( i ) represent the way the system actually evolves throughout the different microstates ( among the whole set @xmath0 of microstates in the system ) ; and ( ii ) generate a set @xmath1 of visited microstates that indeed gives a good picture of all the relevant microstates which describe the problem at that particular situation .    within this framework ,",
    "an important issue is to know under what conditions the above criteria are fullfiled .",
    "for example , biased values for physical quantities may arise when the system displays local free - energy minima and the dynamics used to generate the microscopic configurations either is not able to cross such barriers or it does so , but only after too long times .",
    "consequently , we have broken ergodicity for finite ( even large ) simulations @xcite , leading to metastability and thus to poor estimates for the system properties due to a non - representative @xmath1 .",
    "metastability and broken ergodicity appear in several problems like ; spin - glasses ; protein folding , biomolecules ; and random search , to name just a few @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are not restricted only to complex systems , also being present in simpler contexts like in lattice - gas models displaying first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "as noted , in such case the sampling dynamics may present difficulties to cross the energetic barriers . then",
    ", the system can develop hysteresis by passing back and forth the phase frontiers as we change the parameter control @xcite .",
    "different alternative ideas have been considered to overcome @xcite or even circumvent @xcite entropic barriers , thus restoring the ergodic behavior . in particular ,",
    "enhanced sampling algorithms , such as parallel tempering ( pt ) @xcite  also known as multiple replica exchange  and simulated tempering ( st ) @xcite , have recently attracted a lot of attention , specially due to their simplicity and generality compared to other monte carlo algorithms @xcite .",
    "briefly , in the pt method , microscopic configurations in higher temperatures are used to assure an ergodic free walk in lower temperatures : one simulates replicas of the same system at distinct @xmath2 s , allowing the exchange of temperature between the replicas . for the st , on the other hand , an unique replica is considered , however , the system occasionally undergoes temperature changes along its evolution .",
    "given the different tempering implementation in the two approaches , a natural question is how they compare to each other @xcite .",
    "for example , the rate of temperatures switching is higher for the st @xcite .",
    "so , usually one could expect a larger number of distinct phase space regions visited when using the st , thus a possible advantage over the pt .",
    "but as we discuss in section ii.c , near phase transition conditions this is not always the case .",
    "therefore , it still an open query if indeed one method is systematically superior in all situations . with the above in mind , here we compare the pt and st efficiencies when applied to phase transitions , specially to the first order case .",
    "a short comment regarding the comparison between the pt and st for first order phase transitions is in order . in principle , for a true first order transition , i.e. , for systems in the thermodynamic limit , the energy descontinuous gap would lead to a small probability of accepting exchanges between the pt replicas @xcite .",
    "but in concrete calculations , one is always dealing with finite sizes @xmath3 , where the actual thermodynamics properties are described by continuous functions .",
    "also , these functions are smooth and tend to the correct asymptotic behavior ( for @xmath4 ) only if the state space is properly sampled @xcite , what has been shown to be the case for the pt @xcite .",
    "thus , in practice the above mentioned difficulty for the pt is not an issue and the method is indeed an appropriate tool to study first order transitions , as discussed and exemplified in different works @xcite . hence , the pt and st ( this latter rarely considered in such regime , few exceptions being refs .",
    "@xcite ) can be analyzed at the same footing .",
    "so , possible convergence differences can be associated just to the way the algorithms generate the sets @xmath1 , and not to the approaches eventual instrinsic distinctions ( recall that conceptually they are similar @xcite ) .    in this contribution",
    "we first revisit the simplest ising spin model displaying a well understood second order phase transition .",
    "this is an instructive example because in a recent work @xcite , it has been shown that through an improved version of the st , the frequency of successful exchanges ( measured in terms of transition decay rates ) is higher for the st than for the pt method .",
    "however , the comparison was not carried near the critical temperature . by analyzing time correlation functions , defined as @xmath5 for @xmath6 relevant thermodynamic quantities ( like energy and magnetization ) of mean @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting time averages ,",
    "one no longer gets a better performance of the st around @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , we find that the pt leads to faster decaying @xmath10 s .    then , we move to the main focus of this contribution : the harder situation of strong first - order phase transitions , where the use of one - flip algorithms like metropolis often gives rise to poor numerical simulations .",
    "as the specific case study , we consider the lattice gas model with vacancies ( a spin-1 model in the magnetic systems jargon ) @xcite .",
    "this class of problems has been extensively studied under different alternative methods @xcite .",
    "hence , the many available results can help to benchmark those obtained from the pt and st .",
    "we show that although both , pt and st , lead to equivalent good results in the limit of long simulations , the pt displays a faster convergence towards stationarity .",
    "moreover , for the pt , the tunneling between different phases at the coexistence is more frequent and the generated microscopic configurations uncorrelate faster .",
    "the work is organized as the following . in sec .",
    "ii we review the pt and st methods , discussing distinct implementations .",
    "we also give reasons why the pt may outperform st near phase transition conditions . in sec .",
    "iii we consider a spin system displaying a second - order phase transition . the lattice - gas model and its comparative study with the pt and st methods ",
    "addressing a first order phase transition  are presented in sec .",
    "iv . finally , in sec . v we draw our last remarks and the conclusion .",
    "the central idea behind a tempering enhanced sampling algorithm is try to guarantee ergodicity by means of appropriate temperature changes during the simulations , thus allowing efficient and uniform visits to a fragmented multiple regions phase space @xcite .",
    "suppose we shall study a system at a given @xmath11 .",
    "we assume @xmath12 and define a set of @xmath13 distinct temperatures @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "there are different ways to implement tempering @xcite , two important ones being the pt and st , which we describe next .",
    "the pt approach combines a standard algorithm ( e.g. , metropolis ) with the simultaneous evolution of @xmath13 copies of the system ( each at a different @xmath16 ) , occasionally allowing the replicas to exchange their temperatures .",
    "fixing relevant parameters , the method is implemented by first running @xmath17 times ( to assure equilibration of all the @xmath13 copies ) a two parts procedure , ( a ) and ( b ) , discussed below .",
    "after that , for each ( a)-(b ) composite mc step ( repeated @xmath18 times ) we calculate the thermodynamics quantities at the temperature of interest @xmath19 .",
    "the average over the @xmath18 partial values give the final results .",
    "in fact , we further improve the calculations and estimate the statistical deviations by performing this procedure ( after relaxation ) @xmath20 times , so that in total the number of ( a)-(b ) mc steps is @xmath21 .    in ( a )",
    ", for each replica ( at a distinct @xmath16 ) , a site lattice @xmath22 is chosen randomly .",
    "then , its occupation variable @xmath23 may change to a new value @xmath24 according to the metropolis prescription @xmath25\\}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath26 is the energy variation due to the occupation change .",
    "this is done until a full lattice covering and the process is repeated all over again @xmath27 times .",
    "( b ) in the second part , arbitrary pairs of replicas ( say , at @xmath28 and @xmath29 and with microscopy configurations @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) can undergo temperatures switchings , with probability ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 \\}. \\label{p - pt}\\ ] ] the pt algorithm is schematic represented in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) .",
    "although the above prescription is rather simple , few technical aspects should be observed .",
    "first , it is necessary to find a good compromise between the @xmath34 s values ( which increase with @xmath35 decreasing ) and the replicas number @xmath13 .",
    "this is so to guarantee relatively frequent exchanges , while keeping the computational efforts low .",
    "hence , extra procedures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "here we use only the ones explained above .",
    "however we mention that for our present systems , one of us has tested some of these extra implementations @xcite ( always assuming arbitrary @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s for the step ( b ) above ) , not finding any significant difference .",
    "second , the system size ( @xmath3 ) also imposes restrictions on the @xmath13 s . for small systems ,",
    "a few number of replicas is enough to assure rapid convergence . on the other hand , by increasing @xmath3 the exchange probabilities ( eq . ( [ p - pt ] ) )",
    "decreases , so the inclusion of extra copies becomes necessary .",
    "such care has been explicit taken in our simulations .",
    "finally , we observe that most works that use the pt method implement the switching attempts only between adjacent replicas ( i.e. , at @xmath28 and @xmath38 ) , in principle because the probability of exchanges decreases for increasing @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite that non - adjacent exchanges are essential to speed up the crossing of high free - energy barriers ( what we discuss in more details in section ii.c ) .",
    "therefore , here we will allow exchanges between first ( @xmath40 ) , second ( @xmath41 ) , etc , neighbor replicas , meaning those between @xmath16 and @xmath42 .     and",
    "@xmath43 ) and one temperature change for the st ( @xmath44 ) . ]      for the st , a single realization of the model is considered , however , during the dynamics its temperature can assume the different values @xmath16 s .",
    "the implementation is similar to that for the pt in section ii.a , but applied only to one copy of the system .",
    "therefore , the previous step ( b ) now reads : a change @xmath45 may take place for the system according to the probability ( with @xmath46 its configuration ) @xmath47 \\}.\\ ] ] the st algorithm is illustrated in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "note that @xmath48 depends on the weights @xmath49 s .",
    "moreover , for a better sampling , the evolution should uniformly visit all the established temperatures .",
    "this is just the case when @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the system free energy at @xmath16 @xcite . to obtain @xmath52 is not an easy task .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite its exact ( numerical ) values follows from @xmath53 / ( v \\beta_n)$ ] , with the partition function @xmath54 computed by an involving recursive procedure . here , @xmath55 is the system volume , which in a regular square lattice reads @xmath56 . in our examples",
    "we will consider this same protocol , but using a simpler numerical implimentation for @xmath54 . indeed , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath59 at @xmath16 ( for details see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by its turn",
    ", @xmath60 can be calculated from straightforward monte carlo simulations @xcite , where @xmath61 is the lattice @xmath62-layer configuration @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) if the @xmath62 and @xmath66 layers are equal ( different ) .",
    "a central point is that in principle eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) would hold true only for infinite size systems .",
    "however , if @xmath3 is not too small , the above relation is extremely accurate and for any practical purpose gives the correct @xmath54 , as we show in the next section . such way to determine @xmath48 will be named the st ( exact ) free - energy method , st - fem .",
    "finally , we observe that approximations for @xmath49 are equally possible .",
    "one implementation being @xcite @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) the average energy at @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath70 s can be evaluated from direct auxiliary simulations .",
    "for completeness we will also consider this st approximated method , which we call st - am .",
    "s  generated by the pt and st algorithms in the case of a complex topography for the relevant microstate space ( resulting from specific parameters values ) .",
    "a higher sinuosity ( usually associated to smaller @xmath2 s ) represents a higher difficulty to leave the particular region of @xmath0 , full of energetic valleys and hills .",
    "the length of the paths are proportional to the number of steps taken by the algorithms . ]    the sampling of a statistical system when the phase space has a complicated landscape full of free - energy valleys and hills @xcite is particularly delicate : one needs to uniformly visit different regions of @xmath0 @xcite ( those more important for the given parameters ) , but which are separated by many entropic barriers @xcite . in this case , the particular way in which a method evolves throughout the microstates space to generate @xmath1  even with the use of enhanced procedures  may crucially determine the final outcome of sampling . for instance , non - ergodic `` probing '' of the multiple domains @xcite can prevent the proper relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "the previous comments fit perfectly well first - order phase transitions , where the minima of the free - energy are separated by large barriers .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that for second - order phase transitions , the divergence of time and spatial length correlations creates strongly correlated configurations @xcite .",
    "it leads to a certain clusterization of relevant parts of @xmath0 at the critical point , with independent and unbiased @xmath1 difficult to obtain .",
    "so , although associated to different mechanisms , near both first and second order transitions we can expect a `` fragmented '' phase space . hence , even if the pt and st are not crucially distinct in usual situations ( in fact , the st being slight better than the pt in few instances @xcite ) , here we argue qualitatively that in such cases the pt can outperform the st",
    "thus , for the above contexts of multiple basins @xcite , the fig .",
    "2 schematically represents `` stretches '' of typical dynamical paths generated by the st and pt algorithms .",
    "the successively visited @xmath71 s until leaving the domain  delimited by high local free - energy barriers ( or cluster walls )  can form a very sinuous trajectory on that particular region of @xmath0 due to a complex topography .",
    "thus , consider first the st , fig .",
    "2 ( a ) . the initial microstate @xmath72 evolves ( at @xmath19 ) in a very tortuous path , but in average towards the border of the domain , reaching @xmath73 after @xmath27 steps .",
    "then , it undergoes a temperature change @xmath74 and again evolves @xmath27 steps getting to @xmath75 , this time in a more straight trajectory because the higher @xmath2 ( note if there was no temperature change , the path would follow the dashed line displayed in the plot ) . finally , there is a second successful attempt to change @xmath2 , @xmath76 , and after @xmath27 steps the system ends up very close to the barrier separating the basins .    in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) we observe the pt dynamics , where just one successful temperature exchange takes place ( between the only two replicas depicted ) . the microstate @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is obtained from @xmath72 after @xmath79 steps at @xmath19 ( @xmath80 ) . obviously , @xmath75 in the st must be in average closer to ( farther from ) the domain border than @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) in the pt implementation .",
    "then , there is an exchange of temperatures and the evolution of @xmath78 at @xmath81 , after @xmath82 steps , already makes the replica to cross the basin barrier to the microstate @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , after @xmath84 the state @xmath77 at @xmath85 leads to a @xmath86 close to the border .    the above illustration ",
    "although certainly not extinguishing all the possibilities  is already representative of why the pt can be more efficient in sampling a space full of energetic valleys and hills ( e.g. , at phase transition regimes ) .",
    "it is so for the following reasons : ( i ) in the pt , the existence of replicas at all the interval @xmath87 of temperatures generate some paths which more quickly will approach the domain borders , as seen in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) for @xmath88 at @xmath85 . moreover , the microstates along such trajectories at higher @xmath2 s of course are usually more energetic .",
    "( ii ) so , when finally there is an exchange of temperature , a microstate of high energy , even if now at lower @xmath2 s , will demand a smaller number of steps to cross a barrier ( like @xmath89 in fig . 2 ( b ) ) , and thus to start visiting other basins . on the other hand , trajectories of microstates of low energy , that during a certain @xmath90 have evolved under small values of @xmath2 s , e.g. @xmath91 in fig",
    "2 ( b ) , when shifting to higher temperatures will speed up their ways towards the barrier ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "note , nevertheless , that this is possible _ only _ if non - adjacent exchanges are allowed , the case we are assuming here .",
    "( iii ) the above collective dynamics makes possible many of the replicas successfully leave a domain after fairly similar number of steps .",
    "hence , once in another basin region , this `` parallel '' process can proceed in the same fashion .",
    "( iv ) by its turn , we can face the st as a `` serial '' process , then a faster drift towards the domain walls takes place only when @xmath2 increases . as a consequence , the eventual more frequent temperature exchange for the st @xcite not necessarily constitutes an advantage in complex @xmath0 landscapes ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "lastly , a not critical issue but which also may give some small advantage for the pt over the st is that in the former , often the replicas ( even at smaller @xmath2 s ) cross the domain high barriers more or less at the same time .",
    "thus , once leaving a certain basin we already have a sample of microstates at @xmath81 to make averages for the pt . as displayed in the fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , for the st it may happen that when the system reaches a microstate configuration able to cross the barrier , it is not at @xmath81 .",
    "hence , an extra time is necessary for the system ( naturally from the algorithm dynamics ) to come back to @xmath81 and so the averages to be performed .",
    "we finally observe that when the relevant space is more homogeneous in energy ( e.g. , far away from phase transitions ) , one should not expect so high increase of the trajectories sinuosity as we diminish @xmath2 .",
    "then , it is not difficult to realize that the listed differences between the pt and st methods might not be important .",
    "the previous discussion is based on qualitative arguments .",
    "of course , they should be corroborated by concrete quantitative studies .",
    "next we analyze two systems near phase transition conditions .",
    "we will explicit show through detailed numerical simulations that indeed the pt algorithm is more efficient , specially in the case of first order phase transitions .",
    "the model is defined by the following hamiltonian @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes nearest - neighbors pairs @xmath95 and @xmath96 of a @xmath97-dimensional lattice of @xmath98 sites . at each site @xmath95",
    ", the spin variable assumes the values @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 is the interaction energy and @xmath101 is the magnetic field .",
    "the ising model displays a second - order phase transition ( ferromagnetic  paramagnetic ) at @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for a square lattice ( @xmath104 ) ,",

    "( [ acf ] ) . regarding the parameters , we choose @xmath115 and a square lattice of @xmath116 .",
    "all the results are given in units of @xmath107 . to test the accuracy of the transfer matrix largest eigenvalue method in obtaing @xmath117 , in fig .",
    "3 we compare the exact partition function ( obtained from the solution in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with that calculated from eq . ( [ e4 ] ) for the ising model and the above parameters .",
    "the agreement is indeed remarkable , indicating that even for @xmath116 , @xmath117 and consequently @xmath52 is already very close to the thermodynamic limit value .",
    "figure 4 displays @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 . in the simulations we use only two replicas ( with @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 . from the plots we see that the auto - correlations decay faster when calculated by the pt than by both the st - am and st - fem methods . in fig .",
    "5 we compare the time evolution of the thermodynamic quantities starting from a `` hard '' initial condition , i.e. , a configuration very different from the ones representative of the steady state .",
    "thus , we consider a fully ordered configuration , which obviously is not typical at @xmath123 .",
    "this is a way of testing how efficient is a certain approach to drive the system to the stationary state .",
    "the ising model at the transition temperature evolves to the equilibrium basically in the same fashion either when simulated by the pt or by both the st s .",
    "so , we have that for a continuous phase transition ( at least for the ising model ) the performances of the two tempering methods are essentially equivalent .",
    "although at @xmath9 the pt shows faster auto - correlation decays ( in contrast with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the same model , however calculated far away from the critical temperature ) , the stationary state is characterized by equivalent values of @xmath110 and @xmath109 for all methods .",

    "for instance , we show in fig .",
    "6 the time evolution of @xmath147 towards the steady state , starting from a fully random initial configuration .",
    "we also consider distinct number of replicas @xmath13 and temperature intervals @xmath166 .",
    "we find that under the same simulation conditions , generally the pt converges faster , being closer to the cluster results than the st ( st - fem and st - am ) .",
    "however , for the lower value of @xmath167 , in all cases the system ( up to @xmath168 mc steps ) can not even escape the region near the initial random configuration . on the other hand , by increasing @xmath160  although the probability for temperature exchanging decreases  the system starts to move towards the stationary regime . furthermore , the larger the number of replicas @xmath13 , the faster the convergence .",
    "finally we mention that the steady value of @xmath169 at @xmath170 can be understood recalling that at the phase coexistence , two liquid phases ( @xmath165 ) coexist with one gas phase ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "since their weights are equal ( 1/3 ) , we have @xmath171 for any system size .",

    "the averages are taken at each @xmath174 mc steps . in the inset ,",
    "exactly the same curve but for the averages at each @xmath175 mc steps . ]",
    "another interesting test is to perform the numerical simulations when the system is already at the steady state . in fig .",
    "7 we show the time evolution of the `` magnetization '' @xmath110 for both tempering methods at the phase coexistence . in the plots",
    "the time is shifted so to discard the @xmath17 initial mc steps necessary for equilibration .",

    "7 we show only two distinct simulation stretches ) .",
    "actually , the pt tunneling pattern presents the same behavior than that observed in the notorious accurate cluster algorithm @xcite , fig .",

    "ii.c to explain why the pt should be more efficient than the st around first - order phase transitions .",
    "a different efficiency for the methods is observed not just at the phase coexistence , but also for other values of the chemical potential @xmath153 around @xmath176 .",
    "figure 9 plots the order parameter @xmath147 versus @xmath153 for the pt and st implementations , evaluating the averages at each @xmath177 mc steps .",
    "note that overall the pt is already quite close to the values obtained from the cluster algorithm , whereas both st still show some discrepancy , specially for @xmath178 .",
    "if now the averages are calculate each @xmath179 mc steps , the st also becomes closer to the cluster s ( inset of fig .",
    "9 ) . once more",
    "such results can be understood in terms of the tunneling between the phases . for @xmath180",
    ", we still can expect high free energy barriers . with the st ,",
    "the system does not cross such barriers a sufficient number of times if @xmath177 . by increasing the number of mc steps for the averages ,",
    "we generate a more representative @xmath1 and thus a better estimation for @xmath110 .     from the pt ( continuous ) , st - fem ( dashed ) and st - am ( dotted ) . ]     for the pt and st - fem .",
    "the symbols @xmath181 refers , respectively , to exchanges allowed between first , second and third neighbors ( see main text ) . ]    as a last efficiency measure , we consider the two relevant auto - correlation functions , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , shown in fig .",
    "we should note that although time displaced correlation functions are more commonly studied in the context of continuous phase transitions , in the present case they are an interesting auxiliary tool to compare the pt and st performances . as it should be , the st - fem uncorrelates faster than the st - am .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the @xmath10 s decay even faster for the pt method ( in fact , with a very drastic difference in the case of @xmath183 ) .",
    "usually , the frequency ( measured in terms of a probability @xmath184 ) in which a given tempering method changes the system temperature is taken as a good indication of its efficiency .",
    "for the pt and st algorithms , such quantity respectively reads @xcite @xmath185 \\ } \\rangle$ ] and @xmath186 \\}\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the averages are over @xmath187 , such that @xmath184 of order @xmath188 is the mean from all the exchanges among @xmath189 and @xmath190 ( see sec .",
    "ii.a ) .    in fig .",
    "11 we display @xmath184 as function of @xmath19 for the pt and st - fem ( the st - am being similar to the latter ) , with @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "as it can be seen , for any @xmath188 the st always presents a higher probability of acceptance than the pt , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "such findings are in contrast with our results here . indeed , larger @xmath184 s do not translate into a better performance of the st , at least in the case of phase transitions as argued in sec .",
    "therefore , exchange probabilities alone should be faced with care when trying to characterize the best tempering method for a certain context .",
    "finally , we show in figs .",
    "12 and 13 finite size analysis for the total density @xmath147 and the isothermal susceptibility @xmath193 from the pt and st - fem .",
    "continuous lines correspond to fitting curves by a method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the phase coexistence ,",
    "thermodynamic quantities scale with the system volume @xcite .",
    "a discontinuous phase transition is characterized by a jump in the order parameter or even a delta function - like singularity for the susceptibility or specific heat .",
    "but this is so only at the thermodynamic limit . for finite systems not only the order parameter , but also other quantities are described by continuous functions @xcite .",
    "we should emphasizes that smooth curves are obtained only when one uses a simulation dynamics which correctly yields an appropriate sampling .",
    "for instance , from simple metropolis algorithms , neither the crossing among isotherms nor accurate finite size analysis for smooth curves are possible .",
    "it is due to the presence of hysteresis effects @xcite , which hence demand tempering enhanced algorithm . from the plots we see that both the pt and st give fairly good results .",
    "however , the cluster continuous curve @xcite is smoother and better fitted in the pt case , specially for the larger @xmath194 value .     versus @xmath153 for @xmath3 equal to 10 ( circle ) , 20 ( square ) and 30 ( triangle ) , calculated from the ( a ) pt and ( b ) st - fem .",
    "continuous lines are fitting results @xcite .",
    "the curves collapse if plotted as @xmath195 ( insets ) . ]     for @xmath3 equal to 10 ( circle ) , 20 ( square ) and 30 ( triangle ) , calculated from the ( a ) pt and ( b ) st - fem .",
    "the curves collapse if plotted as @xmath196 ( insets ) . ]",
    "in this paper we have presented a comparative study between two important enhanced sampling methods , namely , simulated ( st ) and parallel ( pt ) tempering , considering spin - lattice models at phase transition conditions .",
    "special attention has been payed to first - order phase transitions at low temperatures ( for the beg model ) . in such regimes ,",
    "more standard algorithms often give poor results because their difficulties to overcome the large free - energy barriers in the phase space , leading , e.g. , to ergodicity breaking and artificial algorithm - induced hysteresis .",
    "we also have investigated the less critical case of second order - phase transition  for which no free - energy barriers exist but there is the formation of strongly correlated clusters ( basin regions ) @xcite  for the well understood ising model .    as for the tempering implementations ,",
    "we have followed the usual pt procedure , but allowing temperature exchanges between non - adjacent replicas .",
    "for the temperature change probability weights @xmath49 in the st , we have assumed a recent proposed approximation @xcite ( st - am ) and a new alternative exact approach ( st - fem ) , based on the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "the st - fem here is formally similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , but avoids the necessity to implement more complicated recursive procedures to estimate the partition function .    different comparative analysis , both at the transient regime and already at the steady state , have been carried out . despite the facts that : ( i ) after long times ( thus demanding large computational effort ) the final results from the pt and st are similar ; and",
    "( ii ) the pt displays a smaller exchange probability than the st ; we have found that for discontinuous phase transitions the pt is always more efficient in any verified aspect .",
    "the main reason for this is basically that the pt enables the system to cross free - energy barriers more frequently than the st : either at or near phase coexistence conditions ( as explicit illustrated , e.g. , in figs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) ) . furthermore , besides the quantitative numerical results",
    ", we also have presented heuristic arguments for why it should be expected .",
    "results for the instructive ising model at the critical temperature ( second - order phase transition ) have also agreed with our qualitative predictions .",
    "indeed , far away from @xmath9 it has been reported a faster convergence for the st @xcite .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath197 just the opposite takes place , with the auto - correlations decaying faster for the pt .",
    "for completeness , we also have analyzed other values of @xmath152 for the beg model ( not shown ) , in particular for @xmath198 , the so called blume - capel model .",
    "the calculations at the first - order transition ( @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) have corroborated the higher efficiency of the pt over the st .",
    "more specifically , until @xmath201 , the system when simulated with the st - am has not reached the steady state , whose values for the thermodynamic quantities were different from those obtained by the st - fem , pt and cluster algorithms .",
    "furthermore , the st - fem have agreed with the pt and cluster only for long @xmath202 s .",
    "time - displaced correlation functions decays and actual thermodynamic quantities convergence were always faster for the pt .    a second contribution of this work has been an ( numerically simpler ) alternative way to calculate the exact @xmath49 in the st method .",
    "when comparing the st - am with the st - fem , we have found that the st - fem allows the system to converge to steady regime quicker than the st - am ( see above ) .",
    "in addition , at the steady state , configurations generated by st - fem uncorrelate faster than those by the st - am . on the other hand , with respect to the frequency in which the system tunnels between different phases at the coexistence and the final sough thermodynamic quantities , both implementations are similar , but the latter only for long @xmath202 s .",
    "summarizing , at phase transition regimes the pt and st provide the same results for long ( sometimes even costly ) simulations .",
    "however , we find that for all the tested measures , the parallel converges faster than the simulated tempering .",
    "also , even in such situation of a better performance from the pt , still the rate of temperature switching is higher for the st .",
    "thus , another message from our work is that alone , the switching rates are not sufficient to characterize the efficiency of a tempering enhanced sampling algorithm .",
