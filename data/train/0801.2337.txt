    "indeed , considering the interaction of two gss belonging to different species , one may expect that the interplay of the attractive interaction with the negative mass will split the gs pair .",

    "the solitons may be of intra- and inter - gap types @xcite , with the two components sitting , respectively , in the same gap or different gaps .",
