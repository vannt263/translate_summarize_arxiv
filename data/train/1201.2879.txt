    "wolf - rayet(wr ) bubbles are the final result of the evolution of the circumstellar medium ( csm ) of massive stars with initial masses @xmath835 @xmath9 .",
    "these stars exhibit high mass - loss rates throughout their lives , peaking during their post - main - sequence evolution that involves a red or yellow supergiant ( rsg or ysg ) or luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stage ( e.g. , ) during which the mass - loss rate can be as high as @xmath10@xmath11 yr@xmath7 , although the stellar wind velocity is low ( @xmath12-@xmath13  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the final wr stage is characterized by a fast stellar wind ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath7 ) , which sweeps up , shocks , and compresses the rsg / lbv material .",
    "thin - shell and rayleigh - taylor instabilities lead to the corrugation and eventual fragmentation of the swept - up shell .",
    "clumpy wr wind - blown bubbles have been detected at optical wavelengths around @xmath010 wr stars in our galaxy . their optical emission is satisfactorily modeled as photoionized dense clumps and shell material .",
    "x - ray emission has been detected so far in only two wr bubbles , ngc6888 and s308 .",
    "the most sensitive x - ray observations of a wr bubble are those of the northwest ( nw ) quadrant of s308 presented by @xcite .",
    "their _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn x - ray spectrum of s308 revealed very soft x - ray emission dominated by the he - like triplet at @xmath00.43  kev and declining sharply toward higher energies .",
    "this spectrum was fit with a two - temperature optically thin mekal plasma emission model , with a cold main component at @xmath15  kev ( i.e. , @xmath16  k ) , and a hot secondary component at @xmath17  kev contributing @xmath186% of the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the comparison of the x - ray and optical h@xmath19 and [ ] images of s308 showed that the x - ray emission is confined by the ionized shell .    in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of three additional _ xmm - newton _ observations of s308 , which , in conjunction with those of the nw quadrant presented by @xcite , map 90% of this wr bubble ( see  2 ) . in  3 and  4 we discuss the spatial distribution and spectral properties of the x - ray - emitting plasma in s308 , respectively . in  5 we present our results of the x - ray emission from the central star in the wr bubble .",
    "a discussion is presented in  6 and summary and conclusions in  7 .",
    "the unrivaled sensitivity of the _ xmm - newton _ epic cameras to large - scale diffuse emission makes them the preferred choice for the observation of s308 . @xcite",
    "presented _ xmm - newton _ observations of the brightest nw quadrant of s308 , but the large angular size of s308 ( @xmath040  in diameter ) exceeds the field of view of the epic camera and a significant fraction of the nebula remained unobserved . to complement these observations , additional _ xmm - newton _ observations of three overlapping fields covering the northeast ( ne ) , southwest ( sw ) , and southeast ( se ) quadrants of the nebula have been obtained .",
    "the previous and new observations result in the coverage of @xmath090% of the area of s308 .",
    "the pointings , dates and revolutions of the observations , and their exposure times are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the individual observations by the quadrant of s308 that is covered , namely the nw , ne , sw , and se quadrants .",
    "all observations were obtained using the medium filter and the extended full - frame mode for epic - pn and full - frame mode for epic - mos .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,>,>,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : wr ]    the central star of s308 is wr6 ( a.k.a",
    ".  hd50896 ) , which has a spectral subtype wn4 .",
    "the star is detected by the _ xmm - newton _ epic cameras in the ne and sw pointings of the nebula .",
    "the epic - pn , epic - mos1 , and epic - mos2 count rates are 160@xmath204 counts  ks@xmath7 , 65@xmath202 counts  ks@xmath7 , and 65@xmath202 counts  ks@xmath7 , respectively , from the ne observation , and 141@xmath204 counts  ks@xmath7 , 53@xmath202 counts  ks@xmath7 , and 52@xmath202 counts  ks@xmath7 , respectively , from the sw observation using a source aperture of @xmath21 in radius .",
    "these count rates appear to imply that the x - ray luminosity of wr6 diminished by 1020% from the ne to the sw observations , which were only @xmath22  hours apart57  from wr6 .",
    "the flux from this source is @xmath23% that of wr6 and thus it is not likely that fraction of the emission from this source entering into the aperture used for wr6 would contribute significantly to the observed x - ray variability . ] .",
    "we note , however , that these count rates are largely affected by vignetting due to the offset position of wr6 on the epic cameras . indeed , the light curves shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , after accounting for the effects of vignetting , may imply the opposite , i.e. , that the x - ray flux of wr6 was slightly higher in the second ( sw ) observation than in the first ( ne ) observation .    in figure  [",
    "fig : wr_spectrum ] we present the epic background - subtracted spectra for the two different epochs .",
    "following @xcite , we have modeled these spectra with a two - temperature vapec model with initial abundances set to those shown in table  1 of .",
    "the fit allowed the foreground absorption column density , temperatures , and abundances of n , ne , mg , si , and fe to vary @xcite .",
    "table 3 displays the parameters resulting from our best - fit models : absorption column densities @xmath24 , plasma temperatures @xmath25 , normalization parameters @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the distance , @xmath28 is the electron density , and @xmath29 the volume in cgs units . ] , observed ( absorbed ) fluxes @xmath30 , and intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) fluxes @xmath31 .",
    "model fits for the spectra from the ne and sw observations are listed separately alongside those from @xcite for comparison . the column density and temperatures of the two components",
    "are within 1-@xmath32 of one another among the three different models .",
    "the observed fluxes are also consistent , although the @xcite flux seems to be a bit lower , while our fluxes are closer to the ones derived from the october 1995 _ asca _ observations of wr6 @xcite .",
    "the total observed fluxes and the observed fluxes of the hot thermal component , @xmath33 , listed in table  [ tab : wr ] may indicate a hardening of the x - ray emission from wr6 during the last observation . to assess this issue , we performed statistical evaluation of the lightcurves showed in figure  [ fig : lc ] using the heasoft task _ lcstats _ and found no significant variations .",
    "thus , wr6 does not show evidence of variability in time - scales of hours .",
    "we would like to point out that the absorption column density obtained from our best fits are in good agreement with the values obtained from @xcite , which are higher than that used to fit the soft x - ray emission from the nebula .",
    "such higher column density values are commonly observed towards massive stars such as wr stars and are recognized to be caused by absorption at the base of the wind .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ images and spectra analyzed in the previous sections reveal that the hot plasma in s308 is spatially distributed in a thick shell plus the northwest blowout , with most emission being attributable to a hot plasma at @xmath01.1@xmath210@xmath3 k. for an adiabatically shocked stellar wind , its temperature is determined by the stellar wind velocity , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mean particle mass for fully ionized gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature expected for the shocked stellar wind of wr6 , with a terminal wind velocity of 1700  km  s@xmath7 and @xmath36 , would be @xmath37  k , in sharp contrast with the observed temperature .",
    "the same issue has been pointed out for the wr bubble ngc6888 by several authors ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and it is also a common issue in planetary nebulae ( e.g. , ngc6543 ; * ? ? ?",
    "electron thermal conduction has been proposed as a mechanism capable of reducing the temperature of the hot plasma in shocked stellar wind bubbles .",
    "thermal conduction was applied by @xcite to stellar wind bubbles to produce a self - similar solution for the density and temperature structure in bubbles .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosities predicted by weaver et al.s model for the omega nebula and the rosette nebula , according to the stellar wind parameters of their associated young clusters ( m17 and ngc2244 , respectively ) , are several orders of magnitude higher than those observed @xcite .",
    "thus , the standard weaver et al .  model for a stellar wind bubble with thermal conduction can not be taken at face value .",
    "recent work by in the context of planetary nebulae , which are produced in a very similar manner to wr wind bubbles , has calculated the time - dependent radiation - hydrodynamic evolution of planetary nebula wind bubbles including thermal conduction in 1d models with spherical symmetry . in these models , the cold shell material from the previous agb superwind phase",
    "is evaporated into the hot bubble .",
    "saturated conduction was taken into account in these calculations by limiting the electron mean free path and it was found that thermal conduction was able to lower the temperature and raise the density at the edge of the hot bubble enough to explain the soft x - ray emission and low x - ray luminosities observed in some planetary nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the case of wr bubbles , @xcite presented time - dependent 2d radiation - hydrodynamic models of the evolution of the csm around single massive stars , including classical and saturated thermal conduction .",
    "they found that in the absence of a magnetic field , thermal conduction does not seem to play an important role in shaping wr bubbles , but that models with thermal conduction have slightly greater soft - band luminosities than those without thermal conduction .",
    "they suggested that the morphology of s308 could result from a star with initial mass of 40  @xmath38 whose stellar evolution model includes stellar rotation .",
    "they obtained that @xmath020,000  yr after the onset of the wr phase , the x - ray - emitting gas will present a clump - like morphology with an electron density of @xmath39  @xmath40 inside an optical ( @xmath41  k ) shell with radius of @xmath42  pc .",
    "whereas the @xcite models reproduce the morphology and x - ray luminosity of wind - blown bubbles , their simulations predict higher temperatures of the hot plasma that result in x - ray spectra that do not match the observed spectral shape .",
    "this might imply that additional physical processes must be taken into account .",
    "an interesting alternative to thermal conduction for the apparently low ionization state of the plasma is non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) .",
    "@xcite calculate the timescales to reach collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) for ionized plasmas and their results suggest that , for values of the parameters relevant to s308 ( derived electron density and time in the wr stage ; @xcite ) , the cie assumptions may not hold .",
    "these ideas will be pursued in subsequent works .",
    "we present _ xmm - newton _ observations of three fields of the wr bubble s308 which , in conjunction with the observation of its nw quadrant presented by @xcite , map most of the nebula except for its southernmost section .",
    "we have used these observations to study the spatial distribution of the x - ray - emitting material within this bubble , to derive global values for its physical conditions ( @xmath43 , @xmath28 ) , and to search for their spatial variations among different morphological components of the nebula .    the x - ray emission from s308 is found to have a limb - brightened morphology , with a shell thickness 58 , and extend to the northwest blowout region .",
    "the x - ray - emitting shell is notably larger along the se - nw direction than along the sw - ne direction , and it is always confined by the optical shell of ionized material .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness decreases notably from the blowout region and the western rim shell to the shell interior , where the x - ray emission falls to background levels .",
    "the western quadrants are also brighter than the eastern quadrants .    the x - ray emission from s308 shows prominent emission from the he - like triplet of at 0.43  kev and fainter emission of the 0.57  kev triplet , and declines towards high energies , with a faint tail up to 1  kev .",
    "this spectrum can be described by a two - temperature optically thin plasma emission model with temperatures @xmath44  k and @xmath45  k. the latter component is notably fainter than the former by at least a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "there is an appreciable difference in the relative contributions of the hot component to the x - ray - emitting gas between the rim and the nebula interior , of which the latter has a higher contribution from the hard component .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity is estimated to be @xmath47  erg  s@xmath7 for a distance of 1.5  kpc .",
