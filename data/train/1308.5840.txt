    "<S> the localization problem for massive fermions in the 5d standing wave braneworld is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion generations on the brane are explained by the existence of three nodes of standing waves in the bulk , where the left and right modes of the 5d fermion are localized and dirac - type couplings mixes them . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this model the structure of peaks of the left and right fermion wavefunctions in extra dimension leads to the observed mass spectrum of the up and down quark families .    0.3 cm pacs numbers : 04.50.-h , 11.25.-w , 11.27.+d    0.5 cm    the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is very successful and has been tested by experiments with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> however , from the theoretical perspective , there still exist several puzzles , such as the origin of the fermion masses , their mixing and three generations structure . at present </S>",
    "<S> it seems that we do not have satisfactory theoretical framework to explain these phenomena and an extensions of the sm is believed to be necessary . </S>",
    "<S> there have been several approaches to address the above problem beyond sm , a popular way is the introduction of the family symmetry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> large extra dimensions have also been proposed to address problems in flavor physics ( see , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the split fermions model @xcite the sm fields are confined to a thick brane with the fermions localized in specific points in the bulk . if the fermion wavefunctions are highly peaked in the extra dimension , a small relative shift between the peaks leads to a large suppression of the effective yukawa coupling due to the smallness of the overlap of the wavefunctions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider a similar model within the 5d standing wave braneworld scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we connect fermion families with the existence of nodes of standing waves in the bulk where various modes of the single 5d fermion field reside .    </S>",
    "<S> the 5d standing wave braneworld is formed by the background solution to the coupled einstein and massless ghost scalar field equations @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the extra space - like coordinate and @xmath2 is a curvature scalar . </S>",
    "<S> standing waves in the bulk are generated by the oscillatory function : @xmath3 whith @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the oscillation frequency , @xmath6 is the integration constant and @xmath7 is the bessel function of the second kind of order two .    </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory function ( [ u ] ) enters the equations of matter fields via the contravariant components of the metric tensor : @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the frequency of standing waves , @xmath5 , is much larger than the frequencies associated with the energies of particles on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> it allows us to perform the time averaging of the fast oscillating exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the non - vanishing time averages are determined by the formula @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the modified bessel function of order zero and @xmath11 is given by ( [ z ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> the nodes of the standing wave can be considered as the 4d space - time islands , where the matter particles are assumed to be bound . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows the replication of fermions families is connected with the existence of such islands.    in our previous papers @xcite we have considered the localization problem in the case of a single node , i.e. when @xmath7 in ( [ z ] ) has a single zero at the position of the brane , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this was accomplished by the assumption , @xmath18 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the 5d dirac equation has zero mode solutions which correspond to the 4d left fermion stuck at @xmath19 and the right fermion localized in the bulk @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the model ( [ metric ] ) with three nodes and the fine tuned parameters : @xmath20 in this case there appear three additional nodes of the bulk standing wave distributed symmetrically with respect the central node . </S>",
    "<S> fig @xmath21 shows the shape of the determinant @xmath22 in ( [ co ] ) along the extra dimension @xmath1 .        </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , there appear several fermionic modes which are stuck at different points in the brane of the width @xmath23 , as it is described in @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> let us write the 4d dirac equations for the particles of mass @xmath44 with the momentum @xmath45 along the brane : @xmath46 then the 5d dirac equation yields : @xmath47 \\rho(r ) = 0 ~,\\\\ \\lambda'(r ) + m e^{-a|r| } \\rho(r ) + \\left [ k - m \\right ] \\lambda(r ) = 0~ , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where we use the notation : @xmath48 z'~.\\ ] ] near to the origin @xmath49 the solutions of ( [ gant1 ] ) are : @xmath50}e^{-2ar } ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> indeed , the first two terms in ( [ action2 ] ) are convergent over @xmath1 and the third term vanishes , because @xmath54 is an even and @xmath55 is an odd function of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    now , let us consider the last term of the action ( [ action2 ] ) which corresponds to the 4d fermion masses : @xmath56\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{dr}{i_0(z ) \\sqrt{i_0(2z ) } } ~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we connect the fermion families with the existence of several peaks of wave functions which are located at different points in the bulk , and use the fine tuning ( [ firstzerosy ] ) to ensure that @xmath54 and @xmath55 acquire three peaks ( see fig @xmath57 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain several dimensional parameters in the model : the distances between the peaks and nodes of the left and right fermion wavefunctions , which can be used to explain the mass spectrum of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion masses are obtained from ( [ m ] ) , where we impose different limits of integration in order to take into account the overlaps of various left and right fermionic modes .    for example , for three down quarks ( @xmath58 in ( [ m ] ) ) , @xmath59 the integration limits @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , green lines on fig @xmath57 ) are defined as the distances from the first peak of the left wavefunction , @xmath62 , to the first , second and third nodes of the right wavefunction @xmath39 , respectively . from the experiments we know : @xmath63 and the mysterious large mass ratios </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath64 have to be explained . if the parameters of our model are fixed so that @xmath65 then from fig @xmath57 we see that the upper limits of integration : @xmath60 in ( [ mi ] ) , acquire the values : @xmath66 then from ( [ mi ] ) we obtain the masses of down quark families which are consistent with the observed ratios ( [ frac ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of up quarks : @xmath67 the mass ratios between the generations are : @xmath68 now let us assume @xmath69 in ( [ m ] ) and write @xmath70 where the limits of integration , @xmath71 , are the second peak of @xmath62 at @xmath72 and the first , second and third nodes of @xmath55 , respectively ( see brown lines on fig @xmath57 ) , i.e. @xmath73 then , by using the values of the parameters ( [ parameters ] ) , we are able to obtain from ( [ mi2 ] ) the observed mass ratios of up quarks in ( [ ratios ] ) .    as a consequence of our choice of the parameters ( [ parameters ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the brane width takes the value , @xmath74 and , as it is clear from fig @xmath21 , the third node of the standing wave is located outside the brane . from fig @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> we see that three peaks of the left fermion wavefunction @xmath62 are inside the brane , though , the first one , which is located at @xmath19 , does not appear on fig @xmath57 due to the logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic scale on fig @xmath21 and fig @xmath57 has to be used in order to display the complete structure of the peaks and nodes when the amplitudes of oscillations close to the origin are large . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , all three peaks of the right fermion wavefunction @xmath39 are found in the bulk and the third one is even situated outside of the brane and still overlaps with the left wavefunctions inside the thick brane .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have explained the mass ratios of up and down quarks using the dimensionless notations ( [ parameters ] ) . to obtain the mass spectrum we first need to specify the physical units . according to ( [ mu ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the 5d fermionic mass , @xmath75 , which is taken to be of the order of the curvature scale @xmath76 in ( [ parameters ] ) , should exceed the 4d mass of any quark . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the minimal model we can take @xmath77 then the observed mass spectrum of all down and up quarks in ( [ m_d ] ) and ( [ m_u ] ) can be reproduced if @xmath78 in ( [ mi ] ) and ( [ mi2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we considered the 5d standing wave braneworld with three nodes of the standing wave in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right fermionic wavefunctions on this background have three sharp peaks at different points in the extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these peaks can be connected with the fermion families and show that the observed mass spectrum of up and down quark families can be obtained by the proper choice of the free parameters of the model . </S>"
