    "the interplay of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and strong electronic correlations is an important theme in condensed matter physics .",
    "the competition between these mechanisms leads to many novel phases of matter with exciting technological properties , including spin liquid phases @xcite . to date , the primary focus of this research has been on transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "however , soc is known to be significant in organic and organometallic materials , where many parameters are tunable by chemical substitutions @xcite . in such organometallic molecules ,",
    "soc is typically treated as a property of single atoms .",
    "only a handful of materials have been identified as candidate spin liquids , @xcite and there is some suggestion that mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 could be among them @xcite .",
    "mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 is a single component organometallic molecular insulator with localized magnetic moments , but no long - range magnetic order @xcite .",
    "it has been seen to have a layered tight - binding lattice @xcite .    the layered lattice of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kagomene ] ) leads to dirac points , quasi-1d bands , and topological states @xcite .",
    "this lattice ( known variously as the decorated honeycomb lattice , the star lattice , and the kagomene lattice ) supports topological insulating phases and a quantum spin - hall effect when spin - orbit coupling is included @xcite .",
    "we recently showed that @xmath2 molecules have a spin - molecular orbital coupling ( smoc ) due to orbital currents around the molecules , which can lead to anisotropic and direction dependent exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "these anisotropic exchange interactions can lead to the physical realisation of compass models ( the most studied of which is the spin-@xmath3 kitaev model ) @xcite . here",
    "we show that inter - molecular soc is significant in mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 and should not be neglected .",
    "multi - nuclear organometallic complexes thus have all of the required features to realise compass models .",
    "the chemical modifications possible in these materials provide an avenue for tuning the parameters of such models to enhance these effects .",
    "s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 , known as the decorated honeycomb lattice , the star lattice , and the kagomene lattice ; the latter since it interpolates between the kagom lattice and the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the kagom - like hopping ( black ) is labeled @xmath4 , while the graphene - like hopping ( green ) is labeled @xmath5 . the full 3d lattice stacks layers of the kagomene lattice directly on top of one another in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "an example of the in - plane next - nearest neighbour hopping @xmath7 ( red ) is also indicated ; this hopping is chiral ( it preserves inversion symmetry between the pair of molecules while breaking the reflection symmetry , as there is no reflection plane in the crystal ) . ]    here we report a powerful demonstration of the wannier orbital construction technique - the determination of first principles intra- and inter - molecular spin - orbit coupling parameters for mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 from a four component relativistic calculation .",
    "these parameters come naturally from the computation of a first principles hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",
    "the wannier orbital ( wo ) overlaps in this relativistic calculation include both regular hopping terms and spin - orbit coupling terms .",
    "the largest effects of relativity are captured by a simple model of molecular angular momentum states ( analogous to the usual treatment of atomic angular momentum states ) .",
    "both intra- and inter - molecular spin - orbit coupling overlaps are present , and may play an important role in determining the ground state properties of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 . by applying this first principles relativistic parameterization proceedure we can better understand the path to designing compass models in molecular crystals .",
    "s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 molecules , with molybdenum atoms in purple , carbon in brown , and sulphur in yellow .",
    "the canting of the dmit ligands and the vertical asymmetry of the mo@xmath0s@xmath1 core means that this molecule has @xmath8 symmetry ; it is symmetric only under rotations by @xmath9 .",
    "the pair of molecules are related by an inversion centre , mapping site @xmath10 to @xmath11 . ]    in the absence of soc , the first principles hamiltonian of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : molyview ] ) is a layered ` kagomene ' lattice ; each molecule is a triangular ring of sites , connected to each other on a stacked chiral honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "it is thus an example of a @xmath8 complex , for which the form of the smoc hamiltonian is known @xcite .",
    "we breifly review that result .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian of the ( ring - like ) coordination complex is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an integer labeling the position of each site around the ring - like complex , @xmath14 creates an electron on site @xmath13 . in the case of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 , each ` site ' is a local wannier orbital with weight on one of the dmit ligands plus the molybdenum - sulfur core .",
    "this hamiltonian can be diagonalised by transforming to a bloch ( plane wave)-like basis on the ring , @xmath15 , with eigenvalues @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath18 ensures that these states transform as angular momentum under time reversal .",
    "since these molecular states are on a ring , this bloch - like momentum is equivalent to a molecular orbital angular momentum ; in this case an @xmath19 set of states ( much like atomic @xmath20-orbitals ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the analogy with atomic ( spherically symmetric ) spin - orbit coupling only holds for @xmath2 molecules with odd-@xmath21 . for even-@xmath21 , @xmath22 is non - integer , and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the molecular orbital angular momentum leads to a spin - orbit coupling interaction analagous to that in atomic orbital angular momentum states . for this system with @xmath8 symmetry , the spin - orbit coupling operator is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xmath28 if @xmath29 ( the spherically symmetric case ) , then @xmath30 .",
    "thus we have a molecular hamiltonian that includes spin orbit coupling , @xmath31 .",
    "we now embed this molecular model into the full lattice structure and compare it to four component dft computations .",
    "an _ ab initio _ hamiltonian for mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 has been constructed previously by producing localized wannier orbitals from a dft computation without spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "this approach is particularly well suited to organic and organo - metallic molecular crystals due to the separation of energy scales in this class of material @xcite .",
    "previous calculations on mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 included only scalar relativistic effects ; here we report a more intensive computation that includes a full four - component representation of the effects of relativity @xcite .",
    "we performed four - component `` full - relativistic '' dft calculations in an all - electron full - potential local orbital basis using the fplo package @xcite ; the density was converged on a @xmath32 @xmath33 mesh using the pbe generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "this four component calcuation includes complex dirac spinor fields , allowing for a more complete treatment of relativity than via a scalar correction .",
    "since the four - component calculation includes spin - orbit coupling , we must treat each spin explicitly ; we need separate wannier orbitals for each spin .",
    "localized wos were constructed from the twelve spinful bands closest to the fermi energy , and real - space overlaps were computed to construct an _ ab initio _ single electron hamiltonian .",
    "the complex overlaps between the wannier orbitals produced a spin - dependent model hamiltonian that includes tight - binding and relativistic effects .",
    "s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 determine its low energy physics .",
    "the three kramers pairs per molecule are related to each other by the @xmath34 symmetry of the molecule , and the two molecules per unit cell are related by an inversion centre between them .",
    "the real part of the spin - up component of one of the spin - up wannier orbitals is shown ( the other components are orders of magnitude smaller ) . ]    four component relativistic computations mix together spin - up with spin - down , and the ` large ' components of the dirac spinor with the ` small ' .",
    "thus the wannier functions are not simply complex scalar fields , they are complex four - vector fields .",
    "however , as one might hope , the ` small ' components are orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant ` large ' component , and only one of spin - up or spin - down is significant in each orbital , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : wf4comp ] .",
    "thus we can label the resulting wannier orbitals with specific spin labels . in this way we have constructed a localized basis of spin orbitals to use as a basis for constructing a first principles hamiltonian for mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 .",
    "the first principles single - electron hamiltonian for mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pauli vector .",
    "this general hamiltonian contains the regular hopping terms @xmath37 , the molecular spin - orbit coupling @xmath38 ( eq . [ eq : hsoc ] ) discussed above , as well as inter - molecular spin - orbit coupling terms .",
    "table i gives the single - electron coupling terms produced from the four component relativistic calculation ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , and the previously - determind scalar - relativistic equivalents ( @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "the first principles hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 contains the usual tight - binding hopping @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the spin - molecular orbital coupling ( for the @xmath8 case ) , and @xmath44 contains all of the inter - molecular spin - orbit coupling effects .

    "@xmath51 is an example of the path traversed by a hop @xmath37 ; interactions that are equivalent under @xmath8 are related by a @xmath8 rotation of @xmath40 , and those related by inversion are necessarily the same ( @xmath40 is a pseudovector ) .",
    "@xmath52 labels the origin of the @xmath10th wo as labeled in fig . 1 ( see ref @xcite for more details ) .",
    "@xmath53 is the interlayer lattice vector .",
    "the spin quantisation axis is parallel to @xmath53 , which is also the @xmath8 rotation axis of the molecules . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see this in the dft results as the spin orbit couplings along the @xmath54 and @xmath55 bonds are precisely zero , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as both of these couplings connect sites related by inversion symmetry .",
    "[ fig : soccompare ] shows the four component dft band structure as compared to the model with @xmath38 parameterised from the wannier overlaps .",
    "the degeneracies are lifted at the @xmath58 ( dirac ) and @xmath59 points . the full tight - binding model , eq .",
    "[ eq : hrel ] , reproduces the fine details of the four component dft .",
    "we stress that there is no fitting in determining the effective parameters : @xmath37 and @xmath60 ; they are determined directly from the matrix elements between wannier orbitals .",
    "the full parametrization is given in table i. nevertheless we also find that the simple smo hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ eq : hsoc ] , reproduces the essential physics and even provides reasonable quantitative agreement with the four component dft .",
    "the structure of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 is , as previously discussed , well represented by stacked layers of 2d kagomene sheets .",
    "the effects of spin - orbit coupling in 2d systems is a field of ongoing interest @xcite . in 2d systems , the gradients of the potential in the plane",
    "are expected to be quite different from those perpendicular to the plane , so these are considered separately @xmath61 . as",
    "such , it is natural to split @xmath62 into a ` rashba ' term , @xmath63 , that depends only on the gradient of the potential perpendicular to the 2d plane , and an ` so ' term , @xmath64 , that contains the in - plane gradients of the potential . in 2d ,",
    "@xmath65 , so the rashba term can cause spin - flips ( c.f .",
    "@xmath66 ) , and the so term is a spin - dependent hopping that does not flip spins ( c.f .",
    "@xmath67 ) .",
    "a previously studied relativistic model of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 s lattice at @xmath68 filling is found to have a quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) insulating phase for the parameter values we find here for mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , in contrast to the previous work@xcite , our orbital angular momentum model predicts contributions of both @xmath69 and @xmath70 on the clusters , and both of these terms are found to be non - zero in the relativistic dft .",
    "it is unclear how these and other additional relativistic contributions will modify the found qsh ground state .",
    "nevertheless mono - layer mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 may well demonstrate such a quantum spin - hall insulating ground state .",
    "it has been seen that triangular clusters coupled as mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 is in the @xmath71 plane and stacked in the @xmath6 direction lead to a quasi-1d spin chain known to have a topological haldane phase ground state , consistent with experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "it has further been argued that smoc can drive a phase transition from a topological ( haldane ) phase to a trivial phase in such chains @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of inter - cluster spin - orbit coupling on this topological ground state has not yet been considered .",
    "as table i shows , the intra - cluster spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath72 ) is of the same order as the intra - cluster terms ( all other @xmath73 ) . with this detailed model",
    ", one can now investigate the effects of these terms on the stability of the haldane phase .",
    "here we have demonstrated a powerful application of the wannier orbital construction technique , the computation of first principles spin - orbit coupling parameters in complex molecular materials . unlike atoms and atomic solids ,",
    "the form of spin - orbit coupling in molecular crystals is not the usual @xmath74 . in these systems ,",
    "relativistic effects are known to be important , but there has not been a robust strategy for incorporating them consistently . by using the wannier parameterization in a relativistic four component dft computation , one can determine the relativistic contributions and incorporate them into further modelling .    in mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 ,",
    "the leading relativistic effects are well described by a coupling between the spin@xmath75 electron and emergent spin@xmath76 molecular orbital angular momentum states .",
    "our first principles parameterization shows us that there are additional soc terms coupling molecules together .",
    "these intermolecular soc contributions have significant effects on , for example , the magnitude of the gap between bands at the @xmath59 and @xmath58 high - symmetry points .",
    "we also found that along inversion - symmetric bonds there are no relativistic contributions to the single - electron model , and gave a group - theoretic explanation for this observation . while the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling observed here is small ( @xmath77% ) , the chemical flexibility of molecular crystals allows us to tune the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling , intra - molecular hopping , and inter - molecular hopping @xcite . for example , in a tungsten analogue of mo@xmath0s@xmath1(dmit)@xmath0 , the spin - orbit coupling could scale up by as much as a factor of @xmath78 . at the same time , one could consider modifying the dmit ligands to reduce the inter - molecular hopping .",
    "the anisotropic exchange interactions caused by soc means that with this kind of control one could realise compass models such as the kitaev model in this class of molecular crystals .",
