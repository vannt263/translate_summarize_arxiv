    "the discovery of topological insulators in 2d and 3d has recently attracted a great deal of attention @xcite ( reference therein ) . the appearance of the gapless edge states within the bulk gap is generally believed to be a signature of the topological insulator .",
    "generally speaking , a topological insulator has gapless robust edge states while it s energy spectrum is gapped in the bulk .",
    "the bulk energy gap closes if a system is deformed adiabatically to a topologically nonequivalent system .",
    "remarkably , topological phase is not restricted to two and three dimensional systems .",
    "of special importance in the context of localization and topological phase in 1d is the aubry and andre ( aa ) model @xcite .",

    "topological equivalence between crystal and quasicrystal band structures @xcite and between the fibonacci quasicrystal and the harper model were shown @xcite .",
    "recently , the parameter range for a off - diagonal gapless aa model that can not be mapped onto a qh system was explored @xcite .",
    "+ the periodic table of topological insulators has been constructed only for hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "this is because of the fact that hermiticity was required in quantum mechanics to guarantee the reality of the spectrum .",
    "however , it was shown in 1998 that hermiticity requirement is replaced by the analogous condition of @xmath0 symmetry , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 operators are parity and time reversal operators , respectively @xcite . in 2010 ,",
    "a non - hermitian system was experimentally realized in an optical system @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a @xmath0 symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian admits real spectrum as long as non - hermitian degree is below than a critical number .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises .",
    "does there exist a topologically nontrivial system described by non - hermitian hamiltonian ?",
    "this problem was considered by some authors @xcite .",
    "hu and hughes @xcite and esaki et al . @xcite studied non - hermitian generalization of topologically insulating phase at almost the same time .",
    "the main finding of these papers is that topological states do nt exist in the @xmath0 symmetric region because of the existence of complex energy eigenvalues . in @xcite",
    ", they considered dirac - type hamiltonians and concluded that the appearance of the complex eigenvalues is an indication of the non - existence of the topological insulator phase in non - hermitian models .",
    "they discussed that finding non - hermitian topological phases without dirac - type hamiltonians could be possible .",
    "esaki et al .",
    "considered tight binding honeycomb lattice with imaginary onsite potentials and non - hermitian generalizations of the luttinger hamiltonian and kane - mele model @xcite .",
    "they found that the zero energy edge states are robust against small non - hermitian perturbation , while these states decay because of the imaginary part of eigenvalues . in 2012 , ghosh studied topological phase in some non - hermitian system by changing the metric of the hilbert space i.e. modifying the inner product @xcite .",
    "schomerus considered a one dimensional non - hermitian tight binding lattice with staggered tunneling amplitude and showed that the system admits complex spectrum @xcite .",
    "another attempt has recently been made to find non - hermitian hamiltonian admitting topological insulator phase @xcite .",
    "zhu , lu and chen specifically considered non - hermitian su - schrieffer - heeger model with two conjugated imaginary potential located at the edges of the system @xcite .",
    "they found that zero energy modes are unstable and corresponding energy eigenvalues are not real in the topologically nontrivial region .",
    "in all of these papers , no example of topological edge states for a non - hermitian system with a real spectrum has been found .",
    "the existence of topological phase transition for @xmath0 symmetric non - hermitian systems is still an important question . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a non - hermitian generalization of the off - diagonal aubry andre model .",
    "in contrast to general belief , we find topological edge states in the @xmath0 symmetric region , i.e. topological edge states with real spectrum .",
    "this is the first example in the literature where topological states are compatible with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we consider tight binding description of a @xmath0 symmetric lattice @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the 1d off - diagonal aa model .",
    "this is a 1d tight binding model with modulated tunneling parameter .",
    "in addition , suppose two non - hermitian impurities are inserted in the system .",
    "the impurities are balanced gain and loss materials .",
    "we require that the non - hermitian impurities are arranged at symmetrical sites with respect to the center of the lattice , i.e. , particles are injected on the @xmath3-th site and removed from the @xmath4-th site , where @xmath5 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where the parameter @xmath7 represents non - hermitian degree , @xmath8 is unmodulated tunneling amplitude , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the creation and annihilation operators of fermionic particles on site @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian is the kinetic energy from the nearest - neighbor tunneling and the last term is the non - hermitian potential due to two non - hermitian impurities .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is the strength of the modulation and @xmath13 controls the periodicity of the modulation .",
    "the modulation is periodical if @xmath13 is rational and quasi - periodical if it is irrational .",
    "as it is usual on the topic of topological insulator in 1d , the modulation phase @xmath14 is an additional degree of freedom .",
    "+ below , we will find energy spectrum of this hamiltonian numerically .",
    "we adopt open boundary conditions with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the two edge sites .",
    "note that the translational invariance of the system is broken for open boundary conditions . before going into the details ,",
    "let us study the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian qualitatively .",
    "it is clear that the system has no parity symmetry when the tunneling is modulated quasi - periodically .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian is not @xmath0 symmetric when @xmath13 is irrational .",
    "consider now periodical modulation of tunneling . for finite number of @xmath17",
    ", the particles on the two ends of the chain may not have the same tunneling to their nearest neighbors .",
    "furthermore , particles injected on site @xmath18 and to be lost from site @xmath19 may feel different tunneling depending on @xmath13 and @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we say that the system with edges does nt generally possess global @xmath0 symmetry in the usual sense .",
    "for example , for @xmath20 , the system is invariant under usual @xmath0 operation when @xmath21 but not when @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    ", we say that topological zero energy states exist when @xmath66 is even and we show that the corresponding spectrum becomes real under certain conditions . + it is worthwhile to point out that the topological phase in the unbroken @xmath0 symmetric phase can be broken by the next - nearest - neighbor tunneling .",
