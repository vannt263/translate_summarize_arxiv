    "during the last decade the remarkable experimental improvements in the field of ultracold atoms renewed the interest in studying non - equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many - body systems  @xcite . among the latter , one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems are an ideal playground to explore the interplay between non - equilibrium and interaction effects .",
    "indeed , from the theoretical point of view , the study of out - of - equilibrium 1d systems can benefit from the generalization of tools developed to investigate their equilibrium properties to the non - equilibrium regime .",
    "in particular , the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model  @xcite , which describes the equilibrium low energy sector of any 1d gapless system including the main effects of inter - particle interactions , proved to be very powerful also in exploring out - of - equilibrium properties . in particular , it allowed for a better understanding of many general features of non - equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "for instance , sudden interaction quenches in lls provided the first analytical results about the issue of thermalization in quantum integrable systems  @xcite and showed very neat signatures of the `` light - cone '' ( lc ) effect in correlations functions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore they allowed to determine how transport and spectral properties are modified far from equilibrium  @xcite and to investigate the crossover from sudden to adiabatic quenches  @xcite .",
    "finally , the possibility of addressing also open boundary conditions  @xcite enabled to study effects of quantum quench in finite - size 1d systems  @xcite . in the latter case , when a 1d fermionic system is confined in a small region of space ,",
    "marked oscillations appear in the particle density .",
    "in particular , _ friedel _ oscillations , due to reflections at the system edges , exist regardless of the interactions between fermions and give rise to @xmath0 peaks in the particle density ( with @xmath1 the number of fermions in the system , assumed even for simplicity , and @xmath2 the single - particle levels degeneracy )  @xcite . on the other hand inter - particle interactions , for example by means of a small umklapp term in the hamiltonian of system ,",
    "could lead to the formation of a wigner molecule  @xcite  the finite - size counterpart of the wigner crystal  @xcite  characterized by @xmath1 peaks in the particle density , regardless of @xmath2 . in a previous work  @xcite",
    "the authors studied the density dynamics of a spinless ll after a quantum quench of the inter - particle interaction with finite time duration showing that it exhibits a sharp lc behavior . in this system @xmath3 and",
    "thus friedel and wigner oscillations possess the same number of peaks  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize our previous results to the spinful case ( with @xmath4 ) , where a competition between @xmath5 peaks of friedel oscillations and @xmath1 peaks of wigner ones is expected in the particle density , focusing on both a sudden and an adiabatic turning on of a repulsive inter - particle interaction .",
    "since a possible umklapp term in the hamiltonian  which in the equilibrium is responsible for the emergence of wigner oscillations  strongly depends on the strength of inter - particle interactions  @xcite , the quench should also affects its structure and the associated wigner contribution to the density .",
    "consequently , we also consider a simultaneous quench of the umklapp term in the system hamiltonian obtaining an overall enhancement of the lc effect already found in the spinless case  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the formation of a wigner molecule is conveyed by the propagation of lc perturbations through the system and is deeply affected by the time duration of the quench .",
    "in particular , in the sudden case two lc perturbations emerge from the boundaries of the system immediately after the quench and make the particle density oscillate periodically in time between the non - interacting profile , with friedel oscillations only , and the correlated one , with a wigner molecule clearly visible inside the system .",
    "this periodic behavior is due to the finite size of the system , which results in a finite recurrence time and implies that the latter will never reach a steady state  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to create a stable wigner molecule , one should resort to a slower quenching protocol . in this case  and for strong enough inter - particle interactions  two lc perturbations emerge at the beginning of the quench and , after each subsequent passage , contribute to broaden and to split every initial friedel peak into two well separated wigner peaks .",
    "after a long enough quench a wigner molecule has thus stabilized inside the system while non - equilibrium effects survives as two different lc perturbations that make the particle density weakly oscillate above the wigner molecule configuration : the first ones are the continuation of the lc perturbations emerged at the beginning of the quenching protocol while the second ones arise from the boundaries when the quench stops .",
