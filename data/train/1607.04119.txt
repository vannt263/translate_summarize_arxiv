    "ultracold spinor bose gases provide a beautiful example to study fragmented bose - einstein condensates ( bec )  @xcite , where bose - einstein condensation occurs in two or more single particle states simultaneously .",
    "this is an unusual scenario , in contrast with conventional bose - einstein condensation where bosons cluster together into a single state . for single - component bosons , condensation in a single state",
    "is enforced by repulsive interactions : the energetic cost of fragmentation is too high because of the associated exchange energy  @xcite .    for bosons with an internal degree of freedom",
    ", one can escape this mechanism by building correlations between the particles to cancel the exchange energy  @xcite .",
    "a spin-1 bec with antiferromagnetic interactions in a tight trap has been predicted to host such fragmented condensates for vanishing magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the atoms condense into a single spatial mode but there remains a large internal degeneracy at the single - particle level .",
    "antiferromagnetic interactions lift this degeneracy , and lead to a total spin - singlet ground state which is completely fragmented between the three sublevels .",
    "the many - body singlet state displays strong quantum correlations , and has attracted much theoretical interest .",
    "this spin - singlet fragmented condensate is fragile against any perturbation lifting the single - particle degeneracy , such as external magnetic fields  @xcite . in experiments with alkali atoms ,",
    "the most relevant perturbation is the quadratic zeeman splitting between the zeeman sublevels @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite . for finite atom number @xmath2",
    ", there is a small but non - vanishing window where the singlet state survives as the quadratic zeeman splitting increases from zero , before a crossover to a single @xmath0 condensate takes place ( `` single bec domain '' )  @xcite .",
    "an appropriate witness of the transition is the variance @xmath3 which goes from @xmath4 in the spin - singlet state to @xmath5 in an uncorrelated many - body state  @xcite .    because of the sensitivity to external perturbations ,",
    "the singlet state has so far eluded experimental observation .",
    "the gap to the first excited states is low and scales as the inverse of the number of atoms  @xcite .",
    "evaporative cooling used to produce quantum gases is unable to reach such ultralow temperatures .",
    "another procedure is to adiabatically produce the singlet state by first applying a magnetic field and condensing in the @xmath0 state , and then slowly remove the field to produce the desired singlet state  see the sketch in fig .  [",
    "fig : rampq ] . in order to stay adiabatic",
    ", the dynamics must be very slow in view of the small energy scales involved , making the procedure vulnerable to heating or inelastic losses .    in this article",
    "we introduce a way to shortcut the adiabatic following and thus produce the desired final state in times much shorter than those needed in adiabatic processes .",
    "such methods have been recently derived for a number of quantum mechanical systems  see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , and promise to provide important advances in actual implementations of quantum technologies , for instance trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "exact protocols have been derived for particular problems , e.g. the quantum harmonic oscillator  @xcite . in other cases , approximate procedures , obtained by adapting exact ones ,",
    "have been proven to be quite promising when applied to quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "as will be shown , the approximate shortcut protocol will be obtained from a large @xmath2 limit of the quantum many - body system .",
    "this limit will allow us to map our original many - spin problem into an effective harmonic oscillator , for which an exact solution is available  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , very recently a similar harmonic description of a spinor bec has allowed the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite to prove parametric amplification of a spinor system .",
    "this work proves experimentally the appropriateness of the harmonic description .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we present the theoretical model to describe the spinor bec and discuss the adiabatic preparation of the ground state . in section  [ sec : sa ] we obtain our protocol to shortcut the adiabatic evolution in the spinor system from a continuum approximation to the spin dynamics . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we apply our shortcut protocol to the bec regime ( dominated by the quadratic zeeman energy ) . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we consider a broader range of parameters , discussing the quality of our protocol to produce fragmented bec starting from the bec side .",
    "in section  [ sec5 ] we present results making use of current experimental setups  @xcite . in section  [ sec6 ] ,",
    "we briefly summarize our work and present the main conclusions .",
    "with all atoms in the @xmath0 state . in this regime ,",
    "the initial state is very close to the ground state ( arbitrarily close as @xmath6 ) . in the adiabatic method ,",
    "the qze is slowly reduced in such a way that the state of the system remains always close to the instantaneous ground state . stopping the qze ramp at @xmath7 ,",
    "the system ends up in a total spin - singlet ground state with strong spin correlations . stopping the ramp at a large , negative value of @xmath8",
    ", we prepare instead a twin fock state with half the atoms in the zeeman @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we target the production of the singlet state , and examine this procedure and alternative ramps which are not adiabatic but result in a state close to the ground state in a much faster time .",
    "[ fig : rampq ] ]",
    "we consider an ultracold gas of spin-1 bosons in a harmonic trap under the action of an external magnetic field .",
    "we assume a single spatial mode in the trap , that is , all bosons condense in the same spatial orbit irrespective of their internal state . with this assumption",
    "we are left with three single - particle states , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , corresponding to the zeeman states with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the linear zeeman effect acts only as a shift in the energy and does not contribute to determine the equilibrium state .",
    "the main contribution of the magnetic field is the quadratic , or second order , zeeman ( qz ) effect  @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "the system is well described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spin interaction energy per atom , @xmath2 is the number of atoms , @xmath16 is the ( dimensionless ) total spin operator , @xmath8 is the quadratic zeeman energy and @xmath17 is the number operator of the zeeman state @xmath18 .    the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) describes antiferromagnetic interactions between pairs of atoms , and favours configurations with low total spin @xmath19 . in absence of the quadratic zeeman term , @xmath7 ,",
    "the eigenstates are known analytically and are given by the total spin eigenstates @xmath20 , where @xmath19 is the total spin and @xmath21 the eigenvalue of @xmath22 , the projection of the total spin on the @xmath23 axis .",
    "this is the basis we will be using in the following sections .",
    "low-@xmath19 configurations are obtained by putting many spin-1 atoms to form singlet state pairs , while the remaining atoms can occupy any zeeman sublevel . for practical convenience , from now on @xmath2",
    "will be set to an even number .",
    "the ground state for even @xmath2 is the total spin singlet @xmath24 .",
    "this highly fragmented state , termed `` spin - singlet condensate '' ( ssc ) , takes the form of a condensate of delocalized spin - singlet pairs , @xmath25 where @xmath26 creates a pair of atoms in the two - particle singlet state , @xmath27 is an annihilation operator for a particle in the zeeman state with third component of the angular momentum equal to @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the boson vacuum .",
    "this fragmented state is characterized by three macroscopically populated states , @xmath30 , with large fluctuations of the individual components  @xcite .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) describes the interaction of the system with the external magnetic field . in the non - interacting limit @xmath31 and for @xmath32 ,",
    "the qze forces all the spins to occupy the state @xmath0 , thus forming a single bose - einstein condensate with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the so - called @xmath23-polar state , @xmath35    it is worth noting that @xmath21 remains fixed when changing @xmath8 , because the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath22 .",
    "this is a good approximation to the behavior due to the experimental conditions of the atomic quantum gases , which are highly isolated from the environment , and to the microscopic rotational invariance of the spin exchange interaction  @xcite .    for simplicity , we take @xmath36 .",
    "also , as the number of particles @xmath2 is fixed during the evolution , we will omit it on the kets , thus , for now on we will use the notation @xmath37 .      for generic values of @xmath39",
    ", we write a general state @xmath40 with fixed @xmath2 and @xmath36 as @xmath41 .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath42 in the @xmath19 basis reduces to the following discrete eigenvalue equation ( see appendix  [ app : a ] ) , @xmath43    in the upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : cx ] we show the transition from the @xmath44-dominated fragmented regime to the single bec regime when varying the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes takes place at values @xmath46 and is seen in the behavior of the variance @xmath47 of the populations in the @xmath0 zeeman state . as explained in the introduction in the uncorrelated bec state ,",
    "@xmath48 , while in the spin - singlet state the fluctuations are much larger , @xmath49 .      experimentally , the value of the qze can be controlled easily in real time .",
    "for instance , for sodium atoms with hyperfine spin @xmath50 in a magnetic field @xmath51 , the quadratic zeeman shift contributes a _ positive _ amount to @xmath8 .",
    "it is also possible to achieve @xmath52 by using the differential level shift induced on the individual zeeman sublevels by a far off - resonant microwave field ( see  @xcite for details ) . with a suitable choice of the microwave polarization , detuning and power ,",
    "the sign and magnitude of @xmath8 can be changed at will .",
    "this experimental control of the qze opens a way to the generation of strongly correlated states in spin-1 quantum gases .",
    "the principle is the following . for zero magnetization and a large and positive qze ,",
    "the ground state is very close to a single bec with all atoms in the @xmath0 zeeman state .",
    "a good approximation of this state can be prepared `` by hand '' , _",
    "e.g. _ by applying radio - frequency rf pulses with suitable frequency and polarization to a spin - polarized ensemble in @xmath53 , for instance .",
    "starting from this initial state and decreasing slowly the value of @xmath8 , the system will adiabatically follow its ground state , and end up prepared in the ssc state given in eq .",
    "( [ ssc ] ) when @xmath54 .    we can estimate the speed at which the magnetic field should be decreased by the usual adiabatic criterion , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are two eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the dangerous region is around @xmath58 , where the energy gap to the first excited state takes its minimum value @xmath59 . in this region ,",
    "the qze ramp has to be very slow .",
    "we make a crude estimate by assuming that @xmath8 decreases between @xmath44 and @xmath60 in a time @xmath61 .",

    "this leads to @xmath64 and to the adiabaticity criterion , @xmath65 the catastrophic scaling @xmath66 shows that this method will be limited to small , mesoscopic samples . using very long ramp times to fulfill the adiabaticity criterion will make the protocol vulnerable to experimental limitations not captured by the single - mode hamiltonian , such as technical heating ( specific for each experimental setup ) and inelastic losses ( specific for each atom ) .    inelastic atom losses destroy the rotational symmetry since atoms are lost at random from any zeeman state . a common source of inelastic losses is three - body recombination into a weakly - bound molecule and a fast atom , resulting in three atoms lost from the trap . the total rate of these events can be written as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is determined by a species - dependent rate constant @xmath69 and by the spatial density @xmath70 .",
    "demanding less than one single inelastic event ( on average ) during the entire adiabatic protocol gives a bound @xmath71 .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we consider a gas of atoms condensing in the gaussian ground state of a tight harmonic trap of frequency @xmath72 .",
    "the gaussian ground state of the trap is a good approximation of the actual condensate wavefunction for sufficiently low atom number @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the harmonic oscillator length , with @xmath75 the atomic mass and with @xmath76 the spin - independent @xmath77wave scattering length .",
    "the spin - dependent scattering length @xmath78 is determined by the relation @xmath79",
    "the bound @xmath71 can be written as a bound on the maximum affordable atom number in trap , written in compact form as @xmath80 where @xmath81 has the dimension of a length .",
    "we specialize to the case of @xmath50 sodium atoms , where @xmath82 nm and @xmath83 nm @xcite and three - body loss rate constant @xmath84at.@xmath85/s  @xcite . using @xmath86khz",
    ", one finds @xmath87 for the parameters given above , showing that the adiabatic approach is reserved for mesoscopic samples containing only a few atoms .",
    "this motivates us to find alternative solutions enabling a substantial speed - up of the dynamics , which is our main objective in the rest of this paper .",
    "in view of the limitations of the adiabatic approach described above , we now examine a different method where the same final result can be reached in a much shorter time . in the literature , there are well - established shortcut protocols for one - body harmonic potentials  @xcite . our strategy is to use these results to manipulate the many - spin system of interest by mapping it to an effective harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "we show in this section how a reasonable harmonic approximation to the many - body problem can be derived . by means of such approximate equation",
    "we map the shortcut protocol to the exact time dependent schrdinger equation built from eq .",

    "( [ eq : en ] ) for different values of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath100 , the system becomes @xmath44-dominated and , thus , the energy is constant [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : en ] ) ] .",
    "it is worth noting that both in the fragmented ( @xmath44-dominated ) and bec ( @xmath8-dominated ) regimes , the approximate value of the energy agrees well with the exact one .",
    "lower panel : wave function of the ground state compared to the one obtained with the continuous approximation described in the text .",
    "the middle and lower panels are obtained for a system of @xmath101 spins . in all cases , @xmath102 hz . for the lower panel ,",

    "[ fig : cx ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cx ] we compare the approximated and the exact solutions of our hamiltonian . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cx ] we see that the energy of the ground state is well reproduced by the harmonic approximation .",
    "in particular it is interesting to note that the harmonic approximation works well both in the @xmath44-dominated regime and in the @xmath8-dominated one . comparing the actual wave functions in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cx ] , we can see that the solution of the approximate hamiltonian has a similar shape as the exact wave function although its maximum is slightly displaced towards higher values of @xmath104 .",
    "the idea behind the shortcut to adiabaticity in the time - dependent evolution of an harmonic oscillator is the following .",
    "first we consider that the system is initially in the ground state for a certain initial value @xmath105 of the control parameter .",
    "then , we impose that at a given time @xmath106 the system must be exactly in the ground state for a different value of the control parameter , @xmath107 .",
    "the goal is , thus , to find a function @xmath108 that does the job .",
    "if the final time is sufficiently large , then any smooth ramp of the control parameter should work , since the evolution would be adiabatic . for short ramp times , an arbitrary ramp function would in general result in the excitation of many modes besides the ground state at the final time .",
    "the goal is therefore to engineer the ramp function in such a way as to minimize the excitations at @xmath109 and beyond , _ i.e. _ one seeks to produce an almost stationary state once the ramp is completed .",
    "the schrdinger - like equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham3 ] ) is already close to the one corresponding to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the control parameter is the qze , @xmath110 .",
    "the term on the right - hand side ( a shift in the total energy ) does not have any effect on the dynamics .",
    "we also limit ourselves to the regime @xmath111 .",
    "the final schrdinger - like equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham3 ] ) is that of a harmonic oscillator with time - dependent `` mass '' and frequency @xmath112 .",
    "a similar equation was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the dynamics of a two - mode bose - hubbard model .",
    "following the same method , we look for a self - similar solution @xmath113 , with a scaling parameter @xmath114 .",
    "such a solution exists if the scaling parameter obeys the so - called ermakov equation  @xcite , @xmath115 the constant @xmath116 is just an integration constant that we set to @xmath117 .",
    "this , together with the substitution @xmath118 gives @xmath119 @xmath120 is an arbitrary function that only has to satisfy the frictionless conditions @xmath121 where @xmath122 will always be zero . there is an infinite set of functions @xmath120 that can be used for this purpose , as the boundary conditions provide ample freedom to choose @xmath120 .",
    "here we will use a simple polynomial ansatz , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath108 is @xmath125 the six frictionless conditions previously mentioned uniquely determine the fifth - order polynomial chosen .",
    "we have tested that using a sixth - order polynomial or power - law functions did not improve the results , hence eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) is used in the rest of this work .",
    "let us remark that the freedom in choosing @xmath120 can be used to design more constrained protocols depending on the specific needs , e.g. avoiding too large values of @xmath108 .",
    "in this section , we consider the performance of our shortcut protocol in the bec regime .",
    "that is , our main goal is to evolve from the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) for an initial value of @xmath126 to the corresponding ground state for @xmath107 such that @xmath127 . strictly speaking , the choice @xmath128 does not comply with the assumption used to derive the protocol , @xmath129 .",
    "the reason why the protocol can be extended to this situation is that for short times @xmath130 , the protocol produces a very small variation of @xmath8 , and the dynamics thus remains mostly adiabatic .    to judge the quality of the shortcut protocol we will compare it to two other ramps shapes , linear and exponential , @xmath131 the linear ramp is uniquely determined , and the exponential ramp was found to provide the best results for a decay constant @xmath132 , a value we have used in all the reported results .",
    "we benchmark our shortcut protocol by numerically solving the full time dependent schrdinger equation with @xmath133 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) for a particular ramp .",
    "we used the mean - squared spin @xmath134 as a fidelity witness . note that in the regime we consider in this section , the target final value of @xmath135 is far above the value @xmath136 below which the ground state reduces to the total spin singlet state . as a result",

    "moreover , the final value of @xmath148 decreases with increasing atom number at a fixed @xmath106 .",
    "equivalently , the final fidelities obtained with the shortcut protocol improve as we increase @xmath2 .",
    "this could be expected as we have obtained our protocol in the large @xmath2 limit , thus making the protocol closer to an exact description as @xmath2 is increased .",

    "this can be seen comparing panels ( a , c ) , computed with @xmath155 with panels ( b , d ) , computed with @xmath156 .",
    "finally , note that even though the shortcut performs quite well , the final wave function is peaked at @xmath154 rather than at @xmath153 , which reflects the fact that we are still on the single bec side of the crossover reported in fig .",

    "taking these parameters , we have calculated the evolution of a system with @xmath188 particles and @xmath186 hz to check whether the shortcut protocol still gives good results under these experimental conditions .",
    "results have also been obtained for a system with @xmath181 spins using the shortcut protocol for the approximate hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham3 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] both results are shown for comparison .",
    "@xmath148 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] , has been computed for these two systems and , although the initial values of @xmath108 are larger than @xmath44 , the shortcut protocol still drives the system to the ground state ( or close ) and improves the performance of the other two ramps . although the shortcut protocol is , in principle , only valid for @xmath184 , this and other calculations ( where we have driven a system from different values of @xmath189 , all between 10 and 1000 times larger that @xmath44 , to @xmath135 above and below @xmath44 ) show that the protocol can be successfully applied for larger @xmath189 values .",
    "we have presented a method to prepare a spin-1 bec into a many - body spin singlet state by making use of an approximate protocol to shortcut the adiabatic following in the many - body system .",
    "the protocol consists in specific functions @xmath108 which are constructed such that the time evolution of the system brings the many - body state from the ground state for @xmath190 to the ground state for @xmath191 .",
    "the main aim is to produce the very fragmented ground state of the spinor system in absence of quadratic magnetic field , starting from a condensate in the @xmath0 manifold in a regime dominated by the quadratic zeeman term .",
    "the performance of the shortcut protocol has been compared to both a linear and an exponential ramp of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "even though the protocol is only approximate , it is shown to provide a much better performance than the exponential and linear ones almost in all situations . in the bec side , that is , for @xmath192 , the method works almost perfectly for time intervals of the order of @xmath193 and larger .",
    "the method works also better for cases in which the bec - fragmented transition is targeted .",
    "in particular it works with similar accuracy as the exponential ramp up to times one order of magnitude smaller . to quantify the performance we have computed the achieved final value of @xmath134 and the value of @xmath194 .",
    "we have obtained results for systems with different sizes and final and initial setups and we have seen that the protocol achieves better results for larger systems .",
    "results have also been obtained from approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation [ using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham3 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cx ] ) ] . based on these results",
    "we have been able to extrapolate the method to larger systems and find that , with this protocol , a many - body spin singlet state can be obtained for many different systems sizes .",
    "we have also shown the success of our method when applied to systems prepared with parameters taken from current experimental setups .",
    "we believe that our method for preparing a bec into a singlet state with short times is experimentally realizable and efficient .",
    "further improvements to the shortcut protocol profiting from the available freedom inherent to the presented procedure will be the object of forthcoming investigations .",
