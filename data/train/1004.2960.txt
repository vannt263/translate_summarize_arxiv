    "early - type galaxies have a hot , x - ray emitting interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is considered to be gravitationally confined ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations of the metal abundances in the ism of early - type galaxies provide a key to understanding the history of star formation and the evolution of galaxies , because the metals in the ism come from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and stellar mass loss .",
    "a lot of observational evidence suggests that a significant fraction of present early - type galaxies have transformed from late - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from z@xmath00.5 ,",
    "the fraction of s0 galaxies in clusters of galaxies has increased , whereas , that of spirals has decreased , with no evolution in the fraction of ellipticals @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that these changes appear more strongly in less massive clusters with lower velocity dispersion .",
    "these results suggest that spiral galaxies changed into s0 galaxies at z@xmath10.5 , falling into clusters of galaxies .",
    "the metallicity of stars in galaxies reflects in the star formation history , therefore , it is an important parameter for understanding the evolution of galaxies .",
    "optical observations indicate that mg / fe and @xmath2/fe ratios of stars are super - solar in the cores of bright early - type galaxies and increases with galactic mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this overabundance of mg relative to fe is the key indicator that galaxy formation occurred before a substantial number of sne ia could explode and contribute to lowering the these ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , absorption - line indices that account for abundance ratios also depend on the age distribution of stars .",
    "optical spectroscopy is limited within the very center of galaxies .    using x - ray observations",
    ", we can directly determine the metal abundances of the ism , and constrain the stellar metallicity of the entire galaxy .",
    "the atomic data for lines at x - ray wavelengths are simpler than for those in optical spectra , and the structure of the hot ism is also much simpler than stellar population data .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the temperature and metallicity of the hot ism through x - ray spectra with small systematic uncertainties .",
    "xmm - newton epic and rgs provided the means to measure o and mg abundances in some systems , but reliable results have been obtained only for several central galaxies in groups and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ism in such regions might be polluted by the gas of clusters or groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    with the suzaku x - ray satellite , o , ne , and mg abundances of four elliptical galaxies , ngc 720 @xcite , ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 @xcite , and ngc 4636 @xcite ,",
    "have been measured .",
    "the xis detector onboard suzaku @xcite can constrain o , ne , and mg abundances well because its energy resolution is better , and its background is lower than any previous x - ray ccd detector @xcite . according to the new solar abundance table of @xcite ,",
    "the abundance ratios of these elliptical galaxies are close to the solar values . assuming the sn ii abundance pattern of @xcite , about 80% of fe is synthesized by sne ia @xcite .",
    "the abundance pattern of the hot ism in s0 galaxies observed with suzaku has not been reported . in this paper , we present the temperature and abundances of o , ne , mg , and fe in the ism within 4  @xmath3 of the s0 galaxy ngc 4382 , observed with suzaku . here",

    "the distance to ngc 4382 is 16.8 mpc @xcite , and its redshift , z=0.002432 , is taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "ngc 4382 is located in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , 1.7 mpc from cd galaxy m87 .",
    "the central stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy , 179 km s@xmath4 and its @xmath5 $ ] value , @xmath6 @xcite , are much smaller than those of the four elliptical galaxies , observed with suzaku .",
    "these values were derived only within two arcsec of the center of ngc 4382 , and we do not know the metallicity of stars outside of the central region . so far , ngc 4382 has been observed with rosat @xcite , asca @xcite , chandra @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "these x - ray observations suggest that the temperature of the ism in ngc 4382 is about 0.30.4 kev , which is much lower than those of the four early - type galaxies observed with suzaku . since no the intracluster medium ( icm ) around ngc 4382 has been detected , this galaxy is suitable for investigating heavy elements in the ism of the galaxy itself .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a hubble constant of @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "we adopt the new solar abundance table of @xcite .",

    "we processed the xis data with xispi , using the calibration files distributed on 04 - 03 - 2009 .",
    "then , we cleaned the xis data by assuming thresholds of @xmath13 on the earth elevation angle , and @xmath14 on the day - earth elevation angle .",
    "the total exposure time for both fi and bi sensors amounts to @xmath099 ksec after standard data screening .",
    "event screening with cut - off rigidity ( cor ) was not performed on our data .",
    "xis response files were calculated using the xisrmfgen response matrix file ( rmf ) generator @xcite , version 02 - 28 - 2009 .",

    "we note that arf files assuming a point - source , a @xmath15-model profile , or flat - sky are almost the same within the energy range of 0.4 to 5 kev , except for normalization .",
    "slight degradation of the energy resolution was considered in the rmf , and a decrease in the low - energy transmission of the xis optical blocking filter ( obf ) was included in the arfs . to subtract the contribution of non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , we used xisnxbgen , which generates the nxb spectrum from a dark earth database @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : ximg ] , we extracted the spectra within a 4  @xmath3 circle centered on the optical center of ngc 4382 from ned .",
    "we also used the region outside 5  @xmath3 to estimate the background . northwest of ngc 4382 ,",
    "a point - like x - ray source was detected at 0.32.0kev .",
    "we excluded this source from each spectrum .",
    "we used the spectra from the bi ( xis1 ) and fi ( xis0 and 3 ) sensors for the energy ranges of 0.45.0 kev and 0.65.0 kev , respectively , since subtracting background lines is difficult above 5.0 kev , and the ism does not emit photons above 5.0 kev .",
    "the energy range around the si k - edge ( 1.821.84 kev ) was ignored as a result of a problem in the response matrix .",
    "the remaining total photon counts with xis0 , 1 , and 3 are 3490 , 6604 , and 3617 counts , respectively .",
    "although two calibration sources emitting strong lines above 5 kev are located at the corners of each xis , spectral analysis is not affected below 5 kev .",
    "therefore , we included these regions , and analyzed the spectra below 5 kev .",
    "the spectra of xis detectors ( xis0 , 1 , and 3 ) were fitted simultaneously with a model consisting of the ism emission , unresolved discrete sources , cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and galactic components . here , the spectra of the nxb were subtracted .",
    "we adopted a single - temperature vapec model @xcite as the ism thin thermal emission component ( hereafter , the 1 t model ) .",
    "the ism in early - type galaxies originates mainly from stellar mass loss , and most of the metals in these stars are the products of sne .",
    "the metal abundances of he , c , n , and al were fixed at solar values .",
    "we organized the abundances of other heavy elements into five groups : o ; ne ; mg ; the si group ( si , s , ar , and ca ) ; and the fe group ( fe and ni ) , and allowed them to vary . this is because significant detections of the ionized o , ne , mg , si , and fe lines are expected . in this study",

    "the power - law model described the total spectra of discrete sources in early - type galaxies well , and was successfully used for this role in previous studies @xcite .",

    "galactic emission arises mainly from the local hot bubble ( lhb ) and the milky way halo ( mwh ) .",

    "the ism abundance ratios of ngc 4382 and the elliptical galaxies are located between those of sne ia and sne ii .",
    "this means that the metals in the ism are a mixture of sne ia and sne ii yields .",
    "since o is predominantly synthesized by sne ii , the observed lower o / fe ratio in the ism of ngc 4382 indicates larger contributions from sne ia to the ism in this s0 galaxy than in elliptical galaxies . in early - type galaxies ,",
    "the ism comes from stellar mass loss and is polluted by present sne ia . to explain the low o / fe ratio in ngc 4382 , the present sn",
    "ia rate may differ between ngc 4382 and elliptical galaxies , or stars in this galaxy may contain more sne ia products than those in elliptical galaxies .",
    "assuming that the fe abundance in the ism is mainly the sum of stellar metallicity and the contribution from sne ia , it can be expressed as @xmath22 ( see @xcite for details ) . here , ( fe / h)@xmath23 is the stellar fe abundance synthesized by sne ia , @xmath24 is the sn ia rate , @xmath25 is the mass of fe synthesized by one sn ia , @xmath26 is the mass loss rate of stars , and @xmath27 is the fe metallicity of gas with the solar abundance .",

    "@xmath31 produced by one sn ia explosion is likely to be @xmath0 0.6@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "using the sn ia rate in early - type galaxies , which was estimated to be @xmath00.10.3 sn ia/100 yr/@xmath32 in previous studies @xcite , the present contribution of sne ia to the fe abundance in early - type galaxies becomes 2.98.7 solar .",

    "the derived sn ia rate of s0 galaxies , @xmath33 sn ia/100 yr/@xmath34 , tends to be higher than the @xmath35 sn ia/100yr/@xmath34 of elliptical galaxies .",

    "the fe abundances expected from the observed sn ia rate are higher than the fe abundances in the ism in the early - type galaxies observed with suzaku .",
    "this result indicates a low sn ia rate , although the absolute values of fe abundances have rather large errors owing to the elongated shape of the confidence contours .",
    "we note that a higher sn rate might be related to younger stellar age , in which case the stellar mass loss rate might also be higher .",
    "for example , assuming a stellar age of 10 gyr , the mass loss rate increases by 1.4 times , and the contribution of sne ia to the fe abundance decreases by 0.7 times .",
    "the other possibility is that the lower o / fe ratio of ngc 4382 may be because of a difference in the sn ia products included in stars in this and the elliptical galaxies .",
    "since a longer star - formation time scale yields more sn ia products in stars , the difference in o / fe ratio in stars can constrain the star - formation history .",
    "suzaku observes the ism of the entire galaxy and constrains the abundance pattern in stars of the entire galaxy , while optical observations are limited to the very center .",
    "optical observations found higher abundances of fe than of @xmath2-elements in stars in the central region ( within 2 arcsec ) of ngc 4382 ; @xmath5 = 0.12\\pm0.06 $ ] at the 1 @xmath36 confidence level @xcite .",
    "generally , giant elliptical galaxies have higher stellar abundances and higher @xmath38 ratios . for example , the @xmath5 $ ] of ngc 720 is @xmath39 within @xmath3/8 from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low o / fe ratio in the ism of ngc 4382 may reflect a lower @xmath5 $ ] in stars .",
    "xmm - newton and chandra observations show that about half of the photons from ngc 4832 within 8  @xmath3 are emitted from the region within 2  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that at least within a few @xmath3 the ism shows the low o / fe ratio .",
    "this region is much larger than that within 2 arcsec , to which the optical observations @xcite are limited . in other words , the suzaku observations provide evidence that not only the stars in the central region of ngc 4382 , but also those within at least a few @xmath3 have a smaller @xmath38 ratio than those of the four elliptical galaxies .",
    "a number of authors found a clear correlation between the @xmath2/fe ratio and system mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that galaxies with stellar velocity dispersion @xmath40 200 km @xmath9 have a relatively higher [ @xmath2/fe ] ( @xmath41 0.2 ) and also have higher metallicities .",
    "ngc 4382 has a lower ism temperature of @xmath00.3 kev , and its stellar velocity dispersion @xmath36 is 179@xmath426 km @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lower o / fe ratio in ngc 4382 may reflect a correlation with the system mass .",
    "usually , these metallicity and @xmath2/fe correlations with system mass are interpreted as showing that higher - mass systems have experienced more rapid star formation than lower - mass galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , most stars in larger systems would have formed before sne ia began to synthesize large amounts of fe .",
    "considering the fractional evolution of s0 and spiral galaxies in clusters , spiral galaxies might have changed into s0 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if so , stars in s0 galaxies would contain more sn ia products than those in elliptical galaxies , reflecting the fact that stars in spiral galaxies have lower @xmath5 $ ] ratios than those in giant ellipticals .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath5 $ ] of the sun is zero .",
    "if s0 galaxies in clusters generally have lower o / fe ratios in the ism , the hypothesis of morphology changes would be supported . to investigate further",
    ", we need more sample galaxies for which to derive abundance patterns in the ism using suzaku observations .",
    "with the suzaku observation of s0 galaxy ngc 4382 , we measured the ism temperature , metal abundances of o , ne , mg and fe , and their abundance ratios for the region within 4  @xmath3 of the galaxy s center .",

    "<S> since the hot ism in early - type galaxies is an accumulation of stellar mass and sn ia products , the low o / fe ratio in the ism of ngc 4382 reflects a higher rate of present sne ia , or stars containing more sn ia products than those in elliptical galaxies . </S>"
