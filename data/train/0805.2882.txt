    "control of quantum phenomena is becoming increasingly important in many divergent areas of research including quantum computation , quantum chemistry , nano - scale materials , and bose - einstein condensates .",
    "accordingly , quantum control theory has developed greatly in both depth and breath in recent years , and many results about controllability and control methods have been obtained .",
    "broadly speaking , quantum control approaches fall into two categories : open - loop hamiltonian ( and sometimes reservoir ) engineering using a variety of techniques including optimal control  @xcite and geometric designs  @xcite , and closed - loop quantum state reduction and stabilization using feedback from weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "lyapunov functions have played a significant role in control design .",
    "originally used in feedback control to analyze the stability of the controlled system , they have formed the basis for new control designs , and several recent papers have discussed the application of lyapunov control designs to quantum systems  . although the basic mathematical formalism is well established , using either the schrodinger equation for pure state wavefunctions  @xcite , or the liouville - von neumann equation  @xcite for density operators  , many questions remain .",
    "for example , some sufficient conditions for the method to be effective , i.e. , guarantee convergence of the system state converges to the target state , have been obtained  @xcite , but are they also necessary ?",
    "what are explicit requirements on the hamiltonian and the target state such that the control is effective ?    moreover , there are outstanding technical issues .",
    "the invariance principle  @xcite should be applied to autonomous systems , and its application for time - dependent target states needs careful justification . moreover , the trajectory of time - dependent target state under free evolution is generally not periodic , as previously asserted in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we address these issues and present a detailed analysis of the relationship between the effectiveness of lyapunov control design and the parameters in the control problem , the hamiltonian and the target state . in section",
    "ii , we establish the mathematical model for the quantum system controlled by lyapunov method , and apply lasalle invariance principle to analyze the convergence condition . in section iii and iv , we will use the results in section ii to discuss the lyapunov control of pseudo - pure state and generic state , under an ideal condition of the hamiltonian ; in section v , we shall relax this condition and see how the effectiveness of lyapunov control will change .",
    "a controlled quantum system can be modelled in different ways , either as a closed system evolving unitarily under certain hamiltonian , or as an open system interacting with a heat bath . in this paper , we restrict our discussion to an @xmath0-level bilinear hamiltonian dynamical system satisfying the liouville - von neumann equation : ( assuming @xmath1 ) : @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a positive trace - one operator , representing the system state , @xmath4 is the free evolution hamiltonian and @xmath5 is the controlled hamiltonian , both of which are constant . in the special case when the system is in a pure state @xmath6 , we have @xmath7 , and the dynamical system can be represented as : @xmath8 although we will use the density operator formulation throughout this paper .",
    "the general control task we consider can be formulated as , given a target state @xmath9 , we wish to apply a certain control field @xmath10 to the system that modifies its dynamics such that @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "since the free hamiltonian @xmath4 can generally not be turned off , it is natural to assume @xmath9 to be time - dependent , satisfying : @xmath13.\\ ] ] since the evolution of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 is unitary in our case , we require @xmath16 to be unitarily equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the state space @xmath18 is the set of all density operators @xmath3 such that @xmath3 and @xmath17 are unitarily equivalent .",
    "this is a compact manifold , called a flag manifold , whose dimension depends on the number of distinct eigenvalues of @xmath9 .",
    "we say @xmath9 is pseudo - pure if its spectrum has only two distinct values , one occurring with multiplicity one and the other with multiplicity @xmath19 , and @xmath9 is generic if it has @xmath0 non - degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "we have @xmath20 with @xmath21 for generic @xmath9 and @xmath22 for pure or pseudo - pure states .",
    "define a function @xmath23 on @xmath24 : @xmath25 we have @xmath26 with equality only if @xmath27 .",
    "taking derivative of @xmath23 along any solution @xmath28 , and substituting ( [ eqn:1 ] ) and ( [ eqn:3 ] ) , we derive : @xmath29\\rho)-\\tr(\\rho_d[-ih_0,\\rho])\\\\          & -f(t)\\tr(\\rho_d[-ih_1,\\rho])\\\\         = & -f(t)\\tr(\\rho_d[-ih_1,\\rho]).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath30)$ ] , @xmath31 , then @xmath32 .",
    "hence , @xmath23 is a lyapunov function for the following autonomous dynamical system with respect to @xmath28 : @xmath33\\\\    \\dot{\\rho}_d(t ) & = -i [ h_0 , \\rho_d(t ) ] \\\\",
    "f(\\rho,\\rho_d )   & = \\kappa \\tr([-ih_1,\\rho]\\rho_d ) \\end{split}\\ ] ]      to complete the control task , we require @xmath34 as @xmath35 , which is equivalent to @xmath36 . a key result for the convergence analysis is lasalle s invariance principle  @xcite :    [ thm:1 ] let @xmath37 be a lyapunov function on the phase space @xmath38 of an autonomous dynamical system @xmath39 , satisfying @xmath40 for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the orbit of @xmath44 in @xmath45 .",
    "then the invariant set @xmath46 , contains the positive limiting sets of all bounded solutions , i.e. , any bounded solution converges to @xmath47 as @xmath48 .    for our quantum dynamical system ( [ eqn : auto ] ) , since the state space @xmath49 is compact , any solution @xmath28 is bounded .",
    "applying lasalle invariance principle we obtain  @xcite :    the state @xmath28 of the autonomous dynamical system  ( [ eqn : auto ] ) converges to the invariant set @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the next step is to determine the invariant set @xmath47 , for the dynamical system  ( [ eqn : auto ] ) .",
    "notice that in lasalle invariance principle , @xmath47 contains the positive limiting points of all bounded solutions for any @xmath15 .",
    "hence , in the following , we always restrict the calculation of @xmath47 to the points @xmath51 such that @xmath52 is the positive limiting point of the given @xmath15 . for our dynamical system ,",
    "the invariant set @xmath53 is equivalent to @xmath54 , for any @xmath55 : @xmath56\\rho_d)\\\\ 0 & = \\dot f= \\tr([-ih_1,\\rho]\\dot \\rho_d)+\\tr([-ih_1,\\dot \\rho]\\rho_d)\\\\    & = -\\tr([[-ih_0,-ih_1],\\rho]\\rho_d)\\\\    & \\cdots \\\\ 0 & = \\frac{d^{\\ell}f}{dt^\\ell}=(-1)^n \\tr([{ad}^\\ell_{-ih_0}(-ih_1),\\rho]\\rho_d),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 represents @xmath58-fold commutator adjoint action of @xmath59 on @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath61c)=-\\tr([c , b]a)=-\\tr([a , c]b)$ ] gives a necessary condition for the invariant set @xmath47 : @xmath62\\ad^m_{-ih_0}(-ih_1))=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is any non - negative integer .",
    "hence the invariant @xmath47 depends on both the hamiltonian and the target state . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be trace - zero . since @xmath4 is hermitian and therefore diagonalizable",
    ", we may assume @xmath65 , with diagonal elements arranged in decreasing order , where the diagonal elements physically represent the energy levels of the system .",
    "we shall assume @xmath5 to be off - diagonal in this basis with off - diagonal elements @xmath66 representing the couplings between the energy levels @xmath67 and @xmath58 . also let @xmath68 be the transition frequency between the energy levels @xmath67 and @xmath58 . with these assumptions , we can prove the following useful theorem  @xcite :    [ thm : invariant ] if ( 1 ) @xmath4 strongly regular , i.e. , @xmath69 unless @xmath70 , and ( 2 ) @xmath5 fully connected , i.e. , @xmath71 except for @xmath72 , then @xmath51 belongs to the invariant set @xmath47 if and only if @xmath73 $ ] is diagonal .",
    "we note that these conditions on the hamiltonian are very strong and rarely satisfied for real physical systems .",
    "however , this is the ideal case for lyapunov control design , and it is useful to begin by analyzing the effectiveness of the method in this ideal case before relaxing the requirements .      in order to apply stability analysis to our complex quantum dynamical system , we require a real representation for both the hamiltonian and the density operator . let @xmath74 be the real vector space of all @xmath75 hermitian matrices on the hilbert space @xmath76 . for any @xmath77 , we can define an inner product @xmath78 , and an associated orthonormal basis @xmath79 , where    [ eq : lambda ] @xmath80    @xmath81 being the elementary matrix with @xmath82 in the @xmath83 position and @xmath84 elsewhere , and @xmath85 . in this basis , any hermitian matrix @xmath86 can be represented as an @xmath87-dimensional real vector . for density operators @xmath3 with @xmath88 the coefficient of @xmath89 is constant and thus can be dropped .",
    "let @xmath90 and @xmath91 be the vectors in @xmath92 representing @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the adjoint action @xmath93 $ ] in this basis is given by an anti - symmetric matrix @xmath94 acting on @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the quantum dynamical system  ( [ eqn : auto ] ) can be equivalently represented as : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this real representation is generally known as the bloch vector form especially for @xmath98 .",
    "in this section we consider ideal systems , i.e. , systems with @xmath4 strongly regular and @xmath5 fully connected .",
    "if the system and hence the hamiltonian are fixed , the invariant set @xmath47 depends on the target state @xmath9 only . in general , the convergence analysis depends on the spectrum of the target state @xmath9 , in particular the multiplicities of its eigenvalues . as we can not give a complete discussion of all possible cases here , we will focus on two cases of crucial importance , ( a ) when @xmath9 is a generic mixed state with @xmath0 non - degenerate eigenvalues , and ( b ) when @xmath9 is a pure or pseudo - pure state with only two eigenvalues with multiplicities @xmath82 and @xmath19 , respectively , starting with the two - level case .",
    "we start with the special case of a two - level system , for which the embedding of density operators into @xmath92 gives rise to a _ homeomorphism _ between density operators and points inside a closed ball in @xmath99 , with pure states forming the surface of the ball , and the completely mixed state @xmath100 its centre . in this case",
    "there is no distinction between pseudo - pure and generic states , all states except the completely mixed state @xmath101 being both generic and pseudo - pure .",
    "furthermore , the requirements of strong regularity of @xmath4 and full connectedness of @xmath5 are always satisfied for a two - level systems , except for the trivial cases of systems with a single degenerate state or no coupling to the control field .",
    "excluding these trivial cases , theorem  [ thm : invariant ] implies that all @xmath102 satisfy @xmath73 $ ] diagonal , and one can show that there are three types of points in the invariant set  @xcite    * @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 ; * @xmath105 ; * @xmath106 = \\tr[\\lambda_1\\rho_2]=0 $ ] .",
    "another special feature of the @xmath98 case is that for any choice of @xmath4 , the trajectory of @xmath15 forms a periodic orbit @xmath107 , which is a compact set , so any positive limiting point @xmath51 of @xmath28 must satisfy @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath17 has nonzero @xmath109 component , i.e. , @xmath110 then @xmath47 can only contain the cases ( a ) and ( b ) , corresponding to the values of lyapunov function @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "hence , for any @xmath14 with @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 and lasalle s invariance principle guarantees that @xmath36 and @xmath115 as @xmath12 . lyapunov control in this case is an effective strategy .",
    "if @xmath17 has zero @xmath109 component , however , then the invariant set @xmath47 contains all points @xmath116 satisfying ( c ) , the value of the lyapunov function @xmath23 on @xmath47 spans the entire interval @xmath117 $ ] , and we can not conclude that @xmath118 .",
    "indeed simulations suggest that @xmath23 can tend to any value in @xmath117 $ ] in this case .",
    "we can still conclude that @xmath14 converges to the set @xmath119 corresponding to the orbit of @xmath15 but this is a substantially weaker notion of convergence as there are infinitely many distinct states whose orbits under free evolution coincide .",
    "if we take the bloch vector to be @xmath120 with @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as usual for @xmath98 , then case ( a ) corresponds to @xmath124 , case ( b ) corresponds to @xmath125 being antipodal to @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and ( c ) corresponds to the target state lying on the equator of the sphere . if @xmath128 is not on the equator , all solutions @xmath90 with @xmath129 converge to @xmath91 . if @xmath128 is on the equator , any solution @xmath90 will converge to the equator but @xmath130 in general .",
    "the picture is the same for all equivalence classes of states , except the completely mixed state , the only difference being that pure states lie on the surface of the ball , while pseudo - pure states with the same spectrum lie on concentric spherical shells of in the interior .    for @xmath131 pseudo - pure states are exceptional or non - generic and",
    "the mapping from density operators into @xmath92 provided by the bloch vector is only an embedding , not a homeomorphism .",
    "furthermore , the conditions on the hamiltonian of strong regularity and complete connectedness are less trivial in this case as there are many systems that are connected and regular and controllable , but not strongly regular or fully connected . however , assuming such ideal hamiltonians we can still prove  @xcite :    [ thm : conv : ideal - pseudo - pure ] given a pseudo - pure state target state @xmath15 with spectrum @xmath132 and ideal hamiltonians as defined above , lyapunov control is effective , i.e. , any solution @xmath14 with @xmath114 will converge to @xmath15 as @xmath12 , _ except _ when @xmath9 has a single pair of non - zero off - diagonal entries of the form @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in the latter case any solution @xmath14 will converge to the orbit of @xmath15 but in general @xmath135 as @xmath35 and @xmath136 can take any limiting value between @xmath84 and @xmath137 .",
    "this theorem essentially asserts that if @xmath4 is strongly regular , @xmath5 is fully connected and @xmath9 is a pseudo - pure state whose dynamics is not confined to a periodic orbit in a two - dimensional subspace , then any solution @xmath14 with @xmath138 will converge to @xmath15 as @xmath12 .",
    "thus for @xmath131 the special case where @xmath14 converges to the orbit @xmath119 but not @xmath15 , corresponding to case ( c ) above , is precluded , except when the target state is such that its orbit is a periodic orbit ( circle ) in a in a 2d subspace . given any other pseudo - pure state @xmath15 , all initial states @xmath16 that are not part of the critical manifold of states for which @xmath139 and @xmath23 assumes its maximum , will converge to the target state @xmath15 for @xmath140 .      for @xmath131 pseudo - pure states",
    "are a very small subset of the state space .",
    "most states @xmath3 are generic with @xmath0 non - degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "we distinguish two cases here : stationary target states @xmath9 , which are diagonal ( in the eigenbasis of @xmath4 ) , and non - stationary target states .",
    "when @xmath9 is stationary , the dynamical system ( [ eqn : auto ] ) can be reduced to @xmath141\\\\   f(\\rho )      & = \\tr([-ih_1,\\rho(t)]\\rho_d ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the invariant set ( for an ideal system ) reduces accordingly to @xmath142 , which can be shown to be equivalent to the set of all @xmath143 with @xmath144 $ ] diagonal . furthermore , since @xmath9 is stationary and thus diagonal , the latter condition can further be reduced to @xmath144=0 $ ] by virtue of the following :    [ lemma:1 ] if @xmath94 is diagonal with non - degenerate eigenvalues and @xmath145 $ ] is diagonal , then @xmath146 is also diagonal and @xmath145=0 $ ] .",
    "the proof follows trivially from the fact that for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the @xmath149 component of @xmath145 $ ] is @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath145 $ ] is diagonal and @xmath151 then we must have @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "this leads to the following  @xcite :    [ thm : generic : crit ] if @xmath9 is a generic stationary target state then the invariant set @xmath47 contains exactly the @xmath154 critical points of the lyapunov function @xmath155 , i.e. , the stationary states @xmath156 , @xmath157 , which commute with @xmath9 and have the same spectrum .",
    "as @xmath9 is stationary and therefore diagonal , it follows that all @xmath156 are also diagonal , and their diagonal elements are a permutation of those of @xmath9 . since @xmath158 is constant for a hamiltonian system , the critical points of @xmath159 coincide with the critical points of @xmath160 , which can be regarded as the expectation value of the observable @xmath161 .",
    "we can immediately see that @xmath23 assumes its global minimum when the expectation value of @xmath162 assumes its maximum , i.e. , for @xmath163 , and its maximum when @xmath164 assumes its minimum .",
    "assuming @xmath165 and @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the permutation of @xmath168 that corresponds to a complete inversion , i.e. , @xmath169 , we have  @xcite : @xmath170 i.e. , @xmath171 and @xmath172 correspond to the global extrema of @xmath23 with @xmath112 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "it is furthermore easy to show that for a given generic stationary state @xmath9 the critical points of the lyapunov function @xmath159 are hyperbolic .",
    "however , since the dynamical system defined by our lyapunov control is not the gradient flow of @xmath159 , asymptotic stability of these fixed points can not be derived directly from the associated index number of the morse function @xmath23 .",
    "nonetheless , further analysis of the linearization of the dynamics near the critical points shows that  @xcite :    [ thm : generic : hyperbolic ] for a generic stationary target state @xmath9 all the critical points of the dynamical system  ( [ eqn : auto1 ] ) are hyperbolic .",
    "@xmath9 is the only sink , all other critical points are saddles , except the global maximum , which is a source .",
    "since the critical points of the dynamical system ( [ eqn : auto ] ) for a generic stationary state @xmath9 are hyperbolic and they are also hyperbolic critical points of the function @xmath174 , the dimension of the stable manifold at a critical point must be the same as the index number of the critical point of the function @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , since all critical points except the global minimum and maximum are saddle points , they are not repulsive , and therefore there are solutions @xmath14 outside @xmath47 that converge to these saddles , resulting in the failure of the lyapunov control method . however , as the dimensions of the stable manifolds at these points are smaller than @xmath175 , almost all solutions will still converge to the global minimum @xmath176 , and thus the lyapunov method is still ( mostly ) effective .    when the target state @xmath9 is not stationary , the situation is somewhat more complicated as the invariant set @xmath47 may contain points with nonzero diagonal commutators .",
    "consider @xmath177 and @xmath178 with @xmath179 @xmath177 and @xmath52 are isospectral and we have @xmath180= \\begin{pmatrix } 0 & 0 & 0   \\\\ 0 & \\frac{11}{144}i & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\frac{11}{144}i \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath102 but @xmath73\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "simulations suggest that @xmath14 does not converge to @xmath15 or @xmath119 in this case and thus lyapunov control fails .",
    "it is difficult to give a rigorous proof of this observation , however , as we lack a constructive method to ascertain asymptotic stability near a non - stationary solution . in the special case where @xmath15 is periodic there are tools such as poincar maps but it is difficult to write down an explicit form of the poincar map for general periodic orbits  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as observed earlier , for @xmath131 the orbits of non - stationary target states @xmath15 under @xmath4 are periodic only in some exceptional cases .",
    "fortunately , however , @xmath181=0\\}$ ] still holds for a very large class of generic target states @xmath15 , and in these cases lyapunov control tends to be effective . setting @xmath73=-\\ad_{\\rho_2}(\\rho_1)$ ] , where @xmath182 is a linear map from the hermitian or anti - hermitian matrices into @xmath183 , let @xmath184 be the real @xmath185 matrix corresponding to the stokes representation of @xmath182 .",
    "recall @xmath186 and @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the real subspaces corresponding to the cartan and non - cartan subspaces , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath192 be the first @xmath193 rows of @xmath184 ( whose image is @xmath189 )",
    ". then we can show  @xcite :    the invariant set @xmath47 for a generic @xmath15 contains points with nonzero commutator only if either @xmath9 has some equal diagonal elements or @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , the set of @xmath17 such that @xmath47 contains points with nonzero commutator has measure zero with respect to the state space @xmath18 .",
    "hence , if we choose a generic target state @xmath17 randomly , with probability one , it will be such that @xmath181=0\\}$ ] .",
    "choosing an orthonormal basis such that @xmath52 is diagonal , it thus follows that @xmath177 must be diagonal in this basis , and its diagonal elements a permutation of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 .",
    "thus for a given target state @xmath195 , there are again @xmath154 critical points @xmath196 . moreover ,",
    "for any @xmath102 with @xmath195 and @xmath197 for some @xmath67 , there exists a subsequence @xmath198 such that @xmath199 .",
    "in particular , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and hence , @xmath202 . therefore , we have @xmath203 .",
    "if @xmath102 is a different positive limiting point of @xmath28 , since @xmath204 decreases along the trajectory and the @xmath154 critical points are isolated , we must have @xmath197 for the same @xmath67 as for @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath203 holds for any positive limiting point @xmath51 and the corresponding subsequence @xmath198 .",
    "hence @xmath205 as @xmath12 , and some further analysis shows  @xcite :    [ thm : generic : conv1 ] if @xmath15 is a generic state with invariant set @xmath181=0\\}$ ] then any solution @xmath14 converges to one of the @xmath154 critical points @xmath206 , and all solutions except @xmath207 , which is stable , are unstable .",
    "thus we have a similar result as for generic stationary @xmath9 .",
    "the difference is that for the stationary @xmath9 , we can present a quantitative result about the dimensions of the stable manifolds and hence the measure of solutions that will converge to these points .",
    "for the non - stationary target case we can not establish the analogous result .",
    "however , simulations suggest that almost all solutions will converge to @xmath15 , and we can further prove a weaker result  @xcite :    for any of the unstable solutions , @xmath156 , @xmath208 , we can find solutions @xmath14 , with @xmath209 , that still converge to @xmath15 .",
    "the previous analysis relied on strong assumptions about the system , assuming @xmath4 strongly regular and @xmath5 fully connected .",
    "we shall now relax these requirements to see how the invariant set @xmath47 and the effectiveness of the lyapunov control method change . without loss of generality , we present the analysis for a three - level system , noting that the generalization to @xmath0-level systems is straightforward .",
    "first suppose @xmath4 is strongly regular , as for a morse oscillator , for example , but some of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath5 are zero , corresponding to transitions with zero transition probability .",
    "this is the case for many physical systems , where often only transitions between adjacent energy levels are permitted , and we rarely have non - vanishing transition probabilities for all possible transitions . for concreteness ,",
    "assume @xmath210 and @xmath211 where @xmath212 . in this case",
    ", we can prove  @xcite that any point @xmath102 must satisfy : @xmath180= \\begin{pmatrix } \\alpha_{11 } & 0 & e^{-i\\omega_{13}t}\\alpha_{13 }   \\\\ 0 & \\alpha_{22 } & 0   \\\\ e^{i\\omega_{13}t}\\alpha_{13}^ * & 0 & \\alpha_{33 } \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ]    hence , for a stationary and generic target state @xmath9 the points @xmath177 in @xmath47 must have the form @xmath213 we can prove that near the stationary point @xmath9 , the invariant set @xmath47 forms a centre manifold with @xmath9 as a centre  @xcite . therefore , the hartman - grobman theorem from the centre manifold theory , proved by carr  @xcite , implies that almost all solutions near @xmath15 converge to the ( periodic ) solutions on the centre manifold instead of the centre @xmath9 .",
    "lyapunov method in this case is ineffective .",
    "second , we consider the case of @xmath5 fully connected but @xmath4 is not strongly regular .",
    "for example , consider @xmath214 with @xmath215 , where @xmath216 . in this case",
    "we can also prove that the invariant set @xmath47 forms a centre manifold near @xmath9 with @xmath9 as a centre , and thus that almost all solutions near @xmath15 will converge to the periodic solutions on the centre manifold other than the centre @xmath9 , and hence that the lyapunov method is still ineffective .    in summary ,",
    "when either of the stringent conditions on the hamiltonians are relaxed even slightly , the invariant set @xmath47 becomes much larger , and in marked contrast to the ideal system case , and the lyapunov method fails for almost all cases .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the lyapunov control method for bilinear quantum control systems based on the application of the lasalle invariance principle . for the case of non - stationary target states ,",
    "this required considering the dynamics on an augmented state space on which the total system is autonomous .",
    "characterization and analysis of the invariant set of this dynamical system allowed us to establish a quite clear picture of the effectiveness of the lyapunov method depending on the properties of the system and the target state .",
    "in particular , our analysis suggests that the method is generally only effective under very stringent assumptions on the hamiltonian , and even in this case our analysis suggests a rather more complicated picture than previously presented in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , in that most of the critical points , for instance , are unstable but _ not _ repulsive .    for generic stationary target states",
    ", it can be shown explicitly that all of the unstable critical points except the global maximum in fact have attractive manifolds of positive dimension . for target states that are not stationary under the action of @xmath4",
    ", there are additional complications in that the invariant set can be larger than the set of critical points of the lyapunov function , although the set of target states @xmath15 for which this happens in the ideal system case is of measure zero .",
    "thus , while these issues complicate the problem for systems with strongly regular free ( drift ) hamiltonian @xmath4 and fully connected control hamiltonian @xmath5 , lyapunov control is still generally effective in that for most target states @xmath15 the invariant set contains only the critical points of the lyapunov function @xmath23 , and the target state @xmath15 is the only hyperbolic sink of the dynamical system .",
    "the situation changes radically when either of the twin requirements of strong regularity of @xmath4 and full connectedness of @xmath5 are relaxed , even slightly . in this case",
    "the method becomes not only less effective , but the emergence of centre manifolds around the target state suggests that the method is likely to become ineffective in practice . since the strict requirements above do not appear to be satisfied for most physical systems of interest , this suggests that the utility of this method for practical control field design is rather limited",
    ". it would be desirable to have stronger analytic results for non - stationary target states where well - established tools for stability and convergence analysis near fixed points are generally no longer applicable .",
    "although some theoretical tools such as the poincare map and floquet s theorem  @xcite exist , to fully answer the question of stability and convergence of lyapunov control for non - stationary ( and in general non - periodic ) target states , even for ideal bilinear hamiltonian systems , would seem to require the development of new tools in dynamical systems theory .",
