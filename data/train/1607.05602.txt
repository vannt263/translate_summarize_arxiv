    "simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) has recently attracted significant attention in academia , with works addressing many scenarios , a.o .",
    "mimo broadcasting @xcite , architecture @xcite , interference channel @xcite , broadband system @xcite , relaying @xcite .",
    "wireless power transfer ( wpt ) is a fundamental building block of swipt and the design of an efficient swipt architecture fundamentally relies on the ability to design efficient wpt .",
    "the major challenge with wpt , and therefore swipt , is to find ways to increase the dc power level at the output of the rectenna without increasing the transmit power .",
    "to that end , the vast majority of the technical efforts in the literature have been devoted to the design of efficient rectennas .",
    "the rectenna is made of a non - linear device followed by a low - pass filter to extract a dc power out of an rf input signal .",
    "the amount of dc power collected is a function of the input power level and the rf - to - dc conversion efficiency .",
    "interestingly , the rf - to - dc conversion efficiency is not only a function of the rectenna design but also of its input waveform @xcite .",
    "this observation has triggered very recent interests on wireless power waveform design in the signal processing literature @xcite .",
    "the objective is to understand how to make the best use of a given rf spectrum in order to deliver a maximum amount of dc power at the output of a rectenna .",
    "this problem can be formulated as a link optimization where transmit waveforms are adaptively designed as a function of the channel state information ( csi ) so as to maximize the dc power at the output of the rectifier . in @xcite ,",
    "the waveform design problem for wpt has been tackled by introducing a simple and tractable analytical model of the non - linearity of the diode through the second and higher order terms in the taylor expansion of the diode characteristics .",
    "comparisons were also made with a linear model of the rectifier , that only accounts for the second order term .",
    "assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) can be attained , relying on both the linear and non - linear models , an optimization problem was formulated to adaptively change on each transmit antenna a multisine waveform as a function of the csi so as to maximize the output dc current at the energy harvester .",
    "important conclusions of @xcite are that 1 ) multisine waveforms designed accounting for nonlinearity are spectrally more efficient that those designed based on a linear model of the rectifier , 2 ) the linear model does not characterize correctly the rectenna behaviour and leads to inefficient multisine waveform design , 3 ) rectifier nonlinearity is key to design efficient wireless powered systems .",
    "interestingly , the swipt literature has so far entirely relied on the aforementioned linear model of the rectifier , e.g. @xcite and subsequent works .",
    "the problem of swipt waveform and transceiver design that accounts for the nonlinearity of the rectifier has indeed never been addressed so far . in view of the recent results in @xcite",
    ", it is expected that accounting for the rectifier nonlinearity is key to efficient swipt design .    in this paper",
    ", we address the important problem of waveform and transceiver design for swipt .",
    "the contributions of the paper are summarized as follows .",
    "first , we leverage the analytical model of the rectenna non - linearity introduced in @xcite and investigate how a communication waveform ( ofdm ) and a power waveform ( multisine ) compare with each other in terms of harvested energy .",
    "comparison is also made with the linear model commonly used in the swipt literature @xcite .",
    "scaling laws of the harvested energy with multisine and ofdm waveforms are analytically derived as a function of the number of sinewaves and the propagation conditions .",
    "we show that with the nonlinear model of the rectifier , there is a clear benefit of using a deterministic multisine over an ofdm waveform for wpt . on the other hand ,",
    "the benefits vanish when we consider the linear model .",
    "second , we introduce a novel swipt transceiver architecture relying on the superposition of multisine and ofdm waveforms at the transmitter and a power - splitter receiver equipped with an energy harvester and an information decoder .",
    "both cases where the receiver does and does not have the capability of cancelling the multisine waveform are considered .",
    "the swipt multisine / ofdm waveforms and the power splitter are jointly optimized so as to maximize the rate - energy region of the whole system .",
    "the superposed swipt waveforms are adaptive to the channel state information and result from a posynomial maximization problem that originates from the non - linearity of the energy harvester .",
    "third , numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and swipt architecture .",
    "key observations are that 1 ) a power waveform ( superposed to a communication waveform ) is always useful to enlarge the rate - energy region of swipt , 2 ) a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy , 3 ) a non - zero mean gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity - achieving zero - mean gaussian input distribution .",
    "those observations are consequences of the non - linearity of the rectifier and highlights that exploiting the nonlinearity of the rectifier is essential to design an efficient swipt architecture .",

    "a first observation is that the rate - energy region is augmented by having a superposition of two ( power and communication ) waveforms in both cases where the communication receiver does and does not cancel the contribution of the power waveform , i.e.  @xmath336 and @xmath337 respectively .",

    "[ z_dc_results_swipt_snr ] and observation [ obs_main ] , the wpt multisine waveform is actually useful when the rectifier non - linearity is properly taken into account in the design of swipt .",
    "a second observation is that the gain of pc over nc increases as the snr increases . at low snr",
    ", the interference from the multisine waveform in nc is drawn within the noise and therefore does not impact much the rate - energy region .",
    "pc and nc therefore have similar regions at very low snr . on the other hand , as the snr increases , in order for nc not to become interference limited , the nc architecture needs to allocate a very small power to the multisine waveform over a wide range of rates .",
    "this leads to a loss in terms of @xmath168 compared to the pc architecture that fully benefits from the presence of the multisine waveforms ( and its superior efficiency in increasing @xmath168 ) .",

    "this behaviour is observed because of the concacity - convexity of the rate - energy region achieved by pc . on the other hand , in the absence of the wpt waveform ( ofdm - only transmission ) , the rate - energy region appears convex because of the inefficiency of the ofdm waveform to boost @xmath168 . at low snr ( as on fig [ z_dc_results_swipt_snr](a ) ) , the wf strategy for rate maximization coincides with the ass strategy for energy maximization .",
    "hence the ass strategy is used across the boundary and only changing the power splitting ratio enables to draw the region boundary . as the snr increases and wf allocates power over an increasing number of frequencies , the region boundary with `` no wpt waveform ''",
    "is getting rounded because of the log behaviour of the rate expression .    in summary , we draw the following conclusions from fig [ z_dc_results_swipt_n ] and [ z_dc_results_swipt_snr ] : 1 ) a power ( multisine ) waveform ( superposed to a communication ( ofdm ) waveform ) is useful to enlarge the rate - energy region of swipt , for @xmath8 sufficiently large ( @xmath338 ) .",

    "it is also noteworthy to recall that if we had used the linear model for the design and evaluation of the rate - energy region , following observation [ obs_main ] , there would not be any benefit of using a multisine waveform on top of the ofdm since both are equally suitable from an energy harvesting perspective .",
    "moreover , according to section [ ofdm_design ] , the optimum design of an ofdm waveform for wpt is the same for both the linear and non - linear model , namely based on the ass strategy .",
    "these facts imply that the rate - energy region achieved with a design of swipt based on the linear model is the same as the one achieved by `` no wpt waveform '' in fig [ z_dc_results_swipt_n ] and [ z_dc_results_swipt_snr ] .",
    "moreover , since the `` no wpt waveform '' strategy is always significantly outperformed by both pc and nc strategies in fig [ z_dc_results_swipt_n ] and [ z_dc_results_swipt_snr ] , this also implies that the design of swipt based on the non - linear rectifier model is more spectrally efficient than a design based on the linear model .",
    "the importance of accounting for the non - linearity of the rectifier in the design and evaluations of wpt was highlighted in @xcite .",
    "evaluations in this paper shows that this is also true for swipt .    as a final but very interesting observation",

    "this is the classical capacity achieving input distribution over a gaussian channel with average transmit power constraint . following remark [ remark_distribution ] , we note however that with `` pc '' and `` nc '' , the input distribution is gaussian but can have a non - zero mean .",
    "it is zero - mean as long as the ofdm waveform - only is used , but as we reduce the threshold @xmath267 and aim at a higher harvested energy , the waveform design algorithm starts allocating power over the multisine waveform .",
    "this has the effect of changing the input distribution from zero mean to non - zero mean .",
    "concurrently the variance of the distribution decreases since the transmit power allocated to the ofdm waveform is decreased , which leads to increasing k - factors ( defined in remark [ remark_distribution ] ) .",

    "<S> simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) has attracted significant attention in the communication community . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of waveform design has however never been addressed so far . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we first investigate how a communication waveform ( ofdm ) and a power waveform ( multisine ) compare with each other in terms of harvested energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that due to the non - linearity of the rectifier and the randomness of the information symbols , the ofdm waveform is less efficient than the multisine waveform for wireless power transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this observation motivates the design of a novel swipt transceiver architecture relying on the superposition of multisine and ofdm waveforms at the transmitter and a power - splitter receiver equipped with an energy harvester and an information decoder . </S>",
    "<S> the superposed swipt waveform is optimized so as to maximize the rate - energy region of the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> its design is adaptive to the channel state information and result from a posynomial maximization problem that originates from the non - linearity of the energy harvester . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and swipt architecture . </S>",
    "<S> key ( and refreshing ) observations are that 1 ) a power waveform ( superposed to a communication waveform ) is useful to enlarge the rate - energy region of swipt , 2 ) a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy , 3 ) exploiting the nonlinearity of the rectifier is essential to design efficient swipt architecture , 4 ) a non - zero mean gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity - achieving zero - mean gaussian input distribution . </S>"
