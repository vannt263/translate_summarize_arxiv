    "motivated by the differential lyapunov framework presented in @xcite to study incremental stability , the recent papers @xcite and @xcite introduced the notion of differential dissipativity to study incremental dissipativity , the analog of incremental stability for open systems . a related notion of tranverse incremental dissipativity",
    "is presented in @xcite to study limit cycles .",
    "the interest for incremental notions of stability and dissipativity stems from analysis and design problems concerned with a distance between arbitrary solutions rather than a distance to a particular ( equilibrium ) solution : such problems include regulation and tracking , estimation and observer design , or synchronization , coordination , and entrainment .    the differential approach to study incremental properties is rooted in contraction theory , following the influential paper of @xcite in control theory . in short , incremental properties of dynamical systems can be studied differentially , through the variational equations .",
    "the analysis of the variational equation ( or more precisely of the prolonged system ) is appealing because it leads to pointwise conditions to be verified on the prolonged vector field rather than on the solutions , in the spirit of lyapunov theory .",
    "the approach is geometric and the differential properties are potentially simpler to verify than their incremental counterparts",
    ".    the present paper pursues the developments of @xcite and @xcite to investigate how restrictive it is to check differential passivity on a given system .",
    "more fundamentally , we are interested in which class of physical systems are differentially passive and what is the physical interpretation of the property , if any .",
    "the success of passivity as an analysis and design concept of system theory stems from its clear energy interpretation in physical systems : passivity expresses that the increase of internally stored energy can not exceed the energy supplied by the environment .",
    "it is still unclear whether a similar interpretation exists for differential passivity .",
    "we provide geometric conditions that characterize differential passivity with respect to a quadratic storage and we further investigate the general conditions for a class of gradient systems .",
    "our motivation stems from the fact that a broad class of physical models admits a gradient representation in the coenergy framework , see e.g. @xcite , after the work of brayton and moser for nonlinear electrical circuits .",
    "the paper provides a number of simple examples that illustrate that differential passivity may hold for a sizable class of physical models and that feedback can help achieving the property , as for passivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we revisit the notion of differential passivity in section [ sec : passivity ] , providing the definitions of prolonged and variational system , differential storage , and differential supply rate .",
    "geometric conditions for passivity are summarized in section [ sec : geometric ] .",

    "<S> differential passivity is a property that allows to check with a pointwise criterion that a system is incrementally passive , a property that is relevant to study interconnected systems in the context of regulation , synchronization , and estimation . </S>",
