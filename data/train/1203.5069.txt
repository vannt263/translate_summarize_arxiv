    "hyperbolicity is observed in many real world networks such as the internet @xcite and data networks at the ip layer @xcite .",
    "the study of traffic flow and congestion in graphs is an important subject of research in graph theory .",
    "furthermore , it is an extremely important topic in network theory and more specifically , in the study of communication networks .",
    "one fundamental problem is to understand the traffic congestion under geodesic routing .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath6 be a family of graphs where @xmath7 .",
    "for each pair of nodes in @xmath8 , consider a unit flow that travels through the minimum path between nodes .",
    "hence , the total traffic flow in @xmath8 is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "if there is more than one minimum path for some pair of nodes then the flow splits equally among all the possible geodesic paths . given a node @xmath10",
    "we define @xmath11 as the total flow generated in @xmath8 passing through the node @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , @xmath11 is the sum off all the geodesic paths in @xmath8 which are carrying flow and contain the node @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the maximum vertex flow across the network @xmath14 it is easy to see that for any graph @xmath15 .",
    "it was observed in many complex networks , man - made or natural , that the typical distance between the nodes is surprisingly small .",
    "more formally , as a function of the number of nodes @xmath3 , the average distance between nodes scales typically as @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , many of these complex networks , specially communication networks , have high congestion .",
    "more precisely , there exists a small number of nodes called the _",
    "where most of the traffic pass through , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "we said that a family of graphs is asymptotically @xmath4hyperbolic if there exists a non  negative @xmath4 such that for all @xmath3 sufficiently large the graph @xmath8 is @xmath4gromov hyperbolic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was observed experimentally in @xcite , and proved formally in @xcite , that if the family is asymptotically hyperbolic then the maximum vertex congestion scales as @xmath18 . in section [ congestion ] , we show that for random @xmath0regular graphs with @xmath1 the maximum vertex congestion scales as @xmath2 , suggesting a non  hyperbolic nature .",
    "furthermore , in section [ non - hyper ] , we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "more precisely , we show that random @xmath0regular graphs are not @xmath4hyperbolic for any non ",
    "negative @xmath4 asymptotically almost surely .",
    "this is in contrast with the well  known fact that these graphs are very good expanders and hence , they have a large spectral gap .",

    "for every pair of nodes in a graph @xmath19 there exists at least one shortest path ( we assume that each link has unit length ) between them .",
    "we denote a geodesic between a pair of nodes @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xmath22 $ ] . a triangle @xmath23 in @xmath24",
    "is called @xmath4thin if each of the shortest paths @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] is contained within the @xmath4 neighborhoods of the other two . more specifically ,",

    "the notion of ( coarse ) gromov hyperbolicity ( see @xcite ) is then defined as follows .",
    "a metric graph is @xmath4hyperbolic if all geodesic triangles are @xmath4thin , for some fixed non - negative @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that all tree graphs are @xmath4hyperbolic , with @xmath28 .",
    "we also observe that all finite graphs are @xmath4hyperbolic for large enough @xmath4 , e.g. , by letting @xmath4 to be equal to the diameter of the graph .    in this section",
    ", we explore the maximum vertex congestion with geodesic routing for random @xmath0regular graphs .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , gromov hyperbolic graphs have congestion of the order @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , any @xmath29regular tree ( also called a bethe lattice ) has highly congested nodes .",
    "more precisely , the following result was proved in @xcite .    for a @xmath29regular tree with @xmath3 nodes",
    "then @xmath30 furthermore , the maximum congestion occurs at the root .",
    "note that trees are some of the most congested graphs one can consider .",
    "the reason is that much of the traffic must pass through the root of the tree .    in what follows",
    "we prove the main result of this section but we first need the following results .",

    "let @xmath32 and define @xmath35 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath36 and moreover @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath38 where the inequality is coming from the fact that if @xmath39 then the geodesic path between a node in @xmath40 and a node in @xmath41 does not pass through @xmath12 . hence , @xmath42    it was proved in @xcite that the diameter of a random @xmath0regular satisfies the following upper bound almost surely .",
    "[ boll ] for @xmath1 and sufficiently large @xmath3 , a random @xmath0regular graph @xmath19 with @xmath3 nodes has diameter at most @xmath43 where @xmath24 is a fixed constant depending on @xmath0 and independent on @xmath3 .",
    "now we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section .",
    "let @xmath19 be a random @xmath0regular graph with @xmath1 and @xmath3 nodes .",
    "then the maximum vertex flow with geodesic routing on @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath44 asymptotically almost surely as @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a vertex in @xmath19 then by applying lemma [ ll ] we obtain @xmath45 since @xmath46 with high probability , we see that @xmath47 now taking the maximum over all the vertices finished the argument .    in figure [ plot ] , we observe the maximum vertex flow for a random @xmath48regular graph as a function of the number of vertices .",
    "we also see in comparison the function @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "the previous definition of @xmath4hyperbolicity is equivalent to gromov s four points condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a graph @xmath19 satisfies the gromov s four points condition , and hence it is @xmath4hyperbolic , if and only if @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath19 .",
    "as it was defined in @xcite , an _ almost geodesic cycle _ @xmath24 in a graph @xmath19 is a cycle in which for every two vertices @xmath12 and @xmath55 in @xmath24 , the distance @xmath56 is at least @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the distance in the graph and @xmath59 is the corresponding distance within the loop @xmath24 .",
    "the following result was proved in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be a random @xmath0regular graph with @xmath3 nodes and let @xmath60 be a function going to infinity such that @xmath61 . then almost all pair of vertices @xmath12 and @xmath55 in @xmath19 belong to an almost geodesic cycle @xmath24 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .        by the previous theorem there",
