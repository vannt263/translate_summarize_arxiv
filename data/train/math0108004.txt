    "anti - self - dual connections on @xmath2 with quadratic curvature decay , so - called _ doubly - periodic instantons _ , have been studied by various authors both from the mathematical @xcite and from the physical @xcite points of view .    for physicists , the motivation to study periodic instantons on @xmath3 , that is anti - self - dual connections on @xmath4 ( calorons ) , @xmath1 ( doubly - periodic instantons ) and @xmath5 ( spatially - periodic instantons ) , come from the observation that these can be viewed as limiting cases of configurations on the 4-dimensional torus ( regarded as instantons periodic on all 4 directions ) where either three",
    ", two or one directions are taken to be very large when compared to the others @xcite .",
    "in particular , doubly - periodic instantons are closely related to self - dual , vortex - like configurations on @xmath3 , that is configurations that are concentrated near a two - dimensional plane @xcite .",
    "one striking feature is that even though there are no charge one instantons on @xmath6 @xcite , partially periodic instantons of unit charge can be shown to exist .",
    "therefore , there must be obstructions to _ folding _ instantons along the non - compact directions ( that is passing from an instanton on @xmath7 to an instanton on @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , the precise mechanism underlying such phenomena is yet to be understood .",
    "the idea is that the folding of charge one partially periodic instantons inevitably leads to a _ singular _ instanton on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "charge one calorons have been studied in some detail by kraan and van baal @xcite , among others",
    ". a closer study of spatially - periodic instantons , though , remain as a glaring gap in the mathematical literature ; see however @xcite .",
    "the careful study of doubly - periodic instantons with unit charge is the main motivation for the present work .",
    "we begin by summarizing the classification of rank 2 instantons and their correspondence with certain holomorphic vector bundles , as established in @xcite .",
    "we then use the fourier - mukai transform to relate doubly - periodic instantons and rational maps @xmath9 , providing a more detailed description of the moduli space .",
    "although the existence of doubly - periodic instantons was guaranteed in @xcite , not all possible values of the asymptotic parameters can be realized .",
    "surprisingly , global topological obstructions for particular values do arise . in section [ charge1 ]",
    ", we describe all such obstructions for doubly - periodic instantons with unit charge .",
    "we argue that there exist a _ basic doubly - periodic instanton _ , out of which all others are obtained via translations .",
    "finally , in section [ exist ] , one existence and one non - existence result for instantons with higher charge and given asymptotic parameters are discussed .",
    "consider an @xmath0 bundle @xmath10 . as in @xcite , let @xmath11 be a connection on @xmath12 such that @xmath13 ; then @xmath14 if the limit @xmath15 exists , where @xmath16 is the radial coordinate in @xmath17 . ] with respect to the euclidean metric on @xmath2 normalized so that @xmath18 has unit volume . as usual , we define the _ charge _ of @xmath11 by the formula : @xmath19    special solutions of the anti - self - duality equations may be obtained by restricting to torus invariant connections .",
    "such instantons come from solutions @xmath20 of hitchin s equations on @xmath17 : @xmath21=0 \\\\ { \\overline{\\partial}}_b\\psi=0 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in the following way .",
    "recall that @xmath22 is a @xmath0 connection on @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a ( 1,0)-form with values in @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 , and consider the connection ( where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are coordinates on @xmath18 ) : @xmath29 which is a torus invariant instanton connection .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 , the asymptotic behavior of solutions @xmath20 is given by one of the following models : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the solutions of examples ( [ ex1 ] ) and ( [ ex2 ] ) can be superimposed , and such superpositions are called the _ semisimple _ solutions . on the other hand ,",
    "solutions of example ( [ ex3 ] ) can not be superimposed with the others ; these are called the _ nilpotent _ solutions , and can only exist when @xmath34 .    the torus invariant instanton is then given by , in the semisimple case : @xmath35 with @xmath36 while in the nilpotent case , we have : @xmath37    remark that the connection @xmath38 has a flat limit over the torus at infinity , i.e. as @xmath39 : @xmath40 this limiting flat connection underlies a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath41 , where the elements @xmath42 of the dual torus @xmath43 are called the _ asymptotic states _ of the connection",
    ". moreover , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are called the _ residue _ and the _ limiting holonomy _ of @xmath11 , respectively .    as it was shown in @xcite",
    ", the three standard examples above completely describe the behavior at infinity of doubly - periodic instantons with quadratic curvature decay :    [ asymp.par ] let @xmath11 be a doubly - periodic instanton connection such that @xmath13 .",
    "then there is a gauge near infinity such that @xmath46 where @xmath38 is one of the previous models ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ nilp ] ) , and , for some @xmath47 , in the semisimple case : @xmath48 in the nilpotent case : @xmath49    in short , doubly - periodic instantons can be classified according to their asymptotic parameters @xmath50 .

    "thus if we begin with the assumption @xmath52 and apply the nahm transform , we end up with a singular higgs pair as described in @xcite .",
    "we can then nahm transform this higgs pair back into a doubly - periodic instanton @xmath53 which is gauge equivalent to @xmath11 , but such that @xmath54 , see @xcite .",

    "the case of doubly - periodic instantons ( d=2 ) was carefully described by the author in @xcite , where it has been shown that doubly - periodic instantons are equivalent to certain singular solutions of hitchin s equations on a 2-dimensional torus .",
    "the asymptotic parameters described in the previous section are translated into data describing the singularities of the higgs pair , see @xcite for the detailed statement .",
    "since a theorem of simpson @xcite guarantees the existence of singular higgs pairs for generic values of the singularities parameters , _ the existence of doubly - periodic instantons for all @xmath59 and generic values of the asymptotic parameters is also guaranteed via nahm transform_.    more generally , nahm transform has so far been the single most powerful tool to prove existence of invariant instantons on @xmath3 ( e.g. the adhm construction of instantons , hitchin s approach to monopoles , etc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "nahm transform can also be used to prove _ non - existence _ results as well .",
    "a typical example is the non - existence of charge one instantons over @xmath6 mentioned on the introduction ; see also theorem [ non - ex1 ] below for a similar result concerning doubly - periodic instantons .    in this paper",
    "however , we adopt a different point of view , which seems better suited for our purposes . as suggested by the authors in @xcite",
    ", we will use a hitchin - kobayashi correspondence , that is a correspondence between instantons on @xmath1 and certain holomorphic vector bundles over @xmath60 , as our main tool to obtain more precise existence and nonexistence results . here",
    ", @xmath61 denotes the elliptic curve coming from a choice of complex structure on @xmath18 .",

    "the main lesson we take from this theorem is that _ asymptotic behaviour does impose obstructions to the existence of instantons _ !",
    "the occurrence of such obstructions is indeed rather surprising , since the asymptotic models ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ nilp ] ) are well - defined for all @xmath67 .",
    "thus we conclude that this must be a global , topological phenomenon .",

    "moreover , the moduli space @xmath178 of such instantons is isometric to @xmath1 with the flat metric .    by the results of @xcite",
    ", @xmath178 is a complete hyperkhler manifold of real dimension 4 .",
    "since @xmath1 acts isometrically on @xmath178 via translations , the last assertion follows easily .",
    "the theorem implies that _ there exists a `` basic instanton '' of unit charge , from which all others are obtained by translation_. ford et al .",
    "have obtained closed formulas for the charge one instanton restricted to the plane @xcite , while gonzlez - arroyo and montero have studied it numerically @xcite .",
    "however , the precise analytic formula for the charge one instanton is still unknown .",
    "therefore , it is also reasonable to interpret the @xmath174 real parameters needed to describe the moduli space of charge @xmath59 instantons as @xmath233 parameters describing the positions of @xmath59 basic instantons in @xmath2 , plus @xmath234 parameters describing their relative positions .",
    "while there are no charge one instantons over @xmath6 , instantons over @xmath6 with higher charge are known to exist @xcite .",
    "our goal in this section is to argue that the situation for doubly - periodic instantons is more nuanced : existence depends on the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "it is hard to obtain a complete description of the obstructions to existence posed by asymptotic behaviour , as we did for unit charge in the previous section .",
    "we conclude this paper with the proof of our second main result .",
    "same as the existence argument in the proof of theorem [ chargeone ] ; let @xmath220 be a non - constant rational map of degree @xmath59 such that @xmath221 $ ] and @xmath222 . lift its graph to @xmath100 to obtain a ( smooth ) curve @xmath128 , and let @xmath223 . as we have seen in lemma [ nonconst ] ,",
    "@xmath69 is @xmath45-stable , for all @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , semisimple instantons with @xmath68 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be produced in the same way , since there are non - constant rational maps of degree @xmath236 with derivative vanishing at @xmath90 .",
    "however , we ll leave open the question of whether there exist nilpotent instantons of charge @xmath68 .",
    "finally , it is also worth noting that theorems [ chargeone ] and [ highcharge ] can also be interpreted as existence / non - existence results for the type of singular solutions of hitchin s equations on the torus obtained via nahm transform ( see @xcite ) ."
