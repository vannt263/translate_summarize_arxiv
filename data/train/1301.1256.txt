    "exponential random graph models are mean field models and therefore the analogues of the various statistical mechanics ensembles ( microcanonical , grand canonical , pressure , @xmath0 ) which are equivalent in the infinite volume limit for particle systems with short range interactions @xcite , need not be equivalent in these mean field models ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "( equivalence of ensembles is discussed further in the conclusion . ) in this work we use the microcanonical ensemble of one of the best known exponential random graph models , one originally formulated by strauss @xcite , and give evidence of phase transitions which are not as accessible in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the transitions previously analyzed for a wide class of exponential random graphs are similar to liquid / gas transitions in that they are transitions between graphs of similar character , of the same ( fluid - like ) phase @xcite , while the transitions we focus on in the microcanonical ensemble are analogous to solid / solid transitions , transitions between graphs of different phases .",

    "the lower boundary consists of the scalloped curve together with the ` first scallop ' , the line from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",

    "so far we have proven that @xmath85 next we must show that the right hand side is equal to @xmath86 . by definition , we can find a sequence of reduced graphons @xmath87 such that @xmath88 . since @xmath89 is compact , these reduced graphons converge to a reduced graphon @xmath90 , represented by a graphon @xmath91 . since @xmath92 is lower - semicontinuous @xcite , @xmath93 ,",
    "so @xmath94 .",

    "otherwise , the graphon @xmath108 would have no triangles and would have edge density greater than 1/2 , which is impossible .",
    "so we restrict attention to graphons that are zero on a set of measure at least 1/2 and have edge density @xmath70 . from the convexity of @xmath109 , we know that the graphon minimizing @xmath92 must be zero on a set of measure 1/2 and must be constant on the rest .",
    "thus @xmath106 is a minimizer , and @xmath110 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath57 is another minimizer .",
    "since @xmath57 is zero on a set of measure 1/2 and is @xmath111 on a set of measure 1/2 , @xmath112 is 1 on a set of measure 1/2 , and so describes a graphon with edge density 1/2 and no triangles .",
    "this means that @xmath112 describes a complete bipartite graph with the two parts having the same measure . that is , @xmath112 is equivalent to the graphon that equals 1 if @xmath113 or @xmath114 and is zero everywhere else .",

    "( @xmath125 denotes the largest integer greater than or equal to @xmath29 . )",
    "these additional edges can take any form , as long as there are no triangles within the last piece .",
    "this means that , after possibly renumbering the vertices , the graphon for such a graph can be written as an uneven @xmath126 checkerboard obtained from cutting the unit interval into pieces @xmath127 $ ] for @xmath128 and @xmath129 $ ] , with the checkerboard being 1 outside the main diagonal , 0 on the main diagonal except the upper right corner , and corresponding to a zero - triangle graph in the upper right corner",

    "this now implies a bijection @xmath227 such that @xmath21 and @xmath224 have the same optimizing states , at least off some manageable sets of parameter pairs corresponding to ` phase coexistence ' where the bijection can degenerate to a many - to - one map @xcite .    in exponential random graph models , which are mean field rather than short range , the entropy need not be concave @xcite and indeed this fails in an obvious way for the specific model we are analyzing , the strauss model , since even the domain @xmath11 of the entropy is not convex ( see figure 1 ) . therefore in the infinite node limit of the model the free energy density @xmath224 , need not be equivalent to the entropy density @xmath21 ; @xmath224 can be obtained from @xmath21 by legendre transform , but it may not be possible to recover @xmath21 from @xmath224 .",
    "inequivalence can result from the existence of graphons maximizing @xmath21 for some @xmath10 which are not maximizers of @xmath224 for any @xmath228 .",

    "these graphs all lie on the curve @xmath229 in figure 1 , not a 2-dimensional region in that microcanonical phase space , making it difficult to use singularities of the free energy @xmath224 to imply singularities of the entropy @xmath21 .",
    "for this reason we have focused here on phase transitions in the lower region of the microcanonical phase space , figure 1 .",
    "we have shown that our ( , bipartite ) graphons @xmath57 of theorem [ near ] maximize the entropy density at least to second order in perturbation theory , among graphons with a limited range of edge and triangle densities .",
    "assuming the @xmath57 are actually global maximizers we then proved the entropy density would have to lose analyticity as the edge density of the graphon approaches the tripartite regime .",
    "we also show that the entropy density must suffer a phase transition as the triangle density is raised sufficiently high , presumably from the structured bipartite phase to a homogeneous phase of higher triangle density .",
    "we expect that a more complicated analysis could produce appropriate graphons @xmath231 , near each of the higher edge density ( multipartite ) graphons of minimial triangle density , with a transition near each scallop intersection .",
    "intuitively this suggests a mechanism whereby as edge density is increased , near the minimum triangle density graphon , the system progressively transitions through finer and finer structure ; for high edge density most graphs would consist of many interacting ` parts ' .",
    "our results on phase transitions require that the graphons of theorem [ near ] be in fact global , not just local , maximizers of the entropy density . in a future paper",
