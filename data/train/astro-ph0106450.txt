    "broad fe k@xmath0 line emission and the so - called reflection  hump \" centered around @xmath2 kev are thought to be significant observational signatures of the presence of cold matter in the vicinity of the event horizons of accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) .",
    "these spectral features result from the x - ray illumination of the surface of optically thick and relatively cold matter ( e.g. , basko , sunyaev & titarchuk 1974 ; lightman & white 1988 ; white , lightman & zdziarski 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ; poutanen , nagendra & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "because the accretion disks which power this class of sources are optically thick and relatively cool they were considered to be the natural sites at which these spectral features are produced ; futhermore , it has been suggested that accurate measurements of the properties of these features can be used to determine the properties of the associated accretion disks .",
    "for example , the normalization of the reflection component can provide an estimate of the solid angle covered by the accretion disk as seen from the x - ray source , while the precise fe k@xmath0  line profile constrains the radial structure of such a disk and the underlying space - time geometry ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) .    unfortunately , the _ steady - state _ line profile depends on many parameters ",
    "e.g. , the viewing angle , the inner and outer disk radii , and the fe k@xmath0  emissivity as a function of radius .",
    "it is impossible to constrain the actual values of all of these parameters simultaneously ( see , e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "1999 for the example of ncg  3516 ) .",
    "moreover , the line profile itself can not constrain the mass of the black hole . for this reason , in the absence of telescopes of sufficiently high angular resolution , it is hoped that the degeneracy in the steady - state models can be removed through observations of time variability of the spectral features ( stella 1990 , matt & perola 1992 ; campana & stella 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "complimentary , this would also set limits on the physical size of the emitting region and hence determine the black hole mass . reynolds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and young & reynolds ( 2000 ) suggested that a red - ward moving  bump \" in the fe k@xmath0  line profile after an x - ray flare would be a robust signature of a maximally rotating kerr black hole , thus providing information about the black hole properties inaccessible by other means ; it is also hoped that similar observations may even be used to test general relativity in the strong limit ( see also ruszkowski 2000 ) .",
    "observational facts gathered to date signal that correlated spectral and timing analysis of data should indeed be very fruitful in testing models : almost every time that theories were subjected to observational scrutiny , agn produced surprizes that required modifications of these theories .",
    "for example , in the completely analogous situation of optical and uv agn line emission , reverbaration mapping campaigns indicated that the size of the broad line region ( blr ) is smaller by roughly a factor of ten than previously thought ( see netzer & peterson 1997 for a review ) .",
    "correlated optical ",
    "uv ( ouv ) continuum variability observations have shown the lags between these two bands to be much shorter than those expected on the basis of the prevailing accretion disk models .",
    "this led to the ( reasonable ) suggestion that the correlated o - uv variability ought to result from the reprocessing of x - rays onto the o - uv emitting disks ( krolik et al . 1991 ) , only to be challenged later by correlated ouv - x - ray monitoring campaigns ( nandra et al .",
    "1998 ; edelson et al .",
    "2000 ) that did not show the expected correlations .",
    "a few existing attempts to observe fe k@xmath0  line reverberation also provided frustrating results .",
    "a search for the fe k@xmath0  line response to continuum variations was performed for mcg63015 ( lee et al . 2000 ; reynolds 2000 ) and ngc 5548 ( chiang et al .",
    "2000 ) . whereas the continuum x - ray flux was strongly variable on short time scales",
    ", the fe k@xmath0  line flux did not correlate with it .",
    "vaughan & edelson ( 2001 ) have split the light curve of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 into much shorter time intervals than those done by the previous authors  in bins of rxte orbital sampling period .",
    "while fe k@xmath0  line flux is found to vary on very short time scales , it is not correlated with the continuum x - ray flux .",
    "this behavior is not predicted by any of the aforementioned theoretical papers , and it clearly deserves an explanation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the microphysics of the problem ",
    "i.e. , the time - dependent photo - ionized x - ray reflection  in greater detail than it has been done so far .",
    "the existing theoretical literature on fe k@xmath0  line reverberation ( reynolds et al . 1999 ; young & reynolds 2000 ; ruszkowski 2000 ) are based on the assumption that the illuminated gas maintains a constant density , independent of the value of the x - ray flux , a common assumption of pre - year-2000 literature ( e.g. , ross & fabian 1993 ; matt , fabian & ross 1993 , 1996 ; @xmath3ycki et al .",
    "1994 ; ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) . in this case one is fortunate in that it is possible to formulate a set of rules that determine the emissivity of the line as a function of the _ instantaneous _ value of the ionizing flux , a fact which greatly simplifies this extremely complex problem .",
    "however , several other treatments of the static x - ray reflection problem did not use the constant density assumption considering it may be too restrictive or unrealistic ( e.g. , basko , sunyaev & titarchuk 1974 ; raymond 1993 ; ko & kallman 1994 ; r@xmath4aska & czerny 1996 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 , nkk hereafter ) .",
    "these authors employed the condition of hydrostatic balance in order to compute ( rather than assume ) the gas density .",
    "the code of nkk was designed for conditions typical of the inner regions of agn accretion disks and is especially well placed to compare the predictions of these models with those employing constant density .",
    "substantial differences in the reflected spectra were found ( see also ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "the root of these differences can be traced to the presence of a thermal ionization instability ( tii ) under conditions of constant pressure , previously known from studies of agn line emitting clouds ( e.g. , krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ; see also field 1965 ) . because this instability is present only under constant pressure conditions , it is absent when the constant density assumption is imposed .",
    "nkk , done & nayakshin ( 2001 ) and ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) conclude that the constant density models are not to be trusted .",
    "therefore , the _ quantitative _ fe k@xmath0  line reverberation pattern may in fact be different from that found by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , young & reynolds ( 2000 ) and ruszkowski ( 2000 ) , and it is the purpose of this paper to attempt to clarify in which way",
    ". we must mention from the outset , however , that because of the extreme computational overhead , we only study local reflection spectra and do not integrate over the entyre disk surface to produce full time - dependent responce of fe k@xmath0  line .",
    "our study is thus only an initial step in the right direction and an additional work will be required to calculate the final fe k@xmath0  line transfer function .",
    "the main new effect that we find below can be summarized as follows . within the constant density approach",
    ", the ionization state of the illuminated gas is determined mainly by the instantaneous value of the ionization parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the the x - ray flux and @xmath7 is the local gas density .",
    "given that @xmath7 is assumed to be unchanged , the resulting fe k@xmath0  line flux is a function of @xmath6 only .",
    "all the line reverberation studies to date have made use of this fact ( e.g. , see  iia in blandford & mckee 1982 and  2 in reynolds et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the context of hydrostatic balance models ,",
    "the gas density at each point is calculated from the hydrostatic equilibrium condition ( together with ionization and energy balances , and radiation transfer ) .",
    "a change in the x - ray flux will lead to changes in the gas temperature profile , disturbing hydrostatic balance .",
    "the latter can be re - established after time @xmath8 of order of the local dynamical time . during this time the ionized disk structure is out of equilibrium with the incident x - ray flux , and hence the fe",
    "k@xmath0  line emissivity is not a function of @xmath6 . in other words ,",
    "the hydrostatic balance models have a relaxation time scale that is not present in the constant density models , and it is important to understand possible implications of this for the general x - ray reflection problem .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we establish the important physical quantities and observables that determine the _ static _ reflected spectrum in the general case of a photo - ionized reflector , and then discuss which of these can realistically be measured in future fe k@xmath0  line reverberation studies . in ",
    "3 we estimate time scales of the problem , while in  4 numerical approach and tests are presented .",
    "discussion of the results and their implications for current observations are given in  5 , and  6 lists our conclusions .",
    "x - ray emission is a ubiquitous feature of the agn spectra .",
    "it is believed that the x - rays are emitted in a hot corona which is located in the vicinity of the compact object , just as the cooler , optically thin , geometrically thick accretion disks .",
    "the proximity of these two distinct components of agn emission implies that accretion disks are expected to be strongly photo - ionized by the x - rays , the more so the larger the accretion rate is ( e.g. , matt et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 , nayakshin 2000b ) .",
    "based on the extensive literature and our own calculations , we find that the following quantities determine the spectrum of the reprocessed x - rays :    \\(1 ) the absolute value of the incident x - ray flux around the iron recombination band , @xmath6 ; this is the most important parameter associated with the fe k@xmath0  line emission . in the case of neutral reflection ,",
    "the line emissivity , @xmath9 , and therefore the line ew is constant ( unless the spectrum of the reprocessed x - rays is variable ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the value of the locally produced thermal disk emission , @xmath10 .",
    "the absolute value of ratio @xmath11 affects the temperature of the ionized skin ( see nayakshin & kallman 2001 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the photon spectral index of the incident radiation , @xmath12 .",
    "george & fabian ( 1991 ) have shown that the ew of the line increases by about a factor of 1.6 as @xmath12 decreases from 2.3 to 1.3 .",
    "for neutral reflection , the physics of this dependence is rather simple  as @xmath12 changes , the amount of x - ray photons capable of photo - ionizing the fe k - shell changes , and so does the ew of the line .    in the case of photo - ionized reflection ,",
    "the spectral index plays a more prominent role as it also determines the temperature of the line emitting gas ( nkk , ballantyne et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the abundance array for important elements , @xmath13 .",
    "\\(5 ) the inclination of the disk with respect to the observer , @xmath14 .",
    "\\(6 ) the high energy spectral shape .",
    "it is commonly argued that this part of the spectrum does not affect much the fe k@xmath0  line emission because very few photons in this energy range are responsible for k - shell photoionization . however , under the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium considered herein , this part of the spectrum is instrumental in the determination of the compton temperature of the ionized gas and therefore its ionization state , thus impacting significantly the fe k@xmath0  emission .",
    "see the appendix where the role of the cut - off energy @xmath15 is enunciated through several numerical tests",
    ".    summarizing the foregoing discussion , the line flux is a function of : @xmath16\\ ; , \\label{fline}\\ ] ] where we divided the variables into two groups .",
    "the second group of variables ( those in the curly brackets ) is not expected to vary on short time scales and hence these variables can be considered fixed in fe k@xmath0  line reverberation studies .",
    "indeed , @xmath17 , the disk thermal luminosity , is clearly the fastest varying parameter out of the second group .",
    "it is expected to vary on the disk thermal time scale , which is a factor @xmath18 longer than the disk dynamical time scale .",
    "so , unless @xmath0 is close to unity , @xmath19 const on the light crossing time scales of the inner disk . on the contrary",
    ", we expect the three parameters from the first group to be variable on roughly same time scales on which @xmath6 varies .",
    "for example , when either the geometry of the x - ray source or its luminosity varies , the heating / cooling balance of the hot gas ought to change as well , affecting values of @xmath12 and @xmath15 .    equation ( [ fline ] ) clearly displays the challenges one would face when analyzing fe k@xmath0  line reverberation data : in the case of more than one parameter variations in the ionizing flux properties , the line flux is not a function of any one single parameter but depends on all of them .",
    "therefore , studies of the correlation of the line flux with the continuum flux _",
    "alone _ may be insufficient to uniquely determine the physical parameters of the problem and yield model independent conclusions .",
    "we will come back to this point in  [ sect : rel ] .",
    "the high energy rollover is the parameter most difficult to measure on short time scales . to circumvent this problem",
    ", one can concentrate on targets that are relatively dim in terms of ratio @xmath20 ( but not in terms of the observed x - ray flux ! ) , since then no strongly ionized skin is expected .",
    "another approach is to pick agn with @xmath21 . although we have not presented any tests for these cases",
    ", it is obvious that for steep x - ray spectra , the compton temperature becomes insensitive to the exact value and shape of the high energy roll - over when @xmath22 is sufficiently large . even if @xmath15 is highly variable",
    ", the temperature and the thomson depth of the skin will be largely independent of its value .",
    "the problem of static x - ray illumination of an accretion disk involves at least four major physical processes , none of which can be neglected if an accurate solution to the problem is sought .",
    "these processes are : ( 1 ) the ionization balance for the illuminated gas ; ( 2 ) the balance of heating and cooling ; ( 3 ) the hydrostatic balance ; and ( 4 ) the transfer of the radiation through the slab .",
    "if the illuminating radiation field    were constant for a long period of time and then ( at time @xmath23 for convenience ) changed to a new intensity ( spectral shape , etc ) level , then each of these four processes will be taken out of equilibrium .",
    "it is thus necessary to ask how long it will take to re - establish the equilibrium corresponding to the new ionizing intensity .",
    "this time should then be compared to the light travel time across the inner most disk region to see whether the non - equilibrium effects can be important for fe k@xmath0  line reverberation studies .",
    "the radiation transfer time scale , @xmath24 , is approximately @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the thomson depth of the ionized layer of material where most of the reflected spectral features are formed , and @xmath27 is the spatial extent of this slab .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is a few ( see , e.g. , ross & fabian 1993 ; nkk ) , so @xmath24 is only a factor of few longer than the light crossing time @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining three time scales were discussed by krolik , mckee & tarter ( 1981 ;  iia ) for agn line emitting clouds , and we will simply re - scale their estimates for the ionized skin .",
    "these authors found the radiative recombination time scale for a hydrogenic ion of charge @xmath29 to be about @xmath30 sec , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 k. this time scale is longest in the ionized skin ( rather than in the cold dense material below it ) , because there the gas temperature reaches its maximum while the pressure has its minimum .",
    "we can estimate @xmath33 from the fact that the ionization parameter in the skin is very high , i.e. , @xmath34 ( e.g. , ross , fabian & young 1999 ; @xmath6 is the ionizing x - ray flux , and @xmath35 is hydrogen density ) .",
    "using @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total disk ( or lamppost ) x - ray luminosity , and @xmath38 is the radius under consideration , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath41 solar masses , @xmath42 is the radius in units of schwarzschild  radius , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 erg@xmath46 s@xmath47 . to put this estimate into perspective ,",
    "one should compare it to the light crossing time , @xmath48 : @xmath49    the hydrostatic time scale , @xmath50 , is @xmath51 where @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath53 is the sound speed , and hence @xmath54 it is worth noticing that this time scale is always longer than the light crossing time .    finally , the thermal time scale can be shown to be longest on the top of the ionized skin , where heating and cooling are dominated by the compton scattering .",
    "writing @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is thomson cross section , and @xmath57 is the radiation energy density , we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "note that if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then this time scale can be longer than the light crossing time scale .",
    "fortunately , for such low values of @xmath62 , the thomson depth of the skin is small ( see , e.g. , nayakshin 2000a ) and thus the existence of the skin is not important : the reflector is effectively cold .",
    "thus , in practical terms , it is reasonable to fix our attention on the cases when @xmath63 .",
    "let us now review these simple estimates in the light of efforts to measure fe k@xmath0  line reverberation in agn . unless the observer is exactly pole - on and the x - ray luminosity is a dirac @xmath64-function in time , one always samples emission from a range of radii .",
    "variability of the signal over time scales less than @xmath48 will be difficult to measure , so that it only makes sense to talk about variability on time scales longer than the light crossing time is the radius within which a significant fraction of the x - ray intensity is reprocessed by the disk .",
    "for example , in the lamppost model , with height of the source @xmath65 above the black hole , @xmath66 .",
    "according to the foregoing discussion , we have @xmath67 the general problem of the time - dependent x - ray illumination of accretion disks can be solved assuming that the radiation field , ionization and thermal balances adjust to the new value of the ionizing flux instantaneously , but the gas density is to be found from gas dynamical equations rather than from the hydrostatic balance condition .",
    "in the previous section , we argued that the time - dependent x - ray illumination of accretion disks needs to be studied with a code that performs radiation transfer , ionization and energy balance calculations and also computes the dynamics of the gas .",
    "we are not aware of the existence of a code that would include treatments of all of these processes to the level of details needed for fe k@xmath0  line reverberation problem .",
    "however , we can use the static x - ray illumination code described by nayakshin , kazanas & kallman ( 2000 ) , which is appropriate for equilibrium situations , to make certain tests that can give us a rough idea of when time - dependence is important and what kind of spectral changes are to be expected .    the tests that we will perform are of two types . in the first one , we study situations in which x - ray flux was at one ( static ) luminosity state which we will label ( i ) for time @xmath68 , and then switched abruptly to a new state ( j ) at @xmath23 and remained at this state indefinitely ( i , j here are either 1 or 2 ) . using the static nkk code",
    ", we can compute the reflected spectra and the gas density profiles for the states ( i ) and ( j ) .",
    "in addition , according to ",
    "[ sect : tscales ] , at time @xmath69 we can compute the reflected spectra under the assumption that the gas density profile is still the same as it was in the state ( i ) , but with the new value for the illuminating flux .",
    "we will call this state ( ij ) as it corresponds to the transition from state ( i ) to ( j ) .",
    "it is clearly important to examine whether reflected spectrum ( ij ) differs from that of states ( i ) and ( j ) .",
    "the second type of tests that we will perform are less rigorous in the mathematical sense but are not less interesting due to their implications .",
    "in particular , we shall build a toy model for the time evolution of the gas density in the illuminated slab when the x - ray flux is variable .    here and later in the paper",
    ", we choose the geometry of the lamppost model , in which the x - ray source with luminosity @xmath70 is on the symmetry axis above the plane of the accretion disk at height @xmath71 .",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate through the shakura - sunyaev disk is @xmath72 .",
    "the illuminating x - ray spectrum is a power - law with photon spectral index @xmath73 extending to @xmath74 kev .",
    "we further assume that the state 1 produces x - ray luminosity equal to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the total thermal luminosity of the accretion disk .",
    "the state 2 is assumed to have @xmath77 .",
    "* flux increase .",
    "* figure [ fig : temp ] shows temperature profiles resulting from the calculation in which the initial state is ( 2 ) and the final state is ( 1 ) . the state ( 21 ) is defined to be the transient state which exists for @xmath78 after x - ray flux changed from the state ( 2 ) to ( 1 ) . immediately after the transition",
    ", the thomson thickness of the skin remains the same , but its temperature increases roughly by a factor of two , quickly adjusting to changes in the radiation field.ycki et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we set the temperature of the gas to be @xmath79 ev if xstar returns temperature below this value .",

    "figure [ fig : spectr21 ] shows equilibrium spectra ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and also the reflected spectrum of the transient state ( 21 ) , all for the nearly - face - on viewing angle around fe recombination band .",
    "note the decrease in the he - like component of the line in the spectrum ( 21 ) compared with that of state ( 2 ) .",
    "this is due to higher temperature of the skin which leads to correspondingly higher degree of ionization .",
    "the integrated equivalent width of the fe k@xmath0  line complex decreases from about 230 ev to 160 ev  a change of roughly 30% .",
    "a slightly different representation of the spectral shape of the reflected radiation is given in figure [ fig : ratio21 ] , where we plot the ratio of the reflected transient spectrum ( 21 ) to that of the equilibrium spectrum ( 2 ) at two angles , one nearly face - on and the other nearly edge - on .",
    "as already noted , the transient spectrum shows a deficit of the intermediate to highly ionized he - like lines when viewed face - on .",
    "viewed edge - on , it displays a lack of he- and h - like lines compared with equilibrium spectrum ( 2 ) .",
    "note also a reduction in the broad component of the line .",

    "transition ( 12 ) from the `` high '' luminosity state ( 1 ) to the `` low '' luminosity state ( 2 ) .",
    "the corresponding temperature profile is also shown in figure [ fig : temp ] .",
    "it is notable that in the `` transient region ''  the region with the thomson depth @xmath83  the state ( 12 ) actually occupies the solutions that are thermally unstable , ",
    "i.e. , they are positioned below the point ( c ) on the corresponding s - curve ( see fig . 1 in nkk ) .",
    "these solutions are allowed , however , during the transition because the pressure balance is not obeyed and the gas density is basically fixed ( on short time scales ) . at a fixed density , the thermal ionization instability does not operate ( see krolik et al .",
    "1981 and field 1965 ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig : spectr12 ] ) displays the transient spectrum ( 12 ) along with the equilibrium spectra for comparison , while figure ( [ fig : spectr12b ] ) shows the same spectra but in a broader frequency range .",
    "clearly , the transient region yields significant column depths in species from fexvii to the completely ionized fexxvii . the line emission from `` intermediate '' ionization stages , fexvii to fexxiii , and the compton down - scattered he - like line , fills in ( somewhat ) the gap between the neutral - like component of the line ( that comes from the material beneath the ionized skin ) and the he - like component .    however , the most striking out - of - equilibrium effect is the increase in the he - like component of fe k@xmath0  line .",
    "it is the change in the emissivity of this feature that fuels the increase in the overall ew of the line from 185 ev to 341 ev ",
    "an increase of about 90% . clearly , an effect of such a large magnitude is observationally significant . also , the changes in the soft x - ray band are even more pronounced ( figure [ fig : spectr12b ] ) .",
    "variability in this energy range is driven by variations in the ionization state of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and fe l lines .",
    "both figures indicate that , as with the transition ( 21 ) , the continuum reflected spectrum ( 12 ) is also different from either of the two equilibrium reflected spectra .      as we discussed above , in time - dependent situations , the reprocessing gas density ( at each point of the slab ) is to be determined from the associated gas dynamics , preferably using a gas - dynamical code .",
    "in the absence of such a code , we will use the following simple prescription : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the `` equilibrium '' state density profile of the illuminated gas [ for example , if we are studying the ( 12 ) transition , then @xmath86 $ ] . note that @xmath87 is a function of the thomson depth ( as opposed to a constant ) , which ensures that the correct hydrostatic balance - based solution is reached at @xmath88 .",
    "while equation ( [ doft ] ) is admittedly ad - hoc , it mimics several important properties of the density evolution that we expect .",
    "namely , at times @xmath78 , the gas density profile is close to that of the initial state ; at times @xmath89 , @xmath90 ; at intermediate times @xmath91 the density profile is a mixture of the initial and final states .",
    "in addition , the re - adjustment of the gas density occurs on roughly correct time scales . we plan to calculate the gas dynamics explicitly in our future studies .",
    "nayakshin & kallman ( 2001 ) have shown that the ionization state of the skin and the reflected spectrum are strongly affected by the ratio of the incident x - ray flux , @xmath6 , to the disk flux , @xmath10 .",

    "note that even at @xmath99 , the temperature and the density profiles still have not reached the `` final '' equilibrium state . in the `` transient '' region ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath100 , temperature evolves from the cold branch through all the intermediate values to the hot branch . as discussed in ",

    "[ fig : temp21 t ] , we observe that at @xmath103 , the cold layers below the ionized skin are relatively unaffected .",
    "though in part this is due to the simplified treatment of the cold branch of the solution ( as described in the footnote to  [ sect : immed ] ) , we believe this is a general result because the cooling of the cold branch is done mostly through optically thick processes , and hence the cooling function there depends very strongly and non - linearly on temperature . a change in the x - ray flux of the order of 2 will cause only a slight change in the temperature of this region , contrary to the highly ionized skin ( where the cooling function depends on the temperature in an approximately linear fashion ) . in addition , the gas temperature must increase to about @xmath104 ev , that is about 10 times from its initial value of @xmath105 ev , in order for the iron to become sufficiently ionized to permit fexvii and higher ionization species to become dominant line emitters .",
    "therefore , the line emission from this cold region  the neutral - like component at @xmath106 kev  evolves very slowly in the beginning of the calculation , as can be seen in panel ( b ) of figure ( [ fig : ew21 t ] ) . only at @xmath107 ,",
    "the transient region s density evolves enough to allow for a substantial warming up of that region and the associated decrease in the neutral - like fe k@xmath0  line emission .",
    "the evolution of the helium - like fe k@xmath0  component is dictated by the fact that at first the skin heats up due to the increase in the ionizing flux and therefore the emission from this component significantly decreases . at later times , when the transient region warms up , the he - like emission increases by as much as a factor of 4 .",
    "the hydrogen - like component at @xmath108 kev remains very weak and approximately constant during the entire interval , a fact due mostly to the intrinsically low effective fluorescence yield of h - like fe . also note that at times @xmath109 , the soft x - ray band exibits many strong lines and recombination continua which we do not show here ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr12b ] ; in addition , animations of the temperature and spectral changes can be found at `` http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/serg/ '' ) .",
    "the second test we perform is for the same geometry , but for the ratio of @xmath110 in the state ( 1 ) , and the accretion rate @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding temperature profiles are presented in figure [ fig : temp21ht ] , while the ew of the line is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew21ht ] .",
    "the character of the temperature and spectral evolution during the transition is similar to that of the warm skin limit , except that the he - like line emission suffers even greater variations .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the skin in state ( 1 ) is completely ionized , which means that the he - like line emissivity evolves from virtually zero to being the dominant component and then decaying as the skin approaches the new ( hot ) state ( 2 ) .",
    "our main results can be summarized as following .    * ( 1 ) * the gas hydrodynamical time , @xmath50 , is an important relaxation time scale of the x - ray reverberation problem .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption fails for variations with characteristic time scale @xmath112 .",
    "as shown , this will in general affect the reflected spectra , unless the thomson depth of the ionized skin is much smaller than unity .    to make this point clearer , we plot ( figure [ fig : fline21 t ] ) the time profile of the illuminating flux ( in slab geometry ) and the line emissivity in normalized units for the simulation presented in  [ sect : warm ] .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the line flux responded to the change in the illuminating flux only after a delay @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that the slow evolution of the fe k@xmath0  line emissivity , caused by the evolution of the ionization state of the reflector , might be mis - interpreted as being due to the specific geometric arrangement or the presence of general - relativistic effects .",
    "we will discuss this point a little further in ",
    "[ sect : impl ] .    *",
    "( 2 ) * if the illuminating flux fluctuates on time scales @xmath113 , the resulting spectra can be computed in the quasi - static approximation ( e.g. , nkk ) .",
    "effectively , this is the limit in which all of the ionized x - ray reflection calculations ( of which we are aware ) were performed to date .    *",
    "( 3 ) * in the opposite case , @xmath114 , the ionized disk is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and the reflected spectra can be significantly different from that obtained under the quasi - static assumption .",
    "in particular , the fe k@xmath0  line emissivity is _ not _ a function of the instanteneous x - ray flux that would have been implied from the hydrostatic models of nkk .",
    "the thomson depth of the skin is approximately that appropriate for the time - averaged x - ray flux , but the transition from highly to weakly ionized layers is not sharp and time - steady as in the models of nkk .",
    "the time - averaged reflected spectra are _ not _ the same as quasi - static reflected spectra computed for the average incident flux .",
    "this is not surprising if one considers that the response of the disk to the ionizing radiation is a strongly non - linear process driven by the tii .",
    "the observed response depends not only on the frequency of variation but also on the initial conditions of the reprocessing matter .",
    "consider , for example , a specific dependence between the x - ray flux and the line equivalent width under steady - state conditions depicted schematically by the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : draw1 ] ( for realistic examples see figure 1 of nayakshin 2000b ) . for fast flux variations , i.e. , those for which changes in @xmath6 occur on time scales shorter than @xmath50 ,",
    "one will , in general , observe different levels of fe k@xmath0  line flux if one arrives at the continuum flux corresponding to point b starting from different initial points ( cf .",
    "b@xmath115 and c  b@xmath116 in the figure ) .",
    "in fact , since the flux variations disturb hydrostatic balance , one will not come back to the initial point on the curve even if the flux attain its original value ( see trajectory b ",
    "b@xmath117 ) .",
    "these curves will converge to the same value of the ordinate only if the x - ray flux did not change from its final value ( at point b ) for time scales much longer than @xmath50 .",
    "hence , on short time scales there is no `` correct '' value for the line flux at a given continuum level and therefore one could obtain no apparent correlation between these two quantities in a monitoring campaign , instead of the one expected on the basis of steady state calculations .",
    "this argument may provide an explanation for the results of the analysis of the fe k@xmath0  line variability of mcg 63015 by vaughan & edelson ( 2001 ) : these authors split the x - ray light curve of this object into bins of the rxte sampling period , i.e. of order of 6000 seconds .",
    "they found ( see their figure 3 ) that the fe k@xmath0  line flux was variable on time scales of a few rxte orbits , but it was _ not _ correlated with the continuum flux in any consistent manner .",
    "the parameters associated with this object are roughly consistent with those needed for an explanation of these results as due to the finite value of @xmath50 . demanding the value of the latter to be @xmath118 sec and assuming a `` reasonable '' value of @xmath119 , one obtains ( eq . [ td ] ) for the mass : @xmath120 .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity of mcg 63015 is @xmath121 erg s@xmath47 ( e.g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , implying an accretion rate of a few percent or more . following the results of nayashin & kallman ( 2001 )",
    "it is expected that the thomson depth of the ionized skin would be sufficiently large to make the out - of - equilibrium effects significant .",
    "finally , one should bear in mind that the fe k@xmath0  line emissivity of an _",
    "ionized _ reflector is a function of the total radiation continuum seen by the reflector and not just the @xmath122 kev part of it typically picked by observers .",
    "in fact for spectra with @xmath123 the @xmath124 kev part of the spectrum contains most of the x - ray luminosity and thus determines the depth of the ionized skin .",
    "thus , fe k@xmath0  line flux and @xmath125 do _ not _ have to be directly related even in the quasi - static case .",
    "variations in this ( unobserved ) part of the spectrum ( see eq . 1 and the appendix ) might of course be invoked for a more prosaic explanation of the results of vaughan & edelson ( 2001 ) .",
    "the question of immediate interest following the discussion above is the potential impact of the non - equilibrium effects on the future fe k@xmath0  line reverberation campaigns ( e.g. , see young & reynolds 2000 ) .",
    "the thomson depth of the skin is much smaller than unity in the lamppost geometry if @xmath126 , and then the ionized layer is not important altogether .",
    "many agn are brighter than this , possibly , and for these the non - equilibrium effects ought to be important .",
    "however , the calculations presented above are purely local , considering the response of only a small region of the disk in slab geometry .",
    "more work is needed to determine whether the _ local _ effects will affect the reflected signatures of a full disk .",
    "while this complicates the theory of fe k@xmath0  line reverberation , we should not forget that with that there comes a new tool ( beyond static models ) to distinguish between models of different geometric arrangements on the basis of the responce of the reflected spectra to the continuum .",
    "conceptually the simplest model is that with the lamppost geometry .",
    "the x - ray source is stationary and it is the fe k@xmath0  line `` echo '' from different parts of the disk that determines the reflected line profile .",
    "an alternative arrangement is that of magnetic flares ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ) . in this geometry",
    "the observed @xmath127 is the aggregate of the emission of a large number of flares that take part in keplerian rotation of the disk . because of the rather limited extent of magnetic structures on the disk , one expects the fe k@xmath0  line features to be rather narrow and oscillate in energy space with the keplerian frequency ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ; ruszkowski 2000 ) , properties which may allow future observations of higher energy and time resolution to distinguish them in the x - ray light curves .",
    "as long as the narrow features are distinguishable in the spectrum , their magnitudes do not matter in the analysis of the trajectories of the emitting spots , and this is why the complications with the non - equilibrium effects may be circumvented .      at this point",
    "one should note that the power density spectra of agn as well as those of gbhcs are power laws which cover a large number of decades in fourier frequency . in agn specifically , they extend to very low frequencies ( @xmath128hz ; edelson & nandra 1999 ) , much lower than the characteristic time scales discussed in section [ sect : tscales ] ; therefore , one would expect at some frequency the transition from the @xmath129 to the @xmath130 regime , with the concommitant change in the correlative properties between the continuum and the fe k@xmath0  line .",
    "perhaps the most efficient way of studying these effects is to implement , when appropriate , the frequency resolved spectroscopy method employed by revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov ( 1999 ) in the spectro - temporal analyis of the data of cyg x-1 and compare the results to models which incorporate the above discussed processes . in applying their method to the hard state of cyg",
    "x-1 , revnivtsev et al ( 1999 ) found that the fe k@xmath0  line and reflection features appear to weaken with increasing in fourier frequency .",
    "in particular , these features drop to about half of their value at a frequency @xmath131 hz , and continue to decline to the highest frequencies probed by their analysis ( @xmath132 hz ) .",
    "our models predict that the one - to - one correlation between the x - ray flux and the fe k@xmath0  line flux may be broken on short time scales .",
    "they do _ not _ predict a decrease in the variability of fe k@xmath0  line with increasing frequency as such , so the lamppost - like models do not seem to offer any physical explanation for results of revnivtsev et al ( 2000 ) .    at the same time , note that the observations also show that the x - ray continuum slope decreases with increasing frequency from about @xmath133 , for frequencies below @xmath134 hz , to @xmath135 for @xmath132 hz .",
    "this is significant , because as shown by nkk , done & nayakshin ( 2001 ) , ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with other things being equal , a steepening in the x - ray spectrum lowers the thomson depth of the skin and its degree of ionization .",
    "in particular , when the x - ray spectrum is hard depends on @xmath15 as explained in the appendix , but for cyg  x-1 the cutoff energy is quite high in the hard state , i.e. , @xmath136 kev ] , i.e. , @xmath137 , the skin is nearly completely ionized so it supresses all the reflection signatures . for @xmath138 ,",
    "the skin contains a non - negligible amount of he - like iron , and then the line can not be completely suppressed , no matter how high the ionizing flux is .",
    "these facts incorporated in the observations of revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 1999 ) might hence provide an account for the corresponding behavior of the fe k@xmath0  line behavior observed within the framework of the models of nkk , nk and done & nayakshin ( 2001 ) .",
    "clearly the regions processing hard flux should be geometrically distinct from those processing softer flux , which is possible only if these fluxes result from different x - ray sources ( e.g. , magnetic flares ) .",
    "however , a more definitive statement along these lines will have to await the development of more detailed models .",
    "we performed a first , highly simplified , calculation of time - dependent spectra due to x - ray reprocessing on the surface of an accretion disk , assuming a step function variation in the incident x - ray flux and limiting ourselves to their effects on a limited section of the accretion disk which we have treated in the slab approximation . while our treatment of the hydrodynamic response of the photoionized gas density profile to changes in the x - ray flux is admittedly very simple , we nonetheless expect that our _ qualitative _ conclusions will hold in a more sophisticated calculation .",
    "we found that the time necessary for establishing hydrostatic balance in the x - ray heated skin of the disk is an important relaxation time scale of the problem .",
    "furhtermore , because of the non - linear nature of the optically thick ionized x - ray reflection problem , the `` relaxation '' process allows for entirely new physical solutions at transient times , absent in the steady - state solutions .",
    "one of the new interesting features is the presence of a strong he - like component at @xmath101 kev of the fe k@xmath0  line during a transition from an initial neutral - like to the final neutral - like spectrum .    because of the presence of this relaxation time scale , under time - dependent conditions",
    ", the reflected spectrum is _ not _ a function of the instantaneous illuminating flux or other system parameters and depends on the history of variations of these parameters .",
    "this fact may provide an explanation for the recent analysis of time - dependent reflection data for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by vaughan and edelson ( 2001 ) .",
    "it is also important to note that , because of the non - linear character of the formation of the ionized skin on the surface of the accretion disk , as indicated by our results , the _ time - integrated _ spectra of real sources may not always be modelled as static spectra corresponding to the average x - ray luminosity during the observation .",
    "while a definitive asnwer of the effects described above within the specific models should await further more detailed investigations , as argued in section [ sect : impl ] they can be important for the for the _ lamppost models _ of fe k@xmath0  line reverberation of agn once x - ray luminosity of the source exceeds a percent or so of the eddington luminosity . their importance in other such models e.g. the flare models of ruszkowski ( 2000 ) and nayakshin & kazanas ( 2001 ) is harder to assess because of the additional details that will have to be specified to completely determine these models . nonetheless , for any given model , these effects are well defined and their incorporation in the analysis of future observations of higher time and energy resolution should provide additional means for discriminating between the various models and hence contribute to probing the physics of accretion in the vicinity of compact objects .",
    "sn acknowledges support from the national research council during the bulk of the time devoted to this project .",
    "the authors are very grateful to tim kallman , chris reynolds and mitch begelman for discussions and useful comments that improved this paper .",
    "the importance of the high energy rollover in the spectrum was discussed by nayakshin & kallman ( 2001 ) , but no quantitative tests were presented . therefore , using the code of nkk , we perform here several tests that validate listing @xmath15 as a major unknown . for simplicity , we choose the geometry of the lamppost model with @xmath71 and @xmath139 .",
    "the illuminating x - ray spectrum is a power - law with photon spectral index @xmath73 .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_cut ] shows the temperature profiles for the illuminated gas for three different shapes of the high energy cutoff .",
    "the solid curve shows the reflected spectrum for the case of a sharp cutoff at @xmath140 kev , whereas the dotted and the dashed correspond to tests with an exponential roll - over at @xmath141 and @xmath142 kev , respectively .",
    "the main effects in the evolution of the temperature profiles , from the sharply cut to the @xmath143 kev curve , seem to be    note ( 1 ) the decrease in the gas temperature on the top of the skin ; ( 2 ) an appearance and increase in the extent of the `` mid - temperature '' step at @xmath144 as @xmath15 decreases .",
    "the physical mechanism behind the changes in the temperature profiles and the reflected spectra is the change in the photo - ionization equilibrium curve  the so - called `` s - curve '' ( see , e.g. , krolik et al .",
    "1981 ; fig . 1 in nkk ) .",
    "as shown by nayakshin ( 2000a ) , the transition between the hot and the cold parts of the ionized gas occurs at the gas pressure @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the compton temperature of the local radiation field , and @xmath147 is the local radiation energy density .",
    "as the high energy cuttoff @xmath15 decreases , @xmath148 decreases as well , and this is why there is somewhat less of the ionized skin and it is also cooler for smaller @xmath15 rather than @xmath15 . ] .",
    "figure [ fig : cut1 ] shows the reflected spectra at the inclination angle @xmath149 ( @xmath150 corresponds to the normal to the disk ) . the fe k@xmath0  line ew changes from about 82 ev to more than 200 ev .",
    "clearly , the variations in the spectra induced by the changes in the cutoff shape are large and non - trivial , and therefore the exact value of @xmath15 is indeed important in the determination of the fe k@xmath0  line emission from the disk ."
