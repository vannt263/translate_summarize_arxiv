    "subwavelength metal slits , as a kind of metal / insulator / metal waveguides , have attracted much attention in recent years not only because of their ability to guide light beyond the diffraction limit , but also because of several remarkable advantages , such as strong field localization , simplicity , and convenience for fabrication and integration into optical circuits [ 1 - 14 ] .",
    "when light ( infrared , visible spectrum ) propagates along a metal / air interface , it will excite a collective oscillation of free electrons at the surface of the metal , causing a field exponentially decaying away from the interface .",
    "this mode is called as surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) [ 2 - 6 ] . in a subwavelength metal / air / metal slit ,",
    "the case is somehow different , since the in - slit spp [ 5 ] wave decays exponentially in the metals and is flat in the air , which is the lowest eigenmode in the slit structure and the core part of the subwavelength metallic optics .",
    "step modulation is one of the key elements in photonic engineering that are employed in subwavelength metal structures to design and fabricate functional plasmonic devices , such as filters [ 7 - 10 ] , reflectors [ 11 ] , and photonic bandgap structures [ 11,12 ] . besides , the step modulation is of important theoretical significance since they are helpful for investigating spp scattering .",
    "had the knowledge and combined with the staircase approximation and transfer matrix technique , numerical results of more complicated structures can be obtained .    up to now , a number of methods have been used to calculate the spp scattering / transmission inside a step - modulated slit . the finite - difference time - domain method ( fdtd )",
    "is a well developed simulation method that provides relatively accurate results and has been considered as a standard for testing other theoretical methods [ 5 - 14 ] .",
    "the effective index method , on the other hand , is a simplified and direct theoretical method where only the spp modes are involved in the calculation , a method of one mode approximation ; however , this simplification causes the loss of the scattering information considerably and the numerical imprecision turned out to be considerable under some conditions [ 6 ] .",
    "et al_. presented a transmission model and gave a better description of the spp scattering using the characteristic impedance method [ 13 ] .",
    "et al_. [ 14 ] suggested an improved version of this method , which will be called as improved characteristic impedance method ( icim ) in this paper .",
    "et al_. presented a similar transmission model and used the scattering matrix method ( smm ) to calculate the transmission [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "although the calculated results from these two methods fit the fdtd results , two approximations , one mode approximation and quasi - statistic approximation , are used in the calculation , which limits their application scope and numerical precision , as will be discussed in sec . 3 below .",
    "recently , we successfully applied the modal expansion method ( mem ) in discussing the wave behavior inside a symmetric step - modulated slit [ 6 ] .",
    "this method did not involve the two mentioned approximations and provided more accurate results .    in this paper ,",
    "the mem is further improved so as to apply to the asymmetric modulated case in investigating the scattering / transmission mechanisms inside a step - modulated slit .",
    "a multi - mode multi - reflection model is proposed to explain the transmission process .",
    "a remarkable advantage of mem is that its precision is controllable .",
    "this enables us to discuss the preciseness of fdtd and icim by comparing the results from these methods and mem .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 sets our model of a step - modulated metal slit and presents the improved mem formulas . in sec . 3 ,",
    "the scattering in a junction structure is studied firstly as a prerequisite for later discussion , and then a multi - mode multi - reflection model is proposed to reveal the transmission mechanism in a step - modulated slit .",
    "comparisons between mem , fdtd , smm , and icim are also given in this section to highlight the restriction of the one mode approximation and quasi - statistic approximation .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we set the model of single - slit structure and present the formulas of the improved mem which is more practical and efficient compared with that in our previous work [ 6 ] .",
    "direction with perfectly conducting walls at 0 and @xmath0 @xmath1 m . a tm wave with wavelength @xmath2 is normally launched at @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4.,width=302 ]    the model structure is shown in fig .",
    "it is infinitely large in @xmath5 plane but confined in @xmath6 direction by perfectly conducting walls at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the structure is divided into three regions along @xmath6 direction , composed of silver / air / silver , and three layers along @xmath9 direction .",
    "the lower boundary of the @xmath10th layer is labeled as @xmath11 , and the interfaces between regions are by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the denotations @xmath14 and @xmath15 label layer height and slit width , respectively .",
    "a transverse magnetic ( tm ) wave , with magnetic field @xmath16 being in @xmath17 direction , is normally launched from @xmath3 in layer 1 and propagates upward .",
    "the structural parameters are given in the caption of fig .",
    "the dielectric constant of silver as a function of the wavelength of the incident wave @xmath2 is evaluated as @xmath18 by fitting the experimental data [ 15 ] , which is valid for @xmath19 @xmath1 m . in this paper , the wavelength is mainly set as @xmath20 @xmath1 m ; thus , @xmath21 .    in the remaining part of this section ,",
    "we suggest an improved version of the mem , which has the same output as the previous one [ 6 ] but is easier and faster .    the substance of mem is to expand the unknown functions ( electromagnetic field distribution in present case ) by a complete set of orthogonal functions .",
    "this makes the mem has two folds : one is the eigenvalue problem of the system ; the other is to establish and solve the coupled equations subject to boundary conditions .",
    "however , the choice of the complete set in modal expansion is not unique , but depends on the configuration of the system",
    ". it can be the eigenfunctions of a specific structure or other functions such as sine or exponential functions .    in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] , the fields in the given structure were handled by separation of variables .",
    "the factors containing @xmath6 variable were expanded by the eigenmodes @xmath22 between two perfectly conducting walls .",
    "the magnetic fields were expressed as @xmath23 , & & { q^{(0)}\\leq y < q^{(1)}}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\psi_{n}^{(2)}(x)\\left[e_{n}e^{ik_{yn}^{(2)}\\left(y - q^{(1)}\\right)}+f_{n}e^{-ik_{yn}^{(2)}\\left(y - q^{(2)}\\right)}\\right ] , & & { q^{(1)}\\leq y < q^{(2)}}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\psi_{n}^{(3)}(x)t_{n}e^{ik_{yn}^{(3)}\\left(y - q^{(2)}\\right ) } , & & { q^{(2)}\\leq y<\\infty , } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 were expansion coefficients which involved the scattering / transmission information of every eigenmode .",
    "it was inevitable to solve a transcendental equation in order to achieve the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "even with assistance of a powerful root - seeking method [ 16 ] , this procedure was still time - consuming .",
    "moreover , each layer had its own eigenfunctions . at an interface",
    ", it was required by the boundary conditions to calculate the overlap between the eigenfunctions at the two sides of the interface , called as coupling integrals .",
    "such integrals brought complexity to the program .    to avoid these difficulties , in this paper the factors containing @xmath6 variable",
    "were expanded by a sine basis subject to the perfectly conducting boundary condition .",
    "that is to say , the complete set @xmath29 is chosen as @xmath30 the eigenvalues @xmath31 are solely determined by the distance between the two perfectly conducting walls , independent of the positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so that is valid for all the three layers .",
    "correspondingly , the magnetic fields and its derivative in the three layers can be expressed as [ 17 ] @xmath32 , & & { q^{(0)}\\leq y < q^{(1)}}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\varphi_{n}(x)\\sum_{m}w_{n , m}^{(2)}\\left[e_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(2)}\\left(y - q^{(1)}\\right)}+f_{m}e^{-ik_{ym}^{(2)}\\left(y - q^{(2)}\\right)}\\right ] , & & { q^{(1)}\\leq y < q^{(2)}}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\varphi_{n}(x)\\sum_{m}w_{n , m}^{(3)}t_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(3)}\\left(y - q^{(2)}\\right ) } , & & { q^{(2)}\\leq y<\\infty , } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the expansion coefficients .",
    "the insertions of eq .",
    "( 3 ) into helmholtz equation yields an eigenvalue problem in each layer expressed by @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , and the operator @xmath41 being [ 18 ] @xmath42^{-1}\\left\\{k_{0}^{2}[i]+[k]\\left[e^{(l)}\\right]^{-1}[k]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath43_{mn}=\\int_{0}^{l}\\varphi_{m}(x)\\varphi_{n}(x)/\\varepsilon^{(l)}(x)dx\\\\ \\left[e^{(l)}\\right]_{mn}=\\int_{0}^{l}\\varphi_{m}(x)\\varphi_{n}(x)\\varepsilon^{(l)}(x)dx\\\\ \\left[k\\right]_{mn}=\\int_{0}^{l}\\varphi_{m}(x)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\varphi_{n}(x)dx\\\\ \\left[i\\right]_{mn}=\\delta_{mn}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in these equations , @xmath44 $ ] denotes a @xmath45 matrix where @xmath46 is the truncation number , and @xmath47 is the wave vector in vacuum .    here",
    "we mention the two advantages of the sine expansion in @xmath6 direction .",
    "one is that the eigenvalue problem , eq .",
    "( 4 ) , is very easy for computer implementation , which avoids the cumbersome solution - seeking procedure necessary in the eigenmode expansion [ 6 ] .",
    "the other is that the complete set of sine functions are the same for all layers , so that the coupling integrals at the interfaces become quite simple .",
    "these two advantages make the calculation program greatly simplified .    corresponding to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the derivative of the magnetic field is expressed as @xmath48 , & & { q^{(0)}\\leq y < q^{(1)}}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\frac{\\varphi_{n}(x)}{\\varepsilon^{(2)}}\\sum_{m}w_{n , m}^{(2)}ik_{ym}^{(2)}\\left[e_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(2)}\\left(y - q^{(1)}\\right)}-f_{m}e^{-ik_{ym}^{(2)}\\left(y - q^{(2)}\\right)}\\right ] , & & { q^{(1)}\\leq y < q^{(2)}}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\frac{\\varphi_{n}(x)}{\\varepsilon^{(3)}}\\sum_{m}w_{n , m}^{(3)}ik_{ym}^{(3)}t_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(3)}\\left(y - q^{(2)}\\right ) } , & & { q^{(2)}\\leq y<\\infty , } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] applying the layer boundary conditions , we obtain the coupled equations as follows : @xmath49=\\sum_{m}w_{pm}^{(2)}\\left[e_{m}+f_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(2)}q^{(2)}}\\right]\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\tilde{e}_{pn}^{(1)}\\sum_{m}w_{nm}^{(1)}k_{ym}^{(1)}\\left[i_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(1)}q^{(1)}}-r_{m}\\right]=\\sum_{n}\\tilde{e}_{pn}^{(2)}\\sum_{m}w_{nm}^{(2)}k_{ym}^{(2)}\\left[e_{m}-f_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(2)}q^{(2)}}\\right]\\\\ \\sum_{m}w_{pm}^{(2)}\\left[e_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(2)}q^{(2)}}+f_{m}\\right]=\\sum_{m}w_{pm}^{(3)}t_{m}\\\\ \\sum_{n}\\tilde{e}_{pn}^{(2)}\\sum_{m}w_{nm}^{(2)}k_{ym}^{(2)}\\left[e_{m}e^{ik_{ym}^{(2)}q^{(2)}}-f_{m}\\right]=\\sum_{n}\\tilde{e}_{pn}^{(3)}\\sum_{m}w_{nm}^{(3)}k_{ym}^{(3)}t_{m } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    the incident coefficients @xmath33 are determined by the incident wave . in this paper , the incident wave is always a spp wave launched in layer 1 , namely , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , one naturally has @xmath51 which determines the coefficients @xmath33 . after setting the incident coefficients @xmath33 , the four groups of coefficients , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ,",
    "can be obtain from eq .",
    "( 7 ) . thus all the field quantities are obtained .    in this paper , we will focus on discussing the reflection / transmission mechanisms , which are mainly presented by the reflection coefficients @xmath25 and transmission coefficients @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for example",
    ", the amplitudes of the spp modes in layer 1 and 3 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are the reflection and transmission efficiencies of the system , and their arguments , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are the corresponding phase shifts . therefore , a projection between the fields calculated by eq .",
    "( 3 ) and the eigenmodes @xmath22 is implemented for obtaining the @xmath25 and @xmath28 . in the following , the absolute values of these coefficients may generally be named as excitation efficiency .",
    "thus we accomplish our formulation presentation .",
    "this method is briefly outlined as follows : the field is expanded by sine functions which are complete and uniform in all layers .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue problem becomes a matrix form as shown in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , which makes the calculation quite easy .",
    "accordingly , the procedure here is much more practical and efficient compared to the previous one [ 6 ] . at last , the overlaps between the calculated field and the eigenmodes in eq . ( 1 ) give the required reflection and transmission coefficients necessary for physical analysis .",
    "although we merely study the three - layer structure , our procedure developed here is easily applied to more complicated structures by implanting the s matrix algorithm [ 19 ] or the enhanced transmittance matrix approach [ 20 ] .",
    "in this section , we investigate the scattering / transmission mechanisms inside a step - modulated subwavelength metal slit .",
    "to do so , the scattering in a junction structure is first discussed in detail , since the slit comprises more than one junction structure .",
    "then we disclose the multi - mode multi - reflection model in the transmission process in the slit . by the way",
    ", the numerical precision of fdtd and icim is discussed by comparing results of these two methods and mem .    in calculation , the confinement is set as @xmath0 @xmath1 m .",
    "we have tested that @xmath56 modes , @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , are enough to give results with precision up to four significant digits .",
    "the convergence test for truncation number @xmath46 and the preciseness test for confined width @xmath58 will be carried out later in fig .",
    "a junction structure is the connection of two half - infinitely long slits with widths being denoted by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , which can be easily realized in fig . 1 by setting the height of layer 2 to @xmath61 .",
    "in ref . [ 6 ] , some scattering properties of symmetric structures have been revealed .",
    "for example , the main ingredient of the fields inside the slits were guided modes which played a very important role in scattering / transmission , and the unimportant components were the radiation modes excited which were necessary to fulfill boundary condition , but had little contribution to the transmission .",
    "so the following discussion will focus on the guided modes .",
    "however , the discussion in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] was limited to the symmetric case . here",
    "we present a detailed investigation on how the scattering is affected by asymmetry .",
    "two types of structural changes are considered . in type",
    "i , the widths of the two slits are fixed and the position of the narrower one can be anywhere between left to right , as shown in the inner panel of figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) . in type ii ,",

    "the eigenmodes in the narrower and wider slits are denoted by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . in figs .",
    "2(e ) and ( f ) , the lowest modes @xmath70 and @xmath71 , plotted by the black curves , are just spp modes , and the second modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 , plotted by the red curves , are of actually antisymmetric wave functions within the slits . note that the curve of @xmath74 is divided into three parts by two zeros .",
    "the sign of the central part of @xmath75 is contrary to the other parts .",
    "we notice that under our present parameters , only the first two eigenmodes of the narrower slit @xmath70 and @xmath72 are within the slit ( guided modes ) , see the black and red lines in fig .",
    "the wave functions of the higher modes mainly distribute within the metal ( radiation modes ) , see , as an example , the third mode @xmath76 in fig .",
    "the behavior of @xmath77 with the position of the narrower slit has to be explicitly given as following .",
    "when the slit moves rightwards , the width of metal at the right side of the slit becomes thinner , so that the hill is compressed .",
    "if the narrower slit is on the right side of the center position @xmath78 @xmath1 m , the hill will appear at the left side of the slit . while if the slit is just at or very near the center @xmath78 @xmath1 m , there will be two hills at the two sides of the slit , respectively , since the structure in this case is symmetric [ 6 ] .",
    "three obvious features of excitation efficiencies can be seen in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the first is that all the curves there exhibit a central symmetry , because all the configurations are symmetric with respect to the central line at @xmath78 @xmath1 m .",
    "the second is , from comparison of the black and red solid lines in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) , that the excitation efficiencies of the spp modes in narrow slits are much larger than those of the second modes .",
    "the third is , by inspection of dash - dotted lines in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) , that the shapes of the efficiency curves of the modes in wider slits resemble their eigenfunctions @xmath79 in fig .",
    "the latter two features can be attributed to the treatment of mem which involves a mutual expansion between the modes in different layers .",
    "we should keep in mind that the total field at the layer boundary , @xmath80 , can be respectively achieved by the linear combination of eigenfunctions in the narrower and wider slit , and the expansion coefficients depend on the position of the narrower slit , subject to boundary conditions .",
    "then , the curves in figs . 2(a ) and ( c ) can be explained qualitatively .",
    "we first see the case where the wave is incident from the narrower slit to wider one , as shown by the inset in fig .",
    "2(a ) . for reflected waves , the reflection efficiencies @xmath52 are proportional to the projection @xmath81 where the integration is along the interface between the narrower and wider slits .",
    "since the eigenfunctions in the wider slit or their combination , @xmath80 , can be seen as a smooth variation within the range of narrower slit , the reflection efficiency of the spp mode in the narrower slit , @xmath82 , is dominant because its eigenfunction is also smooth within the slit , and that @xmath83 is very small because the second mode is an antisymmetric function within the slit . for the transmitted waves , the transmission efficiencies @xmath53 are qualitatively determined by @xmath84 , which includes @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and so on .",
    "we have already known that the excitation of the second mode in the narrow slit is very small , so that the contribution of the factor @xmath86 is negligible .",
    "the contribution of the radiation modes is relatively complicated , but unimportant because what happened inside the slit is the key part of the scattering procedure ; while the radiation modes localized in metal are excited to fulfill the boundary condition outside the slit .",
    "that is why we try to avoid theses modes in the discussion . by several numerical tests ,",
    "it is sure that the radiation modes do have contribution to the transmitted waves but the contribution is comparatively small .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath88 mainly determines the transmission efficiencies @xmath53 . as an example , let us see the @xmath89 curve .",
    "@xmath90 , where @xmath70 is smooth within a narrow region , see , the black line in fig .",
    "when the narrower slit is positioned at the left side with its center being at @xmath91 @xmath1 m , @xmath74 has a maximum at this position .",
    "therefore the projection of @xmath70 onto @xmath75 is at a maximum .",
    "as the narrower slit moves rightwards , we image that the black curve in fig .",
    "2(e ) shifts rightwards . at @xmath92 @xmath1 m",
    ", @xmath74 is zero .",
    "accordingly , the projection of @xmath70 at this position onto @xmath75 , as well as @xmath89 , reaches zero . between @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath1 m , @xmath89 should drop from the maximum to zero .",
    "we notice that around the zero , the phase of @xmath93 changes nearly @xmath94 . at the other zero of @xmath74 at @xmath95 @xmath1 m",
    ", @xmath89 again reaches zero and its phase changes nearly @xmath94 once more .",
    "this analysis explains why the shape of @xmath89 is like to @xmath74 .",
    "it is the narrow and smooth profile of @xmath96 that causes the similarity of the curves between @xmath89 and @xmath74 curves .",
    "the @xmath97 curve in fig .",
    "2(a ) is understood in the same way .",
    "@xmath98 is mainly determined by @xmath99 , which is a smooth and relatively flat curve due to the smooth variations of both spp waves .",
    "we next see the case where a spp wave is incident from the wider slit to narrower one , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2(c ) , the incident wave being a smooth curve within the range of the wider slit width , see the black curve in fig .",
    "we again begin with the waves in narrower slit .",
    "@xmath53 is proportional to the integral @xmath81 , where @xmath80 is the combination of eigenfunctions in the wider slit and considered as a smooth varying curve within the range of the narrower slit , so that the transmission efficiency of the spp mode is dominant and much larger than that of the second mode .",
    "for the waves in the wilder slit , ignoring the contribution of the second mode and radiation modes , the reflection efficiencies @xmath52 is mainly determined by @xmath100 , leading to the fact that the @xmath52 curves in fig .",
    "2(c ) have similar shapes as @xmath53 curves in fig .",
    "2(a ) .    the transmission efficiency @xmath98 in fig .",
    "2(a ) is exactly the same as that in fig .",
    "2(c ) , and the efficiencies @xmath101 , @xmath97 and @xmath89 in fig .",
    "2(a ) have the same behavior as @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in fig .",
    "2(c ) , respectively , although with different values . the reflection efficiencies @xmath101 and @xmath102 in fig .",
    "2(c ) are higher than those in fig .",
    "this is because fig .",
    "2(c ) represents the case that wave incident from a wider slit to a narrower one , which needs to squeeze light into a narrower space , so the higher reflection is understandable .",
    "the variations of the scattering phase shifts for the above two different incident cases are plotted in fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( d ) .",

    "close to the turning point , @xmath98 reaches the minimum , and @xmath101 and @xmath97 reach the maximum .",
    "since the second mode in the wider slit @xmath113 now is an evanescent mode , the energy is mainly stored in the reflected spp wave .",
    "once @xmath113 becomes a propagation mode , it must gain a large portion of energy from the reflection due to its large excitation efficiency , and leads to the rapid drop of @xmath101 as shown in fig .",
    "at the same time , the dropping @xmath101 further causes a redistribution of excitation efficiencies by the boundary continuum condition .",
    "therefore , what behind the drastic changes of excitation efficiencies is a redistribution of energy between evanescent modes and propagation modes .",
    "the explanation of the energy redistribution is also suitable for the case where the wave is incident from the wider slit to narrower one .",
    "it is seen from figs .",
    "3(b ) and ( d ) that the phases of both @xmath104 in these two figures are also the same .",
    "at the turning point , @xmath104 changes its phase by @xmath94 .",
    "the change of @xmath94 in phase at the turning point also occurs for @xmath93 in figs .",
    "3(b ) and @xmath122 in figs .",
    "so far , the scattering mechanisms of the two types of structures are investigated .",
    "although the investigation here is restricted to the incident wave with wavelength @xmath20 @xmath1 m only , the analysis above is also applicable to the infrared and visible spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the analysis is important in practical application .",
    "for example , one can excite / suppress specific modes to control the field distribution inside a slit , or design high efficient reflector , by changing the position or width of the slit .",
    "having had the knowledge of the scattering of the interface in a single junction structure , we are ready in this subsection to discuss the transmission in a step - modulated slit which can be regarded as the combination of two junction structures . in order to reveal the transmission clearly , we present here an analysis of multi - mode multi - reflection model that combines wave and ray optics .",
    "figure 4 is the sketch of the multi - mode multi - reflection model . in a step - modulated subwavelength metal slit ,",
    "there are two interfaces at @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "let us discuss the wave reflection and transmission in the slit .",
    "when the incident spp launched from @xmath125 in layer 1 impinges the interface between layers 1 and 2 , @xmath123 , it generates the reflection wave in layer 1 and transmission wave in layer 2 .",
    "the latter continues going upwards , and when reaching other interface @xmath124 , yields reflection and transmission waves again .",
    "obviously , there occurs multi - reflection in layer 2 , shown by fig .",
    "4(a ) .        because the wave in each layer is the linear combination of the eigenmodes of the layer , each ray in fig .",
    "4(a ) can in fact be expanded by eigenmodes , except the primary incident light .",
    "for example , at the point a , the reflected wave contains all possible modes in layer 1 and the transmitted wave contains the modes in layer 2 .",
    "that is to say , the scattering excites all the modes in both layers .",
    "when all the possible modes in layer 2 reach point b , each mode again excites all possible eigenmodes in reflected wave in layer 2 and in transmitted wave in layer 3 .",
    "the phenomenon is termed as multi - mode excitation . to show the phenomenon explicitly ,",
    "we draw in fig .",
    "4(b ) the multi - mode excitation at point c. suppose that the waves in layers 1 and 2 are expanded by three eigenmodes , respectively .",
    "then when the three modes in layer 2 are incident to point c , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the first mode yields the reflected and transmitted waves , both containing three eigenmodes in respective layer , i.e. , the incident black line excites the black , red and blue lines in the transmitted waves in layer 1 and reflected waves in layer 2 , respectively . in the same way ,",
    "the incident red line also excites the black , red and blue lines in the transmitted waves in layers 1 and reflected waves in layer 2 , respectively , and so does the incident blue line .",
    "therefore , the total reflected wave at point c includes three eigenmodes in layer 2 , each being in turn the superposition of the reflections from the three incident eigenmodes .",
    "similarly , the total transmitted wave at point c includes three eigenmodes in layer 1 , each being in turn the superposition of the transmissions from the three incident eigenmodes .    in summary , the total transmission and reflection coefficients in layer 3 and layer 1 in fig .",
    "4(a ) are obtained by summing up all the single - scattered coefficients , respectively .",
    "in addition , it is worth mentioning that the multi - mode multi - reflection model is a generalized form of the single - mode multi - reflection model which occurs in a f - p cavity .",
    "the former will be simplified to be the latter if only one mode can be excited .",
    "the physical explanation of the multi - mode multi - reflection process is named as model analysis . in order to testify this analysis , numerical calculation based on this physical picture",
    "is carried out and the results are compared with mem . in fig .",
    "5 plotted are the transmission efficiencies as a function of the length of layer 2 @xmath126 when the incident wave is spp mode .",

    "while for @xmath132 @xmath1 m , crosses deviate from circles , indicating that the second mode should not be omitted since it does not fade out within this distance range . in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the crosses end at @xmath133 @xmath1 m , because below this distance the multi - reflection of the first two modes diverges .",
    "what is the reason of the divergence ?",
    "firstly , the divergence is not caused by the propagation mode since the multi - reflection of the spp mode always converges , as shown by the circles in fig .",
    "secondly , it is neither caused by the exponentially increasing term which originates from improperly handling the evanescent waves [ 20 ] for it occurs only at short distances . actually , the divergence arises from the coupling between the eigenmodes containing the evanescent modes . with the contribution of the evanescent wave , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the superposition will result in a larger transmission and reflection coefficients after each scattering if the second mode does not decay to a certain value .",
    "thus , there exists a critical distance above which the multi - mode multi - reflection analysis is applicable . for the structure given in fig .",
    "5(a ) , it is @xmath133 @xmath1 m .    to verify the above conclusion about the divergence of the evanescent mode",
    ", we suppress the antisymmetric second mode by reforming the slit structure to a symmetric one , as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) . then the circles and crosses are identical at any distance .",
    "let us see the contribution from the third mode .",
    "the plus signs including contributions from the first three modes are in good agreement with the results of mem as @xmath134 @xmath1 m .",
    "the crosses and circles are identical when @xmath126 is above @xmath135 @xmath1 m , but it is not so when @xmath126 is below @xmath135 @xmath1 m .",
    "that is to say , if the distance is less than @xmath135 @xmath1 m , the evanescent third mode is not negligible .",
    "this time the critical height for the third mode is @xmath136 @xmath1 m , which is much smaller than that of the second mode in the structure shown in fig .",
    "the reason is that the decay of the third mode is faster than that of the second mode , for the propagation constant @xmath109 of the former has a larger imaginary part than the latter , as shown in fig .",

    "5(b ) where the second mode in layer 2 is removed by structural change , it is also possible to suppress the third mode excited in layer 2 .",

    ", mem and other three methods , fdtd , smm , and icim , are discussed , and the calculated results of fdtd and icim are compared to the mem results .",
    "the preciseness of these methods is investigated and some useful conclusions are obtained . before presenting the numerical results , we would like to make a brief discussion about these four methods .",
    "fdtd , as a commonly used simulation method in optics , is to calculate field quantities directly from the maxwell s equations by difference method . in principle",
    ", this method and mem both can provide accurate and reliable results . here",
    "we would like to point out their three discrepancies .",
    "firstly , the way they solve the maxwell s equations is different : fdtd uses finite difference method to evolve fields in space and time domains , while the mem establishes and solves the coupled equations in frequency domain by the method of moments .",
    "secondly , the way they handle outmost boundaries is different : fdtd makes use of , for the outmost boundaries of a system , perfectly matched layers which can totally absorb waves without reflecting them back , while mem confines the structure with two perfectly conducting walls such as in this paper .",
    "the feasibility of the latter is due to the fast attenuation of light ( infrared , visible spectrum ) in a metal .",
    "if the confined width is large enough , the effects brought by the two perfectly conducting walls are negligible , as shown in fig 7(a ) below . although the perfectly matched layer technique can be introduced to mem [ 22 ] , it dramatically complicates the modal analysis .",
    "thirdly , the way they converge is different : the convergence of fdtd depends on the size of the yee cell used in simulation , while that of mem on confined width @xmath58 and truncation number @xmath46 .",
    "smm [ 7 - 9 ] and icim [ 13,14 ] are other two frequently used methods which show following three features .",
    "firstly , according to the two methods , the modulated region , layer 2 , would be divided into a central scattering region and a stub ( as shown in the fig . 2 in ref . [ 7 ] and fig . 4 in ref . [ 13 ] ) , and it would assume that the spp mode multi - reflection occurred in the stub ( although refs . [",

    "( 4 ) in ref . [ 13 ] and eq .",
    "( 8) in ref .",
    "secondly , both of them took the one mode approximation , which meant that only the spp modes existed in the stub and slits .",
    "thirdly , the phase shifts caused by scattering in the central scattering region could not be calculated properly , so that were ignored by means of the quasi - statistic approximation [ 23,13,14 ] ( although refs . [ 7 - 9 ] did not mention the quasi - statistic approximation , it was easily seen by the procedure of obtaining scattering matrix given in ref . [ 8 ] ) .    in the following",

    "8(a ) , the calculated results of mem can be approximately divided into three areas a , b , and c by dotted lines . in area",
    "a , a regular oscillating pattern is observed because when @xmath157 @xmath1 m only one spp mode propagates in layer 2 that forms the fp - like oscillation [ 5,6 ] . while in areas b and c where the higher modes also contribute to transmission",
    ", the transmission pattern becomes complicated .",
    "intuitively , there are two ways for higher modes to transport energy .",

    "the scattering in a juncture structure and the transmission inside a step - modulated slit are investigated .",
    "firstly , the scattering in a juncture structure is studied for two types of structural changes . for the type",
    "i change where the widths of the two slits are fixed and the position of the narrower one can be anywhere within the wider one , the excitation efficiencies of the modes in the wider slit resemble their eigenfunctions respectively , while in the narrower slit the excitation efficiency of the spp mode is dominant and much larger than that of the second mode . for the type ii change where the left walls of the slits are aligned and one slit becomes wider gradually , a wood - anomaly - like drastic change of excitation efficiencies is observed when the propagation property of one mode begins to transform .",
    "then , the transmission inside a step - modulated slit is studied .",
    "besides the mem calculation , we present explicitly a multi - mode multi - reflection model to reveal the transmission process .",
    "the multi - mode excitation and the superposition procedure of the scatterings from all possible modes are the key parts of the model , which represent the interference and energy transfer happened at layer boundaries .",
    "however , there exists a critical height of the modulated layer for applying the model due to the coupling between propagation modes and evanescent modes . above the critical height",
    ", the model can provide the same result as mem .",
    "in addition , some commonly used methods are compared with mem .",
    "useful conclusions about these methods are obtained : for a subwavelength metal slit , mem is a versatile and fast method that can provide accurate results ; fdtd has a relatively slow convergence and need very small yee cell to ensure the accuracy of the simulation ; icim incorporating the one mode and quasi - statistic approximations provides relatively accurate results when the incident wavelength is around 10 times larger than the stub width .",
