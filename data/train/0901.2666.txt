    "by means of atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers , several experimental groups have been able to control very precisely the force applied on proteins and nucleic acids .",
    "the observation of the unfolding behavior of these molecules under mechanical stress represents a powerful tool to recover structural properties of proteins and nucleic acids @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of small biomolecules , unfolding experiments represent an excellent test bed for a class of recently derived results , which go under the name of _ fluctuation relations _  @xcite .",
    "these relations connect the energy exchanged by thermodynamical systems with their environment to their equilibrium properties , and represent therefore an intriguing bridge between equilibrium and nonequilibrium .",
    "the case of small biomolecules under external force is interesting in itself , since the fluctuations of the energy exchanged by these systems are of the order of their average thermal energy , and they are therefore an example of microscopic out - of - equilibrium systems , with very large thermal fluctuations , whose study is one of the current topical problem in statistical mechanics @xcite .    as a force is applied on a biomolecule , and it progressively unfolds , the external pulling device performs thermodynamical work on it . by sampling this quantity over many repetitions of the unfolding experiments , and taking advantage of suitable fluctuations relations @xcite ,",
    "it has been possible to estimate experimentally the free energy difference between the folded and the unfolded state of a simple rna hairpin  @xcite and the free energy landscape of some proteins as a function of the molecular elongation  @xcite .",
    "convergence in such estimate is dominated by the so - called outliers , i.e. , rare values of the work that are much smaller than the average .",
    "the interest in the study of distribution functions of work performed on biomolecules during unzipping experiments and in particular of the distribution tails , is due to the need to estimate the frequency of the rare events that ensure validity of the fluctuation relations .",
    "the evaluation of the work probability distribution function ( pdf ) for a manipulated system requires in principle the solution of an evolution equation of complexity equivalent to the equation for the microscopic dynamics .",
    "since this equation involves a large number of degrees of freedom even for comparatively small systems like a polypeptide , it is customary to describe its dynamics by a small set of collective coordinates undergoing a brownian diffusion process  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that in their works , hummer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that if the molecular unfolding is described as a one dimensional diffusion process along a structured energy potential , the force - induced rupture rate exhibits a behaviour which is much more complex than the widely used approach based on the bell s formula . here",
    "we investigate the relation between the two levels of description on a simple model of a polypeptide unfolding experiment , and differently from @xcite , we focus on the description of the work distribution , rather than on the description of the unfolding rate .",
    "let us consider a system whose microscopic state is identified by the variable @xmath0 , where @xmath0 can also indicate a collection of microscopic coordinates , e.g. , the positions and momenta of the particles which make up the system .",
    "we shall assume that the system evolves according to a general dynamic process , parametrized by a parameter @xmath1 , which can be manipulated according to a fixed protocol @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution can be deterministic or stochastic , but we shall assume that , for any given value of @xmath1 , there is a well - defined equilibrium distribution that can be represented in the boltzmann - gibbs form @xmath3 a relation which _ defines _ the hamiltonian @xmath4 and the partition function @xmath5 .",
    "here @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the absolute temperature and @xmath8 boltzmann s constant .",
    "thus @xmath4 depends explicitly on the time only via @xmath2 .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath9 of the microscopic state @xmath0 evolves according to the liouville - like partial differential equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a linear differential operator , compatible with the equilibrium distribution of the system for any fixed value of @xmath1 : @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    the external manipulation of the system via @xmath1 leads to an energy exchange with the environment .",
    "according with the usual conventions in statistical mechanics ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the fluctuating work @xmath14 performed on the system , given the manipulation protocol @xmath2 and the microscopic trajectory @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 under these hypotheses , the time evolution of the joint pdf @xmath17 of the microscopic state @xmath0 and the total work @xmath14 performed on the system is governed by the partial differential equation @xcite @xmath18 in order to simplify the analysis , one evaluates the generating function @xmath19 of the distribution of @xmath14 , defined by @xmath20 so that eq .",
    "( [ eq_pdfw ] ) becomes @xmath21 this equation can be solved explicitly if the system is characterized by discrete states : in ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , an rna hairpin was modelled as a three - state system and the pdf of the work , done on the molecule by an external mechanical force , was evaluated numerically .",
    "one can evaluate the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_gen][eq_psi ] ) for real @xmath22 , starting from the initial condition @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "thus , since @xmath17 is real , we have @xmath25 , and we can restrict ourselves to the half - line @xmath26",
    ". then one can separate eqs .",
    "( [ eq_psi ] ) into two equations , one for the real part @xmath27 and one for the imaginary part @xmath28 of @xmath29 , obtaining @xmath30    once the function @xmath19 has been obtained , the joint pdf @xmath17 is given by the inverse fourier transform of @xmath19 .",
    "the unconstrained work pdf can be then evaluated from the relation @xmath31 .",
    "an important special case obtains when one considers a system described by few degrees of freedom , which is in contact with a large heat reservoir . in this case",

    "in an unfolding experiment , where a mechanical force is applied to one or both the free ends of a biopolymer , the work can be sampled by monitoring the extension of the molecules at different times @xcite .",
    "in this situation we face the following problem",
    ". equations ( [ eq_pdf ] ) , ( [ eq_pdfw ] ) and ( [ eq_psi ] ) describe the dynamics of a system at a very detailed , microscopic level . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the system is accessed only via the measurement of a few , and most often only one , observables , such as the elongation . moreover ,",
    "the microscopic `` liouville '' operator is not generally known with sufficient confidence . in any case , the explicit solution of the evolution equations becomes unfeasible as soon as more than a few degrees of freedom have to be considered .",
    "thus one considers descriptions of the system through some experimentally accessible collective coordinates . in the case of biopolymers ,",
    "one typically chooses the end - to - end length @xmath34 .",
    "its equilibrium distribution is determined by the effective free energy , defined by @xmath35 which plays the role of an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the dependence of this free energy on @xmath34 is the target of several experimental studies , performed by using a suitable fluctuation relation @xcite .",
    "it should be possible in principle to obtain the evolution for the collective coordinate pdf , and thus the work distribution , by projecting the microscopic `` liouville '' equations on the space spanned by the collective coordinates  @xcite .",
    "however , one would then in general obtain complicated non - markovian evolution equations , whose parameters will depend on unknown details of the underlying microscopic dynamics .",
    "in other words , even if eqs .",
    "( [ eq_pdf][eq_psi ] ) were exact , it would be hard to derive the explicit equations governing the time evolution of the pdf @xmath36 and the joint pdf @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in the present work , we make the following ansatz : we assume that the coordinate @xmath34 performs a brownian motion in an effective potential , which is given by the free energy landscape ( [ fel ] ) .",
    "this implies that the evolution operator @xmath11 for the coordinate @xmath34 is a fp operator of the form of eq .",
