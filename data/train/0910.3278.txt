    "cold molecules currently attract great attention due to their potential application for precision measurements  @xcite , quantum information schemes  @xcite , degenerate quantum gases with complex interactions  @xcite , and for cold chemistry  @xcite . besides the approach of forming cold molecules out of a sample of ultracold trapped atoms  @xcite , recent experimental efforts mainly focus on developing techniques of slowing or filtering , cooling , and trapping molecules produced in effusive or nozzle beams .",
    "well established techniques are buffer gas cooling @xcite , the deceleration of beams of polar molecules using time - varying electric fields  @xcite , as well as filtering of polar molecules out of an effusive source using static or time - varying electric fields  @xcite .",
    "recently , the method of decelerating supersonic molecular beams has been extended to magnetic  @xcite and optical fields  @xcite .",
    "alternative routes to producing cold molecules have been demonstrated utilizing the kinematics in elastically or reactively colliding molecular beams  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , producing beams of slow and cold atoms and molecules by mechanical means has been demonstrated  @xcite . in particular the technique of translating a supersonic jet to low longitudinal velocities by means of a rapidly counter - rotating nozzle , pioneered by gupta and herschbach ,",
    "holds the promise of producing cold , slow and intense beams of nearly any molecular species available as a gas at ambient temperatures  @xcite .",
    "attempts to improve the original arrangement have been made by the groups of h .- j .",
    "loesch in bielefeld and of m. dekieviet in heidelberg  @xcite . by controlling the sense and speed of rotation of the nozzle as well as by using the seeded beams technique , tunable beam velocities ranging from thousands down to a few tens of meters per second are feasible .",
    "typically , the translational and internal temperatures in the moving frame of the slowed beam are in the range of a few kelvin and a few tens of kelvin , respectively . due to the extremely simple concept",
    ", this technique can be realized by a relatively simple mechanical device .",
    "therefore this versatile source of cold molecules may be particularly useful for novel studies of molecular reaction dynamics at low collision energies in the gas phase or with surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the principle of operation relies on the galilei transformation of particle velocities in the moving frame of the rotating nozzle into the resting laboratory frame . as the nozzle moves backwards with respect to the molecular beam motion",
    "the beam velocity @xmath0 is reduced to @xmath1 . in this way ,",
    "gupta and herschbach succeeded in slowing beams of krypton ( kr ) and xenon down to 42 and 59 m / s , respectively , at beam temperatures down to 1.5 and 2.6 k , respectively  @xcite . in their prototype setup",
    "they used a tapered aluminium barrel with a hollow bore as a rotor .",
    "the special aluminum alloy was chosen for its favorable ratio of tensile strength to mass density , allowing high rotational speeds . however , machining such a rotor barrel requires considerable efforts .",
    "the gas injection was realized by inserting a polymer needle into the rotor .",
    "however , erosion of this type of sealing and the resulting gas leakage was found to be a serious limitation .",
    "the nozzle orifice was fabricated by gluing a stainless steel disk with a 0.1 mm aperture close to the tip of the rotor . in this case , swatting of slowly emerging molecules at high rotational speeds by the rotor arm as it comes back after one full revolution may be an issue . furthermore , a general drawback of producing slow beams using a moving source is the fact that the flux of molecules @xmath2 on the beam axis drops down sharply with decreasing laboratory beam velocity @xmath3 and with increasing distance @xmath4 of the detector from the nozzle , @xmath5 .",
    "this is a consequence of the beam spreading in transverse directions which becomes more and more important as @xmath3 decreases and hence the flight time goes up .",
    "the aim of the improved setup presented in this paper is to remedy the drawbacks mentioned above .",
    "schematic overview over the experimental arrangement used for characterizing the rotating nozzle molecular beam source.,width=226 ]    the experimental arrangement used for characterizing the new rotating nozzle setup is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the upper part represents the moving molecular beam source including a hollow rotor and a skimmer with 1 mm diameter .",
    "the nozzle chamber is pumped by an 8000l / s oil diffusion pump backed by roots and rotary vane pumps .",
    "typical background gas pressure during operation with argon ( ar ) at @xmath6bar nozzle pressure is @xmath7 mbar .",
    "the molecular beam follows a trajectory through the following elements : at a distance of about 20 mm behind the nozzle it enters an intermediate chamber through a skimmer with 1 mm opening diameter .",
    "the intermediate chamber is pumped by a 600l / s turbo pump providing a background gas pressure @xmath8 mbar during operation .",
    "the intermediate chamber is connected to a detector chamber pumped by a 150l / s turbo pump to maintain a background pressure @xmath9 mbar .    for the purpose of guiding beams of polar molecules , a set of four parallel steel rods is installed around the beam axis between the skimmer and a commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) ( pfeiffer qms200 ) which we use as a detector ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : guide ] ) .",
    "the mounting discs used for holding the rods also serve as apertures for differential pumping between the intermediate chamber and the detector chamber . the total fight distance from the nozzle to the detector",
    "amounts to @xmath10 cm .",
    "since the positions of the quadrupole guides and the qms detector can not be adjusted , the beam axis is initially aligned by sight by adjusting the position of the skimmer . for additional characterization of the beam ,",
    "a pitot tube is installed about @xmath11 mm behind the ionizer of the qms detector .",
    "it consists of a cylindrical chamber 4 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length having a conical aperture on the side close to the qms and a cold cathode ion gauge on the opposite side as an end cap .",
    "when a continuous molecular beam ( nozzle at rest ) is directed into the detector chamber , the residual gas pressure inside the pitot tube rises until equilibrium between incoming flux and outgoing flux of molecules effusing out of the pitot tube aperture according to its molecular flow conductance is reached .",
    "thus , from the difference between pressures inside the pitot tube and in the qms chamber , @xmath12 , the flux of molecules on the beam axis , @xmath2 , can be inferred according to @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote the area of the entrance channel into the pitot tube , a scaling parameter to account for the channel length , and the mean velocity of the molecules at ambient temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the on - axis beam density , which is obtained from the molecule flux using @xmath18 , is compared to the one determined by the qms signals in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "overview ( a ) and close - up views ( b , c ) of the experimental setup . ( a ) the nozzle orifice is mounted on one tip of the hollow rotor and produces molecule pulses along the beam axis each time it passes nearby the skimmer .",
    "the gas is injected into the rotor through a rotary feedthrough from below .",
    "the motor is mounted to a massive brass mount on top of the rotor , to which it is connected by a flexible coupler ( silicone tube ) .",
    "( b ) sectional view of the central part of the setup .",
    "( c ) close - up view of the rotor tip , which contains a bored thin - walled titanium ferrule as a nozzle.,width=264 ]    the experimental realization of our rotating source of cold atoms and molecules is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ( a ) .",
    "the following main modifications with respect to the work of gupta and herschbach have been implemented : the rotor is made of a thin carbon fiber ( cfk ) tube with 4 mm outer diameter and 38 cm in length .",
    "cfk is superior to any metallic material regarding the ratio of tensile strength to density by at least a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the small mass of the cfk tube makes it simpler to suppress deterioral mechanical vibrations that may occur due to slight imbalance of the rotor at high speeds of rotation .",
    "the cfk tube is sealed on both ends by gluing thin - walled ( 0.25 mm ) titanium grade 5 ferrules as end - caps into the inner surface of the cfk tube using special epoxy for cfk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ( c ) ) .",
    "one of the ferrules has a borehole @xmath20 mm in diameter at a distance of 0.5 mm from the closed end , thus forming a well defined nozzle aperture . a simple alternative that we also tried is capping the cfk tube by gluing circular pieces of capton foil to front and back sides of the tube .",
    "capping the cfk tube this way has proven to be stable enough to withstand the high centrifugal forces acting at rotational speeds up to @xmath21hz ( 21000 rpm ) .",
    "the nozzle orifice was fabricated by inserting a @xmath22 m wire half way in between the cfk front side and the capton foil prior to gluing .",
    "after the epoxy has hardened the wire is pulled out and an approximately 1 mm long channel remains .",
    "this method allows to easily realize small nozzle channels of diameters @xmath23 m , which limits the gas load and thus the required pumping speed .",
    "moreover , using this method of fabrication the distance of the nozzle from the tip of the rotor is kept minimum , thereby suppressing swatting of slow molecules by the rotor .",
    "however , the expansion out of a long nozzle channel is unfavorable compared to a thin - walled orifice as far as adiabatic cooling conditions are concerned . besides",
    ", nozzles fabricated using this procedure vary considerably with respect to length and shape of the nozzle channels . for all measurements presented in this work",
    ", bored thin - walled titanium ferrules are used .",
    "the cfk tube is inserted and glued into the core of the rotor consisting of an aluminium or brass cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the latter has a borehole along its axis for inserting the bored shaft of a rotary feedthrough from below and the shaft of a flexible coupler attached to a motor ( faulhaber-group.com ) from above . in order to avoid any imbalance it is important to perfectly align the motor axis and the feedthrough axis",
    "this is ensured by inserting the two axes into the same through - hole through the rotor core .",
    "the rotor including the metal core is first balanced statically by suspending the rotor core between two needles in the center of gravity and by abrading cfk material from the heavier side of the rotor until it is perfectly balanced . in a second step ,",
    "the rotor is dynamically balanced by adding screws to the rotor core at different places and by monitoring the vibration spectrum using acceleration sensors attached to the setup .",
    "using this procedure , vibrations at high rotation speeds resulting from the rotor are small compared to vibrations induced by the motor itself .",
    "therefore , additional masses are attached to the motor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ( b ) ) , which reduce vibrations at frequencies @xmath24hz .",
    "gas injection into the rotor is realized using a commercial rotary feedthrough sealed by ferrofluidic metal sealings .",
    "the bored shaft of the feedthrough is inserted into the rotor core and o - ring sealed .",
    "metal - sealed feedthroughs ( ferrotec.com ) features very high leak tightness ( @xmath25mbarl / s ) at low friction torque .",
    "the rotor axis is aligned with the motor axis by connecting the rotary feedthrough and the motor to a u - shaped brass construction .",
    "this brass mount is broken in two parts to introduce a rubber layer in between the two parts as a damping element for suppressing vibrations .",
    "the brass mount is fixed to a triangular massive metal plate supported by neoprene dampers . in our new setup ,",
    "the neoprene damper positioned underneath the skimmer resides on a vertical translation stage and the remaining two dampers reside on two horizontal translation stages .",
    "the translation stages are actuated by turning knobs outside of the vacuum chamber which allows full adjustment of the nozzle position with respect to the beam axis even during operation ( cf .",
    "[ fig : twopeaks ] ) .    in our present setup",
    "the maximum speed of rotation is limited to about 350hz ( 21000rpm ) .",
    "the limiting factor so far is mechanical vibrations , which rapidly increase in amplitude at frequencies @xmath26hz .",
    "the origin of these vibrations is presumably a slight unbalance of the rotor as well as vibrations caused by the motor .",
    "these vibrations are found to reduce the lifetime of the ferrofluidic sealings of the feedthrough , which is specified to rotation frequencies @xmath27hz ( 10000rpm ) .",
    "the motor as well as the cfk rotor , however , are able to withstand much higher frequencies up to 970 and 800hz , respectively .",
    "illustration of the dependence of measured signal ( right side ) on the alignment of the rotating nozzle setup with respect to the beam axis ( dotted line ) .",
    "( a ) proper nozzle alignment ; when the rotor is set to a perpendicular position with respect to the beam axis , nozzle and skimmer are in line with the beam axis up to the detector .",
    "( b ) nozzle shifted above the beam axis ; two pulses are produced each time the nozzle intersects the beam axis at two slightly tilted rotor positions .",
    "( c ) nozzle shifted below the beam axis ; one pulse is measured with reduced amplitude and width.,width=302 ]    although the expansion out of the rotating nozzle is continuous , the beam passing through the skimmer and entering the detector chamber is chopped .",
    "each time the nozzle comes close to the skimmer part of the ejected particles travel along trajectories that match the beam axis , determined by the positions of skimmer , quadrupole guides , and qms detector . using the vertical and horizontal translation stages",
    "the rotor position can be aligned during rotation of the nozzle to optimize the detector signal .",
    "a peculiarity of the rotating - nozzle arrangement is the fact that the signal traces as a function of time are changed in an asymmetric manner as the rotor is shifted horizontally across to the beam axis , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : twopeaks ] .",
    "the signal traces are recorded using ar gas expanding out of the nozzle at a nozzle pressure @xmath28 mbar and at a frequency of rotation of 10hz . at this rotation frequency , the flight time of ar atoms to the detector is short compared to the nozzle motion in front of the skimmer .",
    "thus , the recorded signal traces mainly reflect the effective slit opening function given by the skimmer with respect to the moving nozzle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : twopeaks ] ( a ) , the nozzle is properly aligned such that the signal trace features a slightly asymmetric trapezoidal shape . as the nozzle is moved across the beam axis by 2 mm , the measured signal splits into two maxima , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twopeaks ] ( b ) . in this geometry",
    ", particle trajectories matching the beam axis occur at two different angles of inclination of the rotor with respect to the beam axis .",

    "m/s the position of the maximum of the dependence @xmath130 shifts down to lower values of @xmath55 due to the fact that slow molecules spend more time inside the region of high rest - gas pressure and are therefore more sensitive to rest - gas collisions .",

    ", the relative velocity between colliding atoms is taken as @xmath132 , @xmath133 cm is the average flight distance from nozzle to skimmer , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the residual gas density and mean thermal velocity , respectively .",
    "the kr - kr collision cross section @xmath136 is varied as a free fit parameter , yielding an average value @xmath137 .",

    "circles depict the data measured using the quadrupole mass spectrometer scaled to densities obtained from the detector chamber pressure measured using a cold cathode pressure gauge .",
    "squares represent the density values obtained from the pitot tube measurement .",
    ", width=340 ]    high nozzle pressures , which lead to increased rest - gas pressure in the nozzle chamber , cause another unwanted effect to occur  the formation of a continuous effusive beam .",
    "the latter adds up to the pulsed nozzle beam and may have comparable beam intensities as the nozzle beam is decelerated to low speeds and low densities .",
    "we therefore compare the densities of nozzle beams and effusive beams by recording the detector signal with the nozzle standing properly aligned in front of the skimmer , on the one hand , and with the rotor being tilted completely out of the beam axis , on the other .",
    "the resulting density values are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : effusive ] .",
    "while the measurement using the pitot tube yields higher nozzle beam densities by a factor of 10 , equal densities are found for the effusive beam .",
    "thus , the nozzle beam is higher in density by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude than the effusive beam .    for decelerated beams of ar and kr ,",
    "however , equal densities of nozzle and effusive beams are reached at beam velocities @xmath141 and @xmath142 m/s , respectively . provided the expansion is operated in the supersonic regime , the ratio of nozzle and effusive beam densities is independent of the nozzle pressure @xmath55 .",
    "this ratio can be improved either by increasing the pumping speed in the nozzle chamber , which is characteristic for such an arrangement based on a continuous gas expansion .",
    "the effusive background can be further suppressed by implementing a mechanical velocity selector synchronized with the rotating nozzle .",
    "therefore , in the near future a chopper wheel will be placed behind the skimmer .",

    "the data recorded at 250hz are scaled up by a factor of 400 .",
    "signals shown as back lines are recorded with no voltage applied to the guide electrodes , light red lines are obtained at 3.5kv electrode voltage.,width=340 ]    the issue of transverse divergence of decelerated beams can be relieved for beams of polar molecules by implementing additional guiding elements using inhomogeneous electrostatic fields .",
    "this technique has been used in the past for focussing and even state selecting molecular beams for reactions dynamics experiments  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the technique has been used for guiding and trapping of cold polar molecules produced by stark deceleration or stark filtering  @xcite .    in our setup",
    "we have implemented an electrostatic quadrupole guide between the skimmer and the ionizer of the qms .",
    "it consists of four 259 mm long stainless steel rods 2 mm in diameter with a gap of 2 mm between two diagonally opposing rods . in a first experiment ,",
    "slow beams of fluoroform ( chf@xmath143 ) molecules have been produced by expanding chf@xmath143 either as a neat gas or seeded in kr out of the rotating nozzle .",
    "chf@xmath143 is a polar molecule with a permanent dipole moment of 1.65debye . since its mass ( @xmath144amu ) lies close to the mass of kr",
    "( @xmath145amu ) it can be efficiently cooled and decelerated by coexpansion with kr .",
    "when applying a high voltage @xmath146kv to a pair of opposing electrodes the qms detector signal clearly rises , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhancementtof ] . in these measurements ,",
    "chf@xmath143 is expanded at a nozzle pressure @xmath147 mbar at rotor frequencies 75 and 250hz , leading to most probable beam velocities @xmath148 and @xmath149 m/s , respectively .",
    "clearly , the enhancement of the qms signal at an electrode voltage @xmath146kv in proportion to the signal with no high voltage is higher at low beam velocities , reaching roughly a factor of 5 for @xmath149 m/s .",
    "great care was taken to suppress any direct influence of the electrode voltage on the ionization efficiency of the qms ionizer .",
    "similar experiments have also been performed with deuterated ammonia ( nd@xmath143 ) .",
    "in addition to increasing the beam intensity , the quadrupole fields act as quantum state selectors which filter out those states that are attracted towards the beam axis where the electric field amplitude is minimal ( low - field seeking states ) . provided",
    "the rotational temperature of the nd@xmath143 molecules is comparable to the translational one , _",
    "i.e. _ in the range of a few kelvin , we may expect to produce nd@xmath143 molecules in the state @xmath150 , @xmath151 with very high purity  @xcite .",
    "relative efficiency of guiding chf@xmath143 molecules at various beam velocities as a function of electrode voltage.,width=340 ]    interestingly , the dependence of the enhancement of peak density on the electrode voltage @xmath152 features a non - monotonic increase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhancementvoltage ] .",
    "a first local signal maximum is observed at electrode voltages between 200 and 500v , depending on beam velocity .",
    "we interpret this behavior in terms of two competing mechanisms being active : guiding of molecules in low - field seeking states enhances the detector signal whereas deviation of high - field seeking molecules away from the beam axis reduces the measured beam density . at low voltages @xmath153v , the guiding effect",
    "outreaches the deviation efficiency , leading to a local density maximum . as the electrode voltage rises ,",
    "all high - field seeking molecules are expelled out of the beam and only low - field seekers are guided to the detector .",
    "this guiding effect partly compensates the transverse blowing up of the beam , which is most relevant for low longitudinal beam velocities .",
    "consequently , the relative guiding efficiency increases up to a factor of 5 as the beam velocity is reduced down to @xmath149 m/s .",
    "the fact that the same qualitative behavior is observed with beams of nd@xmath143 supports our interpretation , which does not consider specific stark shifts of the molecules . in future efforts",
    "the transmission of our setup will be further studied both experimentally and using molecular trajectory simulations . besides",
    ", guiding of decelerated molecules around bent electrodes will be implemented to provide state - purified beams of cold molecules .",
    "this has the additional advantage of efficiently suppressing the hot effusive background .",
    "enhancement of the chf@xmath143 peak density as a function of beam velocity for fixed electrode voltage @xmath154kv.,width=340 ]    the dependence of the enhancement factor on the beam velocity is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhancementrot ] . in this measurement ,",
    "the electrode voltage is set to the maximum value @xmath146kv and the beam velocity is tuned from @xmath155 down to @xmath156 m/s by changing the frequency of rotation of the nozzle .",
    "further deceleration down to @xmath157 m/s is obtained by seeded expansion of chf@xmath143 in kr at a mixing ratio 1:2 .",
    "the enhancement factor continuously rises as the beam velocity is reduced , which highlights the potential of combining decelerated nozzle beams with electrostatic guiding fields .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a versatile apparatus that produces cold beams of accelerated or decelerated molecules based on a rapidly rotating nozzle .",
    "various technical improvements with respect to the original demonstration by gupta and herschbach  @xcite are introduced . in particular , gas injection into the rotor is now realized using a fluid metal - sealed rotary feedthrough which eliminates gas leakage into the vacuum chamber . using this setup , beam velocities well below @xmath129 m/s and longitudinal beam temperatures down to about",
    "1k are achieved .",
    "a detailed analytic model to simulate the measured density distributions as functions of flight time is presented .",
    "the fundamental drawback of this technique , the sharp drop of beam intensity at slow beam velocities , is relieved by combining the setup with electrostatic guiding elements , provided the molecules feature a suitable stark effect .",
    "moreover , stark guiding goes along with internal - state selectivity .",
    "thus , a significant increase of beam intensity as well as an expected high state - purity is achieved with beams of fluoroform and ammonia molecules .",
    "thanks to the technical improvements the rotating nozzle setup has evolved into a simple and reliable source of cold molecular beams with tunable velocity . in particular ,",
    "slow beams of molecules that are not amenable to efficient filtering or deceleration by means of the stark interaction with external electric fields can now be produced with high intensity . in the near future , we will utilize this beam source for studying reactive collisions between slow molecules and cold atoms produced by other means , _",
    "e.g. _ using a magneto - optical trap . at collision energies down to @xmath158mev",
    ", interesting new quantum effects may be expected in the reaction dynamics , _",
