    "a weakness of the analytical conditional mass function is its inability to distinguish individual substructures within a halo or to predict the masses of these substructures .",

    "we defined a central sub - halo to be the most massive substructure within an fof group , and other sub - halos within the group were classified as satellites .    during our age selection (",
    "described in [ agecat ] ) we found that some of the youngest dark matter halos exhibited rapid mass growth in the range of a factor of 10 - 1000 during one timestep ( approx .",

    "we believe this mass growth is unrealistic and is caused by misidentification of ownership of dark matter particles by the subfind algorithm between neighboring sub - halos .",

    "we use the infall mass because it gives a better representation of the current stellar component .",
    "unlike the dark matter particles that are disrupted during infall , the stellar component is deeper in the gravitational potential well and therefore is less likely to be disrupted during infall .",

    "all mass - based catalogs were chosen to reproduce the @xmath0 lae number density ( @xmath52 ) determined by @xcite , thus generating models with 3856 sub - halos in the ms - ii volume .    1 .   the mass limit criterion was selected to have a minimum mass of @xmath53 to match that inferred by ga07 from the observed clustering of @xmath54 laes .",
    "this approach is similar to the one used by @xcite ; their mass limit was chosen to reproduce the clustering of @xmath30 star - forming galaxies .",
    "we randomly selected 5.24% of these sub - halos to match the above number density .",
    "the mass limit catalog was designed to reproduce the observed correlation length of @xmath54 laes .",
    "the median catalog was selected using the median mass reported by ga07 , @xmath55 , as the catalog s median mass value .",
    "we expanded evenly around the median mass to obtain the observed lae number density , choosing halos with a range of @xmath56@xmath57 . as expected , this catalog and the mass limit catalog have similar median masses ; it should also reproduce the observed correlation length .",
    "3 .   the @xmath58 and @xmath59 catalogs were selected and named based on the @xmath60 uncertainty reported by ga07 in the observed lae median mass .",

    "figure [ tree2 ] shows an example merger tree showing the formation , assembly and merger ages assigned .",
    "ages are defined as the difference of lookback time chosen and the lookback time at @xmath0 .",
    "the three age definitions are as follows :    1 .   the _ formation age _ @xcite quantifies the timescale for mass growth of the most massive dark matter structure .",
    "it is assigned by finding the most recent timestep where the sub - halo mass of the most massive progenitor is less than half of the maximum mass in the entire merger tree .",
    "if this occurs between two timesteps , we linearly interpolate between these two to estimate the time when half the mass was accreted .",
    "2 .   the _ assembly age _",
    "@xcite measures when half the maximum mass of a galaxy is present in collapsed sub - halos even if they have not yet merged .",
    "this is assigned by finding the most recent timestep where the sum of progenitor sub - halo masses is less than half of the maximum mass in the entire merger tree .",
    "if this occurs between two timesteps , we linearly interpolate between these two to estimate the time when half the mass has assembled .",
    "because of these definitions , the assembly ages are always equal to or greater than the formation ages .",
    "figure [ agevage ] a ) shows the relation between formation and assembly ages .",
    "_ merger age _",
    "searches for the most recent major merger . our definition was designed to to use a main sub - halo to follow the major merger which is similar to the methods used by @xcite .",
    "we define a major merger to occur when two central sub - halos have a mass ratio of 3:1 or less in a timestep and the most massive halo within that timestep is involved .",
    "the major merger begins when one of the descendants in the next timestep is a satellite of the other descendant or both centrals merge into a single sub - halo . in figure [ tree2 ]",
    "we have two central sub - halos , around @xmath68 , where the lower mass central sub - halo descends into a satellite belonging to the descendant of the more massive central sub - halo .",
    "we track the descendants until the two sub - halos merge , possibly triggering star formation .",
    "we average the timestep of this sub - halo merger and the previous timestep to assign the merger time .",
    "the infall timescale from the beginning of the 3:1 merger of the two centrals to the final merger of their descendants is comparable to the dynamical friction timescale used by @xcite based on work from @xcite .",
    "figure [ agevage ] b ) & c ) show little to no correlation between merger age and assembly or formation ages .",
    "the age distributions are presented in figure [ agedist ] a ) .",
    "the lae mock catalogs are then created from the ages calculated for all halos with the mass limit criteria by selecting the 5.24% youngest and 5.24% closest to median aged sub - halos .",
    "see figure [ agedist ] b ) , c ) & d ) for age distributions for all halos and the age distributions of the selected catalogs . table [ model : age ] lists the age properties of the different catalogs with the bold values being age statistics used to select that particular catalog .",
    "all the median age - selected catalogs have median ages of @xmath69 . for star formation triggered by accretion of sub - halos in minor mergers , formation and assembly ages should roughly track the age of stars in a galaxy i.e. the population dominating its stellar mass ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since sed fits allow @xmath27 old populations to comprise the majority of stellar mass in laes ( ga07 ; @xcite ) , the median formation and assembly models are feasible models . however , because the merger age should track a young stellar population born in a starburst triggered by the major merger , we can not reconcile a @xmath27 median merger age with sed results ; this rules out the median merger model at high confidence .",
    "the young formation and assembly catalogs are viable models which have median ages of 240 myr , consistent with ages found for single - population models .",
    "the young merger catalog has a median age of 91 myr and is consistent with the observed age of the young stellar component .",
    "we used the naive estimator @xmath70 ( e.g. , @xcite ) to calculate the two point auto - correlation function ( 2pcf ) for the models .",
    "@xmath72 data - data pairs are unique pairs of sub - halos , from a catalog , that are separated and binned by radius @xmath73 .",
    "the simple geometry of the simulation , in conjunction with the periodic boundary conditions , allow us to use a geometrical formula for rr , which eliminates uncertainty in the estimator caused by binning random - random pairs .",
    "we applied a correction to our data abscissas to match the effective center of the radial bin using @xmath74 the correction was applied by our fitting algorithm to shift the data point to the radius which corresponds to the average value of the bin .",

    "we confirm that correlation lengths increase with median mass in our mass - based catalogs for both fixed @xmath82 and when @xmath80 is allowed to be a free parameter .",
    "the median and mass limit catalogs have similar median masses and were expected to have the same correlation lengths when @xmath84 ; the correlation lengths are consistent with one another .",
    "these two models also have correlation lengths that are consistent with the observed lae correlation length of @xmath83 , making them good representations of laes at @xmath0 .",

    "fixing @xmath82 allows us to compare our results to previous works , but the best fit models are not consistent with this value .",
    "we find an average value of @xmath85 , which is consistent with the results from @xcite at @xmath86 using our fitting range .",
    "the similarities of the mass properties of the age - based catalogs ( see table [ model : mass ] ) imply that any difference in the clustering properties between age - based catalogs are due to the age definition and selection .",
    "the formation median and assembly median models have similar correlation lengths of @xmath87 and are consistent with the observed lae correlation length .",
    "the assembly young and formation young have higher correlation lengths of @xmath88 and are barely consistent at the 68% level with the @xmath28 lae correlation length .",
    "we can not rule out the young merger model at 95% confidence .",
    "the median merger model has a correlation length large enough to be ruled out at 93% confidence . this large correlation length and",
    "the high merger ages make the median merger model an unrealistic @xmath28 lae model .",
    "no other models are ruled out based on clustering . the observed trend for the formation and assembly ages that young aged models have a larger clustering length compared to the median aged models does not disagree with the findings of @xcite that the youngest @xmath89 of halos at @xmath4 cluster less strongly than the oldest @xmath89 .",
    "once we use a similar selection we also find that the oldest halos have higher clustering compared to the youngest .",
    "we used the ms - ii merger trees to find the @xmath86 ( snapnum 36 ) , @xmath90 ( snapnum 45 ) , and @xmath4 ( snapnum 67 ) descendants of the mock lae catalogs .",
    "we report the mass distributions of the descendants based on the mass of the host fof group , @xmath91 .",
