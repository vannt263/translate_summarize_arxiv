    "hamiltonian systems usually exhibit divided phase space , where regular and chaotic regions coexist .",
    "an important property of chaotic trajectories in divided phase spaces is the intermittent behavior with sporadically long periods of time spent near the border of regular regions @xcite . because of this stickiness and the ergodicity of the chaotic regions , even small islands can have a large effect on global properties of the system , such as transport @xcite and decay of correlations @xcite .",
    "the stickiness can be quantified in terms of the distribution @xmath1 of recurrence times @xmath2 of a typical trajectory to a pre - defined recurrence region , usually taken away from regular islands .",
    "for fully chaotic hyperbolic systems , the recurrence time distribution ( rtd ) decays exponentially @xcite , while for hamiltonian systems with divided phase space the rtd has been argued to decay approximately as a power law @xmath3 for large @xmath2 , where @xmath4 is a scaling exponent @xcite . for power - law decay ,",
    "the cumulative rtd is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "we say that a system has the property of stickiness if @xmath7 decays at least as slowly as @xmath8 for some @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of a finite mean recurrence time implies @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of stickiness has been observed , for example , in the transport of particles advected by fluid flows @xcite and in the fluctuations of conductance in chaotic cavities @xcite .    in hamiltonian systems",
    ", the border between a regular and chaotic region often presents a complex hierarchical structure of kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands and cantori .",
    "cantori are invariant cantor sets that work as partial barriers to the transport close to kam islands @xcite .",
    "although many properties of this structure are well understood , their consequences to the dynamics are still a matter of intense study @xcite . even in the simplest case of two - dimensional systems ,",
    "a number of non - equivalent models have been proposed to describe the stickiness of chaotic trajectories .",
    "meiss and ott introduced a markov - tree model that accounts for the hierarchical structure and predicts a scaling exponent @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "chirikov and shepelyansky used renormalization arguments at the breakdown of the golden mean torus to predict a universal exponent  @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "zaslavsky and co - workers applied different renormalization arguments to the case of self - similar island chains , obtaining simple relations between  @xmath13 and the scaling properties of these chains  @xcite .",
    "there is also strong evidence of other stickiness mechanisms in generic hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "the effects described in these previous works typically coexist and are responsible for finite - time numerical estimates of @xmath13 lying in the interval @xmath14",
    "however , because the convergence in hamiltonian systems can take an arbitrarily long time , in general it is not even clear whether the rtd approximates a power - law distribution in the asymptotic limit .",
    "this slow convergence has inspired motter and co - workers to introduce a new model that accounts for the effects of the cantori structure at finite times @xcite .",
    "while the general asymptotic behavior remains unresolved , the insight provided by the study of classes of comprehensible hamiltonian systems is of fundamental importance .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a mechanism for the stickiness of chaotic trajectories in hamiltonian systems with non - hierarchical borders between regular and chaotic regions when both regions can have positive measure .",
    "examples of systems with such a sharply divided phase space include piecewise - linear area - preserving maps @xcite and mushroom billiards @xcite . in hamiltonian systems",
    ", it is a common sense statement to relate the stickiness to the presence of hierarchical structures of kam islands and cantori . while this statement by itself is not wrong , here we show that regular islands with non - hierarchical borders also stick .",
    "our results are valid for both zero- and positive - measure regular islands , and include as particular cases previous findings for systems not exhibiting kam islands , such as the sinai and stadium billiards  @xcite .",
    "we find that the stickiness near non - hierarchical borders occurs due to the presence of one - parameter families of marginally unstable periodic orbits ( mupos ) .",
    "based on the analysis of mupos , we show that the recurrence time does follow a power - law distribution and that the scaling exponent is @xmath0 in two - dimensional sharply divided phase spaces , irrespective of other details of the system .",
    "we also study the properties of generic perturbations of these systems . based on numerical simulations of mushroom billiards perturbed by magnetic fields , we observe that the perturbations generate hierarchical structures of kam islands and cantori of the same nature of those observed in typical hamiltonian systems .",
    "the perturbation of hamiltonian systems with sharply divided phase space thus represents a new route to hamiltonian systems with hierarchical phase space .",
    "previously considered routes start either from fully integrable or fully chaotic configurations .",

    "the asymptotic distribution of escape times  @xmath1 as a function of the distribution of perturbations  @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 the distribution  @xmath76 depends on the choice of the initial conditions .    for instance",

    "this description is not valid when recurrences are calculated , because the initial conditions are chosen inside the recurrence region and thus _ away _ from the mupos . in this case , the convergence of  @xmath76 to the invariant measure is much slower ( algebraically for the stadium billiard  @xcite ) and for any finite time @xmath80 for  @xmath81 .",
    "however , we show in the appendix that the scaling exponent for this second case can be derived from the first : the power - law exponent increases by  @xmath82 when the initial conditions are taken away from the mupos , i.e. , @xmath83 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in systems with a one - parameter family of mupos , this leads to the asymptotic exponent  @xmath0 for the cumulative rtd , in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "since every family of mupos contributes with the same exponent  @xmath0 asymptotically , the exponent does not depend on the possible presence of other families of mupos in addition to the one at the border of the regular islands .",
    "indeed , a large number of other families is observed in mushroom billiards  @xcite , a small number in the continuous sawtooth map and none in the case of map  ( [ eq.map])-([eq.lee ] ) , and the scaling exponent is the same in each of these cases .",

    "for instance , the rtd of trajectories belonging to region ( 2 ) exhibits an approximate power - law decay that makes these recurrence events dominant not only for small times ( @xmath105 ) but also for very large times ( @xmath106 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the rtd of events associated to region ( 4 ) does not dominate the ( total ) rtd at any time .",
    "the slower decay of the rtd of region ( 2 ) is a consequence of the stickiness to the chain of secondary islands shown at the top of fig .",

    "we have studied the stickiness of chaotic trajectories in hamiltonian systems with sharply divided phase space , which are characterized by non - hierarchical borders between the regions of chaotic and regular motion .",
    "the stickiness occurs through the approach to one - parameter families of mupos in contact with the chaotic region .",
    "the main characteristics of this stickiness scenario are the exponent  @xmath0 for the power - law decay of the cumulative rtd and the long intervals of regular motion at a constant distance from families of mupos .",
    "dynamical systems described by this scenario include mushroom billiards and various piecewise - linear area - preserving maps .",
    "generic perturbations applied to systems with sharply divided phase space destroy the mupos and introduce hierarchies of regular islands and cantori .",
    "we believe that these perturbations can serve as a new paradigm to the study of stickiness in generic hamiltonian systems . using as an example mushroom billiards perturbed by a transverse magnetic field",
    ", we characterize two different scenarios of stickiness in the presence of perturbations . for small perturbations ,",
    "the stickiness is dominated by the primary chain of cantori , which work as partial barriers to the transport around the main regular island . in this case",
    ", the rtd is composed of a sum of exponential distributions associated to the probability of crossing each of these barriers . for increasing perturbations , the primary barriers weaken while the secondary islands and the corresponding sticking regions grow . for large perturbations ,",
    "the stickiness of the secondary structures becomes relevant and the exponential components of the rtd are converted themselves into power - law distributions .",
    "this provides direct evidence of the effects of cantori structures at finite times , in strong support of the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and its generalizations .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the rtd , which has been a matter of considerable recent debate  @xcite , can not be resolved alone by numerical experiments .",
    "our simulations suggest that the hierarchical structures enhance the stickiness of non - hierarchical borders , what would lead to an upper bound @xmath35 for the scaling exponent  @xmath13 .",
    "this upper bound is guaranteed when the phase space has one or more families of the mupos described in sec .",
    "[ sec.ii ] .",
    "however , in general , this numerical evidence of upper bound should be taken with caution because one can not neglect the possibility that the hierarchical structures will reduce the stickiness for asymptotically large times .",
    "for general hamiltonian systems , even the question of whether the oscillations in the rtd vanish asymptotically , giving rise to a well defined power - law exponent , is a problem yet to be settled .",
