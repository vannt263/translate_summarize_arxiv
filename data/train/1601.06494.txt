    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is one of the most popular computational approaches to material science and condensed - matter physics .",
    "however , the final accuracy of dft calculations depends on the approximation used for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional , which describes the quantum effects on the electron - electron interaction .",
    "thus , the development and testing of new xc functionals have been active research fields during the last decades @xcite .",
    "model systems are fundamental tools for the development of non - empirical dft functionals .",
    "one popular model is the electron gas with slowly - varying density . performing a second - order gradient expansion ( ge2 ) of the exchange energy density @xmath0",

    "another important model system is the semiclassical neutral atom ( sca ) , whose theory was established several years ago @xcite .",
    "this model has been recently used to derive a modified second - order gradient expansion ( mge2 ) for exchange @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this expansion has been shown to be relevant for the accurate dft description of atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "the two gradient expansions discussed above have been employed to develop gga functionals accurate either for solid - state ( e.g. the pbesol functional of ref . ) , or for chemistry ( e.g. the apbe of ref . ) .",
    "nevertheless , the exchange enhancement factor @xmath8 ( defined by @xmath9=\\int d{\\mathbf{r}}\\;\\epsilon_x^{lda}f_x(s)$ ] ) of both both pbesol and apbe behaves as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is fixed from the lieb - oxford bound @xcite , and @xmath12 is the pertinent second - order coefficient .",
    "the importance of the fourth - order term in this development has been already discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "it is important for intermediate values of the reduced gradient ( @xmath13 ) as those often encountered in bulk solids .",
    "indeed , functionals which recover ge2 , but with the @xmath14 term in the taylor expansion of exchange set to zero , e.g. the ones in refs , show a quite different behavior with respect to pbesol ( see also results in ref . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the relevance of higher - order terms in the modified gradient expansion has not yet been investigated .    in this work",
    "we consider this issue and we use the sca theory to introduce an extension of the modified gradient expansion to fourth - order ( mge4 ) .",
    "we show that this expansion is appropriate for both semiclassical atoms and solid - state problems .",
    "moreover , a simple gga , based on mge4 , is constructed .",
    "these achievements will emphasize the importance of the sca model for dft , not only when one is concerned with finite systems @xcite , but also in the popular field of solid - state physics .",
    "in ref . , the mge2 coefficient was derived by requiring that the expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ eee2 ] ) has to be large - z asymptotically exact to the 1st degree .",
    "thus , in practice , an energy constraint was applied and the mge2 was forced to recover the correct lowest coefficient of the semiclassical expansion of the exchange energy .    an alternative way to derive the mge2 , is to impose that , in the slowly - varying density region of non - relativistic large neutral atoms ( i.e. with @xmath15 ) , the modified gradient expansion recovers the exact exchange energy .",
    "thus , for @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 the integration is performed on the slowly - varying density region @xmath17 , defined by the condition @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "note that this region dominates for an atom with an infinite number of electrons and it is also the only one where a gradient expansion makes sense .",
    "the use of the reduced laplacian @xmath20 in the definition of @xmath17 is motivated by the fact that slowly - varying density regions of atoms can not be defined in terms of @xmath21 only , because the reduced gradient is small also near the nuclear cusp @xcite , where the density is rapidly varying .",
    "instead , they are well identified by considering the reduced laplacian @xmath20 and using the condition @xmath22 ( conversely @xmath23 near the nucleus and @xmath24 in the tail ) .",
    "the semiclassical theory of atoms is based on the thomas - fermi scaling @xcite , which implies the following scaling rules for the density and the reduced gradients : @xmath25 with @xmath26 , while the nuclear charge behaves as @xmath27 , in order to preserve the total charge neutrality . in eq .",
    "( [ e35 ] ) , @xmath28 is the wigner - seitz radius . using these scaling relations ,",

    "we obtain @xmath34 , that is practically the same result as in ref . .",
    "in principle , eq . ( [ eee1 ] ) could be also used to obtain higher - order results .",
    "nevertheless , such an approach is prone to large oscillations because the integral of @xmath35 is small by construction , as it is that of @xmath36 , for @xmath15 .",
    "thus , in order to extend the modified gradient expansion to fourth order , we need to impose an additional constraint beyond the energy one .",
    "we do this by requiring that the modified gradient expansion not only reproduces the sca asymptotic energy ( which yields mge2 ) , but also gives a realistic sca enhancement factor in the slowly - varying density limit . with this choice",
    "we also obtain to reduce the importance of high - density regions , which instead dominate the mge2 behavior , since they are the ones that mostly contribute to the energy density , thus , we can achieve a more balanced description of the whole slowly - varying regime ( including low - density regions , which are rather important in real bulk solids ) .",
    "we recall that the enhancement factor is not an observable and is defined only up to a gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the enhancement factor @xmath37 of the conventional exact exchange energy density is well defined and has a clear physical meaning ( i.e. it measures the interaction between an electron and the true exchange hole ) .",
    "note also that the non - uniqueness problem is reduced in the slowly - varying density limit , where the exact exchange hole has a semilocal expansion @xcite which becomes unique for the uniform electron gas .",

    "we observe that :    @xmath50 in the inner atomic core ( i.e. for @xmath51 ) , mge2 is very accurate and , because both @xmath21 and @xmath20 are relatively small , the forth - order terms in gradient expansions are not much significant .",
    "consequently , mge4 is as accurate as mge2 . on the other hand , the ge2 and ge4 exchange enhancement factors are smaller , on average , than the exact one and they do not describe with high accuracy this energetical region .",
    "in fact , despite both @xmath21 and @xmath20 are not large in this region , only @xmath20 is very close to zero , while @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath53 in the outer atomic core ( i.e. for @xmath54 ) , the reduced gradients @xmath21 and @xmath20 start to increase , but they are still smaller than 1 , thus the density is still slowly - varying .",
    "this atomic region is not very important for the total exchange energy of atoms , but it is a model for solid - state problems ( where the high - density limit is not common ) . while mge2 fails in this region , the mge4 and ge2 are very accurate .      the mge4 is accurate by construction for the slowly - varying density regime of large non - relativistic neutral atoms . to test it on a different model ,",

    "it involves the calculation of the lattice constant @xmath90 of ice ih and of the lattice constant @xmath91 of @xmath92-agi , which are used to define the lattice mismatch @xmath93 the lattice mismatch @xmath94 is an important quantity in many applications , since it determines the growth rate of ice on a @xmath92-agi surface ( for example , @xmath92-agi is used as seed crystal to produce artificial rainfall ) .",
    "however , the computational determination of the lattice mismatch is a quite hard task , since it involves the simultaneous calculation of the lattice constants of two materials with quite different electronic properties .",
    "for this reason its calculation is a challenge for semilocal density functionals @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tabice ] we report the computed lattice constants and the corresponding lattice mismatch , as obtained from several functionals . in this case",
    "we also report pbe results , since for this problem pbe is one of the best ggas , performing better than pbesol .",
    ".[tabice]calculated lattice constants",
    "(  ) for ice ih and @xmath92-agi as well as the corresponding lattice mismatch .",
    "experimental data are taken from ref . .",
    "the best result for each line is highlighted in bold .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     indeed , we see that pbe yields quite good results for the lattice constant of both materials , showing errors below 0.1  in both cases . however , because the errors for ice ih and @xmath92-agi lattice constants have opposite signs , the final lattice mismatch is computed rather inaccurately . on the other hand , pbesol performs well for @xmath92-agi , but yields a much larger error for ice ih .",
    "thus , the resulting lattice mismatch is definitely overestimated .",
    "a better balance in the performance is seen instead in the sg4 case .",
    "this functional is in fact the best for @xmath92-agi and between pbe and pbesol for ice ih .",
    "hence , it finally yields a lattice mismatch of 5.4% .",
    "this value is still too large with respect to the experimental one ( 2.2% ) , but improves with respect to the other ggas .",
    "in this paper we have used the sca theory to introduce a modified fourth - order gradient expansion ( mge4 ) , which is accurate for atoms and solid - state systems .",
    "the mge4 includes and extends the well - known mge2 .",
    "the extension over mge2 is obtained by using , in the gradient expansion construction , an additional constraint , beyond the energy one , which provides an improved description of slowly - varying regions of different materials . to implement the new constraint ,",
    "an integration over slowly - varying density regions was introduced in order to reduce computational noise and avoid the divergence of fourth order terms in rapidly - varying density regions .    to exploit the good features of mge4",
    "we have used it as a base to construct a simple gga functional , named sg4 .",
    "this functional is free of parameters fitted on real systems and satisfies several exact properties , including those relevant for the sca model , the lieb - oxford bound , the lda linear response behavior , and the rapidly - varying as well as the high - density limits of correlation .",
    "the sg4 functional performs well for a broad range of problems in solid - state physics , still preserving , thanks to the sca underlying theory , a reasonable performance also for molecular tests .",
    "due to this eclectic character , the sg4 functional is particularly promising for problems involving multiple electronic structure features , such as surface energies , vacancies , non - covalent interactions in bulk solids , and interfaces .    the results of the present work highlight , through the power of mge4 for different problems , the importance of the underlying sca model as a reference system in dft also for solid - state systems .",
    "this was the primary goal of the present work , since the relevance of the sca model system was often overlooked in the literature and the utility of this model has been often considered to be limited to the atomic and molecular framework .    to conclude we recall that gradient expansions are basic tools for the contruction of non - empirical dft functionals , even beyond the semilocal xc level @xcite .",
    "thus , in the future , further studies may focus on the use of mge4 to construct and optimize highly accurate functionals of different ranks , beyond the simple sg4 that we have presented here mainly to illustrate the practical utility of the sca theory .",
    "all atomic calculations used to derive the mge4 expansion have been performed using the engel code @xcite with the exact exchange functional .",
    "further tests of the mge4 on jellium clusters have been carried out employing accurate lda kohn - sham densities @xcite .",

    "we remark that the use of the same pseudopotential for all the functionals may lead to inaccuracies in the final results .",
    "nevertheless , the use of paw core potentials ensures good transferability for multiple functionals @xcite , since the core - valence interaction is recalculated for each functional .",
    "indeed , test calculations employing different variants of the paw potentials ( gga - paw ) have shown that the estimated convergence level of our calculations is about 1 m for lattice constants , 0.5 gpa for bulk moduli , and 0.01 ev for cohesive energies .",
    "all brillouin zone integrations were performed on @xmath95-centered symmetry - reduced monkhorst - pack @xmath96-point meshes , using the tetrahedron method with blchl corrections .",
    "for all the calculations a @xmath97 @xmath96-mesh grid was applied and the plane - wave cutoff was chosen to be 30% larger than maximum cutoff defined for the pseudopotential of each considered atom .",
    "the bulk modulus was obtained using the murnaghan equation of state .",
    "the cohesive energy , defined as the energy per atom needed to atomize the crystal , is calculated for each functional from the energies of the crystal at its equilibrium volume and the spin - polarized symmetry - broken solutions of the constituent atoms . to generate symmetry breaking solutions ,",
