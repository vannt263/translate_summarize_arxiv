    "plasmas formed in nanoscale matter by the interaction with intense light pulses ranging from near - infrared ( nir ) up to hard x - rays are a focus of current research .",
    "these studies are motivated by a large number of potential applications including the generation of energetic electrons and ions  @xcite as well as intense xuv and attosecond pulses  @xcite . besides , in single - shot x - ray imaging experiments of large molecules  @xcite and clusters  @xcite , the creation of an expanding nanoplasma generally causes severe limitations to the achievable resolution of the initial structure .",
    "controlling the nanoplasma dynamics for the purpose of exploiting its exceptional properties or for mitigating its detrimental effects requires in both cases a profound understanding of the dynamics of the ignition and the evolution of such nanoscale atomic and molecular systems in intense light fields . in the nir excitation regime ,",
    "the remarkable properties of nanoplasmas have been rationalized by a resonant interaction between the external light field and the dipolar oscillations in the collective electron motion driven by this field  @xcite .",
    "the resulting efficient light absorption induces avalanche - like charging and heating of the nanoplasma followed by hydrodynamic expansion and coulomb explosion .",
    "atomic - scale design of nanoscopic targets provides an attractive route to controlling the ionization processes herein .",
    "thus , even random placement of dopants into host clusters has resulted in significant enhancement of photon or electron emission  @xcite .",
    "much better defined two - component nanometer - sized systems are obtained by embedding atoms as dopants into superfluid helium ( he ) nanodroplets .",
    "novel resonant dynamics have been uncovered for these systems when driven by intense nir laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "these reports have triggered a search for the optimal conditions for doping in such clusters .",
    "he nanodroplets are ideal candidates for probing the effects of dopants properties on the ionization dynamics due to their extreme inertness with respect to chemical reactivity and to nir radiation , their homogeneous superfluid density distribution , and the simple electronic structure of constituent he atoms .",
    "furthermore , they offer the unique opportunity to vary the location of dopant atoms by appropriately choosing the atomic species  @xcite . while most dopants such as rare gases submerge into the droplet interior , alkali metal atoms and small clusters reside in dimple - like states at the droplet surface  @xcite .",
    "alkaline earth metals represent an intermediate case in that they generally localize within the surface layer  @xcite .",
    "a particularly curious dopant system is magnesium atoms which aggregate as a metastable foam - like structure in he droplets  @xcite . by simultaneously doping different species the location of the individual components",
    "can be varied due to the pulling of the submerged dopant to the surface  @xcite or vice versa  @xcite .",
    "for instance , by co - doping he droplets with calcium ( ca ) and xenon ( xe ) it was shown that ca atoms are attracted towards the xe cluster residing at the droplet center  @xcite . for the case of mixed doping with rubidium ( rb ) and xe atoms ,",
    "the dopants are expected to remain separated one from another due to the presence of a potential energy barrier  @xcite .",
    "our investigations exploit the singular feature of he nanodroplets to localize dopants in the interior or at the surface and we demonstrate that the dopants location plays a crucial role in the ionization by intense nir pulses .",
    "we show both in experiment and atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , that the capability of dopants to trigger avalanche - like ionization of the he host droplet leading to nanoplasma formation in a regime where the laser pulse does not directly ionize the host matrix  which we refer to as _ ignition _  conspicuously varies as function of the dopants physico - chemical properties .",
    "the efficiency of dopant - induced ignition is assessed by comparing various species ",
    "xe residing in the droplet interior , ca in the surface layer , and potassium ( k ) on the surface .",
    "a detailed analysis reveals the crucial properties of dopants which allows us to propose principles for optimally designing dopant clusters for nanoplasma studies .",
    "the experimental setup is composed of an amplified fs laser system for generating intense nir laser pulses and a molecular beam apparatus for generating doped he nanodroplets . the latter has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .    in short ,",
    "a beam of he nanodroplets is generated by continuously expanding pressurized he ( @xmath0 bar ) of high purity ( he 6.0 ) out of a cold nozzle ( @xmath1 k ) with a diameter of @xmath2 @xmath3 m into vacuum . at these expansion conditions",

    "the he droplets are doped with rare gas and metal atoms by passing through a scattering cell which contains atomic vapor with adjustable pressure .",
    "when increasing the doping pressure of either rare gas or metal vapor the he droplets pick up few atoms which aggregate to form clusters inside ( rare gases ) or at the droplet surface ( alkali , alkaline earth metals )  @xcite . at higher vapor pressures ,",
    "the he droplets undergo massive scattering and shrinkage due to evaporation induced by the transfer of transverse momentum and the deposition of kinetic and binding energy ( dopant - dopant and dopant - he ) .",
    "this leads to a general decrease in all droplet - correlated signals .",
    "the average number of dopants attached to the he droplets is inferred from the measured dopant partial pressure using detailed simulations of the pick - up process  @xcite . in the detector chamber , the doped he droplet beam crosses the focused laser beam at right angles in the center of a standard time - of - flight ( tof ) ion mass spectrometer .",
    "the laser pulses ( center wave length @xmath5 nm , pulse length @xmath6 fs ) are generated by chirped pulse amplification ( coherent legend ) at a repetition rate of 5 khz .",
    "the pulses are focused by a lens ( focal length @xmath7 mm ) placed inside the detector chamber to reach a maximum peak intensity @xmath8 in the focal volume .",

    "the binding potentials of he@xmath9 and of other he@xmath10 complexes are not implemented , so that the simulations can not account for the he@xmath9 formation explicitly ; we can only estimate an upper bound of the he@xmath9 abundance from the remaining groundstate neutral he atoms and he@xmath11 ions at the end of each trajectory .",
    "neutral he atoms and he@xmath11 ions which are formed by three - body electron - ion recombination are rydberg state atoms and are therefore excluded from the estimate of the he@xmath9 production .",

    "the surprising result at first sight is that both the dopants and the he host atoms charge up to the by far highest charge states for the xe@xmath20 case as compared to k doping ( 9.7 and 2 , respectively , in units of the elementary charge @xmath24 ) , in spite of the much higher first ionization energy of xe ( 12.1 ev ) than for k ( 4.3 ev ) .    for k dopants ,",

    "this competition is not always in favor of eii .",
    "it turns out that , depending on slight variations of the trajectories initial conditions but for the same pulse parameters , either he ionization does not take place at all , ceases after a few he atoms , or ignition occurs , that is , ionization propagates avalanche - like through a large part or the entire he droplet . which factors contribute to ignition and determine the incubation time , is subject of a detailed mechanistic study and",
    "will be published in a subsequent paper .",
    "we define an average he charge of 0.1 as an empirical criterion for the detection of the onset of ignition .",
    "the exact choice of the threshold value is uncritical in view of the rapid charging process in the he droplet .",
    "the sensitivity to the initial conditions is high for those dopant sizes and pulse parameters for which the occurrence of ignition is on the knife s edge . in those trajectories with ignition , the average charge per he atom jumps to almost 2 within @xmath28-@xmath29 fs , and the trajectory set - averaged he charge jumps to 1.0 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : charging ] c ) ] with an ignition probability of 0.52 . for these pulse parameters ion - electron recombination and he@xmath9 formation do not occur ;",
    "recombination becomes important for @xmath30 w@xmath14 .",

    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : charging ] d ) . the long - time ignition probabilities for k@xmath31 , ca@xmath20 and xe@xmath20 dopants are 0.01 , 0.30 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the k@xmath31 and k@xmath21 examples reveal a dopant cluster size effect : the ignition probability increases with the number of dopant atoms as a larger dopant cluster provides more seed electrons and a stronger electric field created by the sum of dopant ion charges , thereby assisting eii by reducing the coulomb barrier at the adjacent he atoms .",
    "moreover , the dopant cluster size effect is nonlinear : while for k@xmath31 the average charge per k atom remains 1 during the incubation time [ fig .",
    "[ fig : charging ] b ) ] , for k@xmath21 it rises gradually , making via eii also up to two inner shell electrons available for seed ionizations .",
    "ca@xmath31 contributes by its two valence electrons per atom .    with an ignition probability of 1",
    ", the xe@xmath31 cluster has the highest ignition efficiency as compared to the k and ca dopants of the same size .",
    "for xe@xmath31 , the initial seed ionization begins much closer to the center of the laser pulse ( @xmath32 fs ) than for k and ca dopants . within an incubation time of only a few fs , up to three seed electrons per atom",
    "are set free by ti , bsi and eii , in contrast to only one seed electron per atom in the k@xmath31 case .",
    "this can be rationalized by the relatively low second and third ionization energies of xe of 21.0 and 32.1 ev , compared to 31.6 and 45.7 ev for k. further reasons for the low ignition capability of k@xmath31 are its long incubation time and its surface location . delaying the initial ionization of k artificially until @xmath33 fs ( the instant when ti sets in for xe )",
    ", the detrimental effect of outer ionization of the seed electrons is reduced and the ignition probability increases to 0.6 .",
    "furthermore , the interior doping site of xe brings the laser - driven cloud of quivering seed electrons in closer contact with the host cluster .",
    "the aspect of dopant location and dopant - he interatomic distance will be addressed later .",
    "the average dopant charge state is considerably enhanced in case of ignition  @xcite , since eii as the almost exclusive ionization channel critically depends on the laser - driven nanoplasma electron cloud .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : charging ] b ) for k@xmath21 and ca@xmath31 . in these examples",

    "[ fig : charging ] e ) exhibits the time - dependent average electron kinetic energies .",
    "their time - dependent shape is determined by the instants of ignition .",
    "trajectories without ignition almost do not contribute because of their small number of electrons .",
    "the average electron kinetic energies obtained along single trajectories are in the range of @xmath34-@xmath27 , @xmath35-@xmath27 and @xmath36-@xmath27 ev for k@xmath21 , ca@xmath20 and xe@xmath20 doped he@xmath19 droplets , respectively .",
    "the smaller trajectory set - averaged values for k@xmath21 and ca@xmath20 as compared to xe@xmath20 doping are also due to the larger spread of ignition times . however , the reason for the higher average xe charge [ fig .",
    "[ fig : charging ] b ) ] is not the somewhat higher electron kinetic energies but the larger eii cross sections of xe .",
    "the outer ionization level in case of ignition can be derived from fig .",
    "[ fig : charging ] c ) as the difference of the average he charge @xmath37 ( solid line for xe@xmath20 and dashed lines for the k@xmath21 and ca@xmath20 doped droplets ) and the nanoplasma electron population @xmath38 per atom ( dotted lines , obtained from the number of nanoplasma electrons within six droplet radii from the droplet center of mass ) .",
    "in all the three cases , the outer ionization amounts to about 0.5 elementary charges per atom .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows that the main energy absorption takes place by the nanoplasma electrons during the avalanche eii .",
    "however , damping of the laser - driven nanoplasma electron oscillation is very strong as a large part of the absorbed energy is consumed by eii , such that a nanoplasma resonance is unlikely to be present during this phase .",
    "this changes only near the termination of avalanche ionization when damping becomes small and energy absorption is still considerable , apparently driving outer ionization during this time period .",
    "a resonance also seems to be present during the incubation time , involving the seed electrons and a limited number of electrons set free from he ionization , when energy absorption is positive and damping is small .",
    "although this small nanoplasma resonance does not carry weight in the total energy balance of the droplet , it might be important for the ignition process .",
    "pristine he droplets for @xmath39 w@xmath14 ( i.e. , for intensities when ti rates at he become notable ) show the same behavior : ( i ) resonance as long as only a limited number of he atoms is ionized , ( ii ) strong damping during avalanche eii and ( iii ) a second resonance with strong energy absorption towards the completion of the nanoplasma formation .",
    "thus , the initial phase before the onset of avalanche eii resembles the experiment of schtte et al .",
    "@xcite where the seed electrons are generated by an xuv laser pulse . at lower pulse peak intensities ( e.g. , @xmath40 w@xmath14 ) , avalanche ionization is not complete during the laser pulse , so that the only nanoplasma resonance occurs during the incubation time .",
    "these energy absorption and nanoplasma resonance phenomena as well as their implications for the ignition mechanism require further investigations . in this context",
    "it will also be of interest to characterize the damping of the nanoplasma in terms of the quality factor of damped oscillators .",
    "the efficiency of igniting a he nanoplasma is manifested by the appearance of he ion signals .",
    "[ fig : dopingcurve ] shows the experimental yield of he@xmath11 , he@xmath41 , and he@xmath42 ions recorded as a function of the vapor pressure of dopants .",
    "the latter is adjusted by controlling the temperature of the heated crucible in the case of k and ca and by leaking xe into the doping chamber using a dosing valve .",
    "the conspicuous result is that by far the highest he ion yields are obtained when doping with xe , whereas doping with ca and k provides lower he ion yields by about one and two orders of magnitude , respectively . when increasing the doping pressure starting from zero , the he ion yields first rise due to enhanced efficiency of the dopant - induced ignition process .",
    "the diminishing of ion yields for high doping pressures is a consequence of massive droplet beam depletion due to the release of binding energy when dopant atoms aggregate into clusters inside the droplets as well as scattering of the droplets away from the beam axis , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] . effectively both density and size of",
    "the he droplets in the laser interaction region are thus reduced .",

    "[ fig : expsim ] a)-c ) .",
    "the rescaling of dopant pressure to the number of dopant atoms relies on the detailed simulation of the doping process  @xcite .",
    "the measured yields of he@xmath45 and he@xmath41 ions as a function of the number of dopant atoms picked up on average by one droplet attains the highest values for xe at about 13 dopant atoms .",
    "in contrast , the highest he@xmath45 signal observed for k - doping stays below that for xe - doping by factor @xmath46 .",
    "when doping with ca atoms , the he@xmath45 ion yield comes close to the one obtained for xe - doping at low doping numbers ( @xmath476 ) , but continuously falls off as the doping level is increased .",
    "this diminishing of ion yields is primarily a consequence of massive droplet beam depletion by the large binding energy released when ca clusters aggregate inside the droplets .",

    "far the largest he ion yields are obtained for xe doping . for ca and k doping , the small signal intensities stem from intensities @xmath54 w@xmath14 for which the droplet ignites by itself because of ti of he . only for @xmath55 for ca and @xmath56 for k ,",
    "a slight signal increase occurs , when the dopants are able to induce ignition at the next lower intensity , @xmath57 w@xmath14 , at which the focal volume is sampled .",
    "the experimental signal increase already for a small number of dopant atoms is caused by the admixture of signal intensities from larger dopants in the dopant size distribution and therefore can not be reproduced by the simulations .",
    "likewise , the decrease of the experimental signal for larger dopants because of droplet evaporation can not be accounted for .",
    "the order of the he@xmath11 and he@xmath41 signal intensities compared to the experimental signal is reversed which we partly attribute to the averaging over the broad he droplet size distribution .",

    "for these larger dopant clusters we find strongly enhanced he ion yields even for doping with ca and k , see fig .",
    "[ fig : theosignalssizes ] .",
    "the larger number of dopant atoms supply enough seed ionizations for he ignition at low laser intensities which make up the largest part of the laser focus volume .",
    "note that , as a consequence of focal averaging , for doping with @xmath60 ca or @xmath61 k atoms which make the low intensities in the periphery of the focus volume available for ignition , the yield of the he ions even exceeds the maximum yield reached for xe doping .",

    "the contribution of these very low intensities is on the order of 10% and is neglected here .",

    "the latter ones are distinguished by parallel and perpendicular orientation of the dopant - droplet complex with respect to the linear laser polarization .",
    "the data clearly show three main trends in dopant - induced ignition :    \\(i ) a lower intensity can be compensated to a large extent by larger dopant clusters .",
    "this is due to the larger number of seed electrons available for eii and by the higher sum of ion charges which assist eii by reducing the coulomb barrier at he .",
    "in addition , for a given species the number of seed ionizations per dopant atom increases with the number of dopant atoms , as shown for the k@xmath31 and k@xmath21 dopants ( cf .",
    "[ fig : charging ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) dopants which are easily multiply ionized ( xe , ca ) are considerably favored , for the same reasons as in ( i ) .",
    "\\(iii ) dopants residing in the droplet interior ignite the neighboring he atoms more efficiently , as the cloud of seed electrons quivering in the driving laser field has better contact with the he host droplet .",
    "for all three dopants , a significantly larger number of dopants is needed for ignition of surface - bound dopant clusters at any laser intensity , where the parallel orientation is more favorable than the perpendicular one .",
    "surface doping in parallel orientation typically requires 1 - 3 dopant atoms more to reach the same ignition efficiency as interior doping ; the same gradation is found for surface doping between parallel and perpendicular orientation .",
    "another parameter which may severely impact the ignition efficiency of dopants attached to he droplets is the dopant - he interatomic distance as it affects the dopant - droplet contact strength as well .",
    "it is quite distinct for the three species under study and carries some uncertainty mainly due to unknown cluster size effects .",

    "while the general trend is , as expected , the decrease of the ignition probability with increasing he - dopant separation , xe@xmath20 in its interior doping state is so efficient that its ignition probability remains 1 in the entire considered distance range .",
    "in contrast , k@xmath20 does not reach the ignition probability of xe@xmath20 , even when it is brought to the droplet interior at the shorter he - xe distance , confirming that geometrical effects alone can not account for the larger ignition capability of xe .",

    "in conclusion , our investigations , theoretical and experimental , benchmark generic principles for the design of dopant clusters for efficient nanoplasma generation by examining the ability of k , ca , and xe dopants to ignite he droplets . the dopants ability to trigger ignition of he droplets induced by eii at moderate laser intensities is determined ( i ) by the ability to provide initial seed electrons to drive electron - impact ionization of the he droplet , ( ii ) by the doping site  interior or surface state  and he - dopant distance which both determine the contact strength of the laser - driven quivering electron cloud with the he droplet , and ( iii ) , as an experimental constraint , by the dopant s heat of cluster formation which induces partial droplet evaporation . while providing seed electrons",
    "remains a necessary condition for efficient dopant induced ignition , the ease of multiple , not just single , ionization of dopant atoms provides the key to droplet ignition .",
    "surprisingly , low - lying first ionization energies of dopants which maximize the useful focal volume in an experiment are also detrimental to ignition since long incubation times favor outer ionization of seed electrons , as revealed in the case of k doping .    among the considered mono - elemental dopant clusters",
    ", xe has the highest ignition efficiency , unifying the advantage of up to three seed ionizations per atom , occupying interior doping sites in the he droplet , and the lowest heat of dopant cluster formation .",
    "however , the first ionization energy imposes the limitation that seed ionization sets in only at @xmath64 w@xmath14 .",
    "the possibility of optimizing the physico - chemical properties of the dopant clusters by mixing various species inside the same he droplet will be studied in a forthcoming work .      stimulating discussions with th .",
