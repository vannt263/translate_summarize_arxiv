    "the entangled networks of microtubules and actin filaments form the cytoskeleton of most eukaryotic cells , stabilize their morphology and determine the rheological properties of the cytosol .",
    "these intricate networks are created and maintained by an efficient mechanism which involves various types of motor proteins as well as passive crosslinking proteins .",
    "motors are specialized protein molecules that move along the cytoskeletal polymer scaffold and perform directed intracellular transport @xcite . additionally ,",
    "if motors bind to more than one filament , they are able to move the filaments and reorganize the cytoskeleton itself . the crosslinks connect different filaments but do not move along them .",
    "their main function is thus believed to provide rigidity and elasticity to the cytoskeleton .",
    "various experiments have been performed in recent years that shed light on the viscoelastic behavior of entangled cytoskeletal filament solutions , ranging from filament - motor mixtures @xcite , crosslinked filaments @xcite , and systems of filaments , motors and crosslinks @xcite .",
    "surprising new effects have been found such as active fluidization of actin gels by myosin motors @xcite .    maintained in a state far from equilibrium , the active filaments exhibit a strong tendency towards self - organization .",
    "bundles and contracting states have been found _ in vitro _ in actomyosin extracted from muscle cells @xcite , and various patterns like ray - like asters , spindle - like structures and rotating vortices have been reported in quasi two - dimensional mixtures of microtubules and motors @xcite .",
    "these dissipative structures have inspired many theoretical efforts @xcite directed towards modeling active filament solutions .    while crosslinks",
    "so far have been mainly investigated only in the context of rheology , recently their influence on the dynamics and self - organization also attracted attention @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that crosslinks facilitate the formation of bundles in the actin - myosin system : at high concentration of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , actin - myosin systems display an isotropic phase ; in the course of depletion of atp however , myosin motors become static crosslinks and initiate the formation of oriented bundles and cluster - like patterns .",
    "reintroduction of atp in the bundled state resulted in consequent dissolution of the structures and reestablishment of the isotropic state .",
    "motivated by these experimental results , we focus here on the effects of static crosslinks on the self - organization of polar filaments and generalize the model for microtubule - motor interaction introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite . in that model ,",
    "the complicated process of filament interaction via multi - headed molecular motors was approximated by instant binary `` inelastic collisions '' , leading to alignment of the filament orientation vectors and attraction between their centers of mass .",
    "crosslinks alter these interaction rules . in particular , if two parallel filaments are cross - linked , they are not able to slide past each other and become collocated .",
    "we model this effect here by suppressing relative sliding of the filaments in the course of alignment .",
    "our analysis shows that this relatively minor modification produces a nontrivial macroscopic effect , namely the isotropic density instability of the polar oriented state of the filaments becomes transverse . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", this new kind of instability leads to the formation of dense oriented bundles , similar to those seen in experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the model without crosslinks demonstrates an isotropic instability in which density and orientation of the filaments are uncorrelated , and no bundling occurs .",
    "here we outline the model of self - organization of microtubule - motor mixtures developed in our earlier works , refs .",
    "the microtubules are modeled as identical rigid polar rods of length @xmath0 , and the molecular motors are introduced implicitly through corresponding interaction probabilities .",
    "binary interactions of microtubules via multi - headed molecular motors are approximated by instant inelastic collisions leading to alignment of the microtubule orientation angles @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , the unit vectors @xmath2 ) according to the following rules : @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the orientations of the two rods after the collision , and the constant `` restitution '' parameter @xmath5 characterizes the inelasticity of the collision ( in analogy to the restitution coefficient in granular media ) .",
    "the angle between the two rods is reduced after the collision by the `` inelasticity '' factor @xmath6 .",
    "of special interest is the totally inelastic collision corresponding to @xmath7 or @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the rods acquire the same orientation along the bisector @xmath9 , and their center of mass positions , @xmath10 , also align : @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the orientation angles and the center of mass positions after the collision .",

    ", but the midpoint positions do not coincide due to the crosslink ( blue sphere ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    the effect of crosslinks on the motor - induced interaction of filaments is twofold .",
    "first , the simultaneous action of a static crosslink , serving as a hinge , and a motor moving along both filaments results in a fast and complete alignment of the filaments , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this justifies the assumption of fully inelastic collisions for the rods interaction .",
    "note that without crosslinks the overall change in the relative orientation of the filaments is much smaller : the angle between filaments decreases only by 25 - 30 % in average , see the discussion in ref .",
    "complete alignment also can occur for the case of simultaneous action of two motors moving in opposite direction , as in experiments on kinesin - ncd mixtures reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and even for two motors of the same type moving in the same direction but with a different speed due to variability of the properties and the stochastic character of the motion .",
    "second , the crosslinks inhibit relative sliding of rods in the course of alignment , restricting the motion to rotation only . thus , in contrast to the situation considered in refs",
    ".  @xcite and described by eq .",
    "( [ wo_crossl ] ) , in the presence of a crosslink the midpoints of the rods _ will not coincide _ after the interaction .",
    "in fact , the distances @xmath59 from the midpoints to the crosslink point do not change , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "to describe the interaction rules in the presence of a crosslink , we express the radius - vector of an arbitrary point on a filament @xmath60 via the position of its midpoint @xmath61 , the filament orientation @xmath62 , and the distance from the center of mass @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the intersection point of two rods is given by the condition @xmath65 , which fixes the values of @xmath59 to @xmath66 due to the crosslink , the values of @xmath59 do not change during the interaction . since the filaments become oriented along the bisector direction @xmath47 , the distance of the two filament midpoints from the total center of mass will be @xmath67 .",
