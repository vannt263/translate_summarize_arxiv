    "work on population ecology carried out in the 1970 s certainly helped chaos to move center stage as a new interdisciplinary subject @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional discrete - time models are technically among the simplest ones to consider and interpret .",
    "they provide an appropriate description of species with non - overlapping generations .",
    "the basic example for the evolution of a population density @xmath0 at generation @xmath1 is the linear law @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 represents the growth rate or fecundity , assumed constant .",
    "it is , however , too schematic allowing only extinction ( @xmath4 ) , equilibrium ( @xmath5 ) or infinite growth ( @xmath6 ) . it was soon recognized that more realistic models should be nonlinear : @xmath7 written in this form , @xmath8 is the dimensionless non - constant fitness function of the population or per - capita growth rate . a sage choice for it should capture the essential features of the system .",
    "the crucial point is that once nonlinearity is let in , a huge variety of new phenomena may appear as is now universally recognized .",
    "thus , discrete time population ecology is in close contact with discrete dynamical system theory .",
    "for instance , the choice @xcite @xmath9 renders easy the numerical determination of the parameter values from experimental population data by a linear fit to @xmath10 versus @xmath11 , which constitutes certainly a salient advantage . in ( [ eq : gradwell ] ) the presence of parameter @xmath12 , the conventional carrying capacity , ensures the dimensionless character of @xmath8 .",
    "a slight variant of it reads @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a threshold population density and the fitness parameter @xmath15 is dimensionless .    for the purposes of the present paper",
    "we emphasize that these and similar models can also be used as mathematical instances of dynamical systems to illustrate different features when the ranges of parameters and time variable are enlarged beyond those realistic in population dynamics . in this spirit , we analyze here the one - dimensional discrete model associated with equation ( [ eq : hassell ] ) which will be referred to as vgh ( varley - gradwell - hassell ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is briefly explained that the system is chaotic for @xmath16 and regular for @xmath17 , pointing out that in the order - to - chaos transition no cascade of period doubling emerges . in the present paper",
    "we analyze numerically and analytically how such a transition takes place which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been studied in detail in the mathematics or ecology literature .    the system function is continuous for @xmath18 and discontinuous otherwise .",
    "piecewise continuous maps are , by far , less analyzed than continuous ones in the literature .",
    "also , we address our attention to the role of the threshold parameter @xmath14 , to which no much attention seems to have been given .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : descript ] we describe the features of the vgh map , present some traits of the associated dynamical system , and briefly introduce the pertinent equations to compute the lyapunov exponent . in section [ sec : b ] the transition order - to - chaos is studied in detail .",
    "some exact results are presented for @xmath19 and an explanation for the observed bifurcation is propounded . in section",
    "[ sec : xi ] the effect of varying @xmath14 and @xmath3 is analyzed .",
    "finally , section [ sec : fin ] contains our conclusions . for the sake of completeness , two technical appendices are included .",
    "in particular , [ app : bookkeeping ] contains a thorough analytical study of the vgh map in the critical case @xmath19 .",
    "we write the vgh map , equation ( [ eq : hassell ] ) , in the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 in going from ( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) and ( [ eq : hassell ] ) to ( [ eq : iterate ] ) and ( [ eq : varley1 ] ) we have used the carrying capacity @xmath12 as our natural unit to measure population densities and correspondingly introduced the dimensionless variable @xmath22 , and parameter @xmath23 .    the function @xmath24 in ( [ eq : varley1 ] )",
    "is defined in @xmath25 although , being a population variable , we take @xmath26 . in the three dimensional parameter space @xmath27",
    "we consider only the region @xmath28 to ensure decrease of @xmath24 with increasing @xmath29 ; @xmath30 for compatibility with the range for @xmath29 .",
    "according to this map the population density in a given generation is a linear function of that in the previous one as far as it does not exceed a critical value @xmath31 . for greater values",
    "the population follows a nonlinear power - law .",
    "figure [ fig : v_plot ] illustrates the different possibilities and we expect , therefore , differences in the response of the system according to whether the value of @xmath31 is below or above unity .    for some purposes ,",
    "we have found it useful to express the vgh map in terms of the new variable @xmath32 and the new parameter @xmath33 @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath6 .",
    "the numeric factor two in ( [ eq : xi ] ) has been introduced for convenience .",
    "the inverse transformation reads @xmath36 this leads from ( [ eq : varley1 ] ) to @xmath37 now with phase space @xmath38 .",
    "this representation of the map has just two effective parameters . from a mathematical point of view",
    "this transformed version is piecewise linear , whereas ( [ eq : varley1 ] ) defines a piecewise continuous nonlinear system .",
    "linearization is a standard procedure in the study of dynamical systems .",
    "it usually follows from first order approximations . here",
    ", however , the linearization is exact . in [ app",
    ": lin ] we collect some results obtained from this version of the dynamical system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that dynamical systems of the same type can be found in applications in electronics , robotics and mechanical systems with impacts @xcite .",
    "we present here some of the most apparent features of the dynamical system originated by the iteration of the vgh map .    first we can dispose of the case @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath39 is then always an stable fixed point . when @xmath40 there is a second fixed point at @xmath41 which is stable if @xmath42 and which attracts any initial condition in the interval @xmath43 with @xmath44 . for @xmath19 , that interval",
    "consists of period-2 points , with the exception of the fixed point @xmath45 .",
    "values @xmath46 and @xmath47 go to @xmath39 .",
    "observe that here @xmath4 does not necessarily imply extinction.this is due to the interplay between the different parameters .    for @xmath5",
    "any initial condition in @xmath48 $ ] remains fixed . if @xmath49 then @xmath50 is also fixed .",
    "it is stable for @xmath42 attracting any initial condition in the interval @xmath43 with @xmath51 . if @xmath19 , the interior points of that interval , except @xmath50 , are paired in 2-cycles .",
    "points to the right of @xmath52 are eventually fixed , reaching its limiting fixed value in two steps .    for @xmath6",
    ", @xmath39 is an unstable fixed point , independently of @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath40 , also @xmath41 is fixed , although it is stable only for @xmath42 .    in the rest of the paper we consider only @xmath6 which , as we shall see , generates a much richer behavior .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is a measure of the rate at which two initially close trajectories move away . for the one - dimensional discrete map @xmath53 the computation of the lyapunov exponent @xmath54 admits an analytical formula",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath55\\theta(x_k - c)\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] whereas ( [ eq : zlog ] ) yields @xmath56 both formulas are given in terms of heaviside @xmath57 function which selects the iterations that visit @xmath58 or @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the mathematical equivalence of the two expressions for @xmath54 in ( [ eq : l2 ] ) and ( [ eq : l2z ] ) yields the following result for the statistics of points @xmath60 in the attractor @xmath61 = \\frac{\\ln r}{b}\\ ] ] which tells that the geometric mean of all the points @xmath60 in the trajectory equals the value @xmath62 . a simpler version of ( [ eq : l2 ] ) reads now @xmath63    equation ( [ eq : l1 ] ) makes use of the derivative @xmath64 which in the present case is not defined at @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "as it is an isolated point , it does not amount any numerical difficulty .    in practice",
    ", one has to take care of discarding transients in order to allow the orbit to enter the attractor .",
    "in particular , transients are very long for chaotic trajectories when @xmath67 . besides , it is convenient to average @xmath54 over a number of initial seeds .",
    "the interpretation of the lyapunov exponent in this system is particularly straightforward : @xmath54 is ruled by the proportion of exterior points in the trajectories , namely those with @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "since the summation in ( [ eq : l2 ] ) and ( [ eq : l2z ] ) is over a large enough number of points on the trajectory , numerical accuracy is a relevant issue . to this end , and following the analysis in @xcite , we have used the multi - precision fortran package mpfun @xcite which allows one to efficiently compute with very high number of digits .",
    "we concluded that double precision gives here enough computational guaranties as regards ( [ eq : l2 ] ) and ( [ eq : l2z ] ) .",
    "by contrast , it is not the case for the computation of trajectories of ( [ eq : zlog ] ) with some integer values @xmath16 , an issue that we deal with in section [ sec : b - integer ] .",
    "as already stated in @xcite , the chaotic regime corresponds to @xmath16 , independently of the values of @xmath31 and @xmath3 , without stable regularity windows embedded .",
    "this is clear from the positive character of @xmath54 in ( [ eq : l2simple ] ) when @xmath16 .    in the limit @xmath69",
    "the lyapunov exponent becomes very small due to the term @xmath70 , since the proportion of exterior points is finite .",
    "following results on nonextensive thermodynamics it may be pertinent to wonder whether a power law @xmath71 is a more appropriate ansatz than the exponential @xmath72 to measure the divergence of initially close trajectories @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a statistics of the largest separations , in this limit , as a function of @xmath1 and the results point out towards a clear exponential divergence .",
    "the behaviour of the system with respect to @xmath68 is illustrated by the bifurcation diagrams in figure [ fig : v_r2_bif - b ] .",
    "the three panels correspond to @xmath73 , from top to bottom , respectively , with the fixed value @xmath74 . in figure",
    "[ fig : v_c25_r2_xly ] we plot the bifurcation diagram for @xmath75 and @xmath74 , as well as the lyapunov exponent @xmath54 ( upper panel ) .",
    "notice the irregularities in the curve around the value @xmath76 where the bifurcation diagram exhibits a number of band merging crises @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned sudden transition from a regular to a chaotic system , with no period doubling , is apparent . as the negative sign of the computed lyapunov exponent witnesses , @xmath17 means regular behavior : every initial seed ends up in a periodic orbit .    for fixed @xmath17 ,",
    "the attractor consists of coexisting limit cycles .",
    "its cardinal is a piecewise constant function of @xmath31 .",
    "so , there exist some values @xmath77 ( @xmath78 integer )",
    "that punctuate the sequence of the number of points that make up the attractor .",
    "the cardinal is given by the heuristic formula @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 , whose first few terms read @xmath81 they can be interpreted as forming two intermingled sequences whose terms increase by one and two units respectively .    the diagram in figure [ fig : seq ]",
    "gives a perspective of this situation for @xmath82 and @xmath74 , as a function of @xmath31 .    in the rest of this section",
    "we focus our attention on the case @xmath19 which separates the regular and chaotic regimes .",
    "we present both numerical and analytical results .",
    "the reader is referred to [ app : bookkeeping ] for details .      for @xmath19 and fixed @xmath6",
    "the orbit of an arbitrary initial condition @xmath83 , is simple enough to be rigorously described .",
    "the behavior is varied and shows an interesting dependence on the parameter @xmath31 . in particular",
    "this permits to appraise the effect of the discontinuity . as detailed below , the general characteristic in this case",
    "is that all the initial conditions are fixed , periodic or eventually periodic .",
    "there exist an infinity of coexisting limit cycles .",
    "their periods are allowed to take only a restricted set of values , which depend on the initial condition and parameters value through very strict laws .",
    "we defer their detailed description to [ app : bookkeeping ] .",
    "the reader can find there precise information about the transients length and exact account of the cycles .",
    "here we report only the most salient features in terms of the variable @xmath29 and threshold parameter @xmath31 .    if @xmath84 , then the closed interval @xmath85 $ ] is invariant under the action of the map .",
    "any interior point @xmath86 belongs to the @xmath87cycle @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is a fixed point .",
    "the extremes @xmath90 and @xmath91 as well as all the exterior points are eventually periodic , entering the invariant interval after a transient .    if @xmath92 , then the closed interval @xmath93 $ ] is invariant under the action of the map .",
    "every exterior point is eventually periodic .",
    "interior points are periodic . for fixed @xmath31 , the period of the cycles",
    "depends on @xmath94 but can take on only a restricted set of values .",
    "for instance , with @xmath95 one finds a @xmath96cycle : @xmath97 ; a @xmath98cycle : @xmath99 ; and the rest of the points in the interval accommodates in an infinity of @xmath100cycles .",
    "all these cycles are the limit cycles for the eventually periodic points .",
    "notice that in this system the existence of period three does not imply chaos .",
    "this is not in conflict with the celebrated li and yorke theorem because the vgh map is defined by a discontinuous function .    the basins of attraction of such limit cycles are infinite intermingled sets of zero measure made of equidistant points in the @xmath32 variable .",
    "the vertical segments located at @xmath19 in figures [ fig : v_r2_bif - b ] and [ fig : v_c25_r2_xly ] comprise all the coexisting limit cycles . in numerical simulations",
    "such a vertical segment gets filled only if enough initial conditions are used in the construction of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "next we develop an heuristic explanation for the origin of the order - to - chaos bifurcation observed at @xmath19 . as is well known , period-2 points are fixed points of the second iterate @xmath101}$ ] of the map . in the cobweb plot of @xmath101}$ ] shown in figure",
    "[ fig : cobweb2 ] the relevant element is the piece of @xmath101}$ ] which is co - linear with the bisectrix , because it conveys the existence of a continuous interval of fixed points . leaving apart the fixed point of @xmath24 , these points pair themselves to form the alluded period-2 orbits . by the cobweb construction the rest of the points eventually land in the piece on the bisectrix .",
    "whenever an infinite set of trajectories of period @xmath102 is observed , with @xmath19 , it is because this value of the parameter forces @xmath103}$ ] to have one or more segments co - linear with the bisectrix too .",
    "the question is then : which are the conditions for the map @xmath24 to allow iterates @xmath103}$ ] to have pieces co - linear with the bisectrix ?",
    "our answer is that the phenomenon may take place whenever the piecewise continuous map @xmath24 has a piece defined by a power - law function . to buttress this answer",
    "let us write the general expression of a term of @xmath103}$ ] as @xmath104 where @xmath105 stands for a polynomial of @xmath68 and @xmath106 .",
    "since @xmath28 , the conditions for ( [ eq : genterm ] ) to be co - linear with the bisectrix are : even @xmath107 , @xmath19 and @xmath108 .    to further illustrate this ,",
    "let us focus on one part of the second iterate of ( [ eq : varley1 ] ) , namely @xmath109}(x)=\\left\\ { \\begin{tabular}{ll }        $ \\cdots , $ & $ \\cdots $ \\\\        $ r^{2-b}x^{(1-b)^2},$ & $ c",
    "< x < r / c$ , $ c<\\sqrt{r}$       \\end{tabular }       \\right.\\ ] ] where the dots stand for the three remaining terms and intervals in the definition of the second iterate . the explicit term of @xmath101}$ ] written down in ( [ eq : iter2 ] )",
    "is co - linear with the bisectrix in the cobweb plot if and only if @xmath19 , as expected , provided @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath111 the extremes of the interval collapse to a single point and that particular piece disappears in the second iterate .    in principle",
    ", several iterates can have co - linear terms simultaneously for the same value of @xmath31 .",
    "this gives rise to coexisting cycles of different periods , a fact that is illustrated in the bifurcation diagram of figure [ fig : peradding ] .",
    "there we have coded in color ( gray tone ) the periods of the trajectories , with fixed values @xmath112 .",
    "the representation is given in terms of @xmath113 , which endows the plot with more symmetric structure .",
    "the intermingling of the colored rhombuses accounts for the coexistence of limit cycles with various periods .",
    "in addition , horizontal dashed ( color ) segments stand for cycles whose periods are indicated by circled numbers and have been taken from table [ tab : t ] . framed numbers indicate the corresponding period of orbits in rhombuses . as figure",
    "[ fig : peradding ] shows , for the parameter values considered , only two different iterates can have co - linear terms for the same value of @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath33 increases , more co - linear terms of successively higher iterates emerge whereas the co - linear terms of the previous iterates collapse and disappear ( see [ app : bookkeeping ] ) .    in other words ,",
    "the presence of the @xmath114 power - law piece in the definition of the vgh model is at the origin of the bifurcation at @xmath19 . more generally , any one - dimensional map defined as a piecewise function , with a power - law piece in its definition , is a candidate to exhibit a bifurcation of the present type .      as is well known , for a continuous unimodal uniparametric map with its maximum at @xmath115 , the plot of the successive iterates of the initial seed @xmath116 versus the map parameter generates the so - called harter boundaries @xcite . in the logistic map",
    "@xcite , for instance , they correspond to the sharp cusps observed in the invariant density .",
    "these boundaries are , to some extent , the skeletal system of the bifurcation diagram where they are readily observed provided it is built up using color or grey tones .",
    "harter lines cross at unstable equilibrium points and , in the case of the logistic map , the set of crossing points follows itself a reversed bifurcation cascade .    the vgh map is not differentiable at @xmath65 , although it is still unimodal in the sense of being monotonically increasing for @xmath117 and decreasing for @xmath118 . a similar study to the one described for the logistic map leads to interesting results . to be precise , harter lines correspond to the color boundaries visible in figures [ fig : v_r2_bif - b ] and [ fig : v_c25_r2_xly ] .",
    "they can be directly established from the form ( [ eq : varley1 ] ) of the map .",
    "it is nevertheless simpler to use instead ( [ eq : zlog ] ) and the results gathered in [ app : lin ] . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the seed @xmath90 ends up in a cycle whose period @xmath119 depends on @xmath3 and @xmath31 .",
    "the expression for @xmath120 and the cycle elements may be explicitly written down .",
    "for @xmath121 the 2-cycle @xmath122 is reached just after one iteration . for @xmath123",
    ", @xmath65 is always a periodic point .",
    "obviously @xmath124 belongs to the 2-cycle @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath92 there is a unique integer @xmath126 such that @xmath127 with @xmath128 in terms of the integer part or floor function .",
    "then , for @xmath92 we get two cases @xmath129 the @xmath130-points of the cycle for the case ( [ eq : c - periodo3 ] ) read @xmath131 which in turn , for @xmath132 ( _ i.e. _ , case ( [ eq : c - periodo2 ] ) ) contract to the @xmath133-points cycle @xmath134    it is interesting to observe that ( [ eq : longperiod ] ) can be obtained recurrently from @xmath135 by a simple procedure . in going from @xmath136 to @xmath137 two new elements",
    "are added to the cycle : the one in the leftmost position is obtained by dividing by @xmath3 the first element in the previous cycle .",
    "the other , which goes at the rightmost position , is obtained by multiplying by @xmath3 the last element of the previous cycle .",
    "the dependence of the system with respect to the parameter @xmath31 with @xmath3 fixed , or equivalently @xmath33 , exhibits a large variety of features .",
    "we describe the system in the chaotic regime . first near the bifurcation point @xmath19 , and next for higher @xmath68 .      in figure",

    "its value changes suddenly at every band merging crisis observed in the bifurcation diagram .    to study the diagram with further detail we present in figures [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom ]  [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom - l ] magnifications of small areas in figure [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly ] .",
    "the region with @xmath49 , near @xmath19 , has further interesting features .",
    "thus , what in figure [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly ] appears as two dense chaotic bands does have structure when minutely examined .",

    "this thin window is composed by twenty two chaotic narrow bands ( only five in the zoom ) .",
    "further , the crossing of harter lines in figure [ fig : harter ] punctuate the start and end of the shrunk chaotic bands .",
    "a unstable orbit exists inside the window , which is represented by the dashed lines in the figure [ fig : harter ] .",
    "consequently , what we observe in figure [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom - r ] as a shrinking and widening of the attractor corresponds , actually , to a pair of interior crisis @xcite . moreover , further interior crises of various smaller sizes appear inside the window itself in a , possibly , self - similar way .",
    "for instance , in the leftmost part of this bifurcation diagram ( @xmath141 ) one can hint a crisis of the very same kind .",
    "figure [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom - l ] corresponds to a zoom of the left and uppermost part of the bifurcation diagram in figure [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom ] .",
    "the lyapunov exponent in the upper panel shows oscillations at band merging crises and , once again , a plateau ( only visible in the inset ) at the crisis located at @xmath142 .",
    "an explanation for the occurrence of @xmath54 plateaus is deferred to section [ sec : plateaus ] .    for @xmath92 and",
    "close to the critical point @xmath19 , the crises take place at integer values of @xmath33 .",
    "this feature is illustrated in figure [ fig : v_ly_collapse ] .",
    "the left panel shows @xmath54 as a function of @xmath31 for @xmath138 and three different values of @xmath3 .",
    "the right panel corresponds to the same data expressed in terms of @xmath33 : all three curves collapse onto a master curve .",
    "furthermore , the value of the lyapunov exponent is invariant also in magnitude .",
    "this property fades as far as we move toward higher values of @xmath68 , namely far from the critical point .",
    "all this buttresses the existence of universality in the system near the transition order - to - chaos .",
    "bifurcation diagrams of the vgh system always collapse when expressed in terms of @xmath32 versus @xmath33 .",
    "this is true even far from @xmath19 , in contrast with the lyapunov exponent diagrams .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : v_c_b21_r4 ] gives a view of the bifurcation diagram near @xmath124 , with @xmath139 and @xmath143 , i.e. leaving the critical point .",
    "the upper panel shows an enlargement of the region located by the arrow below .",
    "this is again an instance of interior crisis .",
    "concomitantly , the uppermost panel shows the variation of the lyapunov exponent . at variance with figures [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom][fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly_zoom - l ] , here @xmath54 exhibits neither jumps nor plateaus across the window where the attractor shrinks .",
    "the reason is explained in the next subsection .",
    "in the bifurcation diagram of figure [ fig : v_c_b22_r2 ] , with @xmath76 and @xmath74 , the band merging phenomenon is more involved than in figure [ fig : v_b201_r4_bif_ly ] .",
    "the corresponding lyapunov exponent , in the upper panel , exhibits large variations at crises too . however , these do not take place any longer at integer values of @xmath33 .",
    "eventually , in figure [ fig : v_b3_bif - l ] , where @xmath144 , we observe that the lyapunov exponent presents a large plateau whereas in the corresponding bifurcation diagram no interior crisis occurs .",
    "we have not found a justification for this case .",
    "an plausible explanation for the origin of @xmath54 plateaus occurring between interior crises pairs reads as follows .",
    "according to our numerical simulations , the narrow windows between interior crises of the vgh map resemble very much the so - called cycles of chaotic intervals , where the trajectories jump in a cyclic way from one chaotic band to another .",
    "such a phenomenon occurs , for instance , in the logistic map @xcite and is also termed in the literature as cyclic chaotic attractor or cyclic chaotic bands @xcite .",
    "trajectories look quite regular and , if the line @xmath145 in the bifurcation diagram does not cross any of the thin bands inside the window , then the proportion of exterior points ( @xmath58 ) remains almost constant . as a consequence of it and taking into account the interpretation of @xmath54 for this map at the end of section [ sec : lyap ]",
    ", the lyapunov exponent gets the plateau shape .",
    "otherwise , @xmath54 varies across the window , which is the case in figure [ fig : v_c_b21_r4 ] .",
    "next we gather some results , obtained from numerical simulations , concerning the behavior of trajectories around interior crises .",
    "we commence by pointing out that interior crises in the vgh map appear in pairs .",
    "as the parameter @xmath31 increases through a star value @xmath146 the chaotic attractor suddenly shrinks into thin chaotic bands .",
    "this is the first interior crisis .",
    "then , it exists a second star value @xmath147 where the set of thin bands suddenly widen and the attractor at @xmath148 recovers its old size .",
    "this is the second interior crisis of the pair .",
    "by contrast , in the logistic map , a tangent bifurcation precedes always an interior crises @xcite .    for values of @xmath31 slightly different than a star value , in the region where the attractor widens ( @xmath149 ) , the orbits spend long stretches in the region where the attractor is confined between the two crises . occasionally , the trajectories burst and visit the whole attractor . this behavior , termed crisis - induced intermittency @xcite ,",
    "is illustrated in figure [ fig : v_intermit ] .",
    "there , two orbits are plotted for slightly different values @xmath150 and @xmath151 , located at both sides of the star value @xmath152 .",
    "the empty square symbols stand for a trajectory in a regime where the attractor is still large .",

    "it seems , at first glance , a period-8 orbit but the inset , which is a zoom of just one single narrow band , allows us to illustrate its non - periodic character .    for fixed @xmath31 ,",
    "the statistics of the length of stretches where the orbit stays confined in the region of the shrunk attractor is well described by an exponential distribution , provided @xmath153 is small , which yields a characteristic length @xmath154 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for a large class of dynamical systems which exhibit crises , the dependence reads @xmath155 indeed , this is the case for the vgh map .",
    "we have built up the statistics of @xmath156 as a function of @xmath153 for the case in figure [ fig : v_intermit ] .",
    "the results are given in figure [ fig : tauvsdist ] .",
    "the linear fit in log - log scales yields a determination of the critical exponent : @xmath157 .      version ( [ eq : zlog ] ) of the map presents a worth mentioning numerical nuisance .",
    "namely , for some integer values of @xmath16 , computer generated trajectories collapse to an unstable periodic orbit after some iterations .",
    "a similar nature numerical artifact has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics for real @xmath32 may be viewed as follows .",
    "for an initial point @xmath158 , every iteration conveys a shift to the right by two units until the condition @xmath59 is fulfilled . the second line in ( [ eq : zlog ] ) may be read as : @xmath159 .",
    "thus , for integer @xmath16 the quantity in brackets is an integer and hence , its successive iteration conveys just a shift , as above .",
    "the key point is that , for finite machine precision , the last term dramatically looses precision in each iteration for some particular integer values of @xmath16 .",
    "this effect may be understood on the basis of a generalization of the bernoulli or binary shift map : @xmath160 . to this end , let us use the binary representation of the number @xmath161 .",
    "multiplication in base @xmath162 is very simple in some cases .",
    "for instance , when @xmath163 we get the binary representation of the product @xmath164 simply by shifting @xmath165 places to the left every bit and ( due to the finite precision of the computer ) adding simultaneously @xmath165 zeros to the right of the number . henceforth this number gets shifted by two units in every iteration till it reaches @xmath59 when the @xmath166 operator acts again .",
    "this way , the piece in bracket is preserved as an integer under the action of the floor function , whereas the term @xmath167 looses significant digits before going through the loop again .",
    "eventually it stops when , after a number of iterations , @xmath168 .",
    "at this point the iteration reduces to a periodic orbit with elements located at integer numbers .",
    "the full output is then a set of limit cycles whose elements are always integers .",
    "this misleading result is just consequence of the computer finite precision .",
    "we have revisited a one - dimensional population model , proposed as an instance of density dependent dynamics .",
    "the fitness parameter @xmath68 controls the onset of chaos .",
    "values @xmath16 convey chaos .",
    "otherwise the system is regular . on the critical point @xmath19",
    "the attractor is made of an infinity of limit cycles that share a finite number of different periods .",
    "hence , the transition order - to - chaos takes place through three steps : _ i _ ) finite number of limit cycles at @xmath17 ; _ ii _ ) infinite number of limit cycles with finite number of different periods at @xmath19 ; and _ iii _ ) chaos at @xmath16 .",
    "no period doubling occurs in this route to chaos . at @xmath19 ,",
    "we have given an exact description of the system .",
    "we have checked that such regular attractors have been sometimes plotted in bifurcation diagrams in the literature .",
    "however we have not found the concurrent descriptions of the attractor .",
    "moreover , bifurcation diagrams may be found in the literature where this attractor lacks , most likely because too few initial seeds were used in the computation .",
    "an explanation for the phenomenon to occur has been provided on the basis of the power - law tail of the map .",
    "the behavior of continuous piecewise linear maps has been studied in terms of the so - called border collision bifurcations .",
    "thus , a thorough classification of the different kinds of bifurcations , in the parameter space , is given in @xcite .",
    "the study explicitly excludes the borderline systems where a slope equals @xmath169 .",
    "interestingly , the vgh map in its version ( [ eq : zlog ] ) with @xmath170 @xmath171 , falls just into this category .",
    "a study of discontinuous maps @xcite , namely with @xmath172 ( or @xmath173 ) , is flawed by the same restriction .",
    "hence , the vgh map corresponds to a family of functions that are , by definition , out of those analyses .",
    "moreover , in view of the results given in section [ sec : explica ] , this type of bifurcation may endow that classification with further structure .",
    "an interesting phenomenon occurs close to the critical value , i.e. for @xmath174 .",
    "there , the lyapunov exponent of the vgh model exhibits renormalization features when expressed as a function of the variable @xmath33 . in turn , the bifurcation diagrams as a function of @xmath31 collapse for all @xmath3 and @xmath68 when expressed as @xmath175 .",
    "the abrupt variation of the lyapunov exponent near band merging crises has already been reported @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have observed plateaus in the lyapunov exponent , when represented as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that interior crises in the vgh map appear always in pairs .",
    "we think that the the presence of a power - law piece in maps like the vgh model studied here originates worth knowing properties .",
