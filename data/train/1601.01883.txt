    "following the successful developments in photonics during recent years , phononics is presently attracting considerable attention and is establishing itself as a promising area for future science and technological applications .",
    "the conventional way of controlling phonons takes advantage of size confinement.@xcite the advances in epitaxial crystal growth have made it possible to fabricate nanostructures with atomic dimensional control .",
    "these have been used to tailor the propagation properties of acoustic@xcite and optical@xcite phonons , as well as their interaction with optical fields .",
    "@xcite    one interesting question is whether optical phonons can also be controlled in a dynamic way by an external stimulus . to our knowledge ,",
    "only few approaches for active control of optical phonons have so far been proposed .",
    "one example is the modulation of the optical modes in strongly piezoelectric materials by an acoustic wave:@xcite here , the anisotropic strain field created by the sub - mhz bulk acoustic wave has been shown to reduce the crystal symmetry , thus introducing changes in the raman scattering from optical phonons .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that surface acoustic waves ( saws ) provide a convenient tool for the dynamic manipulation of optical phonons in semiconducting materials .",
    "the saws used here are elastic surface vibrations in the ghz range , which are electrically excited on the semiconductor surface using interdigital transducers .",
    "we demonstrate that the raman spectrum from optical phonons in si and gan crystals becomes modified in the presence of a saw with a wavelength @xmath1 of a few @xmath0 m . for both materials ,",
    "the changes in the raman cross - section are on the order of 0.1% .",
    "a systematic study shows that the saw - induced modifications in the raman intensity and line shape are due to two mechanisms .",
    "the first is the periodic modulation of the optical phonon energy by the saw strain field .",
    "since the energy shifts are much smaller than the raman line width , this mechanism leads to an apparent broadening of the raman line recorded in continuous - wave ( cw ) experiments .",
    "in addition to the previous contribution , which is of local nature , the raman experiments give evidence for a weaker and non - local contribution arising from the spatial variation of the saw fields .",
    "the latter induces scattering events , which activate modes with large wave vectors and , consequently , lower energies of the convex optical phonon dispersion of the crystal .",
    "the experimental raman profiles are well reproduced by quantitative models for the two contributions .",
    "the results prove , therefore , the feasibility of optical phonons manipulation by saws with @xmath0 m wavelengths .    in the remaining of this manuscript",
    ", we first describe the sample preparation and the experimental setup to record the changes in the raman spectrum by saws .",
    "we then present experimental results obtained for both si and gan crystals . in a subsequent discussion section , we develop a theoretical model for the acoustic modulation and compare it to the experimental findings .",
    "the last section summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "the studies were carried out on electronic quality ( 001 ) si and ( 0001 ) gan substrates containing interdigital transducers ( idts , see fig .",
    "1 ) for the excitation of saws fabricated by optical lithography . the split - finger idts were designed to launch saws with an acoustic wavelength @xmath2 m along a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) surface direction of the si ( gan ) wafer , respectively . in the case of si , saw excitation was enabled by coating the substrates with a 300 nm - thick piezoelectric zno film produced by magnetron sputtering prior to the idt deposition .",
    "the corresponding idt resonance frequencies at room temperature are 746 mhz and 1390 mhz for si and gan , respectively .",
    "the raman scattering studies were performed at room temperature in the backscattering configuration using a confocal horiba - labram system .",
    "the incident light from a 473 nm solid - state laser was focused by a 50@xmath5 long working distance objective with a numerical aperture ( na ) of 0.55 on a small spot ( diameter of approx",
    ". 1  @xmath0 m , which is much smaller than @xmath1 ) on the sample surface .",
    "the backscattered light was collected by the same objective , spectrally analyzed by a monochromator with a dispersion grating with 2400 grooves / mm , and detected using a liquid - nitrogen cooled charge coupled device ( ccd ) .",
    "the changes in the raman intensity induced by saw are very small ( on the order of @xmath6 ) .",
    "special precautions are thus required to discriminate the saw - induced changes from variations arising from fluctuations in laser fluency and temperature ( caused , for instance , by heating due to the application of radio - frequency ( _ rf _ ) nominal peak power of typically 23  dbm to the idt ) . for that purpose",
    ", we used a modulation detection scheme similar to the ones described in ref .  .",
    "in this approach , both the excitation laser and the _ rf_-power for saw generation are on / off amplitude modulated at a frequency of 617  hz .",
    "raman spectra @xmath7 were then recorded with the light and _ rf_-modulation in phase ( denoted as _ saw - on _ condition ) and out - of - phase ( _ saw - off _ condition ) with an integration time per measurement @xmath8  min .",
    "the following periodic recording sequence with four steps per cycle @xmath9 was used : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . this sequence",
    "is then repeated over @xmath14 cycles leading to a total accumulation time of typically four hours . from the individual spectra",
    "we have determined the average raman intensities in the saw - on and saw - off conditions , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . from these two spectra",
    ", we then directly determined the total @xmath17 and the differential raman spectrum defined as @xmath18 .",

    "the maximum modulation amplitude reaches @xmath25 and @xmath33  % of @xmath31 for si and gan , respectively , and reduces when the excitation frequency shifts away from @xmath30 .        in order to demonstrate that the small changes in the raman cross - section are really due to the saw fields ,",
    "we have recorded differential raman spectra by placing the laser spot at different positions on the sample surface .",

    "note that a clear differential signal is only observed for the positions within the saw beams .",
    "furthermore , the temperature at all spots due to saw excitation should be approximately the same since their separation is much smaller than the dimensions of the idt . the different line shape and the small amplitude of the signals recorded at @xmath36 and @xmath35 thus prove that the differential technique described in the previous section effectively corrects for temperature variations .",
    "the differential raman spectra @xmath38 are characterized by a pronounced negative dip at the central raman frequency with asymmetric flanks at @xmath30 , which indicates a preferential transfer of oscillator strength towards lower raman shifts . in order to extract quantitative information from the differential spectra in fig .",

    "the solid line reproduces the frequency dependence of the _ rf_-reflectivity of the idt ( corresponding to the _ rf_-scattering parameter @xmath45 ) with the characteristic dip within the frequency band for saw generation .",
    "the amplitude _ a _ reaches a maximum within the resonance frequency range of the idt . in the case of si , while @xmath39 reduces considerably away from @xmath30 , it does not vanish completely since the measured range of frequencies is not sufficiently far away from emission band of the idt . since the raman measurements were carried out very close to the idt ( approx .",
    "50  @xmath0 m away ) , the residual signal may also be due to the excitation of other ( non - saw ) acoustic modes by the idt .",
    "nevertheless , the results in figs .  [ figs11](a ) and [ figs11](b ) confirm that the changes in the raman spectra are due to the saw strain field .",
    "the zone center optical modes in si consist of one longitudinal ( lo ) and two transverse ( to ) modes . in the absence of a saw ,",
    "these three modes are degenerate , but only the lo mode is raman active in the backscattering configuration normal to the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "this mode propagates perpendicular to the surface with wave vector @xmath46 and energy given by the phonon dispersion @xmath47 . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath48 is the refractive index and @xmath49 the unitary vector along the surface normal , which corresponds to the @xmath50 direction .",
    "the acoustic field introduces a periodic time and spatial modulation of the optical phonon energies as well as of the dielectric properties of the medium .",
    "since the saw frequency is much smaller than the optical frequencies , we can safely assume that the optical phonon frequencies adiabatically follow the acoustic modulation .",
    "the acoustic modulation affects the spectral shape of the differential raman spectra in two different ways .",
    "first , the strain field periodically modulates the optical phonon energies . since the energetic shifts are much smaller than the spectral width of the raman line , the main effect in the time integrated raman spectrum is to transfer oscillator strength from the center to the flanks of the line .",
    "this mechanism is expected to produce a symmetric differential raman spectrum with a negative dip at the raman central frequency and positive values at the flanks , in agreement with the line shape of eq .",
    "( [ eqfit ] ) for @xmath51 .",
    "this lineshape qualitatively reproduces the main features of the data in fig .",
    "[ figspectra ] .",
    "in addition to the symmetric contribution described above , the differential raman spectra also show an asymmetric contribution yielding a stronger intensity at low raman shifts .",
    "the spatially resolved plots of fig .",
    "[ figpos ] show that this contribution can not explained by changes in temperature induced by saw excitation .",
    "we attribute this contribution to phonon scattering processes arising from the spatial modulation of the refractive index and phonon energies by the saw field .",
    "this non - local mechanism reduces the crystal translation invariance symmetry and induces ( i ) a mixing of the to and lo modes of the undisturbed crystal and ( ii ) the coupling of dispersion modes @xmath52 with different @xmath53 s . due to the negative curvature of the optical phonon dispersion ,",
    "the last mechanism transfers oscillator strength from the high to the low frequency flank of the raman line , thus leading to an asymmetric contribution to @xmath54 .",
    "such a process has been invoked to account for the raman line shape for nanocrystals .",
