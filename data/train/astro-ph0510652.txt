    "the am canum venaticorum ( am cvn ) class of ultracompact binaries provides an opportunity for probing the accretion - induced heating of a white dwarf ( wd ) over six orders of magnitude in the time - averaged accretion rate , @xmath1 . in these very tight ( @xmath8 min ) binaries ( see warner 1995 for an overview ) , the donor star is a very low mass ( @xmath9 ) helium wd and the accretor is either a he or a c / o wd .",
    "though there are a few distinct am cvn formation scenarios ( e.g. nelemans et al . 2001 and references therein ) , they all evolve as mass - transferring binaries driven by the loss of angular momentum from gravitational radiation ( e.g. deloye , bildsten & nelemans 2005 ) .",
    "this paper is an outgrowth of townsley and bildsten s ( 2004 , hereafter tb ) work on the reheating of wds in h - accreting cataclysmic variables .",
    "however , the case of wd reheating in am cvn binaries is different because the accreted material is pure helium , making flashes an isolated rather than constant occurence , and the binary evolution proceeds only under angular momentum loss by gravitational radiation , leading to a plummeting @xmath1 with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we have found that the wd is heated in the earliest phases of binary evolution and cools at later times .",
    "there is a critical decoupling accretion rate of @xmath10 below which the reheated wd will cool even while accreting .",
    "we find the amount of time that has passed since the binary had this @xmath1 by using the evolutionary calculations of deloye et al .",
    "simple cooling after this point predicts the wd luminosity , as well as the expected wd @xmath0 and absolute visual magnitude , @xmath6 ( assuming , of course , a wd mass , @xmath11 , and radius , @xmath12 ) .",
    "we show that the accreting wd can become the dominant broadband optical light source in those binaries with orbital periods in excess of @xmath13 minutes .    in  2",
    ", we discuss the physics of the wd heating due to accretion and discuss the uncertainty in the total helium layer mass expected on the wd . since the wd luminosity , @xmath14 , is nearly always less than the accretion luminosity , @xmath15 , we explain in  3 how the binary s behavior allows the wd to be directly detected at different orbital periods . at early times , during direct impact accretion ( e.g. marsh and steeghs 2002 ) , the unpulsed uv / optical light is from the hot wd , whereas at longer orbital periods , the disk is often quiescent , allowing for the underlying wd to dominate the optical continuum of a number of these binaries .",
    "we also speculate on what could be learned if one of these wds was caught in the db pulsational instability strip .",
    "we make direct comparisons to the observations in  4 , and conclude in  5 .",
    "the ability for accretion to heat the deep interior of a wd has been discussed extensively ( sion 1991 ; tb ) .",
    "indeed , accretion of pure helium at rapid rates @xmath16 is known to flash unstably and was studied as a type ia progenitor scenario ( e.g. nomoto & sugimoto 1977 ; nomoto 1982 ; woosley & weaver 1994 ) . though eventually ruled out as a major mechanism for type ia supernovae ( solheim & yungelson 2005 ) , am cvn binaries accrete pure helium for a long enough time to reheat the accreting wd .",
    "an additional feature of these binaries is the large dynamic range in the time averaged accretion rate , @xmath1 , onto the wd , allowing us to test the theories of re - heated wds , as discussed in  3 & 4 .",
    "here we calculate the accretor s thermal evolution along with that of the binary for several am cvn systems that represent the expected ranges for this population .",
    "motivated by the expected mass distribution of he wd donors that evolve into am cvn systems ( nelemans et al .",
    "2001 ) , we chose an initial donor mass of @xmath17 .",
    "the thermal state of the donor is very important for setting the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( bildsten 2002 ; deloye & bildsten 2003 ; deloye et al .",
    "2005 ) . for this study we chose two thermal states found by setting the initial entropy of the donor so that the system s @xmath2 at contact is greater than the @xmath2 at contact of 30% and 90% of the systems in the deloye et al .",
    "( 2005 ) am cvn population evolution calculation .",
    "this provides @xmath1 as a function of time , and we then use the quasi - static envelope methods of tb to heat the accreting wd . for simplicity , this evolution is performed at constant @xmath11 and with a constant helium layer .",
    "we chose two masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 , each case with a @xmath20 accreted helium shell ( justified below ) .",
    "initial @xmath11 values for the binary evolution were chosen such that @xmath21 matched that of the thermal calculations at late times ( long @xmath2 ) to ensure the correct @xmath2-time relation .",
    "using these @xmath1 trajectories ( see figure 1 ) , we identified four relevant regimes for the state of the accreting wd .",
    "chronologically since initiation of mass transfer ( and in order of decreasing @xmath1 ) , these are : ( 1 ) rapid accretion and thermally unstable he ignition ( @xmath22 ) , ( 2 ) core heating during a phase in which @xmath14 is determined from `` compressional '' heating in the wd envelope ( @xmath23 ) , ( 3 ) a transition period where the core temperature is near an equilibrium value set by @xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) , and ( 4 ) the wd cooling regime ( @xmath25 ) where @xmath14 is determined by the time , @xmath26 , since the heating stopped at a previous epoch where @xmath27 , the decoupling mass - transfer rate .",
    "we now describe each regime .    at the very earliest times , when @xmath28 , the accreted helium is compressed rapidly and ignites in a thermally unstable manner , leading to recurrent weak explosions ( fujimoto & sugimoto 1982 ) .",
    "( where @xmath29amu is the energy released from helium fusion ) only appear at the brief ( @xmath30 yr ) and poorly understood onset of accretion . ]",
    "it is uncertain how much of the accreted material is ejected ( see kato & hachisu 1999 ) .",
    "as @xmath1 drops , the compression happens more slowly so that the envelope temperature is lower , and the helium shell can become quite large . thermal instabilities at this stage likely lead to detonations ( fujimoto & sugimoto 1982 ) , such that the last thermonuclear instability might be the most violent .",
    "however , once @xmath31 , the required unstable he ignition mass for @xmath32 wds ( nomoto 1982 ; limongi & tornambe 1991 ; goriely et al .",
    "2002 ) exceeds the donor mass .",
    "thus once a system reaches an orbital period of 10 minutes , it is unlikely to undergo further unstable helium ignition events .",
    "that is , @xmath1 drops quickly enough that once @xmath1 is low enough for a strong flash , the accreted layer never becomes thick enough for it to occur . over the remaining course of the binary s evolution , about @xmath33",
    "is accreted by the wd , motivating us to use a fixed accreted layer mass of @xmath34 to calculate the thermal evolution of the accretor .",
    "because @xmath14 depends only logarithmically on the accreted layer mass ( tb ) , using this fixed value has only a small impact , especially when compared to the large variations in @xmath14 from the orders of magnitude variation in @xmath1 .    the period of time during which @xmath35 yr@xmath36 is so short ( @xmath37 yr ) that the accretor s core is thermally unperturbed from its initial state .",
    "however , once the helium layer begins to accumulate , thermal diffusion both out of the surface ( setting the exiting luminosity , @xmath14 ) and into the core ( acting to increase the temperature there , @xmath38 ) occurs .",
    "we thus begin evolving the wd s thermal state @xmath39 yr after contact .",
    "although the compressional energy release depends weakly on the accumulated he layer mass ( i.e. logarithmically , tb ) , the @xmath14-@xmath38 relation which determines the cooling is essentially independent of it . the evolution is shown in figure 1 and exhibits all of the epochs ( 2)-(4 ) including reheating , decoupling and cooling . the heat capacity and",
    "crystallized fraction of the core was calculated using the equation of state of potekhin & chabrier ( 2000 ) , and the late - time @xmath14-@xmath38 relation ( in the limit of minimal accretion ) was adapted from hansen ( 1999 ) .",
    "we have included a latent heat of crystallization of @xmath40 per particle , but no fractionation .    at early times in the evolution ,",
    "the wd core temperature , @xmath38 , is much lower than the maximum temperature reached at the base of the outer radiative envelope , @xmath41 . in this limit , tb showed that @xmath14 becomes independent of @xmath38 and is only a function of @xmath1 and @xmath11 .",
    "they found that the envelope state is determined self consistently by balancing the heat released in the outer ( non - degenerate ) envelope due to fluid motion down the entropy gradient , @xmath42 , with that carried through the envelope by radiative transfer @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mean molecular weight in the he envelope , @xmath45 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath46 is the baryon mass .",
    "this same state applies here when @xmath47 and we have calculated this balance numerically using the quasi - static envelope methods outlined in tb for he accretion and found , @xmath48 this relation holds for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , although for our time histories @xmath51 by the time @xmath52 so that this form only applies to figure 1 for @xmath53 . during this early phase , the wd core is being heated as @xmath1 is dropping .",
    "as the starting wd mass , when @xmath54 and the accreted layer is thin , their values are as much as a factor of 50 lower for @xmath55 yr@xmath36 .",
    "we believe that @xmath14 , which is largely due to compressional heat release in the outer layers and was only of peripheral interest in their study , is not well determined by their modeling for small accreted layer masses at @xmath56 . ]    as @xmath1 drops and @xmath38 increases , the accreting wd approaches the equilibrium state where the outgoing luminosity is matched by the internal energy release ( nomoto 1982 ; tb ) .",
    "there is a brief transition from core heating to cooling which appears in figure 1 as a plateau in @xmath38 . in the equilibrium state ,",
    "a fairly good estimate of the compressional heating luminosity is found by integrating throughout the @xmath20 accreted degenerate he layer ( identical to that performed in appendix b of tb , and nomoto 1982 ) , giving @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the ion mean molecular weight in the helium envelope . as @xmath1 continues to drop",
    ", this will eventually become low enough that it is exceeded by the core cooling luminosity @xmath59 . at this point the wd evolution",
    "_ decouples _ from @xmath1 and cools much as an isolated object would . by setting @xmath60 and taking @xmath61 - 2@xmath62 k",
    ", we find @xmath63-@xmath64 yr@xmath36 . these values are evident in figure 1 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath65 at the plateau depends on the initial @xmath38 and when the he flashes cease , neither of which is well known .",
    "this leads to some uncertainty in @xmath14 at the time of decoupling .",
    "however , analogous to isolated cooling wds , the `` initial '' @xmath65 is forgotten , and @xmath14 eventually only depends on the time after decoupling , @xmath26 .",
    "this is simply the wd cooling age from the time that heating ceased .",
    "by @xmath66 yr , @xmath67 , already consistent with a cooling db wd of a similar age ( hansen 1999 ) .    using the values tabulated by limongi & tornambe ( 1991 ,",
    "hereafter lt91 ) for accretion of helium onto a @xmath68 wd at a fixed rate , we find that our determination of the heating time from the quasi - static model agrees well with their full numerical model .",
    "table 2 in lt91 gives a detail of @xmath69 ( the maximum with respect to radius ) and @xmath70 for a mass history starting from @xmath68 up to about @xmath71 .",
    "we compare our @xmath72 for a 0.9@xmath73 wd with a @xmath20 helium layer accreting at a constant rate to @xmath74 ( representative of the heat content ) from table 2 of lt91 , and find that in both cases , for this range of mass , @xmath75 is approxmately constant .",
    "we find @xmath76 k @xmath77 and @xmath78 k @xmath77 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively , compared to the values of @xmath81 k @xmath77 and @xmath82 k @xmath77 from lt91 . also , the @xmath65 reached in the plateau ( @xmath83 k ) reflects the equilibrium @xmath38 for the @xmath1 at this epoch @xmath84 .",
    "this is consistent with the typical values of interior temperatures , @xmath85 , found by lt91 for a @xmath68 co wd accreting helium steadily at @xmath86 .",
    "before core crystallization begins , the wd s heat capacity is well approximated by @xmath87 . with the simple relation @xmath88 , @xmath89 gives @xmath90 where @xmath91 is time in gyrs .",
    "this agrees well between decoupling and the onset of crystallization , which occurs at @xmath92 k for @xmath93 , corresponding to a time of @xmath94 yr and an orbital period of 60(45 ) minutes for the hot donor evolution .",
    "the effect of the latent heat release is visible in the @xmath38 history and the heavier wd cools more quickly at late times due to its earlier crystallization and the resulting decrease in total heat capacity .",
    "the modifications due to latent heat release change the @xmath95 relation to something closer to @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively in the 1 - 8 gyr region .",
    "by contrast , the accretion luminosity @xmath15 is a smooth power law after about @xmath98 yr , given by @xmath99 for @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : compare ]    the bottom panel of figure 1 shows the resulting @xmath100 , for which there is very little contrast with the donor entropies .",
    "however , when displayed as a function of the observable , @xmath2 ( see figure 2 ) , a contrast immediately appears : accretors in systems with hotter donors have higher @xmath0 s .",
    "the reason for this depends on the phase of evolution , but is essentially related to the difference in speed of evolution as set by the donor s @xmath11-@xmath12 relation . in the `` compressional heating ''",
    "phase a lower entropy donor always produces a lower @xmath1 at a given @xmath2 , leading to a lower @xmath14 . by an orbital period of 30 - 40 minutes",
    "the wd is cooling and the time since decoupling becomes larger than the uncertainty introduced by the unknown @xmath65 , so that at longer orbital periods we can safely predict @xmath14 .",
    "low - entropy donors reach the decoupling @xmath1 at shorter orbital periods and evolve more slowly in @xmath101 , so that the wds at a given @xmath2 always look `` older '' ( i.e. colder ) if their donor was initially of low entropy . the track for the cool donor ( 30th percentile ) gives a good maximum @xmath26 , which for @xmath102 min can be fit by @xmath103 , and thus yields the relation for the coldest possible @xmath104 wd at these orbital periods , @xmath105 .",
    "in order to assess the likelihood of observing the accreting wd , we must compare its luminosity to that from active accretion . when the wd is near equilibrium or simply emitting the compressional heating luminosity",
    ", @xmath106 will be much less than the accretion luminosity , @xmath107 , since @xmath108 .",
    "seeing the hot wd then depends on either geometry ( for example , an edge - on systmem like the newly discovered eclipsing binary sdss  j0926 + 3624 ; anderson et al .",
    "2005 ) or probes of different spectral regions .",
    "four classes among observed systems are delineated in table 1 by horizontal lines .",
    "the shortest period systems are in a phase where the accretion stream directly hits the wd ( e.g. marsh & steeghs 2002 ; israel et al . 2002 ) , providing the first opportunity . in this case",
    "there is no disc and there are times when the direct impact location is out of sight , providing an excellent chance to see the ( very hot ) accreting wd . at",
    "slightly longer @xmath2 , around 20 minutes , all systems are expected to have a consistently bright accretion disc in the optical / uv that would energetically dominate the wd ( e.g. nelemans et al . 2004 ) as noted above .",
    "indeed , nelemans et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that a simple accretion disc model at 15 minutes would give @xmath109 and temperatures of @xmath110 k , swamping the hot wd .",

    "although at this @xmath1 the disc absolute magnitude is expected to be brighter than the wd , the low state is a time when the accreting wd can be detected , just as in the hydrogen accreting cvs ( sion 1991 ; townsley & bildsten 2003 ) .",
    "the last group , with the longest orbital periods , again show hardly any brightness variations . in the context of the thermal instability interpretation , these systems could be on the lower , stable , branch of the instability curve and thus would be cool discs , consisting mainly of neutral helium . the steadily accreting luminosity is only @xmath126 times larger than the cooling wd ( see  2 ) , enhancing the prospects of seeing the accreting wd relative to shorter orbital periods , where the contrast is greater .",
    "in addition , the disc temperature will generally be cooler than the wd as shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 .",
    "in addition to directly seeing the re - heated wd in the am cvn binaries , there are also opportunities for seismological tests as the wd passes through the non - radial pulsation instability strip ( @xmath127 for isolated dbs ; beauchamp et al .",
    "1999 ) , which we plot in figure 2 .",
    "the pulsation periods are 200 - 1000 seconds ( see handler 2003 for a recent summary ) and are typically @xmath128 g - modes of high radial order ( e.g. kotak et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we do not know , _ a priori _ , that the instability strip will be the same for a he accreting wd .",
    "the clear structural difference in the accreting wd is the mass of the helium envelope , which will likely exceed @xmath20 and be seismically measurable .",
    "it seems unlikely that the thicker he envelope would alter the instability strip , since the relevant `` pump '' for the mode excitation occurs at low pressures ( see gautschy & althaus 2002 for a recent study ) .",
    "however , active accretion onto the outer atmosphere might make a difference , especially if the convection zone ( responsible for the mode excitation ; e.g. brickhill 1991 ) is altered .",
    "it also seems possible that the mode pump could become active during the cooling of the outer wd layers ( piro , arras & bildsten 2005 ) following an accretion disk outburst . indeed , wood et al .",
    "( 1987 ) reported excess power at periods of 100 - 200 seconds when cr boo had an optical magnitude of @xmath129 , which might well be the passing of the accreting wd through the instability strip following an accretion outburst .",
    "the most dramatic alteration of the g - mode frequencies would be from wd rotation at periods comparable to the g - mode periods , as the wd has accumulated a significant amount of mass and angular momentum since the last mass ejecting he novae event .",
    "this angular momentum either resides solely in the he layer or has been shared with the underlying c / o wd in the @xmath130 years spent at the @xmath131 minutes where @xmath0 is in the isolated db instability strip ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "motivated by the likelihood that very weak internal magnetic fields can easily mediate angular momentum transport on this timescale ( e.g. spruit 2002 ) , we presume that all accreted angular momentum after the last he novae event is shared with the whole wd , yielding a lower limit to the rotation frequency of the he shell , where much of the g - mode energy resides .",
    "we assume that helium accretes onto the wd with the specific angular momentum of the inner edge of the accretion disk , @xmath132 , and that the amount of accreted matter , @xmath133 .",
    "the final wd spin frequency is then @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the wd moment of inertia , yielding @xmath136 , @xmath137 which reaches about 100 seconds when @xmath138 .",
    "hence , it appears very likely that the wd surface layer ( and maybe even core ) is rotating rapidly enough ( i.e. @xmath139 ) that the seismology will be dramatically altered from the isolated db case .",
    "the discovery and study of a db pulsator in an am cvn binary would provide an unprecendented opportunity to measure the accumulated he layer mass on the c / o wd and the angular momentum transport mechanisms within it .",
    "the most probable orbital periods for this range from 20 to 35 minutes .",
    "the rapid surface rotation will broaden any spectral features originating there , as the resulting minimum equatorial rotational velocity is @xmath140 , nearly independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the narrow , central line emission ( i.e. spikes ) seen in he lines of gp com , ce 315 and sdss1240 ( marsh 1999 , ruiz et al , 2001 , roelofs et al , 2005a ) are generally believed to originate on the accreting wds . however , their widths are much less than this estimate , suggesting either a different origin or an effective loss of angular momentum from the rapidly spinning accretor .",
    "another difference with single db wds is that @xmath141n is present in the accreting material at a mass fraction of 1 - 2% ( due to cno burning in the progenitor star of the he donor ) .",
    "this @xmath141n would rapidly sink out of the wd photosphere were it not for the constant mixing provided by the underlying convection zone of mass @xmath142 .",
    "it is thus the sedimentation time , @xmath143 , at the base of the convection zone that sets the relevant timescale .",
    "paquette et al . ( 1986 ) calculated @xmath143 for @xmath141n in pure he atmospheres of isolated wds , and defined an @xmath144 , below which the @xmath141n in the convective envelope will be less abundant than in the accreting material . for @xmath145 wds , @xmath146 .",
    "though @xmath142 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath11 ( see fontaine & van horn 1976 ) , so does the sedimentation time , making the actual value of @xmath147 not too dependent on @xmath11 for the range of @xmath0 relevant here ( see figure 14 in paquette et al . 1986 ) .",
    "more recent calculations with updated opacities ( macdonald , hernanz , & jose 1998 ) found larger @xmath142 values by factors of 4 - 6 from paquette et al .",
    "hence , for @xmath148 minutes , the atmospheric n abundance will be comparable to that in the accreted material . at longer orbital periods , depending on the state of the donor , it seems plausible that @xmath1 will be less than @xmath149 , and the @xmath141n will tend to sediment .",
    "detection and study of atmospheric n ( i.e. not from the accretion disk ) in gp com , ce-315 and sdss j1240 could thus constrain the sedimentation physics .",
    "the abundant presence of @xmath141n may simplify the spectral modeling of these wds relative to what has been done for pure he atmospheres ( see bergeron , saumon & wesemael 1995a ) .",
    "this is because the low first ionization potential of @xmath141n will provide free electrons more readily than the he .",
    "this may well allow the @xmath150 free - free opacity to more readily dominate for the relevant @xmath0 s , but only calculations will tell .",
    "this could also alter the location of the pulsational instability strip .",

    "our high @xmath1 calculations allow us to address the direct impact scenario .",
    "even though the accreting material arrives over a limited part of the wd , we expect complete spreading by the time it has reached depths relevant for compressional heating ( piro & bildsten 2004 ) , thus allowing our calculation to apply . at the minimum @xmath160 expected for v407 vul ( see table 1 ) , we predict that @xmath161 . the predicted range of @xmath162 and absolute magnitude , @xmath163 .",

    "combined with the estimated @xmath163 , this suggests a distance greater than 500 pc if v407 vul is a direct impact accretor .    for rx  j0806.3 + 1527 ( @xmath157 min ) ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "the shorter orbital period implies a luminosity of @xmath165 , @xmath166k and @xmath167 for the accretor .",
    "the estimated @xmath0 agrees with the observed very blue spectrum , for which israel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a lower limit of 40,000 k. the apparent magnitude of 21.1 would put the system at 20 kpc , 8 kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "a similar distance is needed to interpret the rather low x - ray flux ( israel et al .",
    "2002 ) as being generated by @xmath1 .",
    "it was recently suggested that the low x - ray flux could be reconciled with much smaller distances due to a temporarily lower @xmath168 or due to most of the accretion luminosity being emitted in the uv ( marsh & nelemans 2005 ; willems & kalogera , 2005 ) .",
    "however , our calculations show that not only the x - ray luminosity , but also the optical flux tracks @xmath1 , so that the latter suggestion would still produce a much too bright wd . the compressional heating luminosity would track a drop in @xmath169 on the thermal time of the accreted layer , @xmath170 where @xmath41 is the maximum temperature , and @xmath14 is given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this timescale is much longer than the timescale for which a temporarily lower @xmath169 can be sustained ( @xmath171 yrs , marsh & nelemans 2005 ) , leading to a bright wd even at low @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , for rx  j0806.3 + 1527 to be a direct impact accretor , the only solution seems to be a very large distance .",
    "the third system in the table , es cet , is clearly a helium accreting wd .",

    "they interpret this as the size of the impact spot , but our calculations suggest that the whole wd should be very hot .",
    "this observed temperature is in the expected range , and the radius either suggests a massive ( @xmath174 ) wd or a less massive wd at a larger distance than they assumed .      for the outbursting systems",
    "the spectra are dominated by the accretion disc when they are in their high state .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the disc are at least 6  8 , much brighter than the expected absolute magnitudes of the accreting wds of about 11 ( figure 2 ) . however , in the low state , the wd can contribute significantly to the spectra , potentially producing the observed continuum . between 20 and 30 min , the expected disc absolute magnitude drops , while the wd @xmath6 stays roughly constant .",
    "interestingly , the magnitude range observed in these outbursting systems decreases with increasing orbital period .",
    "while cr boo has a range of 5 magnitudes , v803 cen is less , at 4.2 , and cp eri only changes by 3.2 magnitudes .",
    "to check if the low - state spectra could be dominated by the wd , we estimate the temperature from the shape of the 40006000    continuum from the few spectra that are available .",
    "we assume a black - body spectrum , which reasonably produces the broad band colors of theoretical db white dwarf spectra ( bergeron , wesemael & beauchamp 1995b ) .",
    "our temperature determinations in table 1 are accurate at about the 10% level k the black body colors overestimate @xmath0 by 5001000 k , while above that temperature they underestimate the temperature by a similar amount .",

    "boo and v803 cen , the absolute magnitudes are also known ( groot et al . in prep , see table 1 ) .    for cr boo and v803 cen , the temperatures are below the expected wd temperatures and indeed the absolute magnitudes in the low state are about 1 magnitude above the predicted wd brightness ( see figure 2 ) , suggesting a significant contribution from the disc ( which is cooler than the wd , but of larger area ) , even in the low - state . using the slope of spectrum in the low state",
    ", we found a temperature of @xmath176 for cp eri , whereas a recent uv spectrum suggests @xmath177 ( sion , priv .",
    "we have to be careful with these low - state estimates , though , as a second low - state spectrum of cr boo ( patterson et al . 1997 ) shows a very different continuum shape , suggesting a cool or hybrid cool plus hot spectrum .",
    "the recently discovered eclipsing am cvn binary , sdss  j0926 + 3624 , at @xmath178 ( anderson et al . 2005 ) provides an opportunity for probing the distinct contributions of the hot wd and the disk .",
    "anderson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) report that the @xmath179 minute duration of the eclipse is consistent with the @xmath180 secondary transiting a hot spot or the inner disk . it is also consistent with an eclipse of the hot wd .",
    "fast photometry and phase resolved spectroscopy could confirm that the wd contributes and would tie the eclipse minimum to the wd rather than the disk , yielding a more robust measurement of the orbital period change expected from gravitational wave driven mass transfer ( anderson et al . 2005 ) .      for gp com and ce 315 we derived the temperatures in the same way as described above and",
    "interpret the temperature as that of the accreting wd .",
    "for gp com , using the known distance ( d = 67 pc ; thorstensen 2003 ) , we can derive the emitting area .",
    "thorstensen ( 2003 ) gives a typical observed v magnitude of 16.1 , but warner ( 1995 ) lists the range 15.716.0 .",
    "we therefore use v=15.716.1 as the observed range . together with @xmath181 ( thorstensen 2003 )",

    "interestingly , two systems have been recently discovered that , in their low state , clearly show the broad absorption lines of a db white dwarf , with estimated temperature of 17,000 k ( sdss j1240 - 01 and sn2003aw , roelofs et al .",

    "based on an absolute magnitude of 11 ( fig .",

    "we have shown ( both from theory and observation ) that thermal emission from the accreting wd within an am cvn binary is an important contributor to the observed optical emission .",
    "for the direct impact systems with the shortest orbital periods , the hot wd is visible when the hot spot is out of the line of sight . at longer orbital periods ,",
    "the wd can either be seen when the disk is in a low state , or at even longer orbital periods ( @xmath7 min ) , the wd always dominates the accretion luminosity in the optical bandpass .",
    "we compared our theoretical results to the temperature and brightness of observed systems .",
    "the accreting wd is the dominant contributor to the optical light for the direct impact accretors and constrains their distances . in particular ,",
    "the expected brightness of the wd is so large for rx  j0806 that it can only be in the direct impact phase if it is located at a distance of 20 kpc , far outside the galactic disc . for @xmath188 ,",
    "our predicted absolute magnitude of the wd is @xmath189 .",
    "this allows for estimates of the distance to the two newly discovered am cvn systems ( 2003aw and sdssj1240 - 01 ) in which the db white dwarf is visible .",
    "the two outbursting systems ( cr boo and v803 cen ) with parallaxes have @xmath190 in quiescence , 1 magnitude brighter than our estimate for the wd .",
    "this suggests that even in the low state there is a disc contribution . for gp com and ce-315",
    ", a combination of estimated effective temperature and known distance suggests that the optical continuum emission is dominated by emission from the wd , in agreement with our calculations .",
    "for these two systems we find consistency with a hot ( high - entropy ) donor .",
    "whether this donor was born hot and has evolved at fairly constant entropy or is heated by ongoing processes is unknown but could be addressed by future theoretical work .    our successful comparisons to observations",
    "gives us confidence to apply our work to predict just how faint these binaries can become .",
    "for example , either mass wd reaches @xmath191 at 5 gyrs , and at 10 gyrs , the absolute magnitudes are @xmath192 .",
    "this will allow for meaningful constraints on the population density of such binaries from deep optical searches , both in the field ( e.g. the 3 additional candidates found by sdss , anderson et .",
    "al . 2005 ) and in globular clusters .",
    "much work remains to be done on the theoretical side , the most important of which is to resolve better the nature and occurrence rate of he flashes at early stages in the evolution of these binaries .",
    "in addition to better constraining the remaining he mass on the accreting wd at late times , it would also allow us to predict the he novae rate and potentially constrain the population from the measurements of such events .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic development would be the secure detection of non - radial oscillations in these wds , allowing for measurements of both the wd rotation rate and accumulated he layer mass .",
