    "the construction of quantum theories from classical theories , known as quantization , has a long and difficult history .",
    "it starts with the discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925 and the formalization of the quantization procedure by dirac and von neumann .",
    "the construction of a quantum theory from a given classical one is highly non - trivial and non - unique . but except for few examples , it is the only way which will be gone today . from a physical point of view , the world surround us is the result of an underlying quantum theory of its constituent parts",
    "so , one would expect that we must understand the transition from the quantum to the classical world .",
    "but we had developed and tested successfully the classical theories like mechanics or electrodynamics .",
    "therefore one tried to construct the quantum versions out of classical theories . in this paper",
    "we will go the other way to obtain a quantum field theory by geometrical methods and to show its equivalence to a quantization of a classical poisson algebra .",
    "the main technical tool will be the noncommutative geometry developed by connes @xcite",
    ". then intractable space like the leaf space of a foliation can be described by noncommutative algebras . from the physical point of view",
    ", we have now an interpretation of noncommutative algebras ( used in quantum theory ) in a geometrical context .",
    "so , we need only an idea for the suitable geometric structure . for that purpose one",
    "formally considers the path integral over spacetime geometries . in the evaluation of this",
    "integral , one has to include the possibility of different smoothness structures for spacetime @xcite .",
    "brans @xcite was the first who considered exotic smoothness also on open smooth 4-manifolds as a possibility for space - time .",
    "he conjectured that exotic smoothness induces an additional gravitational field ( _ brans conjecture _ ) .",
    "the conjecture was established by asselmeyer @xcite in the compact case and by sadkowski @xcite in the non - compact case .",
    "sadkowski @xcite discussed the influence of differential structures on the algebra @xmath11 of functions over the manifold @xmath12 with methods known as non - commutative geometry .",
    "especially in @xcite he stated a remarkable connection between the spectra of differential operators and differential structures .",
    "but there is a big problem which prevents progress in the understanding of exotic smoothness especially for the @xmath0 : there is no known explicit coordinate representation . as the result no exotic smooth function on any such @xmath0 is known even though there exist families of infinite continuum many different non diffeomorphic smooth @xmath0 .",
    "this is also a strong limitation for the applicability to physics of non - standard open 4-smoothness .",
    "bizaca @xcite was able to construct an infinite coordinate patch by using casson handles .",
    "but it still seems hopeless to extract physical information from that approach .",
    "this situation is not satisfactory but we found a possible solution .",
    "the solution is a careful analysis of the small exotic @xmath0 by using foliation theory ( see next section ) to derive a relation between exotic smoothness and codimension-1 foliations in section [ sec : exotic - r4-codim-1-foliation ] ( see theorem [ thm : codim-1-foli - radial - fam ] ) . by using noncommutative geometry ,",
    "this approach is able to produce a von neumann algebra via the leaf space of the foliation which can be interpreted as the observable algebra of some qft ( see @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , our approach to exotic smoothness is strongly connected with a codimension-1 foliation of type @xmath13 , i.e. the leaf space is a factor @xmath2 von neumann algebra .",
    "especially this algebra is the preferred algebra in the local algebra approach to qft @xcite .",
    "recently , this factor @xmath13 case was also discussed in connection with quantum gravity ( via the spectral triple of connes ) @xcite .    in the next two sections we will give an overview about foliation theory , its operator - theoretical description and the relation to exotic smoothness .",
    "both sections are rather technical with a strong overlap to our previous paper @xcite . in section [ sec : quantization ] we turn to the quantization procedure as related to nonstandard smoothings of @xmath0 .",
    "based on the dictionary between operator algebra and foliations one has the corresponding relation of small exotic @xmath0 s and operator algebras .",
    "this is a noncommutative @xmath14 algebra which can be seen as the algebra of quantum observables of some theory .    *",
    "first , in subsection [ sub : factor - iii - case ] we recognized the algebra as the hyperfinite factor @xmath2 von neumann algebra . from tomita - takesaki theory it follows that any factor @xmath13 algebra @xmath12 decomposes as a crossed product into @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a factor @xmath4 . via connes procedure",
    "one can relate the factor @xmath13 foliation to a factor @xmath17 foliation .",
    "then we obtain a foliation of the horocycle flow on the unit tangent bundle over some genus @xmath18 surface which determines the factor @xmath4 .",
    "this foliation is in fact determined by the horocycles which are closed circles .",
    "* next we are looking for a classical algebraic structure which would give the above mentioned noncommutative algebra of observables as a result of quantization .",
    "the classical structure is recovered by the idempotent of the @xmath14 algebra and has the structure of a poisson algebra .",
    "the idempotents were already constructed in subsection [ sub : smooth - holonomy - groupoid ] as closed curves in the leaf of the foliation of @xmath19 .",
    "as noted by turaev @xcite , closed curves in a surface induce a poisson algebra : given a surface @xmath5 let @xmath20 be the space of flat connections of @xmath21 bundles on @xmath5 ; this space carries a poisson structure as is shown in subsection [ sub : the - observable - algebra ] .",
    "the complex functions on @xmath22 can be considered as the algebra of classical observables forming the poisson algebra @xmath23 . * next in the subsection [ sub : drinfeld - turaev - quantization ] we find a quantization procedure of the above poisson algebra which is the drinfeld - turaev deformation quantization .",
    "it is shown that the result of this quantization is the skein algebra @xmath24)$ ] for the deformation parameter @xmath25 ( @xmath26 corresponds to the commutative poisson structure on @xmath27 ) . *",
    "this skein algebra is directly related to the factor @xmath2 von neumann algebra derived from the foliation of @xmath19 .",
    "in fact the skein algebra is constructed in subsection [ sub : temperley - lieb - algebra - foliation ] as the factor @xmath9 algebra morita equivalent to the factor @xmath4 which in turn determines the factor @xmath2 of the foliation .    finally in section [ sec :",
    "knots - as - states ] we discuss the states of the algebra and the operators between states . here , we present only the ideas : the states are knots represented by holonomies along a flat connection .",
    "then an operator between two states is a knot concordance ( a kind of knot cobordism ) .",
    "the whole approach is similar to the holonomy flux algebra of loop quantum gravity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss this interesting relation in our forthcoming work .",
    "in this section we will consider a foliation @xmath28 of a manifold @xmath12 , i.e. an integrable subbundle @xmath29 of the tangent bundle @xmath30 .",
    "the leaves @xmath31 of the foliation @xmath28 are the maximal connected submanifolds @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "we denote with @xmath34 the set of leaves or the leaf space .",
    "now one can associate to the leaf space @xmath34 a @xmath35algebra @xmath36 by using the smooth holonomy groupoid @xmath37 of the foliation ( see connes @xcite ) . for a codimension-1 foliation of a 3-manifold @xmath12",
    "there is the godbillon - vey invariant @xcite as element of @xmath38 .",
    "as example we consider the construction of a codimension-1 foliation of the 3-sphere by thurston @xcite which will be used extensively in the paper .",
    "this foliation has a non - trivial godbillon - vey invariant where every element of @xmath39 is represented by a cobordism class of foliations .",
    "hurder and katok @xcite showed that the @xmath35algebra of a foliation with non - trivial godbillon - vey invariant contains a factor @xmath13 subalgebra . in the following",
    "we will construct this @xmath35algebra and discuss the factor @xmath13 case .",
    "a codimension @xmath40 foliation of an @xmath41-manifold @xmath42 ( see the nice overview article @xcite ) is a geometric structure which is formally defined by an atlas @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , such that the transition functions have the form @xmath45\\quad.\\ ] ] intuitively , a foliation is a pattern of @xmath46-dimensional stripes - i.e. , submanifolds - on @xmath42 , called the leaves of the foliation , which are locally well - behaved .",

    "the complementary bundle @xmath49 is the normal bundle of @xmath47 .",
    "such foliations are called regular in contrast to singular foliations or haefliger structures . for the important case of a codimension-1 foliation",
    "we need an overall non - vanishing vector field or its dual , an one - form @xmath50 .",
    "this one - form defines a foliation iff it is integrable , i.e.@xmath51 and the leaves are the solutions of the equation @xmath52    now we will discuss an important equivalence relation between foliations , cobordant foliations .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be two closed , oriented @xmath55-manifolds with codimension-@xmath56 foliations .",
    "then these foliated manifolds are said to be _ foliated cobordant _ if there is a compact , oriented @xmath57-manifold with boundary @xmath58 and with a codimension-@xmath56 foliation transverse to the boundary and inducing the given foliation there .",
    "the resulting foliated cobordism classes form a group under disjoint union .      in @xcite ,",
    "thurston constructed a foliation of the 3-sphere @xmath19 depending on a polygon @xmath59 in the hyperbolic plane @xmath60 so that two foliations are non - cobordant if the corresponding polygons have different areas . for later usage",
    ", we will present this construction now ( see also the book @xcite chapter viii for the details ) .",
    "consider the hyperbolic plane @xmath60 and its unit tangent bundle @xmath61 , i.e the tangent bundle @xmath62 where every vector in the fiber has norm @xmath63 .",

    "now we consider two codimension-1 foliations @xmath90 depending on the convex polygons @xmath91 and @xmath92 in @xmath60 .",

    "this section is two - fold .",
    "on one side we will try to construct the states in the factor @xmath2 algebra by geometric methods .",
    "but on the other side we will also discuss the operators interpreted as cobordisms between the states ( in the sense of the topological qft a la atiyah ) .",
    "this section is different from the others , we present only the ideas and leave the proofs for further papers .      in subsection [ sub : the - observable - algebra ] we described the observable algebra ( i.e. the poisson algebra ) as the space of flat connections @xmath22 where the observables are the holonomies ( [ eq : holonomy - definition ] ) of the flat connection along closed curves .",
    "this picture remains true after quantization where we obtain the skein algebra . in subsection",
    "[ sub : idempotent - operators - knot - cobordism ] we considered the idempotent operators represented by closed curves .",
    "finally we showed in theorem [ thm : leaf - space - temperley - lieb - algebra ] that these closed curves generate the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "especially the linear combination of two generators is represented by a singular flow ( see fig . [",
    "fig : resolution - sing ] ) .",
    "an observable is represented by a hermitean operator or equivalently by a linear combination of projectors .",
    "therefore an observable is given by a singular flow or by using theorem [ thm : idempotent - operators - as - closed - curves ] as a singular knot ( or link ) .",
    "now we will consider a special idempotent operator known as jones - wenzl idempotent .",
    "for its construction we have to modify the definition ( [ jones - algebra ] ) of the algebra : instead of @xmath587 we write @xmath588 where @xmath273 is a real number given by a closed circle in the polygon @xmath572 .",
    "so , we modify one rule in the definition of our algebra : adding an internal circle is equivalent to a multiplication with @xmath273 .",
    "if @xmath273 is the number @xmath589 with @xmath590 a @xmath591th root of unity ( @xmath592 for @xmath593 ) and @xmath594 a subalgebra generated of @xmath578 missing the identity @xmath595 then there is an element @xmath596 with @xmath597 called the jones - wenzl idempotent @xcite .",
    "this idempotent is used to define a 3-manifold invariant of witten type @xcite .",
    "witten defines this invariant by the state sum of the chern - simons theory ( for a suitable gauge group , here it is @xmath598 ) .",
    "this unexpected relation gives a hint for a possible action related to our qft ( given by the factor @xmath2 ) .      in the previous subsection we considered the observables of the theory given by singular knots or links .",
    "now we are interested in the construction of states in the factor @xmath599algebra @xmath263 , i.e. linear functionals @xmath600 which are positive ( @xmath601 for all @xmath602 ) and normed @xmath603 .",
    "usually one constructs the states by a representation ( gns ) of the algebra @xmath263 into a hilbert space . from the physical point of view , one can argue that every pure state must be corresponding to a classical state .",
    "because of the relation between the poisson algebra @xmath22 and its quantization as skein space @xmath528)$ ] , the state must be the holonomy along a knot . to see this fact",
    ", we will follow another path .",
    "our theory is purely topological , i.e. we assign to every observable ( as endomorphism of some hilbert space ) a singular knot . following the axioms of a topological qft ( tqft ) by atiyah ,",
    "one assigns to a cylinder like @xmath481 $ ] an endomorphism . in our case",
    "it is an element of the skein space , i.e. a singular knot .",
    "singular knots appear in the theory of vassiliev invariants where one considers transitions between two different knots . for our approach",
    "we have to interpret the 3-dimensional objects in the 4-dimensional context .    for that purpose",
    "we consider the horocycle foliation of the unit tangent bundle @xmath244 of a surface @xmath5 with genus @xmath6 . as usual",
    "we associate to this foliation a codimension-1 foliation of the 3-sphere given by a polygon @xmath59 in @xmath60 with @xmath238 vertices ( or sides ) . in the proof of the theorem [ thm : codim-1-foli - radial - fam ] ,",
    "the cobordism class of this foliation ( i.e. the godbillon - vey invariant ) is determined by a capped grope ( with its design ) .",
    "this capped grope is determined by a path in a binary tree ( a trivalent tree ) , see subsection [ sub : design - of - ch ] .",
    "the capped grope is embedded in some 4-space , i.e. the boundary of the capped grope , a circle , is embedded in the 3-space ( @xmath19 or @xmath604 ) .",
    "the caps in the capped grope are also immersed disks ( see subsection [ sub : capped - gropes ] ) .",
    "therefore , by fixing one cap , we have a cobordism between two embedded circles or a cobordism between two knots . especially , this cobordism is induced from a cobordism between the embedding spaces , usually called a knot concordance .",
    "therefore we have identified the endomorphisms as knot concordance between two knots , the states .",
    "there is an extensive literature for the relation between knot concordances and capped gropes @xcite .",
    "especially we mention the relation to vassiliev invariants @xcite and the kontsevich integral @xcite . here",
    "we presented only this relation and refer to our future work .",
    "in this paper we presented a variety of relations between codimension-1 foliations of the 3-sphere @xmath19 and noncommutative algebras . by using the results of our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we obtain a relation between ( small ) exotic smoothness of the @xmath0 and noncommutativity via the noncommutative leaf space of the foliation and the casson handle .",
    "thus we get our main result of this paper : + _ the casson handle carries the structure of a noncommutative space determined by a factor @xmath9 algebra which is related to the skein algebra of the disk with marked points and to the leaf space of the horocycle foliation . _",
    "+ thus we have obtained a direct link between noncommutative spaces and exotic 4-manifolds which can be used to get a direct relation to quantum field theory .",
    "one of the central elements in the algebraic quantum field theory is the tomita - takesaki theory leading to the @xmath2 factor as vacuum sector @xcite . as a possible candidate one has loop quantum gravity with an unique diffeomorphism - invariant vacuum state @xcite .",
    "especially the relation to skein spaces and knot concordances are very attractive for future work .",
    "our work has also some overlap with the nice work @xcite for quantum gravity .",
    "we will close our paper with some speculations for a possible interpretation of the capped gropes as the trees in connes - kreimer renormalization theory .",
    "starting point is the observation , that the hopf algebra of formal vector fields in a codimension-1 foliation is isomorphic to the hopf algebra of renormalization in qft a la kreimer . in our context",
    "it means that exotic smoothness ( as described by codimension-1 foliations ) has many to do with renormalization in qft .",
    "again we refer to our future work .",
    "we consider a tubular neighborhood @xmath406\\subset\\mathbb{r}_{1}^{4}$ ] of @xmath274 and glue the casson handle along some 2-handle .",
    "now we will weaken the casson handles by using capped gropes ( see chapter 1 - 4 in @xcite ) denoted by gch .",
    "these differ from casson handles in that many surface stages are interspersed between the immersed disks of casson s construction .",
    "the gch are also indexed by rooted finitely branching objects .",
    "the growth rate of their stages was determined in @xcite ( theorem a ) to be at least exponential ( more than @xmath605 ) . in the proof of theorem 3.2 in @xcite the gaps in the design where used .",
    "the gaps in case of the casson handle are not manifolds and look like @xmath606 . in case of the capped grope one has `` good '' gaps of the form @xmath387 .",
    "that is the reason why we switch to these objects now .",
    "now we decompose the gap by @xmath607 with the unit interval @xmath608=d^{1}$ ] .",
    "the boundary is a decomposition @xmath609 of the caps ( north and south ) and the equator region ( see fig . [",
    "fig : decomposition - of - gap ] ) .    ]",
    "the radius coordinate @xmath610 defined above is identified with the unit interval of the @xmath611 ( see the proof of theorem 3.2 ) . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "we think of each gap as @xmath612 where @xmath613 is the neighborhood around the north pole of the 2-sphere in fig .",
