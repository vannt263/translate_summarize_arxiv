    "the genealogy of a population describes the relationships between all the ancestors of this population .",
    "simple questions one may ask about the genealogy of a population are :    how far one has to go into the past to find the most recent ancestor of two individuals ? of @xmath0 individuals ? of the whole population ?    how do these times depend on the sample of @xmath0 individuals chosen at random in the population ?    how do they depend on the size of the population ?    how do they fluctuate when the population evolves over many generations ?    how are they affected by the forces ( like selection ) acting on evolution ?    in the case of _ an asexual evolution _ , the ancestry of a population is a tree , the root of which is the most recent common ancestor of the whole population . in the neutral case ( i.e. when all individuals have on average the same number of surviving offspring at the next generation ) , for a well mixed population , the height of the tree is proportional to the size of the population ( see figure [ t1 ] ) and its statistics are described by kingman s coalescent @xcite ( see section 2 ) .     individuals . for the particular realization shown on the figure ,",
    "the number of generations to reach the most recent common ancestor is 125 , which is , as expected , of order @xmath1 .",
    "already for @xmath2 , all the visible nodes are coalescences of pairs of branches and one can not see any multiple coalescences except at the very bottom of the figure where the number of branches is still of order @xmath1 . ]    in a series of recent papers , together with a.h .",
    "mueller and s. munier @xcite , we considered a family of models of evolution with selection .",
    "for these models , in contrast to the neutral case , the height of the tree grows logarithmically with the size of the population and , its shape ( see figure [ t2 ] ) is given asymptotically by the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent @xcite rather than by kingman s coalescent .    . the number of generations ( 10 for the realization of the exponential model shown on the figure ) to reach the most recent common ancestor is much shorter than in the neutral case .",
    "in contrast to the neutral case , one can observe multiple coalescences even rather high in the tree . ]    in the case of _ sexual evolution _",
    ", each individual has two parents , four grand parents , and so on .",
    "each individual is therefore the root of what looks like a tree for the first generations in the past .",
    "going further into the past , however , the branches of this tree start to merge ( see figure [ 2p ] ) and the number of distinct ancestors do not grow exponentially anymore @xcite .",
    "the number of ancestors then saturates at a value which is a fraction of the whole population living in this remote past ( the rest of this past population consists of all those individuals who had no offspring or whose lineage became extinct ) . comparing the ancestry of two individuals of the same generation , one sees two growing binary trees in the recent past which then start to intermix in a more remote past until they become identical .        here",
    "we try to review a few properties of the genealogies of some simple models of evolving populations , both in the neutral case and in the case of selection . in section  2",
    ", we recall a few properties of the kingman coalescent and of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent , as special cases of coalescent processes and why neutral evolution in the asexual case leads to the kingman coalescent , in the limit of a large population . in section  3",
    ", we describe the properties of the exponential model , an exactly soluble of asexual evolution in presence of selection , and show that its trees follow the statistics of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent . in section  4 , we show that , like the exponential model , more generic models of evolution with selection converge to the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the case of sexual evolution both in the neutral case and in presence of selection .",
    "to study the statistical properties of the trees generated by sexual reproduction , one can adopt several points of view :    1 .",
    "one can try to see how the population can be partitioned into @xmath3-families , with the rule that two individuals belong to the same @xmath3-family if and only if their most recent common ancestor is at a distance less than @xmath3 generations in the past .",
    "these @xmath3-families can themselves be divided into subfamilies by choosing a shorter number of generations @xmath4 , and so on .",
    "2 .   one can alternatively study the genealogical tree as a dynamical process and try to determine the rates @xmath5 at which @xmath6 branches merge into one when one moves from the bottom to the top of the tree ( _ i.e. _ when one looks at the tree backwards in time ) .",
    "these rates might be correlated in time or depend on the characteristics of the individuals along the branches which merge .",
    "3 .   in our previous works",
    "@xcite we chose to compute for these random trees the coalescence times @xmath7 defined as follows : @xmath7 is the age of the most recent common ancestor of @xmath8 individuals chosen at random in the population . in general the times",
    "@xmath7 depend both on the sample of @xmath8 individuals chosen and on the generation .",
    "one advantage of characterizing the random trees by the times @xmath7 is that they are relatively easy to average ( over the samples of @xmath8 individuals and over the generations ) in simulations .    for some models , such as coalescence processes discussed below",
    ", one can find explicit mathematical formulae which relate these various properties @xcite .",
    "coalescent processes give a simple procedure to generate a whole class of random trees @xcite . in a continuous time version ,",
    "a coalescent process is a dynamical stochastic process , where any set of @xmath6 individuals have a probability @xmath9 of coalescing into one individual during the infinitesimal time interval @xmath10 , implying that , if the number of branches is @xmath11 at time @xmath12 , the probability @xmath13 of having @xmath14 branches at time @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) is given by @xcite @xmath17    from the rates @xmath5 , one can easily calculate the times @xmath18 ( averaged over all the realizations of the coalescence process ) by analyzing what happens in a steady state situation during an infinitesimal time interval @xmath10 @xmath19 one then gets @xmath20   \\label{t234 } \\\\[-1ex ] \\frac{\\langle t_4 \\rangle } { \\langle t_2 \\rangle } = \\frac{27 q_2 ^ 2 - 56 q_2 q_3 + 28 q_3 ^ 2 + 12 q_2 q_4 - 10 q_3 q_4 } { ( 3 q_2 - 2 q_3 ) ( 6 q_2 - 8 q_3 + 3 q_4 ) } . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath21 determines the time scale of the times @xmath7 and all the ratios @xmath22 are given by ratios of the coalescing rates @xmath5 .    _ remark : _ an alternative way of thinking of the coalescence processes @xcite defined above is to say that during every infinitesimal time interval @xmath10 , there is a probability @xmath23 that a fraction @xmath24 of all the branches coalesces into a single branch , all the other branches remaining unchanged .",
    "then for @xmath6 given individuals , the probability that their @xmath6 branches merge during @xmath10 is given by @xmath25 while the probability @xmath26 that @xmath11 distinct branches becomes @xmath14 branches during the time interval @xmath10 is @xmath27 and one recovers ( [ rb1 ] ) .",
    "two special cases will be of interest in what follows :    1 .   _ the kingman coalescent _   + in the kingman coalescent , only @xmath28 and all the @xmath29 for @xmath30",

    "the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent can be defined by @xmath33 leading to @xmath34    a natural question , then , is to know whether a given model of evolution ( with or without selection ) gives rise to random trees which can be described by a particular coalescent process @xcite .",
    "the wright - fisher model @xcite is one of the simplest and most studied models of evolution in the neutral case . in its simplest version ,",

    ", the parent of each individual is chosen uniformly among the @xmath1 individuals living at the previous generation .",
    "it is easy to see that the probability @xmath5 that @xmath6 individuals have the same parent at the previous generation is @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and large @xmath1 .",
    "moreover the probability of seeing more than one coalescence event among @xmath6 individuals ( with @xmath39 of order @xmath40 ) at a given generation becomes also much smaller than @xmath21 for large @xmath1 .",
    "therefore in the limit of a large population , the time @xmath41 scales like @xmath1@xmath42 the ratios @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and the statistics of the trees are given by the kingman coalescent .",
    "the kingman coalescent is particularly central in the theory of neutral evolution because it is universal @xcite : one can change the rules in the definition of the wright - fisher model in many ways and in the limit of a large population , one always recovers the kingman coalescent . for example one may choose the parent  @xmath45 in the previous generation with a non uniform probability @xmath46 and as long as these @xmath46 decay fast enough with the size @xmath1 of the population , one has in the large @xmath1 limit @xmath47 for @xmath44 and one recovers the kingman coalescent @xcite .",

    "the correlations between these times at different generations can be computed @xcite .",
    "these fluctuating shapes of the trees are very reminiscent of the tree structure of pure states predicted by the mean field theory of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "+   + _ remark 3 : _ one can define a finite dimensional version of the wright - fisher model by considering that the individuals of the population are at the nodes of a lattice of @xmath48 sites with periodic boundary conditions in dimension  @xmath49 and that each individual has its parent chosen at random among all the sites at a distance less than @xmath50 with @xmath51 . @xcite . in dimension @xmath52 , the genealogies of such populations have their statistics still given by the kingman coalesent ( the problem can be formulated as a reaction diffusion probleme whose upper critical dimension is @xmath53 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in dimension  @xmath40 , the statistical properties of the trees are modified ( they can be understood in terms of coalescing random walks ) and ( [ kingman ] ) is then replaced by @xcite @xmath54 note that in this case the spatial aspect is crucial , and there is no choice of the @xmath5 for which the one dimensional problem could be reduced to a coalescent process as defined in section ( [ coal ] ) : for all the coalescent processes , the age @xmath55 of the most recent common ancestor of two individuals has an exponential distribution implying that @xmath56 whereas @xcite , for the finite dimensional model in @xmath57 , this ratio takes the value @xmath58 .",
    "the exponential model @xcite is a simple generalization of the wright - fisher model , which includes the effect of selection . as in the wright - fisher model",
    "the size @xmath1 of the population remains the same at every generation .",
    "all the individuals at a given generation are however not equivalent : each individual @xmath45 at generation @xmath35 carries a value @xmath59 which represents a trait ( or a fitness in the sense used by bak and sneppen @xcite ) .",
    "there are then two steps to go from generation @xmath35 to generation @xmath60 :    _ the reproduction step : _ each individual has its offspring generated by a poisson process of density @xmath61 .",
    "this simply means that , with probability @xmath62 , there is an offspring of @xmath63 in the infinitesimal interval @xmath64 . repeating the procedure for all individuals @xmath45 at generation @xmath35",
    ", one gets that way an infinite number of offspring along the real axis , with many offspring for large negative @xmath65 and no offspring for sufficiently large positive @xmath65 ( note that at the right of any point @xmath65 on the real axis there are always a finite number of offspring ) .    _ the selection step : _ at generation @xmath60 , one keeps only the @xmath1 rightmost points among all these offspring .",
    "+   +     the simplicity of the exponential model comes from the following identity @xmath66 . \\label{xg}\\ ] ] this means that the offspring of all the individuals at generation @xmath35 can be generated by a single poisson process centered at position @xmath67 .",
    "so @xmath67 is the only information about generation @xmath35 needed to generate the next generation .",
    "a simple consequence is that the successive shifts @xmath68 of the position of the population are i.i.d .",
    "another advantage of the exponential model is that the population at generation @xmath35 consists of the @xmath1 rightmost points of a single poisson process ( [ xg ] ) centered at @xmath67 .",
    "one can then show @xcite that the population at generation @xmath60 can be generated in the following way : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and the @xmath1 variables @xmath71 are independent random variables distributed according to @xmath72 d y , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\rm pro b}(y < y_i(g+1 )   < y+ d y ) = \\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{ll } e^{-y } \\",

    "in @xcite , we considered a whole family of models of evolution with selection which generalize the exponential model .",
    "these more generic models are defined as follows : as in the exponential model , the population has a fixed size @xmath1 and each individual @xmath45 at generation @xmath35 is characterized by a real number ( a trait ) @xmath63 . at the next generation , the trait @xmath100 of an offspring @xmath45 is inherited from its parent @xmath101 up to a random number @xmath102 drawn from a fixed distribution @xmath103 which represents the effect of the mutations on the trait @xmath104 @xmath105 then comes the selection step where only @xmath1 survivors among all the offspring produced by generation @xmath60 are chosen according to their trait @xmath100 .    the model @xcite depends on the number of offspring of each individual , on the distribution @xmath103 , and on the way the @xmath1 survivors at generation @xmath60 are chosen among all the offspring of generation @xmath35 .",
    "here we present the result of numerical simulations of three versions of the model , where we always took for @xmath103 a flat distribution :    _ the perfect selection case : _ in this version ( see figure [ perfect - selection ] ) , each individual at generation @xmath35 has two offspring , but out of the @xmath106 resulting individuals we only keep at generation @xmath60 the @xmath1 rightmost ones _",

    "an analysis of the distribution of these rare fluctuations leads to a distribution of @xmath123 , in ( [ fk ] ) , which corresponds to the bolthausen - snitzman coalescent .",
    "so the picture resembles that of the model considered by durrett and schweinsberg @xcite where the effect of selection ends up giving rise to a coalescent with multiple collisions .",
    "it might look paradoxical to get the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent , with multiple branches coalescing at the same point , in situations like the perfect selection case , where each individual has only two offspring . this is simply because coalescences of pairs at nearby generations look like multiple coalescences on a time scale of order @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ fig100outof10000 ] illustrates this mechanism .",
    "we simulated the model with perfect selection for a population of size @xmath124 and , at an arbitrary time , we plotted the coalescing tree of the ancestries of @xmath125 individuals chosen at random . while a close look makes it apparent that there are only coalescences of pairs , one can see several regions where coalescences of pairs occur in quick succession , thus resulting into the quasi - instantaneous coalescence of more than two lines @xcite .     in the model with `` perfect selection '' .",

    "for example if one tries to compare the genealogies of @xmath6 individuals and calls @xmath159 the total number of distinct ancestors of at least one of these @xmath6 individuals at generation  @xmath35 in the past , it is clear that up to a change of initial condition @xmath159 evolves as @xmath128 in  ( [ f - def ] ) : @xmath160 again , as long as @xmath153 , one finds @xmath161 and the ancestors of the @xmath6 individuals are all distinct . on the other hand , all the @xmath162",
    "converge to the same value @xmath163 meaning that all ancestors become common to the whole population .",
    "the number of ancestors @xmath164 common to @xmath53 individuals at generation @xmath35 in the past can be written as @xmath165 more generally the number of ancestors @xmath166 common to @xmath6 individuals at generation @xmath35 @xmath167    for @xmath1 large and @xmath168 , one can expand the solution of ( [ ng ] ) in powers of @xmath136 to get @xmath169 using this expansion in ( [ mg ] ) , one gets that , as long as @xmath170 , @xmath171 by requiring that @xmath172 , one then obtains the number @xmath173 of generations needed to find at least one common ancestor to @xmath6 individuals @xmath174 this expression agrees well with simulations performed by stephane munier @xcite . as the size @xmath6 increases , it converges to chang s expression ( [ g1 ] ) .    for @xmath175 , the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) can be rewritten to leading order as a scaling function @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the solution of @xmath178 \\label{hf}\\ ] ] which starts at @xmath179 as @xmath180 and where @xmath181 is given in  ( [ f - def ] ) . for large @xmath85 , one can see from ( [ hf ] ) that @xmath182 , the attractive fixed point of the map @xmath155 , and linearizing the map ( [ f - def ] ) around this fixed point one gets that for large @xmath85    @xmath183    and where @xmath184 is a periodic function @xmath185 of period 1 .    to find the number of generations @xmath186 for a group of @xmath6 individuals to have all their ancestors in common , one should write that @xmath187 . here ,",
    "as we use deterministic equations , the difference @xmath188 tends exponentially to zero without ever reaching it , so we replace this condition by @xmath189 arguing that the stochastic nature of the evolution of @xmath159 and @xmath166 should make this difference vanish quickly after it has become of order @xmath40 . from ( [ ngh],[h - asympt ] ) , @xmath190 , \\label{ngb}\\ ] ] and one then gets ( [ mg ] ) for @xmath166 @xmath191 . \\label{mgb}\\ ] ] then , as the function @xmath184 is periodic , the coefficient to @xmath192 remains bounded in ( [ ngb],[mgb ] ) as @xmath1 becomes large and one gets that @xmath188 is @xmath193 times a number of order  1 .",
    "therefore , one gets for @xmath186 : @xmath194 \\ln n. \\label{gk - tilde}\\ ] ] we see that for large @xmath1 , the times @xmath195 do not depend on @xmath6 to leading order in @xmath1 and that the expression agrees with chang s prediction ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "one can imagine various ways of introducing selection in a model with sexual reproduction . in an attempt to do so",
    ", we consider the same model as in the neutral case : a population of fixed size @xmath1 , each individual having its two parents chosen at random in the previous generation .",
    "then we introduce selection by saying that each parent @xmath45 is chosen with a probability @xmath196 .",
    "we assume that these @xmath46 are all of order @xmath136 , that their distribution remains the same at all generations , and that there is no correlation between the @xmath46 of an individual and the @xmath46 s of its parents ( the selective advantage is not inheritable ) .",
    "all the analysis of the neutral case can be extended to this case , the only change being that the function @xmath150 defined in ( [ f - def ] ) becomes @xmath197 as the function @xmath181 is modified , all the properties which depend on the precise shape of @xmath181 , such as the fixed point @xmath198 , are modified .",
    "in particular ( [ g2],[gk - tilde ] ) become @xmath199 \\ln n,\\ ] ] while the times @xmath173 to find at least one common ancestor remain unchanged ( [ gk ] ) .    for a particular choice of the @xmath46 where @xmath200 for @xmath201 and @xmath202/n for @xmath203 we show the @xmath204 dependence of @xmath205 on figure [ rs ] .",
    "we see that the time for the whole population to have all their ancetors in common is modified by selection and that , at least for the particular distribution considered here , selection has the effect of increasing the time @xmath206 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as it goes in opposite direction of what we saw in the case of asexual evolution where the effect of selection was to shorten the coalescence times .     for the whole population to have all their ancestors in common versus @xmath204 when the @xmath46 take two values : ( @xmath207 with probability @xmath208 and @xmath209 with probability @xmath204 .",
    "we see that the effect of selection ( here having two possible values of the @xmath46 is to increase the time @xmath132 while in the limit @xmath210 or @xmath211 one recovers chang s value ( [ g2 ] ) . ]",
    "here we have reviewed a series of recent results on simple models of evolution with and without selection .    in the case of asexual evolution , at least for the models we considered here in sections 3 and 4 , the effect of selection is to make the coalescence times @xmath7 ( = the age of the most recent common ancestor to @xmath8 individuals ) grow logarithmically ( [ t2-expo],[ln3 ] ) with the size of the population in contrast to the linear growth of the ( neutral ) wright - fisher model ( section  2.2 ) .",
    "moreover the statistics of the genealogies are modified by selection and seem to be always given by the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent  ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "apart for the exponential model , for which a full mathematical treatment is possible ( see section 3 and @xcite ) , a detailed theory , showing that the generic models of section  4 lead also to the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent , is still missing .",
    "recent mathematical works , however , where selection is replaced by an absorbing wall moving at a constant velocity @xcite or with a more complicated dynamics @xcite to keep the size of the population bounded have shown that the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent does give the tree statistics one should see for this whole class of models .",
    "when looking at the @xmath1 values @xmath63 as a cloud of points moving along the fitness axis , all the models in section 4 lead to a motion of this cloud of points very related to the motion of travelling waves of the noisy fisher - kpp equation",
    ". in fact the same phenomenological theory @xcite which allows one to unsderstand the fluctuations of the position of these travelling waves can be used for the models of section  4 and leads to the bolthausen - sznitman statistics of the genealogies of these models .",
    "other models of evolution with selection on a smooth fitness landscape have been studied in the past @xcite . in these models",
    "each individual has an average number of offspring proportional to the exponential of its fitness ( very much like in the exponential model of section [ expo - mod ] ) giving a huge advantage to the leaders .",
    "obviously , an interesting open question would be to investigate their genealogies in order to see whether these other models lead to new statistics or if they belong to the bolthausen - sznitman universality class .",
    "whether other ways of introducing selection ( rugged landscapes @xcite , competition between a few alleles @xcite ) could lead to a few number of other universality classes is also an interesting question to investigate .    in the sexual case",
    ", we have recalled the main results due to chang @xcite , on the numbers of generations needed to find at least one common ancestor or all common ancestors to the whole population in the neutral case . in an attempt to include selection ,",
    "we have seen how these times are modified , with the rather counter - intuitive result that selection might increase the number of generations to have all ancestors common to the whole population ( in contrast to what happens in the asexual case where this time decreases due to selection ) .",
    "of course a more exhaustive study of the effect of selection on the genealogies , in the case of sexual reproduction , would be suitable in particular when one includes recombination @xcite .",
