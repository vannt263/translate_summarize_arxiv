    "finding an analytic solution to confinement and the mass spectrum of four dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills gauge theories continues to be a challenge for theoretical physics .",
    "it is in the large-@xmath3 limit @xcite that the relation between gauge field theories and string theory is most natural @xcite , and this relation is strengthened by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "indeed a solution to the problem of confinement may shed light on string theories with moderately strong coupling .    in lower dimensions ,",
    "gauge theories are of interest for the same theoretical reasons . in @xmath7",
    "all dynamical degrees of freedom can be removed by gauge fixing , and the theory can be analytically solved , with linear confinement arising trivially from the coulomb potential . moving up one dimension to @xmath8 , makes the theory much more complicated .",
    "gluons become dynamical , a linearly confining potential appears to be dynamically generated , and the theory appears to be as analytically intractable as in the four dimensional case .",
    "this is unfortunate since the @xmath8 theory is also phenomenologically interesting : through dimensional reduction , it approximates the high temperature limit of the four - dimensional theory .",
    "indeed , an analytic solution in @xmath8 dimensions would be a significant step forward , and would perhaps bring us closer to a solution of the @xmath9 case .    while an exact solution to @xmath8 gauge theories is not available , karabali and nair have claimed to obtain a very good approximation through studying the continuum hamiltonian , and expressing it in terms of color - singlet fields @xcite .",
    "truncating the schrdinger equation for their ground state functional , they obtained the following prediction for the tension @xmath10 of the string that binds distant static sources in the fundamental representation : @xmath11 remarkably , this prediction turns out to be within @xmath12 of the lattice calculated values @xcite for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "if one replaces these sources with ones in a general representation , @xmath13 , then the analysis of @xcite predicts that the tension @xmath14 of the string between these sources , obeys @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath13 .",
    "in there are no restrictions on @xmath13 , and so this clearly can not be exact in general : in @xmath8 gluons screen color charge and will , for example , break the string if @xmath13 has trivial @xmath3-ality .",
    "however in the limit @xmath17 screening vanishes and , moreover , the lattice calculations @xcite show a decreasing discrepancy with as @xmath3 increases .",
    "indeed the extrapolated @xmath18 lattice value is only about @xmath19 below the prediction of . at this level of accuracy",
    "there are a number of systematic errors that were inadequately controlled in these lattice calculations , and so this leaves open the tantalising possibility that the calculation of @xcite might become exact at @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide a lattice calculation in which all the systematic errors are controlled at a level that allows us to test this possibility .",
    "one of these systematic errors has to do with corrections to the string energy as a function of length .",
    "this is an interesting theoretical subject of its own , having to do with the nature of the effective string theory that describes the confining flux tube .",
    "we expand in detail on this issue in a companion publication @xcite and here will only quote a few relevant results .",
    "a related issue is how the string tension varies as a function of the representation of the flux .",
    "we extend a similar control of systematic errors to these calculations in a second companion paper @xcite where we test how well the casimir scaling in is satisfied  in particular by stable @xmath20-strings .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic lattice setup .",
    "we then describe the methodology used in the calculation of the string tension , what are the important systematic errors , and how we control them .",
    "we then provide our results , extrapolate them to the continuum limit , and then extrapolate to @xmath4 .",
    "we finish with our conclusions .",
    "some of our preliminary results , both from this paper and from @xcite , have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the theory is defined on a discretized periodic euclidean three dimensional space - time lattice , with spacing @xmath21 and , typically , with @xmath22 sites .",
    "the euclidean path integral is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dimensionless lattice coupling , and is related to the dimensionful coupling @xmath25 by @xmath26 in the large@xmath3 limit , the t hooft coupling @xmath27 is kept fixed , and so we must scale @xmath28 in order to keep the lattice spacing fixed ( up to @xmath29 corrections ) .",
    "the action we choose to use is the standard wilson action @xmath30 , \\label{eq : sw}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a lattice plaquette index , and @xmath32 is the plaquette variable obtained by multiplying link variables along the circumference of a fundamental plaquette .",
    "we calculate observables by performing monte - carlo simulation of , in which we use a mixture of kennedy - pendelton heat bath and over - relaxation steps for all the @xmath33 subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "to obtain the string tension , @xmath10 , we calculate the energy of the lightest flux tube that winds around one of the spatial tori . extracting the mass from the correlation function",
    "is the first area in which we need to control systematic errors , as described below .    in the confining phase such a winding flux tube can not break . since there are no sources here ( in contrast to wilson loop calculations of the static potential ) there are no extraneous contributions to the energy ( such as the coulomb potential ) and one can hope to obtain a string description for all lengths @xmath34 of the flux tube .",
    "there is of course a smallest possible length @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the deconfining temperature , below which there are no winding flux tubes .",
    "however for @xmath37 the transition is first order @xcite and so for larger @xmath3 we can hope to have a string description for any @xmath38 .",
    "such a description should become particularly simple at @xmath4 where mixing and decay vanish .",
    "we have performed a careful study of the way the string energy depends on its length , which will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we use those results to bound the theoretical uncertainties in extracting the asymptotic string tension from the string energy , so controlling the associated systematic errors .",
    "there are also systematic errors in extrapolating to the continuum @xmath39 limit and , subsequently , to the @xmath4 limit .",
    "these will be discussed below as well .",
    "we calculate the energy of the winding flux tube from the correlator of suitably smeared @xmath40 polyakov loops that wind around a spatial torus .",
    "this is a standard technique @xcite with the smearing / blocking designed to enhance the projection of our operators onto the ground states .",
    "( we use a scheme that is the obvious dimensional reduction of the one in @xcite . )",
    "we calculate with several blocking levels and construct the full correlation matrix . from this",
    "we obtain best estimates for the ground and excited string states using a variational method applied to the transfer matrix @xmath41  again a standard technique @xcite .    in practice",
    ", our best operator for the string ground state has an overlap @xmath42 onto that state so that the normalised ` ground state ' correlation function satisfies @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the ground and first excited state string energies .",
    "( since our time - torus is finite , we use cosh fits rather than simple exponentials , although in practice we use @xmath45 large enough for any contributions around the ` back ' of the torus to be negligible . ) to extract @xmath46 from this correlator one can fit with a single exponential for @xmath47 , discarding the lower @xmath48 values so that a statistically acceptable fit is obtained . this is a reasonable approach and one followed in @xcite .",
    "however it neglects the systematic error arising from the fact that there is certainly some excited state contribution as demonstrated , for example , by the fact that one can not obtain a good fit with a single exponential from @xmath49 . to control this systematic error",
    "we also perform fits with two exponentials , with a fixed mass @xmath50 for the excited state , resulting in a mass @xmath51 for the ground state .",
    "typically @xmath51 is smallest when @xmath50 is as small as possible , i.e. @xmath52 , and is largest when @xmath53 , i.e. effectively a single - exponential fit .",
    "so the true value typically satisfies : @xmath54 from here on , we refer to the single - cosh fitting procedure by ` s ' , and to the double - cosh fitting procedure , by ` d ' , and add these as superscripts to any relevant results ( such as masses , string tensions , etc . ) .",
    "consequently we shall have two continuum string tensions @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , that bracket the true string tension @xmath57      from the ground state string energy , @xmath58 , we need to extract the tension @xmath10 . taking into account the lscher term @xcite ,",
    "@xmath10 is given by @xmath59 in practice using @xmath60 one can expect the neglected @xmath61 corrections to be small . however they represent another systematic error that needs to be controlled .",
    "to do this we shall use the results of our study in @xcite , where we have calculated @xmath58 as a function of @xmath34 for @xmath62 .",
    "we have done so in the range @xmath63 and for different lattice spacings .",
    "we find that our results can be well encompassed by @xmath64 here the first two terms on the right hand side constitute the exact nambu - goto string prediction .",
    "it is believed that when one expands @xmath65 in inverse powers of @xmath66 the first two corrections are universal @xcite and equal to those for the nambu - goto string .",
    "( this is consistent with our numerical calculations in @xcite . )",
    "the next possible correction term corresponds to the last term on the right of .",
    "we observe that the fitted coefficient is much smaller than the @xmath67 coefficient characteristic of the other terms .",
    "this shows that nambu - goto provides a remarkably accurate description of the ground state winding string energy for all possible lengths .",
    "the calculations of @xmath58 in this paper are performed for @xmath68 .",
    "we extract the corresponding values of @xmath10 using .",
    "for such @xmath34 the contribution of the correction terms that are additional to the lscher correction is in fact almost negligible , as was assumed in earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "however now we are able to control the accuracy of that assumption .      to extrapolate to the continuum limit we need to choose a theoretically motivated fitting ansatz for the way @xmath69",
    "depends on the bare lattice coupling @xmath24 . from",
    "it is clear that @xmath70 the leading perturbative correction to this relation will be @xmath71 .",
    "( note that we do not have here a ratio of physical quantities for which the leading correction would be @xmath72 . )",
    "lattice perturbation theory is notoriously ill - behaved and to reduce the higher order corrections we replace @xmath24 by the mean - field improved coupling @xcite @xmath73 as in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the continuum extrapolation was performed with a leading @xmath74 correction .",
    "the values of @xmath69 from the coarser values of @xmath21 typically did not lie on the fit , and were excluded .",
    "although this is a sensible procedure , it ignores the ( small ) systematic error due to the neglect of higher order corrections in @xmath75 . here",
    "we will control this error by fitting with an additional correction @xmath76 by comparing these fits with linear fits where we constrain @xmath77 , we shall have an estimate of the effect of higher order corrections . clearly such a strategy is only possible where the calculations are of sufficient range and accuracy , as in the present paper .",
    "it is important to note that this procedure is not without its ambiguities .",
    "the expansion in is a weak coupling one which is functionally incorrect in the strong coupling region .",
    "if our fit includes one or more points in the strong coupling region , it is these points that may well determine our estimate of the coefficient @xmath78 in , in which case the estimate will be unrelated to its actual value .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the fact that unlike the case in @xmath9 ( for @xmath79 ) , the separation between strong and weak coupling does not involve a clear - cut first order transition , but rather a cross - over that turns into a smooth phase transition at @xmath4 @xcite , very much like the gross - witten transition in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this crossover peak increases with @xmath3 and lies in the range @xmath80 @xcite , and so in our fits we shall avoid using any values obtained on the strong coupling side of this peak .",
    "the continuum value of @xmath81 is expected to have a finite limit , with leading corrections of @xmath29 .",
    "hence linear fits in @xmath82 can be used to extrapolate to @xmath4 , as in @xcite . to control the neglected higher order corrections to the linear fit",
    "we shall also perform fits using the more general form @xmath83 and compare the results to those of linear fits ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "there is no reason to believe that this expansion becomes functionally incorrect at small @xmath3 , and we shall use it all the way down to @xmath85 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we plot the values of @xmath86 , as obtained from both @xmath87 and @xmath88 fits , versus @xmath89 for our su(4 ) and su(6 ) calculations .",
    "we display fits that are quadratic , as in .",
    "the @xmath90 correction is always positive , except possibly for su(2 ) , so the quadratic fit leads to a significantly higher value than the linear one in the continuum limit . despite this fact , we see from the figure that the extrapolated string tensions are still lower than the values predicted by karabali , kim , and nair in .     as a function of the improved inverse coupling coupling @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "the error bars at @xmath93 denote the result of the continuum extrapolation , while the horizontal bars denote the values predicted by karabali , kim , and nair @xcite.,width=529 ]    we give the results of our continuum fits in tables  [ table2]-[table3 ] , where we also list for comparison the karabali - kim - nair predictions .",
    "since we are interested in the accuracy of the karabai - kim - nair ( kkn ) prediction with increasing @xmath3 , we define the ratio @xmath94 of that prediction to our lattice values @xmath95 we now fit @xmath96 with the form @xmath97 and present the results for linear fits ( with @xmath98 ) and quadratic fits ( with @xmath99 as a free parameter ) in table  [ table4 ] below .",
    "( the number of degrees of freedom for all fits was @xmath100 . ) finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the ratio @xmath94 plotted against @xmath82 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 linear fits .",
    "as for the continuum extrapolation , the effect of the higher order correction is to lift the @xmath4 value towards the karabali - nair value , albeit not quite far enough to achieve a perfect match .     between the prediction of and our data , as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "the error bar at @xmath101 denotes the linear extrapolation to the @xmath4 limit.,width=529 ]",
    "we have calculated the tensions of strings in the fundamental representation of @xmath0 gauge theories in @xmath1 dimensions . our immediate goal was to test the prediction of karabali - nair in , particularly at @xmath4 , where the screening effects that are clearly not incorporated in that scheme , vanish .",
    "since earlier lattice calculations had already shown that any discrepancy was no more than a few percent , our calculation needed to control a number of previously neglected systematic errors that are small but could be significant at the @xmath19 level .",
    "in this paper we described how we controlled the following errors .",
    "firstly the contribution of excited states to our variationally selected ground state correlators , from which we extract the energy of the ground state winding flux loop .",
    "secondly higher order string corrections in the relationship between this ground state energy and the asymptotic string tension .",
    "( using the results of our companion publication @xcite on the effective string theory describing winding flux loops . )",
    "thirdly , higher order corrections in the continuum extrapolation , and fourthly , higher order corrections in the extrapolation in @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "our final results are similar to the ones of the older work @xcite which assumed that the systematic errors that we control here , are negligible .",
    "we find that this assumption is , as it happens , essentially correct .",
    "our string tensions are @xmath102 smaller than the prediction of , and a discrepancy persists at @xmath4 , where our result is @xmath103 here the first error is statistical , and the second comes from the difference @xmath104 .",
    "this error can only lower the string tension , away from .",
    "consequently , our result is lower by @xmath105 than @xmath106 this difference while small is statistically significant at a compelling @xmath107 sigma level ( depending on the details of the fit ) .",
    "while it is clear that the leading term in the scheme of @xcite is not exact at @xmath4 , our results show that it is astonishingly accurate .",
