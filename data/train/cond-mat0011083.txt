    "the depinning transition of a dislocation moving in a glide plane has been investigated in the past in several papers using a line tension approximation for the dislocation self - interaction and considering interactions with point obstacles @xcite .",
    "in fact , however , the bending of a dislocation line produces a long - range self - stress @xcite and the obstacles responsible for the pinning are often forest dislocations rather than point defects ( i.e. solute atoms , small clusters ) .",
    "this distinction is important since dislocations , in addition to short - range interactions , give rise to long - range stresses in the glide plane and thereby cause a long - range correlated pinning field . also the short - range interactions ( junction formation ) with forest dislocations which in real crystals contribute substantially to the pinning should not be modeled in terms of point obstacles , since the corresponding pinning forces exhibit spatial correlations with ranges of the order of the junction length , which is in turn of the same order as the obstacle ( forest dislocation ) spacing @xcite .    since",
    "long - range interactions are known to affect the general scaling properties of the depinning transition @xcite , in this paper we study dislocation depinning considering explicitly the effects of nonlocal elasticity and spatial correlations in the pinning field . to this end",
    ", we introduce a lattice model with long - range dislocation self - interactions that correctly recovers previous results for the bending of a dislocation segment . using this model",
    "we show that the geometrical properties of the dislocation at depinning differ from those expected in line tension models , as shown by a different roughness exponent .",
    "we consider a dislocation gliding in the @xmath0 plane , parametrized by @xmath1 , with burgers vector @xmath2 , and interacting with a pinning field created by a random array of immobile dislocations threading through the plane .",
    "the resolved shear stress acting locally on the dislocation is given by the sum of three contributions _ xz ( ) = _ xz^ext+_xz^s ( ) + _ xz^p ( ) , where @xmath3 is the externally applied stress and @xmath4 is the pinning field .",
    "we assume that electron and phonon drag lead to an overdamped motion of the dislocation , so that the velocity normal to the dislocation is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an effective viscosity coefficient .",
    "using relations given by hirth and lothe @xcite for the stress fields of dislocation segments , the self - stress of the dislocation can be written as_xz^s()= ds . where @xmath7 is the shear modulus and @xmath8 is poisson s number .    to study the influence of long - range correlations in the pinning stress , we consider a stress field created by an array of immobile dislocations threading through the glide plane .",
    "we note that it is not feasible to consider a fully random arrangment of the threading dislocations , as this would imply a diverging energy density of the pinning field @xcite .",
    "hence some correlations in the dislocation arrangement creating the pinning stress must be assumed to ensure a finite energy density . to this end",
    "we use wilkens construction of a restrictedly random distribution of dislocations @xcite where the system is divided in boxes of side @xmath9 , each of them containing @xmath10 dislocations with a fixed distribution of burgers vectors placed at random within the box . for this model , it is possible to compute analytically the statistical properties of the pinning field . in particular , the stress distribution is symmetric with tails decaying as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the density of dislocations creating the pinning field@xcite . the spatial correlation function of the pinning field",
    "can also be computed @xcite .",
    "this function is given by _",
    "xz^p())_xz^p()= c(b)^2f([-]/_s ) , where the constant @xmath13 depends on the distribution of burgers vectors and @xmath14 with @xmath15 is the correlation length of the pinning field .",
    "the correlation function @xmath16 has the following properties : @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the logarithmic singularity of @xmath21 at the origin is truncated at the dislocation core radius @xmath22 , yielding a mean square stress @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the spatial average of the pinning stress is , of course , zero .",
    "these results have been verified numerically .",
    "we consider a dislocation with average screw orientation ( i.e. , the average line direction is parallel to the @xmath24 axis ) . in a first step",
    ", we perform a simplified analysis and assume that the dislocation has no overhangs ( i.e @xmath25 ) , and only small deformations ( i.e. @xmath26 ) . in this case , the equation of motion becomes=_xz^ext+ ( ( h(x)-h(x))+ ) + _ xz^p(x , h ) .",
    "[ eq : h ] eq . [ eq : h ] describes an elastic interface moving in a quenched disordered medium . for this class of systems",
    "we expect a depinning transition as a function of the external stress .",
    "the average velocity of the dislocation vanishes in the long time limit when the external stress @xmath27 is below a critical value @xmath28 , and scales as @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the critical point may be identified with the yield stress .",
    "we can obtain the dependence of the critical stress on the density of the dislocations creating the pinning field by rescaling eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) . if we define @xmath31 x$ ] , @xmath32 t$ ] and @xmath33 $ ] , the resulting equation depends only on @xmath8 , @xmath34 $ ] and the rescaled external stress , so that _ c = b  _ c(,[m ] ) , where @xmath35 is the depinning stress for the rescaled equation . when pinning is due to the cumulative effect of a large number of obstacles ( weak pinning ) , this stress can be estimated using an argument which is originally due to larkin @xcite . on small scales and for weak",
    "pinning , the self - interaction keeps the dislocation essentially straight .",
    "hence the average force experienced by a segment of length @xmath36 is @xmath37 . above a critical length @xmath38",
    "the dislocation can bow and adjust to the contours of the pinning field . bowing a near - screw segment of length @xmath36 over a characteristic distance",
    "@xmath39 requires a characteristic force @xmath40 $ ] . equating this to the pinning force",
    ", one obtains the larkin length @xmath41 \\sqrt{\\xi_{\\rm s}/\\langle ( \\sigma^{\\rm p})^2\\rangle}]^{2/3}$ ]",
    ". the depinning stress can be envisaged as the strength of the pinning field averaged over the larkin length , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "this estimate yields @xmath43^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "close to the depinning transition the dislocation is expected to be rough and satisfy a self - affinity transformation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the roughness exponent . in practice",
    ", we can obtain @xmath45 from the power spectrum of @xmath46 , which scales as @xmath47 .",
    "power counting suggests that the equation for the dislocation dynamics is in the same universality class as an equation in which the self stress is replaced by @xmath48 , which corresponds to a line tension approximation .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that in the latter case the lineshape is superrough with @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "in addition , transverse motion can lead to a fractal lineshape for strong disorder @xcite .",
    "in order to test the analytical considerations we use a lattice model which allows for transverse motion of dislocation segments in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "we discretize the system into a grid of square cells with boundaries parallel to the @xmath24 and @xmath50 axes and we assign a `` spin '' @xmath51 to the slipped region and @xmath52 to the unslipped region .",
    "the dislocation is defined as the interface between slipped and unslipped region . by definition",
    ", this implies that it is discretized in terms of screw and edge segments .",
    "the stress on a given dislocation segment is computed by summing up the external stress , the pinning stress and the stress due to the other segments which is given by _",
    "xz^s(i)=_j^(s)_s(_i-_j ) + _ j^(e)_e(_i-_j ) where @xmath53 is the point of gravity of the @xmath54th segment , the first sum is over the screw segments and the second over the edge ones , @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 are the stress fields due to screw and edge segments in the origin and the signs @xmath57 , @xmath58 depend on the orientation of the segments .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath24 direction by performing the ewald sum . in order to avoid possible problems with the interaction of near segments @xcite",
    ", we identify the segment length with the dislocation core radius and neglect the self - energy of the segments .",
    "the dynamic evolution is performed by chosing at random one segment and moving it one step by flipping one spin in the direction of the local force . at each time",
    "step the stresses are updated . in order to test the effects of the random update and of the discretization of the dislocation , we considered the bowing of a dislocation line pinned between two points ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this configuration has been investigated in a numerical study by foreman @xcite . in spite of the severe simplifications we make , the critical stresses and critical configurations are in good agreement with results of that work .",
    "we simulate the lattice models using square lattices of size up to @xmath59 . for the pinning field ,",
    "we use again a random stress field created from a wilkens construction performed by placing two screw dislocations of opposite sign and line direction normal to the glide plane at random in a box of size @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in the simulation",
    "reported here we further assume @xmath62 and measure stresses in units of @xmath7 and distances in units of @xmath63 . for the dislocation density creating the pinning field",
    ", we use the value @xmath64 .",
    "we obtain @xmath65 by studying the survival probability @xmath66 @xcite for small lattice sizes @xmath67 . in the limit @xmath68 one",
    "expects @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the heaviside function . for finite @xmath36",
    ", we impose that @xmath65 lies in the region for which @xmath71 and obtain @xmath72 for @xmath64 ( see fig .  2 ) .    for comparison",
    ", we note that the larkin estimate yields @xmath73 .",
    "this value is consistent with the simulation result , although the larkin length @xmath38 is not large as compared to the correlation length @xmath74 as required by the `` weak pinning '' assumption .    simulating the model for larger system sizes",
    ", we see that the dislocation roughens in time but overhangs and islands are not observed ( i.e. the lineshape is not fractal , see fig .",
    "3 ) . we next compute the power spectrum of @xmath46 at @xmath65 for a system of size @xmath75 , averaging over ten realizations of the disorder , and find @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "this result differs from the value @xmath77 obtained using a line tension approximation @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the depinning of a dislocation moving in a fixed glide plane and interacting with a random field that has long - range correlations . for creating the pinning field ,",
    "we have used a wilkens construction with an array of immobile forest dislocations threading normally through the glide plane . it is emphasized that this is _ not _ considered to be a realistic treatment of the interaction between moving and forest dislocations  we have neglected junction formation , while the burgers vector and line direction of the pinning dislocations have been chosen in such a manner as to yield maximum stresses in the glide plane of the moving dislocation .",
    "rather , it was our aim to create a pinning field which ( i ) has correlations with a range of about half the spacing of the pinning dislocations and ( ii ) a pinning strength which corresponds approximately to the strength of a random forest .",
    "( for the present parameters and using relations given in @xcite , this amounts to @xmath78 . ) in this sense the present treatment is supposed to yield a more realistic picture of the depinning of a dislocation interacting with a dislocation forest than previous models assuming point obstacles @xcite .    as a result",
    ", we find that the use of a point obstacle field in conjunction with a line tension approximation tends to overestimate the roughness of the dislocation at the depinning transition .",
    "long range self - interactions give rise to a roughness exponent which is smaller than the value obtained from a simple line tension approximation .",
    "the lineshape of a dislocation depinning from a dislocation forest is of significant importance for theories of work hardening and microstructure evolution .",
    "fractal lineshapes of depinning dislocations may help to explain the observation of fractal dislocation patterns @xcite , and the fact that a moving fractal dislocation must leave behind loops has been invoked as a reason for work hardening @xcite . while the present results do not support this viewpoint , further studies are required to analyze possible crossovers to fractal dislocation lineshapes in stronger pinning fields .",
