    "supernova ( sn ) 2006jc is the prototype of the class of hydrogen - deficient sne that exhibit prominent narrow lines of he  i in their spectra , the so - called  type ibn \" sne @xcite . sn  2006jc also has the distinction of being the first sn for which a pre - explosion outburst was detected ; in the case of sn  2006jc an outburst was previously identified at the sn position in 2004 , hence 2 years prior to the sn itself @xcite .",
    "outbursts of this sort are usually associated with luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) for which eruptions are considered a natural part of their evolution , despite the exact physics responsible for them is poorly known . @xcite first confirmed the presence of a bright , massive ( @xmath7 ) lbv - like progenitor in pre - explosion observations of the type iin sn 2005gl .",
    "lbvs provide a natural connection between pre - explosion outbursts and the creation of dense h - rich circum - stellar envelopes with which subsequent sne interact yielding type iin sne .",
    "in contrast , type ibn sne require the presence of an he - rich and , generally , h - poor circumstellar medium ( csm ) arising from a wolf - rayet ( wr ) progenitor undergoing an lbv - like eruption , although this interpretation has been somewhat questioned with the discovery of a type ibn sn in the outskirts of an elliptical galaxy ( hence in a likely old stellar population environment ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so far , about two dozen type ibn sne have been discovered ( see , e.g. , the samples of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and no other example has shown an lbv - like outburst similar to that observed before the explosion of sn  2006jc .",
    "in addition , no progenitor of a type ibn sn has ever been seen in quiescence to unequivocally prove the wr nature of their progenitors .",
    "for all these reasons , the stellar configuration that produced the sequence of events observed at the location of sn  2006jc is still debated .",
    "the most common interpretation for sn  2006jc and its precursor outburst , is that the progenitor was a wr star with residual lbv - like instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". an alternative scenario , however , was proposed by @xcite for sn  2006jc , invoking a massive binary system to explain the chain of events that occurred in 2004 - 2006 : an lbv companion erupted in 2004 , and while it was a wr star that exploded in 2006 as a normal stripped - envelope sn . nonetheless , this scenario did not comfortably explain the narrow he  i emission features observed in the spectrum of sn  2006jc .",
    "furthermore , if sn  2006jc occurred in a massive star forming region there was the possibility that the precursor outburst may have arisen from an lbv - like star in close proximity to the progenitor but otherwise unrelated to the explosion .    here",

    "more recently an earlier observation of ugc  4904 acquired by k. itagaki on 2006 oct 3 was found , in which sn 2006jc was detected at @xmath11 .",

    "if the light curve decay suddenly flattened at this time , for sn 2006jc to reach the brightness of the source observed in 2010 would require the decline rate to drop dramatically to @xmath56 ( or even lower if the flattening of the lightcurve occurred later ) .",
    "the lack of a detection of sn  2006jc in the 2008 wfpc2 observations suggests that the rate of decline observed at 180d continued at much later epochs .",
    "the last reported three - colour photometry of sn  2006jc in 2007 reported by @xcite , in comparable bands to the 2010 observations , also shows that sn 2006jc becoming redder in the @xmath57 colour compared to the source recovered in 2010 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : res:2col ] ) . some caution , however , is required due to the large uncertainties associated with the later photometry of sn 2006jc and the photometry of the 2010 source . based on the red late - time colour of sn  2006jc and the severe implications for a very sudden flattening of the light curve after @xmath58 we consider it unlikely that the source recovered in the 2010 observations",
    "is sn 2006jc .    the point - like nature of the late - time source ( fwhm @xmath59 pix , corresponding to 15.5 pc at the distance of ugc 4904 ) is evidence against its origin in a light echo arising in an interstellar dust sheet , as it would require a very specific configuration of a sheet of scattering dust located immediately behind sn  2006jc .",
    "observations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite indicated the presence of significant dust formation after @xmath60 , with @xcite measuring @xmath61 mags , arising from dust within @xmath62 of the point of the explosion , 230 days post - explosion .",
    "based on observations at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite also reported the presence of a pre - existing shell of dust extending to @xmath63 around the progenitor of sn  2006jc in which a light echo might arise and which , at its maximum extent , would remain unresolved in these late - time observations . at the time of these observations , however , the light echo would arise _ behind _ sn  2006jc , requiring scattering through angles @xmath64 which is inefficient @xcite .    in addition , the contribution of an optical light echo is expected to produce a sed which is very close to that of the sn at early epochs . to assess the likely colour of a light echo , we considered the colour of sn 2006jc integrated over the entire light curve reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we conservatively assume that the brightness from the time of explosion to the first photometric measurements , which were only acquired after maximum , is constant .",
    "we find the total integrated colour , under these conditions , to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which is consistent with the earliest observed colours of @xmath67 and @xmath68 mags ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bluer than the photometry of the 2010 source ( see fig . [",
    "fig : res:2col ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the observed colour of sn  2006jc and other type ibn sne ( e.g. sn 2010al ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest , however , the sn may have been even bluer prior to the first photometric measurements , implying that our integrated colour is in fact a red limit for the colour of a possible light echo .    as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : res : image ] , sn  2006jc occurred in a relatively sparse area of ugc 4904 . in an area within 1 arcsec of the position of sn  2006jc , we find 10 sources recovered with @xmath69 , including the source at the sn position .",
    "given the density of sources within the 1 arcsec area , we estimate the probability of finding one bright source inside the @xmath27 error radius on the position of sn  2006jc to be 0.01 , implying that it is unlikely to find by chance an unrelated source to be spatially coincident with the sn position .",
    "+ overall , given the brightness , colours and spatial extent of the late - time source derived from the 2010 acs observations , the simplest explanation is that this source is a star and is likely to be associated with sn  2006jc .",
    "future observations with hst will be required to confirm the continued presence of this source if it is indeed a star . on the colour - colour plane ( see fig . [",
    "fig : res:2col ] ) , the position of the late - time source is coincident the supergiant two - colour sequence for limited reddening . assuming a galactic @xmath70 @xcite reddening law and the total extinction measured towards sn 2006jc at early times by @xcite of @xmath71 mag , the corresponding probability density function for the position of the source on the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , in conjunction with cambridge stars models @xcite , is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : res : hrd ] .",
    "if no prior is assumed for the reddening , the colours of the late - time source , assuming a stellar origin , limit the total reddening to @xmath72 mag .",
    "while the filter combination used for the 2010 acs wfc observations can be used to place a constraint on the degree of reddening ( and , therefore , extinction ) , it is not a sensitive diagnostic of stellar temperature at high temperatures .",
    "the range of temperatures and luminosities that can be accommodated by the observed photometry primarily reflects the large range in possible bolometric corrections , rather than being due to uncertainties in reddening . despite the extent of possible locations for this source on the hr diagram",
    ", we note this star is outside of the regions associated with s doradus variables in either quiescence or outburst @xcite",
    ".    if the late - time source is an unresolved cluster , which might have hosted the progenitor of sn  2006jc , we note that absolute magnitude of the source , excluding considerations of extinction , is @xmath73 , which is 3 mags fainter than the suggested brightness at which unresolved clusters may be confused for individual stars @xcite . in comparison with starburst99 models @xcite the colours of the late - time source are consistent with an unresolved cluster for @xmath74 mags .",
    "if sn  2006jc occurred in a host cluster , any extinction that the cluster was subject to would also have affected the sn at early times , which was not observed .",
    "in addition , there is insufficient time for any dust formed in sn 2006jc to be distributed on spatial scales similar to the typical sizes of clusters to extinguish a host cluster by the time of the 2010 observations .",
    "based on the properties of the late - time source we cautiously conclude that the most likely explanation is that it is a star and the companion to the progenitor that exploded as sn  2006jc .",
    "the exact nature of the star is difficult to constrain given the available late - time hst photometry .",
    "the fact that the locus of the star does not correspond exactly with the two locations in which s doradus variables are found on the hr diagram would argue against this star being an lbv , but rather a normal supergiant .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the absence of strong @xmath3 emission at late - times as might be expected of classical lbvs ; however we note that ugc2773 - 2009ot and lmc r71 also do not show strong @xmath3 at late - times afters outbursts and that the limited depth of the late - time @xmath20 observation might not probe weak @xmath75 if it were present .",
    "+ an important question raised by the possible binary nature of the progenitor system of sn  2006jc is which component was responsible for the 2004 precursor outburst .",
    "the late - time hst photometry , at the lowest luminosity limit , is consistent with a @xmath76 a - f supergiant ( see fig . [",
    "fig : res : hrd ] ) , which would make it comparable to properties of the progenitors identified for faint outburst events such as sn 2008s and ngc 300-ot @xcite , but still fainter and less massive than the a - to - f - type hypergiant progenitors of more classical sn impostors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in direct contrast to the former two events , however , there is no evidence that the late - time source at the position of sn  2006jc is enshrouded in significant quantities of dust .",
    "furthermore , apart from the precursor and sn 2006jc , at the sn position , there is no evidence for any significant outburst events after the explosion of the sn .",
    "long term monitoring of the site of sn  2006jc , before and after the 2004 outburst and the 2006 sn explosion , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc : monit ] .",
    "the limited history of outbursts at the location of sn  2006jc would suggest , therefore , that any significant variability ended with the sn . + it is interesting to note that the location of sn  2006jc is offset ( by @xmath77 or a projected distance of @xmath78 ) from the nearest obvious sites containing young massive stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : res : image ] ) .",
    "similar conditions have been observed for the hydrogen - rich interacting type iin sne and some lbvs @xcite ; although @xcite note that classical lbvs are found in close proximity to late - type o stars while non - classical lbvs are found in relative isolation ( this matter was further debated in the exchange between @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of significant @xmath3 emission in the environment of sn  2006jc is also consistent with the observations of @xcite for the positions of interacting sne with respect to hii regions .",
    "this could support the interpretation of the properties of the late - time source as a lower mass star ( @xmath79 ) , that is not associated with recent massive star formation .",
    "the companion would then have to have been sufficiently close to the progenitor to interact with it to induce the outburst ; however , the absence of strong h features from the subsequent sn spectra would require the companion to be sufficiently distant at the time of explosion ( e.g. @xmath80 of h in type iib sne ; although we note that @xcite , @xcite and @xcite report the emergence of weak @xmath81 emission at @xmath8251 days which could be related to the putative companion star ) .",
    "we compared the position of the late - time source on the hr diagram with the locus of binary companions , at the time of the explosion of the primary , predicted by binary population and spectral synthesis ( bpass ) models @xcite , as shown on figure [ fig : res : hrd ] ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the locus for the companions , generally following the main sequence and its turn - off , intersects with the contours for the late - time source at higher masses ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "if the companion was indeed massive , this would favour a high mass wr progenitor .",
    "we caution , however , that this family of models do not predict the progenitor and binary companion for sn  1993j , given the observed constraints on the binary progenitor system determined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a model whereby an outburst can be triggered by the interaction of a main sequence companion star with the extended envelope of an evolved primary , with eccentric orbits making the outbursts more extreme .",
    "@xcite proposes a similar model , however it requires a collision between the two stars to produce an outburst ; which can not be the case for sn  2006jc due to the persistence of the source at the sn position after the explosion .",
    "an interesting consequence of repeated periastron passages noted by @xcite is the removal of h envelope of the primary and the increasing eccentricity of the orbit , with @xcite specifically noting the case of wr 140 .",
    "the dependence of the mass loss history of the primary on the orbital properties of the binary system might also explain the evidence for episodic mass loss in the form of shells of material discernible in early - time spectra of sn 2006jc @xcite .",
    "given the importance of binary interactions in the evolution of massive stars @xcite previous encounters with the companion may also have responsible for the h - poor nature of the progenitor and not just the single observed pre - explosion outburst .",
    "an additional possible progenitor scenario for sn 2006jc is suggested by the successful identification @xcite and confirmation , through disappearance , of the low mass progenitor of the type ib sn iptf 13bvn @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the progenitor of sn  2006jc need not have been a massive star capable of evolving into a wr star or an lbv , but was rather a lower mass star ( @xmath84 ) that was stripped of its h envelope and that then evolved as a helium giant .",
    "the luminosities of such stars would be insufficient to drive strong winds , comparable to higher mass wr stars , but would instead have extended he - rich envelopes @xcite . due to the structural differences between helium giants and massive wr stars , the interaction between a low mass helium giant and a binary companion could be different to that expected for a binary system containing a wr star , and might be more amenable to the production of pre - explosion outbursts and the laying down of a dense csm .",
    "detailed calculations of such a binary configuration are , however , beyond the scope of this paper . as noted above , however , the predicted locus for the low mass binary companion to the progenitor of iptf 13bvn presented by @xcite lies at higher temperatures than we have derived for the source recovered in the 2010 observations .    ultimately , confirmation with future hst observations of the sn location to required to test if the source is still present or if it has disappeared and to identify which of the above scenarios is responsible for the late - time brightness of sn  2006jc .",
