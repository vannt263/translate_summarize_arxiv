    "although most state of the art atom interferometers currently utilise laser cooled atoms , there may be some benefit to using bose - condensed atoms .",
    "bose - condensed atoms provide improved visibility in configurations which require complex manipulation of the motional state , such as high momentum transfer beamsplitters @xcite .",
    "the ultimate limit of the sensitivity of any interferometric device which uses uncorrelated particles in each arm is the standard quantum limit @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total number of detected particles @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in surpassing this limit in atom interferometers via the use of quantum entanglement , with two recent proof of principles experiments demonstrating sub - shotnoise phase sensing @xcite .",
    "these experiments exploit the @xmath4-wave scattering to provide one - axis twisting @xcite to generate spin squeezing in the two atomic modes .",
    "however , both of these experiments use only a small number of atoms ( @xmath5-@xmath6 atoms ) , so the absolute sensitivity of the device is low .",
    "it is unlikely that the number of atoms used in this scheme can be increased significantly , as the phase correlations produced become very sensitive to classical uncertainty in the total number of particles as the total number of particles is increased .",
    "atomic four - wave mixing @xcite has long been considered a possible method of creating entanglement between spatially separated atomic modes @xcite , and the generation and detection of quantum correlations using this process has recently been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "four - wave mixing has an advantage over one - axis twisting schemes as the correlations produced by the interaction are number correlations , and are not as sensitive to the total number of particles .",
    "however , it is so far unclear how best to utilise these correlations for the purpose of atom interferometry .",
    "we consider a setup similar to the recent experiment of pertot _",
    "et al._@xcite . here , collisions between two electronic states allow for collinear four - wave mixing , which can be well represented by a four - mode model .",
    "a simple theory predicts that the two modes with low occupation number display sub - shot noise quantum correlations .",
    "however , in order to increase the sensitivity of our device , we devise an interferometry scheme which utilises _ all _ of the available atoms , such that it is possible to surpass the standard quantum limit while retaining a larger number of atoms .",

    "[ sec2 ] , we will describe our proposed scheme . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we will introduce a simple four - mode model to calculate the level of quantum correlations generated from the four - wave mixing process . in section [ sec4 ] we will introduce a more realistic multi - mode model that allows for effects such as spatial inhomogeneity and multiple order scattering . in section [ sec5 ] we will demonstrate how this system can be used to perform an interferometric phase measurement which surpasses the standard quantum limit , and in section [ sec6 ] we will compare our scheme to one - axis twisting for a large number of particles .",
    "our scheme involves two stages : the _ state preparation _ stage ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : fwm_scheme ] ) ) , and the _ interferometry _ stage .",
    "we begin the state preparation stage with a bec containing approximately @xmath7 @xmath8rb atoms , tightly confined in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 direction , and weakly confined in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the @xmath11 confinement is switched off before the state preparation begins .",
    "all atoms are in the @xmath12 hyperfine state . to induce the four - wave mixing , we couple approximately @xmath13 of the atoms to the @xmath14 hyperfine state via a two - photon raman transition , which also transfers linear momentum @xmath15 to the atoms .",
    "in addition , we use resonant microwave coupling to transfer a small amount of population ( approximately @xmath16 ) between @xmath17 and @xmath18 with no momentum transfer . at this stage , modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 each contain approximately @xmath21 atoms , and modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 each contain approximately @xmath24 atoms , where the notation @xmath25 , and the state @xmath26 indicates a wavepacket traveling with mean momentum @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath4-wave collisions between @xmath19 and @xmath20 atoms will transfer particles from @xmath19 to @xmath28 , and @xmath20 to @xmath22 .",
    "the creation of one @xmath28 atom indicates that a @xmath22 atom has also been created , as well as the removal of one atom each from modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is the source of the quantum correlations .",
    "the @xmath16 seed is optional , as the tight transverse confinement strongly suppresses scattering into other modes .",
    "however , we found that the addition of a small seed improved the multimode dynamics of the system , as will be discussed in section [ sec4 ] . after an amount of time @xmath29 ,",

    "in this section we will introduce a simple four - mode model to calculate the degree of quantum correlations generated from the four - wave mixing process . beginning with a full multimode model describing the system ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the inter- and intra- species scattering length , and @xmath39 is the mass of the atom .",

    "@xmath77 decreases from @xmath78 exponentially with @xmath79 .",
    "however , the population grows exponentially , suggesting that our model is invalid for long times , and a model which takes into account depletion is required .",
    "a more complicated analysis of our system which includes effects such as quantum depletion and kerr - dephasing due to uncertainties in the particle number can be achieved by using a stochastic phase - space method .",
    "specifically , we use the truncated wigner ( tw ) approach @xcite , which we will now describe . the master equation for the system",
    "is found from eq.([4mode_ham ] ) , and then converted into a fokker - plank equation ( fpe ) by using the wigner representation .",
    "this equation can then be converted into a set of stochastic differential equations , which we solve numerically . by averaging over many trajectories with different noises in the initial conditions , expectation values of the quantum field operators can be calculated .",
    "when converting our fpe to stochastic differential equations , we ignore terms with third - order derivatives in the fpe , as these terms do nt have a simple mapping to the stochastic differential equations , and can be assumed to be negligible when the field has high occupation numbers @xcite .",

    "to investigate the validity of the approximations we made in the previous section , we introduce a one - dimensional model to investigate the effect of multi - mode dynamics on the four - wave mixing process . assuming the dynamics in the @xmath10 and @xmath9 dimensions is trivial , we reduce eq.([fullham ] ) to one dimension by integrating over the @xmath10 and @xmath9 dimensions .",

    "after @xmath120 ms , the wavepackets have completely separated , and we measure the number of atoms on either side of a central position @xmath121 . using this measurement , we can define the quantities analogous to the populations of the four modes in the previous section as @xmath122    figure([fig : populations ] ) ( a ) shows the populations in each of these modes as a function of @xmath29 . for early times @xmath123 ( @xmath124 @xmath125s ) ,",
    "the multimode model mimics the simple four - mode model .",
    "this is also the time when the variances ( figure([fig : populations ] ) ( b ) ) begin to deviate from the simple four - mode model and @xmath126 reaches its minimum value @xmath127 , almost a factor of ten away from the minimum predicted from the simple four - mode model .",
    "the discrepancy is due to complications arising from multimode effects .",
    "figure([fig : densities ] ) shows the expectation value of the density of the atomic clouds after separation for @xmath128 ms ( @xmath129 ) and @xmath130 ms ( @xmath131 ) . in ( a )",
    ", the density profile of all wavepackets closely resembles that of the initial state , suggesting that eq.([smode_approx ] ) is a good approximation in this case .",
    "however , ( b ) shows significant deviation from these spatial modes .",
    "one cause of this is that the density is higher in the center of each cloud , so the four - wave mixing occurs at a greater rate there , increasing the depletion .",
    "it is interesting to note that discrepancies begin to arise in all three models at roughly the same point , as the quantum depletion which causes the un - depleted pump model to break down also causes approximation in eq.([smode_approx ] ) to break down , as the depletion alters the shape of the spatial mode .",
    "the 2nd effect is the finite momentum spread of the wavepacket allows for spontaneous scattering to unpopulated momentum modes , which slowly grow .",
    "this is the cause of the ` tails ' leading out from the condensate in figure([fig : densities ] ) ( b ) . without the @xmath16",
    "` seed ' in the lowly occupied modes , we observe a greater degree of this spontaneous scattering .",
    "however , increasing the initial population in the seed modes degrades the degree of quantum correlations . picking the optimum level of initial population in these modes is a trade - off between suppressing spontaneous scattering into unpopulated modes , and degrading the degree of quantum correlations produced .",
    "we did not do a comprehensive search to find the optimum value of this initial population , but found that the model behaved to our satisfaction with a @xmath16 seed .",
    "this effect of spontaneous scattering is not present in a semiclassical model , as spontaneous scattering is forbidden .",

    "@xmath121 was chosen as the point @xmath139 mm , which is roughly halfway between the two wavepackets . ]",
    "the obvious method for using the state generated from the four - wave mixing process to perform phase measurements with sensitivity greater than the standard quantum limit would be to use @xmath28 and @xmath22 as the inputs to an atom interferometer , as these are the modes which display two - mode squeezing . however , there are two drawbacks to this approach .",
    "the first is that each of these modes are only lowly occupied , so although they would display sub - shot noise sensitivity when used in the appropriate way for an interferometric measurement , the absolute sensitivity of the measurement would be low , as the total number of particles is small .",
    "the second draw - back is that these modes are nt spatially overlapping , so a complicated sequence of momentum - shaping pulses would be required in order to construct an atom interferometer out of these two wavepackets . by combining these two lowly occupied modes with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which have a much higher occupation , we may be able to maintain the advantage of the quantum squeezing , while increase the total number of particles , such that the absolute sensitivity is increased .",
    "additionally , @xmath19 and @xmath22 form a spatially overlapping pair , as do @xmath28 and @xmath20 .",
    "we can combine these four modes to make an interferometric measurement in the following way . the interferometry stage is implemented by a sequence of @xmath140 microwave pulses resonant with the @xmath141 transition , which provides local coupling for the spatially overlapping wavepackets .",
    "our scheme is described in figure([fig : pulse_seq ] ) . in total , three coupling pulses are used , with a phase shift on @xmath22 and @xmath142 before each coupling pulse .",
    "phase shifts on the left and right wavepacket need to be controlled independently .",
    "this could be implemented by the ac stark shift from independent focussed optical beams .",
    "the first coupling pulse is used to prepare the state such that it is useful for atom interferometry , with the phase shift before the first pulse chosen such that the populations in @xmath19 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath142 are approximately equal after the first beam splitter . at this stage ,",
    "the quantity @xmath143 is squeezed .",
    "that is , the variance in this quantity is much less than for uncorrelated sources .",
    "the phase shift before the second coupling pulse is again chosen such that the populations remain equal . at this point , @xmath144 is anti - squeezed , and the relative phase will be squeezed .",
    "the physical process of interest causes a phase shift @xmath145 between @xmath19 and @xmath22 , and @xmath146 between @xmath23 and @xmath142 to be accumulated during the free evolution between the 2nd and 3rd coupling pulses .",
    "after the 3rd coupling pulse , the the number of atoms in each mode is measured , and @xmath147 is calculated .     pulse sequence .",

    "these phase shifts may be different , and can be implemented using the ac stark shift from a localised optical beam .",

    "the fringe visibility of the final interferometric measurement is @xmath171 for the four mode model , and @xmath172 for the multimode model .",
    "an alternate scheme for performing atom interferometry with sub - shot noise sensitivity is the previously discussed one - axis twisting scheme @xcite .",
    "this scheme involves splitting the condensate , and allowing the nonlinear interactions to ` shear ' the relative phase of the two modes until the desired level of spin squeezing is reached .",
    "however , at this point , the squeezing is not directly usable , and the quadrature squeezing needs to be rotated by an angle @xmath173 such that there are reduced fluctuations in the relative phase . in order to achieve this , an additional phase shift and a coupling pulse",
    "is applied , in an analogous method as discussed in section [ sec5 ] of this article .",
    "significant anti - squeezing instead of squeezing will be observed if the incorrect phase shift is applied .",
    "this phase shift depends critically on the total number of particles , as the nonlinear effect which causes the phase shearing also causes a relative phase shift between the two modes which depends on the number of particles .",
    "as the number of particles becomes large , a small variation in the total number of particles is sufficient to significantly alter the relative phase of the two modes , and thus rotate the squeezing quadrature such that anti - squeezing is observed .    to compare the performance of the one - axis twisting scheme to our four - wave mixing scheme",
    ", we analysed the one - axis twisting scheme via a two - mode model described in @xcite . to demonstrate sub - shotnoise sensitivity",
    ", one would have to find the optimum value of the phase shift , and then perform many shots of the experiment to build up quantum statistics in the signal .",
    "we set the total number of particles as @xmath174 , and optimising the nonlinear interaction time , coupling pulses , and phase shifts , such that the phase sensitivity of the device was @xmath175 .",
    "we then varied the total number by a small amount , whilst keeping all other parameters ( phase shifts and coupling pulses ) fixed .",
    "we found that by altering the total number of particles by about @xmath16 was enough to decrease the sensitivity to the limit set by shot - noise ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is important to note that this degradation of the signal is not due simply to the fluctuations in the number of atoms directly adding noise to the signal , as the signal ( ie , difference in the number of atoms in each mode ) is insensitive to fluctuations in the total number of atoms .",
    "a small shift in total number causes a big shift to the value of the phase shift required in order to rotate the squeezing to the correct quadrature .",
    "however , when the total number of atoms was small ( @xmath176 ) , as in the recent experiments by @xcite , a small fluctuation in total number causes a relatively small phase shift , and a perturbation in the number of particles of @xmath177 was required in order to decrease the sensitivity to the shot - noise limit .    as the hamiltonian for",
    "the fourwave mixing process does nt rely on asymmetric scattering lengths between the two modes , the process that produces the correlation does not also cause a number dependent phase shift .",
    "we found that altering the initial number by @xmath13 in a simple four - mode calculation , while keeping all other parameters the same as was used in figure([sigvar1 ] ) ( @xmath90 , @xmath29 , @xmath149 , @xmath151 , @xmath146 , @xmath148 , @xmath150 , and @xmath145 ) , the shot - noise limit was still surpassed .",
    "this indicates that four - wave mixing is sufficiently robust against shot - to - shot number fluctuations that it can be used with a large number of particles .",
    "we have demonstrated that quantum correlations generated from four - wave mixing can be utilised to perform atom interferometry with sensitivity greater than the standard quantum limit . over longer timescales ,",
    "multi - mode effects cause complicated evolution in the spatial mode of the wavepackets , which reduce the strength of the useful correlations and ultimately limit the amount of squeezing once can produce . by combining lowly occupied , yet correlated modes with the two remaining highly occupied modes , it is possible to surpass the shot - noise limit , while still using a large number of atoms , increasing the absolute sensitivity of the device .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate a scheme for atom interferometry that surpasses the standard quantum limit . a four - wave mixing scheme similar to the recent experiment performed by pertot _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite is used to generate sub - shot noise correlations between two modes . </S>",
    "<S> these two modes are then interfered with the remaining two modes in such a way as to surpass the standard quantum limit , whilst utilising all of the available atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme can be viewed as using two correlated interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the signal from each interferometer when looked at individually is classical , but there are correlations between the two interferometers that allow for the standard quantum limit to be surpassed . </S>"
