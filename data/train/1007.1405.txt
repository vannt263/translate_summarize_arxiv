    "halo_. one neutron halos , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and two - neutron halos , such as @xmath0 and @xmath4 , are the most common , although there are nuclear states with the halo formed by protons or more than two neutrons .",
    "all these systems have very small separation energies and unusually large matter radii , when compared to neighboring nuclei , and many of their properties are determined by the long - range part of the many - body wavefunction .",
    "halo systems are not specific to nuclear physics ; a review covering a number of fields can be found in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on two - neutron halo nuclei in which long - range coulomb effects are not present .",
    "traditionally , the theory of halo nuclei has been dominated by simple few - body models .",
    "these models place their faith on the fact that the valence particles forming the halo are partially decoupled from the rest of the system , the core . in this frame of mind",
    ", one typically assumes that the core degrees of freedom are completely frozen , while meticulously treating the relative motion between the valence nucleons and the core .",
    "then , the many - body problem containing a two - neutron halo reduces to a core+n+n three - body one . for an overview of three - body techniques applied to halo nuclei , see for example @xcite .",
    "the crucial assumption of few - body models , a macroscopic inert core , is a mixed blessing : on one hand , it allows one to focus on the long - range core - valence correlations , on the other hand , it is undoubtedly a crude simplification of the many - body problem .",
    "stemming from the inert core employed , the main drawbacks of three - body models are : i ) unknown properties of the core , i.e. the internal details of the core are left out completely and , only when needed , they are provided in an ad hoc manner , ii ) the improper treatment of antisymmetrization @xcite , iii ) the use of effective core - nucleon interactions constructed case by case in an ambiguous manner , and iv ) the fact that even when the two - body interactions are fitted to ( some ) properties of all two - body subsystems , the resulting three - body separation energy is ( much ) smaller than the experimental value @xcite . this pathological lack of binding is often cured with an empirical three - body force or the two - body forces are refitted to deliver the right three - body binding . furthermore , there are indications that for reaction calculations three - body wavefunctions may require additional renormalization to account for microscopic effects missing in the inert - core approximation @xcite .",
    "some improvement over the inert - core picture is provided by few - body models incorporating collective excitations into the core @xcite ; they , however , still suffer from the above - mentioned drawbacks of few - body models , and in addition are limited to applications where the core is a good rotor or vibrator .",
    "given all these drawbacks , the predictive power of three - body models of two - neutron halo nuclei is rather limited .",
    "the above - mentioned drawbacks of few - body models are eliminated in microscopic ( cluster ) models of light nuclei . over the last decade",
    ", there have been tremendous advances in brute force ab - initio methods and due to increasing computational power , these models have improved their accuracy and predictability . amongst these ,",
    "the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) @xcite , the no - core shell model @xcite , and molecular dynamics models @xcite have been successfully applied to light s- and p - shell nuclei .",
    "somewhere between few - body and ab - initio models are microscopic cluster models in which some degrees of freedom are frozen to reduce the complexity of the many - body problem .",
    "of particular relevance to this work is the stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite which inspired several aspects of the model here presented .",
    "applications of svm and some other cluster models to two - neutron halo nuclei can be found for example in @xcite .    despite the success of existing microscopic ( cluster ) models applied to non - halo nuclei and their ability to reproduce basic properties of some halo species , such as ( three - body ) binding energies and radii , questions may arise about their ability to capture the long - range halo correlations .",
    "these correlations are important because the halo nucleons spend a considerable amount of time in regions distant from the core and , generally , it is this part of configuration space that contributes the most to reaction observables .",
    "as is known from three - body models , the wavefunction describing a two - neutron halo nucleus ought to fall off exponentially .",
    "existing microscopic structure models do not pay close attention ( if any ) to asymptotic regions , instead they use the binding energy to assess the convergence towards an eigenstate .",
    "the convergence of the energy , however , does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of the wavefunction in long - range regions .",
    "moreover , most microscopic models exploit computationally tractable bases , most commonly gaussians of one sort or the other . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to capture the slower exponential decay by using a large gaussian basis , but as argued in @xcite , quality precedes quantity when it comes to halo nuclei ; that is the shape of the basis functions matters more than the size of the basis .    in addition",
    ", existing microscopic structure models fail to provide input to reaction calculations of two - neutron halo nuclei . to feed reaction calculations , by themselves formulated in a few - body picture",
    ", one would have to extract information about halo particles from a full microscopic wavefunction which is a non - trivial task . even though recently we have witnessed some progress in this direction for two - body non - halo projectiles @xcite , most microscopic structure theories are still far from providing such few - body - like information about three - body - like halo nuclei .",
    "it is for this reason that in reaction calculations the structure of halo nuclei is taken from few - body models despite all their drawbacks .",
    "it is obvious that both few - body and microscopic structure models have their appealing aspects as well as drawbacks .",
    "it is the aim of this work to combine the best of the two worlds : to develop a fully microscopic model for light two - neutron halo nuclei bound by nucleon - nucleon interactions that would describe simultaneously short- and especially long - distance regions .",
    "the novelty of our model is the integration of few - body and ab - initio methods .",
    "we use a basis that describes short - range correlations and at the same time preserves the correct three - body asymptotics .",
    "this is achieved at a high computational cost since matrix elements can not be evaluated analytically . our ultimate goal is to provide microscopic structure information to be used in reaction calculations involving two - neutron halo nuclei .    in this paper our model",
    "is applied to the simplest two - neutron halo nucleus , @xmath0 .",
    "preliminary results for this case have been published in @xcite . since neither @xmath5 thought of as nor the subsystem are bound",
    ", @xmath0 is a borromean system @xcite . to provide input for reaction calculations involving this nucleus , two - neutron overlap functions are properly computed from our microscopic model and , to our best knowledge , they are for the first time expressed in hyper - spherical coordinates . by doing so ,",
    "these functions are directly applicable to some reaction calculations and they can be compared directly to three - body wavefunctions .",

    "the model here presented has as its primary goal the applicability to reactions involving light two - neutron halo nuclei and thus needs to capture few - body long - distance features of these systems .",
    "a two - neutron halo nucleus will be described by an antisymmetrized product of a microscopic core and a valence part consisting of two neutrons , or schematically .",
    "the terms  core \" and  valence \" refer to distinct pieces of the wavefunction prior to the action of the core - valence antisymmetrizer @xmath6 upon which nucleons from the two parts of the wavefunction become indistinguishable . at large distances , our wavefunction decouples into the three - body - like form of a desired shape most naturally expressed in jacobi",
    "it was therefore our choice from the early start to express the entire wavefunction in jacobi coordinates .",
    "as an additional benefit of using these coordinates , translational invariance is guaranteed .",
    "all details of the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the microscopic core with a fixed total angular momentum and parity @xmath7 , and isospin @xmath8 with projection @xmath9 is described by an antisymmetrized wavefunction @xmath10 corresponding to the core s ground state .",
    "if desired , excited states of the core can be included in the future .",
    "the valence terms are drawn from a suitable hyper - spherical basis .",
    "each valence basis function @xmath11 carries total angular momentum @xmath12 , and isospin @xmath13 with projection @xmath14 , which coupled to the core s quantum numbers give @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for the full system . for neutron - rich two - neutron halo nuclei , such as @xmath0 and @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and",

    "the wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ eq mich wavefunction ] ) is constructed in two steps .",
    "first , the wavefunction of the core as a free nucleus is built within svm , as briefly described in .",
    "unlike many microscopic cluster models employing a simple @xmath28-harmonic oscillator approximation to @xmath1 , we use the best possible wavefunction for the core obtainable within svm . by doing so , we hope to attenuate the problem of underbinding relative to the three - body threshold @xcite .",
    "once the core wavefunction is optimized , its parameters remain unchanged in the subsequent minimization procedure .",
    "this implies that , as in other microscopic cluster models , distortion of the core due to valence neutrons is not accounted for explicitly , although some distortion is delivered through the core - valence antisymmetrization . in the second step , the valence part is constructed by drawing terms @xmath29 from a hyper - spherical basis described in .",

    "two - neutron overlap functions are extracted from the resulting optimized wavefunctions , as presented in .",
    "our choice of the microscopic model for the core has been motivated by the following factors .",
    "the model should provide accurate structure for the core ; it needs to be extendable to cores heavier than @xmath1 ; and it must handle central and non - central nucleon - nucleon forces . unlike for the valence part , there is no need to impose special asymptotic requirements on the core .",
    "finally , as mentioned earlier in this section , the wavefunction of the core should be expressed in jacobi coordinates .",
    "it is for these reasons that the svm model seemed to be the most appropriate . in this section ,",
