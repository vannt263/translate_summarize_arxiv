    "topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted considerable attention in the recent years  @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis constitute a class of materials in which the inverted band structure of the insulating bulk is accompanied by the existence of metallic states at the surface  @xcite .",
    "these surface states consist of massless helical dirac fermions which are protected by time - reversal symmetry and which are therefore robust against non - magnetic backscattering .",
    "although discovered only recently , tis have been the subject of extensive research due to their inherently interesting properties and potential impact on the development of room - temperature spintronic devices  @xcite .",
    "also , the realization of a number of exotic physical phenomena , such as dyons  @xcite , majorana fermions  @xcite and axion dynamics  @xcite is anticipated in these materials .    while the ti surface states on _ in - situ _ prepared clean or adsorbate - covered surfaces",
    "have been examined in detail ( cf . refs .   as well as",
    "the references therein ) , studies of the interactions of tis with other materials , e.g. at heterostructure interfaces , are scarce up to now .",
    "nonetheless , investigations of such interaction effects will no doubt lead to an even better understanding of the tis and lay the foundation for the realization of concrete devices . in many semiconductor applications",
    "the properties of interfaces determine the operation characteristics of the device .",
    "hence , studying the phenomena occurring at the technology - relevant ti - semiconductor interface and possible applications of ti thin films , rather than bulk crystals , is of particular interest .",
    "previous works on bi@xmath0se@xmath1thin films have revealed a strong variation in the electronic band structure of the surface state as a function of film thickness  @xcite . when grown on a double - layer - graphene - terminated 6h - sic(0001 ) substrate , at thicknesses below 5 quintuple layers ( ql )",
    ", one ql is 9.5   thick , an energy gap opens at the dirac point as a result of the hybridization between dirac states originating from opposite sides of the film .",
    "the strength of the hybridization decreases rapidly with increasing film thickness until it is negligible for 6  ql films and the energy gap at the dirac point closes .",
    "the experimental observation of a gap in ultra - thin films provides indirect evidence for the existence of a dirac state at the interface towards the substrate .",
    "similar observations have been made in ( pbse)@xmath2(bi@xmath0se@xmath1)@xmath3 single crystals , where natural heterostructures consisting of ti ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) and normal - insulator ( pbse ) layers are formed  @xcite .",
    "in fact , theory predicts the existence of gapless topological dirac states at interfaces between topologically trivial materials and tis  @xcite .",
    "consequently , such states should exist at the interface between a ti thin film and an insulating substrate on which it is grown .",
    "however , so far no direct observation of buried _ non - hybridized _ interface states in ti films has been made .",
    "therefore , it is of fundamental interest to experimentally establish the existence of interface states in a ti - semiconductor junction by more direct means .",
    "additionally , a qualitative description of how the electron configuration in thin films is influenced by the presence of the substrate , including a band - alignment model for the junction , is desirable , something which thus far has only been discussed briefly  @xcite",
    ". the latter can provide valuable insights on how to `` tailor '' the electronic properties of a ti film , e.g. the position of the chemical potential , by changing properties of the substrate .",
    "such an understanding is the foundation needed to uncover novel phenomena as well as to realize practical device applications .",
    "here we address these issues through photoemission studies of ti thin films and ti thin - film heterostructures grown on silicon substrates , provide experimental evidence for the existence of decoupled dirac fermions at the substrate interface and show how the band bending across the film can be explained by band alignment between the film and the substrate at the interface .",
    "in the present work we have studied the electronic band structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1thin films and bi@xmath0te@xmath1/bi@xmath0se@xmath1thin - film heterostructures by means of laser - based angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "the experiments were conducted at the baltazar laser - arpes facility  @xcite ( kth , stockholm , sweden ) using an angle - resolving time - of - flight electron analyzer and a photon energy of 10.5  ev .",
    "the data were collected at @xmath4  k and at a base pressure of @xmath5  mbar .",
    "the combination of the low excitation energy and the cryogenic sample temperature increases the escape depth of the photoelectrons  @xcite , thus making the direct observation of buried interface states feasible .",
    "thin films of ( 0001)-oriented bi@xmath0se@xmath1were grown _ in situ _ by co - evaporation of bi and se onto a bi - terminated si(111)-(@xmath6 ) substrate following the method presented in ref .   which produces atomically flat , high quality , stoichiometric films .",
    "two different types of si(111 ) substrates were used , one arsenic doped ( @xmath7-type ) with a resistivity of 4  m@xmath8 cm ( determined by a hall measurement ) , and one boron doped ( @xmath9-type ) with a resistivity of 0.9  m@xmath8 cm ( si - mat silicon materials , germany ) .",
    "the substrates were prepared by repeated cycles of annealing at 1100  @xmath10c in order to achieve the ( @xmath6 ) surface reconstruction .",
    "the subsequent deposition of one monolayer ( 1  ml ) bi at a substrate temperature of 500  @xmath10c formed a si(111)@xmath11-bi surface on which the bi@xmath0se@xmath1film could be grown .",
    "the bi@xmath0se@xmath1thin films were grown by co - evaporation of high purity bi ( 99.999  % ) and se ( 99.999  % ) ( both from goodfellow cambridge ltd . , united kingdom ) using an electron - beam evaporator while keeping the substrate temperature at 270  @xmath10c .",
    "a quartz - crystal monitor was used to set the growth rates of bi and se prior to the deposition and the built - in flux monitor of the evaporator ensured a constant rate during the deposition .",
    "repeated tests showed that the best film quality was achieved when using a large se overdose .",
    "the typical growth rate and se overdose for the films in this study were about 2.5   per minute and 80  % , respectively .",
    "the procedure used for the bi - termination of the si(111)-(@xmath6 ) surface was identical for both types of substrates and all bi@xmath0se@xmath1films were deposited under similar conditions .",
    "thin - film bi@xmath0te@xmath1/bi@xmath0se@xmath1heterostructures were manufactured by deposition of 2  ql bi@xmath0te@xmath1on top of pre - grown 6  ql bi@xmath0se@xmath1 films .",
    "the procedure for growing bi@xmath0te@xmath1films was similar to the bi@xmath0se@xmath1case , i.e. with similar substrate temperature and a deposition rate of te comparable to that of se in the previous cases . during the preparation of the substrates and growth of the films",

    "both films are sufficiently thick so that hybridization between dirac states at opposite surfaces of the films is avoided . while the 6  ql film has a thickness which could allow the topologically protected state at the interface towards the substrate to be directly probed by a low - photon - energy arpes experiment , the @xmath1315  ql film is too thick for the interface state",

    "while the @xmath23 term is a result of the broken particle - hole symmetry in the bulk valence and conduction bands causing a parabolic correction to the surface state  @xcite , the @xmath24 term characterizes massive states in the presence of a gap  @xcite .",
    "the latter term always vanishes in our considerations of non - hybridized topologically protected states .",

    "in particular , a @xmath26 term is needed to account for the hexagonal warping  @xcite . to keep the model as simple as possible , we neglect these effects here and concentrate on the region of small @xmath25 , only .",
    "the hexagonal distortion of the dirac cone in this case is visible from approximately 250  mev above the dirac point up to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , only points from the region where no distortion of the cone is observed ( @xmath27 ) are included in the fit .",

    "in addition to the dirac states a parabolic conduction - band quantum - well state located at lower binding energy is observed .",
    "the model fitted to the thick - film data describes a single dirac state only .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate whether or not the additional spectral feature seen in the 6  ql case is in fact the interface state , we adopt the double - band model from ref .  .",
    "this model includes dirac cones located on opposite sides of the ti film and accounts for the structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) and the effective band bending induced by the presence of the substrate .",
    "the dispersion of the dirac states is then given by @xmath30 the term @xmath31 represents the band bending across the film and together with @xmath32 the model produces a set of two dirac cones with opposite helicities having their dirac points separated in energy by @xmath33 .",

    "we have also assumed that the dirac point is located in the center of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1band gap .",
    "figures  [ heterjunct](a ) and  [ heterjunct](b ) display the resulting band alignment for the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/si heterojunction .",
    "the upwards ( downwards ) band bending seen for the @xmath7-type ( @xmath9-type ) substrate is a result of the aforementioned pinning of @xmath15 at the surface . therefore , the energy difference @xmath39 at the substrate side of the interface is the same in the two cases ( 0.65  ev ) . for simplicity , the band bending across the thin film",
    "is assumed to be linear .",
    "if we instead use the electron - affinity rule  @xcite to determine the conduction - band offset , we obtain @xmath61  ev . the electron affinities @xmath62= 4.16 $ ]  ev ( ref .  ) and @xmath63bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xmath64\\sim5.3 $ ]  ev have been used .",
    "the latter is an estimate based on the value of the work function of bi@xmath0se@xmath1which is determined from the photoemission experiment .",
    "the similar values for @xmath58 obtained using the two approaches indicate that the sketched band alignment is qualitatively correct and that the pinned fermi level position of the substrate is little influenced by the presence of the ti film . also , the magnitude of @xmath58 at the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/si interface is comparable to the band gap of silicon .",
    "our results show that using si(111 ) substrates with very different doping levels does not influence the band bending through the bi@xmath0se@xmath1thin films , as initially expected , due to the pinning of the fermi level at the interface . on first sight",
    ", this seems to limit the possibilities of exploiting the bulk position of @xmath15 in the si substrate to modify the electronic configuration of ti thin films and places restrictions on the direction and magnitude of the band bending within the ti film as well as the binding - energy position of the dirac point of the interface state .",
    "however , this problem might be partly overcome by changing to a hydrogen - terminated si substrate . at the h - si(111 )",
    "surface the pinning of @xmath15 is removed  @xcite and the unpinned position is determined by the fermi level in the bulk .",
    "since the conduction - band offset @xmath58 at the interface is fixed , tuning of the chemical potential in the film by ca or mg doping  @xcite is expected to shift the surface dirac point towards lower binding energies .",
    "we propose the idea of using a heavily @xmath9-doped h - si(111 ) substrate combined with a @xmath9-doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1film to obtain the band alignment presented in fig .",
    "[ heterjunct](c ) .",
    "if the film is sufficiently doped , the chemical potential at the surface can be placed below the dirac point which would result in a hole - like surface state and an electron - like interface state as shown in fig .",
    "[ heterjunct](c ) .",
    "this system could then host bound electron - hole pairs , or excitons , and possibly permit the observation of a topological exciton condensate  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we observe that the band bending across the ti film in the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/si system , and thus the energy separation between the surface and interface states , is larger than for ti films grown on double - layer - graphene - terminated 6h - sic(0001 ) substrates  @xcite .",
    "since hybridization effects between electronic states become weaker with increasing energy difference , even if there is a finite spatial overlap between the states , the critical film thickness above which the surface states on opposite surfaces of a film are decoupled might very well be smaller in the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/si system as compared to the system described in ref .  .",
    "systematic studies of the thickness - dependent electronic structure in the ultra - thin limit of films grown on different substrates could therefore be of future interest .",
    "also beyond the scope of this work are further tests of the topologically protected nature of the states interacting with the substrate , for instance the observation of the formation of massive states at the interface as a result of breaking the time - reversal symmetry , e.g. in magnetic samples .    in summary ,",
    "the work presented in this article experimentally confirms the existence of decoupled electronic states localized at the interface between a trivial insulator and a topological insulator .",
    "similar to the surface state on bi@xmath0se@xmath1this interface state towards the si substrate exhibits a dirac - like linear dispersion . the band bending across the ti films , generated by the substrate , separates the dirac points of the interface and surface states .",
    "we anticipate that hydrogen termination of the si(111 ) substrate will allow the band bending across the film to be manipulated by changing the doping level and carrier type of the substrate .",
    "investigations of a ti - ti heterostructure consisting of a bi@xmath0te@xmath1/bi@xmath0se@xmath1junction shows that the surface state towards vacuum displays a clear bi@xmath0te@xmath1character while the interface state towards the si substrate remains bi@xmath0se@xmath1-like .",
    "our data do not provide any evidence for additional states arising from the presence of the bi@xmath0te@xmath1/bi@xmath0se@xmath1interface .",
    "eventually , our work demonstrates that the combination of low - temperature and low - photon - energy arpes permits direct studies of electronic states at buried interfaces .",
    "this opens up the possibility for further studies on , for example , interfaces in @xmath9-@xmath7 ti junctions and ti - heterojunctions or other exotic systems such as the superconductor - ti interface ."
