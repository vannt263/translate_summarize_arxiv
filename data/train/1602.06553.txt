    "in thermodynamic equilibrium a transition to a state with a spontaneous broken symmetry can be induced by a change in the external conditions ( such as temperature or pressure ) or in the control parameters ( such as an external applied field ) .",
    "the most widely studied examples are for systems at non - zero temperature , in the framework of classical phase transitions  @xcite . here , equilibrium thermal fluctuations are responsible for the critical behavior associated with the discontinuous change of the thermodynamic properties of the system",
    ". transitions may also occur at zero temperature , as a function of some coupling constant  @xcite ; in that case , since there are no thermal fluctuations , quantum fluctuations play a prominent role .",
    "for many decades , the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena has attracted the attention of a multitude of scientists from the most diverse fields of investigations : phase transitions are present at all energy scales , in cosmology and high - energy physics , as well as in condensed matter .    moving away from the thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "collective phenomena and ordering also appear in open systems , upon tuning the rate of transitions caused by the environment  @xcite .",
    "for example , they emerge in most diverse situations  @xcite ranging from the synchronous flashing of fireflies  @xcite to the evolution of financial markets  @xcite .",
    "the classical statistical mechanics of such driven systems ( including traffic models , active matter , and flocking ) has attracted an increasing attention over the years , see e.g. refs .",
    "such interest is in part due to the remarkable possibility of achieving ordered states that are not possible in equilibrium systems , displaying for example long - range order in two - dimensional flocking  @xcite , something forbidden by the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem  @xcite in equilibrium .",
    "thanks to the recent impressing experimental progresses , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , the investigation of non - equilibrium properties of driven - dissipative systems has entered the quantum world .",
    "rydberg atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , systems of trapped ions  @xcite , exciton - polariton condensates  @xcite , cold atoms in cavities  @xcite , arrays of coupled qed cavities  @xcite , are probably the most intensively investigated experimental platforms in relation to this aim .",
    "the predicted steady - state phase diagram of these driven dissipative systems becomes incredibly rich , displaying a variety of phenomena .",
    "just as for classical statistical mechanics , phases , which are not possible in an equilibrium phase diagram , may appear  @xcite . the steady state itself needs not be time - independent and the system may end up in a limit cycle  @xcite .",
    "renormalisation group ( rg ) calculations using the keldysh formalism have been performed  @xcite ; in some cases the universality class of the transitions may be modified both by the presence of the external environment and by non - equilibrium effects  @xcite .",
    "a judicious engineering of the system - bath couplings can lead to non - trivial many - body states in the stationary regime  @xcite .",
    "the field of dissipative many - body open systems embraces a much wider class of problems , ranging from transport to relaxation dynamics to quantum information processing ( just to mention few examples ) .",
    "a more comprehensive panorama of the recent literature can be also found in refs .",
    "@xcite and citations therein .    in condensed matter systems , most notably in josephson junction arrays",
    ", the impact of an external bath on the phase diagram , and the relative critical properties was thoroughly studied over the last twenty years , see e.g.  @xcite . in all those studies",

    "our work focuses on an important aspect of the physics of many - body open systems : the determination of the steady - state phase diagram .",
    "we are going to consider systems in which the coupling to the environment leads to a markovian dynamics . in these cases",

    "the second term , corresponding to a sum of lindbladian superoperators @xmath4 $ ] , takes into account the coupling to the external bath(s ) .",
    "the steady - state phase diagram is obtained by looking at the long - time limit ( @xmath5 ) of the solution to eq .   and computing appropriate averages @xmath6 \\equiv \\mbox{tr } \\big [ { \\hat o } \\ ,   \\rho_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\rm ss } \\big]$ ] of local observables @xmath7 , in order to determine the ( possible ) existence of phases with broken symmetries ( space , time , spin ,  )  @xcite .",
    "nearly all the results obtained so far on the phase diagram ( with the notable exception of the works based on keldysh rg mentioned above ) rely on the ( single - site ) mean - field approximation , where all the correlations are ignored .",
    "very little is known beyond that limit about the interplay between many - body correlations and dissipation , although there are some contributions in this direction  @xcite .",
    "while quasi - exact numerical methods exist for open one - dimensional systems , unfortunately no true phase transitions are expected to occur in that context . beyond one dimension ,",
    "such methods are much harder to apply .",
    "however it is well known that the mean - field decoupling , while important to grasp the salient features of the system , is not at all accurate in locating the phase boundaries .",
    "an improvement in the determination of the phase diagram can be obtained by a systematic inclusion of short - range correlations ( up to a given cluster size ) . in equilibrium , this has been achieved within the cluster mean - field approximation  @xcite , and using linked cluster expansions  @xcite . in the cluster mean - field approach , the accuracy of the diagram is obviously related to the size of the considered cluster .",
    "even though it is still mean - field in nature , a suitable scheme that combines it with finite - size scaling may in principle allow to extract non - classical critical exponents  @xcite . in higher dimensions ( above the lower critical one ) where one expects spontaneous symmetry breaking , cluster methods lead only to quantitative corrections ( a mere shift ) to the mean - field predictions .",
    "these corrections become smaller on increasing the dimensionality .    for equilibrium phase transitions ,",
    "the topology of the phase diagram is well captured at the mean - field level , and the short - range fluctuations considered by cluster methods only lead to shifts in the location of the transition lines / points .",
    "normally , they do not cut an ordered phase into two separate parts , divided by a disordered region . the possibility to have a radical change of topology is however permitted out of equilibrium , where the spontaneous breaking of symmetry is of pure dynamical nature : terms which are formally irrelevant in the rg sense",
    "can nonetheless modify the flow of rg - relevant terms , so as to move a point in parameter space from one side to the other side of a phase boundary .",
    "such a scenario is rarely , if ever , seen in equilibrium .    .",
    "the single - site mean - field as worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite would predict the emergence of different phases : paramagnetic ( pm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , and spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ( inset to the top panel ) . here",
    "we focus on the region highlighted by the red box , which displays a transition from pm to fm states ( magnified in the top panel ) .",
    "a proper inclusion of short - range correlations ( through the cluster mean - field ) shrinks the ferromagnetic region to a small `` island '' , thus suppressing the order at large couplings and hinting to a possible incommensurate ( inc ) ordering ( bottom panel ) . ]",
    "we demonstrate that the above picture is indeed verified in the open many - body context , and ordering with a non - trivial spatial pattern may emerge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) . the most natural way to show",
    "this is to include correlations through a cluster mean - field analysis which , to the best of our knowledge , has never been systematically applied in the open many - body context .",
    "although the general strategy is the same as for equilibrium systems , there are several peculiarities emerging in this scenario , which need to be carefully addressed .",
    "the steady - state solution typically needs to be obtained dynamically via eq .",
    "( and not through a solution of a self - consistent equation  @xcite ) .",
    "to increase the cluster size , we introduce a new approach that combines the cluster mean field with quantum trajectories  @xcite and with matrix - product - operators  @xcite .",
    "we apply our technique to a spin-1/2 xyz - model with relaxation ( as previously studied by lee _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and show that the short - range correlations captured by the cluster approach can have a dramatic effect on the phase diagram .",
    "this last point is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ( that summarises one of our main results ) .",
    "a mean - field analysis predicts a transition from a paramagnet to a ferromagnet ( upper panel ) in the whole region of large couplings @xmath8 .",
    "the lower panel sketches the outcome of the cluster analysis . the ferromagnetic regime has shrunk to a finite region disappearing in the limit of large couplings . for an equilibrium system ,",
    "such behavior would be very strange : large coupling strengths increase the tendency toward ferromagnetic order , yet here we find that the ordered state is destroyed by strong couplings .",
    "furthermore , indications from a stability analysis hint at a different type of ordering at large values of @xmath9 .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the spin-1/2 model with nearest - neighbor xyz interactions coupled to a local bath , which will be considered in the following .",

    "it is important to remark that an in - plane xy anisotropy ( @xmath19 ) is fundamental to counteract the dissipative spin flips along the orthogonal direction  @xcite . in the case",
    "in which @xmath20 , eq .",
    "reduces to an xxz heisenberg model . since this latter conserves the global magnetisation along the @xmath17 axis , the steady - state solution @xmath21 of eq .",

    "hereafter we concentrate in the regime of parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the single - site mean field predicts a single ferromagnetic ( fm ) to paramagnetic ( pm ) phase transition . indeed by changing the various coupling constants , the pm phase may become unstable and the system can acquire a finite magnetisation along the @xmath27 plane ( @xmath28 ) , thus entering a fm phase .",

    "as discussed in detail in sec  [ sec:2d ] , our calculations show that , on improving the ansatz for the steady - state density matrix by including short - range correlations , the critical points may shift from @xmath230 to a finite value of @xmath9 .",
    "this situation may appear as counterintuitive .",
    "it is indeed unlikely to occur at equilibrium , where the inclusion of short - range fluctuations may only lead to a shift of the boundary position of the order of the energy fluctuations inside the cluster [ @xmath231 in this case ] . in this section",
    "we want to explain the mechanism responsible for this behavior .",
    "this will also help us to elucidate the nature of the pm phase observed at large @xmath9 within the cmf approach and , consequently , the re - entrance to a disordered phase . to this aim",
    "it is sufficient to compare the single - site with the @xmath232 ( two - site ) cluster cases .",
    "we consider this minimal cluster dimension for simplicity , since taking larger clusters would not add new ingredients to the understanding of the mechanism .",
    "first , it is important to stress that , already at the single - site mf , a steady state with vanishing spontaneous magnetization in all the directions is predicted in the limit @xmath167 . as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magnmf_1vs2 ] ( for fixed @xmath173 and @xmath26 ) , two phases emerge : a pm for @xmath233 and a fm for @xmath234 , with magnetization along @xmath171 ( or equivalently along @xmath125 ) initially increasing , but then decreasing asymptotically toward zero as @xmath9 is increased .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the progressive deterioration of the purity of the steady - state density matrix , @xmath235 $ ] , for @xmath236 .",
    "this comes as a consequence of the out - of - equilibrium nature of the steady - state resulting from the interplay of driving and dissipation and can not occur at equilibrium , where an increasing coupling typically stabilizes the ordering .",
    "a similar kind of behavior can be seen in a driven two - level system  @xcite where increasing driving enhances the population , but suppresses the purity of the system , leading to a suppression of the homodyne ampltitude @xmath237 and of the purity when driven on resonance .",
    "we see that @xmath238 in the pm phase and then it decreases toward its minimal value ( @xmath239 in the case of a single - site cluster ) as @xmath9 is increased beyond the critical value @xmath240 .",
    "this suggests the fact that the disordered phase detected for @xmath241 is different in nature compared to the one reached in the large-@xmath9 limit for the cluster mean - field simulation .",
    "the former is due to the stabilization of a fully polarized along the @xmath17 direction , which coincides with the single - site mf solution for any @xmath242 ( while it is the exact solution to the problem only for @xmath20 ) .",
    "the latter pm phase is a consequence of the fact that the steady - state for @xmath243 is fully mixed .",
    "( solid black line ) , @xmath171 ( dashed black line ) directions and purity @xmath244 $ ] ( solid red line ) as a function of @xmath9 , for fixed @xmath173 , @xmath26 .",
    "the single - site mf ( @xmath148 , top panel ) predicts a pm phase for @xmath233 and a fm phase for @xmath234 . on the contrary , according to a cmf analysis ( @xmath232 , lower panel ) , the fm phase shrinks down to a finite region @xmath245 allowing the re - entrance of a pm phase for @xmath246 . ]",
    "what is the effect of including short range correlations ? in order to understand this point , let us consider more in detail the smallest cluster where this feature can be observed , namely a @xmath232 plaquette . as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magnmf_1vs2 ] , the fm phase now shrinks to a finite region going from @xmath247 to @xmath248 , so that the pm for @xmath167 stabilizes over an extended region @xmath246 .",
    "the steady - state purity indicates a nearly pure state in the left pm region , @xmath249 , that has to be contrasted with a nearly fully mixed state in the right pm region , @xmath246 ( the minimal value for a two - site cluster is @xmath250 ) .",
    "thus , the exact inclusion of the nearest neighbor correlations allows for the reentrance of a pm phase for @xmath246 . at single - site mf level",
    ", such pm phase appears only in the limiting case @xmath251 and then is never detectable for any finite value of the couplings .",
    "we remark that the decreasing of the purity , and the consequent reduction of the magnetizations , as @xmath9 is increased is a common nonequilibrium feature of the two anstze ( @xmath148 and @xmath232 ) . while in the @xmath148 case",
    "the purity reduction is not enough to kill the fm order , in the @xmath232 plaquette this reduction of purity is more prominent and the latter phenomenon ( suppression of magnetization ) occurs .",
    "the equations of motion in the heisenberg picture for magnetization @xmath252 ( @xmath253 ) are @xmath254 \\\\    & & \\hspace*{1.5 cm } -\\frac\\gamma2 \\big [ { \\left < \\sigma^\\beta_j \\right > }       + \\delta_{\\beta",
    "z}({\\left < \\sigma^\\beta_j \\right>}+2 ) \\ , \\big ] ,    \\label{2x1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath255 is the levi - civita symbol and @xmath256 is the kronecker delta",
    ". the steady - state density matrix in the @xmath232 plaquette for @xmath257 can be analytically computed , and is _ almost _ fully mixed .",
    "therefore it can can be written as @xmath258 }   \\approx \\rho^{\\scriptscriptstyle [ 1 ] } \\otimes \\rho^{\\scriptscriptstyle [ 2]}$ ] .",
    "the two - point spin correlator appearing in eq .",
    "can be thus decomposed as @xmath259 where @xmath260 . inserting this expression into eq .   and",
    "exploiting translational invariance we get @xmath261 }     -2 \\ , \\sum_{\\alpha } j_\\alpha \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}{\\left < \\sigma^{\\gamma,\\alpha}_{j , j+1 } \\right>},\\ ] ] where @xmath262}$ ] are the terms one would get from the single - site mf .",
    "equation   shows that spin - spin correlations correct the single - site mf equations of motion only through the small term @xmath263 . on the other hand we know that , for @xmath246 , the steady - state properties can change dramatically when considering a single site or a plaquette as a cluster : in the former case one gets a ferromagnet , while in the latter case one gets a paramagnet .",
    "spin - spin correlations , even if very weak , can not be neglected and drastically modify the structure of the density matrix at long times .",
    "these conspire with the dynamically induced reduction of purity at large @xmath9 , already visible for the single siste mean - field , to suppress the ordering altogether .",
    "this is the key to understand the dramatic changes in the phase boundaries we presented in the previous sections .",
    "we believe that the mechanism is generic and should be relevant for other driven - dissipative models as well .",
    "in this work we introduced a cluster mean - field approach combined with quantum trajectories and tensor - network techniques to the study of the steady - state phase diagram in driven - dissipative systems .",
    "this approach allowed us to analyze the effect of short - range correlations .",
    "the result is somewhat unexpected .",
    "the whole structure of the phase diagram is radically modified in clear opposition to what typically happens in equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "in particular , we observed that the location of critical points may shift from infinite to finite values of the system parameters .",
    "the reason underlying this behavior is related to the fact that , differently from equilibrium , spontaneous symmetry breaking is of pure dynamical nature and is not determined through a free - energy analysis .",
    "it is already known that in dissipative systems , energy - minimizing ferromagnetic phases may be destabilized , and replaced by incommensurate or antiferromagnetic order .",
    "such behaviour has been extensively studied in classical pattern forming systems  @xcite , including examples such as active matter and flocking  @xcite . as such",
    ", short range correlations can be expected to play a much greater role in dissipative than in equilibrium systems .",
    "accordingly , the topology of the phase diagram can significantly change .",
    "this appears clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , where the results from the single - site and the cluster mean - field analysis are compared .",
    "furthermore , the cluster method hints at ordering with a non - trivial spatial pattern , a possibility which is not detected within the single - site mean - field ansatz .",
    "the results that we highlighted here are amenable to an experimental verification . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model considered in this paper can be implemented using trapped ions .",
    "moreover , by changing external controls it is possible to explore the phase diagram , thus allowing to check the results of the present work .",
    "besides the examined system , we think that cluster approaches may be powerful in the general context of driven - dissipative systems , ranging from rydberg atoms in optical lattices to cavity or opto - mechanical arrays .",
    "our findings point out the importance of the interplay between short - range fluctuations and dissipation in the physics emerging in such devices .",
    "all the present analysis has been performed by considering a static mean field .",
    "it would be of great interest to extend these calculations so as to include also self - energy corrections as in the dynamical mean field , already extended to non - equilibrium for the single - site case  @xcite .",
    "finally we believe that a very interesting development , left for the future , is the determination of the non - landau critical exponents",
    ". when successful , this will be an important step to establish the power of cluster techniques also in many - body open systems . on this perspective , the combination of our approach with the corner space renormalization method developed in ref .",
