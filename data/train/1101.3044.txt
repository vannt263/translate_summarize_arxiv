    "its intensity would decrease and shift to higher energies as the zrb is depleted of occupied states due to the shifting fermi level .",
    "this effect was discussed in the theoretical rixs studies of tsutsui et al.@xcite and markiewicz and bansil@xcite , and earlier studies by wagner et .",
    "al.@xcite that more than half of the intensity disappears by high doping ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3ev_fitparams](b ) ) suggests that the fermi level traversed the greater part of the zrb .",
    "this would be in partial agreement with the recent near - edge absorption study of peets et al.@xcite , who observed that the oxygen _",
    "k_-edge absorption peak grows with doping but then saturates above @xmath12=0.22 , a possible indication that there are no additional states to be gained from the zrb as the fermi level passes its bottom .",
    "+ however , an energy shift of @xmath90.6 ev seen in fig .  [ fig:3ev_fitparams](a ) seems inconsistent with the known fermi level shift of 0.3 ev.@xcite one would expect it to shift _ less _ than the fermi level , yet here it shifts by more than twice as much .",
    "it is quite possible that part of this major discrepancy is due to the specific model used in the fitting . when an additional high - energy peak at 5.6 ev was included to better fit the data , the energy shift up to @xmath12=0.25 seemed to correspond more closely to the fermi - level shift .",
    "such an additional peak might be a lower hubbard band ( lhb ) to zrb transition .",
    "on the other hand , this discrepancy may be also due to a fundamental failure of the rigid band model assumption .",
    "in the recent dynamic mean field study by demedici et al.@xcite , for example , the lower - energy part of the uhb is greatly reduced upon hole doping ( less than 20% at @xmath12=0.15 ) , which would result in increased transition energy .",
    "while this could qualitatively explain a larger upward shift in the peak as the doping increases , theoretical calculations will be needed to explore these questions rigourously .",
    "+ finally , we briefly discuss the 2.2 ev peak at * * q**@xmath9(0 0 ) , which sharply decreases in intensity upon light doping , whether by sr or ni , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcno ] . it is possibly an excitonic excitation,@xcite although such an interpretation has been contested in the literature.@xcite in their recent electron energy - loss spectroscopy study of @xmath45 , schuster et al .",
    "explained the decrease of the exciton peak on doping as an unbinding of the exciton due to screening from mobile charge carriers.@xcite however , the doped holes in lcno are not mobile , although they do reside in the cu - o plane,@xcite which therefore casts doubt on this picture for the 2.2 ev peak reduction in the case of lcno .",
    "we also note that the lcno sample is magnetically ordered , while the doped lsco sample is not , so it would also seem that the loss of magnetic order does not play a role .",
    "a more detailed study of a series of lightly doped samples may clarify the behavior of this peak .",
    "in summary , we have carried out an investigation of rixs spectra in a series of doped lanthanum cuprates as a function of doping and momentum transfer , with a view of prompting more detailed theoretical studies .",
    "a 2.2 ev peak observed at the zone center rapidly diminishes , both with sr and ni doping .",
    "further mesaurements in the low doping region may help to explain this sharp reduction . in the zone - boundary * * q**=(@xmath5 , 0 ) spectra , we were able to characterize three major spectral features , with spectral weight being transferred systematically from the high energy to the low energy peaks as doping increases . at higher energies ,",
    "the spectra can be described as two peaks over a wide doping range , one at 4.5 ev which is independent of doping , the other at 3.3 ev which decreases in intensity , and increases in energy approximately linearly with doping .",
    "we assigned these peaks to transitions from lower - lying bands ( llb ) @xmath6 upper - hubbard band ( uhb ) and zhang - rice band ( zrb ) @xmath6 upper - hubbard band ( uhb ) transitions respectively . at lower energies a near - infrared ( nir )",
    "peak was observed , we assign this to a llb@xmath6zrb transition .",
    "it has zero dispersion along the ( 0 0)-(@xmath5 , 0 ) direction .",
    "a peak appears at around the same @xmath91.7 ev energy for all dopings , although around @xmath12=0.12 it appears small compared to the continuum intensity which increases at this doping . in the overdoped region ,",
    "the nir peak width increases dramatically , and the peak energy red - shifts with increased doping .",
    "our comparative study of lsco and lbco suggests a possible connection between the nir peak and charge stripes .",
