    "the most massive and dense clusters are consistent with being young analogues of ancient globular clusters like those in our own milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the prevalence of globular clusters around massive galaxies today suggests that these extreme star clusters were forming ubiquitously in the early universe as galaxies began to merge and coalesce hierarchically .",
    "young massive clusters ( ymcs ) continue to play an important role in the evolution of the universe .",
    "ymcs and their constituent massive stars ionize the interstellar medium , power the infrared radiation of dust , produce heavy elements , and trigger further star formation via supernova explosions . in addition ,",
    "the most massive ymcs , known as `` super star clusters '' ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* and reference therein for overviews ) , are packed with hundreds to thousands of o and b stars .",
    "these extreme clusters can drastically alter the morphology of their host galaxy when the massive stars collectively explode at the end of their lives , expelling huge amounts of gas and blowing galactic - scale superbubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the importance of massive stars and massive clusters , their formation and earliest evolutionary stages are not well understood @xcite .",
    "we do know , however , that nearly all massive stars form in clusters and that ymcs host large numbers of massive stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to being interesting in their own right , ymcs provide important laboratories for studying the clustered mode of massive star formation , a crucial part of understanding massive star formation in general .",
    "interest in massive extragalactic star clusters was sparked by the discovery of a population of ymcs in the peculiar galaxy ngc  1275 by @xcite using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. since then , young massive clusters have been found in a large number of galaxy systems , primarily at optical wavelengths with _ hst _ ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",

    "we present our study of embedded massive clusters in the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  4449 .",
    "ngc  4449 is a barred magellanic - type irregular galaxy @xcite with star formation occurring throughout the galaxy at a rate almost twice that of the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "ngc  4449 has almost certainly undergone an external perturbation , as is evident in hi  studies revealing extended streamers wrapping around the galaxy and counter - rotating ( inner and outer ) gas systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the proximity of ngc  4449 is advantageous for extragalactic star cluster research since relatively small spatial scales can be probed .",
    "the work of @xcite has already revealed @xmath8 optically - selected compact star clusters .",
    "we adopt a distance of 3.9 mpc , consistent with recent work by @xcite , and thus 1=19  pc .    using high - resolution radio imaging",
    ", we identify the youngest embedded star clusters in ngc  4449 .",
    "the observed ultra - dense hii  regions are produced when hot massive stars within the clusters ionize the surrounding gas and are identified as compact free - free ( thermal ) radio sources .",
    "a previous catalog of radio detected hii  regions in ngc  4449 was presented by @xcite using an nrao 3-element image at 11  cm ( 2.7  ghz ) from @xcite with a beam size of @xmath9 and an rms noise of 0.40.6 mjy  beam@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite derived a list of eight hii  regions that had counterparts in the optical h@xmath11 data of @xcite .",
    "the optical sizes were 1020  and the 11  cm flux densities were 110 mjy .",
    "@xcite also calculated the radio to h@xmath11 derived extinction for seven objects and compared these values with the balmer decrement derived extinctions for a single object ( cm 39 ) .    compared to the nrao 3-element image at 11  cm used by @xcite , the current very large array ( vla ) survey at 3.6 cm has a sensitivity that is improved by a factor of @xmath0  40 and a beam solid angle that is smaller by a factor of @xmath0  40 . in the present work ,",
    "we combine high - quality vla data and archival images from the _ hubble _ and _ spitzer space telescopes _ with stellar population synthesis models in order to discern the physical properties of the radio - detected star clusters in ngc  4449 and gain insight into the earliest evolutionary phases experienced by massive star clusters .",

    "the sources 3c48 and 3c286 were used as flux density calibrators , and we estimate that the absolute flux density calibration is @xmath12% , based on the scatter in the vla flux density calibrator database . the high - frequency observations at k - band utilized fast - switching to a nearby phase calibrator , dispaced by @xmath0  5 , in order to mitigate the effect of the atmosphere .",
    "these data were reduced and calibrated using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . in order to better match the largest spatial scale to which the observations at each wavelength is sensitive , antenna spacings of @xmath13  k@xmath14 were not used .",
    "additionally , in order to achieve synthesized beams of approximately the same size at each wavelength , the three data sets were imaged with different weighting of the uv - coverage , ranging from purely natural weighting at 6  cm to slightly uniform weighting at 1.3  cm .",
    "the data were convolved to identical beams of 13 @xmath7 13 in the imaging process to better facilitate comparison between wavelengths . despite our best efforts , it should be noted that it is not possible to precisely match the uv - coverage at each wavelength , and there are slight variations in sensitivity to different spatial scales .",

    "this likeness is not surprising since both observations trace dense ionized gas .",
    "the 3.6  cm and 24  @xmath1 m images are also strikingly similar , indicating that the presence of warm dust is almost exclusively associated with the ultra - dense hii  regions in the galaxy .",
    "the circles in figure  [ multiwave_ims ] are centered on two example radio sources : one with and one without counterparts in the other wavebands .",
    "source 30 ( to the ne ) has both optical and infrared counterparts , suggesting this stellar cluster is in the process of emerging from its birth material , all the while ionizing the surrounding gas and heating the dust .",

    "we will return to the radio sources without optical or infrared counterparts in  [ pureradio ] .",
    "in order to study the emergence of young massive star clusters , we first use radio continuum imaging to identify potential clusters surrounded by ultra - dense hii  regions ( see fig .",
    "[ clusters_contours ] for some examples ) .",
    "we then measure the ultraviolet to radio flux densities of the radio - selected sources ( in the vla and _ hst _ images ) using a new photometry code that we developed ( surphot ) , allowing for consistent _ irregular _ apertures and background annuli across multiple wavebands .",
    "surphot is first used to detect a specified contour level in a selected region of the 3.6 cm image which is used as a reference .",
    "a source is selected and the contour may be used for the aperture in all of the images . alternatively , an ellipse , circle or free - form aperture can be used if appropriate ( e.g. nearby yet distinct sources that are contained within the same contour ) .",
    "a background annulus is constructed by radially expanding the chosen aperture by specified factors ( typically 1.75@xmath7 and 2.5@xmath7 ) .",
    "the pixel coordinates of the aperture and background annulus are transformed between images using their fits world coordinate systems ( wcs ) which relate image pixels to sky coordinates . in this way ,",
    "flux densities are computed in all ( 11 ) of the vla and _ hst _ images using identical apertures and background annuli .",

    "the focus of this work is on extremely young massive clusters and centimeter radio emission is a good indicator of youth .",
    "in addition , the resolution of the vla images ( 13 ) is larger than the resolutions of the _ hst _ images ( @xmath0  0102 ) .",
    "we note that using a larger aperture than the intrinsic size of a stellar cluster ( in the _ hst _ data ) allows for the possibility of contamination from an underlying or surrounding stellar population within the apertures . however , this effect is not likely to be very significant since the stellar light is domiated by the clusters of interest and we perform background subraction in the photometry .",
    "thermal radio sources are recognized as having flat or positive radio spectral energy distributions ( @xmath21 ) , indicative of free - free emission from dense ionized gas associated with young massive star clusters .",
    "non - thermal sources have decreasing radio seds characteristic of supernova remnants and ( background ) active galactic nuclei .",
    "here we are concerned with the thermal sources in ngc  4449 , which must be disentangled from the non - thermal sources by calculating the spectral indices , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , using the measured flux densities .",
    "we use the 3.6 cm radio image as our reference for both source identification and as the reference image in surphot .",
    "the 1.3 cm image is somewhat less likely to suffer from non - thermal contamination or self - absorption but the sensitivity is lower than the 3.6 cm image by a factor of @xmath0  2 at best ( the image quality is degraded farther from the center of the 1.3  cm image ) .",
    "source selection is based on a @xmath15 detection threshold , where @xmath20 is the local rms noise ( see fig .",
    "[ sourcemap ] ) .",
    "we estimate the minimum uncertainty in the measured radio flux densities as this local rms noise . in many cases ,",
    "however , the dominant source of uncertainty comes from the choice of aperture . for faint sources , estimates of the background level can also lead to large uncertainties .",
    "we therefore make multiple flux measurements for each source , varying these parameters .",
    "the fluctuations in these measurements are accounted for in our final reported values of flux densities and spectral indices , which are given in table  [ vlaflux ] along with the coordinates of the 39 radio sources identified in ngc  4449 . in the cases of weak or non - detections in the 6.0 and 1.3 cm images ,",
    "@xmath15 detection limits are given for the flux densities .",
    "corresponding limits are given for the spectral indices .",
    "sources are designated as either ( likely ) thermal , non - thermal , or mixed / uncertain based on their spectral indices as described above .",
    "of the 39 radio sources , 13 are thermal , 22 are uncertain or composed of mixed sources and 4 are non - thermal .    of the 4 definitive non - thermal sources ,",
    "3 appear to be associated with the galaxy ( sources 13 , 14 , & 39 ) while source 6 is most likely a background agn with no optical counterpart .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite have given a modern summary of the 30 year history of the radio light curve of j1228 + 441 .",
    "source 13 may also be a snr , although it appears to be at least partially embedded in an hii  region .",
    "source 39 is quite intriguing .",
    "the radio emission is partially associated with an obvious point - like optical counterpart ( probably a snr ) within a larger bi - conical shaped hii  region ( see fig .",

    "the youngest clusters will have the most intense uv radiation fields and they are also the most likely to have a clumpy dust structure , both of which would increase the intensity of the ere and hence the _ i_-band excess . over time , the clumpy dust structure may be dispersed and/or the radiation field may modify / destroy the ere carrier , both causing the _ i_-band excess to decrease and then disappear all together .",
    "ere offers a favorable hypothesis for the _ i_-band excess , although spectroscopic follow - up is required for confirmation .",
    "it is also important to note that if ere is the cause of the _ i_-band excess , the _ h_-band excess likely has a different origin .",
    "contributions from hot dust , embedded stars and red supergiants are all possible .",
    "we are currently undertaking follow - up spectroscopic and photometric observations of ngc  4449 to further investigate the _",
    "i_- and _ h_-band excesses .",
    "figure  [ deredmvhaew ] illustrates that while m@xmath66 and h@xmath11 flux are positively correlated ( as expected ) , m@xmath66 and h@xmath11 equivalent width are anti - correlated .",
    "in other words , fainter clusters have relatively more h@xmath11 emission with respect to the stellar continuum than brighter clusters .",
    "this can be interpreted as a mass - age correlation , since m@xmath66 generally traces cluster mass ( modulo extinction ) and h@xmath11 equivalent width traces age . the two most trivial , and unsatisfying , interpretations of this trend are 1 ) the low - mass clusters formed more recently than the high - mass clusters , and 2 ) smaller clusters coalesce and make larger clusters over time .",
    "however , we note that there is no observed correlation between cluster size ( measured by aperture size ) and h@xmath11 equivalent width .    a third interpretation of the apparent mass - age correlation for clusters in this work ( with ages @xmath12  myr ) , although purely speculative , is the following",
    ". is is possible that the observed correlation is actually the imprint of an evolutionary sequence , where the youngest clusters merely appear less massive than their older counterparts .",
    "first , relative to more evolved clusters , younger clusters are likely to contain a higher fraction of dust enshrouded , optically veiled stars .",
    "these heavily embedded stars would not contribute to the integrated _ v_-band flux , yet the young optically visible stars within the clusters would still produce large h@xmath11 equivalent widths revealing their young ages . therefore , younger clusters may tend to appear less massive .",
    "in addition , if the younger clusters have a majority of their mass in the optically veiled sub - population of stars , it would not be surprising that the masses inferred from the nebular emission ( i.e. radio and h@xmath11 equivalent width , which are mostly unaffected by extinction ) are higher than those inferred from the stellar emission ( which only samples the optically visible `` emerged '' stars ) as is apparent in figure  [ mass_thermal ] .",
    "a second factor that could contribute to the apparent mass - age correlation is stellar winds .",
    "more massive clusters will have disproportionately strong stellar winds , which could preferentially clear away the gas .",
    "a lower gas fraction will result in a lower equivalent width , and therefore a larger inferred age . as a result",
    ", more massive clusters would tend to appear older by virtue of their dearth of ionized gas .",
    "a deficiency of ionized gas could also explain why the more massive clusters tend to have higher mass estimates from sed fitting than those derived from the nebular emission ( fig .  [ mass_thermal ] ) .",
    "ngc  4449 is thought to have undergone some type of interaction in its past @xcite , which has likely influenced the global star formation history of the galaxy over the last @xmath77  gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "local processes such as stellar winds and supernovae ( perhaps the result of a previous burst ) , however , seem to be playing a significant role in triggering the _ current _ bursts of star formation , resulting in the formation of massive clusters detected in the radio .",
    "figure  [ superbubble ] illustrates that the formation of a number of radio sources appears to have been triggered by an expanding superbubble .",
    "taken alone , the fact that seven sources ( 23 , 24 , 25 , 28 , 30 , 37 , & 39 ) lie along the same circular arc ( radius = 44= 832 kpc ) could be viewed as a coincidence , albeit an unlikely one . however , previous observations of gas and dust in ngc  4449 suggest otherwise .",
    "hi , co and cold dust appear to be depressed or almost absent in this region of the galaxy ( e.g. fig .  1 in * ? ?",
    "* ) while soft diffuse x - ray emission fills it in ( fig .  5 in @xcite and fig .  10 in @xcite )",
    "in addition , kinematic studies of ngc  4449 are consistent with the stellar component of the galaxy observed face - on @xcite , which would account for the sources lying on a circular arc in projection .",
    "all of this evidence supports the view of an expanding superbubble triggering several sites of star formation in ngc  4449 .     for more discussion.[superbubble ] ]    further evidence of triggered star formation is apparent within ngc  4449 .",
    "an h@xmath11 shell with radius @xmath78 pc is observed in the sw region of the galaxy ( see figs .  [ multiwave_ims ] & [ closeups ] ) surrounding numerous optically visible stars and clusters , whose stellar winds and supernovae likely produced the shell , while six radio sources ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , & 7 ) are found along the periphery of this shell .",
    "it is possible that a collision between this shell and the larger superbubble is responsible for compressing the gas in the southern region of the galaxy and triggering the formation of sources 18 , 20 , and 21 .",
    "another group of radio sources ( 3136 ) is found along a smaller h@xmath11 loop ( radius @xmath79 pc ) in the ne region of the galaxy , again containing optically visible stellar clusters that could have triggered the current local burst of star formation .",
    "a close inspection of figures  [ multiwave_ims ] & [ closeups ] reveals that at least a few radio sources in ngc  4449 do not have optical counterparts ( e.g. sources 20 , 24 , & 28 ) . sources 24 & 28 also do not appear to have any detectable 24  @xmath1 m emission associated with them .",
    "it is unclear whether this is the case for the other radio sources without optical counterparts due to confusion in the 24  @xmath1 m image .",
    "in addition , the `` pure '' radio sources have only been detected at 3.6 cm and we can not determine whether they are thermal .",
    "we do believe these sources are in the galaxy and not background objects because their locations are associated with star forming regions . with the current data , however , we can only speculate about the nature of these sources .",
    "if the sources are thermal , the lack of h@xmath11 could be explained by heavy extinction from dust . for sources 24 & 28 , the extinctions would have to be at least @xmath0  7 visual magnitudes (  [ extinction ] ) . again , if we assume these sources are thermal , they are probably younger than the radio detected clusters with optical counterparts ( @xmath80  myr ) .",
    "they would also have relatively low ionizing fluxes ( the equivalent of @xmath0  615 o7.5 v stars ) and masses .",
    "these young ages and low masses would be consistent with the observed correlation between derived masses and ages for the thermal radio sources _ with _ optical counterparts .",
    "however , if the visibly obscured sources are heavily embedded clusters , we would expect them to produce thermal emission from heated dust and be observable in the mid - ir which does not seem to be the case ( at least for sources 24 & 28 ) .",
    "it may be more likely that these `` pure '' radio sources are supernova remnants , since non - thermal emission is anti - correlated with bright mid - ir emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented a multi - wavelength study of emerging massive star clusters in the irregular starburst galaxy ngc  4449 .",
    "we combine sensitive , high resolution vla radio observations with ultraviolet , optical and infrared data from the _ hubble _ and _ spitzer space telescope _ archives to obtain a comprehensive view of star formation occurring within the galaxy and to determine the physical properties of the radio - detected star clusters .",
    "we summarize the results of our study below :    1 .",
    "we identify 13 thermal radio sources in ngc  4449 .",
    "these sources have ages @xmath12  myr ( based on h@xmath11 equivalent widths ) , ionizing fluxes between @xmath0  2070  @xmath42  s@xmath10 ( the equivalent of @xmath0  2070 o7.5 v stars ) , and stellar masses between @xmath0  0.55  @xmath43  m@xmath4 .",

    "model seds modified by a 30 doradus extinction curve fit the clusters broad - band ultraviolet and optical flux densities ( @xmath82 ) significantly better than the standard galactic extinction curve and the starburst obscuration curve of @xcite .",

    "i_-band excess ( with respect to model seds ) that is anti - correlated with age . in the most extreme cases , the _",
    "i_-band magnitudes are more than 1 magnitude brighter the best - fitting model seds",
    ". we do not expect clusters with ages @xmath83  myr to have this excess . a photoluminescent process , known as extended red emission , provides a favorable hypothesis for the cause of the observed _ i_-band excess . 5 .",
    "the 7 nuclear clusters with nicmos data exhibit a large ( @xmath84 mag ) _",
    "h_-band excess .",
    "we speculate that some combination of red supergiants , thermal emission from hot dust , and optically veiled photospheric emission are the most likely causes .",
    "an apparent mass - age correlation ( for ages @xmath12  myr ) is observed for the thermal radio sources in ngc  4449 .",
    "the mid - infrared ( 24  @xmath1 m ) morphology of ngc  4449 is almost identical to that of the radio , indicating that nearly all of the warm dust in the galaxy is associated with the most recent episodes of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "local processes such as supernovae and stellar winds are likely playing an important role in triggering the _ current _ bursts of star formation within ngc  4449 .    synthesizing high quality data",
    "sets across the electromagnetic spectrum has provided us with a unique and detailed view of the current star formation occurring within ngc  4449 .",
    "our findings would not have been possible without the _ combination _ of radio , optical , and infrared observations .",
    "the results presented here are the first of a larger program to study massive star clusters as they emerge from their birth material and transition from being visible in the radio to optical wavelength regimes .",

    "we have developed a new multi - wavelength photometry code ( surphot ) to measure flux densities within identical _ irregular _ apertures in multiple images .",
    "surphot is written in the interactive data language ( idl ) and the basic algorithm is as follows : the user supplies a reference image and selects an aperture type , including `` contour '' or `` free - form '' ( in addition to a circle or an ellipse ) .",
    "if a contour aperture is chosen , surphot will detect a specified contour level to define a region of interest .",
    "alternatively , the user can choose to draw a free - form aperture by clicking around a region of interest .",
    "once an aperture is defined in the reference image , a background annulus is assigned by expanding the aperture out radially by two specified factors , matching the overall shape of the aperture .",
    "the pixel coordinates of vertices in the aperture and background annulus are transformed into right ascension and declination using astrometry keywords in the fits header of the reference image .",
    "the ra and dec values can then be transformed into pixel coordinates of any other image using its own fits header astrometry keywords . in this way",
    ", surphot uses the same aperture and background annulus to compute flux densities in any number of user supplied images , provided they are registered to match the astrometric reference frame of the reference image .    for a given source ,",
    "4 background levels and their errors are estimated in each image from which the user can choose : mode , mean , resistant mean and low mean .",

    "the low mean is found by using meanclip ( also found in the idl astronomy user s library ) to compute a @xmath15 clipped mean of the 25% lowest valued pixels in the background annulus .",
    "in general , the mode is our preferred estimate of the background level , however , the other estimates can provide a consistency check or an alternative value if appropriate . the estimated background value ( per pixel ) is multiplied by the number of pixels in the aperture and then subtracted from the sum of the pixels in the aperture to obtain the total background subtracted source counts . in the case of the vla images , the image units of jy beam@xmath10 are first converted to jy pix@xmath10 , where the conversion factor is given by the pixel area of the 2-d gaussian beam . the background subtracted flux density ( in jy )",

    "error estimates include contributions from three sources : poisson noise from the source counts , poisson noise from the background counts , and the error in measuring the background level .",
    "these error terms are calculated in units of electrons , added in quadrature and converted back to counts using the gain .",
