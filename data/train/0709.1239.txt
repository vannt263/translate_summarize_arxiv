    "applications of the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) to few - nucleon systems have been of great interest in the last decade . for reviews ,",

    "@xcite . particularly , a comprehensive review for the @xmath6 production is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the electroweak processes in ref .",
    "a powerful aspect of @xmath0pt is that it provides us with a bridge between different reactions in a model - independent way .",
    "this means that coupling constants ( the so - called low - energy constants , lecs ) fixed using experimental data for one of the reactions can then be used in the other .",
    "an interesting interaction in this context is @xmath7 with @xmath8 the spin operator is @xmath9 , and the external vector ( axial ) current is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is a lec .",
    "this contact interaction between the nucleons contributes to the three - nucleon force@xcite , the @xmath1-wave @xmath6-production ( @xmath2@xcite , @xmath13 ) , the radiative pion capture on the deuteron ( @xmath14)@xcite , and the weak processes in few - nucleon systems , such as tritium @xmath15-decay and the proton - proton fusion ( @xmath3)@xcite , the neutrino - induced disintegration of the deuteron ( @xmath16 , @xmath17)@xcite , and the muon capture by the deuteron ( @xmath18)@xcite . the contact term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:])d - term makes the connection among these reactions , which may be referred to as the two - body analog of the goldberger - treiman relation , as stated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if all couplings except for @xmath12 have been fixed using experimental data for @xmath19 and @xmath4 elastic scattering , then one can fix @xmath12 using one of the above reactions , and predict the others . there have been several such calculations which i will refer to as the `` bridging program '' .",
    "one of them was done by park _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where they fixed @xmath12 using the experimental tritium @xmath15-decay rate , and calculated , with no free parameters , the weak proton capture by a proton ( or @xmath20he ) . in this case , all the reactions are low - energy weak processes , and the kinematics are relatively similar .",
    "therefore , the bridging program is expected to work well . in another work due to hanhart _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the authors calculated the partial wave amplitude for the @xmath1-wave @xmath6-production ( @xmath2 ) , and showed that the use of @xmath12 fixed by three - nucleon observables  @xcite also consistently reproduces the partial wave amplitude extracted from experimental data  @xcite .",
    "although this result seems to be satisfactory , the bridging program in this work was not done fully consistently .",
    "this is because they used a nuclear force  @xcite which is different from the nuclear force used for fixing @xmath12 in ref .",
    "because of the short - range nature of the @xmath12 term , the @xmath12 value is largely dependent on the choice of the nuclear force .",
    "et al . _ also showed that the @xmath1-wave @xmath6-production amplitude is rather largely dependent on the contribution from the @xmath12 term .",
    "this indicates the importance of careful treatment of the @xmath12 term in the calculation ; the nuclear force and the @xmath12 value have to be consistent .",
    "finally , i mention the bridging program done by grdestig _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where they fixed the @xmath12 value using the matrix element of @xmath3 and then used it in calculating observables for @xmath21 .",
    "the two reactions are similar in kinematics of the @xmath4 sector , but are rather different in the momentum transfer , which might have to be taken care of .",
    "they are interested in extracting the neutron - neutron scattering length from the @xmath21 reaction and , for that purpose , they are interested in the shape of the spectrum rather than the absolute value .",
    "they found that the use of the @xmath12 term fixed in the above manner significantly reduces the dependence of the shape on @xmath22 which is the matching point between the long range one - pion - exchange potential and the short range square well potential .",
    "although this result is a success of the bridging program , it is still interesting to study the absolute value of the cross section in order to more rigorously test the power of @xmath0pt .    in this work ,",
    "i would like to more seriously investigate how reliably the bridging program , an important aspect of @xmath0pt , works .",
    "i believe that my investigation is important because there has been sometimes an argument which supposes that the bridging program works , even though it has not been quantitatively confirmed that a bridging program over reactions with considerably different kinematics works . for this purpose ,",
    "i calculate the partial wave amplitude for the @xmath1-wave @xmath6-production in @xmath4 collision ( @xmath2 ) , with @xmath12 fixed by an observable of a low - energy weak process .",

    "perturbatively and do not fully take account of some non - perturbative effect of the @xmath23 in wave functions .",
    "a calculation with a fuller account of the @xmath23 might be worthwhile doing to see a difference . ]",

    "[ sec_di ] that the @xmath12 value should be the same in the both cases , up to the order i am working . ]",
    "it is very interesting to see whether the operator constructed using the low - energy weak process can reasonably describe the @xmath6 production .",
    "i will use several combinations of the inputs ( the @xmath5 coupling , the @xmath4 potential , cutoff ) in my calculation . even though the @xmath12 value is fixed for each combination of the inputs so that the low - energy weak process is reproduced",
    ", one may expect a dependence of the @xmath6 production amplitude on the combination because of the rather different kinematics between the two reactions .",
    "i will study such a dependence .",
    "in fact , we will see that this bridging program is not successful when working with the nlo operators ; the partial wave amplitude of the @xmath6 production based on @xmath0pt is not consistent with the data .",
    "i will argue the importance of going to a higher order calculation . in order",

    "i used several different sets of the inputs such as the @xmath4 potential , @xmath43 and @xmath115 .",
    "even though there is some dependence of @xmath111 on these inputs , all results differ from the data in the similar manner .",
    "unfortunately , even the sign of @xmath117 , fixed by the weak process , is sometimes not consistent with the data .",
    "this result indicates that the bridging program between the two reactions with quite different kinematics is not always successful . in the literature",
    ", we have sometimes found an argument which supposes that the bridging program works .",
    "given the result here , it is clear that we need to seriously study a feasibility of the bridging program , particularly for reactions with different kinematics .",
    "this conclusion may be disappointing , but still understandable if we recall the success of the chiral nuclear force .",
    "the chiral nuclear force accurately describes the @xmath4 scattering over a wide energy region , partly because the lecs included have been fixed using data from the same energy region .",
    "in fact , there are several reasons to expect a higher order calculation to significantly improve the situation .",
    "first of all , one may naively think that the nlo , tree level , operator is too simple to describe the @xmath6 production .",
    "we know that two - pion - exchange mechanism and higher order contact terms are necessary for accurately describing the @xmath4 elastic scattering near the @xmath6 production threshold .",
    "second , the @xmath117 term largely contributes to @xmath111 , and therefore it would be important to extract the tpe mechanism from the @xmath117 term , thereby describing the intermediate - range mechanism more elaborately and reducing the role of the @xmath117 term .",
    "third , @xmath111 is considerably dependent on the choice of the @xmath4 potential , which means that the single contact term is too simple to cancel out different short distance physics for different @xmath4 potentials .",
    "i also argued that a substantial part of the @xmath4-dependence ( and @xmath43-dependence ) of @xmath111 is likely to be ascribable to the fact that the @xmath117 term alone is too simple to simulate the operator _ to be simulated_. meanwhile , a higher order calculation is also desirable to see the convergence of the chiral expansion ; regarding the @xmath2 reaction , we found no sign of the convergence up to this order .    in order to explore , even roughly , a result of a higher order calculation , i added a higher order counter term , with the lec @xmath118 , to the nlo operator .",
    "i fitted the lecs @xmath117 and @xmath118 to both the gamow - teller amplitude for the low - energy weak process and @xmath111 for the @xmath6 production .",
    "i found a set of the lecs with the natural strength .",
    "the lecs are mostly independent of the choice of @xmath43 as they should ; without the @xmath118 term , however , @xmath117 is rather dependent on @xmath43 . with this parameter",
    "set , @xmath114-dependence of @xmath111 is described in a way consistent with experimental data , irrespective of the choices of the @xmath4 potential , @xmath43 and @xmath115 .",
    "this result would be an indication that a higher order calculation is promising .",
    "i found that the single @xmath117 term is not always a good approximation of the @xmath117 plus @xmath118 terms .",
    "i also showed using the rg analysis that the contact operators with different cutoff are not always equivalent .",
    "these findings tell us to be careful about the convergence of the chiral expansion , and also the importance of going to a higher order calculation .",
    "i acknowledge b. k. jennings for reading the manuscript and comments .",
    "i also thank c. hanhart and d. r. phillips for useful discussions .",
