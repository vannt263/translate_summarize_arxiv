    "many problems in physics and chemistry are related to random walks on fractal structures @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that such structures are able to mimic the inhomogeneity and scale - invariance typical of disordered materials .",
    "an important class of fractal structures is given by the so called exactly decimable fractals which include deterministic finitely ramified fractals such as the sierpinski gasket and the t - graph .",
    "these structures , being amenable to renormalization procedures , allow exact analytic calculations @xcite .    in general , the lack of translational invariance implies significant corrections to the standard laws describing diffusion on regular lattices .",
    "indeed , in the fields of reaction - diffusion and transport theory , a question of longstanding interest concerns the interplay between spatial extent and system dimensionality in affecting the reaction kinetics and the transport efficiency @xcite .",
    "+ a fundamental quantity characterizing diffusion is the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , i.e. the expected time for a random walker , starting with equal probability at any site @xmath4 , to first reach a given site @xmath1 .",
    "this problem was first set up by montroll @xcite in the case of regular structures and later extended to more complex substrates @xcite .",
    "notice that this definition of mfpt involves a double average : the first one is over all the walks from a given origin @xmath5 , then you must average over a uniform distribution of initial sites , whose support is the whole set of graph sites , except @xmath1 .",
    "+ the mean first - passage time is also intrinsically related to a number of different problems @xcite . in the context of reaction - diffusion",
    "processes it represents the mean time to react for a particle diffusing in the presence of an active site located in @xmath1 @xcite , which is sometimes referred to as target problem .",
    "not only : the mean first - passage time defined above also describes the asymptotic behaviour of the average time for two diffusive particles to first encounter @xcite .",
    "the mfpt has been previously studied on different kinds of structures and several analytical results have been found .",
    "most of them consists of scaling relations and asymptotic behaviours @xcite , while a very few exact results are known @xcite .",
    "exact solutions on finite structures are especially longed for since they prove useful for a deeper comprehension of theoretical models and for checking approximate solutions or numerical simulations .",

    "the next generation is obtained by performing the operation illustrated in the bottom on each bond.,title=\"fig : \" ]    here , we derive the exact mean first - passage time for a random walker on the t - fractal , following the decimation procedure recently introduced by kozak et al . and applied to the sierpinski gasket @xcite . in particular , we assume a simple random walker ( rw ) in the presence of a perfect trap fixed at the central site and we calculate the mean - walk length before absorption . the closed - form expression we obtain for the latter , is akin to the one in @xcite and consistent with known asymptotic results @xcite .",
    "+ though they are both deterministic fractals , the sierpinski gasket and the t - fractal display significant differences : while the former models self - similar structures endowed with closed loops , the t - fractal is representative for tree - like structures and bundled structures in general @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is worth extending and comparing the related results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we describe the main features of the t - graph and we resume the analytic background underlying the analytic solution ; in sec .  [ sec : res ] we describe the decimation procedure applied and we obtain the exact formula for the mean first - passage time as a function of both the generation and the volume of the structure ; finally sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] includes conclusions and comments .",
    "a generic graph @xmath7 is mathematically specified by the pair @xmath8 consisting of a non - empty , countable set of points , @xmath9 joined pairwise by a set of links @xmath10 . the cardinality of @xmath9 is given by @xmath11 representing the number of sites making up the graph , i.e. its volume . from an algebraic point of view , a graph @xmath12 is completely described by its adjacency matrix @xmath13 .",
    "every entry of this off - diagonal , symmetric matrix corresponds to a pair of sites , and it equals one if and only if this couple is joined by a link , otherwise it is zero .",
    "the number of nearest - neighbours of the generic site @xmath5 , referred to as coordination number , can be recovered as a sum of adjacency matrix elements : @xmath14 .",
    "these are used to build up the diagonal matrix @xmath15 @xcite . + a very special class of graphs is given by the so called _ exactly decimable fractals _ which are geometrically invariant under site decimation . in general , all deterministic , finitely ramified fractals are exactly decimable .",
    "the solution of both the random walk and harmonic oscillations problems can be obtained by standard renormalization group calculations based on real space decimation procedures @xcite .",
    "the sierpinski gasket , the t - graph ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tfractal ] ) , the branched koch curves are examples of exactly decimable fractals , which accounts for their popularity .",
    "notice that such structures are characterized by strong restrictions on their topology which can give rise to properties far from holding for all fractals @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider a t - fractal which is iteratively constructed by performing the operation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfractal ] on each link .",
    "the number of iterations is called the generation @xmath2 of the fractal . at the @xmath2-th generation",
    "the cardinality of the set of nodes @xmath16 , hereafter called volume , is given by : @xmath17 .",
    "the t - fractal has fractal dimension @xmath18 and spectral dimension @xmath19 we recall that the former gives the dependence of the volume of the system on its linear size @xmath20 : @xmath21 ^{d_f } = ( 2^g)^{d_f},\\ ] ] while the latter governs ( among other phenomena ) the long - time properties of diffusion on the graph .",
    "indeed , if we consider a random walker starting from a given site @xmath5 of the graph , the probability @xmath22 of returning back to the starting point at time @xmath23 , at long times , follows the law @xmath24 when @xmath25 the random walker is said to perform a `` compact exploration '' of the space @xcite since the fractal dimension of its trajectory is greater than the dimension @xmath26 of the substrate .",
    "it is worth underlining that the t - fractal is irregular , that is the coordination number is site dependent .",
    "we can distinguish among `` internal site '' with coordination number @xmath27 and `` external site '' with @xmath28 .",

    "dotted links belong to @xmath36 and colored sites to @xmath37 ; more precisely , pink sites are in @xmath38 and blue sites in @xmath39 ]    .    figure [ fig : color ] shows generations @xmath40 and the labelling method adopted , which will be useful in the next section . in each new generation , we label only the new sites while old sites keep their own labels . hence ,",
    "at generation @xmath41 we name new sites progressively , starting from @xmath42 .",
    "the first sites to be labelled are the innermost , the last ones are those farthest from the central site @xmath43 . at each generation",
    "we can distinguish sets of equivalent sites which are labelled anti - clock wise .",
    "due to the symmetry of the t - graph , the cardinality of such sets is always a multiple of @xmath33 ; for example we have @xmath44 .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us resume some facts concerning unbiased diffusion on a t - fractal of generation @xmath2 represented by the adjacency matrix @xmath45 ( henceforth we will omit the subscript @xmath2 ) . we consider a simple rw , starting , at @xmath46 , from site @xmath5 ; at each time step ( taken to be unity ) the particle jumps with equal probability to any of its nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "being @xmath47 the probability of going from @xmath5 to @xmath48 in @xmath23 steps , the following master equation holds : @xmath49 which states that at each time step , the jumping probability from an internal site is @xmath50 . from the previous equation",
    "it follows that @xmath51_{ji}$ ] .",
    "it is also easy to verify that the markov chain representing such a random walk is ergodic and the particle will visit all sites with probability @xmath52 , independently of the origin @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the walker will reach any site with probability @xmath52 , in a time possibly diverging when @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider a perfectly absorbing trap , fixed on the central site ( labelled with index @xmath54 ) of the t - graph .",
    "our aim is to obtain , through a decimation procedure , an exact , closed - form solution for the average time to absorption , where the average is meant both over all the possible walks starting from the same origin @xmath5 and over all sites @xmath4 taken as origin of the walk .",
    "+ the special choice we made for the trap location makes the decimation procedure easier to be applied as we can identify the site @xmath1 since the first generation .",
    "we now introduce @xmath55 to be the @xmath56-th ( @xmath57 ) moment of the trapping time for a walk starting from @xmath5 on the @xmath2-th generation of the graph . obviously , regardless of @xmath2 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is the zero - th moment of the distribution of the time to absorption given @xmath5 as origin and it is unitary because the walker will be trapped with probability @xmath52 , whatever its origin .",
    "the starting point for our analytic treatment is the discrete differential equation introduced in @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a normalized version of the discrete laplacian whose first row and column ( corresponding to the trap site ) have been removed .",
    "we recall that @xmath62 is a nonsingular matrix and each row has sum zero , apart from those corresponding to sites @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. the three nearest - neighbours of the trap , for which the sum is @xmath66 . as discussed in @xcite , eq .  [ eq : koz ] can be generalized to the case of two or more particles simultaneously diffusing .    in the following ,",
    "we just focus on the set of first moments @xmath67 , for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : koz ] ) simplifies into @xmath68 henceforth we can drop the index corresponding to @xmath56 without ambiguity : @xmath69 now , we implement the average over the starting site @xmath5 , chosen according to a uniform distribution in @xmath70 : @xmath71 in the next section we derive some recurrence relations which allow to simplify the previous equation .    equation [ eq : tau_av ] can be very easily interpreted if we look at the random walk as a markov chain .",
    "indeed , @xmath72 is just the fundamental matrix for the process , whose entry @xmath73 represents , by definition , the expected number of times that the process is in the transient state @xmath48 , being started in the transient state @xmath5 .",
    "finally , notice that , due to the symmetry and the absence of loops characterizing the structure under consideration , the mean time to absorption found in this case just corresponds to the mean time to reach either site @xmath74 on a t - fractal of generation @xmath75 .",
    "otherwise stated , if we call @xmath76 the mean time to first reach site @xmath32 ( or , analogously , @xmath77 ) , then @xmath78 .",
    "the number of terms to sum up in eq .",
    "[ eq : tau_av ] grows exponentially with @xmath2 , hence , a direct calculation of @xmath79 and @xmath0 can be accomplished straightforwardly only for the very first generations ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : values_2 ] and [ tab : values_1 ] ) .",
    "such data allow to get some recurrence relations useful for the derivation of the final formula .",
    "first of all , notice that for a given site @xmath5 , we have @xmath80 : in each generation the chemical distance from @xmath5 to the trap doubles while the mean time to first reach the trap increases by a factor @xmath81 .",
    "this exact scaling follows from the symmetry and decimability of the graph and it is consistent with the random walk dimension on the t - fractal : @xmath82 @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is also possible to obtain an expression for @xmath83 as a function of the volume @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , recalling the spectral dimension for the t - graph , we can write @xmath85 , and @xmath86.\\ ] ] notice that the last expression gives the exact , explicit dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath16 . in the asymptotic limit , as @xmath16 diverges , @xmath87 this result is consistent with the leading behaviour of @xmath0 on the t - fractal discussed in @xcite and , more generally , to the leading behaviour of the trapping time on low dimensional ( @xmath25 ) structures .",
    "in fact , as already remarked , the mfpt represents the mean trapping time @xmath88 for a diffusing particle in the presence of a fixed perfect trap ( or , symmetrically , the trapping time for an immobile target in the presence of a diffusive trap ) .",
    "being @xmath89 the survival probability at the @xmath23-th step @xmath89 , i.e. the probability that the rw has not yet reached the trap site , then @xcite : @xmath90 the asymptotic expression for the survival probability is @xcite : @xmath91,\\ ] ] with @xmath92 one therefore expects that , for low dimensional structures , @xmath93 .",
    "our result and the one in @xcite establish this relationship rigorously .    as can be shown by scaling arguments , on long times , the factor @xmath94 , which is the leading term in eqs .",
    "[ eq : recurrence6 ] , [ eq : abstime_t2 ] , is involved in all the dynamical properties of diffusion on the t - fractal .",
    "for example , the characteristic time in the exponential decay of the survival probability increases with the generation of the tree as @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "( color on line ) mean first - passage time for a simple random walker moving on a t - fractal ( black stars ) and on a sierpinski gasket ( red circles ) as a function of the volume @xmath96 ( the volume the rw can actually span before being trapped ) , according to exact analytic solutions . ]",
    "equation [ eq : abstime_t2 ] is also consistent with a recent result obtained by condamin et al .",
    "@xcite who found the asymptotic ( large @xmath3 ) expression for the average time @xmath97 taken by a rw on a generic scale - invariant structure to first reach a trap distant @xmath98 from the starting point . in particular , for compact exploration ( @xmath99 ) , @xmath100",
    ". thus , if we fix the trap on a particular site @xmath1 , we can obtain an estimate for the mfpt , by simply averaging over all possible distances @xmath98 from @xmath1 . for the t - fractal considered here , @xmath54",
    "and we can write : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of sites distant @xmath98 from @xmath1 and @xmath103 is the largest distance from the central site . under the above mentioned assumption of large volume",
    ", we can adopt a continuous picture and @xmath104 ; by integrating the previous expression , we get @xmath105 , as expected .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] we compare eq .  [ eq : recurrence5 ] with the analogous formula found for the sierpinski gasket ( @xmath106 ) in @xcite : @xmath107.\\ ] ] in the asymptotic limit , @xmath0 diverges faster for the t - fractal .",
    "this can be trivially drawn algebraically while , from a topological point of view , it evidences the role of loops in reducing the average distance between two random sites , making the diffusive particles survive shorter .",
    "in this work we study the mean first - passage time @xmath0 for a random walker on a t - fractal .",
    "the latter , being exactly decimable , allows the use of the powerful technique of exact renormalization .",
    "we find an exact , closed - form solution for @xmath0 as a function of either the generation @xmath2 and the volume @xmath16 .",
    "the leading term of @xmath0 is consistent with known asymptotic results .",
    "it should be underlined that an exact solution on a finite system is generally very useful in order to understand more quantitatively the asymptotic limit .",
    "our findings are interesting also in the light of a recent result concerning the survival probability for the trapping problem @xmath108 , with both species , @xmath13 and @xmath109 , diffusing @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that on low - dimensional structures ( @xmath110 ) the survival probability for an a particle asymptotically does not depend on its diffusivity constant @xmath111 .",
    "otherwise stated , at long times , the target problem and the trapping problem provides the same results .",
    "hence , exact results concerning the target problem , also provide the correct asymptotic behaviour for the trapping problem with diffusive traps .",
