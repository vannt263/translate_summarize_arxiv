    "the mathematical research presented here is motivated by problems of theoretical distributed computing .",
    "even though , the computer science background is , strictly speaking , not necessary to read the definitions and the proofs in this paper , we feel it is beneficial to review the broader context , before delving into the description of our results .",
    "the reader who is only interested in the mathematical part , may skip our explanations , and proceed directly to section  [ sect:3 ] at this point .    in theoretical distributed computing one studies solvability of standard tasks under various computational models .",
    "the computational model which we consider here is the following .",
    "we have @xmath0 _ asynchronous _ processes , which communicate with each other using the read / write shared memory , which in turn consists of atomic registers assigned to individual processes .",
    "the operations allowed for each process are _ write _ and _ snapshot read_. the operation _",
    "write _ writes whatever value the process wants into its register in the shared memory .",
    "the operation _ snapshot read _ reads the entire shared memory atomically .",
    "each process executes a  wait - free protocol ; with crash failures allowed . a  _ crash failure _ means that the process which failed simply stops executing its protocol , rather than , say , sending the wrong information .",
    "the protocol is called _ wait - free _ ,",
    "if , intuitively speaking , the processes are not allowed to _ wait _ for each other , i.e. , to make their executions contingent on hearing from other processes . in practical terms , this means that when a  process @xmath1 did not hear from the process @xmath2 for a  while , and now needs to decide on an  output value , its decision must be such that the total produced output will be valid , no matter whether the process @xmath2 crashed , or whether it will suddenly revive its execution once @xmath1 has chosen its output .",
    "due to asynchrony , the process @xmath1 can not distinguish between these two options at this point of the execution .    for brevity",
    ", we refer to this entire computational model as _ read / write wait - free _ model .",
    "there is a  large class of computational models , which have been proved to be equivalent to each other . since this class includes the read / write wait - free model , all the statements pertaining to solvability of certain tasks proved for this model are actually quite general , and say something about the entire subject of wait - free asynchronous computation .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for further background .",
    "once the computational model is fixed , it becomes interesting to understand which tasks are solvable in this model . to gain structural insight ,",
    "one concentrates on the questions of solvability of the so - called _",
    "standard tasks_. the standard task which is central to this paper is the so - called _ weak symmetry breaking task _ , which will be abbreviated to wsb . in this task ,",
    "the processes have no input values , just their i d s .",
    "their output values are  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 .",
    "the task is solvable if there exists an read / write wait - free protocol such that in every execution in which all processes decide on an output value , not all processes decide on the same one .",
    "in addition , this protocol is required to be _ rank - symmetric _ in the sense which we now describe .",
    "let @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 be the  order - preserving bijection .",
    "assume @xmath8 is an execution of the protocol , in which the set of participating processes is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is an execution of the protocol , in which the set of participating processes is @xmath11 .",
    "then , the protocol is called rank - symmetric if for every @xmath12 , the process with i d  @xmath13 must decide on the same value as the process with i d  @xmath14",
    ". the protocol will certainly be rank - symmetric , if each process only compares its i d to the i d s of the other participating processes , and makes the final decision based on the relative rank of its  i d .",
    "another important task is _ renaming_. the renaming task , see  @xcite , is defined as follows : the @xmath0 processes here have unique input names , taken from some large universe of inputs , and need to decide on unique output names from the set @xmath15 .",
    "the processes also have process i d s labeled @xmath16 , and it is requested for the protocol to be _",
    "anonymous_. the protocol is called anonymous if its execution does not depend on the process i d , only the process input value , and whatever information the process receives during the execution . in other words ,",
    "two different processes should decide on an identical output value if they receive same inputs and same information from the outside world , even though they will have different  i d s .",
    "it has been proved that for @xmath0 processes the wsb is equivalent to @xmath17-renaming in the read / write wait - free model .",
    "so deciding whether wsb is solvable will also tell us whether @xmath17-renaming for @xmath0 processes is solvable .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further information on the renaming task .",
    "@xmath18    at present time , the solvability of wsb in the read / write wait - free model is completely understood . for some time",
    ", it was believed that wsb is not solvable for any number of processes , however , this turned out to be incorrect . the correct answer is :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ weak symmetry breaking for @xmath0 processes is solvable in read / write wait - free model if and only if @xmath0 is not a  prime power . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    while impossibility of wsb when @xmath0 is a  prime power has been known for a  while , the solvability of wsb when @xmath0 is _ not _ a  prime power ( the smallest example here is clearly when we have @xmath19 processes ) has involved a  few turns in the literature .",
    "the final point in the matter was put by castaeda & rajsbaum , @xcite , see also @xcite for the prehistory .",
    "the important and interesting paper of castaeda & rajsbaum serves as a  motivation and the entry point for the research presented in this article .",
    "we recommend that the reader acquaints himself with the contents of  @xcite .",
    "there is a  way of reducing the computability of wsb in read / write wait - free model to a  purely mathematical existence question .",
    "it involves the anonymous computability theorem of herlihy & shavit , @xcite , so its complete description would be too technical for the current presentation .",
    "therefore , for the sake of brevity , we opt to confine ourselves to presenting a  mathematical formulation directly , and then refering the reader , who is interested in the better understanding of the connection between distributed computing and the topological context to the above mentioned work of castaeda & rajsbaum , @xcite , as well as to  @xcite . the necessary background in combinatorial topology can be found in  @xcite , while more on the topology of protocol complexes can be found in  @xcite . in the remainder of this section",
    "we give an equivalent reformulation of the solvability of wsb in read / write wait - free model in terms of simplicial subdivisions .",
    "@xmath18    first , we introduce some terminology .",
    "we let @xmath20 $ ] denote the set @xmath21 , in particular , @xmath22=\\{0,1\\}$ ] will denote the set of boolean values . for a boolean value @xmath23 we let @xmath24 denote the negation of  @xmath23 . for every @xmath25 we let @xmath26 denote the so - called standard @xmath27-simplex .",
    "this is a  geometric simplicial complex , which has a  unique @xmath27-simplex , spanned by the unit coordinate vectors in @xmath28 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath26 are indexed by the elements of the set @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "more generally , the @xmath29-dimensional boundary simplices of @xmath26 are indexed by the subsets @xmath30 $ ] , such that @xmath31 ; we shall denote such a boundary simplex @xmath32 and identify its set of vertices with  @xmath33 .",
    "for every two subsets @xmath34 $ ] , such that @xmath35 , there exists a  unique order - preserving bijection @xmath36 .",
    "this order - preserving bijection induces a  linear isomorphism @xmath37 .",
    "a  finite geometric simplicial complex @xmath38 is called a  _ subdivison _ of @xmath26 if every simplex of @xmath38 is contained in a  simplex of @xmath26 , and every simplex of @xmath26 is the union of those simplices of @xmath38 which it contains .",
    "clearly , for every @xmath30 $ ] , we have an induced subdivision @xmath39 . for each simplex @xmath40 , we let @xmath41 denote the unique simplex @xmath42 of @xmath26 such that the interior of @xmath43 is contained in the interior of  @xmath42 . finally , for an arbitrary simplicial complex @xmath44 , we let @xmath45 denote the set of vertices of  @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath18    the next definition is crucial for the simplicial approach to the rank - symmetric protocols .",
    "a subdivision @xmath38 of the standard @xmath27-simplex @xmath26 is called * hereditary * if for all @xmath34 $ ] such that @xmath35 , the linear isomorphism @xmath46 is also an isomorphism of the subdivision restrictions @xmath39 and @xmath47 .",

    "in general , if all vertices of an  @xmath27-simplex @xmath40 get the same label under @xmath57 , one calls @xmath43 _ monochromatic _ , so the surjectivity condition is equivalent to saying that there are no monochromatic @xmath27-simplices under  @xmath57 .",
    "we shall also talk of @xmath3-monochromatic and @xmath4-monochromatic @xmath27-simplices when we need to specify the label assigned to the vertices of  @xmath43 .",

    "this settles the solvability of wsb in read / write wait - free model when the number of processes is not a  prime power .",
    "the idea of the proof of castaeda & rajsbaum is as follows :    * start with some @xmath38 and some labeling @xmath57 , which may have monochromatic simplices ; * connect the monochromatic simplices if possible by simplicial paths of even lengths ; * subdivide each path further , so as to eliminate the two monochromatic end @xmath27-simplices .",
