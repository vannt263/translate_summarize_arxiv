    "in a quantum measurement , observable information in the measured system can be extracted from the statistical average shift of a pointer . in this process , von neumann interaction is initially used with the standard model of quantum measurement by mathematically describing the coupling between the measured system and measuring devices @xcite . however , such strong measurements are not time symmetric . when considering time - symmetric quantum measurements , post - selection of the measured system is required after the measurement interaction @xcite .",
    "on summing the post - selections , the statistical average shift of the pointer can be determined in the standard model of quantum measurement .",
    "therefore , throughout the present work , measurements with post - selection are called post - selected von neumann quantum measurements . a particular case of post - selected von neumann quantum measurements with sufficiently weak coupling between the measuring device and measured system",
    "is called the weak measurement , as proposed by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite .",
    "this statistical average shift of the pointer is characterized by the weak value of the observable in the measured system @xcite .",
    "a significant feature of the weak measurements is that the weak value of the measured quantity can lie outside the usual range of eigenvalues of an observable applicable for a standard quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "this feature is usually referred to as the amplification effect for weak signals and is different from conventional quantum measurement , in which a coherent superposition of quantum states is collapsed @xcite .",
    "a large weak value can amplify small unknown parameters for detecting various properties such as beam deflection @xcite , frequency shifts @xcite , phase shifts @xcite , angular shifts @xcite , velocity shifts @xcite , and even temperature shifts @xcite .",
    "however , the advantages of the weak - value amplification are purely technical @xcite .",
    "this is based on the single parameter estimation theory . in general , the weak value is a complex number .",
    "thus , weak measurements are ideal for examining the fundamentals of quantum physics such as quantum paradoxes ( hardy s paradox @xcite and the three - box paradox @xcite ) , quantum correlation and quantum dynamics @xcite , and quantum - state tomography @xcite , as well as the violation of the generalized leggett",
    " garg inequalities @xcite and the violation of the initial heisenberg measurement  disturbance relationship @xcite .    thus far",
    ", most studies on weak measurement use the zero - mean gaussian state as an initial pointer state and expand the unitary operator of evolution up to the first order because , in the weak measurement scheme , the coupling between the measured system and measuring device is very weak .",
    "however , when considering the connection between weak and strong measurements , amplification limit , and measurement back - action of the weak measurement scheme , the full - order effects of unitary evolution due to the von neumann interaction between the measured system and measuring device are required .",
    "the measurements of arbitrary coupling strength beyond the first - order interaction have been previously discussed by aharonov and botero @xcite .",
    "di lorenzo and egues @xcite investigated von neumann - type measurement to clarify detector dynamics in the weak - measurement process .",
    "wu and li @xcite proposed a general formulation of weak measurement that includes second - order effects of the unitary evolution due to the von neumann interaction between the system and detector , and they theoretically demonstrated on the basis of the second - order calculation that the back - action effect is important in the weak - value amplification . recently",
    ", several studies @xcite analytically showed that an upper bound of the weak - value amplification exists in the post - selected von neumann measurement by assuming that the probe - state wave function is gaussian and that the observable @xmath0 satisfies @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is the identity operator . on the other hand",
    ", there is no upper bound on the weak - value amplification on the optimal probe - state wave function  @xcite while it is so difficult to implement this wave function  @xcite .    in optical experiments , we encounter higher - order gaussian beams such as hermite ",
    "gaussian ( hg ) and laguerre  gaussian ( lg ) beams , which are higher - order solutions of the paraxial wave equation with rectangular and cylindrical symmetry about their axes of propagation , respectively .",
    "both hg and lg beams are widely used in the theory of lasers and resonators @xcite .",
    "in fact , the zero - mean gaussian beam is a special case of hg and lg beams .",
    "the weak measurement with the higher - order gaussian - beam pointer state has been discussed in refs .",
    "in particular , de lima bernardo et al .",
    "@xcite presented a simplified algebraic description of the weak measurements with hg and lg pointer states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the unitary evolution operator is considered only up to the first order , raising an intriguing question as to whether the higher - order gaussian beams are more advantageous in quantum measurement compared to the fundamental gaussian beam .    in the present study",
    ", we determine the post - selected von neumann quantum measurement for an arbitrary coupling strength with hg- and lg - mode pointer states under the assumption that the system observable @xmath0 satisfies @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( projection operator ) .",
    "to clarify the practical advantages of higher - order gaussian beams , we investigate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) while considering the post - selection probability , which is defined by @xmath4 here , @xmath5 denotes the expectation value of the measuring system operator under the final state of the pointer , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the coupling direction of the von neumann measurement ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the orthogonal coupling direction ) . here , @xmath10 is the probability that the post - selected state is included in the pre - selection state , and @xmath11 is the number of measurement time . to verify our general formulas , two special limits",
    "are considered . if the zero - mean gaussian pointer is used as the initial state , our general expectation values are found to reduce to the results given in refs .",
