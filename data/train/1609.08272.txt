    "a group is a basic algebraic structure that comes from the study of polynomial equations by galois in 1830 . to describe the structure of a group , cayley introduced in 1878 @xcite the concept of graph for any group @xmath0 according to any generating subset @xmath1",
    "this is simply the set of labelled oriented edges @xmath2 for every @xmath3 of @xmath0 and @xmath4 of @xmath1 .",
    "such a graph , called cayley graph ( or cayley diagram ) , is directed and labelled in @xmath1 ( or an encoding of @xmath1 by symbols called letters or colors ) .",
    "a characterization of unlabelled and undirected cayley graphs was given by sabidussi in 1958 @xcite .",
    "these are the connected graphs whose automorphism group has a subgroup with a free and transitive action on the graph .",
    "so if one wants to know whether an unlabelled and undirected graph is a cayley graph , we must know if we can extract a subgroup of the automorphism group that allows to define a free and transitive action on the graph .",
    "to better understand the structure of cayley graphs , it is pertinent to look for characterizations by simple graph - theoretic conditions .",
    "this approach was clearly stated by hamkins in 2010 : which graphs are cayley graphs ? + every cayley graph is a graph with high symmetry : it is vertex - transitive meaning that the action of its automorphism group is transitive , or equivalently that all its vertices are isomorphic meaning that we ` see ' the same structure regardless of the vertex where we ` look ' .",
    "we can characterize the cayley graphs as vertex - transitive graphs . by definition ,",
    "any cayley graph satisfies three basic graph properties .",
    "first is is simple : there are no two arcs of the same source and goal .",
    "it is also deterministic : there are no two arcs of the same source and label .",
    "finally the identity element is a root . in this article",
    ", we show that these three conditions added to the condition of being vertex - transitive characterize exactly the cayley graphs .",
    "this improves sabidussi s characterization that easily can be adapted to directed and labelled graphs : the cayley graphs are the deterministic rooted simple graphs whose automorphism group has a subgroup with a free and transitive action on the graph . in other words",
    ", we reduce this last condition to the fact that the graph is vertex - transitive .",
    "for such a simplification , the key result is that every strongly connected , deterministic and co - deterministic graph is isomorphic to the canonical graph of any of its cycle languages .",
    "this is a fairly standard result in automata theory . +",
    "precisely an automaton is just a directed labelled graph ( finite or not ) with input and output vertices .",
    "it recognizes the language of the labels of paths from an input to an output vertex .",
    "any language @xmath5 is recognized by its canonical automaton , namely the automaton whose graph is the set of transitions between the ( left ) residuals of @xmath5 , having @xmath5 as its unique initial vertex , and the final vertices are the residuals of @xmath5 containing the empty word .",
    "we minimize an automaton by identifying its bisimilar vertices .",
    "any minimal deterministic and reduced automaton is isomorphic to the canonical automaton of its recognized language .",
    "moreover , any co - deterministic and reduced automaton is minimal .",
    "the previous key result follows from these last two properties : any deterministic and co - deterministic reduced automaton is isomorphic to the canonical automaton of its recognized language . + an equivalent characterization of cayley graphs is obtained by strengthening the condition of being rooted by the strong connectivity , and simplify the condition of being vertex - transitive by the fact that all vertices have the same elementary cycle language .",
    "finally , we consider the extension of cayley graphs for all non - empty subsets of groups . under the assumption of the axiom of choice ,",
    "we show that these graphs are exactly the deterministic , co - deterministic , vertex - transitive simple graphs .",
    "an automaton is just a directed labelled graph with input and output vertices .",
    "an accepting path is a path from an initial vertex to a final vertex .",
    "an automaton recognizes the language of accepting path labels .",
    "we recall the notions of minimal automaton of an automaton , and the notion of canonical automaton of a language . for any deterministic and reduced automaton ,",
    "its minimal automaton is isomorphic to the canonical automaton of its recognized language .",
    "moreover , any co - deterministic and co - accessible automaton is minimal .",
    "it follows that every strongly connected deterministic and co - deterministic graph is isomorphic to the canonical graph of the path language between any two vertices .",
    "we recall basic definitions for directed labelled graphs and automata .",
    "+ let @xmath6 be an arbitrary ( finite or infinite ) set of symbols .",
    "we consider a graph as a set of directed edges labelled in @xmath6 . a directed @xmath6-_graph _",
    "@xmath7 is defined by a set @xmath8 of _ vertices _ and a subset @xmath9 of _ edges_. any edge @xmath10 is from the _ source _ @xmath11 to the _ goal _ @xmath12 with _ label _",
