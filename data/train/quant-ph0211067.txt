    "non - separability , or entanglement , has emerged as one of the most striking feature of quantum mechanics . in 1935 , it led einstein , podolsky and rosen to suggest @xcite that quantum mechanics is incomplete , on the premise that any physical theory of nature must be both localand realistic . to quantify the debate between quantum mechanics and local realistic ( classical ) theories , bell introduced a set of inequalities that must be obeyed by any local realistic theory whereas they are violated by quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these results shifted the debate from the realm of philosophy to experimental physics .",
    "the experiments done at the beginning of the 1980s by aspect and coworkers @xcite convincingly supported the predictions of quantum mechanics , but admittedly left open two so - called  loopholes \" , that have to be addressed for the evidence to be fully conclusive .",
    "the first of these loopholes , called localityloophole , arises when the separation between the measured states is not large enough to completely discard the exchange of subluminal signals during the measurements .",
    "the second loophole , called detection - efficiencyloophole , occurs when the particle detectors are inefficient enough so that the detected events may be unrepresentative of the whole ensemble . in 1998 , zeilinger _",
    "@xcite achieved communication - free condition by using a type - ii parametric down - conversion source and fast random switching of the analyzers , that were separated by about 400 m .",
    "this closed the localityloophole , but their detection efficiency was not sufficient to close the second loophole . in 2001 , rowe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured quantum correlations between two entangled beryllium ions with up to 80% detection efficiency , closing the detection - efficiencyloophole , but unfortunately the ions were too close ( about @xmath0 ) to avoid the localityloophole .",
    "hence a present challenge is to design and perform an experiment that closes both loopholes to lead to a full logically consistent test of any local realistic theory .",
    "quantum optics suggests good candidates , as photons can be transported to sufficient long distances to avoid the localityloophole . to close the detection - efficiencyloophole , an alternative to photon - counting schemes",
    "consists in quadrature - phase homodyne measurements , that use strong local oscillators detected by highly efficient photodiodes .",
    "up to date , a few theoretical proposals that use quadrature - phase homodyne detections have been made @xcite but for these set - ups the bell inequality violation is a few percents only , that lies far away of the maximal violation attainable : @xmath1 ( compared to a classical maximum of 2 ) and @xmath2 ( compared to a classical maximum of 1 ) respectively for the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh)@xcite and clauser - horne ( ch)@xcite inequalities .",
    "@xcite use a _ circle _ or pair coherent state produced by non - degenerate parametric oscillation with the pump adiabatically removed .",
    "this state leads to a theoretical violation of about 1.015 ( @xmath3 ) of the ch bell inequality .",
    "munro @xcite considers correlated photon number states of the form @xmath4 is truncated at @xmath5 .",
    "he then performs a numerical optimization on each @xmath6 coefficient to maximize the violation of the chsh bell inequality when an homodyne measurement is performed . for this specific state , the chsh inequality",
    "is violated by 2.076 ( @xmath7 ) and the ch inequality by 1.019 ( @xmath3 ) . from a different phase space approach ,",
    "@xcite derive phase space bell inequalities and propose a state that yields a maximal violation of up to @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this state can be expressed in the position space by @xmath8f(|q_1|)f(|q_2|)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a regularized form of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "the main problem with this wave function lies in its singularities and phase switches .",
    "therefore , it requires nontrivial regularization procedures to be considered as a suitable physical state . following these various attempts",
    ", we are thus looking for a  simple \" physical state that would lead to a maximal violation of a bell inequality .        in this paper",
    ", we consider the clauser - horn - shimony - holt ( chsh ) bell inequality @xcite(sometimes referred to as the _ spin _ inequality ) .",
    "fig.[expsetup ] depicts an idealized setup for a general bell inequality measurement .",
    "two entangled sub - states are viewed by two analyzers and detectors at locations a and b , where a and b denote any adjustable parameter at a and b. in our particular case , we will use quadrature - phase homodyne measurements , which could have an efficiency high enough to close the detection - efficiencyloophole .",
    "moreover , the apparatuses a and b can be in principle spacelike separated , thereby excluding action at distance , and closing also the localityloophole .",
    "we point out that in the present approach all the detected light has to be taken into account , i.e. the relevant signal is the photocurrent generated by the interferometric mixing and photodetection of the local oscillator and input quantum state .",
    "therefore , no ",
    "supplementary assumption\"@xcite will be needed to interpret the data . under these conditions ,",
    "the chsh bell inequality can be written @xcite : @xmath12 where the correlation function @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14 with @xmath15 the probability that a + occurs at both a and b , given @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    in this article , we propose explicitly a set of physical states that yield a violation of the chsh inequality arbitrarily close to its maximum value , when measured by an ideal quadrature - phase homodyne detection . in section",
    "ii , we describe how we convert the continuous quadrature amplitude into a binary result + or -for each apparatus a , b using a process called _ root binning_. in section iii , a specific state that yields a large violation of the chsh inequality is presented .",
    "this state is generalized in section iv to derive a whole family of states that violate this bell inequality .",
    "the issue of preparing such states is addressed in section v , and various other theoretical and practical issues are briefly discussed in the conclusion .",
    "to begin our study , we consider a state of the form of a superposition of two two - particles wave functions with a relative phase .",
    "@xmath18 with @xmath19 real , even and normalized to unity while @xmath20 is assumed real , odd and normalized to unity .",
    "this kind of state looks similar to the one used by auberson _",
    "@xcite , but the @xmath19 and @xmath20 functions will be quite different as well as the binning of the continuous variables being measured .",
    "the quadrature - phase homodyne measurement outputs a continuous variable , and yet the majority of tests of local realism versus quantum mechanics require a binary result .",
    "hence for a given quadrature measurement @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) at either location a or b , we need to classify the result as either + or - . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the positive - negativebinning is used , that is the result is classified as + if @xmath23 and -if @xmath24 .",
    "the choice of binning is quite arbitrary . for the state ( [ oestate ] )",
    "we can consider another type of binning , we call _ root binning _ , that depends on the roots of the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( that are known in advance to the experimenters ) .",
    "we assign + when the result @xmath21 lies in an interval where @xmath9 and @xmath25 have the same sign , and -if @xmath21 is in an interval where @xmath19 and @xmath20 have opposite signs .",
    "we define @xmath26 as the union of the intervals in which @xmath9 and @xmath25 have the same sign and @xmath27 as the union of the intervals in which @xmath9 and @xmath25 have opposite signs .",
    "d^+= \\ {   q     |   f(q )   g(q )    0 } + d^-= \\ {   q     |  f(q )   g(q )  <  0 }    let us first consider the case when quadrature measurements in position space have been performed on both sides .",
    "so the binary probabilities we need for the chsh type of bell inequality will be    p_++=_d^+ _ d^+ dq_1 dq_2 p(q_1,q_2 ) + p_+-=_d^+ _",
    "d^- dq_1 dq_2 p(q_1,q_2 ) + p_-+=_d^- _",
    "d^+ dq_1dq_2 p(q_1,q_2 ) + p_=_d^- _",
    "d^- dq_1 dq_2 p(q_1,q_2 )    with @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hereafter , we calculate the correlation function for ( [ oestate ] ) : @xmath29 and as we have chosen @xmath19 even and @xmath20 odd , we get the remarkably simple expression : @xmath30 where @xmath31    a similar binning will be applied for the momentum part .",
    "since we suppose that @xmath9 is a real and even function while @xmath25 is real and odd , @xmath9 has a real even fourier transform @xmath32 while @xmath25 has an imaginary fourier transform @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a real and odd function . using these properties , and taking care of the supplementary @xmath35 factor",
    ", the same reasoning applies for @xmath36 and @xmath37 as for @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "denoting as @xmath38 and @xmath39 the intervals associated with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath40 where @xmath41 and equivalently , @xmath42 @xmath43 hence by combining eqs.([exx ] ) , ( [ epp ] ) , ( [ exp ] ) and ( [ epx ] ) we can write the chsh inequality ( [ ineq ] ) @xmath44 the maximum of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46 is obtained for @xmath47 , and we have @xmath48 as @xmath49 . for this optimized @xmath50",
    "we get the bell inequality @xmath51 using this really simple expression ( [ ineqeasy ] ) , the debate between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories boils down to find functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 whose integrals @xmath52 , @xmath53 violate ( [ ineqeasy ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature appears when the distributions are eigenstates of the fourier transform , so that @xmath54 and equation ( [ ineqeasy ] ) becomes @xmath55 so if such functions have the right overlap needed to obtain @xmath56 , one will get the maximal violation of the above inequality , which is obtained for @xmath57 .    when compared to the positive - negative binning , root binning has the advantage of having two parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 to play with while the positive - negative binning has only one @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we will show now , the above bell inequality is violated by simple wave functions , that no longer have the singularities that appeared in ref.@xcite .",
    "in order to propose an explicit expression of a state that violates the bell inequality ( [ ineqeasy ] ) , let us first consider the case of a schrdinger cat state .",
    "the schrdinger cats , that are a superposition of two coherent states of amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath58 , involve intrinsic quantum features such as negative wigner functions , which make them interesting candidates for our case ( [ oestate ] ) .",
    "we must choose an even cat for @xmath9 and an odd cat for @xmath25 :    f(q ) e^-(q+a)^2/2+e^-(q - a)^2/2 + g(q ) -e^-(q+a)^2/2+e^-(q - a)^2/2    unfortunately for this simple state we get @xmath56 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 .",
    "therefore this state can not be used for violating bell inequality ( note that gilchrist _",
    "@xcite also consider schrdinger cats , but without getting a violation of bell inequalities ) .    instead of schrdinger cats which can be alive or dead",
    ", we consider acrobat cats which have 4 paws .",
    "let us for instance consider :    [ f4 ] f(q)-e^-(q+3a)^2/2+e^-(q+a)^2/2+e^-(q - a)^2/2 +  -e^-(q-3a)^2/2 + g(q)-e^-(q+3a)^2/2-e^-(q+a)^2/2+e^-(q - a)^2/2 +  + e^-(q-3a)^2/2 [ g4 ]    @xmath9 and @xmath25 are depicted in fig.[4pfg ] together with their fourier transform .",
    "note that for this choice of functions , each peak is distant from its neighbours of @xmath62 , this disposition yields an optimal overlap of @xmath36 and @xmath63 and thus a high value of @xmath45 .",
    "the best violation appears when the peaks move off as @xmath60 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath64 and thus we get the significant violation of @xmath65 ( in facts , the condition @xmath66 appeared to be not so strict numerically , as an amplitude @xmath67 is enough to obtain @xmath68 ) .",
    "such a violation represents a large improvement compared to munro s best result of 0.076 @xcite , for a state with no singularity and at least as easy to produce as munro s @xmath69 optimized state ( [ psimunro ] ) .",
    "however , we are still away from the maximal value @xmath1 of the chsh bell inequality @xcite . in the following section",
    ", we will propose a set of states to get closer to the maximal violation .     and @xmath20 for a four - paws cat described by eqs.([f4 ] ) in position space ( left ) and momentum space ( right ) , with @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "left axes are in arbitrary units and normalized to unity . ]",
    "the result obtained with the 4 paws cat suggests that a way to get a stronger violation is to increase the total number @xmath72 of paws of the cat states @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the proper sign between the peaks .",
    "we thus define , for a given amplitude @xmath75    [ fn ] f_n;(q)_j=-^-1([2j+1 ] ) e^-(q-[j+])^2 + g_n;(q)_j=-^-1([2j+1 ] ) e^-(q-[j+])^2    ._s _ for n - paws cat defined by eqs.([fn ] ) and @xmath71 , each peak having the same high . [",

    "preparing entangled @xmath72 paws schrdinger cats is a challenging task , we begin by focusing our attention on how one single @xmath72 paws schrdinger cat as defined by ( [ gn ] ) could be generated .",
    "this state has strong similarities with the _ encoded states _ introduced by gottesman and coworkers @xcite to perform quantum error - correction codes .",
    "recently , travaglione and milburn @xcite presented a proposal to generate non - deterministically such _",
    "encoded states_. following this study , we will first show how to generate the state @xmath78 by applying a specific sequence of operations similar to @xcite and then derive a setup to produce the whole state ( [ oestate ] ) .",
    "the preparation procedure begins with the quantum system in the vacuum state @xmath79 and an ancilla qubit in the ground state @xmath80 ( if some squeezing parameter is needed , one may take a squeezed vacuum as quantum system and follow the procedure we describe here . for simplicity reasons",
    ", we set @xmath81 ) .",
    "let us first apply : @xmath82 with @xmath83 is the momentum operator applied to the continuous variable state , @xmath84 the hadamard gate and @xmath85 the pauli matrix applied to the qubit : @xmath86 we then have a probability 1/2 of measuring the qubit either in the excited or in the ground state .",
    "if it is found in the @xmath87 state , the continuous variable is left in the state @xmath88 , otherwise the procedure is stopped and we try again .",
    "the qubit is then bit - flipped to @xmath80 and we go on by applying the sequence @xmath89 measuring the qubit in the @xmath80 results in the continuous variable left in the state @xmath90 . to increase the number of paws , we iterate the following procedure given @xmath91 and the qubit in @xmath80 :    * apply the operators @xmath92 * measure the qubit * if the qubit was in the state @xmath80 , we have created @xmath93 * if the qubit was in the state @xmath87 , discard and try again .",
    "once the number of paws is considered satisfactory , we stop the previous iteration . the last point to generate",
    "@xmath78 is to apply the following sequence @xmath94 if the qubit is found in the state @xmath80 , we have created the state @xmath78 as defined in eq.([gn ] ) .",
    "if the protocol was stopped after @xmath95 iterations ( corresponding to @xmath93 ) , the state @xmath78 is created with probability @xmath96 and shows @xmath97 paws . in the last section of ref.@xcite , travaglione and milburn",
    "briefly consider the question of the physical implementation of this iteration process using a radio - frequency ion trap .",
    "we refer the reader to this article for further details .     with @xmath19 and @xmath20 defined by eqs.([fn ] ) .",
    "see text for the notations . ]    for the creation process of the state @xmath98 , we present on fig.[prepa ] a global view of our scheme .",
    "the @xmath99-labelled box corresponds to the generation of @xmath78 we just saw .",
    "our process is based on a cnot gate that entangles two qubits ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "each qubit is then associated with a state @xmath78 through the following operator @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the position operator of the @xmath78 state and @xmath85 the pauli matrix applied to the qubit .",
    "if the qubit is at zero , the @xmath78 state will be left unchanged .",
    "if the qubit is at one , for @xmath103 the sign of each two peak is changed so that the @xmath78 state is changed into the @xmath104 state .",
    "after this operator @xmath105 has been applied , the whole state is left in @xmath106 in order to disentangle the two qubits from the continuous part , one has to make the qubits pass through an hadamard plus a cnot gate .",
    "finally measuring one qubit in the zero state will project the continuous variable system onto the awaited state @xmath107    such a process generates the n - paws schrdinger cats as defined in ( [ fn ] ) where each peak has the same height .",
    "the case ( [ fgauss ] ) with a gaussian envelope is more complicated to produce because each peak must be separately weighted , but as seen in table [ tabns ] , the violation for a state ( [ fn ] ) with equal heights is already quite strong ( @xmath108 for @xmath109 ) .",
    "considering quadrature phase homodyne detection , we have derived a new binning process called _ root binning _ to transform the continuous variables measured into binary results to be used in the test of quantum mechanics versus local realistic theories . for this process",
    ", we propose a whole family of physical states that yield a violation arbitrarily close to the maximal violation in quantum mechanics and much stronger than previous works in the domain @xcite .",
    "we have also tested root binning on other interesting forms of bell inequality that are the information - theoretic inequalities developed by braunstein and caves @xcite and generalized by cerf and adami @xcite .",
    "using quadrature measurements , root binning and our state defined by eqs.([oestate],[fgauss ] ) , we unfortunately could find no violation for neither braunstein s nor cerf s form of information - theoretic bell inequality .",
    "our state in fact tends to the minimum limit for violation of these information inequalities when @xmath110 and @xmath111 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the binning process discards a lot of information that lies within each interval of the binning",
    ". this information loss may prevent any violation of information - theoretic inequalities .    as a conclusion ,",
    "let us point out that though the present idea sounds quite attractive , its practical implementation is very far - fetched . though we do propose a theoretical scheme to prepare the required states , it relies on various features ( coupling hamiltonian , cnot gates ) that are not presently available with the required degree of efficiency . for going in more details into the implementation of the present scheme , inefficiencies and associated decoherence effects should be examined in detail for each required step , i.e. preparation , propagation , and detection . also , various possible implementations of the proposed scheme should be considered @xcite .",
    "such a study is out of the scope of the present paper , that has mostly the goal to show that arbitrarily high violations of bell inequalities are in principle possible , by using continuous - variables measurements and physically meaningful - though hardly feasible - quantum states .",
    "this work is supported by the european ist / fet / qipc program , and by the french programs aci photoniqueand astre .",
    "an interesting point is to study the decomposition of states @xmath104 and @xmath78 on the fock basis @xmath112 , which are experimentally accessible . starting from states ( [ fgauss ] ) with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and with @xmath72 satisfying condition ( [ nlimitinf ] ) , we obtained after truncating at the @xmath115 order :        these states allow to reach a violation @xmath116 .",
    "the state @xmath104 only involves orders @xmath117 , as we have @xmath118 for @xmath78 .",
    "this directly comes from the fact that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , so that states of the form @xmath121 are eigenvectors of the fourier transform . from these considerations",
