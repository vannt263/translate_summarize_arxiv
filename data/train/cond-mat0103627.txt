    "we represent the residues of the membrane protein as single beads centered in their @xmath0 positions .",
    "adjacent beads are tethered together into a polymer chain by a harmonic potential with the average @xmath62 distance along the chain equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the membrane is described simply by a slab of width @xmath64 .",
    "two non - bonded residues @xmath65 form a contact if their distance is less then @xmath66 . in the study of globular proteins ,",
    "the topology of the native state is encoded in the contact map giving the pairs @xmath65 of non - bonded residues that are in contact .",
    "here , in addition , the locations of such pairs with respect to the membrane becomes crucial .",
    "the contacts are divided into three classes : _ membrane contacts _ where both @xmath67 and @xmath68 residues are inside the membrane , _ interface contacts _ with @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the interface region @xcite outside the membrane and _ surface contacts _ with one residue inside the membrane and the other outside .",
    "thus a given protein conformation can have a native contact but improperly placed with respect to the membrane ( _ misplaced native contact _ ) .",
    "the crucial interaction potential between non - bonded residues @xmath65 is taken to be a modified lennard - jones 12 - 10 potential : @xmath69 + 5\\ \\gamma_1(i , j)\\left ( \\frac{% d_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\\right)^{12}.\\ ] ] the matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 encode the topology of the tmp in the following way : if @xmath65 is not a contact in the native state @xmath72 ; if @xmath65 is a contact in the native state but not at the proper location ( i.e. a misplaced contact ) @xmath73 ; if @xmath65 is a native state contact in the proper region @xmath74 .",
    "this model is intended to describe the folding process in the interface and in the membrane region .",
    "our interaction potential ( similar in spirit to a well known model@xcite for globular proteins ( see also other approaches that model helix formation @xcite ) ) assigns two values to the energy associated with the formation of a native contact , @xmath61 and @xmath75 .",
    "the model captures the tendency to form native contacts .",
    "in addition , in order to account for the effective interactions between the membrane and the protein , the model assigns a lower energy , @xmath76 , to the contact which occurs in the same region as in the native state structure compared to @xmath77 when the contact is formed but in the wrong region of space .",
    "this feature proves to be crucial in determining the mechanism of insertion of the protein across the membrane in order to place all native contacts in the same regions as in the native state .",
    "even though the interaction potential is simple and intuitively appealing , it is not possible to simply guess ( without detailed calculations ) the folding mechanism and quantitatively determine the probability of occurrence of the various folding pathways@xcite .",
    "when @xmath78 , the protein does not recognize the presence of the interface - membrane region and the full rotational symmetry is restored ( the system behaves like a globular protein ) .",
    "the difference in the parameters ( @xmath79 ) controls the amount of tertiary structure formation outside the membrane .",
    "when the difference is small , the protein assembles almost completely outside the membrane and the insertion process would be diffusion limited .",
    "our results are independent of the precise values of the energy parameters @xmath61 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) as long as they are not too close to each other .",

    "is added which biases the helices to be in their native state structure .",
    "the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the model were studied by a monte carlo method for polymer chains allowing for local deformations .",
    "the efficiency of the program ( usually low for continuum calculations ) has been increased by full use of the link cell technique @xcite and by the multiple markov chain method , a new sampling scheme , which has been proven to be particulary efficient in exploring the low temperature phase diagram for polymers @xcite . in our simulation @xmath88 different temperatures ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90 have been studied .",
    "the free energy is calculated by reweighting the different temperatures with the ferrenberg - swendsen @xcite algorithm .",
    "the free energy difference @xmath91 between two states a and b has been estimated as the reversible work that has to be done in order to go from a to b. hence , denoting by @xmath92 a reaction coordinate connecting a and b ( for @xmath93 and @xmath94 the system is in a and b respectively ) , and by @xmath95 , the canonical average at fixed reaction coordinate , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the force and @xmath98 is a suitably dense partition of the interval @xmath99 .",
    "the average value @xmath100 at each @xmath101 is computed by a long ( more than 5000 steps ) monte carlo run performed with dynamics satisfying the constraint @xmath102 .",

    "<S> such helical fragments have a greater propensity to subsequently diffuse into the lipid phase .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of tmp has not yet been possible because little is known about the interactions between amino acids inside the membrane or between them and the lipid molecules . here </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt a simple , yet powerful , strategy for attacking the folding properties of tmp that circumvents this shortcoming . </S>",
    "<S> our novel approach is based on extensive studies of the folding of globular proteins which have underscored the important role played by the topology of the native state in controlling both the functionality and the main features of the folding process . </S>",
    "<S> nature uses a rich repertory of twenty kinds of amino acids with sometimes major and at other times subtle differences in their interactions with the solvent and with each other in order to design sequences that fit the putative native state with minimal frustration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a fruitful and general strategy for the study of protein folding would be to extract information on the folding process directly from the topology of the native state .    our study here focuses on the folding process by using a tractable approach ( described in the methods section ) that by - passes the details of the complex interactions of the protein in the lipid enviroment by introducing effective potentials , induced by the presence of the membrane and the associated interface region , that stabilize the native state structure . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the approach based on the native state topology , in the case of globular proteins , has been confirmed a posteriori from the agreement between theory and experimental findings @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our studies were carried out using a monte carlo algorithm that has been proven to be extremely efficient for interacting hetero - polymers ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the structural similarity between the system equilibrated at temperature @xmath8 ( measured in dimensionless units ) and the native state is shown in figure @xmath9 in terms of the average fraction of native state contacts as a function of @xmath8 and partitioned depending on their positions with respect to the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the three curves correspond respectively to the average fraction of native contacts inside ( @xmath10 ) , outside ( @xmath11 ) and across ( @xmath12 ) the membrane ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these curves , well separated at high t , collapse for @xmath8 below the transition temperature @xmath13 , indicating a cooperative effect in the folding . on monitoring the free energy as a function of the energy around @xmath14 , one observes additional local minima ( besides those corresponding to the unfolded and folded states ) suggesting the presence of an intermediate .    </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate is characterized by having the two helices almost completely formed but not yet correctly inserted across the membrane . a metastable state in which the protein exists at the membrane interface ought to be expected on general grounds . </S>",
    "<S> indeed a generic heteropolymer with hydrophobic and hydrophilic aminoacids , of which a tmp is a particular case , has a favorable conformation which is localized near surfaces between two selective media ( the outside and the inside part of the membrane in the present case)@xcite . at not too high temperatures , the gain in energy to place hydrophobic / hydrophilic protein segments in their preferred enviroment compensates the entropy loss for being localized at the interface with respect to remain in the bulk phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even though our model does not explicitly contain information on the character of the amino acids , it is able to predict this feature .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these extra minima suggests that non - constitutive membrane proteins would fold with multi - state kinetics corresponding to on - pathway intermediates . to establish their nature of and their influence on the dominant folding pathways </S>",

    "<S> the free energy of this state ( measured with respect to the free energy of the fully folded state ) is @xmath24 t@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this state corresponds to the formation of around @xmath26 of the membrane contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the average time @xmath27 to reach state @xmath28 is of the order of @xmath29 monte carlo steps ( see figures @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; each monte - carlo step corresponds to 50000 attempted local deformations . ) . </S>",
    "<S> state hi turns out to be an obligatory on - pathway intermediate of the folding kinetics for non - constitutive mp in agreement with the general argument mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> once the protein reaches state @xmath28 , it undergoes a relatively slow process of self - arrangement in order to insert and assemble the secondary structures across the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> this process is the rate - limiting step of the folding process , since it involves the translocation , through the lipidic layer , of a substantial number of hydrophilic residues . among the possible pathways , starting from @xmath28 , the most frequent ( @xmath32 of the cases ) and the fastest turn out to be @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative characterization of this dominant pathway is presented in figures 3 ( for a single folding process ) and 4 ( as an average over @xmath34 folding processes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate @xmath35 is characterized by having one @xmath6 helix inserted across the membrane and is reached in an average period corresponding to a significant fraction of the total folding time ( see figure @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy in this state is @xmath36 @xmath37 the free energy barrier between @xmath38 and @xmath35 is at @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath14 ( hence , the rate constant of the transition @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 ) . the full free energy profile versus a reaction coordinate is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the last part of the folding process corresponds to the insertion of the second helix and the assembly of the two secondary structures into the native state structure . </S>",
    "<S> this process lasts approximately one third of the folding time along the pathway @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasistatic free energy barrier between @xmath35 and the folded state is @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate costant of the transition @xmath46 is , therefore , proportional to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the time scales observed in the unconstrained folding dynamics . at the end , the protein is completely packed , ( @xmath10 saturates to 1 ( figures @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) ) and the helices are correctly positioned across the membrane ( note the second jump in the @xmath50 coordinate of the center of mass in figures @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> much slower dynamics can occur when non - obligatory intermediates are visited by the system . </S>",
    "<S> these long lived states ( @xmath53 in figure @xmath17 ) involve a distribution of misfolded regions that trap the system and are characterized by having most of the inter - helical contacts formed ( assembly of the secondary structures ) but with the two @xmath54-helices still incorrectly positioned . </S>",
    "<S> note , for example , that in states @xmath53 , only transmembrane contacts and some contacts outside the membrane are misplaced and they account for only a small fraction of the native state energy . for this reason , in the states @xmath55 , the free energy is @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 @xmath14 , only slightly higher than the free energy of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the folding can proceed from @xmath57 either by disentangling the two helices and passing through the obligatory intermediate @xmath35 , or by the simultaneous translocation through the membrane of the two helices . </S>",
    "<S> these processes , however , entail the crossing of a big free energy barrier ( @xmath39 @xmath58 @xmath14 for the first process and @xmath59 for the second ) and happen with low probability . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at sufficiently low temperatures , the loss in energy of the interhelical contacts is not compensated by the gain in the configurational entropy due to the uncoupling of the @xmath60helices . </S>",
    "<S> thus below the folding temperature , i - states act as trapping regions for the system and when trapped , the protein spends most of the time during folding in this state .    in summary , we have presented detailed calculations of helical transmembrane proteins leading to a vivid picture of the folding process . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy relies on the dominant role played by the topology of the native state structure and by the effective geometry imposed by the membrane and provides a picture which would be expected to be quite accurate for well - designed sequences that are a good fit to the target native state conformation . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that , with our choice of the parameters , the pathway in which the helices assemble outside the membrane and are inserted later is unlikely to occur .    </S>",
    "<S> models based on the topology of the native state structure have been remarkably successful @xcite in correctly describing the main features of the folding process determined in experiments @xcite for various globular proteins . </S>",
    "<S> a similar approach has been generalized here to the almost virgin field of transmembrane proteins where experiments are rather difficult@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our findings do not depend on the precise values of the @xmath61 parameters introduced in the model underscoring the robustness of the results . </S>",
    "<S> our approach predicts a folding process involving multiple pathways with a dominant folding channel . </S>",
    "<S> the simpliciy of our model allows for a quantitative description of all the pathways since we can monitor the correct / uncorrect formation of native contacts and compute free energy profiles . </S>",
    "<S> further details not captured by the present approach arising from amino - acid specific interactions among themselves , with the solvent and in particular with the interior of the membrane may of course change the quantitative nature of the results . </S>",
    "<S> however , our model , which captures the bare essentials of a membrane protein , ought to provide a zeroth order picture of the folding process . </S>",
    "<S> also , as experimental data becomes available , the results could be benchmarked with models of this type to glean the other factors that matter . </S>"
