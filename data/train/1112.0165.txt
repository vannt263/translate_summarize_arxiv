    "one of the main algorithmic decision problems regarding braids ( viewed as mapping classes of a punctured closed disk ) is the problem to determine the nielsen - thurston type of a given braid : reducible , periodic or pseudo - anosov @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this problem is called the _ reducibility _ problem because it amounts to determining whether a given non - periodic braid is reducible or not , i.e. whether it is reducible or pseudo - anosov . indeed ,",
    "the case of periodic braids can be easily discarded : a braid  @xmath0 is periodic if and only if its @xmath1th power or its @xmath2st power is a power of the half - twist  @xmath3 ( see  @xcite ) ; and this is easy to decide algorithmically .    to solve the reducibility problem ,",
    "two kinds of techniques have been used and several algorithms have been written ; however none of them works in polynomial time with respect to the braid length for the general braid group  @xmath4 .",
    "firstly , the bestvina - handel algorithm @xcite uses the theory of train - tracks and it is valid for any mapping class group .",
    "although this algorithm works fast in practice , its theoretical complexity remains unknown .",
    "secondly , following the ideas introduced by benardete , gutierrez and nitecki @xcite , connections between the reducibility problem and the garside structures of braid groups have been used for detecting reducibility @xcite .",
    "our work fits in this approach and builds mainly on the last algorithm by gonzlez - meneses and wiest @xcite .",
    "however garside tools are not the only ones needed in the paper : we bring into play a very deep property of mapping class groups : the so - called _ linearly bounded conjugator property _",
    "@xcite , see theorem [ masur ] . at this point",
    "we already warn the reader that the algorithm given in the paper is not well - defined ( although it will be actually described ) because it rests on the above linear bound , which is not explicitly known .",
    "therefore our main result is an existence result only .",
    "the latter can be stated as follows . for a braid @xmath0 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath5 the minimal possible length of a word representing @xmath0 whose letters are positive permutation braids and their inverses ( in other words , the letters are braids in which any pair of strands crosses at most once and all crossings have the same orientation )",
    ".    we will prove :    [ main ] let @xmath1 be a positive integer .",
    "there exists an algorithm which decides the nielsen - thurston type of any given braid @xmath0 with @xmath1 strands and runs in time @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : garside ] we recall useful tools from garside theory and give precise statements relating the latter and the reducibility problem ; an actual description of the algorithm whose existence is stated in theorem [ main ] is also given .",
    "the detailed proofs are deferred to section 3 .",
    "we first recall some basic notions of garside theory in the specific case of braid groups , with emphasis on the _ classical _ structure ; references are @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a general account on garside groups .",
    "the _ classical garside structure _ of the braid group consists in the following 2-fold data :   @xmath7 is the monoid whose elements are braids which can be expressed as words on the artin generators @xmath8 with only positive exponents and @xmath3 is the so - called _ garside element _ or half - twist .    the relation @xmath9 on @xmath4 defined by @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 defines a partial order called _ prefix order _ , which turns out to be a lattice order .",
    "we will denote by @xmath12 the inner automorphism associated to @xmath3 : this is an involution which for each @xmath13 , maps @xmath8 to @xmath14 ; actually the center of @xmath4 ( @xmath15 ) is the cyclic group generated by @xmath16 .",
    "it can be shown that for any braid  @xmath0 , there exist relative integers @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "this allows to define the so - called _ infimum _ and _ supremum _ of @xmath0 , respectively : @xmath19 the _ canonical length _ of @xmath0 is defined by @xmath20 .",
    "a central property of garside groups is the existence of a distinguished generating set allowing for the definition of normal forms .",
    "consider the set of positive prefixes of @xmath3 ; these elements are called _ simple elements _ or _ positive permutation braids _ ( because they are in one - to - one correspondence with the elements of the symmetric group on @xmath1 objects ) .",
    "geometrically , simple elements are positive braids in which every pair of strands crosses at most once .",
    "because it contains all artin s generators @xmath8 , the set of simple elements generates @xmath4 .    a pair @xmath21 of simple elements is said to be _ left - weighted _ if for any non - trivial positive prefix @xmath22 of @xmath23 , the product @xmath24 is not a simple element .",
    "this allows to state :    @xcite let @xmath25 .",
    "there exists a unique decomposition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , the @xmath28 are simple elements with @xmath29 and ( if @xmath30 ) the pair @xmath31 is left - weighted for @xmath32 .",
    "we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "recall the braid length @xmath35 defined in the introduction .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that every braid admits a unique decomposition of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are positive braids having no common non - trivial positive prefix .",
    "this is called the _ mixed canonical form_. moreover , if @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the left normal forms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , it is shown in @xcite that the word @xmath42 is a geodesic in the cayley graph of @xmath4 with respect to the set of simple elements .",
    "hence the braid length @xmath35 is given by the length of the mixed canonical form .",
    "finally notice that the latter is related to the canonical length in the following way : if @xmath26 is the left normal form of @xmath25 , we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "although we do not need that , it is worth mentionning that the braid group admits another garside structure , called the _ dual garside structure _ , see @xcite .",
    "the existence of normal forms for braids allows to construct algorithms for solving the conjugacy problem in the braid groups , that is for deciding whether any two given braids are conjugate and finding a conjugator whenever there exists one @xcite .",
    "we now recall some related notions .",
    "all existing algorithms for solving the conjugacy problem in braid groups rely on the definition of a particular finite computable characteristic subset of each conjugacy class in  @xmath4 , consisting of its  simplest \" elements ( in some sense ) .",
    "a first example of such a characteristic subset is given by the following :    @xcite let @xmath25 .",
    "the subset of the conjugacy class of  @xmath0 consisting of all elements with minimal canonical length is finite ( and non - empty ) .",
    "its elements have simultaneously maximal infimum and minimal supremum within the conjugacy class of @xmath0 .",
    "this set is called the super summit set of @xmath0 and is denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "an element in the super summit set of a given braid can be computed using a special kind of conjugation called _ cyclic sliding _ :    @xcite let @xmath26 be the normal form of @xmath25 .",
    "suppose that @xmath46 .",
    "the _ preferred prefix _ of @xmath0 is the maximal positive prefix @xmath22 of @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is a simple element ; it is denoted by @xmath49 . if @xmath50 , that is if @xmath0 is a power of @xmath3 , @xmath49 is just defined to be the trivial braid .",
    "the result of the conjugation of @xmath0 by its preferred prefix @xmath49 is called _ cyclic sliding _ of @xmath0 and denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the cyclic sliding operation actually achieves computing elements in super summit sets , in an effective way .",
    "indeed , only a polynomial ( with respect to both length and braid index ) number of iterations of @xmath52 is required to compute an element in the super summit set :    @xcite[t : bklbound ] let @xmath25 .",
    "the following alternative holds : @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "another ( smaller ) example of conjugacy invariant subset was defined later by gebhardt and gonzlez - meneses :    @xcite let @xmath25 .",
    "the subset of the conjugacy class of @xmath0 consisting of all elements which are periodic points under the cyclic sliding operation is finite and non - empty .",
    "it is a subset of the super summit set of @xmath0 , called set of sliding circuits of @xmath0 and denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "iterative application of the cyclic sliding operation to a braid @xmath0 eventually reaches an element of @xmath55 ; however by contrast with the case of @xmath45 , no general bound on the number of repetitions involved is known ( see conjecture [ conj ] ) .    to conclude this paragraph",
    ", we recall the important notion of _ rigid _ braid :    @xcite a braid @xmath0 is said to be _ rigid _ if its preferred prefix is trivial .    in particular a rigid braid",
    "is a fixed point of @xmath52 and is an element of its own set of sliding circuits .",
    "moreover , if a conjugacy class contains one rigid braid , then the corresponding set of sliding circuits consists only of rigid braids @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the relations between the reducibility problem and the notions above .",
    "first of all , we recall some definitions and properties related to reducible braids .",
    "let @xmath56 be the closed disk in @xmath57 with diameter @xmath58 $ ] and with the points @xmath59 removed . as the mapping class group of @xmath56 , the braid group @xmath4 induces a ( right)-action on the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves in @xmath56 .",
    "a curve is said to be _ non - degenerate _ if it is not contractible and surrounds more than one and less than @xmath1 punctures . by the word",
    " curve \" alone we will mean the isotopy class of a non - degenerate simple closed curve .    a braid @xmath0 is _ reducible _ if it preserves setwise a family of curves ; such a curve is then said to be a _ reducing _ curve for @xmath0 .",
    "notice that reducibility is a conjugacy - invariant property .",
    "moreover a reducible braid  @xmath0 is not periodic if the set of its _ essential _ reducing curves , that is reducing curves which do not intersect any other reducing curve , is not empty .",
    "an important matter when we want to detect the reducibility of a braid is to actually detect reducing curves whenever they exist .",
    "this leads to formulate :    @xcite a curve @xmath60 in @xmath56 is said to be _ round _ if it is isotopic to a geometric circle in  @xmath56 .",
    "a curve @xmath60 in @xmath56 is said to be _ almost round _ if it has a unique maximum and a unique minimum in the horizontal direction .",
    "the latter is equivalent to saying that @xmath60 can be transformed into a round curve by the action of a simple element .",
    "whenever a reducible braid preserves a family of round curves , the reducibility is easy to detect ( there are only @xmath61 round curves ) , see @xcite .",
    "moreover the notion of roundness of a curve behaves well with respect to garside - theoretic operations :    @xcite[t : cyclicslidinground ] let @xmath25 be a reducible braid preserving a family of round curves .",
    "then so does @xmath51 .",
    "notice that any family of curves can be transformed into a family of round curves under the action of some braid , in other word a reducible braid always preserves a family of round curves up to conjugacy .",
    "it follows from theorems [ t : bklbound ] and [ t : cyclicslidinground ] that for any reducible braid @xmath0 , there exists some element of @xmath45 that preserves a family of round curves .    therefore computing the whole super summit set of a braid",
    "gives a manner of testing its reducibility : @xmath0 is reducible if and only if some element in @xmath45 preserves a family of round curves .",
    "we remark that the same approach can be carried out in the framework of the dual garside structure , replacing round curves by _ standard _ curves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however in either structure , the resulting algorithm is far from polynomial because the super summit sets are exponentially large in general , with respect to both length and braid index @xcite .    in the special case of the four - strand braid group @xmath62 , it is possible to overcome the latter difficulty , showing that _ every _ element of the ( classical ) super summit set of a given reducible 4-braid with a reducing curve surrounding three punctures preserves a round or an almost - round curve",
    "this leads to a polynomial - time algorithm for solving the reducibility problem in @xmath62 , described in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "lee and lee replaced the condition about _ some _ element of the _ super _ summit set of a reducible braid @xmath0 by the condition that _ every _ element of the _ ultra _ summit set of  @xmath0 ( which is another conjugacy invariant subset introduced in @xcite ) preserves a family of round curves .",
    "however this was shown at the cost of a technical hypothesis about the external and internal components of  @xmath0 .    in @xcite",
    ", gonzlez - meneses and wiest showed that every element of ( some refined version of ) the set of sliding circuits of a reducible braid preserves a family of round or almost - round curves .    both approaches from @xcite and @xcite",
    "suffer the same drawback , namely the lack of control on the distance to the first repetition when applying iteratively the cyclic sliding operation .",
    "the algorithm in @xcite indeed solves the reducibility problem in arbitrary braid groups with polynomial complexity , both in braid length and braid index , provided the following conjecture holds :    [ conj](@xcite , conjecture 3.5 ) let @xmath25 , with canonical length @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the minimal positive integer such that @xmath64 for some @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath22 is bounded by a polynomial in @xmath63 and @xmath1 .",
    "one of the keys for proving theorem [ main ] will be a partial demonstration of conjecture [ conj ] .",
    "we shall prove , using masur - minsky s linear bound :    [ alternativepa ] there exists a constant @xmath67 ( depending only on @xmath1 ) such that for any pseudo - anosov @xmath1-strand braid @xmath54 , the following holds : @xmath0 has a rigid conjugate if and only if @xmath68 is rigid .    theorem [ alternativepa ]",
    "gives a partial solution to conjecture [ conj ] : in the pseudo - anosov rigid case , starting from a super summit element , theorem [ alternativepa ] guarantees that a rigid conjugate ( or equivalently an element of the set of sliding circuits ) is found after only @xmath69 iterations of cyclic sliding ( in other words , if a pseudo - anosov super summit braid has rigid conjugates , then the cyclic sliding operation converges towards one of them in linear time with respect to braid length ) .",
    "this gives in this particular case ( with the notation of conjecture [ conj ] ) the bound @xmath70 .",
    "the importance of the rigid case comes from the following result , which will play a crucial role in our proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "it is due to birman , gebhardt and gonzlez - meneses :    @xcite.[bggm1 ] let @xmath25 be a pseudo - anosov braid .",
    "there exists a positive integer @xmath71 such that @xmath72 is conjugate to a rigid braid .",
    "finally we recall the two following results from @xcite :    ( @xcite , theorem 5.16).[5.16 ] let @xmath25 be a non - periodic , reducible braid which is rigid .",
    "then some essential reducing curve of @xmath0 is round or almost - round .",
    "more precisely , there is some positive integer @xmath73 such that one of the following holds :    * @xmath74 preserves a round essential curve , * @xmath75 and @xmath76 are even and either @xmath77 or @xmath78 is a positive braid preserving an almost - round essential reducing curve whose interior strands do not cross .",
    "( @xcite , theorem 2.9).[2.9 ] there is an algorithm which decides whether a given positive braid @xmath0 preserves an almost - round curve whose interior strands do not cross .",
    "its complexity is @xmath79 .",
    "we are now ready to describe the algorithm promised in theorem [ main ] .",
    "it takes as input an @xmath1-braid  @xmath0 .",
    "the output is  periodic \" ,  reducible \" or  pseudo - anosov \" .    *",
    "if @xmath80 or @xmath81 is a power of @xmath3 , return  periodic \" and stop . * for @xmath82 compute the normal form of @xmath83 .",
    "iteratively apply cyclic sliding to  @xmath83 until the canonical length has not decreased during the @xmath84 last iterations .",
    "this computes @xmath85 .",
    "then compute @xmath86 .",
    "if none of the braids @xmath87 is rigid return  reducible \" and stop .",
    "else let @xmath88 be such that  @xmath89 is rigid .",
    "* for @xmath90 , apply the algorithm in @xcite to the braid @xmath91 to test whether it preserves a round curve ; apply the algorithm in theorem [ 2.9 ] to both braids @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "if a round or an almost - round reducing curve is found , then return  reducible \" and stop .",
    "* return  pseudo - anosov \" .",
    "as mentioned above , we remark that this algorithm , and specifically step 2 , is not well - defined because the constant @xmath67 is not explicitly known . in the next section , we will prove theorem [ alternativepa ] , show the correctness of the above algorithm and study its complexity .",
    "in order to prove theorem [ alternativepa ] , we combine two important results .",
    "the first one is the already mentionned linearly bounded conjugator property for mapping class groups @xcite .",
    "although the range of surfaces considered by masur and minsky is much broader , only the ( @xmath94-times punctured sphere @xmath95 ( @xmath15 ) is relevant for our purposes , so we state their result in this special case :    ( @xcite , theorem 7.2).[masur ] let  @xmath96 be any generating set of the maping class group @xmath97 .",
    "there exists a constant  @xmath98 , depending only on @xmath96 , such that any pair of conjugate pseudo - anosov mapping classes can be related by a conjugating element  @xmath99 satisfying @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 denotes the word length with respect to the chosen generating set  @xmath96 ) .",
    "[ masurbraids ] there exists a constant  @xmath102 , depending only on @xmath1 , such that any pair of conjugate pseudo - anosov @xmath1-braids can be related by a conjugating element  @xmath99 satisfying @xmath103    before proving proposition [ masurbraids ] , we recall that the quotient @xmath104 can be seen as the mapping class group of an @xmath1-times punctured closed disk ( with boundary fixed setwise ) . for a braid @xmath0 in @xmath4 , denote by @xmath105 its image in the quotient @xmath104 .",
    "simple elements are sent bijectively to a generating set of the quotient ( whose elements we still call simple ) ; this defines a length @xmath106 on @xmath104 ( notice that for any braid  @xmath0 , @xmath107 ) . collapsing",
    "the boundary of the @xmath1-times punctured closed disk to a puncture in the sphere  @xmath95 ( where the punctures are uniformly placed along the horizontal great circle ) , we can view @xmath104 as the finite index subgroup of @xmath108 consisting of the mapping classes which fix the @xmath109st puncture .",
    "the group @xmath108 is equipped with the generating set consisting of the simple elements in the quotient @xmath104 together with a clockwise rotation by an angle of  @xmath110 , which we denote by @xmath111 .",
    "notice that for any @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 .",
    "conversely , we will see in a simple computational way that the length @xmath114 is linearly bounded in terms of @xmath115 :      let @xmath112 .",
    "we will construct a word representative @xmath117 of @xmath118 using only the letters @xmath119 such that @xmath120 .",
    "this is achieved thanks to the following relations in @xmath108 ( which can be easily deduced from the presentation in @xcite theorem 4.5 ) . for @xmath121 , @xmath122 : @xmath123 this allows to gather ( at the beginning ) all powers of @xmath111 appearing in a shortest representative for  @xmath118 on the alphabet @xmath124 ; this results in a power of @xmath125 ( because @xmath112 ) followed by a word @xmath117 in @xmath119 .",
    "the word @xmath117 represents @xmath118 and as a word on the simple elements and their inverses , its length is bounded by @xmath126 ( because each simple element can be written with at most @xmath61 letters  @xmath127 so that the above relations are used at most @xmath126 times ; and because both @xmath128 and @xmath129 are simple ) .    _ proof of proposition [ masurbraids ] . _ given a pair of conjugate pseudo - anosov @xmath1-braids @xmath0 and  @xmath130 , we know a conjugating element between  @xmath105 and @xmath131 , say @xmath132 in the quotient @xmath104 . in their proof of theorem  [ masur ] , masur and minsky construct a  short \" conjugating element @xmath133 between  @xmath105 and @xmath131 ; this element  @xmath133 is expressed as a product @xmath134 , for some integer @xmath135 and therefore it belongs to the subgroup @xmath104 of @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , @xmath136 and we get from lemma [ calcul ] @xmath137    finally , as @xmath138 is the center of @xmath4 , and because a braid @xmath0 conjugate to @xmath130 can not be conjugate to @xmath139 for @xmath140 , any lifting of @xmath133 in @xmath4 conjugates @xmath0 to @xmath130 and we can choose one , say @xmath99 , so that @xmath141 .",

    "it follows that @xmath166 .",

    "first , by theorem [ t : bklbound ] , the braid  @xmath174 is an element of @xmath175 for each @xmath13 .",
    "then if @xmath0 is a pseudo - anosov braid , by theorem  [ bggm1 ] , at least one of the braids  @xmath83 ( and therefore  @xmath174 ) is pseudo - anosov with a rigid conjugate and by theorem  [ alternativepa ] at least one of the braids  @xmath87 is rigid .",
    "let us calculate the complexity of step 2 .",
    "the computations of normal forms are known to be quadratic with respect to the length @xcite .",
    "we then recall that each instance of cyclic sliding ( when applied to a braid already in normal form ) has linear complexity with respect to the braid length for any given braid index ( see @xcite , theorem 4.4 ) .",
    "therefore for any @xmath176 , the complexity of computing @xmath174 ( which requires at most @xmath177 iterations of cyclic sliding ) is quadratic with respect to the braid length whenever @xmath1 is fixed .",
    "the same is true for the computation of  @xmath87 from @xmath174 which requires @xmath178 iterations of cyclic sliding .",
    "the validity of step 3 follows from theorem [ 5.16 ] .",
    "this step consists in applying the algorithm in  @xcite to at most @xmath1 braids of length at most @xmath179 and the algorithm of theorem [ 2.9 ] to at most @xmath180 braids of length at most @xmath179 .",
    "both of these algorithms work in linear time with respect to the length so that step 3 is linear with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath143    we notice that the present algorithm does not always yield the knowledge of reducing curves for reducible elements ( actually this failure happens when reducibility is detected at step  2 ) .",
    "thus , in view of the program in @xcite , @xcite ,  @xcite , writing an algorithm for solving the conjugacy problem in braid groups in polynomial time still requires the following :    * find explicitly the constant @xmath67 to make the algorithm in  theorem [ main ] explicit .",
    "this amounts to bounding explicitly the required number of cyclic slidings to obtain ( if it exists ) a rigid conjugate from a pseudo - anosov super summit element ( see theorem [ alternativepa ] ) ; alternatively this rests on the knowledge of an explicit value for masur - minsky s constant  @xmath102 ( see proposition [ masurbraids ] ) , * find reducing curves of a braid , in polynomial time , whenever the braid is known to be reducible , * find a polynomial bound on the number of rigid braids in a given pseudo - anosov conjugacy class .",
