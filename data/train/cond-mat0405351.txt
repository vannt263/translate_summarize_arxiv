    "the behavior of classical physical systems is typically described in terms of equations of motion for discrete microscopic objects ( e.g.  atoms ) .",
    "the dynamics of the microscopic objects is usually very erratic and complex .",
    "nevertheless , in many cases a smooth behavior emerges when the system is observed on macroscopic length and time scales ( e.g.  in fluid flow through a pipe ) .",
    "a fundamental problem in physics is to understand the emergence of the smooth macroscopic behavior of a system starting from its microscopic description . a useful way to address",
    "this problem is to construct a continuum , coarse - grained model , which treats the dynamics of the macroscopic , smoothly varying , degrees of freedom rather than the microscopic ones .",
    "the derivation of continuum models from the microscopic dynamics is far from trivial . in most cases",
    "it is done in a phenomenological manner by introducing various uncontrolled approximations .    in this work",
    "we address the above problem in the context of the dynamics of crystal surfaces .",
    "the evolution of crystal surfaces below the roughening transition proceeds by the motion of discrete atomic steps which are separated by high symmetry orientation terraces .",
    "one can model step motion by solving the diffusion problem of adatoms on the terraces with appropriate boundary conditions at step edges .",
    "this approach was introduced long ago by burton , cabrera and frank @xcite , and was further developed by other authors @xcite .",
    "the resulting models specify the normal velocity of each step in the system as a function of its position and shape and as a function of position and shapes of neighboring steps .",
    "these step flow models are capable of describing surface evolution on the mesoscopic scale with significant success @xcite .",
    "however , step flow models pose a serious challenge for numerical computations , and can be solved only for small systems .",
    "several attempts were made to construct continuum models for stepped surfaces @xcite , in order to understand their large scale properties .",
    "the general idea behind these attempts is that step flow can be treated continuously in regions where every morphological surface feature is composed of many steps .",
    "if we label surface steps by the index @xmath0 , the continuum limit in these models is obtained by taking @xmath0 to be continuous .",
    "in what follows we will refer to these models as the _ conventional _ approach .    in the literature ,",
    "there are two methods to derive conventional continuum models .",
    "one method is to write down the discrete step equations of motion and then transform them into a partial differential equation by taking the step index @xmath0 to be continuous @xcite .",
    "the second method is to start with a continuous surface free energy density and derive a surface dynamic equation that minimizes it@xcite .",
    "these two methods are complementary provided that : 1 .",
    "the free energy density of the second method is the continuum analog of the free energy of an array of discrete steps .",
    "the two methods uses the same mass transport mechanism .",
    "such continuum models are fairly successful in describing the evolution of smooth surfaces with very simple morphologies .",
    "however , they suffer from fundamental drawbacks , which do not allow generalizations to more complex and realistic situations .",
    "the most severe drawback is that below the roughening temperature , crystal surfaces have singularities in the form of corners and macroscopic facets .",
    "the latter are a manifestation of the cusp singularity of the surface free energy at high symmetry crystal orientations .",
    "the assumption that every surface feature is composed of many steps clearly breaks down on macroscopic facets where there are no steps at all .",
    "thus , existing continuum models fail conceptually near singular regions .",
    "several authors have tried to overcome this problem by solving a continuum model only in the non - singular parts of the surface and then carefully match the boundary conditions at the singular points or lines@xcite . in most cases",
    "however it is not at all clear how these matching conditions can be derived .",
    "this difficulty is a fundamental drawback of conventional continuum models and not merely a technicality . as we argue below , boundary conditions at the singular points or lines",
    "can not be derived in the context of conventional continuum models .    to see why this is true consider the situation near a facet edge .",
    "the step at the facet edge is special and obeys a unique equation of motion . in contrast to steps in the sloping parts of the surface which all have two neighboring steps of the same sign , a facet step has only one neighbor of the same sign and potentially a second neighbor of an opposite sign .",
    "there might also be special physical conditions such as surface reconstruction that add to the uniqueness of a facet step . as we found in several cases @xcite",
    ", the unique behavior of a facet step sensitively determines the amount of material emitted or absorbed at the facet and the rate at which steps cross the facet and annihilate .",
    "when going to the continuum limit these quantities serve as flux boundary conditions at the singularity .",
    "the problem is that conventional continuum models are derived from the equations of motion ( or from the surface free energy density ) that apply away from the facet and are therefore ignorant of the special behavior of facet steps .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions at the facet edge must be derived from a careful analysis of the discrete dynamics of faces steps . however , in going to the continuum in the conventional way , one loses the information regarding the position of individual steps and the discrete analysis can not be performed .",
    "another approach for dealing with surface singularities is to round the surface free energy cusp @xcite , approximating true facets by relatively flat but analytic regions .",
    "this method avoids the need of specifying explicit boundary conditions at the singularity by assuming analyticity of the surface . the correct surface behavior is then expected to be captured in the limit of vanishing cusp rounding .",
    "this procedure completely ignores the key role of facet steps and implicitly assumes that the surface free energy derived for non singular orientations determines the dynamics on facets as well .",
    "this assumption is generally false due to the same reasons discussed above .",
    "an example for a case where cusp rounding leads to erroneous results can be found in appendix [ cusp_rounding_appendix ] .    in this work",
    "we propose a conceptually new definition of the continuum limit , which we term configurational continuum@xcite .",
    "configurational continuum allows construction of continuum models , which are free of all the limitations of conventional continuum models discussed above .",
    "it provides a rigorous way of deriving the continuum model directly from the discrete step equations of motion . like other continuum models ,",
    "configurational continuum has a clear computational advantage over the discrete step model due to the small number of discretization points it requires for the description of smooth surface regions in a numerical scheme .",
    "in order to overcome the limitations of conventional continuum models we now propose a conceptually new definition of the continuum limit for stepped surfaces .",
    "our key observation is that a continuous surface height profile can be represented by many similar , but not identical , step configurations .",
    "figure [ ensemble ] is a one dimensional demonstration of this point .",
    "it shows a continuous height function , @xmath1 , of position @xmath2 ( thick solid line ) , and three valid microscopic representations of this profile as step configurations .",
    "the main idea of this work is to define the height profile in the continuum limit as the upper envelope of the discrete height functions of an _ ensemble _ of many such step configurations .    to construct the configurations of the ensemble",
    "let @xmath3 be the height of a single step and @xmath4 the number of configurations in the ensemble .",
    "we construct the ensemble so that the height difference @xmath5 , between two adjacent configurations is @xmath6 , as depicted in fig .  [ ensemble ] .",
    "the continuum limit is obtained when @xmath7 .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "the dynamics of the continuum model is as follows .",
    "each step configuration of the ensemble evolves according to the microscopic dynamics . as a result ,",
    "the envelope of discrete height functions changes with time , thus defining the evolution of the continuous height function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a vector in the high symmetry @xmath10 plane .",
    "there is one technical complication which might arise if two steps from different configurations cross each other .",
    "such an event would make @xmath8 a multi valued function of position and requires a more general mathematical description of the surface . for simplicity we ignore this and assume that @xmath8 remains single valued .",
    "there is a crucial assumption hidden in this definition of the continuum model .",
    "we postulate that our construction leads to a mathematically well defined height function at all times .",
    "when does this assumptions hold ?",
    "consider two initially similar configurations of the ensemble .",
    "our continuum limit is well defined provided these two configurations have similar microscopic dynamics and hence remain similar at later times .",
    "note however that this assumption has to hold in the conventional continuum definition as well , and therefore does not put additional restrictions on our model . in fact , if two initially similar configurations evolve very differently , one must abandon the continuum limit and follow the specific microscopic configuration of interest , using discrete dynamics .",
    "we now derive the evolution equation for the continuous height , @xmath11 , at position @xmath9 and time @xmath12 . as a basis for the derivation we assume knowledge of the discrete equations of motion for the underlying step flow model .",
    "these equations of motion specify the normal velocity of a step that passes through @xmath13 as a function of the local step configuration .",
    "we denote this dependency by writing @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the configuration of steps in the region that influences the step velocity at @xmath13 . in most models of step flow this region of influence",
    "covers a small number of neighboring steps .",
    "note that in the context of the discrete step model , @xmath15 is the actual configuration of steps in the system .",
    "when going to the continuum we will be interested in the ensemble of configurations @xmath16 which are consistent with @xmath11 .",
    "the continuous height @xmath11 changes with time due to the flow of steps through @xmath9 , and due to nucleation and annihilation of steps . at this stage",
    "we disregard nucleation processes and include them later .",
    "first , we consider positions which are not local extrema of the height profile .",
    "it is obvious from the construction of the configurational continuum , that for each point @xmath9 there is exactly one configuration @xmath15 in the ensemble , which has a step that passes through @xmath9 at time @xmath12 .",
    "that step lies along the unique equal - height contour line , which passes through @xmath9 . as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ensemble ] , the exact positions of neighboring steps in the configuration @xmath15 can be calculated from the knowledge of @xmath11 , and the fact that in this configuration there is a step at @xmath9 . hence , we can use the discrete step model eq .",
    "( [ general_step_flow ] ) and calculate the normal velocity of the step @xmath17 .",
    "note that at different positions , @xmath17 is the normal velocity of steps which may belong to _ different _ configurations in the ensemble .    next we define the directional gradient in the direction from which steps flow towards @xmath9 @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "this is useful for the calculation of the current of steps arriving at @xmath9 : @xmath20 where we have used the fact that the local step density is @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath22 is the current of steps belonging to all configurations in the ensemble , and not to one particular configuration . since each step ( from any configuration ) , which passes through @xmath9 changes the height of the ensemble envelope by @xmath6 , the continuous height profile obeys the evolution equation @xmath23    the above derivation of the evolution in the continuum is not valid at local extrema of the surface , because generally one can not define a unique equal - height contour line which passes through such a point . to avoid the problem",
    ", we define @xmath24 at local extrema as the limit of the height time derivative as one approaches these points .",
    "this limiting procedure is justified , since there are no microscopic realizations of the surface with steps exactly at the local extrema .",
    "at this point we emphasize that the configurational continuum evolution is formally identical to the evolution of the discrete step model .",
    "this statement is almost trivial , since the definition of eq .",
    "( [ dynamic_equation ] ) follows the envelope of the ensemble of configurations , and each configuration evolves with step velocities calculated from the discrete step model . thus eq.([dynamic_equation ] ) is exact .",
    "moreover , the use of directional derivatives in the derivation of eq.([dynamic_equation ] ) makes it valid even at singular surface regions such as corners or facet edges .",
    "similarly to other continuum models it is solved numerically by discretization of space , which is the only approximation involved in such solutions .",
    "what is the relation between configurational continuum and conventional continuum models ? in regions where @xmath11 is analytic , the evolution equation ( [ dynamic_equation ] ) reduces to the continuity equation @xmath25 if @xmath11 is sufficiently smooth , @xmath17 can be approximated as a local function of @xmath26 and its spatial derivatives , as is commonly done in conventional continuum models .",
    "making this approximation will therefore recover the conventional continuum approach .",
    "we can conclude that in analytic surface regions the conventional continuum approach approximates the configurational continuum model and that the approximation quality depends on the smoothness of the surface .",
    "however , near corners , facets or regions where the profile is not smooth , one can not reconstruct the microscopic step configuration from the local value of @xmath26 and its spatial derivatives . in these regions",
    "@xmath17 contains non local information and as a result eq.([dynamic_equation ] ) can not even be written as a differential equation .",
    "is there any computational gain in using such a continuum model ?",
    "after all , we replaced a discrete model , which follows the evolution of a single microscopic step configuration , by a model which follows a whole ensemble of step configurations .",
    "the key point is that we do not have to follow all the steps of all configurations . to calculate @xmath27 ,",
    "it is enough to locally follow the single configuration which has a step that passes trough @xmath9 at time @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the continuum evolution equation is solved on a grid , and the density of grid points can be very small in regions where the continuous height profile is smooth .",
    "the smoothness of the profile allows very accurate interpolation between these points .",
    "only near singular points or lines we have to use a rather dense grid , and there is no computational gain in these regions . in practice",
    ", the total number of grid points used can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of points one has to use in order to follow the evolution of a single microscopic step configuration .",
    "so far we ignored the possibility of island or void nucleation .",
    "it is possible to include island or void nucleation in our model provided that we have a microscopic description for these events which determines the nucleation probability in a given step configuration . within our continuum approach ,",
    "the nucleation probability at a point on the continuous surface is the ensemble average of the microscopic nucleation probabilities at this point . for demonstration",
    "proposes we consider a simple model where the probability for the nucleation of an island on a terrace grows as the square of the local concentration of diffusing adatoms .",
    "information regarding the values of terrace adatom concentrations is already contained in the underlying step flow model eq.([general_step_flow ] ) , since it is used in the calculation of adatom fluxes into and out of steps .",
    "we now apply our approach to a few simple cases .",
    "first , we consider a conic structure which consists of circular concentric steps .",
    "this crystalline cone was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where we wrote a one - dimensional step flow model for the step radii in the absence of growth flux . in the diffusion limited case where adatom diffusion across terraces is the rate limiting process , the equation of motion for the step radii @xmath28 read : @xmath29 with the step chemical potentials @xmath30 given by @xmath31\\;. \\label{cone_step_chemical_potential}\\ ] ] in the above expressions @xmath32 is the adatom diffusion constant , @xmath33 is the atomic area of the crystal and @xmath34 is the equilibrium concentration in the vicinity of a straight isolated step .",
    "@xmath35 is the step line tension , @xmath36 is the step - step interaction strength , @xmath37 is the temperature and @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "eq.([cone_step_chemical_potential ] ) can be used for calculating the chemical potential of the top step , @xmath39 , by omitting the second interaction term .",
    "numerical integration of the above step model shows that the cone decays through the collapse of individual islands . during the decay a facet develops at the top of the cone with a radius that grows with time as @xmath40 .",
    "similar equations can be written in the presence of growth flux .",
    "with flux , the cone grows except at the peak which initially decays and then saturates . a facet forms at the peak after saturation .",
    "the continuum model we solved in the context of this example is a fully two dimensional model , which can , in principle , develop non radially symmetric morphologies .",
    "the microscopic dynamics we used were a two dimensional generalization of the microscopic equations for step radii of the discrete one dimensional model given above .",

    "the equations describing adatom diffusion on terraces were solved assuming the steps at @xmath9 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are circular and concentric and that the radius of the step at @xmath9 is @xmath47 .",
    "any microscopic dynamics , such as a full solution of the diffusion equation on each terrace , or a more detailed calculation of the interactions between steps can easily be used in the framework of our model . for the sake of demonstrating the validity of configurational continuum the simple dynamics we chose are sufficient .",
    "figure [ cone_decay ] shows a comparison between a numerical solution of the discrete step model and a cross section from the two dimensional solution of our continuum model in the absence of growth flux and when nucleation of new steps is not allowed .",
    "clearly the continuum model captures the main features of the surface evolution .",
    "in particular the width and height of the top facet are in excellent agreement with the discrete model .",
    "[ growing_cone ] shows a similar comparison in the presence of growth flux .",
    "again the agreement is quite impressive . in this case",
    "we allowed new islands to nucleate and our simulation indicates that nucleation events occur on the top facet once it becomes large enough .",
    "there is hardly any nucleation on the finite slope regions , because the steps there efficiently absorb the excess material .",
    "figure [ growing_cone](c ) shows an island on the top facet , which nucleated and started growing .",
    "we now turn to the more demanding example of bidirectional sinusoidal grating relaxation . here",

    "the quality of the data collapse shows that the scaling scenario ( [ shape_scaling ] ) holds very accurately .",

    "this shape does not agree with rettori and villain s heuristic argument @xcite , which predicts that facets appear also near @xmath56 lines .",
    "nevertheless , their prediction that after a short transient the amplitude of the height profile decays as @xmath57 is in agreement with both eq .  ( [ shape_scaling ] ) and our numerical solutions .",

    "fig.[high_g_egg ] ( a ) shows profiles of different wavelengths which have relaxed to half of the initial amplitude . here",
    "profiles with a smaller wavelength have small facets and moderate slopes .",
    "this happens because repulsion between steps becomes increasingly important as the profile wavelength is reduced . at long wavelengths the weak step - step interaction limit of fig.[low_g_egg ]",
