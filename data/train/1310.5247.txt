    "they highlight confinement effects which eventually modify the electronic band structure @xcite .",
    "one of the main concerns when fabricating this kind of samples is that pure ni inclusions can remain within the crystal , thus yielding a non - zero magnetic moment .    in this work ,",

    "a magnetic transition at this temperature involving the whole sample should give an overwhelming contribution to the specific heat@xcite .",

    "the magnetization curves remain similar as in fig .  5 , without additional irreversibility .",
    "thus , the ferromagnetic signal does not produce a strong pinning effect .",
    "this is compatible with the soft magnetic features and reminds the situation found in permalloy - superconductor nanostructures@xcite .",
    "we measured the magnetization of the nibi@xmath0 crystals up to 700 k to search for eventual high - temperature disapperance of the ferromagnetic signal ( fig .",
    "we find indeed a jump and change of slope at t = 525 k with no further transition until 700 k. the curie temperature of crystalline ni is at t@xmath38 = 631 k. thus , the magnetic component is not due to crystalline ni inclusions .",
    "the lack of peaks in x - ray scattering from crystalline ni implies that there are no crystallized ni impurities larger that the x - ray coherence lenght of a few 100  .",

    "curves we find , at the same time , superconducting and ferromagnetic signals .",
    "we have shown that the ferromagnetic signal seen in the magnetization experiments stems from amorphous ni inclusions in the superconducting nibi@xmath0 matrix .",
