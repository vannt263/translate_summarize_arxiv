    "although stringent limits on the existence of sterile states with large mixing to standard neutrinos have been obtained from cosmological big - bang nucleosynthesis considerations @xcite , more conservative estimations claim that the relevant effective number of light neutrino degrees of freedom may still allow or even exceed @xmath17  @xcite , thus not precluding scenarios such as given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , nucleosynthesis bounds might be evaded due to the possible suppression of active - sterile neutrino conversions in the early universe due to the presence of a lepton asymmetry that can be generated by the oscillations themselves  @xcite .",

    "[ chimin1 ] we plot the minimum value attained by the @xmath71 function for fixed @xmath4 as @xmath97 is varied freely , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "notice that for large @xmath98 ev@xmath99 , the @xmath71 is nearly constant .",
    "this happens because in this limit the contribution of the matter potential in eq  ( [ evolution1 ] ) can be neglected with respect to the @xmath3 term , so that the matter effect disappears and moreover , the oscillation effect is averaged out . in fact one can see that in this range we obtain nearly the same @xmath71 for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases . for very small @xmath100 ev@xmath99 , the situation is opposite , namely the matter term dominates and we obtain a better fit for the @xmath1 channel , as can be seen by comparing the @xmath101 curve of the super - kamiokande sub - gev data ( dotted curve in the left panel of fig .  [ chimin1 ] ) with the solid ( @xmath68 ) and dashed ( @xmath23 ) curves in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ chimin1 ] is obtained by combining sub and multi - gev data .    a last point worth commenting",
    "is that for the @xmath102 case in the sub - gev sample there are two almost degenerate values of @xmath4 for which @xmath71 attains a minimum . from fig .",
    "[ chimin1 ] one sees that the corresponding oscillation parameter values are @xmath103 ev@xmath99 and @xmath104ev@xmath99 , both with maximal mixing . for the multi - gev case",

    "one can notice that the matter effects are similar for the upper right and lower right panels because matter effects enhance the oscillations for _ neutrinos _ in both cases .",
    "in contrast , in the case of @xmath2 with @xmath66 the enhancement occurs only for _ anti - neutrinos _ while in this case the effect of matter suppresses the conversion in @xmath10 s .",
    "since the yield of atmospheric neutrinos is bigger than that of atmospheric anti - neutrinos , clearly the matter effect suppresses the overall conversion probability .",
    "therefore we need in this case a larger value of the vacuum mixing angle , as can be seen by comparing the left and right lower panels in fig .",
    "[ mutausk1 ] .",
    "notice that in all channels where matter effects play a role ( all , except the upper left panel ) the range of acceptable @xmath4 is shifted towards larger values , when compared with the @xmath18 case .",
    "this follows from looking at the relation between mixing _ in vacuo _ and in matter @xcite .",
    "in fact , whenever the magnitude of the matter potential is much larger than the difference between the two energy eigenvalues in vacuum , i.e. , when @xmath109 , there is a suppression of the mixing inside the earth , irrespective of the sign of the matter potential and/or @xmath4 . as a result , there is a lower cut in the allowed @xmath4 value , and it lies higher than what is obtained in the data fit for the @xmath5 channel . for example , let us consider the cases of @xmath5 and @xmath2 for @xmath110 .",
    "one can see comparing the upper left and lower right panels that the values of @xmath4 for @xmath111 channel for the sub - gev sample at 90% cl are in the range from @xmath112ev@xmath99 to @xmath113ev@xmath99 , whereas for the @xmath114 channel they are in the range from @xmath115ev@xmath99 to @xmath116ev@xmath99 .",

    "the quality of these fits can be better appreciated from tables  [ tab : data1 ] and  [ tab : data2 ] . comparing the values of @xmath117 obtained in the present work with those of ref .",
    "@xcite we see that the allowed region is relatively stable with respect to the increased super - kamiokande statistics .",
    "however , in contrast to the case for 325.8 days , now the @xmath114 channel is as good as the @xmath118 , when only the sub - gev sample is included , with a clear super - kamiokande preference for the @xmath114 channel .",
    "as before , the combined sub - gev and multi - gev data prefers the @xmath119 , where @xmath120 or _ sterile _ , over the @xmath121 solution .",
    "the zenith angle distribution changes in the presence of oscillations and it is different for each channel . the main information supportive of the oscillation hypothesis comes from the multi - gev muon data of super - kamiokande , shown in the upper right panel of fig .  [ ang_mu ] .",
    "one can see that the zenith angle distribution of the electron data is roughly consistent with the no - oscillation hypothesis . to conclude this section we now turn to the predicted zenith angle distributions for the various oscillation channels . as an example we take the case of the super - kamiokande experiment and",
    "compare separately the sub - gev and multi - gev data with what is predicted in the case of no - oscillation ( thick solid histogram ) and in all oscillation channels for the corresponding best fit points obtained for the _ combined _ sub and multi - gev data analysis performed above ( all other histograms ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ ang_mu ] . in the upper left ( right )",

    "[ ang_mu ] we give the same information for the electron data . in the case of oscillations between two neutrino species",
    "the only relevant channel to compare to in this case is the @xmath7 channel .",

    "[ ang_mu ] .",
    "clearly the zenith distribution predicted in the no oscillation case is symmetrical in the zenith angle very much in disagreement with the data .",
    "in the presence of @xmath7 oscillations the asymmetry in the distribution is much smaller than in the @xmath5 or @xmath2 channels , as seen from the figure .",
    "we now turn to the comparison of the information obtained from the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data presented above with the results from reactor and accelerator experiments as well as the sensitivities of future experiments . for this purpose",

    "the first important point is that from the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] one sees that the chooz reactor  @xcite data already exclude completely the allowed region for the @xmath118 channel when all experiments are combined at 90% cl .",

    "the region obtained ( upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ mutausk3 ] ) is not completely excluded by chooz at 90% cl .",
    "present accelerator experiments are not very sensitive to low @xmath4 due to their short baseline . as a result , for all channels other than @xmath121 the present limits on neutrino oscillation parameters from cdhsw @xcite , chorus and nomad @xcite are fully consistent with the region indicated by the atmospheric neutrino analysis .",
    "future long baseline ( lbl ) experiments have been advocated as a way to independently check the ana .",
    "using different tests such long - baseline experiments now planned at kek ( k2k ) @xcite , fermilab ( minos ) @xcite and cern ( icarus @xcite , noe @xcite , and opera @xcite ) would test the pattern of neutrino oscillations well beyond the reach of present experiments .",
    "these tests are the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath123 appearance searches 2 .",
    "the @xmath124 ratio , @xmath125 .",
    "this is the most sensitive test , namely the ratio of the ratios between the total neutral current events over charged current events in a near detector over a far detector .",
    "for example the curves labelled _ nc / cc ratio _ at the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] delimit the sensitivity regions of these experiments with respect to this test . 3 .   the muon disappearance , @xmath126 .",
    "this test is based on the comparison between the number of charged current interactions in a near detector and those measured in the far detector .",
    "for example , the curves labelled _ disappearance _ at the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] delimit the sensitivity regions of the relevant experiments with respect to this test .",
    "the second test can potentially discriminate between the active and sterile channels , i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "however it can not discriminate between @xmath2 and the no - oscillation hypothesis .",
    "in contrast , the last test can probe the oscillation hypothesis itself .",
    "notice that the sensitivity curves corresponding to the disappearance test labelled as _ kek - sk disappearance _ at the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] are the same for the @xmath5 and the sterile channel since the average energy of kek - sk is too low to produce a tau - lepton in the far detector  .",
    "in contrast the minos experiment has a higher average initial neutrino energy and it can see the tau s .",
    "although in this case the exclusion curves corresponding to the disappearance test are in principle different for the different oscillation channels , in practice , however , the sensitivity plot is dominated by the systematic error . as a result discriminating between @xmath101 and @xmath2 would be unlikely with the disappearance test@xcite .",
    "in summary we find that , unfortunately , the regions of oscillation parameters obtained from the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data on vertex - contained events can not be fully tested by the lbl experiments , when the super - kamiokande data are included in the fit for the @xmath18 channel as can be seen clearly from the upper - left panel of fig .  [ mutausk4 ] .",
    "one might expect that , due to the upward shift of the @xmath4 indicated by the fit for the sterile case , it would be possible to completely cover the corresponding region of oscillation parameters .",
    "this is the case for the minos disappearance test .",
    "but in general since only the disappearance test can discriminate against the no - oscillation hypothesis , and this test is intrinsically weaker due to systematics , we find that also for the sterile case most of the lbl experiments can not completely probe the region of oscillation parameters indicated by the atmospheric neutrino analysis .",
    "this is so irrespective of the sign of @xmath4 : the lower - left panel in fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] shows the @xmath2 channel with @xmath66 while the @xmath68 case with @xmath106 is shown in the lower - right panel .",
    "in this paper we have compared the relative quality of the active - active and active - sterile channels as potential explanations of the ana using the recent 535 days sample of super - kamiokande as well all available atmospheric neutrino data in the sub gev and multi gev range ( vertex - contained events ) . using the most recent theoretical atmospheric neutrino fluxes we have determined the allowed regions of oscillation parameters for @xmath127 for all possible channels @xmath128 .",
    "we find that the @xmath4 values for the active - sterile oscillations ( both for positive and negative @xmath3 ) are higher than for the @xmath5 case .",

    "we find a slight preference for the @xmath5 channel over the other channels , including @xmath23 .",
    "insofar as the @xmath7 channel is concerned , there is no great change in the presently allowed region of all combined experiments with respect to the earlier situation : it is completely excluded by the chooz experiment at the 90 % cl . what is new is that the @xmath23 fit for 535 days is now worse than with the smaller sample and slightly disfavoured when in the global fit of atmospheric data _ alone _ and more strongly disfavoured if super - kamiokande data alone are combined .",
    "we also give the zenith angle distributions predicted for the best fit points for each of the possible oscillation channel . using the zenith angle distribution expected for multi - gev super - kamiokande data in the presence of oscillation we compare the relative goodness of the three possible oscillation channels .",
    "this allows one to understand clearly why the @xmath5 and @xmath2 channels are much better than the @xmath23 channel which is in any case ruled out by chooz . the main support for the to oscillation hypothesis comes from the super - kamiokande multi - gev muon data .",
