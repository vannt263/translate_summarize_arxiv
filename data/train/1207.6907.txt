    "the investigation of matrix versions of the hamburger moment problem was initiated in the second half of the 1940 s by m.  g.  krein ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "mainly , based on new approaches ( v.  p.  potapov s method of fundamental matrix inequalities , reproducing kernel hilbert spaces , schur analysis ) a renaissance of this topic could be observed in the last three decades ( see e.g.  the papers kovalishina  @xcite , katsnelson  @xcite , dym  @xcite , bolotnikov  @xcite , chen / hu  @xcite and the monographs sakhnovich  @xcite and bakonyi / woerdeman  @xcite ) .",
    "this paper continues the authors investigations on matricial versions of the truncated hamburger moment problem ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it was inspired by the recent work by v.  a.  derkach , s.  hassi and h.  s.  v.  de  snoo on indefinite versions of truncated moment problems in the class of scalar generalized nevanlinna functions ( see  @xcite ) . as a byproduct they obtained a result ( see  @xcite * ) which seems to be new even for the odd truncated scalar hamburger moment problem .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 is a non - negative integer and if @xmath1 is a sequence of real numbers such that the hankel matrix @xmath2 is positive hermitian , then the set of of all solutions of the hamburger moment problem corresponding to the sequence @xmath1 could be parametrized with the aid of a linear fractional transformation the generating matrix - valued function of which is a polynomial built from the sequence @xmath1 .",
    "the role of the set of parameter functions was taken by a particular subclass of the class of all functions which are holomorphic in the open upper half plane of the complex plane and have a non - negative imaginary part at each point .",
    "the study of such classes of holomorphic functions was initiated by i.  s.  kats in  @xcite and then continued by s.  hassi , h.  s.  v.  de  snoo and a.  d.  i.  willemsma ( see  @xcite ) . using several results originating in the just mentioned papers , v.  a.  derkach ,",
    "s.  hassi and h.  s.  v.  de  snoo  @xcite were able to derive new hamburger - nevanlinna type theorems which played an important role in their approach to the moment problems for generalized nevanlinna functions .",
    "another cornerstone in the approach of v.  a.  derkach , s.  hassi and h.  s.  v.  de  snoo  @xcite is the application of the schur - chebyshev recursion algorithm , studied in the nondegenerate situation by m.  derevyagin  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to generalize the assertion of  @xcite * to the matrix case without assuming some conditions of nondegeneracy . roughly speaking",
    ", our strategy to realize this plan is modelled in basic steps along the lines of the approach in  @xcite .",
    "we will use a lot of results from the recent paper  @xcite on various classes of holomorphic matrix - valued functions , which are generalizations of the scalar theory obtained in  @xcite .",
    "a further basic element in our approach is to use new hamburger - nevanlinna type theorems for matrix - valued holomorphic functions which will be derived in .",
    "an other central feature of our approach is the use of schur analysis methods .",
    "we will apply two interrelated versions of matricial schur type algorithms , namely an algebraic one and a function - theoretic one .",
    "the algebraic version was worked out in  @xcite .",
    "it is an algorithm which is applied to a finite or infinite sequences of complex .",
    "an essential feature of this algorithm is that it preserves several properties of block hankel matrices built from the sequences of complex under consideration ( see ) .",
    "the construction and investigation of the function - theoretic version of our schur type algorithm is a central theme of this paper .",
    "this algorithm will be applied to relevant classes of holomorphic matrix - valued functions in the open upper half plane . in the scalar case ,",
    "this algorithm coincides with the classical algorithm which was constructed by r.  nevanlinna  @xcite in adaptation of the classical schur algorithm for bounded holomorphic functions , which is due to i.  schur  @xcite .",
    "the idea how to build the algorithm in the matrix case was inspired by some constructions in the paper  @xcite by chen and hu .",
    "an essential point of our approach is an intensive use of the interplay between the function - theoretic and algebraic versions of our matricial schur type algorithms .",
    "both algorithms are formulated in terms of moore - penrose inverses of matrices .",
    "what concerns the function - theoretic version , it can be said that its effectiveness is mostly caused by recent results from  @xcite on the holomorphicity of the moore - penrose inverse of special classes of holomorphic matrix - valued functions .    in order to describe more concretely the central topics studied in this paper ,",
    "we introduce some notation . throughout this paper ,",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be positive integers .",
    "let @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 be the set of all positive integers , the set of all non - negative integers , the set of all integers , the set of all real numbers , and the set of all complex numbers , respectively . for every choice of @xmath10 , let @xmath11 .",
    "we will write @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for the set of all complex , the set of all hermitian complex , the set of all non - negative hermitian complex , and the set of all positive hermitian complex , respectively .    we will use @xmath16 to denote the @xmath17-algebra of all borel subsets of @xmath8 . for",

    ". we will use the integration theory with respect to non - negative hermitian which was worked out independently by i.  s.  kats  @xcite and m.  rosenberg  @xcite . for all @xmath22 ,",

    "furthermore , we set @xmath26 .    if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then it can be verified , as in the scalar case , that the inclusion @xmath29 holds true .",
    "the central problem in this paper is the truncated version of the following power moment problem of hamburger type :    let @xmath30 and let @xmath31 be a sequence of complex .",
    "describe the set @xmath32 of all @xmath33 for which @xmath34}=\\su{j}$ ] is fulfilled for all @xmath35 .",
    "there is a further matricial version of the truncated hamburger moment problem :    let @xmath36 and let @xmath37 be a sequence of complex . describe the set @xmath38 of all @xmath39 for which @xmath40 is satisfied for each @xmath41 whereas the matrix @xmath42 is non - negative hermitian .    the first investigation of goes back to i.  v.  kovalishina  @xcite who used v.  p.  potapov s method of fundamental matrix inequalities .",
    "in the nondegenerate case , she obtained in  @xcite * a complete description of the stieltjes transforms of the solution set of in terms of a linear fractional transformation .",
    "an extension of v.  p.  potapov s method to degenerate situations was worked out by v.  k.  dubovoj ( see  @xcite ) for the case of the matricial schur problem . using a modification of v.  k.  dubovoj s method , could be handled by v.  a.  bolotnikov ( see  @xcite * ) in the degenerate case . a common method of solving simultaneously",
    "the nondegenerate and degenerate versions of was presented by chen and hu in  @xcite .",
    "their method is based on the use of a matricial schur type algorithm involving matrix - valued continued fractions .    what concerns the investigation of interrelations between the two moment problems under consideration ,",
    "we refer the reader to the papers  @xcite . a detailed treatment of the history of these two moment problems is contained in the introduction to the paper  @xcite .",
    "in order to state a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of each of the above formulated moment problems , we have to recall the notion of two types of sequences of matrices .",
    "if @xmath43 and if @xmath37 is a sequence of complex , then @xmath37 is called _ hankel non - negative definite _ if the block hankel matrix @xmath44 is non - negative hermitian .",

    "the goal of our paper here is to give a parametrization of the solution set of problem in the case that @xmath63 is an odd integer ( see ) .",
    "as already mentioned above in the scalar case @xmath65 , such a description of the solution set of problem with odd integer @xmath66 was given by derkach , hassi , and de snoo  @xcite*. during the work at the odd case we observed that a slight modification of our approach also works for the even case .",
