    "in 3-dimensional space , indistinguishable particles obey fermi - dirac statistics ( fermions ) , or bose - einstein statistics ( bosons ) . for both fermions and bosons , upon the exchange of two indistinguishable particles ,",

    "however , when restricted to 2-dimensional space , particles appear to obey fractional statistics@xcite .",
    "this means that when two indistinguishable particles in 2-dimensional space are exchanged , the system wave function gains a statistical phase change , ranging continuously from @xmath5 to @xmath4 .",
    "those quasiparticles are defined as anyons .",
    "anyons can be grouped in abelian and nonabelian anyons .",

    "recently , the interest in anyons is enhanced by the developing field of quantum computing because of their potential ability to impliment fault - tolerant quantum computing architecture .",
    "several theoretical schemes have been proposed to directly observe the fractional statistics associated with the anyon braiding motion@xcite .",
    "these schemes are mainly grouped into two approaches : the first is proposed to be realized in fqh systems , and the second makes use of the kitaev models . in fqh systems , it is difficult to directly observe anyonic fractional statistics , and to introduce or resolve individual anyons@xcite when compared with the schemes using the kitaev spin lattice models .",
    "experimental demonstrations in photon systems using the kitaev spin lattice models have been realized@xcite .",
    "however the anyons are not protected from local noise and there is no explicit particle interpretation of the excitations@xcite because the background hamiltonian vanishes in such photon systems .",

    "the difference between the two @xmath132 values in the simulation is small , which means decoherence did not contribute much to the deviation of @xmath136 from @xmath0 .",
    "the deviation was mainly caused by imperfections of the refocusing protocols and the implementation of rf pulses .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated the anyonic fractional statistics , using a 7-qubit nmr system .",
    "this is the first demonstration on topological quantum computing using nuclear spins .",
    "one advantage of our experimental scheme is that we can use the same technique to simulate a 9-qubit kitaev spin model mentioned by han et al.@xcite using an nmr system with more spins , so that we can do a demonstration that anyonic operation is robust to different braiding paths and thus taking an important step towards showing the fault tolerance properties of the kitaev model .",
