    "totally unimodular ( tu ) matrices form an important class of matrices for integer and linear programming due to the integrality properties of the associated polyhedron . a matrix @xmath2 is _ totally unimodular _",
    "if each square submatrix of @xmath2 has determinant @xmath3 or @xmath4 . the class of tu matrices has been studied extensively and combinatorial characterizations for these matrices can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an important subclass of tu matrices is defined as follows .",
    "a matrix @xmath2 is _ strongly unimodular _ ( su ) if : ( i ) @xmath2 is tu , and ( ii ) every matrix obtained from @xmath2 setting a @xmath5 entry to @xmath6 is also tu .",
    "strongly unimodular matrices have appeared several times in the literature @xcite since they were first introduced in @xcite .",
    "another subclass of tu matrices discussed in this paper is the class of network matrices .",
    "a _ network matrix _ may be viewed as an edge - path matrix of a directed graph with respect to a particular tree of the graph ; results regarding network matrices can be found in  @xcite .",
    "seymour has shown in  @xcite that network matrices and their transposes are the main building blocks for tu matrices . in this paper we show that su matrices are closed under @xmath0-sum operations for @xmath1 implying a decomposition into smaller su matrices representing @xmath7-connected regular matroids , for which matrices we provide a characterization .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_ksm ] , we show that su matrices are closed under the @xmath0-sum operations @xmath8 and thereby , they can be decomposed into smaller su matrices via these operations .",
    "the special structure of these smaller matrices is discussed in section  [ sec_3c ] .",
    "finally , we assume that the reader is aware of basic notions of graph theory and matroid theory .",
    "our references for graph theory are  @xcite and for matroid theory are  @xcite .",
    "the following two results ( lemmata  [ lem_ew ] and  [ lem_su22 ] ) can be obtained easily from the definition of su matrices and the fact that tu matrices are closed under deletions of rows and columns .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ lem_ew ] is straightforward and is ommited .",
    "[ lem_ew ] every submatrix of a strongly unimodular matrix is strongly unimodular .",
    "[ lem_su22 ] a @xmath9 tu matrix having at most two nonzeros in every column ( row ) is su .",
    "let @xmath2 be a tu matrix with at most two nonzeros in every column .",
    "the case in which @xmath2 has two nonzeros in every row can be handled in much the same way .",
    "let us change a nonzero of column @xmath10 of @xmath2 and call @xmath11 the matrix so - obtained . now every submatrix of @xmath11 either is equal to the corresponding submatrix of @xmath2 ; or we can expand the determinant of the submatrix of @xmath11 along column @xmath10 ( which has one nonzero being @xmath5 ) and observe that the determinant of @xmath11 is actually equal , up to @xmath5 scaling , to the determinant of a submatrix of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in all cases the determinant of any submatrix of @xmath11 is @xmath9 and therefore @xmath2 is su .    as shown in the following result , strongly unimodular matrices are closed under some matrix operations .",
    "[ lem_opra ] strongly unimodular matrices are closed under the following operations :    * transposing , * adding a zero row or column , * adding a unit column or a unit row , and * repeating a column or a row    part ( i ) is trivial since the determinant of any submatrix remains unchanged under transposing . for",
    "( ii ) , the addition of a zero column ( row ) to a matrix @xmath2 results to a matrix @xmath11 which is tu , since tu matrices are closed under the addition of a zero column ( row ) . furthermore",
    ", the replacement of any nonzero of @xmath11 by a zero has to take place to the submatrix @xmath2 of it .",
    "but @xmath2 is su and therefore we have that the matrix so - obtained is a tu matrix plus a zero column ( row ) .",
    "the result now follows from the fact that tu matrices are closed under the addition of a zero row ( column ) .    for ( iii ) , let s add a unit column @xmath12 to an su matrix @xmath2 and let s call",
    "@xmath13 $ ] the matrix so - obtained .",
    "the case in which a unit row is added can be handled similarly .",
    "if we change the nonzero of column @xmath12 to zero then this is equivalent of adding a zero row to a tu matrix and therefore the matrix so - obtained remains tu .",
    "if we change any other nonzero of @xmath11 to zero then this has to be an element of the part @xmath2 of @xmath11 ; we change such a nonzero to zero and we call @xmath14 $ ] the new matrix",
    ". we shall show that any submatrix of @xmath15 is tu .",
    "obviously , any submatrix of @xmath16 is tu because @xmath2 is an su matrix . in the remaining case",
    ", we can expand the determinant of a submatrix along column @xmath12 and observe that this determinant is a @xmath5 multiple of the determinant of a submatrix of @xmath16",
    ".    for ( iv ) , let @xmath17 $ ] be an su matrix and let @xmath18 be a column of @xmath11 which we repeat in order to construct the matrix @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we note here that the case of repeating a row can be handled in the same way .",
    "the only case which has to be examined is the one in which a nonzero element of a column @xmath18 becomes zero , since for all the other cases all the submatrices of the matrix obtained are easily checked to be tu .",
    "let @xmath20 be the matrix obtained from turning a nonzero of a column @xmath18 to zero , then the only submatrices of @xmath21 $ ] which has to be examined of being tu are those containing parts of column @xmath20 and @xmath18 , since all the other submatrices are trivially tu .",
    "expanding now the determinant of such a submatrix of @xmath15 along the column @xmath20 and also expand the determinant of the same submatrix of @xmath22 $ ] along @xmath18 we see that these two determinants differ by a determinant of a tu matrix .",
    "thus , these determinants differ by @xmath6 or @xmath5 . but the determinant of the submatrix of @xmath22 $ ] is equal to zero and therefore we have that the determinant of the corresponding submatrix of @xmath15 is either @xmath6 or @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath0-sum operations @xmath23 on matrices are of central importance for our work and are defined as follows :    [ def_k - sums ] if @xmath24 are matrices , @xmath25 are column vectors and @xmath26 are row vectors of appropriate size in @xmath27 then    1-sum : : :    @xmath28 2-sum : : :    @xmath29 3-sum : : :    @xmath30 or +    @xmath31 +    where , in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and    @xmath34 are @xmath35-independent row vectors    and @xmath12 and @xmath36 are    @xmath35-independent column vectors such that    @xmath37=[d_1|\\bar{d}]$ ] ,    @xmath38=[\\frac{\\bar{d}}{d_2}]$ ] and @xmath39 is    a square non - singular matrix",
    ". then ,    @xmath40\\bar{d}^{-1}[\\frac{b}{c}]$ ] .",
    "we show that su matrices are closed under the @xmath41-sum and @xmath42-sum operations .",
    "[ lem_1-s ] if @xmath2 and @xmath16 are su matrices then the matrix @xmath43 is an su matrix .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath16 are tu and from the fact that tu matrices are closed under @xmath41-sums we have that @xmath44 is tu .",
    "it remains to be shown that if we change a nonzero of the submatrix @xmath2 ( or @xmath16 ) of @xmath44 to zero then the matrix @xmath45 obtained by this change is tu .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath16 are su we have that @xmath11 and @xmath46 are tu and from the fact that tu matrices are closed under the @xmath41-sum operation we have that @xmath47 is tu as well .",
    "[ lem_2-s ] if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are su matrices then the matrix @xmath50 is an su matrix .",
    "since tu matrices are closed under @xmath42-sums we have that the matrix @xmath44 , which is the @xmath42-sum of the tu matrices @xmath2 and @xmath16 , is tu .",
    "it remains to be shown that changing a nonzero of @xmath44 to zero the matrix @xmath47 so - obtained is also tu .",
    "we consider the following two cases separately : ( i ) we replace a nonzero of the submatrix @xmath11 or @xmath46 of @xmath44 by zero , and ( ii ) we replace a nonzero element of the @xmath51 submatrix of @xmath44 by zero .    for case ( i )",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that we change a nonzero element of @xmath11 to zero and let us call @xmath52 the matrix so - obtained ( the case in which a nonzero element of @xmath46 is changed is similar ) .",
    "therefore , matrix @xmath53 is the @xmath42-sum of the matrix @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath54 is a tu matrix since it is obtained from the su matrix @xmath2 by replacement of a nonzero by a zero , and @xmath55 is tu since it is equal to matrix @xmath16 . from the fact that tu matrices are closed under @xmath42-sums",
    "the result follows .    for case ( ii )",
    ", let @xmath47 be the matrix obtained from changing a nonzero of the @xmath51 part of @xmath44 to zero .",

    "initially , we can see that @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath18 contains the nonzero having changed and thus differs from column @xmath12 only to that element ; furthermore , we assume that @xmath57 is the first column of @xmath46 and @xmath58 is the rest of it , i.e. @xmath59 $ ] , and that @xmath16 is the matrix having as first row the vector @xmath60 $ ] , where the first element of this vector has to be @xmath41 otherwise we could not find a nonzero to change in order to create @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath47 is the @xmath7-sum of the following two matrices @xmath62\\ ] ]    @xmath63\\ ] ] since tu matrices closed under @xmath7-sums it suffices to show that each of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is tu .",
    "we know that @xmath66 $ ] is su because of lemma  [ lem_opra ]  ( iv ) ; moreover , from ( iii ) of the same lemma we have that @xmath67      $ ] is su . finally , applying again ( iv ) of lemma  [ lem_opra ] we have that @xmath68      $ ] is su",
    ". thus , changing a specific nonzero from a column @xmath69 $ ] of @xmath70 to zero we obtain @xmath64 which has to be tu .",
    "we know that @xmath16 is su , so by lemma  [ lem_opra ] , we have that the matrix @xmath71 $ ] is su .",
    "thus , replacing a @xmath41 of a column @xmath72 $ ] of @xmath73 we obtain matrix @xmath65 which has to be tu .",
