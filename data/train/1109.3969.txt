    "the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) @xcite is one of standard tools of nuclear theory which offers considerable potential for further development .",
    "built on lorentz covariance and the dirac equation , it provides a natural incorporation of spin degrees of freedom  @xcite and an accurate description of spin - orbit splittings  @xcite ( see also fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which has an essential influence on the underlying shell structure . note that the spin - orbit interaction is a relativistic effect , which arises naturally in the cdft theory .",
    "lorentz covariance of the cdft equations leads to the fact that time - odd mean fields of this theory are determined as spatial components of lorentz vectors and therefore coupled with the same constants as time - like components  @xcite which are fitted to ground state properties of finite nuclei .",
    "in addition , pseudo - spin symmetry finds a natural explanation in the relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "cdft in its different incarnations both on the mean field and beyond mean field levels provides succesful description of many properties of ground state and excited configurations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of applications of cdft have been focused on collective properties of nuclei .",
    "there are only few features on nuclear systems , strongly dependent on single - particle degrees of freedom , which have been addressed in the cdft studies on the mean field level and compared with experiment .",
    "these are the single - particle properties in spherical and deformed nuclei , spin - orbit splittings in spherical nuclei , magnetic moments in the @xmath1 neighbours of the @xmath2o nucleus ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , and alignment properties of single - particle orbitals in rotating nuclei @xcite .",
    "the calculated single - particle spectra of spherical nuclei are frequently compared with experiment ( see , for example , refs .",
    "however , only in refs .",
    "@xcite deformation polarization effects and time - odd mean fields are included in the calculations which makes them more realistic .",
    "the spin - orbit splittings , as extracted from the single - particle energies obtained in spherical cdft calculations , reproduce the experimental spin - orbit splittings fairly well , although there are deviations up to 20% of absolute value of the splitting ( see figs .",
    "11 - 12 and table 4 in ref .",

    "note that the comparison of ref .",
    "@xcite includes the uncertainty of the spin - orbit splittings due to deformation polarization effects and time - odd mean fields as they are found in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xcite clearly shows that spin - orbit splittings are better described in cdft as compared with skyrme energy density functional theory ( sedft ) despite the fact that no single - particle information ( contrary to sedft ) has been used in the fit of the rmf lagrangian .    these comparisons",
    ", however , do not reveal the accuracy of the description of the single - particle states because the particle - vibration coupling ( pvc ) , which can affect considerably the energies of single - particle states in odd - mass nuclei @xcite , has been neglected .",
    "the modification of the quasiparticle states by particle - vibration coupling is weaker in deformed nuclei @xcite since the surface vibrations are more fragmented ( less collective ) than in spherical nuclei @xcite . as a consequence , the corrections to the energies of quasiparticle states in odd nuclei due to particle - vibration coupling",
    "are expected to be less state - dependent in deformed nuclei .",
    "hence the comparison between experimental and calculated energies of single - particle states is expected to be less ambiguous in deformed nuclei as compared with spherical ones @xcite , at least at low excitation energies , where vibrational admixtures in the wave functions are small .",
    "the analysis of the energies of one - quasiparticle deformed states in actinide region , performed within the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) approach in refs.@xcite , reveals that while the majority of the states are described with an accuracy better than 0.5 mev , there are a number of states which deviate from experiment by as much as 1 mev .",
    "the question arises of which features of the dft are most decisive for the single - particle structure .",
    "the most crucial ingredients in this respect are    * _ the effective nucleon mass and its radial dependence which determines the level density near the fermi surface_. it is well known that the one-(quasi- ) particle spectra calculated on the mean field level are less dense than in experiment both at spherical @xcite and deformed @xcite shapes .",
    "the average level density of the single - particle states on the mean field level is related to the effective mass ( lorentz mass in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of cdft theory ) of the nucleons at the fermi surface @xmath4 .",
    "the cdft is characterized by a low effective mass @xmath5 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "this low effective mass of cdft has a bigger impact on the single - particle spectra than the effective masses of non - relativistic dft which are typically larger .",
    "note that at spherical shape the inclusion of particle - vibrational coupling brings the calculated level density closer to experimental one characterized by an effective mass @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "* _ the spin - orbit potential which determines the energetic distance of the spin - orbit partners_. it is well known that cdft describes rather well spin - orbit splittings @xcite .",
    "however , these results have been obtained on the mean field level , and it is necessary to test how they will be affected by the inclusion of particle - vibrational coupling . in cdft theory",
    "the dirac effective mass @xmath7 is closely related to the effective spin - orbit single - nucleon potential , and empirical energy spacings between spin - orbit partner states in finite nuclei determine a relatively narrow interval of allowed values : @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this requirement restricts considerably the possible parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian on the mean field level , and thus it would be interesting to see whether the inclusion of pvc will loosen this requirement and thus allow wider range of effective masses in the cdft .",

    "_ the investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite , covering spherical odd nuclei bordering doubly magic nuclei clearly showed that the relative placement of the states with different orbital angular momenta @xmath10 is not so well reproduced on the mean field level in cdft .",
    "the problems occur predominantly in connection with the states of high @xmath10 which hints that the surface profile of the mean - field and kinetic terms are involved .",
    "microscopic consideration in many - body theory indicates that the effective mass has a pronounced surface profile which is insufficiently parametrized in the present mean - field models @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to see whether the inclusion of pvc will improve the description of the relative positions of the states with different orbital angular momentum @xmath9 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a relativistic particle - vibration coupling model has been developed and the calculations based on the nl3 @xcite parametrization of the cdft have been performed for the doubly magic @xmath11pb nucleus . in this work we present a more systematic investigation within this model including the calculations covering the nuclei from light @xmath0ni and medium - mass @xmath12sn , @xmath13sn to heavy @xmath11pb and superheavy @xmath14120 doubly magic nuclei using improved ( as compared with nl3 ) nl3 * @xcite parametrization of the cdft .",

    "the method of comparison of experimental and theoretical single - particle levels is discussed in sec .",

    "the comparison of model calculations with experiment is presented in sec .",
    "[ res - disc ] .",
    "the accuracy of the description of single - particle spectra and spectroscopic factors , the impact of particle - vibration coupling on shell gaps , spin - orbit splittings and pseudo - spin doublets as well as the role of polarization effects in odd - mass nuclei due to deformation and time - odd mean fields are discussed in detail .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec - final ] reports the main conclusions of our work .",
    "the experimental information about single - particle level structure of even - even doubly magic nucleus with the proton number @xmath15 and neutron number @xmath16 originates from the odd - mass @xmath17 and @xmath18 nuclear neighbors . in odd - mass nuclei , the polarization effects due to deformation and time - odd ( to ) mean fields induced by odd particle play an important role ( see sec .  [ pol - eff ] ) . in addition , the particle - vibration coupling modifies the energies and the structure of the levels ( secs .   [ sp - acc ] and [ spec - fac ] ) ; neither of them remains purely single - particle in nature . in order to describe all these effects we use a hybrid model ( labelled as `` hybrid '' below ) , in which the polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields are treated on the mean field level within cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) approach ( see sect .  [ mean - field ] ) , while the corrections due to the pvc are treated within relativistic particle - vibration coupling model ( see sect .",
    "[ beyond - mean - field ] ) .",
    "the need for a such hybrid model is dictated by the fact that the pvc model is not variational in nature and thus it does not allow to calculate polarization effects due to odd particle . since the polarization effects and the corrections due to the pvc have a different origin , they are treated as additive quantities in the hybrid model which is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the details of the hybrid model are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - theory ] .",
    "the experimental and calculated energies of the particle [ @xmath19 and hole [ @xmath20 states closest to the fermi level are determined from the difference of the binding energies of the core [ @xmath21 and the corresponding adjacent odd nuclei [ @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xcite @xmath24 and @xmath25 these quantities correspond to one - particle removal energies . we will call them as single - particle energies for simplicity of discussion .",
    "doubly magic spherical nuclei @xmath0ni , @xmath26sn , and @xmath11pb are used as the cores in our analysis .",
    "their ground states are not affected by pvc .",
    "the experimental energies of particles and holes defined according to these equations include the polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields induced by odd particle or hole as well as the energy corrections due to particle - vibration coupling in odd - mass nuclei .",
    "thus , their comparison with the results of `` hybrid '' calculations is straightforward .    on the other hand , there are some unresolved questions when these energies are compared with pure mean field calculations as it is done frequently in the literature .",
    "the problem is related to the fact that experimental single - particle levels and their energies and structure are affected by the particle - vibration coupling which is neglected on the mean field level .",
    "each mean field state @xmath27 with the energy @xmath28 is split into many levels due to particle - vibration coupling , so the single - particle strength is fragmented over many levels . in the diagonal approximation for the nucleonic self - energy , these levels have the same quantum numbers as the original mean field state @xmath27 , but different energies @xmath29 and spectroscopic factors @xmath30 . unlike the hartree or hartree - fock approximations without pairing where the single - particle states are",
    "either fully occupied or empty , in the pvc model their occupation probabilities are the real numbers between zero and one , so that sum rule @xmath31 is satisfied . for the states in the vicinity of the fermi surface one usually obtains one dominant level with @xmath32 and many other levels with small @xmath30 . for the states far from the fermi surface one observes very strong splitting over many levels with much smaller and comparable spectroscopic factors , see the detailed analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath11pb .",
    "this discussion clearly indicates that some procedure has to be employed in order to extract pure ( or `` bare '' ) single - particle energies from experimental data which have to be compared with mean field single - particle energies @xmath28 .",
    "two such procedures have been discussed in the literature .    in the first procedure , the energy of the dominant fragment is corrected by the energy shift due to particle - vibration coupling leading to a `` bare '' single - particle energy .",
    "such energies of the doubly - magic nuclei are extracted in some publications , see , for example , ref .",
    "however , this procedure relies on the choice of particle - vibration coupling model . however , different pvc models lead to different energy shifts ( see table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", such procedure frequently neglects polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields which are again model dependent .",
    "for example , there is no time - odd mean fields in the phenomenological models based on the nilsson or woods - saxon potentials .    in the second procedure ,",
    "the center of gravity of the fragmented levels with a given quantum number @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the total angular momentum and @xmath35 is a parity ) and energies @xmath29 is obtained via weighted - average @xcite procedure @xmath36   /   \\left [ \\sum_\\nu s_k^{\\nu } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this energy is then associated with a `` bare '' single - particle energy .",
    "this expression is fulfilled exactly in the pvc model discussed in sec .",
    "[ beyond - mean - field ] and it is satisfied with high accuracy in this model numerical implementation .",
    "the normalization in this procedure ( which is omitted in some publications ) is used to minimize the uncertainties due to large experimental errors on spectroscopic factors , since these errors lead to the fact that the sum rule @xmath37 is poorly fulfilled in the majority of experiments .",
    "the application of this procedure requires that all @xmath38-levels , to which the single - particle state @xmath27 is fragmented , are identified in the experiment and that spectroscopic factors are measured accurately .",
    "these conditions are definetely not satisfied in the @xmath0ni and @xmath26sn nuclei .",
    "the situation is somewhat better in @xmath11pb , for which the @xmath39 values have been extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite for a number of levels .",
    "however , even in this case the accuracy of the definition of @xmath39 is not known because of the number of the reasons listed below .",
    "the absolute values of spectroscopic factors are characterized by large ambiguities and depend strongly on the reaction employed in experiment and the reaction model used in the analysis @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic factors in odd mass nuclei have been obtained in different reactions : for example , in the ( d,@xmath40he ) reaction for @xmath41tl @xcite , ( @xmath42 , t ) for @xmath43bi @xcite , ( @xmath40he , @xmath42 ) @xcite and @xmath44 @xcite for @xmath41pb . even in the same nucleus",
    "different reactions give different spectroscopic factors ( see , for example , table i in ref .",
    "@xcite and table [ table - spec-1 ] in the current manuscript ) .",
    "in addition , the spins and parities of many high - lying fragments are uncertain ( see , for example , table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and/or only the part of the sum rule strength has been observed in experiment ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not clear whether the complete set of the @xmath38-levels , to which the single - particle state @xmath27 is fragmented , and their spectroscopic factors have been identified in experiment .    in the light of this discussion",
    "it is clear that `` bare '' single - particle energies can not be defined with controllable precision in the nuclei under study . as a result ,",
    "we compare observed experimental levels directly with mean field calculations .",
    "such an approach is frequently used in the literature ( see , for example , refs .",
    "it has clear limitations , but at least it allows to see ( i ) whether the inclusion of particle - vibration coupling improves the description of specific physical observables and ( ii ) whether the conclusions reached earlier on the mean field level are valid or not .",
    "mean field results related to polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields in odd - mass nuclei have been obtained using cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) theory @xcite .",
    "although this theory has initially been developed for the description of rotating nuclei , it is also able to describe the nuclear systems with broken time - reversal symmetry in intrinsic frame at no rotation in which to mean fields play an important role ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the application of the crmf theory has the following advantages .",
    "first , the crmf computer code is formulated in the signature basis . as a result",
    ", the breaking of kramer s degeneracy of the single - particle states in odd - mass nuclei is taken into account in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "this is important for an accurate description of to mean fields ( ref .",
    "these fields have considerable impact on the moments of inertia in rotating nuclei @xcite and the fact that the properties of such nuclei are well described in the crmf code ( see refs .",
    "@xcite adds confidence to proper description of to mean fields in non - rotating systems @xcite .",
    "second , the crmf computer code is formulated in three - dimensional cartesian coordinates which allows to describe not only axially deformed but also triaxial nuclear shapes .",
    "this is important for a proper description of polarization effects due to deformation .",
    "it is well known fact that the description of pairing correlations in doubly magic nuclei and their close neighborhood is notoriously difficult and model dependent ( ref .",
    "the presence of large shell gaps leads to a pairing collapse in the models with the treatment of pairing on the bcs or hfb [ hartree - fock - bogoliubov ] levels .",
    "this is seen , for example , in non - relativistic hfb calculations with the gogny d1s force of @xmath26sn in ref .",
    "the calculations within the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) framework of ref .",
    "@xcite with the same force for pairing also show pairing collapse in the ground states of @xmath0ni , @xmath26sn and @xmath11pb .",
    "the pairing correlations are restored when the particle number projection is implemented .",
    "however , there is a substantial difference between different approaches ( such as lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method of approximate particle number projection or projection after variation ( pav ) approach ) and variation after projection ( vap ) approach ; the latter represents the best approach for the treatment of pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "the rhb+ln calculations with the gogny d1s force for pairing show very weak pairing in the nuclei of interest .",
    "the additional binding due to pairing ( relatively to the results with no pairing ) is only 0.333 mev , 0.284 mev , 0.493 mev and 0.557 mev in @xmath0ni , @xmath26sn and @xmath11pb , respectively .",
    "the blocking of single - particle orbital in odd - mass nucleus leads to the weakening of pairing correlations and to frequent unphysical pairing collapse even in the rhb+ln calculations .",
    "the physical quantities , such as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq - part ] ) and ( [ eq - hole ] ) , are relative in nature .",
    "thus , we believe that in the case of weak pairing they are sufficiently well described in unpaired calculations . as a consequence ,",
    "we neglect pairing correlations in the crmf calculations .",
    "note that they are also neglected in the pvc calculations .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , binding energies of odd-@xmath45 nuclei were calculated by blocking the @xmath46 state ( amongst the @xmath47 states ) with the largest projection @xmath48 onto the symmetry axis . here ,",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath34 are the single - nucleon radial and total angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "the spherical subshell label of this state is used to label the configuration of odd mass nucleus since the deformations ( induced by odd particle or hole ) of immediate odd-@xmath45 neighbors of doubly magic nuclei are rather small .",
    "the mean field approach , being a very useful and convenient theoretical tool to describe finite nuclei , is , however , only a static and local approximation to the many - body problem . the non - locality ( or , equivalently , momentum dependence ) is implicitly taken into account by an effective mass which is considerably smaller than the bare nucleon mass .",
    "this enables one to reproduce reasonably well the general properties of the single - particle motion in the nuclear potential well .",
    "however , the mean field approximations based on the widely used skyrme , gogny as well as covariant density functionals generate too stretched single - particle spectra around the fermi surface and often fail to describe the sequence of the single - particle levels .",
    "proper inclusion of the time dependence in the nucleonic potential requires to go beyond the mean field description which is static by construction .    the underlying physics which is responsible for the time dependence is related to many - body correlations , i.e. to the part of the hamiltonian which can not be expressed in terms of the one - body density . in the medium mass and heavy nuclei the leading order contribution of such correlations to",
    "the nucleonic self - energy comes from coupling of the nucleonic motion to the surface and volume vibrational modes ( phonons ) .",
    "the most important collective vibrational modes are generated by the nuclear oscillations of the coherent nature .",
    "taking into account the coupling of these modes to the single - particle motion , the shell model acquires a dynamic content .",
    "these surface and volume oscillations , especially their low - lying modes , modify considerably the picture of the single - particle motion in nuclei .",
    "the main assumption of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling model is that two types of elementary degrees of freedom ",
    "one - quasiparticle ( 1-qp ) and collective ones  are coupled in such a way that configurations of 1-qp@xmath50phonon type with low - lying phonons strongly compete with simple 1-qp configurations located close in energy or , in other words , that quasiparticles can emit and absorb phonons with rather high probabilities @xcite .",
    "taking the quasiparticle - phonon coupling into account as an additional time dependent part of the nucleonic self - energy leads to the splitting of each mean - field single - particle state into many energy levels .",
    "the dominant levels , i.e. the levels with the largest spectroscopic factors , shift , as a rule , towards the fermi level improving considerably the agreement with data , see the review of various applications in ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this result is obtained , however , only for the states in about 10 mev vicinity of the fermi energy . for the states lying far from the fermi surface one",
    "observes a very strong fragmentation making an extraction of the dominant levels impossible .",
    "similar general picture has been obtained within the particle - vibration coupling extension of the covariant density functional theory @xcite . unlike the non - relativistic versions of the model , in the extended cdft the particle - phonon coupling self - energy allows intermediate nucleonic propagation through the dirac sea states with negative energies , in addition to the particle and hole states in the fermi sea . the contribution of the dirac - sea terms to the self - energy at the fermi level are , however , found negligibly small due to their large energy denominators .      in the present investigation",
    "we retain basically calculational scheme of ref .",
    "this approach implies linearized version of particle - vibration coupling model : the dyson equation for single - particle green function contains phonon - coupling self - energy with mean - field intermediate nucleonic propagators and phonon energies and vertices computed within relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) @xcite . for medium - mass and heavy nuclei",
    "the rrpa gives a very reasonable description of the phonon spectra .",
    "although a more precise description of the phonons can be achieved within an approach like relativistic time blocking approximation ( rtba ) @xcite , particle - vibration coupling model of ref .",
    "@xcite by using the rrpa phonons takes into account the major contribution of the vibrational motion to the single - particle spectra .    the application of the model to the lightest doubly magic nuclei @xmath2o , @xmath51ca , and @xmath52ca requires , however , a special consideration because their mean - field single - particle level densities are too small to provide a sizable configuration mixing around the fermi surface . for @xmath2o and @xmath51ca ,",
    "it is not possible , in principle , to reproduce within the rrpa the low - lying phonons with positive parity ( first positive parity particle - hole excitations are at too high energies ) . in such cases",
    "the phonon spectra for the nucleonic self - energy should be calculated allowing an extension for coupling to more complex configurations ; that implies a generalized particle - vibration coupling model .",
    "this will be done in a separate work .",
    "in @xmath52ca we have obtained a rather reasonable phonon spectrum , but the strong fragmentation of the hole states does not allow extraction of dominant single - particle levels .",
    "the phonons of unnatural parities are known to play only a marginal role in the nucleonic self - energy , therefore , they are not included into the phonon space .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of pairing vibrations into the phonon space has not been studied yet within the relativistic framework . in principle",
    ", they may bring some additional corrections to the results , although our approximation is justified by the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , where the fragmentation of the collective modes has been reproduced very well without inclusion of the pairing vibrations .",
    "the crmf equations are solved in the basis of an anisotropic three - dimensional harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinates characterized by the deformation parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 as well as the oscillator frequency @xmath55 mev .",
    "the truncation of the basis is performed in such a way that all states belonging to the shells up to fermionic @xmath56=20 and bosonic @xmath57=20 are taken into account in the calculations .",
    "numerical analysis indicates that this truncation scheme provides sufficient numerical accuracy for the physical quantities of interest .",
    "note that the same truncation of basis is used in the rrpa and pvc calculations , but they are performed at spherical shape .",
    "the nl3 * @xcite parametrization of the rmf lagrangian is used in the crmf , rrpa and pvc calculations .",
    "this recently fitted parametrization has been successfully applied to the description of binding energies @xcite , ground state properties of deformed nuclei @xcite , fission barriers @xcite , rotating nuclei @xcite , giant resonances @xcite , and breathing mode @xcite .",
    "phonons of the multipolarities 2@xmath58 , 3@xmath59 , 4@xmath58 , 5@xmath59 , 6@xmath58 with energies below 15 mev are included in the model space of the pvc calculations .",

    "a rather good convergence of the phonon coupling self - energy with extension of the phonon space has been obtained numerically : with very few exceptions , addition of phonon modes with energies above 15 mev does not affect the results .",

    "panel ( c ) shows how the angular momentum cut - off weakens the fragmentation effect .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn for other states either far from or around the fermi surface : cut - off on the angular momenta and on the energies of phonons has to be made with care .",

    "first , combined polarization effects due to deformation and time - odd mean fields decrease with an increase of mass number .",
    "indeed , with an increase of the size of nucleus the relative role of each single - particle orbital becomes smaller which leads to the fact that the calculated quadrupole deformations of odd - mass nuclei decrease with an increase of mass .",
    "for example ,",
    "the average proton and neutron deformations of calculated single - particle states in @xmath70cu and @xmath70ni are 0.045 and 0.060 , respectively . on the contrary , these deformations are significantly smaller in @xmath43bi and @xmath43sn ; they are only 0.0055 and 0.006 , respectively .",
    "thus , odd nuclei neighboring to @xmath11pb remain basically spherical .",
    "the decrease of calculated deformations of odd mass nuclei neighboring to doubly magic nuclei with increasing mass clearly indicates that deformation polarization effects also decrease with mass number .",
    "in addition , additional binding due to to mean fields decreases with mass ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the combination of these two effects is responsible for the features seen in fig .",
    "[ polarization ] .",
    "[ polarization ] also reveals that combined polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields are smaller for protons than for neutrons by a factor of approximately two .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath71 @xmath0ni and @xmath12sn nuclei which have the same proton and neutron single - particle states .",
    "the part of this difference comes from the fact that additional binding due to to mean fields is smaller for odd - proton nuclei as compared with odd - neutron ones ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite clearly indicates that the contributions of the coulomb force to the proton single - particle energies in the presence of to mean fields is responsible for this feature .",
    "deformation polarization effects show the same features , namely , they are smaller for odd - proton nuclei as compared with odd - neutron ones . for example , average deformation polarizations per single - particle state are 0.157 mev and 0.326 mev for proton and neutron single - particle states of @xmath0ni and 0.060 mev and 0.164 mev for proton and neutron single - particle states of @xmath12sn . similar to the case of polarizations due to to mean fields , the origin of this difference has to be traced back to the coulomb force since compared sets of proton and neutron single - particle states are the same in a given @xmath71 nucleus .    the majority of the comparisons of the energies of the single - particle states obtained in different particle vibration coupling models with experiment neglect deformation and to mean field polarization effects induced by the odd particle ( see , for example , refs .",

    "negative ( positive ) values of @xmath133 indicate that experimental spin - orbit splitting is underestimated ( overestimated ) in the calculations .",
    "one can see that in average the mean - field results are more or less evenly scattered around zero percentual deviation . on the contrary , with few exceptions particle - vibration coupling calculations underestimate experimental spin - orbit splittings .",
    "spin - orbit doublets built on the orbitals with high orbital momentum @xmath9 , involving the members across the shell gap , are rather well ( within the 20% deviation ) described in both calculations .",
    "these doublets are characterized by large spin - orbit splittings @xmath135 in the range of 5 - 7 mev , so the 20% deviation means that the absolute deviation from experiment is typically less than 1 mev .",
    "the largest percentual deviations are observed for the spin - orbit doublets built on the orbitals with low orbital angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "these doublets are characterized by low spin - orbit splittings so relatively low absolute deviations from experimental values of the order of few hundreds kev result in appreciable percentual deviations .",
    "the analysis of the results of calculations allows to conclude that the inclusion of particle - vibration coupling decreases the accuracy of the description of spin - orbit splittings .",
    "this is clearly visible when absolute and/or percentual deviations per doublet are compared in the mean field and pvc calculations .",
    "the absolute deviations per doublet are 0.34 mev [ 0.50 mev ] , 0.23 mev [ 0.56 mev ] and 0.26 mev [ 0.45 mev ] in the mean field ( `` def+to '' ) [ particle - vibration coupling ( `` hybrid '' ) ] calculations in @xmath0ni , @xmath13sn and @xmath11pb , respectively .",

    "second , relativistic description @xcite predicts a definite connection between the dirac effective mass @xmath136 of the nucleon in the kinetic energy and the strength of the spin - orbit force because the same effective mass appears in both terms .",
    "in addition , the spin - orbit term is sensitive to the spatial variations of the effective mass .",
    "particle - vibration coupling affects the effective mass of the nucleon and as a result it has an impact on calculated spin - orbit splittings .",
    "third , these results point to a new direction of improving the covariant energy density functionals .",
    "this is because empirical energy spacings between spin - orbit partner states in finite nuclei determine a relatively narrow interval of allowed values for the dirac effective mass @xmath137 on the mean field level @xcite .",
    "the observed impact of particle - vibration coupling on spin - orbit splittings suggests that this interval of the dirac effective mass @xmath136 may in reality be broader .",

    "the pseudospin doublet can be characterized by pseudospin doublet splitting energy which is defined as the difference of the energies of pseudospin doublet members @xmath142 with this definition of @xmath143 , the low-@xmath9 ( high-@xmath9 ) member of the pseudospin doublet is higher in energy than its high-@xmath9 ( low-@xmath9 ) counterpart if @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",

    "this is because both members of pseudospin doublet are located either above or below the shell gaps .",
    "the polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields act in the same direction for these states . as a result",
    ", these effects cancel each other to a large degree when the difference of the energies of the members of pseudospin doublet is taken .",
    "[ pseudo ] clearly shows that particle - vibration coupling substantially improves the description of splitting energies in pseudospin doublets ; the average deviations from experiment for @xmath143 are 0.93 mev and 0.6 mev in the mean field and pvc calculations , respectively .",

    "we did not find clear explanation for such large differences .",
    "proton and neutron pseudospin doublets with the same single - particle structure have similar splitting energies in experiment ( see pseudospin doublets indicated by the brackets with arrows in fig .  [ pseudo ] ) .",
    "this feature is rather well reproduced both in the mean field and pvc calculations for the proton and neutron @xmath148 pseudospin doublets of @xmath0ni . on the contrary , the mean field ( `` def+to '' )",
    "calculations completely fail to reproduce this feature for the proton and neutron @xmath149 pseudospin doublets in @xmath13sn and @xmath150 pseudospin doublets in @xmath11pb ( fig .  [ pseudo ] ) ; the calculated splitting energies for neutron doublets are by more than 1 mev larger than the ones for proton doublets . however , in the pvc calculations the splitting energies for these pairs of proton and neutron pseudospin doublets are similar in agreement with experiment .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that particle - vibration coupling decreases ( as compared with mean field calculations ) the splitting energies in neutron pseudospin doublets by more than 1 mev leaving at the same time the splitting energies in proton pseudospin doublets unchanged .",
    "the superheavy @xmath14120 nucleus has been predicted to have proton @xmath152 and neutron @xmath153 spherical shell closures within the rmf theory @xcite .",

    "@xcite supports the presence of the @xmath152 shell gap in superheavy nuclei .",
    "in addition , it indicates @xmath153 as a likely candidate for magic neutron number in superheavy nuclei .",
    "this nucleus represents a challenge for future experimental synthesis since it is located at the limits of accessibility by available cold fusion reactions .",
    "therefore , as accurate as possible estimations of its characteristics are needed from the theoretical side .",

    "[ fig-120 - 172 ] .",
    "they are compared with the results obtained on the mean field level .",
    "note that we restrict ourselves in the case of the @xmath14120 nucleus to spherical calculations .",
    "this is because the polarization effects due to deformation and to mean fields decrease with mass ( see sect .  [ pol - eff ] ) , and thus their impact on the single - particle spectra is expected to be rather small in the @xmath14120 nucleus .",
    "the density of the single - particle states is substantially larger than in lighter nuclei at the mean field level . as a consequence ,",
    "this nucleus exhibits a very rich spectrum of low - lying collective phonons already within the rrpa .",
    "for example , the lowest vibrational @xmath155 mode appears at 1.41 mev with b(e2)@xmath156 = 7.1 @xmath157 e@xmath158 @xmath159 , accompanied by several rather collective modes at 3.18 mev , 5.25 mev , 6.74 mev etc .",
    "similar picture is obtained for other multipolarities .",
    "although contributions to the nucleonic self - energy from the high - lying modes decrease quickly with energy , we have included phonons with all j@xmath60 values mentioned in sec .",

    "[ fig-120 - 172 ] shows that the particle - vibration coupling gives rise to the general compression of the spectra . as a consequence ,",
    "the size of the @xmath152 shell gap decreases from 3.35 mev ( in mean field calculations ) down to 2.67 mev ( in the pvc calculations ) , and the size of the neutron shell gap at @xmath153 from 2.42 mev down to 1.83 mev .",
    "although these gaps are smaller by 20 - 25% than the ones obtained in the mean field calculations , they are still significant . as a result , the @xmath14120 nucleus still remains doubly magic nucleus representing the center of the `` island of stability '' of superheavy nuclei even when the correlations beyond mean field are taken into account .",
    "the relativistic particle - vibration model has systematically been applied in combination with cranked relativistic mean field approach for the study of the impact of surface vibrations on single - particle motion .",
    "the polarization effects in odd mass nuclei due to deformation and time - odd mean fields have been treated in the crmf framework .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * particle - vibration coupling has to be taken into account when model calculations are compared with experiment since this coupling is responsible for observed fragmentation of experimental levels .",
    "the inclusion of particle - vibration coupling substantially improves the description of the energies of dominant single - particle states in @xmath13sn and @xmath11pb .",
    "however , the accuracy of the description of single - particle spectra in @xmath0ni is similar in the mean field and pvc calculations .",
    "note that dominant neutron single - particle states are in average better described than proton ones in the pvc calculations . * the polarization effects in odd - mass nuclei due to deformation and time - odd mean fields induced by odd particle are important . they have to be taken into account when",
    "experimental and calculated single - particle energies are compared .",
    "however , they are usually neglected when the results of particle - vibration coupling model calculations are compared with experiment .",
    "the current analysis indicates that within the framework of cdft this neglect is more or less justified only for heavy nuclei , and it is more justified for proton subsystem than for neutron one . *",
    "particle - vibration coupling leads to a shrinkage of the shell gaps .",
    "the size of the shell gaps is typically underestimated in the pvc calculations as compared with experiment and overestimated in the mean field calculations . *",
    "the inclusion of particle - vibration coupling decreases the accuracy of the description of spin - orbit splittings .",
    "the analysis suggests that the mean field constraint on the allowed range of the dirac effective mass @xmath137 is too restrictive and the range of the @xmath136 values can be broader in the models which take into account the correlations beyond the mean field . *",
    "particle - vibration coupling substantially improves the description of splitting energies in pseudospin doublets as compared with mean field calculations .",
    "observed similarity of the splitting energies of proton and neutron pseudospin doublets with the same single - particle structure in medium and heavy mass nuclei can only be reproduced when the particle - vibration coupling is taken into account .",
    "* the spherical shell closures in superheavy nuclei are still found at proton @xmath152 and neutron @xmath153 numbers even when particle - vibration coupling is taken into account",
    ". however , the size of these gaps becomes smaller ( as compared with mean field values ) in the presence of particle - vibration coupling due to general compression of the spectra caused by the increase of the effective mass of the nucleon at the fermi level .",
