    "numerical relativity is aimed at solving einstein s equations with the aid of computers .",
    "it took decades to reformulate einstein s equations to the required stability and accuracy in simulations .",
    "breakthroughs in 2005 and 2006 @xcite brought this development to a more mature status , gave confidence to the community in modeling gravitational wave sources and extracting information of gravitation radiation from the simulations of binary compact objects .",
    "since then , observations in simulations which have been refined and extensively studied over the past few years include long term gravitational waves and the final state of the binary compact objects merger ( see review articles @xcite and reference therein ) , gravitational recoil of a black hole @xcite , relativistic jet formation from mergers of black holes @xcite , and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "these also provide new insights into mathematical general relativity .",
    "numerical relativity has now become an indispensable and efficient tool in the research of general relativity and astrophysics .    among the numerous reformulations of einstein s equations ,",
    "two particular formulations are most frequently adopted for the simulations of black holes .",
    "one of them is the generalized harmonic formulation , in either second - order formulation @xcite , or fully first - order formulation @xcite ( in either case the key ingredient for stability of this formulation is a constraint damping mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "the other is the baumgarte ",
    "nakamura ( bssn ) system @xcite , which has been implemented by many groups using finite difference codes , in first - order - in - time and second - order - in - space form .",
    "there have been many studies in modifying the bssn formulation to increase its numerical stability . for example ,",
    "alcubierre and brgmann @xcite combined the bssn formulation with constraints enforcing the traceless condition of the conformal extrinsic curvature in every time step , replacing the conformal connection function @xmath0 with that calculated from the christoffel symbols whenever @xmath0 is undifferentiated . with these modifications",
    ", they evolved single black holes in kerr - schild coordinates stably with octant grid symmetry , and all fields settled down to equilibrium without encountering any instability .",
    "the confinement to grid symmetry was relaxed later in @xcite , by adding the @xmath1-constraint to the field equation of @xmath0 in order to suppress instability , as well as by employing alternative techniques in the enforcement of other algebraic constraints .",
    "yoneda and shinkai analyzed analytically the constraint propagation of bssn formulation in @xcite , and proposed adjustments to obtain better stability by adding constraint terms .",
    "the follow - up work in @xcite numerically verified the advantage of their adjustments in stability over the original bssn formulation .",
    "higher - order derivatives of constraint was also added to the field equation in @xcite to enhance stability .",
    "a first - order bssn formulation has been developed in @xcite to seek more stable performance in simulations .    in this work ,",
    "we report numerical tests of new modifications to the bssn system .",
    "the work can be considered as an extended study based on an earlier article @xcite .",
    "the modifications include ( 1 ) adding the @xmath1-constraint to the field equation of the conformal three - metric ; ( 2 ) replacing the conformal connection function calculated from the conformal metric , i.e. , @xmath2 , with the independent @xmath0 , and enhancing the derivative of the unimodular determinant constraint in the connection with an irreducible decomposition ; ( 3 ) applying , with some deformation , the adjustment of the field equation of the conformal extrinsic curvature with the momentum constraint proposed in @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize the alternative method in @xcite in the enforcement of the unimodular constraint and the traceless conformal extrinsic curvature constraint in every timestep .",
    "we experiment with these modifications on simulations of single kerr - schild black hole , and obtain evolutions with long - term stability .",
    "these modifications , also applied to the evolutions of binary punctured black hole , demonstrate better stability and accuracy than the original bssn formulation against numerical errors , either from finite - differencing or from mesh refinement .",

    "we will discuss here only the new improvements .",
    "for a solution of the bssn equations to be equivalent with a solution of the adm equations , the new auxiliary variables have to satisfy new constraint equations .",

    "these conditions ( [ detg1])-([gofg ] ) are also viewed as constraints in the bssn formulation , in addition to the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the recent efforts on the formalism extending the solution space of einstein s equation @xcite , the @xmath55 s are related to new dynamical variables whose evolution is mainly driven by momentum constraint , and therefore can be regarded as the cumulated effect of momentum constraint violations .    in an unconstrained evolution calculation ,",
    "the constraints are monitored only as a code check .",
    "it has been proven to be advantageous , however , either to enforce at least some of the constraints during the evolution , or to add evolution constraint equations to the evolution equations .      in the conventional adjustments @xcite , the algebraic constraints ( [ detg1 ] ) and ( [ tra0 ] )",

    "the alternative adjustments for constraints ( [ detg1 ] ) and ( [ tra0 ] ) in @xcite are as follows : instead of treating all components of @xmath40 equally , only five of the six components of @xmath40 need to be evolved dynamically , and the remaining one can simply be computed using eq .",

    "( [ dta ] ) .",
    "however , it is not recommended to choose any of the three off - diagonal components since the corresponding denominators for the off - diagonal components , i.e. , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , could vanish anywhere .",
    "one of the features of the alternative adjustments on @xmath49 and @xmath51 is the economy compared with conventional methods .",
    "only five , instead of six , components for both @xmath49 and @xmath51 need to be evolved dynamically , and the remaining one is determined by the algebraic constraint .",
    "meanwhile , the alternative adjustments `` correct '' only one component instead of all the components .",
    "it can be expected that results with the alternative adjustments will be more convergent than those with conventional adjustments . on the other hand ,",
    "the obvious shortcoming for the alternative adjustments is the asymmetric treatment of the six components .",

    "it is helpful numerically to choose a different diagonal pair for @xmath49 and @xmath51 , instead of the same diagonal pair , in eqns  ( [ gzz ] ) and ( [ ayy ] ) to increase the asymmetry in the evolution equations and to suppress the possible growth of the unstable modes ignited by numerical error . in the work we choose the pair ( @xmath72 ) , instead of ( @xmath73 ) in @xcite , to fulfill this requirement .      for a third - rank tensor @xmath74 with symmetry in the last two indices ,",
