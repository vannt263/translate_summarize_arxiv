    "in this paper we present a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of a high - statistics sample of events corresponding to the production of the @xmath13 system produced in @xmath14 collisions in two modes : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this sample size exceeds , by at least an order of magnitude , the largest published sample size of @xmath17 events to date .",
    "previous @xmath17 analyses led to the discovery and/or determination of properties of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath18 and the @xmath7 resonances @xcite .    in 1998 , the e852 collaboration reported evidence for the @xmath19 , a @xmath8 exotic hybrid meson with a mass of 1.6  gev/@xmath10 decaying into @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "that analysis was based on 250,000 events of the reaction @xmath20 collected in 1994 .",
    "we report on the analysis of additional data collected in 1995 including 3.0 m events of the reaction @xmath21 and 2.6 m events of the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "the identification of exotic mesons requires a pwa to extract signals .",
    "the @xmath17 system provides a particularly attractive venue for such searches since earlier work suggests a rich spectrum of meson resonances .",
    "if an exotic meson is produced with relatively small amplitude , its interference with nearby well - established resonances is a sensitive search tool .    in almost all of the published amplitude analyses of the @xmath17 system ,",
    "the _ isobar _ model was employed ",
    "a @xmath17 system with a particular @xmath22 is produced and decays into a di - pion resonance with well - defined quantum numbers and a bachelor @xmath23 followed by the decay of the di - pion resonance .",
    "this assumption is successful in describing many features of the @xmath17 system and is motivated by the observation that the di - pion effective mass spectrum shows prominent resonance production , for example , the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 .",
    "the di - pion resonances considered in this analysis include the @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the @xmath27 .",
    "we also include parametrizations of @xmath28-wave @xmath29 scattering .    in this analysis",
    ", we observe the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the @xmath7 in appropriate partial wave intensities and in their relative phase differences .",
    "we also searched for , but find no evidence for , the @xmath8 exotic @xmath19 in either the @xmath15 or @xmath16 mode .",
    "in order to extract reliable information from a partial wave analysis it is important to establish a procedure for determining a sufficient set of partial waves .",
    "failure to include important partial waves in the series expansion may lead to inconsistent results and erroneous conclusions . in this paper",
    "we describe our procedure for determining a sufficient wave set .",
    "that procedure includes a comparison of moments as calculated from pwa solutions with those computed directly from data .",
    "we emphasize that this analysis is similar to that of references   @xcite in that the same isobar model assumptions are made but the final set of partial waves used is different .",
    "both analyses make the same assumptions about coherence between different partial waves .",
    "it is possible that relaxing these coherence assumptions could lead to different results in both analyses .",
    "the @xmath17 system with non - zero charge has isospin @xmath31 , and , since no flavor exotic mesons have been found , we assume @xmath32 .",
    "since a state with an odd number of pions has negative @xmath33  parity , the relationship @xmath34 implies positive @xmath35  parity for the @xmath12 system .",
    "the simultaneous observation of the two @xmath12 modes , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in the same experiment provides important cross checks .",
    "consider the production of resonance @xmath36 and its subsequent decay into @xmath12 via an intermediate di - pion resonance .",
    "if the intermediate di - pion resonance is an isoscalar , then the yield into @xmath16 should be twice that into @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , if the di - pion is an isovector , then there should be equal yields into @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes rely on different elements of the detector , any misunderstandings in the acceptance would affect the two modes differently and ultimately lead to inconsistent interpretations of the pwa results .",
    "this underscores the importance of having these two different modes to validate the analysis .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a spectrum of mesons beyond the @xmath37 bound states of the conventional quark model .",
    "the spin ( @xmath38 ) , parity ( @xmath39 ) and charge conjugation ( @xmath35 ) quantum numbers of a @xmath37 system are : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angular momentum between the quarks and @xmath42 is the total quark spin , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the @xmath22 combinations : @xmath45 are not allowed and are called",
    "_ exotic _ .",
    "lattice qcd @xcite and qcd - inspired models predict that the excitation of the gluonic field within a meson leads to _ hybrid _ mesons , where the gluonic degrees of freedom allow hybrid mesons to have exotic quantum numbers .",
    "the observation of hybrid mesons and measurement of their properties provides experimental input necessary for an understanding of quark and gluon confinement in qcd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] is a discussion of experimental details , including a description of the apparatus ( [ sec : apparatus ] ) , event reconstruction and selections ( [ sec : data ] ) and distributions in effective mass before and after acceptance corrections ( [ sec : masses ] ) .",
    "an overview of the pwa methodology , including selection of the wave set , is given in section  [ sec : pwamethod ] .",
    "section  [ sec : pwaresults ] is a presentation of the pwa results for individual partial waves using the wave set used in this analysis and the wave set used in the analysis of references @xcite for both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 modes .",
    "section  [ sec : exotica ] focuses on the exotic @xmath8 waves and how the failure to include important @xmath48 waves could lead to misleading conclusions regarding the existence of an exotic resonance .",
    "section  [ sec : systematics ] discusses studies of systematic uncertainties and the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the e852 experiment used the upgraded multiparticle spectrometer ( mps ) at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) at brookhaven national lab ( bnl ) .",
    "the apparatus is described in detail elsewhere @xcite and is shown schematically in figure  [ mps ] .",
    "the mps was upgraded for e852 with the inclusion of a cylindrical drift chamber ( tcyl ) @xcite and a cylindrical cesium iodide ( csi ) detector @xcite , both concentric with a lh@xmath49 target .",
    "downstream of the target were proportional wire chambers ( pwcs ) for triggering and tracking , a lead / scintillator array ( dea ) and a 3000-element lead glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( lgd ) .",
    "the csi calorimeter consisted of 180 segments  10 longitudinal segments and 18 azimuthal segments .",
    "the dea had the geometry of a picture frame with a rectangular central hole . a scintillation counter ( cpv )",
    "was placed just upstream of and matched the geometry of the dea .",
    "the lead glass blocks of the lgd @xcite were each 45  cm long with a transverse area of @xmath50  @xmath51 and were arranged in a @xmath52  @xmath51 stack with a 2  block @xmath53 2  block beam hole to allow for passage of non - interacting beam particles .",
    "the dea and csi detected low - energy photons that miss the lgd .",
    "the lgd was used to measure energies and positions of photons from @xmath54 and @xmath55 mesons .",
    "the mps included an analyzing magnet with a 1  t field and drift chambers for tracking .",
    "the lh@xmath49 target was 30  cm long and 6  cm in diameter .",
    "the beam was an 18.3  gev/@xmath3 negatively charged beam consisting mainly ( 95% ) of @xmath56 and had a momentum bite @xmath57 of 3% and a momentum resolution @xmath58 of 1% . the target to lgd distance was approximately 5  m. the interacting beam trigger required no signal from a small scintillation counter placed in the path of the beam in coincidence with beam defining counters upstream of the mps . event triggers included all - neutral , all charged and a mix of neutral plus charged particle topologies .",
    "the neutral particle requirement depended on energy and/or multi - photon effective mass information from the lgd .",
    "we refer to the @xmath59 system as the _ neutral _ mode and the @xmath60 system as the _ charged _ mode . in tables",
    "[ cutsn ] and [ cutsc ] the selection requirements and resulting event sample sizes are summarized for the neutral and charged modes respectively . in",
    "what follows we discuss details of these requirements @xcite .",
    ".[cutsn]summary of requirements applied to the data set leading to @xmath61 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     another arbiter of wave set sufficiency is the comparison of moments , @xmath62 , of the @xmath63 functions as calculated directly from the data and as calculated using the results of pwa fits .",
    "a pwa using a sufficient set of partial waves will reproduce all angular distributions of the data as evidenced by the agreement of the observed and calculated moments .",
    "we define @xmath64 where @xmath65 represents the euler angles of the @xmath17 system and the intensity @xmath66 is determined directly from experiment or computed using the results of the pwa fits .",
    "both of these techniques were used in this analysis .",
    "the @xmath29 isobars included in this analysis are the @xmath67 , @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 where @xmath68 is meant to indicate a @xmath28-wave @xmath29 system as described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a background wave is included .",
    "the background wave is characterized by a uniform distribution in the relevant decay angles and is added incoherently with the other waves .",
    "we restrict the parent wave set to those with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "waves were sequentially removed from the parent set and the resulting change in likelihood ( @xmath72 ) examined @xcite .",
    "three passes were used .",
    "first , waves with an l=0 isobar ( @xmath73 @xmath28-wave and @xmath74 ) were examined .",
    "subsequent passes examined @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) isobar partial waves .",
    "a pwa with the wave in question removed was performed and the resulting likelihood compared to pwa including the wave . if the change in @xmath79 was less than 40 the wave was removed .",
    "figure  [ sig_nosig ] shows the change in @xmath79 when a significant , but not a dominant , wave ( @xmath80wave ) is removed compared to when an insignificant wave ( @xmath81wave ) is removed .",
    "certain partial waves that would have been removed by this selection criterion were kept because the existence of signals in these waves is under consideration .",
    "the negative reflectivity exotic @xmath82 partial waves were kept even though they would have been chosen for removal by the above criterion .",
    "the positive reflectivity exotic partial wave failed the selection criterion everywhere above 1.4 @xmath83 and exhibited large fluctuations in intensity below this mass .",
    "this partial wave was also kept and its contribution to the likelihood is further examined below using the final set of partial waves .",
    "finally , the @xmath84-wave ( which failed the selection test ) was kept to serve as a possible reference wave for evaluation of phase differences of negative reflectivity partial waves . based on these criteria",
    "the compiled set includes 35 waves and a background wave .",
    "we refer to this as the _ high - wave set_.    the analysis reported in reference  @xcite used a wave set consisting of 20 waves including the background wave  we refer to this as the _ low - wave set_. table  [ thewaves ] lists the waves used in low - wave and high - wave sets .",
    "the waves included only in the low - wave set are labeled with [ l ] in table  [ thewaves ] while the waves included only in the high - wave set are labeled with [ h ] and those included in both sets are labeled with [ b ] .      the pwa solutions obtained with the two wave sets were used to compute moments that were then compared directly with data . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the @xmath85 and @xmath86 moment comparisons as a function of @xmath17 mass for the @xmath46 mode for low - wave and high - wave set pwa fits .",
    "we also show the difference between data and pwa calculations of the moments as @xmath87 ( summing differences squared divided by errors squared summed over all mass bins and divided by the number of mass bins ) for various moments .",
    "similar plots are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the @xmath88 mode .",
    "the moments calculated using the pwa results from the high wave set have better agreement with experimental moments , but there are moments ( such as @xmath85 - shown in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig3 ] ) for which agreement is not achieved .",
    "this may be due to the inherent inadequacy of the isobar model in describing the underlying production mechanism .",
    "an examination of figures  [ fig2](c ) and [ fig3](c ) show that for all the moments , the moments calculated using the high - wave set have better agreement with data than do moments calculated using the low - wave set .",
    "the pwa results presented in this section were for data with @xmath89  ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath90 referred to as @xmath91 in table  [ tbins ] .",
    "the analysis was also carried out in 11 other bins in @xmath92  some results of which will also be summarized below .    figure  [ nc_all_bkg ] shows the sum of all waves in the high - wave set along with the background wave for both the charged and neutral modes . the fitting procedure constrains the sum of all the waves to agree with the acceptance - corrected @xmath17 mass distribution .",
    "the background wave ( uniform in all angles ) is added incoherently with the other waves . as can be seen ,",
    "the contribution from the background wave is small ( of order 1% ) .",
    "there is a systematic disagreement in the relative normalization between the two modes resulting from an overall per track inefficiency of 5% in the trigger pwc s .",
    "the overall inefficiency has no bearing on the features of the acceptances and was thus not incorporated into the monte carlo corrections , but results in the neutral mode having a yield consistently 25% higher than the charged mode .",
    "the neutral mode required only one forward - going charged particle in the trigger while the charged mode required three .    in the following we discuss intensities and phases of individual partial waves .",
    "a partial wave intensity corresponds to a single term of equation  ( [ int ] ) which is a product of the fitted partial wave amplitude , @xmath93 , and the isobar amplitude @xmath94 .",
    "similar to the procedure followed in references  @xcite , the intensities are integrated over acceptance corrected data , and are normalized to the total number of events .",

    "for each the results from the high wave set and low wave set are shown .",
    "the @xmath95 wave is a dominant wave and the results of the pwa for the two wave sets ( high and low ) are in good agreement .",
    "the yield for the two charged modes is also consistent with expectations from isospin for the @xmath96 system .    the @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97-wave is not included in the high - wave set , since it did not meet criteria for inclusion , but it is included in the low - wave set . the observed ratio of @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath28-wave to @xmath97-wave in the low - wave set is consistent with that of reference  @xcite .",

    ", we expect an equal number of charged mode and neutral mode events .",
    "this wave is clean and robust and will be used for interferometry to study the phase motion of other waves relative to this wave .",
