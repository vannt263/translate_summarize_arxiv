    "understanding the interaction between a microscopic quantum system and its macroscopic environment is one of the most exciting challenges of the modern quantum mechanics .",
    "such an interaction is known to perturb the phase relations between the components of quantum superpositions which damages the system ability to show quantum interference .",
    "this effect , known as decoherence or dephasing , is essential for our understanding of the origins of classical behavior.@xcite moreover , it limits the feasibility of exploiting the quantum properties of micro- and mesoscopic systems for performing useful tasks , out of which quantum computation @xcite is perhaps the widest known .",
    "dephasing phenomena manifest themselves in any quantum system .",
    "it is , however , natural to seek for their realization in the most clear form .",
    "such an ultimate demonstration seems to be a realization of a `` thought '' experiment opening many quantum mechanics textbooks @xcite : vanishing of the single - particle interference fringes in a two - slit ( young ) experiment due either to some perturbation of the environment state or to a controlled measurement .",
    "such a trace ( often referred to as _ which path _ information ) left in the measurement device or in the environment allows one ( at least in principle ) to identify the path chosen by the particle and destructs the interference to the extent depending on the distinguishability of the paths .",
    "experiments of this kind were realized with electrons in a semiconductor system @xcite as well as in optical,@xcite neutron,@xcite and atomic @xcite interference setups .",
    "it was also suggested @xcite that an analogous demonstration in the time domain could be based on interference experiments @xcite in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "another realization has been proposed,@xcite involving free electron interference with a plate of finite conductivity placed below the electron paths and parallel to them .",
    "a model for the decoherence effect in such a setup has been formulated on phenomenological basis,@xcite using the picture of image charges screening the external flying electron .",
    "the image charge would move parallel to the real electron inducing energy dissipation ( joule heat generation ) due to finite conductivity of the material .",
    "the dissipation effect was quantitatively estimated using an earlier calculation of velocity fields penetrating a metal.@xcite the essential qualitative features of the resulting dephasing effect is the dependence on the distance to the plate ( which governs the overall intensity of the _ which path _ trace ) and on the distance between the paths ( on which the degree of distinguishability depends ) .    with the state - of - the - art experimental techniques , such a free - electron interference and controlled dephasing experiment is feasible .",
    "it is possible to observe interference fringes in experiments with single electrons.@xcite it has been proposed to use a single - electron interferometer @xcite to show the controlled dephasing effect due to the conducting plate.@xcite    the present paper aims at the development of a fully quantum description of the electron dephasing under the specific experimental conditions as described above . on the microscopic level , the _ which path",
    "_ information is transferred from the electron ( the system ) to the conducting plate ( the environment , or reservoir ) by exciting the electrons in the plate .",
    "this effect may be described by analyzing the electron coupling to the electromagnetic modes affected by the presence of a conducting surface , as previously done for a superconducting @xcite and conducting @xcite plate . in order to capture the essential ( dissipative ) effect of the excitations in the reservoir",
    "it is , however , profitable to formulate the description in terms of the direct coupling between these two systems which is achieved by using the coulomb gauge .",
    "a description developed in a different context @xcite shows that such a _ which path _ decoherence effect can be quantitatively represented as the overlap between the spectral density of the reservoir fluctuations and the appropriate spectral function related to the unperturbed evolution of the system .",
    "the present calculation follows the same path , with the reservoir fluctuations expressed in terms of the standard longitudinal dielectric function of the conductor .",
    "it turns out that the interaction between the flying electron and the charges in the plate involves low frequencies but high momentum transfer , which suggests that description going beyond the debye model is necessary .",
    "therefore , the present calculation includes a complete model of the quantum properties of the reservoir .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section [ sec : model ] the system under discussion and its model",
    "are presented .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] the general framework of the theory is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : r ] the problem is reduced to finding the low frequency longitudinal dielectric function .",
    "this is done for a metallic plate in the following sec .",

    "[ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "in the proposed experimental setup,@xcite non - relativistic electrons with energies in the range of 150 ev to 3 kev are emitted by an electron gun .",
    "this corresponds to velocities @xmath0 to @xmath1 m / s ( i.e. , roughly one order of magnitude higher than the fermi velocities for metals @xcite ) .",
    "the electron beam is split into two paths separated by @xmath2 @xmath3 m . both paths",
    "pass over a conducting plate of length @xmath4 cm at a height @xmath5 mm and then interfere on a screen . the part of the experimental system relevant for the dephasing effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] . it will be assumed that over the plate the electron paths are parallel .",
    "the plate is taken to have a length @xmath6 and a very large height @xmath7 and width @xmath8 .",
    "the coordinate system is oriented in such a way that the @xmath9 plane coincides with the plate surface and the electron paths are parallel to the @xmath10 axis . in order to refer the present calculations directly to the experiment",
    ", a single electron wave function will be chosen in the form of a gaussian quantum wave packet travelling over the plate at a speed @xmath11 in a superposition of the two paths .",
    "we will assume that the electron wave packets corresponding to the two alternative paths do not overlap and that their extension is much smaller than any distance in the experiment geometry .",
    "for the electron velocities as given above , the dispersion of a minimum - uncertainty electron wave packet with initial width of a few micrometers leads to an additional spread of @xmath12 m per 1  cm of flight path , so the effects of dispersion may be neglected .",
    "it will also be assumed that the time interval between the consecutive electrons is much larger than the relaxation times relevant to the conducting plate so that each flight event is independent of the previous ones .",
    "the experiment is done at room temperature .",
    "( 65,30)(0,5 ) ( 0,0 )    as mentioned above , contrary to the previous work,@xcite the present analysis uses the coulomb gauge . in this way",
    ", the longitudinal electromagnetic field is eliminated in favor of direct and instantaneous coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom in the metal .",
    "thus , the problem is of longitudinal screening type and may be treated using the well - established knowledge on the density - fluctuation spectra of the electron gas and its relation to the longitudinal dielectric function.@xcite this choice relates also the present calculation more closely to the original phenomenological concept @xcite ( although the decoherence mechanism is described in a different way ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coulomb interaction of the electron in the beam with the electrons and ions in the solid is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density operator for the electron beam , @xmath15 is the total charge density at a point @xmath16 in the conducting plate ( including both electrons and ions ) , @xmath17 is the elementary charge , @xmath18 is the vacuum dielectric constant ( the si system of units is used ) .",
    "the ordering of operators in eq .",
    "( [ ham - full ] ) results from the assumption that the electron above the plate is distinguishable from those in the solid .",
    "since a uniformly moving electron does not radiate transverse fields on macroscopic distances , we disregard the coupling to the electromagnetic vacuum via vector potential and calculate the contribution to decoherence only from the longitudinal excitations , thus neglecting the effect of the conducting surface via modification of the transverse electromagnetic field fluctuations.@xcite it should be noticed that we aim at a full microscopic description of the interaction , hence no image potentials are inserted `` by hand '' in the hamiltonian ( [ ham - full ] ) .",
    "the interaction between the electron and the charges in the plate ( classically described as the image potential ) will result from the microscopic theory , while the mutual screening of electrons in the plate must be included in the correct description of the longitudinal response of the interacting electron system .    since we consider a flight of exactly one electron over the plate , the corresponding density operator may be written in the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the position eigenstate of the electron . in the interaction picture , the coulomb part of the interaction hamiltonian reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the evolution operator for noninteracting subsystems .",
    "the electron may travel along one of two paths , with the corresponding quantum states @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the electron wave functions in the position representation . since the essential decoherence effect is related to path distinguishability which affects only the relative phase between these two quantum states , processes leading outside the two - dimensional subspace spanned by these states",
    "may be neglected .",
    "projecting the electron states onto this subspace one gets @xmath26 under the assumption that the wave functions corresponding to the two basis states do not overlap .",
    "hence , we have @xmath27",
    "in this section the general framework for the description of the perturbation to the electron state ( in the 2-dimensional subspace defined above ) is described .",
    "the approach is based on the second order expansion of the evolution equation for the density matrix in the presence of the instantaneous coulomb interaction with the charges in the conducting plate . as a result one",
    "gets an expression for the visibility of interference fringes in a single - electron interference experiment in terms of a set of correlation constants depending on the electron evolution and on the reservoir properties .",
    "qualitative discussion based on the general form of these correlation constants is also presented here , while the quantitative analysis is performed in the following sections .    according to the standard theory,@xcite the final reduced density matrix of the electron subsystem",
    "may be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the reduced density matrix in the interaction picture .",

    "since the average fluctuation of the electron gas density in the plate vanishes in equilibrium , the leading order contribution to the dephasing is the second term .",
    "it may be written in the form @xmath35-\\frac{1}{2}\\{a,\\varrho_{0}\\ }      + \\hat{\\phi}[\\varrho_{0}],\\ ] ] where the first contribution is a unitary correction and the two other ones describe dephasing ( @xmath36 denotes an anti - commutator ) . in the present case it may be shown that @xmath37 , so that this term does not contribute .",
    "physically , it contains the correction to the electron motion due to the interaction with the image charge induced in the metal . due to the symmetry between the paths , these corrections are identical for both states and do not induce any nontrivial evolution within the restricted subspace .",
    "their overall effect may be estimated by considering the attraction force @xmath38 acting during the time of @xmath39 , which results in a negligible vertical shift of at most 100 nanometers .",

    "obviously , @xmath45 ; in fact , both these constant are real and equal to each other due to the symmetry between the beams which excludes any relative phase shifts .",

    "also , since @xmath159 , we may put @xmath160 in the denominator . in this approximation ,",
    "the effect of screening by the lattice excitations is fully contained in the ion dielectric constant @xmath161 in this discussion the imaginary part of the lattice response describing the dissipative effects has been neglected .",
    "such effects must always be resonant , i.e. , they involve phonons with low frequencies @xmath162 .",
    "the density of states for such long - wavelength phonons is very low .",
    "moreover , at the corresponding low momenta @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the sound speed , the real part of the total dielectric function is very large due to electron contribution ( see below ) , so that such low - frequency lattice excitations are additionally very strongly screened .",
    "therefore , the lattice contribution to the dissipative processes [ i.e. , to the @xmath165 function ] is negligible . in terms of the general picture of the dephasing due to the trace in the environment",
    "this means that most of the phonons have frequencies much higher than that characteristic of the external field so that they follow the perturbation adiabatically , returning to the original state after the flying electron is away and thus registering no trace of its passage .    the total dielectric function including electron transitions within the conduction band and the lattice screening as described above is therefore described by the formula @xmath166 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we take into account that in the isotropic model the dielectric function may depend only on the value but not on the direction of @xmath106 .",
    "the electron susceptibility in the quasi - free electron model valid for arbitrary @xmath127 is given by the lindhard formula @xcite @xmath167 where @xmath168 , @xmath169 is the electron mass and @xmath170 is the fermi - dirac distribution . since the function @xmath171 has an exponential spectral cut - off at frequencies much lower than the fermi energy , one needs only the low - frequency part of the dielectric function ( as already remarked in sec .",

    "however , here @xmath199 refers to the electrons in the metal and involves the mass of these electrons .",
    "in fact , decoherence results from the perturbation of the reservoir state and not that of the system @xcite .",
    "since the reservoir responds to the electromagnetic field of the flying electron , its state may depend on its charge but not on the mass .",
    "therefore , it should be expected that particles of different mass but equal charge will undergo the same decoherence .    the time constant @xmath200 was originally interpreted as the energy dissipation rate , i.e. the rate at which energy is transferred from the electron to the reservoir .",
    "a similar interpretation is possible here , within a semi - classical approach .",
    "the electrons in the metal involved in interactions with external fields are those near the fermi surface . the relative rate at which their energy changes is therefore @xmath201 the variation of the energy of electrons is due to their acceleration by the electric field @xmath202 of the flying electron the distance to which is roughly @xmath75 , so that @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the electron speed at the fermi surface and the screening by ions has been included . using the equalities @xmath205 and",
    "@xmath206 one arrives at the formula ( [ tau - r ] ) .    in spite of the formal similarity of eq .",
    "( [ tau - d ] ) to the phenomenological decoherence rate obtained from the energy losses due to dc resistance and joule heating @xcite , the present theory actually describes a different mechanism of decoherence .",
    "the dc resistance - based description assumes implicitly that formation of the screening image charge is dissipationless ( adiabatic ) , involving only virtual transitions , and therefore reversible .",
    "the irreversible , dissipative processes take place only due to carrier scattering as the image charge moves beneath the metal surface . since , at high temperature , such scattering is mostly due to phonons , the which path information is effectively stored in lattice excitations . in contrast , the quantum description presented here shows that already the process of formation of the image charge is to a large extent dissipative , even in the absence of carrier - phonon scattering .",
    "since the reservoir response to the external charge involves only excitations of low frequency but of arbitrary momenta the appropriate dielectric function is different from the commonly used drude limit . as a result , there is no direct correlation between the decoherence effect and the dc conductivity or resistivity . instead , for metals the theory predicts roughly inverse proportionality to the fermi momentum which is the only material parameter entering the result ( apart from the electron mass ) .",
    "quantitative comparison shows that for noble metals the rate given by eq .",
    "( [ tau - r ] ) is many orders of magnitude higher than that resulting from resistive dissipation .",
    "therefore , the ohmic resistivity effect is of minor importance .",
    "the decoherence effect on a single electron travelling over a conducting plate was calculated in a model reflecting the conditions of a currently performed experiment .",
    "the dissipative response of the electron gas in the plate , tending to screen the external charge , generates a trace in the plate .",
    "the resulting distinguishability of the electron paths destroys the electron s ability to interfere . in order to describe this effect quantitatively a fully quantum model of the mutual interaction between the electron and the conductive reservoir",
    "was formulated .",
    "the decoherence effect may be expressed by the spectral density of the reservoir fluctuations which , in turn , is related to its dissipative properties , i.e. , to the imaginary part of the inverse longitudinal dielectric function . the resulting decoherence was described for a metallic reservoir but the qualitative form of the result depends only on the universal linear frequency dependence of its imaginary part .",
    "therefore , the decoherence effect will be qualitatively similar for any plate material ( e.g. , for semiconductors ) as long as the electron gas response is dominated by the low - frequency sector . whether this is the case for a specific system ,",
    "will depend on the interplay of the experimental conditions and material parameters .",
    "the results presented in the paper explain the mechanism of electron dephasing on a fully quantum level and give quantitative estimations of the effect , depending on the material parameters and the geometry of the experimental setup .",
    "therefore , they should be helpful for experimental studies in this fundamental field .",
