    "what are the _ observables _ of a relativistic quantum theory ?",
    "standard wisdom holds that any self - adjoint operator that can be defined on a spacelike slice through spacetime is measurable in principle .",
    "but in fact , measuring a typical such operator is forbidden by relativistic causality , and hence impossible .",
    "more generally , it is often stated that the possible ways that the state of a quantum system can change are described by _ quantum operations _",
    " completely positive trace non - increasing linear maps of density operators to density operators @xcite .",
    "but in a relativistic quantum theory , typical operations would allow superluminal signaling , and are therefore unphysical .",
    "relativistic quantum field theory allows us to identify an algebra of observables that is compatible with the causal structure of spacetime @xcite . despite this marvelous achievement , puzzles and open questions",
    "our objective in this paper is to understand better the restrictions on operations that are imposed by special relativity .",
    "mostly , we will consider a simplified version of the problem in which the physical system is divided into two separated parts : part @xmath0 , which is controlled by a party that we will call alice , and part @xmath1 , which is controlled by bob .",
    "initially , alice and bob share a joint quantum state whose density operator @xmath2 is not known , and they wish to transform the state to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a specified operation .    if alice and bob were able to communicate by sending quantum information back and forth , then they would be able to apply _ any _ operation @xmath5 to their state .",
    "we want to determine what operations they can implement if _ no _ communication ( quantum or classical ) is permitted . in a relativistic setting , these are the operations that can be realized if alice s action and bob s action are spacelike - separated events .",
    "we will , though , permit alice and bob to make use of a shared entangled _ ancilla _",
    "state that might have been prepared earlier and distributed to them .    while alice and bob are permitted to perform measurements",
    ", bob can not know the outcome of alice s measurement , and alice can not know the outcome of bob s .",
    "therefore , we will largely restrict our attention to _ trace - preserving _ quantum operations , also known as _",
    "superoperators _ , where no postselection of the quantum state based on the measurement outcome is allowed .",
    "we say that a bipartite superoperator is _ localizable _ if it can be implemented by alice and bob acting locally on the shared state and the shared ancilla , without any communication from alice to bob or bob to alice .",
    "another important concept is that of a _",
    "causal operation_. we say that an operation is causal if it does not allow either party to send a signal to the other .",
    "more precisely , imagine that bob applies a local superoperator @xmath6 to his half of the state he shares with alice just before the global operation @xmath4 acts on the joint system , and that alice makes a local measurement on her half just after @xmath4 acts .",
    "if alice s measurement can acquire any information about what operation was applied by bob , then we say that bob can signal alice .",
    "the operation is causal if no such signaling is possible in either direction .",
    "entanglement shared by alice and bob can not be used to send a superluminal signal from alice to bob or from bob to alice .",
    "therefore , any localizable superoperator is surely a causal superoperator .",
    "what about the converse ?",
    "it might seem reasonable to expect that _ any _ operation , if it respects the principle that information can not propagate outside the forward light cone , should be physically realizable in principle .",
    "however , we will show otherwise by exhibiting some examples of superoperators that are causal but not localizable .",
    "we obtain weaker notions of localizability and causality by considering communication in just one direction .",
    "we say that a superoperator is _ semilocalizable _ if it is possible to implement it with _ one - way _ quantum communication from alice to bob .",
    "such operations are physically realizable if bob s action takes place in the future light cone of alice s action .",
    "similarly , we say that an operation is _ semicausal _ if it does not allow bob to send a signal to alice . obviously , a semilocalizable superoperator is semicausal  communication from alice to bob can not help bob to send a message to alice .",
    "what about the converse ?",
    "if one believes that causality is a very special property of operations that is not likely to hold `` by accident , '' then it is natural to formulate the following conjecture , suggested to us by divincenzo @xcite :    * conjecture * _ every semicausal superoperator is semilocalizable .",
    "_    we will prove this conjecture for the special case of complete orthogonal measurement superoperators .",
    "whether it holds in general remains an open question .    the problem of characterizing what measurements are possible was raised by dirac @xcite , and interesting examples of impossible measurements were pointed out in @xcite .",
    "that relativistic causality may restrict the operators that can be measured in a field theory was first emphasized by landau and peierls @xcite ( though their particular concerns were well answered by bohr and rosenfeld @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , these restrictions have been noted by a variety of authors @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "we have addressed some particular causality issues that arise in non - abelian gauge theories .    to apply our notion of localizability to quantum field theory",
    ", we must adopt the convenient fiction that the entangled ancilla is an external probe not itself described by the field theory , and that its local coupling to the fields is completely adjustable .",
    "this idealization is highly questionable in a quantum theory of gravity , and even for quantum field theory on flat spacetime it is open to criticism .",
    "in particular , field variables in spatially adjacent regions are inevitably entangled @xcite , so that no strict separation between field and ancilla variables is really possible .",
    "on the other hand , if the probe variables are `` heavy '' with rapidly decaying correlations and the field variables are `` light , '' then our idealization is credible and worthy of study .",
    "should the conjecture that semicausality implies semilocalizability prove to be true , then we will have a general and powerful criterion for deciding if a superoperator can be executed with one - way communication .",
    "even so , we will lack a fully satisfactory way of characterizing the observables of a relativistic quantum theory , as no communication is possible if an operation is carried out on a spacelike slice .",
    "the existence of causal quantum operations that are not localizable establishes a perplexing gap between what is _ causal _ and what is",
    "_ local_.    in  ii , we formulate precise definitions of causal , semicausal , localizable , and semilocalizable , and we point out a large class of localizable superoperators characterized by local stabilizer groups .",
    "we describe the general structure of semicausal and causal complete measurement superoperators in  iii , show that semicausal complete measurement superoperators are semilocalizable in  iv , and exhibit some causal complete measurement superoperators that are not localizable in  v. in ",
    "vi , we exploit bounds on the strength of quantum correlations to construct another class of causal superoperators that are not localizable , and we note a connection between localizability and quantum communication complexity . we prove in  vii that a semicausal unitary transformation must be a tensor product .",
    "some further criteria for semicausality are developed in  viii , and ",
    "ix contains some concluding comments .",
    "proofs of two of our theorems are included as appendices .",
    "in this section , we formally define the properties of quantum operations that we wish to explore  causality , semicausality , localizability , and semilocalizability  and we discuss some examples that illustrate these concepts .",
    "any permissible way in which the state of a quantum system can change is described by a quantum operation , a completely positive trace - nonincreasing linear map of density operators to density operators .",
    "an important special case is a trace - preserving map , or _",
    "superoperator_. a superoperator @xmath4 can be interpreted as a generalized measurement with an unknown outcome ; its action on a density operator @xmath7 has an operator - sum representation @xmath8 where the operation elements @xmath9 obey the normalization condition @xmath10 an operation is a generalized measurement in which a particular outcome has been selected , but the density operator has not been renormalized .",
    "it too can be represented as in eq .",
    "( [ operator_sum ] ) , but where the sum over @xmath11 is restricted to a subset of a set of operators obeying eq .",
    "( [ operator_normalization ] )  that is , the eigenvalues of @xmath12 are no greater than 1 . for a general operation",
    ", @xmath13 can be interpreted as the probability of the observed outcome .",
    "every superoperator has a unitary representation . to implement the superoperator @xmath14 acting on hilbert space @xmath15",
    ", we can introduce an ancilla with hilbert space @xmath16 , prepare a pure state @xmath17 of the ancilla , perform a unitary transformation @xmath18 on @xmath19 , and then discard the ancilla : @xmath20~.\\ ] ] a general operation has a similar representation , except that after @xmath18 is applied , a ( not necessarily complete ) orthogonal measurement is carried out on the ancilla and a particular result is selected ( without renormalizing the density operator ) .",
    "but what quantum operations are physically possible ?",
    "the general answer is not known , but it _ is _ known that many operations of the form eq .",
    "( [ operator_sum ] ) are unphysical because they run afoul of relativistic causality @xcite .",
    "consider , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcone ] , two parties alice and bob who perform spacelike - separated actions . just prior to the implementation of the operation @xmath4",
    ", bob performs a local operation on the degrees of freedom in his vicinity , and just after the implementation of @xmath4 , alice performs a local measurement of the degrees of freedom in her vicinity .",
    "if alice is able to acquire any information about what local operation bob chose to apply , then bob has successfully sent a superluminal signal to alice .",
    "if a bipartite operation @xmath4 does not enable such superluminal signaling from bob to alice , then we will say that @xmath4 is _",
    "semicausal_. if @xmath4 does not allow signaling in either direction , we will say that @xmath4 is _ causal_. ( in our discussions of semicausality , we will normally adopt the convention that bob is the party attempting to send the signal and alice is the party attempting to receive it .",
    "this somewhat perverse convention is chosen in order to be consistent with the definition of semilocalizable that is introduced below . )",
    "an operation that is not semicausal is said to be _",
    "acausal_. a causal operation will sometimes be called _ fully causal _ , when we wish to emphasize the contrast with semicausality .",
    "alice s part of the bipartite system will be called `` system @xmath0 '' , with hilbert space @xmath21 , and bob s half is `` system @xmath1 '' with hilbert space @xmath22 . we consider a quantum operation @xmath4 that acts on states in @xmath23 .",
    "alice might have under her control not only @xmath0 , but also an ancilla system @xmath24 with hilbert space @xmath16 , and bob might control an ancilla system @xmath25 with hilbert space @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that bob wants to attempt to exploit the operation @xmath4 to send a signal to alice .",
    "alice and bob could share an initial density operator @xmath26 living in @xmath27 , and bob could apply a superoperator @xmath28 to his half of the state .",
    "( bob is restricted to a superoperator , rather than a trace - decreasing operation , because alice is unaware of the outcome of any measurement performed by bob . )",
    "then after the operation @xmath4 is applied , we obtain alice s final density operator by tracing over bob s system and ancilla @xmath29~.\\ ] ] here by @xmath5 we mean the operation @xmath30 that acts trivially on the ancillas .",
    "note that if @xmath4 is not trace preserving , then @xmath31 might not be normalized , in which case alice s final state is the normalized density operator @xmath32 .",
    "finally , alice performs a measurement of this state .",
    "if alice s state depends at all on the superoperator @xmath6 that bob applies , then the mutual information of bob s superoperator and alice s measurement is nonzero .",
    "hence bob can transmit classical information to alice over a noisy channel with nonzero capacity ; that is , bob can signal alice .",
    "we arrive then , at this    * definition * _ a bipartite operation @xmath4 is * semicausal * if and only if @xmath33 is independent of bob s superoperator @xmath6 for all possible choices of the shared initial state @xmath26 .",
    "_    ( excluded from consideration is the case @xmath34 , corresponding to an outcome that occurs with probability zero . )",
    "this criterion for semicausality is rather unwieldy ; fortunately it can be simplified .",
    "one useful observation is that , while in our definition of semicausality we allowed the initial state @xmath26 shared by alice and bob to be entangled , we could without loss of generality restrict their initial state to be a product state .",
    "suppose that a _ superoperator _ @xmath4 is not semicausal . then there is an initial state @xmath26 shared by alice and bob , and a superoperator @xmath6 that can be applied by bob , such that @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ne{{\\rm tr}_{bs}\\big[{\\cal e}_{ab}\\big(i_{ra}\\otimes { \\cal b}_{bs}(\\rho_{rabs})\\big)\\big ] } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now any bipartite density operator can be expanded as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are density operators of alice s and bob s systems ( including ancillas ) , respectively , and the @xmath39 s are nonvanishing real numbers .",
    "of course , if the @xmath39 s were all positive , then @xmath26 would be a separable state .",
    "but if we allow the @xmath39 s to be negative , then such an expansion exists for any state .",
    "since the superoperator @xmath4 is linear , we may rewrite eq .",
    "( [ not_one_causal ] ) as @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ne\\sum_\\mu \\lambda_\\mu ~ { { \\rm tr}_{bs}\\big[{\\cal e}\\big(\\rho_\\mu \\otimes { \\cal b}(\\sigma_\\mu)\\big)\\big ] } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be satisfied only if @xmath41\\ne   { { \\rm tr}_{bs}\\big[{\\cal e}\\big(\\rho_\\mu \\otimes { \\cal b}(\\sigma_\\mu)\\big)\\big]}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for at least one @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , if alice and bob prepare the appropriate product state @xmath42 , @xmath4 allows bob to signal alice .",
    "furthermore , since each of @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath43 can be realized as an ensemble of pure states , there is a signaling protocol in which alice s and bob s initial states are pure .",
    "once we recognize that there is a signaling protocol such that the initial state is a product state , we can see that the ancillas are superfluous .",
    "bob sends his signal by choosing one of the two pure states @xmath44 , @xmath45 ; since tracing over @xmath25 commutes with @xmath4 , we can just as well say that bob starts with a mixed state @xmath46 or @xmath47 of system @xmath1 alone .",
    "furthermore , if bob can signal alice by preparing one of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , then he must be able to do it by preparing pure states that arise in the ensemble realizations of these density operators .    finally ,",
    "if signaling is possible , then alice can receive the signal by preparing an initial pure state @xmath48 .",
    "bob s action , together with @xmath4 , subjects system @xmath0 to one of two possible operations , resulting in two distinguishable final states .",
    "but for these final states of @xmath49 to be distinguishable , the two operations must produce different outcomes acting on at least one of the _ pure _ states of @xmath0 appearing in the schmidt decomposition of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , alice could just as well dispense with @xmath24 , and prepare an initial pure state @xmath50 of @xmath0 alone .",
    "thus we have proved    * theorem 1 * _ if the bipartite superoperator @xmath4 is not semicausal , then signaling is possible with pure initial states and without ancillas : there are pure states @xmath51 and @xmath52 such that @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ne{\\rm tr}_{b}\\big[{\\cal e}\\big ( ( |\\varphi\\rangle\\langle\\varphi|)_a~\\otimes ~(|\\psi'\\rangle\\langle \\psi'|)_b\\big)\\big]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _    we note that semicausal superoperators form a convex set .",
    "if each @xmath54 is a superoperator , then so is the combination @xmath55 where the @xmath56 s are nonnegative and sum to 1 .",
    "it follows from the linearity of the @xmath54 s and the definition of semicausality that @xmath4 is semicausal if each @xmath54 is .",
    "a somewhat less obvious property is that the semicausal superoperators form a semigroup  a composition of semicausal operations is semicausal .",
    "this follows from    * theorem 2 * _ suppose that @xmath4 is a semicausal bipartite superoperator , and that the two bipartite density operators @xmath7 and @xmath57 satisfy @xmath58",
    ". then @xmath59 . _",
    "* proof * : first we note that it is possible to choose a basis of linearly independent operators acting on a hilbert space @xmath60 , such that each element of the basis is a one - dimensional projector .",
    "let @xmath61 denote such a basis for alice s hilbert space @xmath21 and let @xmath62 denote such a basis for bob s hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "then we may expand the bipartite density operators @xmath7 and @xmath57 as @xmath63 since @xmath64 , the property @xmath58 can be rewritten as @xmath65 , which implies , since the @xmath66 s are a basis , that @xmath67 for each @xmath11 .    applying the superoperator @xmath4",
    ", we find that @xmath68 furthermore , since each @xmath69 is a pure state , a unitary transformation applied by bob can transform any one of the @xmath69 s to any other ; therefore the semicausality of @xmath4 implies that the operator @xmath70 is independent of @xmath71 .",
    "denoting this operator by @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 eq .",
    "( [ alpha_sum ] ) then implies that @xmath74 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "the semigroup property of semicausal superoperators is a simple    * corollary * _ if @xmath75 and @xmath76 are semicausal bipartite superoperators , then their composition @xmath77 is also semicausal . _    * proof * : suppose that the bipartite density operator @xmath7 can be transformed to @xmath57 by a superoperator applied by bob .",
    "then the semicausality of @xmath75 implies that @xmath78 , and theorem 2 applied to @xmath76 implies that @xmath79 ; therefore @xmath80 is semicausal .",
    "physics is local .",
    "if a physical system has many parts that are remote from one another , then the evolution of the system is governed by local `` parties '' that act on the different parts of the system separately . in particular ,",
    "since communication outside the light cone is impossible , the operations that can be applied to a physical system at a fixed time are those that require no communication among the local parties .",
    "we call an operation of this type _ localizable_.    although they are not permitted to communicate , the parties are free to exploit any resources that might have been prepared in advance .",
    "in particular , they are permitted to have a shared ancilla that might be in an entangled quantum state , and to consume their shared entanglement in the course of executing their operation .    in the case of a system with two parts , one controlled by alice , the other by bob",

    "localizable superoperators form a convex set . to see this",
    ", we note that with shared entanglement , alice and bob can simulate shared randomness ( a weaker resource ) .",
    "for example , suppose they share an ancilla prepared in the state @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an orthonormal basis for alice s hilbert space @xmath16 , @xmath89 is an orthonormal basis for bob s hilbert space @xmath15 , and the @xmath56 s are nonnegative real numbers that sum to one . then if alice and bob both perform measurements that project onto these bases , each obtains the outcome @xmath90 with probability @xmath56 .",
    "now let @xmath91 be a set of localizable operations .",
    "alice and bob can consult their shared randomness , and then carry out a local protocol that applies the operation @xmath54 with probability @xmath56 , thus achieving a local implementation of the convex sum @xmath92 .",
    "of course , a superoperator is surely localizable if it is a tensor product of superoperators applied by alice and by bob , @xmath93 . by convexity ,",
    "any superoperator of the form @xmath94 is also localizable .",
    "there are some less obvious examples of localizable operations , as we will soon see .",
    "we are also interested in bipartite operations that can be implemented with communication in just one direction .",
    "we call such operations _ semilocalizable_. in our discussions of semilocalizability , we will normally adopt the convention that alice is permitted to send quantum information to bob , but bob can not send anything to alice .",
    "a semilocalizable operation is one that can be performed in principle if bob s action is in the forward light cone of alice s action .",
    "we could , equivalently , provide alice and bob with prior shared entanglement , and restrict them to classical communication .",
    "these two notions of semilocalizability are equivalent because prior entanglement and classical communication from alice to bob enable alice to teleport quantum information to bob .",
    "conversely , if alice can send qubits to bob , she can establish shared entanglement with him , and she can send him classical messages .",
    "an operation that is not semilocalizable is said to be _",
    "unlocalizable_. a localizable operation will sometimes be called _ fully localizable _ , when we wish to emphasize the contrast with semilocalizability .",
    "if alice can send quantum information to bob , then alice and bob both have access to the same ancilla : alice performs a local operation on the ancilla and her half of the shared state , she sends the ancilla to bob , and then bob performs a local operation on the ancilla and his half of the state .",
    "thus we arrive at this    * definition * _ a bipartite operation @xmath4 is * semilocalizable * if and only if @xmath95\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some ancilla state @xmath96 , where @xmath83 is an operation and @xmath97 is a superoperator .",
    "_    note that the product @xmath98 is a composition of operations ( with alice s operation acting first ) , not a tensor product ; the operations do not commute because they act on the same ancilla .",
    "we have allowed alice to apply an operation that is not necessarily trace preserving , since alice can perform a measurement whose outcome is known to both alice and bob , but bob is restricted to a superoperator because the outcome of a measurement that he performs is not known by alice . if the operation @xmath4 is a superoperator , then",
    "so must be @xmath83 , and in fact we can take @xmath97 and @xmath83 to be unitary transformations without loss of generality .",
    "an obvious consequence of this definition is that semilocalizable ( or localizable ) superoperators form a semigroup : @xmath77 is semilocalizable if @xmath75 and @xmath76 are both semilocalizable .",
    "one of our goals is to characterize the _",
    "observables _ of a relativistic quantum theory : what self - adjoint operators are really measurable ?",
    "when we speak of a `` measurement '' of an observable whose support is on a time slice , we need not require that the measurement outcome be instantaneously known by anyone .",
    "we might imagine instead that many parties distributed over the slice perform simultaneous local operations .",
    "later the data collected by the parties can be assembled and processed at a central location to determine the measurement result .",
    "then we may say that the operation performed on the slice is a measurement with an unknown outcome .",
    "if @xmath99 is the set of orthogonal projectors onto the eigenspaces of the observable , the effect of this operation on a density operator @xmath7 is @xmath100 we will call a ( trace - preserving ) operation of this form an _ orthogonal measurement superoperator_. in the special case where each projector @xmath101 is one - dimensional , it is a _",
    "complete orthogonal measurement superoperator _ , or just a complete measurement superoperator .",
    "the causality and localizability properties of complete measurement superoperators will be extensively discussed in the next few sections .",
    "first , let s clarify the concept of semicausality by pointing out an example , noted by sorkin @xcite , of an incomplete measurement superoperator that is not semicausal .",
    "it is a two - outcome incomplete bell measurement performed on a pair of qubits .",
    "the orthogonal projectors corresponding to the two outcomes are @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "suppose that the initial pure state shared by alice and bob is @xmath104 .",
    "this state is orthogonal to @xmath105 , so that outcome 2 occurs with probability one , and the state is unmodified by the superoperator .",
    "afterwards alice still has a density operator @xmath106 .",
    "but what if , before the superoperator acts , bob performs a unitary that rotates the state to @xmath107 ?",
    "since this state is an equally weighted superposition of @xmath105 and @xmath108 , the two outcomes occur equiprobably , and in either case the final state is maximally entangled , so that alice s density operator afterwards is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes the identity .",
    "alice can make a measurement that has a good chance of distinguishing the density operators @xmath111 and @xmath112 , so that she can decipher a message sent by bob . by a similar method ,",
    "alice can send a signal to bob .",
    "the measurement superoperator is acausal .    on the other hand ,",
    "some orthogonal measurement superoperators are causal .",
    "for example , measurement of a tensor product observable @xmath113 is obviously causal .",
    " alice and bob can induce decoherence in the basis of eigenstates of a tensor product through only local actions .",
    "but there are other examples of causal measurement superoperators that are a bit less obvious .",
    "one is complete bell measurement , _",
    "i.e. _ decoherence in the bell basis @xmath114 , and she ca nt extract any information about bob s activities .    though bell measurement is a causal operation , it is not something that alice and bob can achieve locally without additional resources .",
    "but the bell measurement superoperator is localizable  alice and bob can implement it if they share an entangled ancilla .",
    "in fact , shared randomness , a weaker resource than entanglement , is sufficient for this purpose @xcite .",
    "suppose that alice and bob share a pair of qubits , and also share a string of random bits .",
    "at a particular time , they both consult two bits of the random string ; depending on whether they read @xmath115 or @xmath116 , they both apply the unitary operator @xmath117 or @xmath118 , where @xmath110 is the identity , and @xmath119 are the @xmath120 pauli matrices @xmath121 together , then , alice and bob apply the superoperator @xmath122~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the four bell states are simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( and therefore also @xmath125 ) with eigenvalues @xmath126 :",
    "@xmath124 specifies a parity bit that distinguishes @xmath127 from @xmath128 and @xmath123 specifies a phase bit that distinguishes @xmath129 from @xmath130 .",
    "hence we easily verify that @xmath4 preserves each of the four bell basis states , and annihilates all the terms in @xmath7 that are off the diagonal in the bell basis .",
    "the bell measurement superoperator can be viewed as a refinement , or `` completion , '' of the acausal incomplete measurement superoperator of eq .",
    "( [ sorkin ] )  that is , bell measurement is obtained by resolving the three - dimensional projector @xmath131 of eq .",
    "( [ sorkin ] ) into a sum of three mutually orthogonal one - dimensional projectors .",
    "thus , this example illustrates that a completion of an acausal measurement superoperator can sometimes be causal . on the other hand , there are other ways of refining the superoperator of eq .",
    "( [ sorkin ] ) that yield acausal complete measurement superoperators .",
    "for example , the two - qubit superoperator with projectors @xmath132 is easily seen to be acausal by applying the criterion of theorem 3 below .",
    "in fact , it is a general feature that if an orthogonal measurement superoperator @xmath4 allows bob to signal alice , then there exists a completion of @xmath4 that also allows signaling , with the same signal states @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this result is proved in @xcite .",
    "since the bell measurement superoperator can be implemented with shared randomness , one may wonder whether shared randomness is sufficient for the implementation of arbitrary localizable superoperators .",
    "but it is easy to think of localizable superoperators for which shared randomness does not suffice  shared entanglement is necessary . for example",
    ", alice and bob can locally perform a two - qubit operation in which they throw their qubits away , and replace them with a @xmath105 drawn from their shared ancilla .",

    "we have studied the constraints on quantum operations that are imposed by relativistic causality . in the bipartite",
    "setting where no classical communication is permitted , we find a hierarchy of operations :    ( 1 ) : :    operations that can be implemented with no shared resources , ( 2 ) : :    operations that can be implemented with shared randomness , ( 3 ) : :    operations that can be implemented with shared entanglement    ( localizable operations ) , ( 4 ) : :    causal operations , ( 5 ) : :    acausal operations .",
    "our central observation is that the classes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) do not coincide : there are operations that respect causality , but are nonetheless forbidden by the rules of local quantum physics .",
    "our work can be regarded as a useful step toward the broader goal of characterizing the physically realizable operations in relativistic quantum field theory . however , as noted in the sec .",
    "i , to apply our results to field theory one must accept the idealization that the resources shared by the parties are external probes not themselves described by the field theory .    in a separate paper",
    ", we have also discussed causality constraints that apply to non - abelian gauge theories @xcite ; we have shown that the _ nondemolition _ measurement of a spacelike wilson loop operator is an acausal operation ( confirming a speculation of sorkin @xcite ) , and is therefore surely not localizable . on the other hand ,",
    "a _ destructive _ measurement of a wilson loop is possible  spacelike separated parties can perform a povm from which the value of the wilson loop can be inferred , but this povm will damage wilson loop eigenstates .",
    "the compatibility of quantum mechanics with special relativity is highly nontrivial ; in fact , it is something of a miracle .",
    "because relativistic quantum field theories are so highly constrained , it is tempting to speculate that `` quantum mechanics is the way it is because any small changes in quantum mechanics would lead to absurdities '' @xcite .    from this perspective",
    ", the existence of causal operations that are not localizable comes as a surprise .",
    "we seem to have the freedom to relax the rules of quantum theory by allowing more general operations , without encountering unacceptable physical consequences .",
    "nontrivial support for this notion is provided by the semigroup property of the causal operations .",
    "it is reasonable to insist that the operations allowed at a given time ought not to depend on the previous history of the system ; since the composition of two causal operations is causal , a theory that admits more general causal operations than those allowed in local quantum theory could adhere to this proviso .",
    "one wonders whether there are further principles , beyond relativistic causality , that will restrict the class of allowed operations to those and only those that are truly realizable in nature .",
    "if so , these principles might lead us to an understanding of why quantum mechanics has to be the way it is . what might these principles be ?",
    "we do nt know .",
    "but the discussion in  vi invites us to contemplate the fundamental limitations on the correlations among the parts of a physical system . experimentally confirmed violations of the chsh inequality demonstrate that the correlations are stronger than those allowed by any local hidden variable theory .",
    "operations that are causal but not localizable produce correlations that are stronger still , and violate the cirelson inequality .",
    "what criteria point toward a description of nature that incorporates violation of the chsh inequality , but not violation of the cirelson inequality ?    or could it be that nature really does allow more general operations , and that the conventional framework of local quantum physics needs revision ? ultimately , only experiment can decide .",
