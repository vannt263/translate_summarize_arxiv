    "today , with a vast amount of publications being produced in every discipline of scientific research , it can be rather overwhelming to select a good quality work ; that is enriched with original ideas and relevant to scientific community .",
    "more often this type of publications are discovered through the citation mechanism .",
    "it is believed that an estimate measure for scientific credibility of a paper is the number of citations that it receives , though this should not be taken too literally since some publications may have gone unnoticed or have been forgotten about over time .",
    "knowledge of how many times their publications are cited can be seen as good feedback for the authors , which brings about an unspoken demand for the statistical analysis of citation data .",
    "one of the impressive empirical studies on citation distribution of scientific publications @xcite showed that the distribution is a power - law form with exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the power - law behaviour in this complex system is a consequence of highly cited papers being more likely to acquire further citations .",
    "this was identified as a _ preferential attachment _ process in @xcite .    the citation distribution of scientific publications is well studied and",
    "there exist a number of network models @xcite to mimic its complex structure and empirical results @xcite to confirm predictions .",
    "however , they seem to concentrate on the total number of citations without giving information about the issuing publications .",
    "the scientific publications belonging to a particular research area do not restrict their references to that discipline only , they form bridges by comparing or confirming findings in other research fields .",
    "for instance most _ small world network models _",
    "@xcite presented in statistical mechanics , reference a sociometry article @xcite which presents the studies of milgram on the small world problem .",
    "this is the type of process which we will investigate with a simple model that only considers two research areas and referencing within and across each other .",
    "the consideration of cross linking also makes the model applicable to _ the web of human sexual contacts _",
    "@xcite , where the interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the proceeding section the model is defined and analyzed with a rate equation approach @xcite . in the final section discussions and comparisons of findings with the existing data are presented .",
    "one can visualize the proposed model with the aid of fig .",
    "( [ coupled ] ) that attempts to illustrate the growth mechanism .",
    "we build the model by the following considerations .    initially , both networks @xmath1 and @xmath2 contains @xmath3 nodes with no cross - links between the nodes in the networks .",
    "at each time step two new nodes with no incoming links , one belonging to network @xmath1 and the other to @xmath2 , are introduced simultaneously .",
    "the new node joining to @xmath1 with @xmath4 outgoing links , attaches @xmath5 fraction of its links to pre - existing nodes in @xmath1 and @xmath6 fraction of them to pre - existing nodes in @xmath2 .",
    "the similar process takes place when a new node joins to @xmath2 , where the new node has @xmath7 outgoing links from which @xmath8 of them goes to nodes in @xmath2 and the complementary @xmath9 goes to @xmath1 .",
    "the attachments to nodes in either networks are preferential and the rate of acquiring a link depends on the number of connections and the initial attractiveness of the pre - existing nodes .",
    "we define @xmath10 as the average number of nodes with total @xmath11 number of connections that includes the incoming intra - links @xmath12 and the incoming cross - links @xmath13 in network @xmath1 at time @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , @xmath15 is the average number of nodes with @xmath16 connections at time @xmath14 in network @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the indices are discriminative and the order in which they are used is important , as they indicate the direction that the links are made .",
    "further more we also define @xmath17 and @xmath18 the average number of nodes with @xmath12 and @xmath19 incoming intra - links to @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "finally , we also have @xmath20 and @xmath21 to denote the average number of nodes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath13 and @xmath22 incoming cross - links .",
    "to keep this paper less cumbersome we will only analyse the time evolution of network @xmath1 and apply our results to network @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to this , we only need to give the time evolution of @xmath23 , defined as the joint distribution of intra - links and cross - links . using this distribution",
    "we can find all other distributions that are mentioned earlier .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath23 can be described by a rate equation @xmath24\\nonumber\\\\ & & + p_{ba}m_{b}[(k_{aa}+k_{ba}-1+a)n_{a}(k_{aa},k_{ba}-1,t)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -(k_{aa}+k_{ba}+a)n_{a}(k_{aa},k_{ba},t)]\\}+ \\delta_{k_{aa}0}\\delta_{k_{ba}0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the form of the eq .",
    "( [ na ] ) seems very similar to the one used in @xcite . in that model",
    "the rate of creating links depends on the out - degree of the issuing nodes and the in - degree of the target nodes .",
    "here we are concerned with two different types of in - degrees namely intra- and cross - links of the nodes .    on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ na ] ) the terms in first square brackets represent the increase in the number of nodes with @xmath11 links when a node with @xmath25 intra - links acquires a new intra - link and if the node already has @xmath11 links this leads to reduction in the number .",
    "similarly , for the second square brackets where the number of nodes with @xmath11 links changes due to the incoming cross - links .",
    "the final term accounts for the continuous addition of new nodes with no incoming links , each new node could be thought of as the new publication in a particular research discipline .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath26 sum of all degrees is defined as    @xmath27    we limit ourself to the case of preferential linear attachment rate@xcite @xmath28 shifted by @xmath29 , the initial attractiveness @xcite of nodes in @xmath1 , which ensures that there is a nonzero probability of any node acquiring a link .",
    "the nature of @xmath30 lets one to obtain , as @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average total in - degree in network @xmath1 .",
    "( [ mat ] ) implying that @xmath26 is linear in time .",
    "similarly , it is easy to show that @xmath34 is also linear function of time .",
    "we use these relations in eq .",
    "( [ na ] ) to obtain the time independent recurrence relation    @xmath35n_{a}(k_{aa},k_{ba})\\nonumber\\\\ = p_{aa}m_{a}(k_{aa}+k_{ba}+a-1)n_{a}(k_{aa}-1,k_{ba})\\nonumber\\\\ + p_{ba}m_{b}(k_{aa}+k_{ba}+a-1)n_{a}(k_{aa},k_{ba}-1)\\nonumber\\\\ + ( a+<m_{a}>)\\delta_{k_{aa}0}\\delta_{k_{ba}0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expression in eq .",
    "( [ arec ] ) does not simplify however , it lets us to obtain the total in - degree distribution @xmath36 writing @xmath37 and since @xmath38 then @xmath39 satisfies @xmath40n_{a}(k_{a})=<m_{a}>(k_{a}+a-1)n_{a}(k_{a}-1 ) \\nonumber\\\\ + ( a+<m_{a}>)\\delta_{k_{a}0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving eq .",
    "( [ narec ] ) for @xmath41 yields , @xmath42 with @xmath43    as @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ nagamma ] ) gives the asymptotic behaviour of the total in - degree distribution in @xmath1 @xmath45 which is a power - law form with an exponent @xmath46 that only depends on the average total in - degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes .",
    "similarly , we can write the total in - degree distribution in network @xmath2 for the asymptotic limit of @xmath47 as @xmath48 again , the exponent depends upon the initial attractiveness @xmath49 of nodes and the average total incoming links @xmath50 .",
    "we now move on to analyse @xmath17 , the distribution of the average number of nodes with @xmath12 intra - links in network @xmath1 . in citation network",
    "one can think of these links being issued from the same subject class as the receiving nodes and in the case of human sexual contact network , they represent the homosexual interactions . since @xmath51 which can also be written as @xmath52 , a linear function of time . then summing eq .",
    "( [ arec ] ) over all possible values of @xmath13 @xmath53 we get @xmath54n_{aa}(k_{aa})+<m_{a } > \\sum_{k_{ba}=0}^{\\infty}k_{ba}n_{a}(k_{aa},k_{ba})\\nonumber\\\\ = p_{aa}m_{a}(k_{aa}+a-1)n_{aa}(k_{aa}-1)+p_{aa}m_{a } \\sum_{k_{ba}=0}^{\\infty}k_{ba}n_{a}(k_{aa}-1,k_{ba})\\nonumber\\\\ + p_{ba}m_{b}(k_{aa}+a)n_{aa}(k_{aa})+p_{ba}m_{b } \\sum_{k_{ba}=0}^{\\infty}(k_{ba}-1)n_{a}(k_{aa},k_{ba}-1)\\nonumber\\\\ + ( a+<m_{a}>)\\delta_{k_{aa}0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large @xmath12 eq .",

    "( [ aagamma ] ) has a power - law form @xmath60 that depends upon both @xmath5 and the coupling parameter @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , the time independent recurrence relation for @xmath18 has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ aarec ] ) with the only difference being the parameters .",
    "therefore we will simply give the power - law distribution @xmath62 where the other coupling parameter @xmath63 is revealed in the exponent .",
    "finally , the distribution of average number of nodes with incoming cross - links @xmath20 in @xmath1 can be found by summing over @xmath23 for all its intra - links @xmath64 as before @xmath65 is also linear in time . when the cross links @xmath13 are large enough , then from eq .",
    "( [ arec ] ) we obtain    @xmath66    where @xmath67 in the asymptotic limit as @xmath68 the distribution @xmath69 has a power - law form and similarly for the network @xmath2 as @xmath68 @xmath70 unlike the case in intra - links , here the exponents are inversely proportional to the coupled parameters @xmath61 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we set the number of outgoing links of the new nodes in either networks to be the same , i.e. @xmath71 . furthermore taking the rate of cross linking to be @xmath72 and the rate of intra linking @xmath73 , consequently we have @xmath74 , and @xmath75 as the coupling parameter .    in the weak coupling case ,",
    "the cross linking is negligibly small i.e. @xmath76 then the power - law exponent of the intra - link distribution is @xmath77 equal to total link distribution @xmath78 .",
    "this gives a solution obtained in@xcite and when @xmath79 we recover the exponent @xmath80 , the empirical findings in @xcite .",
    "thus , varying @xmath75 in @xmath83 yields any values of @xmath84 between @xmath85 and @xmath86 . on the contrary ,",
    "the exponent of cross - link distribution @xmath87 decreases from @xmath86 to @xmath88 , as @xmath75 increases from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "taking @xmath79 gives @xmath91 supposing @xmath92 , which seems reasonable for consideration of citation networks , we find that @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the former result coincides with the distribution of connectivities for the electric power grid of southern california @xcite . where the system is small and the local interactions is of importance hence there seems to be some analogy to the intra - linking process .",
    "for the latter , as far as we are aware there is none empirical studies present in the published literature .    now , consider the web of human sexual contacts@xcite .",
    "if we let @xmath1 to represent males and @xmath2 females that is @xmath95 and @xmath96 then @xmath97 are the power - law exponents of the degree distributions of the sexes .",
    "where @xmath98 and @xmath49 denote the male and female attractiveness respectively and usually @xmath99 is considered @xcite . by setting @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath81 that is , cross links are predominant then as in @xcite we obtain @xmath102 for males and @xmath103 for females .",
    "the exponents @xmath104 and @xmath105 have been observed for the cumulative distributions in empirical study @xcite .",
    "the model we studied here seems to have the flexibility to represent variety of complex systems .",
