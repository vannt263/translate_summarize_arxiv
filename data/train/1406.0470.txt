    "supercapacitors , also called ultracapacitors or electrochemical double layer capacitors ( edlcs ) , bridge the gap between batteries and conventional dielectric capacitors @xcite .",
    "the most common electrode material is carbon - based and include activated carbon @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , and graphene @xcite . to go beyond electrostatic charge storage in the double layer ,",
    "pseudocapacitive and faradaic components ( `` faradaic components '' henceforth ) such as conducting polymers and metal oxides were incorporated into supercapacitors @xcite .",
    "two ways of incorporating the faradaic material have been employed , both in an asymmetric ( or hybrid ) configuration where : ( 1 ) a carbon electrode and a faradaic electrode form the two electrodes of a supercapacitor @xcite ; ( 2 ) at least one of the electrodes is a composite material that combines advantages of electrochemical double layer charge storage as well as surface redox or intercalation charge storage @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) have a high aspect ratio and form porous networks with good conductivity . as such",
    ", they have been implemented as supercapacitor electrodes in many instances in the literature @xcite .",
    "titanium oxide is a versatile compound and can be found in several energy harvesting and energy storage applications , namely photocatalysis , secondary batteries , and supercapacitors @xcite . among the three polymorphs of tio@xmath0",
    ", the crystal structure of anatase can accommodate the most li+ per tio@xmath0 unit and is an attractive energy storage material due to its li - intercalation capabilities and cycle life @xcite .",
    "tio@xmath0 nanowires have been synthesized by hydrothermal methods , functioning as the anode of a supercapacitor with carbon nanotubes acting as the cathode @xcite .",
    "these are type ( 1 ) asymmetric supercapacitors .    in this study ,",
    "the application of a nanocomposite containing tio@xmath0 nanoparticles and multiwall carbon nanotubes in a single supercapacitor electrode is reported .",
    "results from conventional as well as new electrochemical characterization methods show not only the various aspects of the energy storage mechanism in the electrode but also the combination of double layer and faradaic capacitance as a synergy that leads to high energy density and good power density in a single electrode .",
    "cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) as well as galvanostatic cycling ( gc ) were performed on the cnt - tio@xmath0 composite electrodes .",
    "cyclic voltammetry of the composite electrode at various scan rates was measured in 1 m liclo@xmath1 in propylene carbonate with lithium metal sheets as the reference electrode and counter electrode , shown in figure 1 .",
    "the voltage window was 1 v to 2.6 v vs. li / li+ .",
    "a series of galvanostatic measurements were also performed , two of which are shown in figure 2 .",
    "composite electrode at various scan rates in 1 m liclo@xmath1 in propylene carbonate with lithium metal sheets as the reference electrode and counter electrode . ]",
    "composite electrode with applied currents densities 0.71 a / g and 3.6 a / g . ]",
    "the electrode capacitance is given by @xmath2 and the specific capacitance by @xmath3 .",
    "the storage capacity of the composite electrode decreases with increasing current but approaches a constant value , shown in figure 3 along with the coulombic efficiency .",
    "the galvanostatic charging for a given current @xmath4 is described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the capacitance of the electrode and @xmath7 is the internal resistance .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath9 , is the voltage drop at the beginning of charging and discharging cycles .",
    "the temporal slope @xmath10 plotted as a function of the potential is shown in figure 4 .",
    "these plots will be called temporal slope voltammograms ( tsvs ) in this article .",
    "similar to cvs , the anodic peaks and cathodic peaks shift as the applied current increases .",
    "however , whereas the faradaic / intercalation peaks flatten as the scan rates increase in cvs , the temporal slope peaks remain sharp even for large current densities .        as shown in figure 5a , as @xmath9 vanishes , both anodic and cathodic peak potentials approach the same value , the standard potential for the intercalation reaction . a plot of the temporal slope peaks versus @xmath11 shows a linear relationship ( figure 5b ) .",
    "linear regression gives the peak capacitances at @xmath12 , 2410 f / g for li extraction and 1450 f / g for li insertion .",
    "as a point of reference , the theoretical specific capacitance of tio@xmath0 assuming one li+ ion per tio@xmath0 molecule is 2295 f / g , calculated using the formula @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the faraday constant and @xmath15 is the tio@xmath0 molar mass .",
    "the peak capacitance at the standard potential of the faradaic reaction could be an important figure of merit in characterizing and optimizing nanocomposites as the mass normalized quantity is nearly independent of the double layer contributions .",
    "in addition to temporal slope voltammograms , a new method to distinguish between electrostatic and faradaic contributions to the energy storage capacity warrants discussion . the distinction is important because one is often interested in the effect of nanoparticle size on the faradaic reactions and whether the faradaic process involves only surface sites or the bulk @xcite .",
    "the differential form of the capacitor equation    @xmath16    includes both capacitor behavior , where the capacitance is a constant that depends only on the capacitor13s geometry and dielectric material , and battery behavior , where the potential is ideally constant and the storage capacity varies linearly with the state of charge . in the case where the potential is the experimentally tunable parameter , charge conservation requires    @xmath17    the current associated with changes in the double layer is given by @xmath18 and the current due to reversible charge transfer reactions at the electrode surface is described by @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the starting ion concentration at the electrode - electrolyte interface , @xmath22 is the width of the diffusion layer , @xmath23 is the area of the tio@xmath0 nanoparticles , and @xmath24 is the standard potential of the reaction .",
    "it follows that the charge stored is    @xmath25    the charge accumulation as a function of potential can be obtained from galvanostatic measurements , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "the double layer capacitance can be obtained from the slope of @xmath26 for sufficiently large potentials , after available tio@xmath0 lattice sites are fully intercalated .    .",
    "the anodic and cathodic intercepts are both 1.9 v. ( b ) temporal slope peaks are linear in @xmath11 .",
    "the absolute values of the two linear regression slopes yield peak capacitances . ]",
    "dielectric capacitors experience changes in potential at a constant storage capacity , whereas batteries experience changes in the storage capacity at a constant potential .",
    "the methods outlined in this article enable researchers to electrochemically characterize nanocomposites that exhibit both capacitor - like and battery - like behaviors .",
    "the performance of the cnt - tio@xmath0 electrode can be compared to lithium - ion batteries and other electrochemical capacitors in the form of a ragone chart , shown in figure 7 .",
    "the storage capacity and the voltage range can be converted to energy density and power density with the formulas    @xmath27    the synergy between the two materials gives rise to high energy and good power . from the perspective of the high energy density li - intercalation material , namely the tio@xmath0 nanoparticles , the addition of carbon nanotubes led to a significant increase in power density .",
