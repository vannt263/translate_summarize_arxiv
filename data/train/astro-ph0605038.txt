    "reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is used to characterize the size of the broad - line region ( blr ) in these objects by measuring the time delay between continuum changes and the response of the emission lines . by combining the reverberation time delay , or `` lag , '' with the width of the variable part of the emission line , it is possible to estimate the mass of the central object , presumably a supermassive black hole , under the assumption that the dynamics of the blr gas are dominated by gravity . in this case",
    ", the mass is given by @xmath5 where the size of the blr is given by the light - travel time @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the emission - line time delay , @xmath8 is the width of the emission line , @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath10 is a factor of order unity that depends on the geometry , kinematics , and inclination of the blr .",
    "two lines of evidence argue that the reverberation - based mass estimates have some veracity :    1 .",
    "different emission lines have different response times , and these are inversely correlated with line width in a manner consistent with a virialized blr , i.e. , @xmath11 ( peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 ; onken & peterson 2002 ; kollatschny 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , at least in the particularly well - studied case of the h@xmath12 line in ngc  5548 , the lag and line width change over time in response to luminosity changes , and the virial relationship seems to be preserved ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ; cackett & horne 2006 ) .",
    "2 .   there is a relationship between the reverberation - based black hole mass @xmath13 and host - galaxy bulge velocity dispersion @xmath14 that is consistent with the same correlation , the @xmath13@xmath14 relationship , that is observed in quiescent galaxies ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .  2000a , b ; ferrarese et al .  2001",
    "; tremaine et al .  2002 ; onken et al .  2003 , 2004 ; nelson et al .",
    "2004 ) .    with respect to the second point ,",
    "the consistency of the @xmath13@xmath14 relationship between agns and quiescent galaxies allows us to calibrate the reverberation - based mass scale to that of quiescent galaxies by determining a statistical mean value for the scaling constant @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , as was done by onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "reverberation results also show that there is a simple relationship between the size of the blr @xmath15 and luminosity @xmath16 of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , but depends somewhat on the luminosity measure and also , presumably , the particular emission line for which @xmath19 is measured ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , 2005 ; bentz et al .",
    "this is an especially important result , since the mass of the black hole in any agn can then be estimated through a single measurement of luminosity and line width , thus enabling mass estimates for large populations of agns ( wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; vestergaard 2002 , 2004 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; kollmeier et al .",
    "2006 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping is currently the only broadly applicable method by which we can directly measure agn black hole masses and it holds future promise because it is the only direct method of black hole mass measurement that does not depend on angular resolution .",
    "moreover , reverberation - based mass measurements anchor the calibration for masses based on radius ",
    "luminosity scaling relationships .",
    "thus , given the importance of the reverberation results , we have undertaken a variety of programs designed to improve the reverberation measurements from existing data , in addition to carrying out new reverberation - mapping experiments .",
    "these efforts have included compilation and consistent reanalysis of most existing reverberation data ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the particular case of ngc  3783",
    ", we completely remeasured and reanalyzed the data obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ using improved spectral extractions ( onken & peterson 2002 ) , which resulted in a remarkable improvement in the precision of the central black hole mass . in this contribution , we undertake a similar reanalysis on the _ iue _ spectra of ngc  4151 , motivated at least in part by the fact that ngc  4151 is one of the few agns in which measurement of the black hole mass by other means is plausible , which would thus enable a direct comparison between masses measured by reverberation and those measured by other direct methods .    in this contribution , we re - examine spectra from two ultraviolet monitoring campaigns undertaken with _ iue _ in 1988 ( clavel et al .",
    "1990 ) and in 1991 ( ulrich & horne 1996 ) , and compare the results with those from two ground - based optical monitoring programs that were reanalyzed by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . a third ultraviolet monitoring program on ngc  4151 in 1993 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1996 ) is not revisited here because the program was too short ( 9.3 days ) to yield meaningful results on the emission - line responses . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the processing and measurement of the ultraviolet spectra .",
    "our reverberation analysis is described in section 3 , and in section 4 we discuss our measurement of the black hole mass .",
    "our conclusions appear in section 5 .",
    "the databases for both _ iue _",
    "monitoring programs consist of multiple observations made with the short wavelength prime ( swp ) and long wavelength prime ( lwp ) cameras in the low - dispersion mode with a large ( @xmath20 ) oval aperture .",
    "the swp spectra cover the wavelength range 1150  to 2000 , while the lwp spectra cover the range 1800  to 3300 , although the lwp spectra are nearly worthless shortward of about 2200 .",
    "the first data set that we examine was obtained during the period 1988 november 29 to 1989 january 30 and is comprised of 33 swp and 22 lwp spectra ( clavel et al .",
    "the second set was obtained between 1991 november 9 and december 15 , and is comprised of 44 swp and 37 lwp spectra ( ulrich & horne 1996 ) .",
    "the original spectral images were processed with new spectral image processing system ( newsips ) , replacing the older _ iue _ spectral image processing system ( iuesips ) extractions that were used in the original analysis .",
    "compared to the iuesips spectra , the newsips spectra have improved photometric accuracy and higher signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath21 ) ; agn spectra processed with newsips show a 10%50% increase in @xmath21 ( onken & peterson 2002 and references therein )",
    ".    measurements were made of each of the swp and lwp spectra .",
    "the continuum flux was measured in the swp spectra over a 30  bandpass centered on 1355  in the observed frame .",
    "emission - line fluxes were measured by defining nominally line - free regions bracketing the lines , fitting a linear continuum between these regions and measuring the flux above the interpolated continuum .",
    "the wavelengths of the continuum fitting regions and the limits of the line integration are given for four emission lines , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ] @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , in table 1 .",
    "we did not include measurements of the ly@xmath22+@xmath23 complex because this spectral region is hopelessly contaminated by geocoronal ly@xmath24 emission .",
    "we also attempted to measure the flux in the @xmath25 feature , but the results were very poor because the line is so weak .",
    "these measurements were discarded .",
    "there were a few spectra in which the measured fluxes deviated strongly from more plausible values obtained from redundant spectra obtained at the same epoch ( i.e. , during the same 8-hour observing shift ) .",
    "we are not always able to identify specific causes of these deviant points ; some effects , such as grazing - incidence cosmic rays , are notoriously difficult to remove from _ iue _",
    "spectra through the standard pipeline processing methods such as newsips .",
    "we elected to simply remove the strongly deviant values from the light curves before processing .",
    "the measurements of the continuum and emission - line fluxes used in this analysis are given in tables 25 .",
    "multiple measurements that were obtained within a single 8-hour _ iue _ observing shift were compared to determine uncertainties in the fluxes on the assumption that no real detectable variability occurred on such short time scales . following this ,",
    "data points obtained in a single shift were replaced by a weighted average to form the final light curves shown in the left - hand columns of figs .",
    "12 and which were used as the basis for the time - series analysis described in  3.1 .",
    "the statistical properties of these light curves are summarized in table 6 .",
    "column ( 1 ) identifies the spectral feature and column ( 2 ) gives the total number of measurements in the time series .",
    "the average and median intervals between individual data points are given in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , respectively .",
    "the mean flux and its standard deviation appear in column ( 5 ) .",
    "the mean fractional error , based on comparison of closely spaced observations , is given in column ( 6 ) .",
    "column ( 7 ) gives the `` excess variance '' for each light curve , computed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the variance of all of the fluxes , @xmath28 is the mean square uncertainty of the fluxes and @xmath29 is the mean flux for all observations .",
    "also listed in column ( 8) is @xmath30 , the ratio of the maximum and minimum fluxes for each time series .",
    "to find the time delay between the continuum and emission - line variations , we cross - correlate each of the emission - line light curves with that of the 1355  continuum .",
    "the methodology we employ is the interpolation correlation function method as described by white & peterson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) for the emission lines are shown in the right - hand columns of figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "in order to assess uncertainties in the time - delay measurements , we employ the model - independent monte carlo fr / rss method described by peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , with some modifications introduced by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which works as follows . for a single realization , a light curve of @xmath31 data points",
    "is sampled @xmath31 times without regard to whether or not any given point has been previously selected ; this is called `` random subset sampling , '' or rss .",
    "any data point that is selected @xmath32 times has its uncertainty in flux reduced by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "the fluxes in each of the selected @xmath31 points are altered by random gaussian deviates based on their adopted error bars ; we refer to this as `` flux randomization , '' or fr",
    ". the subset of these points , sampled and altered by the fr / rss algorithm , are then cross - correlated as though they were real data .",
    "this yields a ccf like those seen in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "we locate the peak value @xmath34 of the ccf , which occurs at a time lag @xmath35 .",
    "we also compute the centroid of the ccf , @xmath36 , based on those points near the peak with values @xmath37 .",
    "a large number of such monte carlo realizations builds up a cross - correlation peak distribution ( ccpd ) for @xmath35 and a cross - correlation centroid distribution ( cccd ) for @xmath36 . as argued elsewhere",
    ", @xmath36 is more repeatable and has a clearer physical interpretation , so we prefer it to @xmath35 . we thus take the average values of the cccd and ccpd to be @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively . the uncertainties",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are computed such that 15.87% of the cccd realizations have values @xmath40 and 15.87% of the cccd realizations have values @xmath41 , with the errors in @xmath35 defined similarly .",
    "these uncertainties correspond to @xmath42 for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the values so computed for these data sets are given in table 7 .",
    "note that the errors are generally asymmetric , but usually not strongly so .",
    "it should be noted that formally these observed - frame measurements need to be corrected for time dilation by division by @xmath43 , where the systemic redshift of ngc  4151 is @xmath44 .      to obtain the black hole mass",
    ", we also need to measure the width of each emission line .",
    "indeed , we wish to measure the line - of - sight velocity distribution for the _ variable _ part of the emission - line , specifically avoiding contaminating non - variable ( on reverberation timescales ) components , such as a contribution from the much larger narrow - line region .",
    "we use all of the spectra obtained during the observing campaign to construct a mean spectrum and a root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum ; the rms spectrum isolates the variable part of the emission lines . in figs .  3 and 4",
    ", we show the mean and rms spectra for the swp and lwp images from 1988 and 1991 , respectively .    to measure the emission - line widths , we first interpolate the rms continuum under the emission lines by fitting a linear continuum in the continuum windows given in table 1 .",
    "we then characterize the line width in two ways , by its full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and by the second moment of the line profile , i.e. , the line dispersion @xmath45 , as described by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . to evaluate the uncertainties in these measurements",
    ", we follow the procedure described by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using a procedure similar in spirit to that used to evaluate uncertainties in the time delays . for a sample of @xmath31 spectra , we select @xmath31 spectra at random , in each case without regard to whether or not a particular spectrum has been previously selected .",
    "these @xmath31 random spectra are used to construct mean and rms spectra , and both line width measurements are made for each emission line .",
    "this constitutes one monte carlo realization .",
    "a large number of similar realizations yields a mean and standard deviation for each line - width measure .",
    "line width measurements and associated uncertainties for each of the emission lines are given in table 8 .",
    "the emission - line widths here have been converted to the rest - frame of ngc  4151 and have been adjusted as described by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to account for the resolution of the _ iue _ spectrograph .",
    "we note that we prefer @xmath46 over fwhm as a line width measure for a variety of reasons , including that it is generally more repeatable in noisy spectra ( which rms spectra often are ) .",
    "two obvious difficulties are apparent upon inspection of figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "the first of these is that the core of the emission line is strongly self - absorbed .",
    "this is very apparent in the rms spectra , and is especially strong in the 1991 data .",
    "it is impossible to correct for this absorption since we do not know the intrinsic unabsorbed profile .",
    "however , we can try to assess the severity of the systematic uncertainty by modeling the intrinsic profile in a variety of ways to see how much the line width measurement might change .",
    "we experimented with various means of accounting for the effects of the absorption , and the largest change in line width was obtained by fitting the unabsorbed wings of the emission line with a gaussian .",
    "the gaussian so constructed had a value of @xmath45 that was about 10% smaller than that obtained in our direct measurement , and the value of fwhm , which is more sensitive to the flux at line center , decreased by more than 20% .",
    "we can regard our measurement of the line width as an upper limit that is probably not a terrible overestimate of the true unabsorbed value of @xmath45 . in any case",
    ", the effect on the black hole mass estimate is quite insignificant given the level of accuracy that we can currently achieve in black hole mass measurement .",
    "we also note that the line is self - absorbed , but the absorption is much weaker and the emission line in the rms spectrum is too noisy for the absorption feature to be apparent .",
    "a second difficulty is that the and emission lines are strongly blended in their wings .",
    "since these can not be uniquely deblended , we make the approximation that the both lines are approximately symmetric about line center and use the unblended half of each line ( the short wavelength side for and the long wavelength side for ) to determine the width .",
    "these are the values of the line widths that appear in table 8 .",
    "as noted earlier and as observed in other sources , we expect that if the dynamics of the blr are dominated by the gravitational force of the central black hole , we should see a virial relationship between emission - line widths and time lags of the form @xmath47 . to test this for ngc  4151 , we plot the emission - line line widths from the rms spectra ( table 8) versus the measured time delays ( table 7 ) in fig .  5 .",
    "we supplement the uv data with measurements of the h@xmath24 and h@xmath12 line widths and lags from peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , based on data originally published by maoz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "there is considerable scatter in fig .  5 , but with the exception of the h@xmath24 and h@xmath12 measurements based on the kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) monitoring program , the scatter is similar to that seen in other sources ( cf .",
    "peterson et al . 2004 ) . the range of lags in this diagram is less than a factor of 3 , whereas in the similar plot for ngc  5548 ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 of peterson et al.2004 )",
    ", the range of lags is nearly a factor of 15 .",
    "moreover , given the limited quality of the monitoring data on ngc  4151 , it is perhaps surprising that the results are as good as they appear to be . neither of the two uv monitoring data sets on ngc  4151 are remarkably good : the 1988 _ iue _ data are slightly undersampled and the duration of the 1991 experiment was somewhat short , especially in the case of the observations , the effect of which is apparent in its flat - topped ccf ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the only uv line not affected by self - absorption or blending is ] , for which the variations are comparatively weak .",
    "the two existing optical data sets are even more problematic . in the case of the 1988 data from maoz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , the emission - line lags appear to be well determined , but it is difficult to measure reliably the width of the broad - line component in these spectra . in ngc 4151 ,",
    "the narrow - line components are much stronger relative to the broad - line components than they are in most type 1 agns .",
    "the spectra from this campaign are rather low resolution , so the [ ] lines are partially blended with one another . moreover , the line - spread function appears to vary among the spectra , possibly as a result of drift in the large aperture that was used to ensure an accurate flux calibration .",
    "the combination of these factors makes it hard to isolate the broad - line component and determine their widths with great confidence .",
    "nevertheless , the h@xmath24 and h@xmath12 lags and line widths as plotted in fig",
    ".  5 are reasonably consistent with the virial relationship derived from the uv lines in this object .    on the other hand , the optical data described by kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) present some serious difficulties for a virial interpretation .",
    "however , in this particular case , the nature of the variations during this campaign were not favorable for reverberation analysis  both the continuum and emission lines showed nearly monotonically increasing flux throughout the monitoring period , and the amplitude of variation was relatively low . without a strong change in the sign of the first derivative of the light curves , as seen in the light curves in figs .  1 and 2",
    ", it is difficult to obtain a highly reliable reverberation lag . in an attempt to mitigate the unfavorable effects of a monotonic rise",
    ", we experimented with removing the long - term trend in these data prior to cross - correlating the time series ( i.e. , `` detrending '' the data , cf .",
    "welsh 1999 ) , and this had the effect of moving the already - small lag even closer to zero .",
    "our suspicion is that this lag measurement is spurious .",
    "it seems likely that at such a low level of variability , there are correlated errors between the continuum and emission - line measurements , which manifest themselves as a correlated signal at zero lag .",
    "we have not been able to demonstrate this conclusively and thus need to keep in mind the possibility that these measurements represent an actual deviation from the virial relationship .",
    "however , given the unfavorable nature of the observed variations , we are more inclined at the present time to simply disregard this particular data set .    the best - fit slope to all of the data points in fig .",
    "5 is @xmath48 , which differs from the virial slope of @xmath49 by only @xmath50 .",
    "obviously additional , better data will be required to determine whether or not the virial relationship between lag and line widths holds in the case of ngc  4151 .    setting aside this difficulty",
    ", we nevertheless proceed with an estimate of the mass of the central black hole by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) with the scaling factor @xmath51 , as determined by onken et al.(2004 ) by normalizing the agn @xmath13@xmath14 to that for quiescent galaxies .",
    "we use @xmath36 for the time delay and @xmath45 to characterize the line width .",
    "if we use all of the data in fig .  5 , we find a black hole mass @xmath52 , based on a weighted average of the individual mass estimates for each line .",
    "if we restrict the mass estimate to the uv data points from the present work , we obtain a mass estimate of @xmath53 .",
    "our preferred estimate is obtained by eliminating the most problematic data , leaving only ] , , and from the two uv campaigns .",
    "the resulting mass estimate is @xmath54 .",
    "we remind the reader , however , that due to unquantified systematic uncertainties ( as embodied in the scale factor @xmath10 in eq .  1 ) , this is probably uncertain by a factor of 34 ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ) , as are all reverberation - based mass estimates .",
    "in this contribution , we have examined archival _ iue _",
    "spectra that have been reprocessed with the newsips software . for two separate monitoring programs ,",
    "we were able to obtain emission - line time delays for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ] @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , the lags span a very narrow range , even when optical balmer line measurements from ground - based campaigns are included , precluding a strong test of the expected virial relationship , @xmath47 .",
    "clearly additional data are required to clarify the situation .    ignoring this difficulty for the time being , we obtain an estimate of the mass of the central black hole by combining our time delay measurements with line - width measurements .",
    "based on the subset of lines that we regard as most reliable , we provide an estimate of the black hole mass of @xmath54 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath55 higher than the previous estimate of @xmath56 from peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; the earlier estimate was based on the optical data from kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which are somewhat problematic .",
    "indeed , problems with the existing optical data have led us to carry out a new optical reverberation program , the results of which will be reported elsewhere ( bentz et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the higher mass estimate means that the black hole radius of influence , @xmath57 , is larger than previously supposed , projecting to an angular radius of @xmath58 .",
    "this makes ngc  4151 one of the best candidates for black hole measurement by other direct means that depend on high angular resolution .",
