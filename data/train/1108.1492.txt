    "flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) involving decays of charm mesons have played a leading role in flavor physics as well as in search for new physics@xcite .",
    "these processes involve neutral meson oscillations , radiative decays and leptonic and semileptonic(lepton flavor and number conserving ) decays .",
    "lepton flavor and number violating ( lfv ) processes are also important in this regard and have been explored for signs of new physics .",
    "they are allowed in  the sm through higher order diagrams similar to fcnc but assuming oscillation in the virtual neutrino loop .",
    "these diagrams are doubly cabibbo suppressed , furthermore lfv are not allowed in sm .",
    "therefore such processes provide the golden charmed physics beyond the sm .",
    "neutral meson oscillations like @xmath6 mixing and coherent double - flavor oscillations is an exciting new way to search for cp - violation in the charm sector@xcite .",
    "radiative decays of charm mesons have been studied upto one loop order@xcite .",
    "processes involving @xmath7 meson have proven to be an excellent laboratory for studying qcd since charm meson masses , o(2 gev ) , are placed in the middle of the region of non - perturbative hadronic physics@xcite .",
