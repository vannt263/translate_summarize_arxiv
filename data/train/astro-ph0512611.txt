    "they go on to suggest that the milky way is not typical for a normal spiral galaxy of its luminosity .",
    "as discussed below , if this result holds then our models provide a straightforward interpretation : that the milky way has experienced fewer than average major accretion events with lmc - size objects . indeed , phase space information could test ideas of this kind specifically by revealing few major accretion events and many more lower - mass accretions .",

    "we extend our models to include chemical evolution with the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "these include enrichment from both type ii and type ia supernovae and feedback provided by supernovae blow - out and winds from intermediate mass stars .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of each satellite galaxy accreted onto the main galaxy and trace the build - up of a series of metals , such as fe or @xmath5-elements . each star particle in the simulations",
    "has assigned a set of [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]abundance ratios determined by the star formation history of the satellite in which the star originated .",
    "the coupled n - body simulations resolve each milky way - type stellar halo with a few million particles and allow us to explore the phase - space distribution of chemical abundances in unprecedented detail .",
    "tidal streams in the halo display various degrees of spatial coherence , given their different times of accretion and orbital properties .",
    "similarly , we expect to see various degrees of coherence in the chemical abundance space , given the different star formation and chemical enrichment histories of their progenitor satellites .    figure [ fig : metal_map_halos_feh_afe ] shows the present day ( @xmath12 ) spatial distribution of [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]abundance ratios for halos h1 @xmath7 h8 .",

    "each pixel represents a color coded chemical abundance , calculated as the average [ fe / h]or [ @xmath5/fe]of all stars included in a volume @xmath16  kpc@xmath17 our models show that inner regions of the halos ( @xmath18  kpc ) are consistently more homogeneous than the outer ones , both in terms of the spatial distribution of stars and in the overall chemical abundances .",
    "this is because the inner halo builds up rapidly , with most of its stellar mass already in place in the first @xmath19  gyr of the galaxy evolution @xcite , and at these times the dynamical timescales were shorter and phase - mixing more efficient .",
    "the spatial distribution of the stars has been discussed in more detail by @xcite , who also note a similar behavior in the surface brightness and velocity distribution of halo stars . here",
    "we concentrate on the corresponding [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]distributions .",
    "we find that the inner @xmath20  kpc regions are , on average , metal enriched ( [ fe / h]@xmath21 ) and we trace this to the metal contribution of a few massive ( @xmath22 ) satellites accreted early on and which contribute a significant fraction ( @xmath23 ) to the total stellar mass of the halo @xcite",
    ". the rapid growth of these satellites at early times fueled an intense star formation and therefore at the time of accretion the satellites were already enriched in [ fe / h ] . in the outer regions ( @xmath24  kpc ) the streams are more spatially separated and their various chemical enrichments are more distinct .",
    "both metal poor and metal rich streams are present , with the more metal poor ones originating in satellites with low star formation rates ( these are typically low mass satellites ) . a more detailed discussion of radial distributions of stars will be given in ",
    "[ sec : radial ] .",
    "figure [ fig : metal_halo_averages ] shows the average [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]for all our milky way - type halos .",
    "the general trend in our simulations is that the more massive a stellar halo , the more chemically evolved it is , i.e. the higher [ fe / h]and lower [ @xmath5/fe]it has ( these relations are independent of the cutoff radius assumed for @xmath25 ) .",
    "the [ fe / h]@xmath26 trend in figure [ fig : metal_halo_averages ] is consistent with having the same slope as that of the well - known relation between metallicity and luminosity seen in low - mass galaxies , [ fe / h]@xmath27 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we note that our chemical feedback model is normalized such that surviving satellites at @xmath28 match the observed metallicity - luminosity relation for local group galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is interesting however that a similar relation propagates to the stellar halos themselves .",
    "this follows from the fact that the slope of the relation for satellite galaxies is governed by their parent halo potential well depths .",
    "therefore disrupted satellites also follow a [ fe / h]@xmath27 relation ( see figure 4 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but with a lower [ fe / h]normalization because these systems tend to be accreted earlier and are less evolved @xcite .",
    "the same relation propagates to a _ stellar halo _ mass - metallicity relation because stellar halo mass correlates strongly with the number of disrupted _ massive _ satellites ( see  [ sec : mah ] ) .",
    "the more massive disruptions a stellar halo contains , the more metal rich the stellar halo becomes .",
    "similarly , because its progenitors are massive , they are more metal rich , and the halo is higher metallicity as a result .",
    "our results suggest that the hierarchical assembly is an important factor in determining the metallicity - mass relation for stellar halos . a similar argument can be extended to qualitatively understand the observed trend presented by @xcite , who show that low luminosity spiral galaxies have more metal poor central stellar halos than do high luminosity spirals .",
    "this qualitative trend can be explained in a hierarchical scenario : low - luminosity spirals tend to have accretion histories dominated by correspondingly lower - luminosity dwarfs .",
    "lower luminosity dwarfs are more metal poor and thus produce lower metallicity stellar halos . while one can derive the [ fe / h]@xmath29 relation based on simple scaling arguments that relate the metal loss to the depth of the central galaxy s dark mater halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this does not necessarily imply that the relation forms in situ .",
    "we caution that for a complete understanding of the origin of the relation ( both of its shape and normalization ) , one needs a more accurate treatment of gas physics processes in satellites after they are accreted onto the main halo .",
    "these effects are not currently included in our models , but we expect them to be of second order to the hierarchical mass assembly",
    ".      we can verify the hierarchical origin of the [ fe / h]@xmath29 relation by investigating the mass accretion histories of the stellar halos . given that in a typical mass accretion history",
    "the few massive satellites contribute significantly to the final stellar mass , we expect the overall halo metallicity ( and hence the [ fe / h]@xmath29 trend ) to be determined mainly by these massive accretions .",
    "the time of accretion of massive satellites is also a related factor @xmath7 satellites accreted later are likely to be more metal rich .",
    "figure [ fig : metal_halo_averages_taccr ] plots for each stellar halo in our sample the lookback time of accretion of the most massive progenitors , specifically an average over those satellites which contribute more than 10@xmath30 to the total stellar fraction .",
    "the general tendency is that more massive halos assemble more recently .",
    "additionally , for halos of the same mass the spread in [ fe / h]can be also explained by differences in their formation time ( e.g. the three halo models with @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore a protracted assembly of the higher mass stellar halos seems to be at the origin of the [ fe / h]@xmath29 relation ( see also similar results of * ? ? ?",
    "_ a test case : milky way and m31 _    we further illustrate the relation between mass accretion histories and the overall metallicities with the case of milky way and m31 .",
    "these are two large galaxies with roughly the same luminosity , but the milky way halo is more metal poor than that of m31 , perhaps by as much as 1  dex . the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) in the milky way halo peaks around [ fe / h]@xmath32 @xcite , whereas the mdfs measured at several locations in the _ inner _ `` halo '' of m31 peak at values between [ fe / h]@xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "although , as discussed below , the outer halo of m31 at [ fe / h]@xmath35 may be a more realistic estimate of the true underlying stellar halo component of this galaxy @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mah_halos_08_09 ] shows the mass accretion patterns , expressed as the fractional contribution of accreted satellites to the total stellar mass of the inner halo , for two halo models similar to inner milky way and m31 : halo h5 , with @xmath36[fe / h]@xmath37@xmath38 and halo h4 , with @xmath36[fe / h]@xmath37@xmath39 ( these are also the most extreme cases in our sample ) .",
    "the more metal poor halo has one major accretion of stellar mass , @xmath40 accreted about 11  gyr ago , while the more metal rich one has two major accretions , both of masses @xmath41 and accreted about 8.5  gyr ago .",
    "thus the most massive , metal rich halo had an assembly history which includes more massive progenitors and which were accreted later .",
    "the inference from these results is that the difference in metallicities between the two galaxies can be explained if m31 experienced one or two more massive accretions than the milky way and/or a protracted merger history .",
    "however we note that the metallicity measurements in both milky way and m31 are not yet completely reliable .",
    "one reason is that most observations probe only the inner few tens of kpc and therefore may not be representative of the entire halos or may include additional galactic components .",
    "for example , recent observations in m31 extending further out into the halo find [ fe / h]@xmath42 for stars beyond 60  kpc , suggesting that the high metallicities measured in the inner regions include the contribution from m31 s extended bulge ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * gilbert et  al .",
    ", in prep ; ) .",
    "additional contamination may come from the recently discovered disk - like component extending out to @xmath43  kpc @xcite .",
    "there are also differences in the measurement methods . in the milky way metallicities",
    "are determined spectroscopically , while in m31 they are mostly determined photometrically ( but see new spectroscopic measurements of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore unclear whether the metallicity discrepancies between the two galaxies are real , but ongoing wide - field spectral studies in these galaxies may be soon able to answer this problem .",
    "nevertheless , our results are more general and suggest ways in which massive accretion events can increase the average metallicities of halos ( eg . 1 massive dwarf galaxy , @xmath44 , accretion is sufficient to increase the average metallicity of a milky way - type halo by about 0.5  dex ) .",
    "as explained in the introduction , metallicity gradients are a powerful tool for constraining the timescale of formation of galaxies .",
    "an often - cited hypothesis is that hierarchical formation will result in a negligible metallicity gradient . in detail , however , some variations may occur , particularly in regions which continue to assemble until recent times .    the radial distributions of [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]abundances for all simulated halos are shown figures [ fig : metal_gradient_1 ] and [ fig : metal_gradient_2 ]",
    ". the distributions do not show significant global gradients , but many do show variations over scales of a few tens of kpc .    the lack of large - scale gradients can be explained by examining the mass accretion patterns of our simulated halos .",
    "the bulk of the stellar halos forms early , both in the inner and outer regions .",
    "the outer halos continue to accumulate stellar debris up to more recent times ( @xmath45  gyr ago ) , but this represents only a small fraction of the total stellar mass @xcite . therefore",
    ", even if the later assembly of the outer halo favors an influx of chemically enriched material , this is not sufficient to create significant large - scale gradients .",
    "moreover , the chemical abundances are directly correlated with the ages of the stars , rather than with the time of accretion .",
    "figure [ fig : metal_time_gradient ] plots the distribution of lookback accretion times ( left panels ) and the ages of stellar populations ( right panels ) versus the radial distance , for all halo models .",
    "as this figure shows , even if the stellar material is accreted recently , it usually contains a mixture of both young and old stars that dilutes the metallicity differences .",
    "many of our halos do show distinct small - scale abundance gradients .",
    "for example , in halos h5 , h6 and h9 the average [ fe / h]increases with @xmath46 in the inner 100  kpc ( similarly , [ @xmath5/fe]decreases over the same distance ) . the gradients in these halos arise from the spatial distribution of their stellar populations .",
    "figure [ fig : metal_time_gradient ] shows that the inner regions of these three halos contain mostly old ( @xmath47  gyr ) stellar populations , whereas the outer regions have on average stellar populations a few gyr younger .",
    "this result has implications for searches for the lowest metallicity stars in the stellar halo and complimentary attempts to use the metallicity distribution function to constrain the nature of reionization and popiii star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , the lowest metallicity stars are expected to inhabit the most central regions of the galaxy ( note the inner - most radial bin in figure [ fig : metal_gradient_2 ] ) .",
    "thus general attempts to use observed metallicity distribution functions to constrain early chemical enrichment must take special care to account for spatial biases in observational samples of stars .",
    "the radial distributions of accretion times , ages and chemical abundances give an insight into the composition of stellar populations in the simulated halos .",
    "our results suggest that stellar halos of galaxies like the milky way should contain a large fraction of old ( @xmath48  gyr ) stellar populations which were accreted in the first few gyr of the mass assembly .",
    "in addition to the underlying population of old stars , some halos contain small fractions of intermediate age ( @xmath49  gyr ) populations .",
    "irrespective of their age , stars can be either metal poor or metal rich , depending of the mass and star formation rate of their progenitor satellite .",
    "interestingly , in terms of its age and metallicity distributions , the milky way halo lies at the edge of our sample simulated halos .",
    "the stars in the milky way halo are mostly old and metal poor , whereas in our models a significant number of old stars are already metal enriched .",
    "( note however that the typical observations cover only the inner @xmath50  kpc of the halo and in this range some of our halos are old and metal poor ) .",
    "our results seem to suggest that the milky way halo is an atypical case in the range of galaxies of similar mass .",
    "the metallicity constraints rule out an accretion of a massive ( @xmath51 ) halo progenitor at early times when the bulk of the halo formed .",
    "we also note that recent observations show that many other bright spiral galaxies of similar mass have more metal rich halos than that of the milky way .",

    "= 6.truein      tidal streams are fossil records of past accretions and therefore can be used to reconstruct the merger histories of galaxies .",
    "their detection however is difficult due to their low surface brightness and to the loss in spatial coherence the longer they orbit in the galaxy .",
    "the identification of stellar streams can be improved by extending the parametric space to include new dimensions like the kinematic parameters and chemical abundances .",
    "if kinematic data is available from observations , one can use the @xmath52 space to identify stellar streams .",
    "this parametric space is particularly useful for epochs of slow evolution , when the time required for stars to exchange energy and angular momentum is long compared with the age of the galaxy , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be approximated as invariants of motion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", the tidal debris from different accretions is expected to clump in distinct locations in this space .",
    "numerical simulations of satellite accretions in a fixed potential confirm that this is indeed the case @xcite .",

    "the clumps in the low @xmath53 and @xmath55 regime are more difficult to separate , in part because of their superposition , but also because this is also the regime of rapid growth of the galaxy when the energy and angular momentum of stars change significantly .",

    "the plateau is maintained by the enrichment in @xmath5-elements in type ii supernovae operating on short timescales ( of a few myr ) and the [ @xmath5/fe]decrease is driven by the later enrichment in fe produced in type ia supernovae . prolonged episodes of star formation will tend to decrease the [ @xmath5/fe]ratios of stars in a satellite .",

    "most of the stars with [ @xmath5/fe]@xmath62 are in the high energy and angular momentum regime , associated with recent accretions .",

    "more specifically , the @xcite simulations produce milky way - type halos as metal poor as @xmath36[fe / h]@xmath37@xmath72 .",
    "we suspect that the difference arises from the fact that @xcite allow stellar halo stars to originate via in situ star formation in their simulations , while our stellar halos form entirely from accreted dwarfs .",
    "thus the metallicity spread in observed halos may provide an interesting avenue for testing the idea of accreted vs. in situ stellar halo formation .",
    "the small spread in stellar halo metallicities seen by @xcite may favor an accretion - dominated model , although the evidence is weak as of now .",
    "a second difference may arise from the cosmological conditions in @xcite , which are set via a semi - cosmological top - hat sphere with standard cdm fluctuations , while ours rely on extended press schechter within an @xmath0cdm framework .",
    "it is interesting to note that our restriction on accretion histories to be those without recent major mergers would ( if anything ) bias our distributions to more metal poor halos  just the opposite bias that would be required to match reconcile our results with those of @xcite .",
    "our models predict that tidal streams from massive satellites should stand out in stellar overdensities and be more metal rich .",
    "the available observational evidence seems to support our finding .",
    "a wide survey of the inner m31 halo reveals an increase in metallicity in fields associated with the giant stellar stream @xcite .",
    "numerical modeling of the stream finds that the progenitor satellite was indeed massive , @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities in color magnitude diagrams are also seen in the m31 halo and are believed to be associated with satellite accretions @xcite .",
    "while metallicity inhomogeneities are commonly detected , the observational evidence regarding radial gradients is so far inconclusive .",
    "studies of globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or of the low metallicity stars in the galaxy @xcite do not show obvious gradients in [ fe / h ] . however , some studies report a decline of [ @xmath5/fe]ratios of halo stars with radial distance in the galaxy @xcite . in m31 ,",
    "measurements in several fields extending up to @xmath74  kpc in the halo are consistent with a small , less than 1  dex , [ fe / h]radial gradient @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that metallicity gradients of less than 1  dex over distances of a few tens of kpc are consistent with the hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "however , for a more accurate comparison between our models and observations , we have to take into account the methods of measurement used in observations .",
    "for example , in external galaxies radial distances can not be currently determined .",
    "what observations generally measure are the separations from the centers of galaxies , which are projected radii on the plane of the sky",
    ". moreover , current observations probe small fields in the stellar halos at different projected radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we illustrate this with a mock observation of one of our halos ( h1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : metal_cyl_gradient ] shows the [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]distributions versus the projected radius @xmath75 on the plane @xmath76 .",
    "the large symbols are averages in cylindrical shells , while the small symbols show the decomposition of these values at equidistant azimuthal angles in each cylindrical shell .",
    "thus each small symbol approximates a projected field of observation a few kpc on the size , similar to the size of observational fields .",
    "figure [ fig : metal_cyl_gradient ] demonstrates that a large spread in either [ fe / h]or [ @xmath5/fe]may exist at a given @xmath75 and therefore a random sampling with small fields over different projected radii can result in a detection of spurious abundance gradients .",
    "our results therefore caution that a wider spatial sampling of halos is necessary in order to confirm the current detections of abundance gradients .",
    "the motivation of this work was to provide predictions of the hierarchical formation paradigm that can be tested with the data from current and upcoming astrometric and spectroscopic observations . in this study",
    "we have explored the global properties as the phase - space distribution of the [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]chemical abundances in a series of milky way - type stellar halos formed in a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    - for a fixed dark matter halo mass , we predict that stellar halo metallicities increase with stellar halo mass .",
    "the resultant [ fe / h]@xmath29 relation for stellar halos arises because high - mass stellar halos tend to have accreted a larger number of massive satellite progenitors .",
    "the relation propagates hierarchically because massive progenitors are more metal rich than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "- chemical abundance distributions provide important links to the minor merger histories of galaxies .",
    "for example , the observed metallicity differences between the ( metal poor ) milky way and ( metal rich ) m31 stellar halos may arise because m31 destroyed one or two more massive satellites than the milky way .",
    "- in agreement with observations , we find that all simulated halos contain an underlying population of old metal poor stars .",
    "more massive halos contain additional intermediate age populations accreted more recently .",
    "- in contrast with the milky way , some of our halo models contain old stellar populations which are metal rich , originating in massive satellites ( @xmath77 ) accreted early on .",
    "the metallicity constraints seems to suggest that the milky way has an atypical mass accretion history , lacking in massive early accretion events , compared with other galaxies of a similar mass .",
    "- we predict metallicity gradients in [ fe / h]and [ @xmath5/fe]in our _ hierarchically - formed _ stellar halos that are often non - negligible .",
    "gradients extend typically over a few tens of kpc and may be as large as @xmath78  dex in [ fe / h]and @xmath79  dex in [ @xmath5/fe ] .",
    "- we predict that most metal poor stars in the galactic halo are buried within the central @xmath6kpc of the galaxy .",
    "this will likely be important for efforts to use the observed count of low metallicity stars to constrain models of cosmic reionization and the transition from pop iii to pop ii star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "- we suggested a method to identify cold tidal streams in stellar halos by selecting stars with [ @xmath5/fe]@xmath80 , which trace streams from recently accreted satellites .",
    "if used to complement the common kinematical identification methods , the proposed selection criterion may improve the detection of tidal streams .",
    "combining kinematic and chemical abundance information proves to be a powerful tool for understanding how galaxies form and evolve . in anticipation to the wealth of data to be delivered by current and future galactic surveys , it is important to develop and improve on numerical simulations of the chemical evolution of the galaxy in a realistic cosmological context @xmath7 such as those presented in our study @xmath7 and to devise criteria to identify more tidal streams .",
    "while our methods successfully reproduce the gross chemical abundance properties of the galactic halo and satellite dwarf galaxies , our treatments of dissipational physics including star formation , gas cooling , and energetic feedback mechanisms may be too simplistic to recover the detailed properties of the modeled systems with high accuracy . for instance",
    ", the assumed truncation of star formation in dwarf systems after they accrete into their host galaxy is very approximate .",
    "gravitational torques applied by the central galaxy and other satellite systems may induce episodes of efficient star formation in the dwarfs we model , especially near pericentric passage .",
    "such bursts occurred in the lmc and smc , as inferred from their stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and should be modeled if more accurate chemical enrichment histories for dwarf systems are to be achieved .",
    "these complications speak to the need for high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of the galactic stellar halo and dwarf satellite population . while recent hydrodynamical simulations have begun to address this issue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they have not yet matched the mass resolution necessary to capture the entire population of dwarfs galaxies we follow in our collisionless simulations nor the full complexity of our chemical enrichment model .",
    "we acknowledge the importance of the previous work and look forward to increasingly sophisticated hydrodynamical simulations of the cosmological formation of the galactic stellar halo .",
