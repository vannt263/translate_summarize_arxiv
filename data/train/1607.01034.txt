    "in this paper we consider convex geometric graphs , i.e. , graphs whose vertices are points in convex position in the plane , and whose edges are segments connecting pairs of vertices .",

    "all graphs we consider throughout the paper are subgraphs of @xmath0 , and thus , we slightly abuse notation identifying a graph with its set of edges .    a _ simple perfect matching _ ( spm ) in @xmath0 is a set of @xmath4 pairwise disjoint edges ( i.e. , edges that do not meet , not even in an interior point ) .",

    "a natural turn - type question is : what is the maximal possible number of edges in a geometric graph on @xmath1 vertices that does not contain any element of @xmath6 ?",
    "this question was extensively studied with respect to various families @xmath6 , e.g. , all sets of @xmath7 disjoint edges  @xcite and all sets of @xmath7 pairwise crossing edges  ( @xcite , and see also  @xcite ) .    an equivalent way to state the question is to consider sets that `` block '' all elements of @xmath6 :    a set of edges in a geometric graph @xmath0 is called a blocking set for @xmath6 if it intersects ( i.e. , contains an edge of ) every element of @xmath6 .",
    "a _ blocker _ for @xmath6 is a blocking set of smallest possible size .",
    "the family of blockers for @xmath6 is denoted @xmath8 .    using this formulation ,",
    "the above question is equivalent to the question :    [ q1 ] what is the size of the blockers for @xmath6 ?    in various cases , including the two cases mentioned above , the answer to question  [ q1 ] is known , and then , the natural desire is to provide a _ characterization _ of the blockers for @xmath6 .    in  @xcite we provided a complete characterization of the blockers for the family @xmath9 of spms of @xmath0 .",
    "the characterization involves the notion of a _ caterpillar tree _  @xcite .",
    "a tree @xmath10 is a caterpillar if the derived graph @xmath11 ( i.e. , the graph obtained from @xmath10 by removing all leaves and their incident edges ) is a path ( or is empty ) .",
    "a geometric caterpillar is simple if it does not contain a pair of crossing edges . a longest ( simple ) path in a caterpillar @xmath10",
    "is called a spine of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the set of vertices of @xmath0 ( viewed as the vertex set of a convex polygon @xmath13 in the plane ) , labelled cyclically from @xmath14 to @xmath5 .",
    "any blocker for @xmath9 is a simple caterpillar tree whose spine lies on the boundary of the polygon and is of length @xmath15 .",
    "if the spine `` starts '' with the vertex @xmath14 and the edge @xmath16 $ ] , then the edges of the blocker are : @xmath17:1 \\leq i \\leq t\\ } \\cup \\{[t+j-1-\\epsilon_{t+j},t+j+\\epsilon_{t+j}]:1 \\leq j \\leq m - t\\},\\ ] ] where the @xmath18 are natural numbers satisfying @xmath19 .",
    "conversely , any set of @xmath4 edges of the described form is a blocker for @xmath9 .",
    "[ thm : spms ]    the geometric interpretation of   is as follows . if the polygon @xmath13 is regular ( which can be assumed w.l.o.g . ) , then the direction of each consecutive edge of the blocker , as listed above , is obtained from the direction of the preceding edge by rotation by @xmath20 radians . in the first @xmath21 edges , the `` back '' endpoint of each edge is the `` front '' endpoint of the previous edge .",
    "starting with the @xmath22-st edge , the `` back '' endpoint goes `` back '' ( as reflected by subtraction of the corresponding @xmath18 ) , and the length of the edge changes accordingly .",
    "an example of a blocker for @xmath9 is presented in figure  [ fig : t1 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : spms ] uses only elementary tools , but is rather complex , spanning about 15 pages .    in this paper",
    "we provide a complete characterization of the blockers for the family @xmath23 of all simple hamiltonioan paths ( shps ) . as in any shp ,",
    "the odd - labelled edges form an spm , it is clear that any blocking set for @xmath9 is also a blocking set for @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to show that both the blockers for @xmath9 and the blockers for @xmath23 are of size @xmath4 ( see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",
    "hence , we clearly have @xmath24 .",
    "we show that these two families of blockers are actually equal .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be the complete convex geometric graph on @xmath1 vertices . denote by @xmath25 and @xmath26 the families of blockers for the families @xmath9 of simple perfect matchings and @xmath23 of simple hamiltonian paths in @xmath0 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath27 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] is rather short , and in particular , it yields a short proof for theorem  [ thm : spms ]  much shorter than the proof presented in  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of blockers for shps in a complete convex geometric graph of odd order @xmath28 is more complicated , and will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "we view the vertices of @xmath0 as the vertices of a convex polygon @xmath13 of order @xmath1 .",
    "we label them , in order , by the numbers @xmath29 .",
    "we regard the labels as elements of the cyclic group @xmath30 , and define the _ direction _ of the edge @xmath31 $ ] to be @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , we denote by @xmath34 the set of all edges in direction @xmath7 .",
    "two edges of the same direction are called _",

    "let @xmath45 be a blocker for @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath4 edges of @xmath45 belong to at most @xmath4 directions ( out of the @xmath1 possible directions ) . since the union of any two consecutive directions ( i.e. , @xmath46 or @xmath42 ) is an shp , @xmath45 can not miss two consecutive directions .",
    "this leaves only two choices : either exactly one edge in each odd direction @xmath47 , or exactly one edge in each even direction @xmath40 .",
    "the second choice leaves all boundary edges @xmath48,[2i,2i+1]$ ] untouched , and these form a simple hamiltonian circuit .",

    "we also know that @xmath45 can not contain two opposite boundary edges , as they belong to the same direction",
    ". our first step will be to show that the boundary edges of @xmath45 form a single ( consecutive ) path .",

    "let @xmath89 . by proposition  [ prop1 ]",
    ", we may assume that the boundary edges of the convex hull of @xmath13 in @xmath45 form a path @xmath90 of length @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "as @xmath45 contains exactly one edge in each odd direction ( by observation  [ obs1 ] ) , we know that @xmath45 contains @xmath93 further edges in directions @xmath94 .",
    "all these edges are proper diagonals of @xmath13 .",
    "we show several properties of these edges , which will imply that @xmath45 satisfies the conditions of theorem  [ thm : spms ] .    1 .",
    "none of the extra edges connects two vertices of the boundary path @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , any edge of odd order that connects two vertices of that path is parallel to an edge of that path , and we know that @xmath45 can not contain two edges of the same direction .",
    "2 .   suppose one of the extra edges connects two vertices that are not on the boundary path @xmath90 , or connects an endpoint of that boundary path with a vertex outside the path . to be specific , assume this edge is @xmath95 $ ] , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in this case , we construct a specific shp @xmath98 that avoids @xmath45 , yielding a contradiction .",
    "to construct @xmath98 , we concatenate the boundary path @xmath99 ( of length @xmath100 ) with the zig - zag path @xmath101 ( of length @xmath102 ) , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the boundary path @xmath99 clearly avoids @xmath45 .",

    "we have thus shown that the @xmath93 extra ( i.e. , non - boundary ) edges of @xmath45 , of directions @xmath132 , must connect interior vertices of the boundary path @xmath90 with interior vertices of the complementary path @xmath133 .",
