    "the disk contains a relatively small fraction of the total mass and angular momentum , so it is less clear that spin equilibrium can be achieved .",

    "then decoupling occurs at @xmath240 when the disk surface density is @xmath241 and the radiative cooling time , at least , is still @xmath242 .",
    "the disk reaches this radius at @xmath243hrs , when about one third of the original disk has accreted . in our scenario ,",
    "the resulting decoupled vapor cools and provides the raw material for formation of the moon .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the early evolution of a remnant disk formed by a giant impact with earth .",
    "we estimated that a vapor disk has large rosseland mean optical depth .",
    "cooling is ineffective , even if the disk is convective .",
    "any form of turbulent angular momentum transport , characterized by shakura - sunyaev parameter @xmath12 , will heat it on a timescale @xmath244 , which is short compared to the thin disk evolution timescale @xmath245 .    we showed , following @xcite , that if the disk contains a vapor component with @xmath246 then that component is well coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "the precise lower limit for coupling depends on composition , particularly the abundance of k and na . once the critical temperature is exceeded  and this may happen during initial collision  then there is the possibility of mhd turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the evolution of a magnetically coupled disk depends on the initial field strength and geometry .",
    "if mhd turbulence is present , the numerical evidence suggests that it will heat the disk still further and transport angular momentum efficiently .",
    "assuming that angular momentum _ is _ transported efficiently , we have put forward a scenario in which the disk first heats to the virial temperature and then spreads on a timescale of @xmath247 hrs .",
    "the outcome is a ring of material at the outer edge of the disk that spreads and cools until it decouples from the magnetic field . using a simple model",
    ", we estimate that the decoupled remnant disk has radius @xmath248 .",
    "we estimated that the disk mass @xmath249 , and that by the time the disk decouples @xmath250 of the original disk mass is left .",
    "a large fraction of the protolunar disk s power is dissipated in the boundary layer where the disk meets earth s surface .",
    "the boundary layer will produce high entropy material , and we have speculated that this material might mix back into the disk , or become unbound and leave in the form of a powerful , possibly magnetized wind originating from the earth or from the disk itself @xcite . any wind from the disk is likely enhanced in volatiles : inefficient heat transport from the disk interior implies that the disk surface temperature can not be sustained above the grain condensation temperature , so the disk will outgas as condensation and settling are driven by radiative cooling at the surface .",
    "two uncertainties hang over our scenario .",
    "first , what is the distribution of temperatures in the post - impact disk ?",
    "most numerical simulations of the collision generate some hot material in the disk , with the final temperature distribution dependent on initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , even if the inital disk is cool , any angular momentum diffusion in the post - collision disk will heat the disk , and the inefficiency of heat transport guarantees that the disk will heat before it spreads , reaching @xmath117 .",
    "second , what is the initial field strength ?",
    "if the field is weak enough then resistive diffusion damps the magnetorotational instability , and ( if @xmath190 ) differential rotation will provide only a modest , linear - in - time field amplification .",
    "the post - impact temperature distribution depends on details of the impact dynamics .",
    "simulations of merging magnetized neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also a merger of degenerate objects  exhibit fields that are amplified by at least a factor of @xmath251 in turbulence driven by shear discontinuities formed in the collision . in @xcite",
    "the amplification increases with resolution , with no sign of convergence .",
    "it is reasonable to think that the field will saturate when magnetic energy is comparable to turbulent kinetic energy , and requires only a few shear times , a time comparable to the duration of the collision . in sum , it is plausible that magnetic coupling alters the dynamics of the collision itself , the subsequent circularization of the disk , and the initial thermal state of the disk .    the magnetic field strength and geometry of the pre - impact earth and impactor will likely never be known .",
    "still , one can ask how weak a field is required to initiate runaway heating of the disk .",
    "the boundary layer may be particularly constraining because @xmath252 per nucleon is dissipated in the layer , suggesting that the boundary layer will immediately generate hot , well - coupled vapor even if coupling is initially poor elsewhere in the disk .",
    "turbulence associated with the boundary layer might then provide a large amplification factor for the initial field and mix it outward into the disk .",
    "our work follows the recent interesting paper by @xcite ( hereafter cdt ) , who demonstrate that the protolunar disk is likely to be magnetically coupled ( @xcite also suggested that the protolunar disk might be well coupled , but they do not provide a detailed evaluation of the ionization fraction or instability conditions ) .",
    "cdt also consider mixing in the protolunar disk .",
    "we have performed a less careful evaluation of the ionization fraction , but cdt s work suggests that ionization is , in any event , dominated by na and k. while cdt use an unstratified shearing box model to estimate a lower limit on the angular momentum transport efficiency due to mhd turbulence of @xmath253 , these zero - net - flux , unstratified , shearing boxes are known to be nonconvergent @xcite .",
    "simulations of stratified shearing box models , global models , and models with explicit dissipation tend to produce @xmath254few@xmath255 .",
    "the weight of numerical evidence therefore suggests much higher @xmath12 and more rapid evolution of a magnetized protolunar disk .",
    "interestingly , stratified shearing box models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that @xmath12 depends on distance from the midplane , with @xmath256 at @xmath257 .",
    "if this obtains for a near - virial protolunar disk , and the ratio of turbulent angular momentum diffusion to turbulent mixing is of order unity @xcite , then mixing would occur on a small multiple of the _ dynamical _ timescale .",
    "the same efficient mixing might also transport magnetic fields outward from the boundary layer into the bulk of the disk .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter cm ) recently considered several scenarios for the long - term evolution of the protolunar disk with the aid of a numerical model .",
    "cm s models typically have a hot disk near the inner edge , close to the boundary layer , with @xmath258k , consistent with magnetic coupling . following @xcite and others ,",
    "cm assume that the disk cools from the surface with a photospheric effective temperature @xmath259k .",
    "cm do not solve self - consistently for the temperature of the disk photosphere , although this is exceedingly difficult because a cool surface would consist of a mixture of vapor , liquids , and solids .",
    "as in cm , viscous heating and cooling do not balance in our scenario .",
    "our scenario is unorthodox in that it assumes a hot initial disk , with the cold disk forming later at of order ten earth radii . in the canonical picture the moon forms just outside the roche radius .",
    "the early evolution of the moon s orbit is very poorly constrained , however .",
    "certainly the tidal coupling of earth and moon is too poorly known for this to constrain the initial semimajor axis of the moon @xcite .",
    "cfg s work was supported in part by a romano professorial scholar appointment , a simons fellowship in theoretical physics , and a visiting fellowship at all souls college , oxford .",
    "we thanks s. desch , c. thompson , m. chandra , b. ryan , j. papaloizou , and c. terquem for comments , and the referee , s. charnoz , for a thoughtful report that greatly improved the manuscript ."
