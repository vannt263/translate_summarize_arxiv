    "self - assembly has been considered for over @xmath1 years to be central to understanding structure formation in living systems @xcite . as a consequence , an increasing interest has been devoted to enhance our understanding of the theoretical basis of the fundamental mechanisms governing self - assembly and the observables required to characterize the interactions driving thermodynamic self - assembly transitions @xcite . despite these studies , the knowledge of how this process works is still incomplete and many of the basic principles characterizing this type of organization are unclear .",
    "it is obvious that a complete analysis of the self - assembly phenomenon is a quite difficult subject because of the complexity of the involved microscopic mechanisms .",
    "for this reason , the understanding of simple models with increasing complexity might be a help and a guide to establish a general framework for the study of this kind of systems , and to stimulate the development of more sophisticated models which can be able to reproduce concrete experimental situations .    in this line of work",
    ", two previous articles @xcite , referred to as papers i and ii , respectively , were devoted to the study of a system of self - assembled rigid rods adsorbed on a two - dimensional lattice . in paper",
    "i , tavares et al . studied a system composed of monomers with two attractive ( sticky ) poles that polymerize reversibly into polydisperse chains and , at the same time , undergo an isotropic - nematic ( in ) continuous phase transition .",
    "so , the interplay between the self - assembly process and the nematic ordering is a distinctive characteristic of these systems . using an approach in the spirit of the zwanzig model @xcite",
    ", the authors found that nematic ordering enhances bonding .",
    "in addition , the average rod length was described quantitatively in both phases , while the location of the ordering transition , which was found to be continuous , was predicted semiquantitatively by the theory . with respect to the characteristics of the phase transition , tavares et al . assumed as working hypothesis that the nature of the in transition remains unchanged with respect to the case of monodisperse rigid rods on square lattices , where the transition is in the 2d ising universality class @xcite .",
    "paper ii was a step further , analyzing the universality class of the in phase transition at intermediate density .",
    "for this purpose , an extensive work of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis was carried out .",
    "the obtained results showed that the self - assembly process affects the nature of the transition .",
    "thus , the accurate determination of the critical exponents indicated that , for a square lattice , the universality class of the in transition changes from 2d ising - type for monodisperse rods without self - assembly @xcite to @xmath0 potts - type for self - assembled rods .    in this context , the objectives of the present paper are ( 1 ) to extend the previous work to triangular and honeycomb lattices using the same techniques developed in paper ii ; and ( 2 ) to study the effect of the lattice structure on the critical behavior of self - assembled rigid rods .",
    "for this purpose , mc simulations @xcite supplemented by analysis using fss theory @xcite have been carried out to study the critical behavior in a system of self - assembled rigid rods deposited on triangular and honeycomb lattices . as in paper ii",
    ", the calculations were developed at constant temperature and different densities , being @xmath2 the normalized scaling variable , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent density and critical density , respectively .",
    "the accurate determination of the critical exponents , along with the behavior of binder cumulants , confirmed that the in transition of self - assembled rigid rods on triangular and honeycomb lattices at intermediate density belongs to the @xmath0 potts universality class .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the lattice - gas model and the simulation scheme . in sec .",
    "iii we present the mc results and the general conclusions .",
    "( a ) ( c ) ( b ) ( d )",
    "as in papers i and ii , we consider a system of self - assembled rods with a discrete number of orientations in two dimensions . in this case , the surface is represented as an array of @xmath5 adsorption sites in a triangular or in a honeycomb lattice arrangement and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath6 particles are adsorbed on the substrate with three possible orientations along the principal axis of the lattice .",
    "these particles interact with nearest - neighbors ( nn ) through anisotropic attractive interactions .",
    "thus , a cluster or uninterrupted sequence of bonded particles is a self - assembled linear rod .    under these considerations ,",
    "the adsorbed phase is characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 indicates a sum over nn sites ; @xmath9 means integer division ; @xmath10 represents the nn lateral interaction between two neighboring @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are aligned with each other and with the intermolecular vector @xmath13 ; and @xmath14 is the occupation vector with @xmath15 if the site @xmath11 is empty , @xmath16 if the site @xmath11 is occupied by a particle with orientation along the @xmath17-axis , @xmath18 if the site @xmath11 is occupied by a particle with orientation along the @xmath19-axis , and @xmath20 if the site @xmath11 is occupied by a particle with orientation along the @xmath21-axis .    at fixed temperature ,",
    "the average rod length increases as the density increases and the polydisperse rods will undergo an nematic ordering transition @xcite . in order to follow the formation of the nematic phase , we use the order parameter defined in previous work @xcite , which in this case can be written as @xmath22 where each vector @xmath23 is associated to one of the @xmath24 possible orientations ( or directions ) for a chain on the lattice .",
    "in addition , @xmath25 the @xmath26 s lie in the same plane ( or are co - planar ) and point radially outward from a given point @xmath27 which is defined as coordinate origin ; @xmath28 the angle between two consecutive vectors , @xmath26 and @xmath29 , is equal to @xmath30 ; and @xmath31 the magnitude of @xmath26 is equal to the number of @xmath32-mers aligned along the @xmath11-direction [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . note that the @xmath26 s have the same directions as the @xmath33 vectors in ref .",
    "[ ] . these directions are not coincident with the allowed directions for the chains on the real lattice .",
    "the concept of linear rod is trivial for triangular lattices [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . however , in a honeycomb lattice , the geometry does not allow for the existence of a linear array of monomers . in this case , we call  linear rod \" to a chain of adjacent monomers that can be assembled in only three types of sequences , defining three directions in similar way to the triangular lattice [ see fig .",
    "1(c ) ] . two  types \" of sites can be recognized in the honeycomb lattice : @xmath34 ( grey ) and @xmath35 ( black ) .",
    "monomers ( colored according to the adsorption site ) can be placed on these sites in three different orientations : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( for the @xmath34-sites ) ; and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( for the @xmath35-sites ) as shown in fig .",

    "the figure also shows an unassociated @xmath35-monomer ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the problem has been studied by canonical monte carlo simulations using an vacancy - particle - exchange kawasaki dynamics @xcite and metropolis acceptance probability @xcite .",
    "typically , the equilibrium state can be well reproduced after discarding the first @xmath48 monte carlo steps mcs .",
    "then , the next @xmath49 mcs are used to compute averages .",
    "all calculations were carried out using the parallel cluster baco located at instituto de fsica aplicada , universidad nacional de san luis - conicet , san luis , argentina .",
    "this facility consists of 60 personal computers each with a 3.0 ghz pentium-4 processor and 90 personal computers each with a 2.4 ghz core 2 quad processor .    in our monte carlo simulations",
    ", we set the temperature @xmath50 , varied the density @xmath51 and monitored the order parameter @xmath52 , which can be calculated as simple average .",

    "in addition , in order to discuss the nature of the phase transition , the fourth - order energy cumulant @xmath58 was obtained as @xmath59",
    "as discussed in section i , the phase diagram of a system of self - assembled rigid rods on square lattices has been recently reported by tavares et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the critical density , at which the in transition occurs , increases monotonically as @xmath60 is increased .",
    "thus , the nematic phase is stable at low temperatures and high densities [ see fig .",

    "the calculations were developed at @xmath61 and different densities .    in the present study ,",
    "we set the lateral interaction to @xmath62 [ a close value to that used in ref . [ ] ] , thus allowing a direct comparison with previous results for square lattices .",
    "accordingly , the density was varied around half coverage . for each value of @xmath3",
    ", the effect of finite size was investigated by examining lattices with @xmath63 ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",

    "curves in part ( a ) [ ( b ) ] correspond to triangular [ honeycomb ] lattices .",

    "however , at the critical point the cumulants adopt a nontrivial value @xmath68 ; irrespective of system sizes in the scaling limit .",
