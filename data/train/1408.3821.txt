    "however , the existence of _ universal computers _ that can efficiently simulate ( almost ) all other computing devices  analog or digital  was only articulated in the 1930s by church and turing ( turing excluded quantum physics when considering universality ) @xcite . efficiency was studied from a theoretical perspective at first , but strong demand in military applications in the 1940s lead turing and von neumann to develop detailed hardware architectures for universal computers  turing s design ( pilot ace ) was more efficient , but von neumann s was easier to program .",

    "universal computers based on field - programmable gate - arrays ( fpgas ) and general - purpose graphics processing units ( gpgpus ) outperform cpus in some cases , but their efficiencies remain complementary to those of cpus . the success of deterministic general - purpose computing manifests in the convergence of diverse functionalities in portable inexpensive smartphones . after steady improvement , general - purpose computing displaced entire industries ( newspapers , photography , etc ) and launched new applications ( video conferencing , gps navigation , online shopping , networked entertainment , etc ) @xcite .",
    "application - specific integrated circuits ( asics ) streamline input - output and networking , or optimize functionalities previously performed by general - purpose hardware .",
    "they speed up biomolecular simulation 100-fold @xcite and improve the efficiency of video decoding 500-fold @xcite , but require design effort with keen understanding of specific computations , impose high costs and financial risks , need markets where general - purpose computers lag behind , and often can not adapt to new algorithms .",

    "* limits as aids to evaluating emerging technologies . * without sufficient history , we can not extrapolate _ scaling laws _ for emerging technologies , yet expectations run high . for example , new proposals for analog processors appear frequently ( as illustrated by adiabatic quantum computers ) , but fail to address concerns about analog computing , such as its limitations on scale , reliability , and long - running error - free computation .",
    "general - purpose computers meet these requirements with digital integrated circuits ( ic ) and now command the electronics market . in comparison , quantum computers  both digital and analog  hold promise _ only in niche applications _ and do not offer _ faster general - purpose computing _ as they are no faster for _ sorting _ and other specific tasks @xcite .",

    "the scaling of commercial computing hardware regularly runs into formidable obstacles @xcite , but near - term technological advances often circumvent them .",
    "the international technology roadmap for semiconductors ( itrs ) @xcite keeps track of such obstacles and possible solutions with a focus on frequently - revised consensus estimates .",
    "for example , consensus estimates initially predicted 10 ghz cpus for the 45 nm technology node @xcite , versus the 3 - 4 ghz range seen in practice . in 2004 , the unrelated quantum information science and technology roadmap @xcite forecast 50 physical qubits by 2012 .",

    "in addition to moore s law , dennard scaling , as well as amdahl s and gustafson s laws reviewed earlier , metcalfe s law @xcite states that the value of a computer network , such as the internet or facebook , scales as the number of user - to - user connections that can be formed .",
    "grosch s law @xcite ties @xmath19-fold improvements in computer performance to @xmath36-fold cost increases ( in equivalent units ) .",
    "applying it in reverse , we can estimate acceptable performance of cheaper computers .",
    "but such laws only capture _ ongoing scaling _ and will break down in the future .    the _ roadmapping process _ represented by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors ( itrs )",
    "@xcite relies on consensus estimates and works around engineering obstacles .",
    "it tracks improvements in materials and tools , collects best practices and outlines promising design strategies . as suggested in @xcite , it can be enriched by analysis of limits .",
    "we additionally focus on how closely such limits can be approached . aside from historical `` wrong turns '' recalled in sections [ sec : eng ] and [ sec : energy ] , we find interesting effects when examining the tightness of individual limits . while energy - time limits are most critical in computer design @xcite , space - time limits appear tighter @xcite and capture bottlenecks formed by interconnect and communication .",
    "they suggest optimizing gate locations and sizes , and placing gates in three dimensions .",
    "one can also adapt algorithms to spatial embeddings @xcite and seek space - time limits .",
    "but the gap between current technologies and energy - time limits hints at greater rewards . _ charge recovery _",
    "@xcite , _ power management _",
    "@xcite , voltage scaling @xcite , and _ near - threshold computing _",
    "@xcite reduce energy waste .",
    "optimizing algorithms and circuits simultaneously for energy and spatial embedding @xcite gives biological systems an edge ( from the 1d worm _ c. elegans _ with 302 neurons to the 3d human brain with 86 billion neurons ) @xcite .",
    "yet , using mass - energy to compute can be a veritable _ nuclear option_. in a 1959 talk , which predated moore s law , richard feynman suggested that there was `` plenty of room at the bottom , '' forecasting the miniaturization of electronics . today",
    ", with relatively little physical room left , _ there is plenty of _ energy _ at the bottom_. if this energy is tapped for computing , how can resulting heat be removed ? recycling heat into mass or electricity seems ruled out by limits to energy conversion and the acceptable thermal envelope .",
    "technology - specific limits for modern computers tend to express tradeoffs , especially for systems with conflicting performance parameters and properties @xcite .",
    "little is known about limits on _",
    "design technologies_. given that large - scale complex systems are often designed and implemented hierarchically @xcite with multiple levels of abstraction , it would be valuable to capture losses incurred at abstraction boundaries and between levels of design hierarchies .",
    "it is common to estimate resources required for a subsystem and then implement the subsystem to satisfy resource budgets .",
    "underestimation is avoided because it leads to failures , but overestimation results in overdesign .",
    "inaccuracies in estimation and physical modeling also lead to losses during optimization , especially in the presence of uncertainty .",
    "clarifying engineering limits gives hope to circumvent them .",
    "technology - agnostic limits look simple and have had significant impact in practice , for example aaronson explains why np - hardness is unlikely to be circumvented by through physics @xcite .",
    "limits to _ parallel computation _ became prominent after cpu speed levelled off ten years ago .",
    "they suggest using faster interconnect @xcite , local computation that reduces communication @xcite , time - division multiplexing of logic @xcite , architectural and algorithmic techniques @xcite , solving larger problem instances , and altering applications to embrace parallelism @xcite .",
    "john gustafson advocates a _ natural selection _ : the survival of applications fittest for parallelism . in another twist ,",
    "the performance and power consumption of industry - scale distributed systems is often described by probability distributions , rather than single numbers @xcite , making it harder to even formulate appropriate limits .",
    "we also can not yet formulate fundamental limits related to the complexity of the software - development effort , the efficiency of cpu caches @xcite , and computational requirements of incremental functional verification , but we have noticed that many known limits are either loose or can be circumvented , leading to _",
    "secondary limits_. to wit , the @xmath37 limit is worded in terms of worst - case rather than average - case performance , and has not been proven despite heavy evidence .",
    "researchers have ruled out entire categories of proof techniques as insufficient to complete such a proof @xcite . while esoteric , such _ tertiary limits _ can be effective in practice",
    " in august 2010 , they helped researchers quickly invalidate vinay deolalikar s highly - technical attempt at proving @xmath37 . on the other hand , the correctness of lengthy proofs for some key results could not be established with acceptable level of certainty by reviewers , prompting efforts in verifying mathematics by computation @xcite . in summary",
    ", we have reviewed what is known about limits to computation , including existential challenges arising in the sciences , design and optimization challenges arising in engineering , as well as current state of the art .",
    "these categories are closely linked due to the rapid pace of technology development . when a specific limit is approached and obstructs progress , understanding its assumptions is a key to circumventing it .",
    "some limits are hopelessly loose and can be ignored , while other limits remain conjectured based on empirical evidence and may be very difficult to establish rigorously .",
    "such _ limits on limits to computation _ deserve further study .",
