    "fractional exclusion statistics ( fes ) , introduced by haldane in ref . @xcite and with the thermodynamic properties calculated mainly by isakov @xcite and wu @xcite , has received very much attention since its discovery and has been applied to many models of interacting systems ( see for example refs .",
    "several authors have also discussed the microscopic reason for the manifestation of fes @xcite .",
    "iguchi and sutherland @xcite showed that liquids of particles in three dimensions , interacting through long - range forces exchibit the nature of quantum liquids with fes , the characteristics of the fes being determined by the interaction .",
    "murthy and shankar @xcite analysed a system of fermions in the colagero - sutherland model .",
    "the system has a constant density of states ( dos ) ( along the single particle energy axis ) and has a total energy of @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the population of the single particle state of energy @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( for any @xmath4 ) is the dos , @xmath5 is the mean - field interaction potential , and @xmath6 is the total number of particles in the system . by redistributing in an uneven way the interaction energy between the particles of the system and associating to the level",
    "@xmath7 the quasi - particle energy @xmath8 murthy and shankar obtained a gas with fes of parameter @xmath9 .    a model which is similar to that of murthy and shankar @xcite has been employed also in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe anyons on the lowest landau level , coupled chiral particles on a circle , or interacting bosons in two - dimensions .    in refs .",
    "@xcite i showed that the same model , with a slight generalization , can lead to a condensation , which is a first order phase transition .    in this paper",
    "i will extend the method of murthy and shankar to systems of general dos and any interaction potential , @xmath10 ( where @xmath7 and @xmath11 label the single particle states ) and i will show that such systems lead to a more general manifestation of fes .",
    "while in the murthy and shankar model we have only _ direct _ exclusion statistics ( i.e. the exclusion statistics is manifested only in the subspace where the particles are inserted ) of constant parameter , @xmath12 , here , in the general case , we shall have also _ mutual _ statistics ( acting from one subspace into another ) ; therefore we shall have more complex parameters , denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "i will calculate explicitely the parameters @xmath13 and i will prove that the mutual parameters ( @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ) are proportional to the dimension of the hilbert subspace on which they act , verifying in this way the conjecture put forward in ref . @xcite .",
    "let us generalize the model of murthy and shankar @xcite by writing the total energy as @xmath15 and the quasiparticle energies as @xmath16 ( see figure [ msbasic ] ) . to make the calculations and the physical implications as clear as possible",
    ", we assume that we have bosons in the systems  in this way we shall not have to worry about adding a unit to the direct exclusion statistics parameters .",
    "i will also assume that the system is large enough , so that the spectrum is ( quasi)continuous , of the ( generally not constant ) dos , @xmath17 .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath10 depends only on the energies of the interacting particles , in eq .",
    "( [ epstilgen ] ) i drop the subscript @xmath7 and i use @xmath18 as a variable , to write @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ epstilgenint ] ) i also ingnored the term @xmath20 .",
    "although this term , for @xmath21 , may cause a first order phase transition @xcite , here i just want to emphasize the characteristics of the emerging fes and carring along this term in the calculations would be useless .",
    "i assume also that the function @xmath22 is bijective , so that i can use freely its inverse , @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend also on the populations of the energy levels below @xmath18 or below @xmath24 , respectively , i shall use also the notations @xmath25 and @xmath26 whenever this will be needed for clarity .",
    "if i denote the density of states along the @xmath24 axis by @xmath27 and the number of particles between the energy levels @xmath28 and @xmath29 , by @xmath30 , then we have the relation @xmath31where , obviously , @xmath32 $ ] .    to show the underlying fes character of the system , i use the coarse - graining of the energy axis @xmath24 .",
    "i split the quasiparticle energy axis into intervals@xmath33 ,   \\ldots,[\\tilde\\epsilon_{m-1},\\tilde\\epsilon_m ] , \\ldots$]which are small , but still contain large enough numbers of particles and energy levels ; the fes will be manifested between and within these intervals @xcite .",
    "to each @xmath34 it corresponds an @xmath35 .",
    "i rewrite eq .",
    "( [ epstilgenint ] ) as a summation , @xmath36 where , based on the fact that the intervals @xmath37 $ ] are small and @xmath5 is assumed to be continuous in both variables , i used the approximation @xmath38 for any @xmath39 . using this decomposition",
    "i calculate the fes parameters .",
    "first i calculate the _ direct _ exclusion statistics parameter by adding @xmath40 particles in the interval @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "since i hold fix @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then @xmath44 and all the energy levels below it will also remain fix , while @xmath45 and all the energy levels above it will change .",
    "i calculate the change of single particle states in the interval @xmath41 $ ] ( see figure [ insertion ] , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) ; i use the notation @xmath48 , which is the value taken by @xmath49 after the insertion of the @xmath40 particles .",
    "the initial number of states in the interval @xmath41 $ ] is @xmath50 and after the addition of particles it changes into @xmath51 .",
    "so , to calculate the difference @xmath52 , i calculate first the change of @xmath53 : @xmath54 if i denote @xmath55 and i expand @xmath56 around @xmath45 , i get from ( [ tildeeps_sum_interv ] ) and ( [ tildeeps_sum_interv_intro ] ) an equation for @xmath57 : @xmath58 or , changing the summation into an integral , @xmath59 i look for linear effects , therefore i ignore the term proportional to @xmath40 from the denominator of equation ( [ eq.delta_eps_int ] ) and i replace @xmath60 by @xmath61 ( assuming that @xmath5 is continuous in both variables ) .",
    "writing @xmath62 , i get the _ direct _ exclusion statistics parameter @xmath63}{1 + \\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{\\partial v[\\epsilon,\\epsilon ' ] } { \\partial\\epsilon}\\sigma(\\epsilon')n(\\epsilon')\\,d\\epsilon ' } .",
    "\\label{alpha_eps_eps}\\ ] ] note that @xmath64 is identical to @xmath12 calculated before @xcite if @xmath65/\\partial\\epsilon\\equiv0 $ ] .",
    "now let s calculate the _ mutual _ exclusion statistics parameters .",
    "for this i introduce @xmath66 particles in the interval @xmath67 $ ] ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this will change all the energy levels @xmath69 , of @xmath70 ( see figure [ insertion ] ) ; let s denote the new values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , by @xmath71 .",
    "taking all these into account , i write @xmath72 n(\\tilde\\epsilon_j,\\tilde\\epsilon_{j+1 } )   + \\sum_{j = i+1}^{m-1 } v[\\epsilon',\\epsilon'_{j } ] n(\\tilde\\epsilon_j,\\tilde\\epsilon_{j+1 } ) .",
    "\\label{tildeeps_sum_interv_ip}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding again @xmath73 to the linear order in both variables , i get the equation for @xmath74 : @xmath75 where i used the superscript to indicate that the particles were inserted at @xmath34 .",
    "the unknown quantities , @xmath76 , can be calculated recursively , starting from @xmath77 , using first equation ( [ eq.delta_eps_int ] ) and then equation ( [ eq.delta_eps_i ] ) . by doing so",
    ", we first notice that @xmath78 _ is proportional to _ @xmath66 , for any @xmath11 . transforming both summations of equation ( [ eq.delta_eps_i ] ) into integrals and introducing the notation @xmath79",
    "i get the final equation for @xmath57 , @xmath80 if we plug in equation ( [ fepsepsp_def ] ) into equation ( [ int_eq_delta_eps ] ) , the later becomes an integral equation for @xmath81 .",
    "having now the expression for @xmath82 , we can calculate the change of the number of states in the interval @xmath41 $ ] : @xmath83 where we ignored @xmath84 , since @xmath85 is itself a small quantity .",
    "notice that because both , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , vary at the insertion of particles at energies lower than @xmath44 , the variation of the number of quasiparticle states in the interval @xmath41 $ ] is proportional to @xmath86 , i.e. is proportional to the dimension of the interval . plugging equation ( [ int_eq_delta_eps ] ) into equation ( [ dim_var_i ] ) i obtain the _ mutual _ exclusion statistics parameter , @xmath87_{\\epsilon(\\tilde\\epsilon)}\\ ] ] one can see immediately that if @xmath88 for any @xmath18 , as it was in the case of constant density spectrum , @xmath89 for any @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "now we observe directly the surprising character of the mutual exclusion statistics , namely that it is proportional to the energy interval on which it acts , @xmath91 . in ref .",
    "@xcite i showed that this characteristics is necessary to ensure the self - consistency of the fes formalism , especially in the thermodynamic limit . the method to calculate the particle population for such exclusion statistics parameters",
    "is also given there .",
    "fractional exclusion statistics ( fes ) is usually considered as an `` exotic '' type of statistics , manifested in special types of systems .",
    "contrary to this belief in this paper , by analysing a system with a very general model of interaction between the constituent particles , i showed that fes is rather the rule than the exception .",
    "fes is manifested in general in interacting systems .",
    "moreover , i calculated the fes parameters of the model gas and i showed that the _ mutual _ exclusion statistics parameters are proportional to the subspace on which they act .",
    "this conclusion is also in contradiction with the usual definition of fes and therefore seems peculiar .",
    "but it is not so . in ref .",
    "@xcite i showed that the typical definition of the mutual exclusion parameters leads to inconsistencies in the thermodynamics calculations and , in order to eliminate these inconsistencies , the exclusion parameters must have exactly the properties deduced here .",
