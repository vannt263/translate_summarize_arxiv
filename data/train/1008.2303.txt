    "coarse - graining procedures provide a general way to represent mesoscopic aggregates of several architectures ( e.g. , linear and hyperbranched polymers , micelles , microgels , etc . ) as particles interacting via an effective , isotropic potential @xmath3 .",

    "a remarkable feature of the cluster fcc crystals is that upon increasing the density the lattice constant approaches a constant value @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the wave vector at which @xmath14 takes its absolute minimum .",
    "an obvious consequence of the density - independent value of @xmath15 is that the population of each lattice site scales proportionally with density .",
    "these properties are rather different from usual crystallization features in colloidal systems .",

    "the specific systems to be simulated were determined and thus the parameters defining the mixture ( relative particle size , mixture compositions , temperature and density , self- and cross - interactions ) were chosen in such a way as to avoid the region of demixing in the phase diagram . because of the high total densities to be considered , the former parameters were also selected with the goal of reducing computational expense .",

    "given the large amplitude of the long - time anticorrelations , reaching values of @xmath147 at the minimum , it is improbable that the oscillation around @xmath148 is an statistical artifact .",
    "the figure also includes coherent data , at its respective rlvs , of the pure gem-8 system at @xmath143 and @xmath149 .",
    "the rather different behavior in the pure system and in the mixture , even with only a 5% of @xmath19-particles in the latter , becomes evident .",
    "while full relaxation followed by oscillation is observed in the mixture , no decay is present in the pure cluster crystal .",
    "it must be stressed that this difference is not related to a much slower intrinsic dynamics of the pure system for the selected state point @xmath143 and @xmath149 .",
    "indeed , by inspection of all the other dynamic observables introduced above , including coherent functions _ for non - rlvs _ , it is found that the pure system shows a faster dynamics than the mixture at the former state points .",
    "for example @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively for the mixture and the pure system .",
    "therefore , the oscillatory feature observed at long times in the mixture is induced by the addition of the gaussian @xmath19-particles .",
    "the presence of negative correlations in the collective dynamics of @xmath20-particles at near rlv - wavevectors , reached at typical times @xmath152 , is a particular feature of the mixture , which is is absent for the pure @xmath20 system within the simulated time window .",
    "physically , it describes a process by which a positive density correlation at @xmath153 at a distance of the order of the lattice constant turns negative at time scales @xmath154 . as such",
    ", it points to the existence of some characteristic oscillation frequency @xmath155 , which corresponds to wavevectors lying at the edge of the brillouin zone , i.e. , a short - wavelength acoustical mode .",
    "although such a process has not been seen for the pure @xmath20-system , phonon excitations exist for the pure system as well ; it is thus reasonable to assume that the corresponding frequency for the pure system is much smaller that @xmath156 , so that the time required for this relaxation process to be seen in the coherent scattering intensities is much longer . a detailed calculation of the phonon spectra of the mixture at hand , along parallel lines to the one recently carried out for pure systems @xcite would shed light into this question , it is however cumbersome and it will be left as the subject of a future publication .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the fact that the @xmath19-particles provide additional repulsions to the @xmath20-species and thus enhance the restoring forces that act on the latter , it appears plausible that in the mixture the phonon frequencies are larger than those in the pure system and thus the characteristic time @xmath154 becomes visible within the simulation window .",
    "alternatively , the issue could also be resolved by performing very long simulations for the pure @xmath20-system .",
    "the dynamic aspects of binary mixtures of ultrasoft ( gem-8 and gaussian ) particles have been studied by means of md .",
    "the present work extends previous results for the cluster crystal phase of the pure gem-8 system , and investigates the effects of the addition of the non - clustering gaussian particles on the corresponding dynamic scenario .",
    "the obtained results show that as the total density increases at fixed composition , the gem-8 species builds cluster crystals with a relatively high localization . as in the one - component system ,",
    "the incoherent scattering functions indicate a localization transition for self - motions of the gem-8 particles , which is avoided by incessant hopping motion between clusters .",
    "this transition seems to occur at lower densities than for out - of - lattice collective correlations , confirming in the mixture the dynamic decoupling observed in the one - component cluster crystal .",
    "on the other hand , the gaussian particles remain delocalized in the periodic potential induced by the gem-8 clusters and display fast self - motions .",
    "however , slow collective dynamics is observed for specific wave vectors , namely those belonging to the reciprocal lattice .",
    "this feature reflects the preferential motion of the gaussian particles over the interstitials , confirming the expectations from static correlations .",
    "a striking feature is revealed by the analysis of collective correlations of the gem-8 particles , for wave vectors at the reciprocal lattice , a feature which we attribute to the stiffening of an acoustical mode at the edge of the brillouin zone , caused by the presence of the @xmath19-particles . an additional open question that should be",
    "the subject of future investigations is the influence of the _ type _ of elementary processes employed to model the dynamics in the mixture , along the lines of the work by coslovich _",
    "_  carried out for pure systems @xcite . here",
    ", it should be examined which of the features discovered by means of our md approach survive if one employs monte carlo moves instead , which are expected to mimic better the overdamped , brownian dynamics of the system .    finally , while there is evidence that both classes of ultrasoft potentials accurately model the interactions between real macromolecules in dilute systems , the validity of these potentials in dense systems has yet to be verified .",
    "the results presented in this paper add to a growing body of work which suggests that , the search for dense systems where ultrasoft potentials remain valid is a worthwhile pursuit .",
