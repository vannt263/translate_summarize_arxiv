    "the nature of the metallic state of a dilute two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in high - mobility silicon mosfets , first observed by kravchenko",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite nearly a decade ago , has still not been established .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed to explain the new conducting state , ranging from superconducting , to non - fermi liquid , to percolation , to classical ( see refs . for overviews and references to the original literature ) .",
    "the unique character of this state is reflected by its thermodynamic signatures of both negative pressure and compressibility @xcite .    although recognized as a theoretical possibility for quite some time  at least in three dimensions @xcite , an electron gas with a uniform neutralizing background",
    "was expected to be unstable at negative compressibility , and the model meaningless .",
    "later theoretical @xcite and also numerical @xcite studies nevertheless considered both the region with positive and negative compressibility without encountering conceptual difficulties .",
    "eisenstein , pfeiffer , and west @xcite more recently concluded that the global features of their 2deg compressibility data to very low densities , where the system appears to undergo a quantum phase transition to an insulating state @xcite , could be explained simply using the hartree - fock approximation , which consists of including the exchange contribution to the ground - state energy of a free fermion gas .",
    "their analysis does not account for impurities , which are of paramount importance at and beyond the metal - insulating ( mi ) transition .",
    "ilani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reached similar conclusions based on their compressibility data of a dilute two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) . by placing several single electron transistors directly above the 2dhg , they could in addition determine possible spatial variations in the system .",
    "they concluded that the metallic state at negative compressibility is homogeneous in space and well described by the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "as the system crosses to the insulating state and the hartree - fock approximation ceases to be applicable , they found the system to become spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "they interpreted this observation as supporting scenarios in which the mi transition is described as a percolation process @xcite    using density functional theory in the local density approximation , shi and xie @xcite recently investigated the spatial distribution of the electron number density of a 2deg in the presence of impurities . as usual , impurities were included by coupling the particle number density to a fluctuating potential with a random distribution .",
    "the parameter characterizing the gaussian distribution , which we will refer to as the impurity strength , determines the roughness of the impurity landscape .",
    "their numerical study incorporates the monte carlo data on the ground - state energy of a clean system by tanatar and ceperly @xcite . for given impurity strength",
    ", the study shows that at some average density @xmath0 islands of very low densities form in a metallic sea of high densities . at higher average densities ,",
    "the sea level is high enough to fill all of the valleys of the impurity landscape , and the system is homogeneous . with decreasing @xmath0 , the sea level drops and the insulating islands grow . at a critical value ,",
    "the islands percolate the system , which at this percolation threshold becomes insulating .",
    "the sea level now dropped to the extent that the electrons are confined to the valleys of the impurity landscape .",
    "according to this picture , the transition to the insulating state takes place at lower densities for cleaner systems .",
    "this is in accord with experiments , where the lowest critical density , @xmath1 , was observed in an exceptionally clean 2dhs @xcite .",
    "shi and xie @xcite also studied the importance of the coulomb interaction by comparing with the case where this interaction is turned off .",
    "they found that at an average density where the interacting system was still metallic , the free electron gas , which is insulating , had formed a few isolated lakes of high density at valleys of the impurity landscape .",
    "in this paper , we postulate on the nature of the ground state of electron gases at negative compressibility . in doing so",
    ", we ignore impurities , as justified by the experimental findings that this metallic state is homogeneous in space and that the compressibility data is already well described by the hartree - fock approximation of a clean electron gas .",
    "the study emphasizes the three - dimensional electron gas ( 3deg ) as much more information from theoretical studies is available than for the 2deg .",
    "most of the 3d conclusions , however , also apply to the 2d case discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2deg ] .",
    "the following two sections focus on the changes brought about when going from positive to negative compressibility .",
    "one of the most surprising changes is that a test particle acquires a screening cloud in its immediate vicinity which overcompensates the test charge , so that the coulomb interaction becomes _ attractive _ for like charges .",
    "the changes are also discussed from the perspective of fermi liquid theory , describing the electron gas after the screening mechanism has taken effect and resulted in only short - range interactions .",
    "the main result of this paper is contained in sec .",
    "[ sec : cdw ] , where it is argued that the ground state of an electron gas at negative compressibility is a charge density wave ( cdw ) , although exponentially damped .",
    "the phenomena considered here are by no means specific to an electron gas , but also appear in a charged bose gas as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bose ] .",
    "a 3deg is characterized by the screening of charges .",
    "when a test particle of charge @xmath2 is placed at the origin , @xmath3 , the system responds by rearranging its charge distribution to screen the external charge .",
    "the charge density @xmath4 thus induced , @xmath5 { \\rm e}^{{\\rm i } { \\bf q } \\cdot { \\bf x}},\\ ] ] is determined by the dielectric function @xmath6 at zero frequency , which encodes the static screening effects of the 3deg .",
    "the total induced charge @xmath7 cancels the charge of the test particle since the screening factor @xmath8 vanishes at zero wavevector @xmath9 .",
    "the test charge is therefore always perfectly screened .",
    "however , the induced charge density differs in how it is distributed , depending on the electron number density @xmath0 , or , equivalently , the ratio @xmath10 of the average interparticle distance @xmath11 to the bohr radius @xmath12 .",
    "( for valence electrons in 3d metals , @xmath13 , characterizing the strength of the coulomb interaction , ranges from @xcite @xmath14 to @xmath15 . )    at weak coupling ( @xmath16 ) , corresponding to high electron number densities , a screening cloud of opposite charge surrounds the test charge , and the screened coulomb potential decreases exponentially with increasing distance . on its tail ,",
    "far away from the test charge , the potential has superimposed a small oscillatory modulation of wavevector @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the fermi wavevector .",
    "these friedel oscillations , leading to a periodic change in sign of the coulomb potential , originate from a singularity in the dielectric function at @xmath17 , where electron - hole excitations start to develop an energy gap @xcite .",
    "a 3deg s response to a test charge fundamentally changes at larger values of the coupling constant @xmath13 because of a qualitative change in the dielectric function .",
    "namely , at some value @xmath19 , the dielectric function becomes negative for small wavevectors @xcite . rather than surrounded by a screening cloud of opposite charge in its immediate vicinity",
    ", the test charge now becomes overscreened .",
    "the coulomb potential rapidly drops below zero with increasing distance and becomes attractive for like charges .",
    "further away from the test charge , the potential exhibits an exponentially damped oscillatory behavior and periodically changes sign similar to friedel oscillations .",
    "the initial drop of the coulomb potential to negative values and the resulting overscreening is , however , unrelated to friedel oscillations @xcite .",
    "overscreening in a plasma was first noted in a 2d bose gas with a @xmath20 coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "the fundamental change in the screening behavior of a 3deg is paralleled by a modification of its ground state . at the critical electron number density , where the dielectric function becomes negative for small wavevectors and a test charge",
    "overscreened , the compressibility changes sign as well .",
    "as argued in the following , the homogeneous ground state of the regime with positive compressibility then gives way to a ground state with a periodic modulation of the charge density , which is , however , exponentially damped .",
    "at weak coupling , the dielectric function can be written for small wavevectors as @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 the fourier transform of the ( unscreened ) coulomb potential , and @xmath23 the _ screened _ density - density response function at zero wavevector and frequency .",
    "the screened response function , a theoretic construct to be distinguished from the physical one , measures the response to a screened external field rather that the external field itself .",
    "physically , this function describes a fictitious system with only short - range interactions that are remnants of the long - range coulomb interaction after the screening mechanism of the 3deg has taken effect @xcite .",
    "derived from the coulomb interaction , the short - range interactions of the fictitious system vanish in the limit @xmath24 .    in writing eq .",
    "( [ epsilonsmall ] ) , the @xmath25 term in the taylor expansion of @xmath26 is assumed to be substantially smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "this is true only at weak coupling .",
    "for example , when @xmath28 , the value of the constant term in eq.([epsilonsmall ] ) is reduced already by about 6  % .",
    "the compressibility sum rule relates the screened response function to the compressibility @xmath29 of the 3deg via @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 the chemical potential .",
    "if positive , the compressibility can be expressed in terms of the speed of sound @xmath32 in the fictitious system with only short - range interactions as @xmath33 equation ( [ epsilonsmall ] ) can then be cast in the equivalent form @xmath34 corresponding to the spectrum @xmath35 of the plasma mode , where @xmath36 denotes the plasma frequency , @xmath37 .",
    "the plasmon spectrum differs from the gapless spectrum @xmath38 of the sound mode of the fictitious system in that , due to the long range of the coulomb interaction , the former has an energy gap . at short wavelengths @xmath39 ,",
    "the difference is negligible , thereby allowing use of the plasmon to access , via @xmath32 , the screened interaction as a function of the coupling constant  at least for @xmath40 .    in the limit @xmath24",
    ", the screened response function reduces to ( minus ) the density of states @xmath41 at the fermi surface .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the fermi velocity , and the thomas - fermi approximation for the dielectric function is recovered .    owing to its short - range interactions ,",
    "the fictitious system can be described by fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "the elementary excitations are fermionic quasiparticles of mass @xmath44 , with an interaction characterized by spin symmetric ( s ) and spin antisymmetric ( a ) landau parameters @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the angular momentum channel .",
    "the landau parameters depend on @xmath13 and vanish in the limit @xmath24 , where also @xmath47 .",
    "the speed of sound in the fictitious system can be expressed in these parameters as follows @xmath48 due to the pauli exclusion principle , even with an attractive interaction , a fermi liquid can still support a sound mode , provided that @xmath49 .",
    "approximate calculations @xcite indicate that the effective mass is comparable to the free electron mass , while the landau parameter @xmath50 is negative .",
    "the latter implies an _ attractive _ quasiparticle interaction in the spin - symmetric , @xmath51 channel , although it derives from the coulomb interaction , which repulses like charges .",
    "this unexpected finding has the same origin as the overscreening of a test charge .",
    "at the level of the first - order correction to the ground - state energy of a free fermi gas , which itself is a 1-loop result , the origin can be understood as follows @xcite .",
    "two feynman diagrams contribute to the 2-loop , or hartree - fock correction : the direct , or hartree term containing two fermion loops , and the exchange term containing only one fermion loop .",
    "owing to overall charge neutrality , the direct term does not contribute to the ground - state energy , so that only the exchange term remains .",
    "containing an odd number of fermion loops , this term comes with a minus sign , thus reversing the sign of the coulomb interaction .",
    "consequently , the ground - state energy per electron and also the pressure decrease with increasing coupling constant for @xmath52 , eventually becoming negative .",
    "the inverse compressibility of the 3deg and therefore the speed of sound @xmath32 in the fictitious system also decrease with increasing @xmath13 . at a certain value @xmath53 , with @xmath54 according to estimates @xcite",
    ", the inverse compressibility becomes negative and the speed of sound drops to zero , implying that the factor @xmath55 should vanish .",
    "the approximate calculations @xcite indicate that the quasiparticle mass increases only slightly with increasing @xmath13 , while the values of @xmath56 for @xmath57 show a tendency towards @xmath58 around @xmath53 .",
    "we conjecture that precisely at this point , @xmath59 . in fermi",
    "liquid theory @xcite , this value of the landau parameter @xmath56 , where @xmath23 diverges , signifies the onset of instability , with the homogeneous ground state becoming unstable towards density fluctuations .",
    "the vanishing of the sound mode of the fictitious system affects the plasmon spectrum .",
    "the general condition for plasma oscillations at a frequency @xmath60 is @xcite @xmath61 . at zero frequency , or energy ,",
    "the condition reduces to @xmath62 where an additional factor @xmath63 is included for convenience .",

    "consider condition ( [ condition ] ) first at weak coupling , where the dielectric function reduces to the form ( [ epsilonsmall ] ) in the limit of long wavelengths .",

    "purely _ imaginary wavevector as a solution , and a screening length @xmath66 . in the limit @xmath24",
    ", this formula reduces to the thomas - fermi result @xmath67 being proportional to the inverse square root of the coupling constant , the screening length ( [ screeningf ] ) measured in units of the interparticle distance @xmath68 becomes infinite as @xmath13 approaches zero .    at @xmath53 , where the dielectric function becomes negative for small wavevectors , resulting in the overscreening of a test charge",
    ", the solution of the condition ( [ condition ] ) changes qualitatively . in the region @xmath69 ,",
    "the plasmon spectrum initially decreases with increasing wavevector , until reaching a ( positive ) minimum after which it increases @xcite .",
    "the unique character of the point @xmath53 can also be noted when considering the spatial average of the electrostatic potential generated by the static test charge at the origin @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "when the inverse compressibility becomes negative , the overall potential changes sign as well .",
    "to investigate the strong - coupling regime , we use a parametrized expression for the local - field correction @xmath72 as it appears in the generalized random phase approximation of the screened response function : @xmath73 proposed by ichimaru and utsumi @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath74 denotes the response function of a free fermi gas at zero frequency .",
    "the random phase approximation is recovered by setting @xmath72 to unity . since only the zero - frequency response function",
    "is required to study the condition ( [ condition ] ) , we can sidestep the difficulties which arise when the frequency dependence is included in @xmath72 to arrive at the dynamic correction .",
    "the parametrized expression , which applies to the range @xmath75 , incorporates monte carlo data on the ground - state energy @xcite as well as the ladder diagram calculation of the pair distribution function at zero separation @xcite .",
    "importantly , the resulting dielectric function satisfies a number of exact boundary conditions and sum rules , including the compressibility sum rule ( [ compressibility ] ) . as noted in the overview @xcite , these features and its simplicity makes the parametrized expression proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite convenient for applications .",
    "the compressibility sum rule determines the behavior of the local - field correction at long wavelengths . with the definition @xmath76 where @xmath77 , it follows from eq.([compressibility ] ) and a similar expression for the noninteracting system with compressibility @xmath78 , that the coefficient @xmath79 is related to the compressibility via @xmath80 the compressibility of a 3deg can be extracted from the monte carlo data of ceperly and alder @xcite thus fixing @xmath79 .",
