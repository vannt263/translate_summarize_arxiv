    "the term `` space '' will mean the amount of space in ques . in the fdp ,",
    "temperature decreases with height from the source .",

    "the principles of change and repetition requires that the three dimensions ( 3d ) be created from two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the creation of 3d from zero dimensions ( 0d ) is not only unlikely but forbidden .",
    "the universe begins with a change that may be a rupture of 0d .",
    "the change itself is a beginning of time .",
    "the 0d ruptures to create one dimensional ( 1d ) points and space between the points on a line .",
    "the 0d is a source of 1d and continually ejects space into one end of the 1d line .",
    "the other end must expand into the void .",
    "thus , the 1d line is continually growing .",
    "the 1d line has only one direction .",
    "therefore , the 1d line is straight .",
    "the 1d energy is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the point tension , @xmath34 is time elapsed between point eruption , @xmath35 is the line space density , and @xmath36 is the length between points .",
    "the first transition creates length and time @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the constant of proportionality .    when points in 1d rupture , the 2d space is inserted into 2d at many points along the 1d line .",
    "the rupture can have no component remaining in 1d .",
    "thus , a right angle is defined and the metric coefficients equal one ( a cartesian plane ) .",
    "accordingly , 2d is flat .",
    "the 2d energy for each transition is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the line tension , @xmath36 is the line length , @xmath41 is the area space density , and @xmath42 is the area .",
    "a 2d sink is at a place in 2d that has space tightly contained in a line .",
    "the line is a one - dimensional border in 2d .",
    "if a line with a `` line tension '' compressing space is deformed perpendicular to the line , an arc of height @xmath43 is formed .",
    "the geometric constant of the line is its length @xmath36 .",
    "if a condition of @xmath44 is reached , a bubble in 2d is formed .",
    "the end points of the line are coincident .",
    "this rupture causes space to be removed from the 2d plane .",
    "this 2d sink becomes a source in 3d space .",
    "the line becomes an object in 3d called a hod .",
    "the hod is the smallest piece of matter from which all other matter is constructed .",
    "the hod is supple so that its shape may change in 3d .",
    "the edge of the 2d plane expands into the void .",
    "hence , the distance between the points that rupture into 3d is increasing .",
    "the expansion is recurrent and is in 2d , not 3d . because the rupture into 3d is orthogonal to 2d , 3d is flat ( cartesian three space dimensions ) , also .",
    "the @xmath36 becomes area @xmath11 .",
    "the space area in 2d becomes the volume @xmath45 of space density @xmath2 in 3d .",
    "one que is the amount of space released by one hod in the transition .",
    "since nothing exists in 3d except because of the transitions , the energy for a transition is @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the initial @xmath2 and @xmath45 at the transition , respectively , and @xmath49 is the proportionality constant called surface tension .    similarly , corollary ii of the fundamental principle implies a 3d sink may be formed",
    ".    succeeding ruptures at the same point adds space and hods to the universe .",
    "since we observe there is space and @xmath2 in our neighborhood , the space and hods then flow from the source and creates the galaxy around the source .    the total energy transferred into 3d from eq .  ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total number of hods in the universe .    in the observed universe ,",
    "the 2d plane is common for all sources .",
    "as the space from a source expands into the void , it encounters other space from other sources . since all space originates from one 0d source , the merged space is causally correlated and coherent .",
    "however , 2d space is distinct from 3d space .    in 2d , the surface was a tightly bound line on the outside of space . in 3d",
    ", space is on the outside of a surface .",
    "the @xmath52 on the 2d space was high enough to contain the space .",
    "now @xmath52 acts to attract 3d space .",
    "since the hod formed in the extreme pressure of the source , the @xmath52 maximum ability to act on space exceeds the pressure of space on the hod away from the source .",
    "since @xmath49 and @xmath11 are constant , as the extent of the volume @xmath45 increases so @xmath2 must decrease . therefore , the hod applies its energy , @xmath53 , on the space immediately surrounding the hod .",
    "since the hod contained the space before release and space was at a much higher @xmath2 than is surrounding the hod in 3d , all the hod s tensional energy is exerted on space .",
    "a hod is a 2d discontinuity in the continuity of 3d space .",
    "these discontinuities are surfaces in space with an edge not containing loops .",
    "hods are discrete .",
    "the mathematics of integer numbers can then be used to count hods .",
    "in addition , hods can combine , one with another .",
    "the number of hods and the structure of the combinations of hods create the different particles and forces , except gravity , of the universe .",
    "therefore , the language of hods is integer numbers , structures , counting , subtraction , and summation .",
    "space is continuous , perfectly elastic , and compressible .",
    "the space continuously fills the region it occupies except for the hods .",
    "transformation of space over time is continuous .",
    "hods and the outer edge of space as it expands into the void are discontinuities in space .",
    "space really can meet the mathematical criteria of considering an arbitrarily small volume .",
    "therefore , the language of space is real numbers , tensors , field theories , differentiation , and integrals",
    ".    the three interactions of concern are that each hod exerts a force on space , space exerts a force on the hod , and space exerts a force on adjacent space .",
    "a hod is not attracted or repelled by other hods through a field or other action at a distance device .",
    "since @xmath49 can act only perpendicular to the hod s surface , the force space exerts on the hod is perpendicular to the surface of the hod .",
    "there are three dimensions in our universe .",
    "counting is a characteristic of hods .",
    "therefore , that our universe is three - dimensional is a characteristic of the hods and not of space .",
    "there are two concepts of distance .",
    "distance can be by reference to a fixed grid .",
    "traditional methods have used space as the fixed grid . in this model",
    ", distance is a multiple of the average diameter a hod .",
    "since @xmath11 is a constant and the hod may be deformed , the hod average diameter will be considered a constant throughout the universe beyond the source and in moving and accelerating reference frames .",
    "the measure of distance will be a `` ho '' , which is defined as the average diameter of the hod .",
    "the cum uses ho distance to form a grid in a flat universe with @xmath54    another concept of distance is the amount of space between two surfaces . by analogy , this type of distance in gas is the amount of gas between two surfaces . increasing the amount of gas between the two surfaces increases the distance .",
    "one way to do this is by movement of the surfaces .",
    "another way is to add more gas from a source .",
    "if the medium is compressible , the distance measured by the amount of gas varies with the change in density of the medium .",
    "the cum model allows space to be compressible .",
    "therefore , the amount of space between two surfaces can change if the @xmath2 ( que ho@xmath20 ) of the space between two surfaces changes",
    ".    the terms distance , length , area , and volume will refer to ho measurements .",
    "the unit of measure of distance is usually expressed in km , pc , kpc , or mpc . if the measurement is taken by means of angular observation or time - between - events observations such as using cepheid variables that do not depend on the amount of space , the units of pc are proportional to the ho unit .",
    "since the proportionality constant is unknown , the units of pc will be used .",
    "however , if the measurement such as redshift depends on the amount of space , the units of pc should be used with caution .",
    "since the hods are discrete , @xmath30(@xmath34 ) is a digital function in time .",
    "the hod exerts a tremendous @xmath49 to hold the space in its 2d surroundings .",
    "upon transition , the space immediately around the hod experiences an instantaneous addition to the amount of space in the 3d universe .",
    "this step function creates a shockwave in the surrounding space .",
    "space then flows out into the void causing the @xmath45 of space to increase and a @xmath2 variation in the @xmath45 .",
    "if space has no relaxation time and no maximum gradient , the eruption of space from a source would spread out instantly so that @xmath2 would be virtually zero everywhere .",
    "since we observe space in our region of the universe , the anthropic principle implies space flow must have a relaxation time and a maximum @xmath2 gradient ( @xmath55 ) that is a constant of the universe .",
    "bold face type denotes a vector .",
    "since space has a relaxation time , the mirror property in hods is inertia @xmath56 per @xmath11 .",
    "a hod is an object with an area @xmath11 , a surface tension per unit area @xmath52 , and inertia per unit area @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath11 , the magnitude of @xmath52 , and the @xmath56 are the same for all hods and are universal constants .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath56 furnish a resistance to deformation on the hod .",
    "since @xmath11 is a constant , a deformation of a hod causes the edge to change shape .    in the region around an active source , @xmath57 .",
    "space expands into the void where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , at some radius @xmath60 from the source , @xmath2 becomes another function of time and distance from the source . at @xmath60 ,",

    "the hod s @xmath56 inhibits the movement .",
    "thus , a feedback condition is established wherein the d@xmath63/d@xmath34 is balanced by @xmath56 . therefore , the hods movement is proportional to the total inertia @xmath66 of the hod and to the velocity of the hod .",

    "an outcome of an experiment includes placing bounds on what ( parameter or event ) , where ( position coordinates ) , and when ( time coordinate ) .",
    "the level of a physical system refers to the size of the domain of applicability over which a set of physical theories applies such as galaxies versus atoms and newtonian versus special relativity .",
    "corollary i is if a candidate to be a fundamental principle is found to not apply in some system then it is not a fundamental principle .",
    "corollary ii is if a principle is found in all of physical systems , then it is likely to apply to larger and smaller levels and to new concepts .",
    "the principle of superposition , the correspondence principle , and principle of minimum potential energy are such fundamental principles .",
    "the correspondence principle is an interpolation of the fundamental principles .",
    "corollary ii is an extrapolation of the fundamental principle .    a `` scientific model '' ( theory )",

    "a proposal becomes a scientific model when a deduction from it can be found to be factual ( is observed ) .",

    "destruction of objects to have `` room '' for `` the new '' is a repetition because the only objects that can be built from the pieces are a repetition of objects .",
    "the principle of negative feedback states that any system with a relatively narrow parameter relationships must evolve from a broader system and must have a negative feedback loop to maintain the narrow parameters and achieve balance between the change and repetition processes . otherwise , the system is unstable and transitory .",

    "we observe objects that have limited size .",
    "so , there is a limiting force or negative feedback condition controlling the size of each object .",
    "so too must black holes have a size limitation and a negative feedback condition .",
    "the principle of minimum potential energy can be stated as a principle of minimum action , which states the path of least energy expenditure will be followed during the change from one state to another . combining this with the principle of negative feedback yields the conclusion that the feedback energy equations are linear , of the first time derivative , and of the first time integral . in an equation none ,",
    "one , or two of these elements may be zero . since a higher power feedback equation would result in the same controlled output and consume more energy , the minimum equations are sufficient .",
    "therefore , the assumption of `` linear '' in formulating descriptive , negative feedback energy equations is sufficient .",
    "the principle of geometric rules states that the observed geometric relationships apply in all levels of systems .",
