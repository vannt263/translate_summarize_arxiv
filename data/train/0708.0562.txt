    "the network theory is generally used to investigate complex systems with many interacting agents .",
    "the financial market , where all listed companies are correlated with each other , has received attention as a typical complex system @xcite .",
    "a popular method is the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) which constructs the asset tree using correlations between stock prices @xcite .",
    "it gives us the characteristic feature of the market in the simple way . in a mst of @xmath0 nodes ,",
    "each node represents a company and @xmath1 links with the most important correlations are selected .",
    "the mst is a loop - less network , and every node at least has a link .",
    "also , the grouping of companies in the mst can be identified and extended to portfolio optimization and the companies of the us market are clearly grouped with the industry category or business sector @xcite .",
    "several papers show that the characteristics of the mature market can not be simply extended to the emerging market @xcite and change dynamically due to the globalization @xcite . especially , the korean market is synchronized to external markets due to the globalization , and the tendency of grouping by industry categories disappeared @xcite .",
    "in addition , the korean market forms clusters according to the msci index after 2000 and the tendency of synchronization to the us market is stronger and stronger @xcite .",
    "the japanese market attracts many econophysicists since its unique character @xcite .",
    "it is not an emerging one but it has a strong connection with the asian emerging markets .",
    "for instance , the korean market has many common features with the japanese market .",
    "korea and japan have developed close interdependence of their economic systems for a long time .",
    "two countries experienced very high rate of economic growth .",
    "their economies were commonly driven by the government - directed investment model and the protective trade policy at first .",
    "in addition , the integration into the global economy has much developed in the recent days , especially in the asia .",
    "such violent changes make the studies of the asian financial markets very interesting .",
    "we investigated characteristics of the japanese stock market with the history of the market .",
    "first , we compared the analysis of the japanese market with that of the korean market and found common features of these two markets such as decreasing of grouping by industry categories .",
    "second , we used s&p500 index as the international market to reduce external influences due to the globalization .",
    "this study showed that the international market obviously influences the japanese market .",
    "there are several stock exchange markets in japan , and we selected the tokyo stock exchange ( tse ) , the largest japanese market .",
    "we used the daily closing stock price from 1980 to 2004 , and a total of 624 companies remained for the full 25 year - period were selected for our analysis . to demonstrate the trend of the japanese market",
    ", we plot the index which averages over the 624 companies in fig .",
    "[ indexjapan ] .",
    "the logarithmic return is defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the closing price of a given japanese company @xmath4 . and",
    ", the cross - correlation coefficient between stock @xmath4 and @xmath5 is defined as :    @xmath6    to explore the evolution of the market , we construct the msts with time windows of width @xmath7 corresponding to daily data for _ 3 years _ , sliding the window with 20 trading day , approximately 1 month .",
    "each node of the mst corresponds to a company , and each link has a weight @xmath8 , which is simply the value of the cross - correlation coefficient .    to investigate the group dynamics of the financial market more detail ,",
    "we define a quantity , _ grouping coefficient _ , to measure how well groups with the industry categories ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 represents the number of whole links in the network , and @xmath11 is the number of links between companies in the same industry category .    in our previous study @xcite",
    ", we found the grouping coefficient of the recent korean market decreases with elapsing time .",
    "in other words , the recent korean market does not make the groups by industry categories even though the recent us market s mst is grouped well by industry categories @xcite . as expected ,",
    "we observe the similar trend in the japanese market ( fig .",
    "[ gjapan ] ) . before the mid-1980s",
    ", the coefficient @xmath12 of the japanese market shows no special movement .",
    "however , the coefficient tends to decrease after the mid-1980s , and this tendency is strengthened more and more by burst of the bubble in 1990 s .",
    "it is natural to form groups of industry categories , because companies included in the same category are highly related to each other in comparison to companies in other categories .",
    "however , the groups of industry categories are breaking down in recent , and it is related to the globalization of asian markets .",
    "we will explain more in the following section .",
    "the us stock market is a dominating one over the whole world , especially to the asian markets .",
    "thus , we choose the us market as a representative of the international market in the section .",
    "recently , the us market s influence to japan is more powerful in comparison with the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath13-th day s us market ( represented by s&p500 index ) and @xmath14-th day s japanese market are highly correlated , and totally we have 4126 days from the 25-year data set .",
    "we use these days closing data of each japanese company and s&p500 index , and fig .",
    "[ indexjpus ] shows the indexes and logarithmic returns for new data set of the japanese and us markets , respectively .",
    "we define the _ modified logarithmic return _ for a given japanese company @xmath4 at time @xmath15 , @xmath16 , to minimize the influence of the us market ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 represents a given japanese company @xmath4 s log return at time @xmath15 and @xmath19 is the s&p500 index s log return at time @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 value represents the cross - correlation defined in eq.([correlation ] ) between the japanese company @xmath4 and s&p500 index within 3 years from time @xmath15 , and @xmath22 is the rescaling coefficient .    , or modified one , @xmath23 , and the s&p500 index , @xmath24 .",
    "the dash line is a guideline of the value of 0.0 .",

    "( b ) rescaled grouping coefficients as a function of time for the japanese market .",
    "they are calculated by @xmath16 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the dash line is a guideline of the value of 1.0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we calculate the cross - correlation between a japanese company stock @xmath4 s logarithm return or modified one at time @xmath15 and the s&p index at time @xmath25 , and then take the average of these cross - correlations at the same time .",
    "[ modifiedg](a ) shows these averages as a function of the time ( the dot line is for the original return while the solid line is for the modified one ) .",
    "if the us market s influence to the japanese market is minimized , the correlation between the modified logarithm return of the japanese market and the s&p500 index approaches zero .",
    "thus , we search the proper @xmath22 value in eq .",
    "[ modifiedreturn ] , and find the value of 2.25 makes these cross - correlations almost zero .",
    "the meaning of the alpha value remains an open question .",
    "other financial markets that synchronize to foreign market might have their own alpha value .    according to fig .",
    "[ modifiedg](a ) , the us market and the original japanese market are rather anti - correlated from 750-day to 1500-day .",
    "it is from a big crash of the japanese market . in fig .",
    "[ indexjpus](a ) , it is found a crash at this period in the japanese market .",
    "however , the index of the us market does not decrease ( fig .",
    "[ indexjpus](b ) ) , and the width of time windows @xmath7 in this paper is 3 @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the cross - correlation between two markets has rather bigger negative value at this 3-year period which contains the japanese market crash .",
    "that is why the sharp fall and jump are appeared in fig .",
    "[ modifiedg](a ) .",
    "it is interesting that the @xmath27 value of 2.25 also makes the cross - correlations zero through this anti - correlated period .",
    "[ modifiedg](b ) represents the _ relative _ grouping coefficients , @xmath28 , calculated by @xmath16 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we use the relative values to compare two grouping coefficients dynamical features together . both of the grouping coefficients with @xmath29 and @xmath30 decrease after 1990 .",
    "however , the tendency of the coefficient s decrease with @xmath30 is smaller than that of @xmath29 .",
    "it means the decreasing of the grouping coefficient is related to the globalization .",
    "nowadays , the japanese market is synchronized to the us market @xcite , and the groups by the industry categories are broken down like the korean market .",
    "in addition , the recent korean market can be grouped in terms of the msci korea index @xcite .",
    "the companies included in the msci korea index are more synchronized to a foreign market , and these companies make a group .",
    "the other groups consist of companies not included in the msci index .",
    "thus , the grouping coefficient of the korean market is decreasing in recent @xcite .",
    "we investigated the japanese stock market networks using the daily closing stock price .",
    "we show that the grouping coefficients of the market decreased with elapsing time and the number of groups according to industry categories decreased .",
    "it is similar to the analysis of the korean market , which has many common features with the japanese one .    and",
    ", we defined the modified logarithmic return to minimize the external us market s influence . when it is minimized",
    ", the grouping coefficient is rather increased in comparison with the original coefficient .",
    "it means the decreasing of the coefficient is correlated to the external influences to the market . currently , most world markets synchronize to the us market , and they are sensitive to foreign factors",
