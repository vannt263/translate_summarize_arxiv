    "mean - field theories are widely employed to analyze a large variety of many - body systems where an independent - particle picture can be adopted . in nuclear physics , mean - field approaches generally lead to satisfactory results when applied to several bulk properties of atomic nuclei such as masses , radii , or ground - state deformations . in some cases , however , in nuclear physics as well as in other domains of many - body physics , mean - field approaches need definite improvements .",
    "for instance , in the nuclear case , mean - field models do not predict accurately the single - particle spectra ( namely , energies , spectroscopic factors and fragmentation of the single - particle states , especially close to the fermi energy ) : the mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) occupation numbers are strictly equal to 0 or 1 and , therefore , the spectroscopic factors of single - particle states can not be reproduced . to improve the theoretical description ,",
    "one may introduce the coupling between nucleon individual degrees of freedom and collective degrees of freedom by means of the particle - vibration coupling approach @xcite .",
    "this model constitutes an example of beyond mean - field theories .",
    "a conceptual problem is often encountered when beyond mean - field theories are employed in nuclear physics where the most widely used interactions are phenomenological .",
    "that is , the parameters of these interactions already take into account in an effective way several correlations .",
    "hence , their use in beyond mean - field models ( where correlations are explicitly introduced ) may lead to a double counting .",
    "this difficulty could be removed in principle by adjusting the parameters directly at the beyond mean - field level .",
    "an additional practical problem appears in beyond mean - field theories where the interaction has zero range . in the nuclear case ,",
    "all the terms of the skyrme interaction , and the density - dependent and spin - orbit terms of the gogny interaction have zero range . due to this",
    ", ultraviolet divergences are generated in the diagrams beyond hf , so that the numerical results are dependent on the choice of the energy cutoff .",
    "different procedures to regularize the divergences that appear beyond hf may be adopted .",
    "for example , in the context of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov or bogoliubov - de gennes model ( where an ultraviolet divergence is generated if a zero - range pairing interaction is used ) a currently employed regularization is based on the so - called pseudo - potential prescription @xcite .",
    "this procedure has been proposed in nuclear @xcite and in atomic @xcite physics .",
    "another example is the cutoff regularization which is adopted in this work , where we change the cutoff and adjust simultaneously the parameters of the skyrme effective interaction to keep the energy per particle at the beyond mean - field approximation independent of the cutoff regulator .",
    "a third example is the elegant procedure of the dimensional regularization which has been developed in the 70s in the context of the electroweak theory @xcite and which is widely employed nowadays in perturbative quantum field theories to regularize the divergent integrals .",
    "the basic idea of this regularization technique consists in replacing the dimension @xmath3 of the integrals with a continuous variable .",
    "the dimensional regularization ( at variance with the cutoff regularization ) preserves translational , gauge and lorentz symmetries @xcite and this explains its wide diffusion and success in the framework of quantum field theories .    the ultraviolet divergence appearing beyond the mean - field approach has been discussed in a previous work @xcite , where the nature of the divergence has been analyzed in the case of symmetric nuclear matter within a simplified @xmath4 skyrme model .",
    "the used interaction was @xmath5 , where the coupling constant is density dependent and equal to @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parameters .",
    "the second - order correction to the mean - field equation of state ( eos ) , that is , the lowest - order term beyond hf , has been studied analytically in detail .",
    "the precise nature of the divergence , which is linear in the momentum cutoff @xmath2 , can be put in evidence by using the results of ref . @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the linear divergence in @xmath2 can be explicitly shown by taking the asymptotic expansion ( for @xmath10 ) of eq .",
    "( 8) of ref . @xcite .",
    "this expansion reads    @xmath11    for different values of @xmath2 , new sets of parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) have been adjusted to reproduce a reference eos for symmetric matter . in practice , the mean - field eos of the skp skyrme force @xcite has been chosen as a benchmark .",
    "this choice has been suggested by the fact that , for the skp parametrization , only the @xmath7 and @xmath8 terms actually appear in the eos for symmetric matter . in the framework of such cutoff regularization , the choice of @xmath2 has been dictated by physical criteria . as already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , since in low - energy nuclear physics nucleons are treated as point particles , @xmath2 must be definitely smaller than 2 @xmath12",
    ". this value of @xmath2 will be the maximum cutoff adopted in this work . in the present work , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is considerably extended .",
    "the full skyrme interaction is taken into account and both symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter ( including the limiting case of pure neutron matter ) are considered .",
    "the latter point is particularly important since we show here that the obtained interaction fitted for several values of @xmath2 to a chosen benchmark eos is very accurate for a wide range of densities and neutron - proton asymmetries as well as for large values of the momentum cutoff . at variance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we have chosen here the sly5 @xcite skyrme parametrization to generate the mean - field eos which has been adopted as a benchmark .    the article is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "ii the analytical expressions of the second - order contribution associated to the full skyrme interaction are described , and the nature of the divergence is analyzed . in sec .",
    "iii the numerical results for the eos ( with different values of @xmath2 ) are displayed , and the fit of the 9 skyrme parameters is firstly done separately in the case of symmetric ( subsec .",
    "iii.a ) , pure neutron ( subsec .",
    "iii.b ) , and asymmetric ( subsec .",
    "iv.c ) matter .",
    "finally , we show a global fit for the three cases in subsec .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we treat the eos of nuclear matter by adding the second - order correction to the first - order mean - field energy .",
    "the eos @xmath13 is thus written as the sum of four diagrams which are displayed in fig . 1 and which represent the direct ( left ) and exchange ( right ) first - order ( upper line ) and second - order ( lower line ) contributions . as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , we use in this paper a standard skyrme interaction like sly5 in its complete form , namely    @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & t_2(1+x_2p_{\\sigma}){\\vec k}'\\cdot\\delta({\\vec r}_1- { \\vec r}_2){\\vec k } + \\frac{1}{6 } t_3 ( 1+x_3p_{\\sigma})\\rho^{\\alpha}({\\vec r } ) \\delta({\\vec r}_1-{\\vec r}_2)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & iw_0 ( { \\sigma}_1+{\\sigma}_2)\\cdot[{\\vec k}'\\times \\delta({\\vec r}_1-{\\vec r}_2){\\vec k}]~ , \\label{eq2.1 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath18 ( acting on the left ) , @xmath19 is the spin - exchange operator .",
    "the ten parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath9 and @xmath22 characterize a given skyrme set . in uniform matter the spin - orbit force does not play any role , and the associated parameter @xmath22 does not show up in any of the quantities discussed below .",
    "consequently , we consider only the remaining nine free parameters .    using the general skyrme force of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 - 1 ] ) , the energy per particle in uniform matter can be easily written . the mean - field ( or hf ) result can be found in several papers .",
    "the result including both hf and the second - order correction reads    @xmath23   + \\frac{1}{48 } t_3 \\rho^{\\alpha+1 } [ 2(2+x_3)-(1 + 2x_3)g_2 ] \\\\ & + &   \\frac{3}{40}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi^2}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{5}{3 } } \\rho^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\left [ \\theta_v g_{5/3 } + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\theta_s -2 \\theta_v )   g_{8/3 } \\right ] + \\frac{\\delta e^{(2)}(\\delta , \\rho , \\lambda)}{a } ,   \\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the asymmetry parameter , @xmath25 in eq .",

    "( [ eq15 ] ) , depends not only on @xmath31 and @xmath24 but on the momentum cutoff @xmath2 as well .",
    "its derivation is discussed in what follows .    to have a more compact notation ,",
    "let us write the second - order correction as @xmath32 by omitting the explicit dependence on @xmath24 , @xmath31 and @xmath2 , @xmath33    the direct @xmath34 and the exchange @xmath35 contributions for the neutron - neutron ( @xmath36 ) and proton - proton ( @xmath37 ) channels are written in a box of volume @xmath38 as    @xmath39    where @xmath40 represents the interaction in momentum space and @xmath41 denotes either @xmath42 or @xmath43 . to simplify the notation , in @xmath44 and @xmath45 we have included the factors resulting from the fact that the sum over spin and isospin indices has been performed .",
