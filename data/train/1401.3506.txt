    "the multi - hop relay transmission has potential to offer low - cost , high - speed and long - range wireless communications .",
    "the multi - hop relay transmission will be adopted in the new standards ( e.g. , wimax or ieee 802.16 m ) . in such standards ,",
    "the multi - hop relay capability is enabled for legacy network terminal devices ( tds ) ( e.g. , access points and routers ) . in this context , the wireless relay network ( wrn ) has recently emerged as one of the focuses on next generation wireless networks . in the wrn ,",
    "relay transmission based on cooperation among tds can mitigate channel fading and exploit spatial reuse to accommodate concurrent transmissions , thus potentially increasing network capacity and coverage .",
    "existing works  @xcite have demonstrated that a significant performance improvement can be achieved in the wrns in terms of higher throughput , lower bit error rate , better capacity , compared to traditional single - hop transmission used in the current cellular network  @xcite .",
    "this paper considers the multi - hop network structure formed by tds from multiple service providers ( sps ) with the purpose of capacity improvement .",
    "multiple sps may form coalitions to let their tds serve the transmission demand of each other , with the goal to increase the sps aggregated revenue  @xcite .",
    "the utilization of available resources , i.e. , vacant tds ( which can relay the data for other tds ) and network capacity , can be substantially improved through forming sp coalitions .",
    "this is beneficial to sps because , in some wrns , tds are deployed dispersedly . for each",
    "sp , if there is no cooperation , the limited number of available vacant tds and their dispersive locations largely confine the link capacity for data transmission .",
    "the cooperation among sps could increase the number of available vacant tds for each sp which in turn can improve network capacity .",
    "accordingly , a larger amount of traffic demand can be served by more efficiently resource utilization in the wrn , which leads to higher aggregated revenue for sps .",
    "the cooperation in the wrn also benefits tds because a cooperative relay may substantially lead to improved network capacity and thus increased throughput for the tds .",
    "we call the formation of this interrelated sp cooperation and td cooperation as the layered cooperation problem , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "previous work has also considered game - theoretic framework with layers / hierarchies , e.g. , @xcite in the cognitive radio networks , @xcite in two - tier femtocell networks and @xcite in wrns . however , most of the works considered the competition relationship between different layers , which belongs to the stackelberg game concept @xcite . in our work ,",
    "different layers interact to improve the benefit of each other cooperatively .",
    "although cooperation in the wrn brings significant benefits , three major challenges arise .",
    "first , what is the coalitional structure desirable for all sps ?",
    "second , how shall the aggregated utility ( i.e. , revenue ) be allocated to each sp in the coalition in a fair manner so that none of sps is willing to leave the coalition ?",
    "third , what is the stable network structure for tds of cooperative sps to perform uplink transmission ?",
    "this paper addresses these three challenges .",
    "we consider a multi - cell wrn consisting of multiple bss and tds deployed by different sps .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the sets of sps and bss , respectively .",
    "@xmath2 is the set of tds of sp @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the total number of tds belonging to sp @xmath3 , for @xmath5 .",
    "we call the td with and without transmission demand at a specific time as the source td and vacant td , respectively . in the wrn",
    ", multi - hop relaying is used to route the flow from the source td to the destination bs .",
    "we assume that each td @xmath6 is connected to a bs through at most one path and each vacant td can only work as a relay for one td .",
    "we formulate a layered game theoretic model , referred to as the layered coalitional game , to model the decision - making process of cooperation between the sps and tds . the sps aim to maximize their individual utility , while the tds attempt to maximize their end - to - end throughput with the help of tds from cooperative sps . in the proposed game ,",
    "sps need to decide on the coalitional structure to form to improve their individual as well as aggregated utility .",
    "also , the tds need to make decisions to form a relay network structure to improve throughput .",
    "the utility of an sp is defined as the revenue ( earned for meeting the transmission demand of tds ) subtracted by td cost and coalition cost .",
    "the td cost accounts for the energy consumption of tds in transmitting and forwarding packets .",
    "the coalition cost accounts for the factors such as communication cost ( i.e. , packet overhead for information exchange between tds from different sps ) and operation cost ( i.e. , energy consumed for information exchange ) . recognizing the behavior of sps and tds , we propose to use the overlapping coalition formation game to model the behavior of sps and the link formation game to characterize the interaction among tds .",
    "an overlapping coalition formation game is formulated at the sp layer whose rational players are the sps in set @xmath7 .",
    "the coalition denoted by @xmath8 is a subset of @xmath7 , and @xmath7 is the grand coalition ( i.e , coalition of all sps ) .",
    "the _ strategy _ of the sp is to form the coalitions to improve the aggregated utility .",
    "note that different from non - overlapping coalition formation game where players have to cooperate with all others in the same coalition and each player only stays in one coalition , in the overlapping coalition formation game , each player is able to cooperate and join multiple different coalitions .",
    "thus , a non - overlapping coalition can be considered as the two - player sub - coalitions .",
    "for example , a three - player coalition @xmath9 is equivalent to three sub - coalitions @xmath10 in the overlapping coalition formation game .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath11 of coalition @xmath8 can be defined as follows : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the allocated utility of sp @xmath3 in coalition @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the set of coalitions that sp @xmath3 belongs to",
    ". the total utility function of an individual sp @xmath16 can be represented as follows : @xmath17    a coalitional structure can be defined in a characteristic function as the set @xmath18 which is a collection of non - empty subsets of @xmath7 such that @xmath19 and the sub - coalitions could overlap with each other .",
    "@xmath20 is the total number of coalitions in collection @xmath21 .",
    "the total number of possible collections for the @xmath22-sp game is denoted by @xmath23 where @xmath24    let @xmath25 be the set of all covers of @xmath7 .",
    "the cover function on @xmath7 is a function @xmath26 such that @xmath27    a coalition structure can be either _ stable _ or _",
    "unstable_. if a coalitional structure is stable , it will remain still .",
    "otherwise , the coalitional structure will transit to any other state .",
    "a coalitional structure @xmath21 is unstable under following cases : @xmath28 if there exists an sp @xmath16 which can get higher utility if it does not make any cooperation with others , i.e. , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 , if there exists an sp @xmath31 which can get higher utility by leaving the coalition @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , if there exists an sp @xmath16 , which is not a member of coalition @xmath8 , can get higher utility by joining coalition @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "the solution of the proposed overlapping coalition formation game is the stable coalitional structure for sps .",
    "a given coalitional structure @xmath21 is stable if it shows both the _ internal stability _ as well as _ external stability _  @xcite .",
    "we define the concepts of internal stability and external stability of stable overlapping coalition as follows :    * * internal stability * : if coalition @xmath35 is internally stable , none of the sps can improve its utility by leaving this coalition @xmath8 or by joining another coalition @xmath36 and @xmath37 i.e. , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . *",
    "* external stability * : if coalition @xmath8 is externally stable , there is no sp @xmath3 from other coalition set @xmath15 that can improve its utility by joining a coalition @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the internal stability prevents to get unstable coalitional structures like cases ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath45 ) , while the external stability prevents the happening of case ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "based on these concepts of stability , we propose a distributed overlapping coalition formation algorithm consisting of  merge \" and  split \" methods that are able to update the coalitional structure @xmath21 of the set @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the aggregated utility of all the sps under coalitional structure @xmath21 and the allocated utility of the sp @xmath3 associated with the coalitional structure @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "given a current set of coalitions , any sp can join or split from any coalition to increase their individual utility .",
    "thus , the sp @xmath3 belonging to a coalition set @xmath15 may also join coalition @xmath49 if this action leads to a strict increase in its allocated utility , while at the same time , does not lead to any decrease in the utility of sps already in coalition @xmath8 .",
    "mathematically , we have ,    * merge rule * : the sp @xmath16 can make cooperation with another sp @xmath50 to form a new coalition @xmath8 if the following conditions are satisfied , @xmath51    in general , with the coalitional structure @xmath52 , the sp @xmath16 can cooperate with other sps to form a new coalition @xmath8 , changing its coalition set to @xmath53 with the new coalitional structure represented as @xmath54 , if the following condition is satisfied , @xmath55 in particular , multiple sps from multiple sets of coalitions will merge and become a new coalition if the sps in the formed coalition receive higher utility .    also , the sp @xmath16 would break cooperation with another sp @xmath56 if this action leads to a strictly better individual utility .",
    "thus , we have , * split rule * : the sp @xmath57 would break cooperation with another sp @xmath58 if the following condition is satisfied , @xmath59    in general , the coalitional structure @xmath52 , sp @xmath16 can break cooperation with other sps from coalition @xmath60 , changing its coalition set to @xmath61 with the new coalitional structure represented as @xmath62 if the following condition is satisfied , @xmath63 in particular , the sp in a coalition agrees to split from the coalition if the utility of the sp is higher than that in the coalition .    denote the coalitional structure at time @xmath64 by @xmath65 .",
    "given the current coalitional structure at time @xmath64 , a new coalitional structure of sp @xmath3 can be updated following an updating rule based on the merge - and - split algorithm to maximize the instant utility .",
    "we define the update process as follows : @xmath66    with this merge - and - split updating rule , we propose the overlapping coalition formation algorithm for sps in * algorithm 1*. for dynamically changing environment ( e.g. , td failure , topology change or traffic demand change ) , the link formation algorithm , i.e. , * algorithm 2 * , is run periodically to update link information to sps . this period between each time",
    "that * algorithm 2 * is run will be based on the network environment dynamics .",
    "the more dynamic the network environment is , the smaller the period should be , so that the network structure can adapt to the environment change quickly .",
    "then , the sps accordingly adapt to environment changes by adjusting a coalitional structure .    * initial state * + in the starting network , each sp @xmath3 either has no cooperation with others or serves as a member in a coalition set @xmath15 . * coalition formation process * + * phase 1 * _ discovery _",
    "+ according to the * initial state * , tds from each sp perform _ dynamic virtual link replacement _ algorithm specified in * algorithm 2*. based on the information feedback from td layer , each sp @xmath3 calculates the corresponding aggregated utility of each coalition @xmath60 , and its share @xmath67 , @xmath68 based on some utility allocation method . *",
    "phase 2 * _ overlapping coalition formation _ + sps perform overlapping coalition formation ( i.e. , either cooperate or break cooperation ) using merge - and - split algorithm . during this process , sps which attempt to make cooperation let their tds perform the _ dynamic virtual link replacement _ algorithm and provide feedback to their sps .",
    "based on the information feedback , each sp calculates its potential share @xmath68 @xmath69 , when cooperation is reached and the sp compares it with the sp s current utility",
    ". * repeat * ( a ) @xmath70 : sps decide to make cooperation based on the * merge rule*. ( b ) @xmath71 : sps decide to break cooperation based on the * split rule*. * until * merge - and - split algorithm converges . * phase 3 * _ cooperative sharing _",
    "+ the sps in the same coalition share their vacant tds with each other for link - layer transmission .",
    "the markov chain defined by the state space of all the coalitional structures can be used to represent the overlapping coalition formation process .",
    "the state space can be denoted as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 represents the coalitional structure of all sps and @xmath23 can be obtained from ( [ number ] ) .",
    "once all sps reach the state in the set of absorbing states in the markov chain , they will remain in the set of absorbing states forever .",
    "the transition from one state to another state takes place based on the merge - and - split decision taken by the sps .",
    "@xmath74 is the reachability condition . in particular ,",
    "if collection @xmath75 is reachable from @xmath21 given the decision of all sps defined in section v , the condition @xmath74 is true and false otherwise .",
    "in addition , once the absorbing state is reached , the state transition will stop .",
    "this absorbing state is the stable coalitional structure @xmath76 , given that none of the sps has an incentive to change its decision .",
    "such a stable coalitional structure is the solution to our overlapping coalition formation game .",
    "the next step in the proposed layered coalitional game is to find a link formation algorithm that can model the interactions among the tds seeking to form a network structure to maximize the payoff ( i.e. , the end - to - end throughput of all the supporting flows ) .",
    "the _ action space _ for each transmitting td @xmath6 includes the vacant tds or bss that the transmitting td @xmath6 can connect to as the next hop . the action space for each receiving td consists of tds which this receiving td can establish a link from .",
    "when the receiving td accepts a relay request from another td , the receiving td then becomes the transmitting td and plays actions as a transmitting td does , i.e. , trying to find the next hop to improve its payoff .",
    "note that a td @xmath6 can not connect to another td @xmath77 which is already connected to @xmath6 , i.e. , if @xmath78 , then @xmath79 .",
    "note that if a source td fails to find a vacant td to form a link , this td will directly connect to a bs for uplink transmission . in this",
    "regard , prior to performing the link formation algorithm , initially all the source tds have direct link connections to the bss .",
    "please note that although a transmitting td @xmath6 establishes a link to a receiving td @xmath77 from its action space , the payoff of td @xmath6 may not always be improved .",
    "therefore , the rational action of each transmitting td @xmath6 is to select a link @xmath80 , that this transmitting td @xmath6 wants to establish from its action space , such that its payoff is improved . for the receiving td @xmath77 ,",
    "the strategy is to choose a link @xmath80 , that this receiving td @xmath77 wants to accept from its action space to improve its payoff .",
    "we assume that all the tds play their actions one by one . that is ,",
    "when a td @xmath6 plays an action , all the other tds do not take new actions .",
    "since only one td can be connected to as a relay , forming a new link @xmath80 for a relay td @xmath77 also implies disconnecting its previous link ( if any ) .",
    "that is , if td @xmath6 allows td @xmath77 to act as a relay when link @xmath81 already exists , the td @xmath77 will abandon link @xmath81 and establish the new link @xmath80 with the transmitting td @xmath6 as long as the condition @xmath82 is satisfied .",
    "this is referred to as _",
    "link replacement_.    although each td @xmath83 can play any action , there may exist some link @xmath80 that can not be established .",
    "for example , a vacant td @xmath77 may not accept the formation of @xmath84 , if it has another better option , i.e. , there exists a link @xmath81 satisfying the condition @xmath85 .",
    "hence , a _",
    "feasible strategy _ for a transmitting td @xmath6 is a link @xmath80 where the receiving td @xmath77 is willing to accept from the td @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath86 and @xmath87 satisfies @xmath88 . also , the feasible strategy for a vacant td @xmath77 is a link @xmath80 that the transmitting td @xmath6 wants to establish with td @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath86 and @xmath89 satisfies @xmath90 .",
    "we denote @xmath91 the feasible strategy space which consists of all the strategies of td @xmath6 .",
    "when the td @xmath6 plays strategy @xmath84 , while all other tds maintain their current strategies denoted by a vector @xmath92 , the resulting network graph is denoted by @xmath93 .",
    "we further consider that all the tds are myopic in the sense that each td responds to improve the payoff given the current strategies of the other tds , without the foresight of the future evolution of the network .",
    "based on this , we define the concept of _ best response _ for tds as following .",
    "a feasible strategy @xmath94 is a best response for a td @xmath83 if @xmath95 , @xmath96 .    given a network graph @xmath97 , the best response for a transmitting td @xmath6 is to form a link with a vacant td or bs among all the feasible strategies that maximizes its payoff .",
    "on the other hand , the best response for a vacant td @xmath77 is to form the link with the transmitting td @xmath6 that the td @xmath77 can help to achieve the highest increment of throughput , i.e. , @xmath98 . because the vacant td is myopic , it has the belief that the greater payoff it can help to improve , the more utility its sp will share .",
    "based on the concept of best response , we propose a link formation algorithm shown in * algorithm 2*. the link formation algorithm is run periodically , allowing the tds to adapt to the dynamic environment change .",
    "we define an iteration as a round of sequential plays during which all the tds have played their myopical strategies to respond to each other .",
    "the proposed algorithm can consist of one or more iterations . during each iteration , each td @xmath6 chooses to play its current best response @xmath99 sequentially to maximize its payoff given the current strategies of other tds .",
    "therefore , this phase is based on the iterative best response of tds .",
    "this feasible best response is indeed an iterative replacement process , as the best strategy of each td may change over time .",
    "when the algorithm converges , it results in a network in which none of the tds can improve its throughput .",
    "this is referred to as a nash network , which gives the stability concept of the final network graph @xmath100 .",
    "specifically , the nash network is defined as follows .",
    "[ nash ] a network graph @xmath101 with @xmath102 denoting the set of all vertices , i.e. tds and bss , and @xmath103 denoting the set of all edges , i.e , links between pairs of vertices , is the nash network in its feasible strategy space @xmath104 , @xmath105 , if no td @xmath83 can improve its payoff by a unilateral change in its strategy @xmath106 .    in the nash network ,",
    "all the tds choose links based on their best responses and are thus in the nash equilibrium .",
    "therefore , none of the tds can improve its payoff by unilaterally changing it current strategy .",
    "* theorem 1 : * given any initial network graph @xmath107 , the dynamic virtual link replacement algorithm of the link formation game will converge to a final network structure after finite number of iterations . the converged network structure is the nash network in the space of feasible strategies @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "* initial state * + the starting network is a star network in which each source td is connected directly to the nearest bs .",

    "the best response strategy of a relay td is to respond to the proposal , either acceptance or rejection .",
    "a link replacement operation is executed if the relay td is involved in a link .",
    "that is , the relay td splits from its current connected td and replaces it with a new td that maximizes its payoff . * until * converge to the nash network structure @xmath112 . *",
    "phase 2 * _ feedback _ each td @xmath6 sends the information about the link @xmath113 back to its sp for a coalition formation decision . * until * acceptance of the convergent network graph by all the sps which perform * algorithm 1 * , i.e. , merge - and - split operation of * algorithm 1 * converges . *",

    "figure  [ roadmap ] shows a flowchart of the proposed layered coalitional game which interrelates * algorithm 1 * and * algorithm 2*. the layered coalitional game starts from the * initial state * and firstly goes to the _ discovery _ phase of * algorithm 1 * during which the sps inform their td their coalition sets . then , the algorithm calls the _ dynamic virtual link replacement _ and _ feedback _ phases of * algorithm 2 * which provide a convergent network structure according to the initial coalitional structure of sps . after this , one sp begins to perform overlapping coalition formation with another sp . also , the sp pair attempting to make cooperation informs their tds to execute the dynamic virtual link replacement and the tds provide feedback to the sp pair subsequently .",
    "this process is repeated until the merge - and - split operation converges .",
    "finally , the algorithm goes to _ cooperative sharing _",
    "phase where the sps share their vacant tds with cooperative sps and all the tds perform multi - hop transmission according to the final convergent network structure .",
    "the proposed layered coalitional game can be implemented in a distributed way for wrns .",
    "the decision of each sp can be made by an sp controller ( a td can also be delegated as sp controller in practice ) , while each td is responsible for its best response action .",
    "for the coalition formation of sps , each sp controller can communicate with its counterparts and its tds through wired or wireless communication depending on the network infrastructure . for link formation , each vacant td can broadcast its information to its neighboring tds .",
    "as the link formation algorithm is run periodically , the period between each algorithm run should be determined considering the network environment dynamics on a case - by - case basis .",
    "in the proposed layered coalitional game , any reasonable bases for allocating the aggregated utility need to stabilize the overlapping coalitions . in other words ,",
    "the allocated utility should be imperative to motivate the sps to join the coalitions which maximize the aggregated utility .",

    "the marginal contribution of sp @xmath3 to a set @xmath116 is defined as follows : @xmath117 the shapley value for sp @xmath3 in coalition @xmath8 can be obtained from @xmath118    the shapley value is suitable for the utility allocation in sp coalitional game due to the properties of efficiency , individual fairness and uniqueness .",
    "the efficiency means that the sum of the allocated utility for all sps equals the maximum aggregated utility , i.e. , @xmath119 . for individual fairness ,",
    "shapley value guarantees the allocated utility of each sp to be larger than or equal to the value of the individual sp , i.e. , @xmath120 , for all @xmath121 .",
    "uniqueness means that there is only a single result derived by shapley value solution .",

    "connects to td@xmath153 to improve the total payoff of the wrn .",
    "since td@xmath157 has no other option for relaying , it has to perform the direct transmission to the bs .",
    "similarly , td@xmath162 disconnects from td@xmath163 and connects with td@xmath154 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , although td@xmath154 locates in the left side of the area , it chooses the right bs for the uplink transmission . as the tds are throughput - oriented , the proposed algorithm can help the td to find the optimal bs to maximize the end - to - end throughput . moreover , the proposed algorithm enables td@xmath155 to find the optimal relay , i.e. , td@xmath164 , among several possible relay options , e.g. , td@xmath165 , td@xmath164 and td@xmath166 , to maximize the throughput of td@xmath155 . in the proposed algorithm",
    ", it only takes one iteration for tds to form the new network structure adapting to the traffic demand change .",
    "we can observe that the corresponding coalitional structure remains intact , i.e. , the grand coalition @xmath167 .",
    "table  [ cc5 ] shows the results from the utility allocation solution under different coalitional structures .",
    "as expected , the grand coalition , i.e. , @xmath167 , resulting from the layered coalitional game is stable .",
    "moreover , as we can observe , the grand coalition is the only stable coalition structure .",
    "the grand coalition is stable because none of the three sps can improve its utility by breaking the cooperation with any others .",
    "@xmath168 is not stable because any two of the sps can cooperate to gain higher individual utility . @xmath169 and @xmath170 are not stable since by transiting to @xmath171 any one of the sps is able to gain higher utility .",
    "@xmath172 is not stable because @xmath150 can establish coalition with either @xmath149 or @xmath151 to form @xmath173 or @xmath174 , respectively , to improve its utility .",
    "@xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath171 are not stable because the two non - cooperative sps in these coalitional structures can both gain higher individual utility by cooperation , transiting the coalitional structure to @xmath167 .",
    "when the coalition cost is varied , the current coalitional structure may not always be stable and yield the maximum aggregated utility .",
    "sps are free to form any stable coalitional structures that are beneficial to them .",
    "specifically , we look into the details of cases with coalition cost @xmath175 and @xmath176 as shown in tables  [ cc15 ] and  [ cc35 ] , respectively . in the case with @xmath175 , there are two stable coalitional structures , i.e. , @xmath170 and @xmath172 , under the utility allocation solution .",
    "they are stable because none of the sps can unilaterally improve its utility by splitting from its current coalition(s ) or joining new coalition(s ) .",
    "the final stable coalitional structure depends on the initial coalitional structure and the sequence of the coalition formation among the sps . taking the case of @xmath175 for example",
    ", we illustrate the transition diagram of three sps in fig .",
    "[ cost15 ] .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath173 , then @xmath172 is the only coalitional structure that can be reached when the merge - and - split updating rule is applied .",
    "however , if the initial state is @xmath174 , either @xmath170 or @xmath172 could be reached depending on which sp , either @xmath149 or @xmath150 , will break cooperation with @xmath151 first .",
    "similarly , the final coalitional structure resulting from other initial coalitional structures can be found following the same analysis . in the case of @xmath176",
    ", we can observe that there is only one stable coalitional structure , i.e. , @xmath168 .",
    "as none of sps can benefit from forming any coalitional structure due to the high coalition cost , each sp tends to operate without cooperation . with the above analysis",
    ", we can observe that the utility allocation solution can help each sp to determine the fair utility share under different possible coalitional structures . with these allocation results ,",
    "the rational sps can make decisions to form stable coalitional structures for the purpose of utility improvement .",
    "the layered cooperation in the wireless relay network ( wrn ) leads to the improved network capacity for the terminal devices ( tds ) and higher benefit for the service providers ( sps ) . in this paper",
    ", we have presented a game theoretic framework for sp and td cooperation .",
    "specifically , we have proposed a layered coalitional game to model the cooperation behavior among the sps and tds in the wrn .",
    "the overlapping coalition formation game has been proposed for sps to find the stable coalitional structures , while the network structure formation game has been introduced for tds to form the stable network structures .",
    "we have shown the convergence of the algorithm at both layers .",
    "this paper has also addressed the utility allocation problem of cooperative sps in the wrn by adopting the concepts of shapley value .",
