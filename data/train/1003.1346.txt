    "mev , maid2007 tends to systematically underestimate the forward region and to overestimate the backward region because ( precise ) data have been missing .",
    "our new results presented here and the recent leps data , which cover the backward region  @xcite , will , thus , be useful to constrain future model solutions and partial wave analyses .",
    "although it will be possible to modify the model solutions to better describe the data , double - polarization observables are needed to unambiguously extract the scattering amplitude .",
    "to summarize , we have presented the results of a reanalysis of previously published cbelsa / taps data and new measurements of the beam asymmetry @xmath0 for the photoproduced @xmath17 final state .",
