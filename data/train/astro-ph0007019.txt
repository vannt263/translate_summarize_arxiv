    "although the standard cosmological model has been succesful in explaining the homogenous expansion of the universe and the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background radiation , it has some shortcomings like the initial singularity , horizon ( or causality ) , flatness , homogeneity and isotropy problems.@xcite among these problems the initial singularity problem may be the one which weakens the model much more than the others , in the sense that it causes infinities in the physical quantities such as the density , pressure and temperature . since these infinities can not be accepted by any model which claims to be physical , during the past two decades , several authors have considered the possibility of describing the universe with a singularity - free cosmological model . @xcite    recent observations point out that the universe has an @xmath7 , @xmath8 value lower than unity which means that the universe is spatially open .",
    "@xcite in the light of these , we propose an open singularity - free cosmological model with the same motivations as in ref .",
    "however , initially static condition @xmath9 used by the closed universe models can no longer be used in the open universe case since it leads to negative energy densities . for this reason in our model universe",
    "starts expanding with an initial velocity .",
    "hence , we have a two - parameter universe model in which one of the parameters characterizes the equation of state used to describe the prematter era , and the other one corresponds to the initial expansion rate of the universe .",
    "our model describes an open , spatially homogenous and isotropic universe with a space - time geometry given by the robertson - walker ( rw ) line element :    @xmath10 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath11 are the comoving coordinates , @xmath12 is the scale factor which represents the size of the universe .   for the rw metric , einstein field equations lead us to the following differential equations : @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy density and pressure in the universe respectively , where we have used perfect fluid energy momentum tensor in comoving coordinates .",
    "here a dot denotes differentiation with  respect to the cosmic time @xmath17 and we use the units so that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the planck mass . combining eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) and using an equation of state given as @xmath20 one obtains the following relation :    @xmath21    where , @xmath22 is assumed to be a constant parameter during each era in the history of the universe .",
    "we can eliminate @xmath15 between eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 5 ) and obtain an equation involving only the scale factor @xmath12 :    @xmath23    to solve this equation for any @xmath22 , it is advantageous to work in conformal time @xmath24 which is defined as    @xmath25    using this transformation , eq .",

    "these solutions correspond to different signs of the energy density @xmath31 . assuming that the universe is filled with positive energy , we eliminate eq .",
    "( 9 ) and consider only eq .",
    "( 8) as the solution for the scale factor of the universe . in this work , we model the universe as a series of perfect fluid eras connected by first order phase transitions .",
    "according to the considerations of this scenario , the universe starts expanding with a period of rapid expansion called inflationary era .",
    "this period is characterized by an equation of state in the form @xmath32 and inflation arises due to this vacuum - like characteristic of the equation of state .",
    "since matter would be under extreme conditions during this period and behaves very differently from the ordinary matter , it is called `` prematter '' .",
    "@xcite during this period due to the unusual characteristic of the equation of state , temperature increases although the universe expands enormously .",
    "we assume that inflation continues until the temperature reaches the maximum allowed temperature i.e. the planck temperature @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "this behavior , which does not necessitate a `` re - heating mechanism '' as in the other models of the universe , follows from the vacuum like characteristic of the equation of state used to describe the universe in this era .",
    "initially , we assume that the universe is in a vacuum - like state and has a limiting density called the planck density @xmath35 which is first formulated by markov as a universal law of nature .",
    "@xcite since our model describes a universe starting from a finite size and density , the initial expansion rate must be taken as positive .",
    "hence we take the initial expansion rate as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is some positive constant .",
    "solutions for the scale factor in different eras are:@xmath38^{1/c_{p}}\\   & \\ \\ 0\\leq",

    "m _ denote the prematter , radiation and matter eras respectively .",
    "we next impose the boundary condition that the scale factor and its derivative are continuous at points @xmath39 and @xmath40 where the phase transitions take place .",

    "the parameters are the @xmath47 value and the initial value of the hubble constant @xmath48 .",
    "the former determines the amount of inflation that the universe has experienced during the prematter era and the latter is related to the initial expansion rate of the universe",

    "choosing @xmath71 we obtain respectively @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74",
    "in order to see this dependence and the development of the universe in this model , we changed one of the parameters while fixing the other and provided some numerical results .",
    "this allowed us to identify the character of the dependency of the model to each parameter .",
    "first , we fix @xmath75 to @xmath76 @xmath77 , and changed @xmath2 in such a way that it took values between @xmath78 and @xmath79 it is to be noted that in this broad range , the value of hubble constant has a wide spectrum between @xmath80 @xmath77 and @xmath81 @xmath82 next , we set @xmath2 to @xmath83 and varied @xmath75 in the range between @xmath84 @xmath77 and @xmath85 @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding values for the hubble constant vary between @xmath86 @xmath77 and @xmath87 @xmath82",
    "we construct an open singularity - free cosmological model with the assumptions that the universe is initially in a vacuum like state and the physical quantities are limited by their planck values .",
    "evolution of the temperature of the universe is governed by its expansion . during the prematter era ,",
    "temperature increases due to inflation and the universe is characterized by a vacuum like equation of state in the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a parameter which determines the vacuum dominance of the early universe .",
    "hence , the model we construct is a two - parameter universe model , the parameters being @xmath75 and @xmath90 .",
    "this era ends when the temperature reaches the maximum allowed temperature @xmath91 then the universe enters the radiation era and starts cooling down .",
    "this cooling continues during the matter era described by the standard model .",
    "the so - called flatness problem is not present in this model since the initial value of @xmath92 is not set to unity . in the standard model ,",
    "such a precise initial condition has to be assumed without explanation to produce a universe resembling the actual one . in this model ,",
    "the universe starts its journey with an @xmath92 value no matter how close to unity and during the prematter era @xmath92 is driven toward unity . at the end of this era ,",
    "the universe is nearly flat since its @xmath92 value is very close to one .",
    "this fact could be attributed to the inflation mechanism which causes the universe to expand enormously in a very small time interval ( planck time ) and thus become flatter than at the beginning . during the radiation and matter eras , @xmath92 is driven away unity which apparently displays the open character of the space - time geometry of the model .    in this work ,",
    "we have not been interested in the microphysics of the inflationary era .",
    "this includes quantum mechanical investigation of the material content of the early universe and the form of the scalar field potential responsible for the inflation .",
    "however , with this simple form , the scenario proposed in this work might provide a guidance for the future more complete versions of the open inflation ."
