    "the @xmath0 ising model is a simplified model @xcite for disordered uniaxial magnetic systems showing glassy behavior in some region of their phase diagram and represents an interesting theoretical laboratory to study the effects of quenched disorder and frustration .",
    "it is defined by the lattice hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the sum is over the nearest - neighbor sites of a simple cubic lattice , and the exchange interactions @xmath5 are uncorrelated quenched random variables , taking values @xmath0 with probability distribution @xmath6 in the following we set @xmath7 without loss of generality . for @xmath2 ,",
    "we recover the standard ising model , while for @xmath8 , we obtain the usual bimodal ising spin - glass model . the phase diagram in two and three dimensions",
    "is sketched in figure [ phase ] ; it is symmetric for @xmath9 and thus here and in the following we only consider the case @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .    in both @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the model exhibits a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic ( pf ) phase transition in the region of low frustration .",
    "the pf transition line starts at the ising point @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the critical temperature of the ising model , and extends up to the multicritical nishimori point ( mnp ) at @xmath16 . along this line ,",
    "the critical behavior is analogous to that observed in randomly dilute ising ( rdi ) models .    in two dimensions , renormalization - group ( rg ) and conformal field theory predict @xcite that disorder is marginally irrelevant , thus the critical behavior is controlled by the pure ising fixed point , with universal logarithmic corrections @xcite . in three dimensions disorder is relevant and the model shows a second - order phase transition in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) rdi universality class @xcite , which describes transitions in generic diluted ising systems with ferromagnetic exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the mnp is located along the so - called nishimori line ( @xmath17 line )  @xcite defined by the equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 . at the mnp",
    "the transition line is predicted to be parallel to the @xmath20 axis @xcite .",
    "then , it reaches the @xmath21 axis at @xmath22 .",
    "it has been proved @xcite that ferromagnetism can only exist in the region @xmath23 ; thus , @xmath24 must satisfy the inequality @xmath25 .",
    "recent numerical works indicate that @xmath24 is strictly larger than @xmath26 , though deviations are quite small , both in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions , as well as in related models @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior for @xmath27 depends on the dimension .",
    "the 3d @xmath0 model exhibits a paramagnetic - glassy ( pg ) transition line , which extends from the mnp up to @xmath8 . on this transition line ,",
    "the critical behavior is independent on @xmath28 and belongs to the ising spin - glass universality class @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in two dimensions there is no evidence of a finite - temperature glassy phase .",
    "glassy behavior is only expected for @xmath21 and @xmath29 : the glassy phase at @xmath21 is unstable with respect to thermal fluctuations .     ising model in the @xmath20-@xmath28 plane , in dimensions @xmath12 ( left ) and @xmath13 ( right ) . ]",
    "we present here the strategy used to analyze the critical behavior on the pf transition line in the 3d @xmath0 model .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case is analyzed in @xcite .    according to the renormalization group ( rg ) , in the case of periodic boundary conditions and for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the lattice size , a generic rg invariant quantity @xmath32 at the critical temperature @xmath33 behaves as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the universal infinite - volume limit and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the leading and next - to - leading correction - to - scaling exponents . in 3d rdi systems scaling corrections play an important role , since @xmath36 is quite small ; indeed , we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite . instead of computing the various quantities at fixed hamiltonian parameters , we keep a rg invariant quantity @xmath32 fixed at a given value @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this means that , for each @xmath31 , we determine the pseudocritical inverse temperature @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "all interesting thermodynamic quantities are then computed at @xmath43 .",
    "the pseudocritical inverse temperature @xmath41 converges to @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "the value @xmath40 can be specified at will , as long as @xmath46 is taken between the high- and low - temperature fixed - point values of @xmath32 . the choice @xmath47 ( where @xmath35 is the critical - point value ) improves the convergence of @xmath48 to @xmath44 for @xmath49 ; indeed @xmath50 for generic values of @xmath46 , while @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "we can then consider any other rg invariant quantity @xmath53 at fixed @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath45 , one can show that @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the derivative of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the susceptibility at fixed @xmath54 .",
    "more details on this method can be found in @xcite .      in the absence of external fields , the critical behavior at the mnp",
    "is characterized by two relevant rg operators .",
    "the singular part of the disorder - averaged free energy in a volume @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the corresponding scaling fields , @xmath67 at the mnp .",
    "the scaling fields @xmath66 are analytic functions of the model parameters @xmath20 and @xmath28 . using symmetry arguments",
    ", @xcite showed that the scaling axis corresponding to @xmath68 is along the @xmath17 line , so that @xmath69 . as for the scaling axis @xmath70 , @xmath71 expansion calculations predict it @xcite to be parallel to the @xmath20 axis .",
    "the extension of this result to lower dimensions suggests @xmath72 .",
    "note that , if this conjecture holds , only the scaling field @xmath73 depends on the temperature @xmath20 .",
    "these results give rise to the following predictions for the fss behavior around @xmath74 , @xmath26 . along the @xmath17 line , an rg invariant quantity @xmath32 has the following behavior for @xmath75 : @xmath76 where the subscript @xmath17 indicates that @xmath32 is restricted to the @xmath17 line and we have neglected scaling corrections .",
    "its derivative @xmath77 with respect to @xmath59 behaves as @xmath78 where the last equivalence holds only if @xmath79 does not depend on the temperature .",
    "this result gives us a method to verify the conjecture of @xcite : once @xmath80 has been determined from the scaling behavior of a rg invariant quantity @xmath32 close to the mnp , it is enough to check the scaling behavior of @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath77 scales as @xmath81 with @xmath82 , the conjecture is confirmed and @xmath83 . finally , along the @xmath17 line",
    "the susceptibility @xmath84 is expected to behave as @xmath85",
    "in @xcite we perform mc simulations of hamiltonian ( [ lh ] ) at @xmath13 close to the pf transition line . using the method outlined in sec .",
    "[ fss.lowf ] , we fit the large-@xmath31 limit of various rg - invariant quantities at fixed @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the correlation length ; this value is very close to the fixed - point value @xmath88 @xcite at @xmath44 .",
    "our fss analysis provides strong evidence that the critical behavior of the 3d @xmath0 ising model along the pf line belongs to the 3d rdi universality class .",
    "indeed , all the rg - invariant quantities considered are in agreement with the results reported in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 , in good agreement with the presently most accurate estimates @xcite @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the 3d rdi universality class .",
    "we also note that the random - exchange interaction in the @xmath0 ising model gives rise to frustration , while the rdi universality class describes transitions in generic diluted ising systems with ferromagnetic exchange interactions .",
    "therefore , our results imply that frustration is irrelevant along the pf transition line .",
    "moreover , the observed scaling corrections are consistent with the rdi correction - to - scaling exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "thus , frustration does not introduce new irrelevant perturbations with rg dimension @xmath93 .      in @xcite",
    ", we perform mc simulations of hamiltonian ( [ lh ] ) at @xmath12 , @xmath94 , along the @xmath17 line defined by ( [ nline ] ) . in both cases , the position of the mnp as well as the rg dimension @xmath80 of the leading relevant operator @xmath79 are determined by fitting several rg - invariant quantities @xmath32 to ( [ rginvsca ] ) ( in the 2d case we also consider scaling corrections ) .",
    "we verify the conjecture that @xmath79 does not depend on @xmath20 and compute the rg dimension associated with @xmath79 and @xmath73 .    for the 2d model ,",
    "the mnp is located at @xmath95 , @xmath96 , the rg dimensions of the operators that control the multicritical behavior are @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the susceptibility exponent is @xmath99 . in three dimensions ,",
    "we find @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
