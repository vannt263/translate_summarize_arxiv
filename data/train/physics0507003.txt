    "<S> technically , the effect can be reduced by very thick electrodes or implementation of trapping layers @xcite . furthermore , we observed an indication of incomplete thermalization and partial phonon escape from the absorber . </S>",

    "<S> improvements are expected from deposition of the detector on a membrane @xcite or fabrication of a fully suspended absorber bridge with small junction areas . </S>"
