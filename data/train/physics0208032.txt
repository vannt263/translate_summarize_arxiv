    "zero - frequency linear eigenmodes are zonal flows and form a slow manifold . in the absence of the @xmath0 term , the model reduces to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) , incompressible navier stokes equations .",

    "energy is transferred anisotropically to large - scale zonal flows with @xmath52 .",
