    "therefore , a w1 waveguide brought into close proximity to the cavity along the x - axis will couple well to the x - dipole but poorly to the y - dipole .",
    "the same selection principle holds for coupling along the y - axis , except the phc lattice symmetry forbids a w1 waveguide along this axis . in this case , a waveguide at 30@xmath12 to the vertical can be employed however , such that the waveguide terminates on a line along the y - axis that passes through the cavity center as shown in fig.[coup_eff_calc](a ) .",
    "along this line , the waveguide field overlap remains high for the y - dipole and low for the x - dipole mode .",
    "it should be noted that although the cavity modes also exhibit significant penetration depths at 45@xmath12 to the mode axis , these are common to both modes and are therefore unsuitable for selective coupling .      for optimal device operation",

    "the exceptions of n~y~=5 and 7 for the y - dipole are due to the path taken when adjusting the cavity - waveguide separation , resulting in the waveguide moving in and out of the evanescent tail .",
    "the mechanism is different for the x - dipole at n~x~=5 , since the cavity and waveguide modes share the same axis : this phenomenon is attributed to fluctuations in the overlap integral of the two modes @xcite .",

    "the additional peaks observed at longer wavelengths ( 947.4 nm for c / o~h~ and 946.2 nm for c / o~v~ ) are fabry - perot modes in the waveguides which are excited due to overlap with the cavity modes @xcite .",

    "the selective coupling behavior is maintained and the cavity modes are excited with comparable intensity to direct excitation of the cavity ( black curve ) . due to the spectral filtering by the cavity ,",
    "the fabry - perot modes in the waveguides are heavily suppressed in this geometry .",
    "measurements of uncoupled cavities yield typical q - factors @xmath292400 .",
    "these are much lower than the simulated q - factors , implying significant disorder losses in the photonic crystal , leading to large scattering losses .",
    "equation [ coup_eff_eq ] implies comparable coupling efficiencies of 36% & 37% for the x and y - dipole modes respectively .",
    "these are much lower than the expected value of 89% due to the large scattering loss rate of the cavities dominating over in - plane coupling rates in determining the total q factor : this results in a small change in the q - factor when the waveguides are introduced .",
    "further improvements to fabrication are expected to improve the device efficiency by reducing these scattering losses , increasing the q - factor of the uncoupled cavity .",
    "the lifted degeneracy and low coupling efficiency of this cavity precludes its use as a spin - photon interface .",
    "however , since the coupling selection mechanisms rely upon spatial and not spectral discrimination , the selective coupling behavior of the cavity is maintained .",
    "although some cross talk is observed , the background - subtracted contrast ratio ( @xmath30 for o~v~ and @xmath31 for o~h~ ) is sufficiently high to distinguish between the two .",
    "we believe the overlap of the fp mode in the y - waveguide is responsible for the reduced contrast ratio , since the overlap region encompasses the x - dipole mode : when subtracted from the spectrum , this value increases to @xmath32 .",
    "whilst unsuitable as a spin - photon interface , the non - degenerate cavity may be suitable for electro - optic switching applications .",
    "with application of a time - varying electric field @xcite to a single qd at the cavity center , the emission wavelength can be tuned from resonance with one mode to another via the quantum confined stark effect .",
    "the emission rate into one mode is enhanced whilst the orthogonal component is suppressed @xcite and the qd emission should be switched between the two waveguides on the timescale of the electric field modulation period .      amongst the range of cavity mode splittings produced during fabrication , there are cavities which exhibit a mode splitting that is on the order of , or less than , the cavity mode linewidth .",
    "pl measurements on such a cavity are shown in fig . [",
    "degen_spectra](a ) .",
    "the c / c configuration shows a single spectral feature centerd at 935.2 nm .",
    "polarization measurements show this is comprised of two orthogonal modes as shown in fig .",

    "the q - factors of the x(y)-dipole modes are 1600(1200 ) , with corresponding coupling efficiencies of 37(48)% .",
    "this small splitting is reflected in the spectral measurements in fig .",
    "[ degen_spectra](b ) for the c / o~h~ and c / o~v~ configuration . to assess the cross - talk , one outcoupler was excited whilst collecting from the other ( ( o~h~/o~v~ and o~v~/o~h~ ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ degen_spectra](b ) : as can be seen from the data , the cross - talk is comparable to the background signal at @xmath2820% of the peak intensity .        from these measurements , we conclude that this near - degenerate cavity also exhibits selective coupling of the orthogonal dipole modes to two separate waveguides , since the observed cross - talk is very low .",
    "although this device also suffers from relatively low coupling efficiency , the q factors remain sufficiently high to provide a high degree of spontaneous emission enhancement @xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane emission of a single qd positioned at the cavity center which is spectrally resonant with the cavity modes would be unpolarized if orientated with the cavity modes , since it would couple to both dipole modes .",
    "we have demonstrated that these cavity modes couple to separate waveguides and hence only the corresponding orthogonally polarized components of the qd emission should be present in the waveguides ; likewise , excitation via the waveguides will only couple the principle polarization components to the qd .",
    "this is similar to the result in @xcite , with the possibility of spontaneous emission enhancement of the qd to produce indistinguishable single photons .",
    "we have presented designs of an unpolarized photonic crystal cavity which exhibits selective coupling of the two orthogonally polarized dipole modes of an h1 cavity to two separate waveguides .",
    "using fdtd simulations , the cavity - waveguide separation was optimized for equal coupling efficiencies of 89% , coupled q - factors exceeding 2000 and the waveguide dispersion adjusted to reduce propagation losses of the coupled cavity emission .",
    "the selective coupling of the orthogonal dipole modes was experimentally demonstrated for a device with non - zero splitting of the cavity modes and for a device with a small splitting to linewidth ratio .",
    "the former may offer functionality as an electro - optic switch ; the latter is expected to act as a spin - photon interface for a resonant qd positioned at the cavity center .",
    "this provides a one - to - one correspondence between the bloch sphere of the excitonic spin states of the qd and the poincar - like sphere of the cavity modes , encoding this information in a which - path regime .",
    "the device maintains selectivity when excited via either the cavity or the waveguides , such that several devices coupled together may realize a scalable quantum spin network , although single qd measurements remain to fully confirm these predictions ."
