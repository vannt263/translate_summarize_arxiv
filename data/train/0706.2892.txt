    "the voter model @xcite is one of the simplest examples of cooperative behavior that has been used as a paradigm for the dynamics of opinions in socially interacting populations . in the voter model ,",
    "each node of a graph is occupied by a voter that has two opinion states , denoted as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "opinions evolve by : ( i ) picking a random voter ; ( ii ) the selected voter adopts the state of a randomly - chosen neighbor ; ( iii ) repeat these steps _ ad infinitum _ or until a finite system necessarily reaches consensus .",
    "naively , one can view each voter has having no self confidence and thus takes on the state of one of its neighbors .",
    "this evolution resembles that of the ising model with zero - temperature glauber kinetics @xcite , but with one important difference : in the ising model , each spin obeys the state of the local majority ; in the voter model , a voter chooses a state with a probability that is proportional to the number of neighbors in that state .",
    "there are three basic properties of the voter model that characterize its evolution .",
    "the first is the exit probability , namely , the probability that a finite system eventually reaches consensus where all voters are in the + state , @xmath4 , as a function of the initial density @xmath5 of + voters . because the mean magnetization , defined as the difference in the fraction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 voters ( averaged over all realizations and histories ) , is conserved on any degree - regular graph , and because the only possible final states of a finite system are consensus , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a second basic property is the mean time @xmath7 to reach consensus in a finite system of @xmath8 voters . for regular lattices in @xmath9 dimensions",
    ", it is known that @xmath7 scales as @xmath10 in @xmath11 , as @xmath12 in @xmath13 , and as @xmath8 in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath7 generally scales sublinearly with @xmath8 on heterogeneous graphs with broad degree distributions @xcite . defining @xmath15 as the @xmath16 moment of the degree distribution , then @xmath17 , which grows slower than linearly in @xmath8 for a sufficiently broad degree distribution .",
    "finally , the 2-point correlation function @xmath18 , defined as the probability that 2 voters a distance @xmath19 apart are in the same state , asymptotically decays as @xmath20 on a regular lattice when the spatial dimension @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this decay is the same as that of the electrostatic potential of a point charge , a correspondence that has proven useful in analyzing the voter model .    in this work",
    ", we investigate an extension of the voter model in which a small fraction of the population are zealots  individuals that never change opinion .",
    "the effect of a single zealot @xcite or a small number of zealots @xcite on primarily static properties of the voter model has been studied previously , and considerable insight has been gained by exploiting the previously - mentioned electrostatic correspondence .",
    "the role of zealots has also been investigated in a majority rule opinion dynamics model @xcite , where again equal densities of zealots of each type prevent consensus from being achieved .",
    "one motivation for our work is the obvious fact that consensus is not the asymptotic outcome of repeated elections in democratic societies .",
    "one such example is the set of us presidential elections @xcite , where the percentage of votes for the winner has ranged from highs of 61.05% ( johnson over goldwater 1964 ) and 60.80% ( roosevelt over landon 1932 ) to lows of 47.80% ( harrison minority winner over cleveland 1888 ) and 47.92% ( hayes over tilden 1876 ) . in this compilation ,",
    "we exclude elections with substantial voting to candidates outside the top two ( fig .",
    "[ mt ] ) .",
    "( black ) , 16 ( red ) , and 128 zealots ( blue ) . data were smoothed over a 1% range .",
    "also shown are u.s .",
    "presidential election results ( circles ) from 18762004 ( corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively ) where the magnetization is defined as the difference in the vote fraction of the top 2 candidates.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "this example , as well as election results from many democratic countries , show in an obvious way that consensus will never be achieved in large voting populations .",
    "this fact motivates us to to investigate an opinion dynamics model in which consensus is stymied by the presence of zealots . because of the competing influences of the zealots and the tendency toward consensus by the voter dynamics , the magnetization fluctuates with time in a manner that can be made to qualitatively mimic , for example , the u.s .",
    "presidential election results ( fig .  [ mt ] ) . upon averaging over a long time period , these time - dependent fluctuations",
    "lead to a stationary magnetization distribution whose properties are the main focus of this work .",
    "the basic question that we wish to address in the voter model with a subpopulation of zealots is : what is the nature of the global opinion as a function of the density of zealots ?",
    "one of our main results is that equal but very small numbers of zealots of both types leads to a steady state with a narrow gaussian magnetization distribution centered at zero . here",
    "the magnetization is simply the difference in the fraction of voters of each species .",
    "thus a small fraction of zealots is surprisingly effective in maintaining a steady state with only small fluctuations about this state .",
    "it should also be mentioned that there are a variety of simple and prototypical opinion dynamics models , in which lack of consensus is a basic outcome , including the multiple - state axelrod model @xcite , the bounded compromise model of weisbuch et al .",
    "@xcite and its variants @xcite . for these models ,",
    "the consensus preventing feature typically is the absence of interaction whenever two agents become sufficiently incompatible . as a function of basic model parameters ,",
    "the fraction of incompatible agents can grow , leading to cultural fragmentation and an attendant steady or static opinion state .    in the next section ,",
    "we define the model .",
    "then in secs .",
    "[ sec : cg ] and [ sec:1d ] , we solve the model in the mean - field limit and on a one - dimensional periodic ring .",
    "we then investigate the behavior on the square lattice by numerical simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] and find behavior that is quantitatively close to that in the mean - field limit .",
    "finally , we conclude and point out some additional interesting features of the role of zealotry on the voter model in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the population consists of @xmath8 voters , with a fixed number of zealots that never change opinion , while the remaining voters are susceptible to opinion change .",
    "each voter can be in one of two opinion states , @xmath23 or @xmath24 that we term `` democrat '' and `` republican '' , respectively .",
    "thus the system consists of @xmath25 democrat and @xmath26 republican zealots , as well as @xmath27 democrat and @xmath28 republican susceptibles .",
    "each type of voter evolves as follows :    1 .   _",
    "susceptible democrats _ can become republicans ; 2 .",
    "_ susceptible republicans _ can become democrats ; 3 .",
    "_ zealot democrats _ are always democrats ; 4 .   _ zealot republicans _ are always republicans .    each agent , whether a zealot or a susceptible , has the same persuasion strength that we set to @xmath29 .",
    "that is , after a susceptible voter selects a neighbor , the voter is persuaded to adopt the state of this neighbor with probability 1 . because the total population comprises of agents in one of four possible states , we have @xmath30 . since the number of zealots is fixed , the total number of susceptible individuals @xmath31 is also conserved .",
    "the dynamics is a direct generalization of voter model and consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "pick a random voter , if this voter is a zealot nothing happens .",
    "2 .   if the selected voter is a susceptible , then pick a random neighbor and adopt its state ; note that if the selected voter and the neighbor are in the same state , nothing happens in the update .",
    "repeat steps 1 & 2 _ ad infinitum _ or until consensus is reached .",
    "we will investigate this model on the two natural geometries of the complete graph , a natural realization of the mean - field limit , and regular lattices .",
    "for the complete graph , all other voters in the system are nearest - neighbor to any voter .",
    "thus the complete graph has no spatial structure , a feature that allows for a simple solution .",
    "in contrast , when the voters live on the sites of a regular lattice , a voter can be directly influenced only by its the nearest neighbors .",
    "on the complete graph , the state of the population may be characterized by the probability @xmath32 of finding @xmath33 susceptible voters at time @xmath34 . since @xmath35",
    ", we merely need to consider the master equation for @xmath36 , which reads @xmath37 the first term accounts for processes in which the number of susceptible democrats after the event equals @xmath27 , while the second term accounts for the complementary loss processes where @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 represents the rate at which transitions occur and is given by @xmath40 the first line is the probability of choosing first a republican susceptible and then a democrat ( susceptible or zealot ) , for which a susceptible republican converts to a susceptible democrat in the voter model interaction .",
    "we choose @xmath41 , so that , on average , each agent is selected once at each time step .      the first term on the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "correspondingly , the magnetization @xmath54 attains the steady - state value @xmath55 . when the number of agents is finite , however , finite - size fluctuations arise from the diffusive second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) .",
    "this term leads to a steady - state probability distribution with a finite width that is centered at @xmath56 . in what follows ,",
    "we examine these fluctuations around the mean - field steady state when @xmath8 and @xmath57 are both finite .      according to the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe ] ) , the stationary distribution @xmath58 obeys @xmath59=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose formal solution is @xmath60 since the density @xmath48 of agents in the state @xmath23 ranges from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , the normalization constant @xmath63 is obtained by requiring @xmath64 .",
    "this condition gives @xmath65^{-1}.\\ ] ]    we are particularly interested in the distribution of the magnetization @xmath66 in the continuum limit , which directly follows from ( [ pstat ] ) through a simple change of variables .",
    "we first consider the system with the same number of zealots of each type , and then the asymmetric system with unequal numbers of zealots of each type .",
    "when the number of zealots of each species is equal , we write @xmath68 . the rate equation ( [ mf ] ) then gives an equal steady - state density of democrats and republicans , @xmath69 , corresponding to zero average magnetization , @xmath70 .",
    "we now compute the stationary distribution of magnetization by accounting for finite - size fluctuations .",

    "the inset shows the scaled form of these distributions for @xmath73 ; the case @xmath74 slightly deviates from the rest of the distributions that become visually coincident.,scaledwidth=42.5% ]    to perform the integral in eq .  , it is helpful to transform from @xmath48 to the magnetization @xmath75 which lies in @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "we therefore find @xmath77 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ pstat ] ) , this leads to the following stationary distribution of susceptible democrats : @xmath78 using the fact that @xmath79 , we readily obtain the stationary magnetization distribution : @xmath80 in the limit of large @xmath1 , we may then approximate the distribution by the gaussian @xmath81 , with @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "when zealots are present in equal numbers , the magnetization distribution quickly approaches a symmetric gaussian , with a width that is inversely proportional to the square - root of the _ number _ of zealots and not the density .",

    "( [ pm ] ) .",

    "close to this peak value , there is little asymmetry ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath98 .",
    "additionally , for a large number of zealots we may approximate the distribution ( [ pm_2 ] ) by the gaussian @xmath99 $ ] , with @xmath100^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we now turn to the one - dimensional system , where the behavior of the classical voter model is quite different from that in the mean - field limit .",
    "when zealots are present , however , we generically obtain a gaussian magnetization distribution , as in the mean - field case .",
    "we now derive the magnetization distribution ",
    "first for two zealots  and then for an arbitrary number of zealots .",
    "suppose that two zealots of opposite opinion are randomly placed on a periodic ring of length @xmath101 .",
    "the ring is thus split into two independent segments of lengths @xmath102 and @xmath103 , with @xmath104 ( fig .  [ ring ] ) .",
    "we take the ring to be large so that we may write @xmath105 . as shown in fig .",

    "simulations is excellent .",
    "we now study the magnetization distribution when many zealots are randomly distributed on the ring , with the restriction of equal numbers of each type of zealot ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "two distinct possibilities can arise :    1 .",
    "a segment of consecutive susceptible voters is surrounded by two zealots of the same sign . with voter model dynamics ,",
    "these segments eventually align with the state of the confining zealots so that the segment freezes .",
    "a segment of consecutive susceptible voters is surrounded by two zealots of opposite opinion .",
    "eventually a single domain wall remains that diffuses freely within the segment .",
    "we first consider the simpler case where equal numbers of + and @xmath3 zealots are randomly but alternately placed around the ring so that no frozen segments arise .",
    "the segment lengths @xmath123 with @xmath124 , obey the constraint @xmath125 ( ignoring the space occupied by the zealots themselves ) .    to find the magnetization distribution , we map the state of the voters onto an equivalent random walk as follows . in a segment of length @xmath126 ,",
    "the difference in the number of @xmath2 and @xmath3 voters at long times is uniformly distributed in @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "we define this difference as the unnormalized magnetization @xmath128 .",
    "we now make the following approximations that apply when @xmath129 such that each @xmath126 is also large . in this limit",
    ", we may assume that each @xmath126 is independent and identically distributed . as a result ,",
    "the sum of the unnormalized magnetizations over all intervals is equivalent to the displacement of a random walk of @xmath1 steps with each step uniformly distributed in @xmath127 $ ] .    to solve this random walk problem",
    ", we use the basic fact that the fourier transform for the probability distribution of the entire walk @xmath130 is simply the product of the fourier transforms of the single - step distributions @xcite .",
    "since the fourier transform of a uniform single - step distribution over the range @xmath127 $ ] is @xmath131 , we then have @xmath132 since we are interested in the asymptotic limit where the unnormalized magnetization becomes large , we study the limit of @xmath130 for small @xmath133 .",
    "thus we expand each factor in @xmath130 in a taylor series to first order , and then re - exponentiate to yield @xmath134 we now invert this fourier transform to give the distribution of the unnormalized magnetization @xmath135 with @xmath136 .    what we want",
    ", however , is the magnetization distribution ; this is related to @xmath137 by @xmath138 .",
    "we thus find @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "if the number of intervals is large , then each @xmath126 is approximately @xmath141 , from which we obtain @xmath142 . ( the result @xmath143 is exact if all interval lengths are equal . )   as in the mean - field limit , the width of the magnetization distribution is controlled by the _ number _ of zealots and not their concentration , so that a small number of zealots is effective in maintaining the magnetization close to zero .",
    "a similar approach applies in the case where the spatial ordering of the zealots is uncorrelated . in this case , approximately one - half of all segments will be terminated by oppositely - oriented zealots and one - half by zealots of the same species . for the latter type of segments",
    ", the unnormalized magnetization will equal @xmath144 equiprobably .",
    "under the assumption that exactly one - half of the segments are frozen and one - half contain a single freely - diffusing domain wall , the analog of eq .   is @xmath145 the second product accounts for frozen segments in which the unnormalized magnetization equals @xmath144 equiprobably .",
    "for these segments the fourier transform of the single - step probability for a random walk whose steps length are @xmath144 equals @xmath146 . following the same steps that led to eq .  , we again obtain a gaussian magnetization distribution , but with @xmath147 given by @xmath148 .",
    "in the classical voter model , the two - dimensional system is at the critical dimension so that its behavior deviates from that of the mean - field system by logarithmic corrections . in the presence of zealots , however , the behaviors in two dimensions and in mean field are quite close , as illustrated in fig .",

    "after the system reaches the steady state , we measure steady - state properties at time intervals @xmath150 .",

    "the resulting data for the magnetization distribution is typically noisy , and we employ a gaussian averaging of nearby points to smooth the data . if @xmath152 denotes the @xmath153 magnetization value , then the smoothed magnetization distribution at @xmath152 is defined as @xmath154 where the sum includes the initial point , as well as the @xmath9 points to the left and to the right of the initial point , with @xmath9 typically in the range 2040 .",
    "such a smoothed distribution is the quantity that is actually plotted in figs .",
    "[ zmf ] , [ zmf - asymm ] , [ tsymm ] , and in the spatial averaged distribution in fig .  [ 2ddipole ] .",
    "we have shown that a small number of zealots in a population of voters is quite effective in maintaining a steady state in which consensus is never achieved . when there are equal numbers of zealots of each type , the steady - state fraction of democrats and republicans equals 1/2 ; equivalently , the magnetization equals zero . for unequal densities of the two types of zealots ,",
    "the steady - state magnetization is simply @xmath155 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the number of zealots of each type .",
    "the magnetization distribution is generically gaussian , @xmath156 , with @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the total number of zealots .",
    "a gaussian magnetization distribution arises universally in one dimension , on the square lattice ( two dimensions ) , and on the complete graph ( mean - field limit ) .",
    "one basic consequence of this distribution is that as the total number of voters @xmath8 increases , the fraction of zealots needed to keep the magnetization less than a specified level vanishes as @xmath159 .",
    "there are several additional aspects of the influence that zealots have on the voter model that are worth pointing out .",
    "although the time to reach consensus is infinite because this state can never be achieved , one can ask for the time until a specified plurality is first achieved .",
    "equivalently , we can ask for the probability that the magnetization first reaches a value @xmath108 , when the system is initialized with @xmath160 . from the above generic gaussian form of the magnetization distribution",
    ", we expect that the mean time for a symmetric system to first reach a magnetization @xmath108 will thus scale as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a constant of order one .",
    "thus one must wait an extremely long time before the system achieves even a modest deviation away from the zero - magnetization state when the number of zealots becomes appreciable .",

    ", scaledwidth=42.5% ]    another interesting feature is the role of the zealots spatial positions on the steady state .",
    "for example , if there are only two zealots that are adjacent , one might expect that the effect of this `` dipole '' would be weaker than that of two separated monopoles .",
    "this is precisely the effect that is is observed in fig .",
    "[ 2ddipole ] . when the two zealots are adjacent , their effects are substantially screened and the magnetization distribution is peaked near @xmath163 .",
    "that is , the voters show a preference for consensus in spite of the zealots . on the other hand , when the zealots are maximally separated",
    ", the magnetization distribution is close to the distribution that arises when averaging over possible positions of the two zealots .",
    "zealots are also quite effective in reducing the total number of opinion changes in the system .",
    "if the population is close to zero magnetization , each voter typically has equal numbers of neighbors of each type .",
    "if the voters are not strongly correlated , each voter would change its state at a rate that is approximately equal to 1/2 .",
    "however , simulations on the square lattice show that the flip rate of each susceptible voter is considerably smaller . for example",
    ", for 1000 voters with 10 zealots ( 5 of each type ) , the rate of opinion changes of the susceptibles is around 1/5 and this rate decreases as the density of zealots decreases .    finally , a slight embellishment of our model could apply to real voting patterns in a democracy with strong regional differences .",
    "here it is natural to partition a population into enclaves , with an imbalance of one type of zealot over the other in each enclave .",
    "such a spatial distribution would correspond to red ( republican ) and blue ( democrat ) states in the parlance of us electoral politics .",
    "it would be interesting to study if such an extension can actually account for election results .",
