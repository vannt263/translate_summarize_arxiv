    "in recent years proposals for quantum computation and spintronics have initiated search for semiconductor nonmagnetic bulk materials and heterostructures that might be used to realize high values of electron spin polarization , on the one hand , and its long storage time , on the other . at low temperatures ,",
    "this task is successfully realized by exploiting low spin - relaxation rates of charge carriers localized in semiconductor quantum wells or confined in self - organized quantum dots  @xcite . with increasing temperature up to room temperature",
    "the free carriers get delocalized and , in zinc - blende - lattice bulk semiconductors , their spin relaxation time drastically decreases to values of the order of 100ps or even less  @xcite which limits the electron spin polarization under continuous - wave ( cw ) photoexcitation to few percent  @xcite .",
    "the situation can be partially improved in strongly @xmath0-doped samples where the intense electron - electron collisions essentially suppress the dyakonov - perel mechanism of spin relaxation , as shown theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , see also a comprehensive review article by wu  @xcite    recent experimental studies of electron spin dynamics in gaasn alloys have revealed strong contradiction with the existing expectations : extremely high spin polarization , up to 90% , of the free electrons and its preservation during @xmath11ns have been found at room temperature in nonmagnetic undoped gaasn bulk films and gainasn quantum wells  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "electron spin polarization was created by optical pumping and detected by polarized photoluminescence ( pl ) .",
    "it has been established that the anomalously high polarization and spin memory arise due to spin - dependent recombination of free electrons with deep paramagnetic centers present in the nitrogen alloys and subsequent dynamic spin polarization of the centers  @xcite .",
    "the latter acts as a spin filter preventing the spin majority photoelectrons to recombine and promoting the spin minority photoelectrons to disappear from the conduction band . as a result",
    "the total density of photoelectrons increases superlinearly with the increasing pumping power which leads to an enhancement of the edge pl intensity ( up to a factor of 8)  @xcite as well as of room - temperature photoconductivity  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr )  @xcite and optical orientation of electron spins  @xcite have provided a proof that the paramagnetic centers in question are @xmath2 self - interstitial defects and established the critical dependence of the defect concentration on the n composition , ga(in)asn alloy growth conditions and post - growth treatment , e.g. , thermal annealing .",
    "the spin - dependent recombination ( sdr ) gives rise to formation of a coupled spin system of free and bound electrons where the free - electron polarization is intricately related to the spin state of paramagnetic centers . for the quantitative description of this coupled nonlinear system we proposed the sdr model  @xcite based on the model introduced by weisbuch and lampel  @xcite and used later by paget  @xcite in a qualitative analysis of low - temperature optical orientation of electron spins in gaalas and gaas , respectively .",
    "our model contains nine parameters . at present most of them",
    "have been found for gaasn experimentally .",
    "particularly , the measurements of cw and time - resolved polarized luminescence under circularly - polarized photoexcitation in the presence of a transverse magnetic field have allowed to estimate the spin - relaxation times of free and bound electrons , lifetime of photoholes , absolute value of free - electron @xmath3 factor and signs of the free- and bound - electron @xmath3-factors .",
    "the @xmath3 factor of bound electrons is determined from odmr studies  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic theoretical study of the sdr in the three- and two - charge - state models with a focus concentrated on the conduction photoelectron spin polarization and circular polarization of edge pl induced by circularly - polarized radiation .",
    "it is shown that the two - charge - state theory is compatible with available experimental data on gaasn alloys . the influence and specific role of each model parameters",
    "is analyzed and a complete set of them is determined for a particular gaasn alloy sample .",
    "the experimental curves are compared not only with the results of exact model calculation but also with approximate analytical equations derived in the limit of weak or strong pumping powers and small or high magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section[sec:2 ] we extend the theory of shockley - read recombination to allow for the spin polarization and spin - dependent recombination of photocarriers .",
    "we start from a more general three - charge - state model of the sdr and then reduce the consideration to the two - charge - state model for the particular case of cw photoexcitation .",
    "the exact equations are derived for the pl intensity and circular polarization , and analytical equations are derived in the simple limiting cases . in section[sec:3 ] , the values of nine parameters of the two - charge - state model are estimated by using available experimental data and reasonable theoretical considerations .",
    "experimental and theoretical dependencies of the sdr ratio and degree of pl circular polarization on the pumping intensity and magnetic field are presented , compared and discussed in section[sec:4 ] .",
    "section[sec:5 ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "for the @xmath4 transition between the two- and one - electron defect states and @xmath5 for the @xmath6 transition .",
    "lower arrows illustrate the hole excitation ( @xmath7 ) and recombination ( @xmath8 ) . ]    in solids , impurity atoms can form several energy levels in the band gap .",
    "to illustrate we refer to four - level au impurity in germanium  @xcite and three - charged states of interstitial boron in silicon  @xcite or fe , rh in photorefractive crystals  @xcite .",
    "the multicharged states of ga interstitials in gaas are analyzed in reference  @xcite , see also references therein .",
    "the statistics of defects with several trapping levels in semiconductors was analyzed decades ago  @xcite . until now",
    "the rate equations describing light - induced changes in electron and hole densities and occupation of three - charged impurity states has been treated for spin - unpolarized charge carriers  @xcite . in this section",
    "we generalize the consideration to the spin polarized photoelectrons and their spin - dependent recombination via deep paramagnetic centers .",
    "the three - charge - state model is summarized in figure  1(a ) .",
    "we assume that each deep center can be in one of three states @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) representing the center containing , respectively , no electrons , one bound electron with uncompensated spin @xmath11 and two bound electrons in the singlet state with the zero total spin .",

    "note that @xmath17 .",
    "hereafter , we assume the spin relaxation of photoholes to be very fast , neglect their spin polarization and use the notation @xmath18 for the hole density .",

    "the set of equations  ( [ deepcenter])([neutr ] ) contains a lot of parameters . to simplify the analysis we assume that the photoexcitation rate @xmath23 is high enough to neglect the thermal excitation rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , we neglect the influence of band - to - band recombination on the kinetics of charge carriers , set @xmath26 to zero in equations  ( [ maineqs ] ) and use the thus obtained values of @xmath48 and @xmath18 to calculate the photoluminescence ( pl ) intensity and polarization . for the sake of distinctness",
    ", we also assume that , in equilibrium , all the centers bind one electron per center , i.e. , are paramagnetic and @xmath49 .    instead of four variables",

    "a transverse magnetic field of 5 kg strength eliminates the enhancement caused by the circular polarization of the incident light and , as a result , the modified sdr ratio @xmath284 behaves as a function of @xmath25 identically to the dependence @xmath285 .",

    "one can see that the depolarization curve ( hanle effect ) is composed of narrow and wide contours with the half - widths differing by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the main variation of narrow hanle contour takes place at the same magnetic field as for the switching off the pl intensity enhancement which is a clear evidence that the narrow and wide parts of the hanle curve are related to the spin depolarization of bound and free electrons , respectively .    for a quantitative description of the data presented in figures  [ sdrratio ] and [ inthanle2 ]",
