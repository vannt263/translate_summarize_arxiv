    "based on dimensional analysis , it is known that we can construct the planck mass @xmath6 from three fundamental constants , the gravitational constant , the planck constant and the speed of light : @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the combination is determined uniquely and a number of physical interpretations are possible .    by adding cosmological constant ( @xmath3 )",
    ", we may construct two additional mass scales containing @xmath3 , namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 given by @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the two mass scales have been proposed by wesson  @xcite and certain physical interpretations are discussed .",
    "the first and smaller wesson mass , @xmath12 , can be thought of as the minimum mass scale in nature  @xcite , whilst the second and large wesson mass , @xmath10 , is interpreted as the mass of the visible universe  @xcite .",
    "another interesting interpretation of the wesson masses in relation to the hawking temperature can be found in appendix [ app ] .",
    "we should observe that the first wesson mass has no @xmath1 and the second wesson mass has no @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown that these mass scales are all connected by a dimensionless quantity @xmath13 which contains all four fundamental constants . in ref .",

    "classical object having classical radius larger than its own compton wavelength .",
    "interestingly , the fundamental dimensionless quantity @xmath18 can be interpreted to be the number of quantum gravity bits on the entire cosmic horizon area , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "this is the holographic bound on the maximum numbers of degrees of freedom we can put in the observable universe .",
    "a careful reader would notice that each of the `` fundamental '' masses , @xmath20 , is constructed from three out of four natural constants .",
    "it means that we miss one other possible mass scale ; the one without @xmath8 . by simply multiply @xmath12 with dimensionless factor @xmath21 ,",
    "we obtain up to a numerical factor @xmath22 remarkably a mass scale with no @xmath8 independence is not apparent since the authors define @xmath3 to be scaled by @xmath8 in the unit of time .",

    "the new mass scale without @xmath8 is given by another geometric mean @xmath30 , dividing each pair of the mass scales @xmath16 and @xmath31 into one - third the values on the log scale .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to find physical meaning for the mass scales @xmath32 . in the next section",
    ", we will show that a form of generalized uncertainty relation could lead to a physical interpretation of the new mass scales @xmath32 .",
    "we also discuss the consequences of the uncertainty relation to the hawking radiation .",
    "in this section , we will derive the general uncertainty relation in some particular forms and discuss the connection to the mass scales @xmath33 .",
    "there is a number of good review papers on the gup  ( @xcite ) where the reader can consult .",
    "a number of different interpretations and derivations of the gup is also available in those references .",
    "the consequences to the physics of black hole radiation will be explored in subsequent section .",
    "we are all familiar with heisenberg s uncertainty principle , @xmath34 the relation gives a natural limit on how precise we can measure position and momentum of a quantum particle even in the absence of a real measurement . from this relation ,",
    "it is possible to have zero uncertainty in position ( @xmath35 ) when we have infinite uncertainty in momentum .",
    "the uncertainty relation in this original form reflects the wave nature of quantum particle at an instantaneous moment in time .",
    "generally , however , there will be other factors which increase uncertainty of the measurement . if the object or particle under measurement interacts with its own energy / momentum , there will be additional uncertainty proportional to @xmath36 at the leading order .",
    "an example is gravitation where the particle s own gravity gives the minimum position uncertainty of the same size as its schwarzschild radius .",
    "another uncertainty originates from the size of the probe  ( @xmath37 ) we use in the measurement .",
    "thus , @xmath38 gives a generalized uncertainty relation .",
    "previously , @xmath39 can have a value as small as zero , but with the additional uncertainties it is clear that when @xmath40 , @xmath39 also diverges to infinity . hence , there is a non - zero minimum value of position uncertainty @xmath41 which can be calculated from the generalized uncertainty relation . consider @xmath42 by minimizing @xmath39 with respect to @xmath43 , we obtain the uncertainty in momentum that minimizes @xmath39 , @xmath44 certainly we can take the probe  ( particle ) size to be extremely small , e.g. by using short wavelength photon for the measurement .",
    "therefore the @xmath45 term can be taken to be almost arbitrarily small  ( limit on @xmath45 itself is naturally @xmath46 ) and thus @xmath41 is given roughly by the second term @xmath46 .",
    "one generalization of the uncertainty relation which can be expressed in the above form is called the ` minimum length uncertainty relation '  ( mlur ) , @xmath47 the additional term comes from e.g. the following thought experiment  @xcite ; suppose we have a particle traveling parallel to a mirror .",
    "let @xmath48 be the distance between the particle and the mirror .",
    "the time it would require for photon to be emitted from the particle , reflected by the mirror and absorbed back by the same particle is roughly @xmath49 . during this time",
    ", the particle would have acquired an additional position uncertainty @xmath50 .",
    "note that the mlur gives the string - inspired gup  @xcite when @xmath51 .",
    "if we minimize @xmath39 with respect to @xmath43 from the mlur ( [ mlureqn ] ) , we obtain @xmath52    an alternative derivation of the minimum uncertainty ( [ dxmin ] )  ( up to some numerical factor ) is to consider the measurement of the position of the same particle twice in the heisenberg picture , this would yield uncertainty in the distance travelled by that particular particle , @xmath53 from @xmath54=\\hat{p}/m$ ] , we get @xmath55 with this relation , we find that , @xmath56\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\      \\left[\\hat{x}(0),\\hat{x}(t)\\right]&=&i\\hbar\\frac{t}{m } , \\nonumber \\\\      \\delta x(0)\\delta x(t)&\\ge&\\frac{t\\hbar}{2m}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath48 is an apparatus size which we use to measure position of the particle , the observant time is related to @xmath48 by @xmath57  ( if we use photon to measure the position ) , @xmath58 the same result as eqn .",
    "( [ dxmin ] ) up to a numerical factor .",
    "the physical meaning of the above uncertainty is the following .",
    "position uncertainty of a particle increases as time elapses .",
    "the time dependence of the uncertainty is @xmath59 , distinctive characteristic of the random walk .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is the total uncertainty from intrinsic uncertainty due to the wave nature of the particle and the uncertainty from the time elapse required by the measurement process of the apparatus with size @xmath48 .",
    "next we incorporate uncertainty from gravity into the uncertainty relation .",
    "since our particle can not be smaller than its schwarzschild radius , @xmath60 by adding both kinds of position uncertainty together , we get , @xmath61 from this mlur , we find @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the corresponding mass which gives @xmath41 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the planck length .",
    "we may rearrange @xmath41 into another form , @xmath66 we can define the corresponding compton radius for each mass scale as @xmath67 . since @xmath68 and @xmath69 , other possible forms of @xmath41 are @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the compton radius of the new mass scale @xmath5 .",
    "if we set @xmath48 equal to the size of observable universe @xmath72 , then @xmath73 this means @xmath71 is the minimum uncertainty of distance travel by a particle over the size of the observable universe .",
    "alternatively , we can interpret @xmath71 to be the minimum position uncertainty of the particle when the apparatus size is radius of the observable universe @xmath72 . according to ( [ mmin ] ) ,",
    "the corresponding mass that would yield this @xmath41 is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , a possible physical interpretation of @xmath5 is the mass whose the compton radius @xmath74 is the minimal uncertainty of a particle travel over the entire de sitter radius @xmath72 . in other words ,",
    "the _ maximally possible _ minimum uncertainty of position of a particle in the universe is the compton radius of the mass @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ minimally _ possible minimum uncertainty @xmath41 is when we set @xmath75 giving the absolute minimal @xmath76 , the planck length .",
    "numerically , @xmath41 from the mlur is in the range of value from the planck length @xmath77 m to a few femtometers .    other interpretation for @xmath71",
    "is the size of our universe if its density is the planck density(@xmath78 ) , @xmath79 where we assumed that the mass of the universe is @xmath10 .",
    "if we compress the universe until it reaches the planck density , its size will be in the order of @xmath71 .",
    "generally , we believe that a black hole whose temperature is hotter than its surrounding would keep emitting black body radiation until there is nothing left . this assumption is based on the viewpoint of miniature black hole as unstable quantum system",
    ". however , if we apply the mlur to black hole evaporation mechanism , it is possible to stop the process before the black hole can evaporate completely .",
    "the existence of black hole remnants could lead to a possible resolution of the information loss paradox  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    as a rough estimation",
    ", we can apply the heisenberg s uncertainty principle to the black hole evaporation mechanism  @xcite , starting from uncertainty relation , @xmath80 by setting @xmath39 equals to the schwarzschild diameter , @xmath81 gives momentum uncertainty of particle radiated from a black hole .",
    "the corresponding energy uncertainty is then @xmath82 .",
    "if we identify this value as energy of the emitted photon , the corresponding temperature would agree with the hawking temperature up to a factor of @xmath83 , @xmath84 although this result agrees with bekenstein - hawking radiation , it does not prevent black hole from total evaporation . however , if we were to use the string - inspired generalized uncertainty principle , the evaporation process would stop around the planck mass  @xcite .    if instead of the conventional uncertainty relation",
    ", we adopt the mlur relation ( [ mlureqn ] ) .",
    "we can use the new relation to calculate black hole temperature .",
    "we start by multiplying both sides of the equation with @xmath43 and treat it as a quadratic equation , @xmath85 setting @xmath86 , the momentum uncertainty is then @xmath87 by taking the large mass limit , if the negative sign is chosen , this result would agree with hawking temperature with a calibrating factor of @xmath88 .",
    "the positive sign corresponds to no physical meaning .",
    "thus , the temperature of black hole is , @xmath89 by plotting temperature against mass , we can see that the temperature will continue to raise as the mass decreases , just as it should , until the value of @xmath90 rendering term under the square root sign negative and meaningless .",
    "this is the point where black hole evaporation process would stop .",
    "the final value of mass can be determined from @xmath91 leading to @xmath92 it is no surprise that the black hole stops evaporate around the critical mass @xmath63 where the uncertainty in the position of emitted photons is minimum , i.e. @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly , the temperature of the black hole remnant is still positive , @xmath94 the value of the remnant temperature @xmath95 ranges from the planck temperature @xmath96  ( for @xmath75 ) to the temperature @xmath97  ( for @xmath98 ) associated with the new scale @xmath5 , @xmath99 however , since the radiation flux is zero , this positive remnant temperature will be the last temperature of the black hole before the hawking radiation stops . a black hole that has radiated for a longer period of time will have higher uncertainty in @xmath39 . for black hole with the age comparable to @xmath100",
    ", it would stop radiating at mass around @xmath24 when the temperature is @xmath97 .",
    "the additional uncertainty @xmath101 of the mlur in ( [ mlureqn ] ) when applied to hawking radiation can also be interpreted in the following way .",
    "when a black hole emits a particle , we will never know the exact kicked - back momentum of the black hole until the emitted particle is detected , i.e. its wave function has collapsed .",
    "thus , the backreaction from momentum conservation will cause additional uncertainty in its position in the order of @xmath102 where @xmath57 for a distance @xmath48 between black hole and the observer .",

    "mlur is a result of the intrinsic quantum uncertainty and gravitational uncertainty due to the horizon combined with the uncertainty originated in the measurement process by an observer at finite distance from the particle , or by an observer in an apparatus of a finite size .",
    "the probe particle or detector that the observer uses to detect is in an entangled state with the measured particle until the measurement is finished .",
    "once the wave function is collapsed , the observer obtains the information of the measured particle and the probe .",
    "however , during the measurement process while the particle is entangled with the probe , the particle uncertainty increases with time . as a result ,",
    "a minimum uncertainty in position of the particle becomes nonzero .",
    "it can be identified with the compton radius @xmath71  ( roughly a femtometer ) of the mass @xmath5 when the particle is entangled with the entire observable universe .",

    "it also provides another physical interpretation of the mass scales @xmath5 and @xmath24 in terms of universe - age remnant temperature and mass .",
    "finally , in the scenario of black hole radiation where the mlur is adopted , the black hole remnant has thermal entropy with holographic nature , i.e. proportional to its boundary area in the unit of planck area .",
