    "the study of geometric phases continues to be an intriguing subject . since berry s original work  @xcite ,",
    "various generalizations have been proposed  @xcite to adapt to different physical applications in diverse fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite the concept of geometric phases for scattering states was introduced which allows to give a geometric interpretation of the formalism developed by brouwer  @xcite for quantum adiabatic pumping in open systems .",
    "specifically , brouwer presented a compact formula for the pumped charge ( current ) in terms of the parametric derivatives of the time - dependent scattering matrix subjected to the oscillating potential , which has been identified as the geometric phase accompanying the scattering state associated with the time - reversed hamiltonian .",
    "quantum adiabatic pumping in open systems is subject to intense study  @xcite due to the observation of adiabatic electron transport through a quantum dot subject to slow cyclic variation of gate voltages  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing question has been raised recently about the possibility to generate a circulating ( pumping ) current in a ring geometry by adiabatically varying external parameters  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , cohen considered open systems as some subtle limit of closed systems and demonstrated that it is possible to reproduce the formulas by landauer  @xcite and bttiker , prtre and thomas  @xcite from the kubo formula whereas moskalets and bttiker  @xcite examined this problem in the slow frequency limit of the floquet scattering theory .",
    "these differences in approaches mean that the results are different , although they aimed at describing the same system .",
    "such an unsatisfying situation calls for a thorough analysis of the problem . in this letter",
    ", we address this issue from gauge field and geometric phase perspectives .",
    "we derive a compact formula connecting the circulating ( pumping ) current  @xcite and the gauge invariant geometric phases acquired by time - reversed scattering states .",
    "this is achieved by a purely geometric argument , based on the fact that pumped charge is additive for two consecutive pumping cycles .",
    "a generic feature of pumping in a ring geometry is that the momentum is time - dependent and so are the discrete energy levels .",
    "the closed system is different from the open in another aspect . in an open system",
    "there are only two different time scales , whereas in the closed ring geometry three different time scales appear , the adiabatic period , the system time and the dwell time .",
    "the physics behind this is the following . in the adiabatic limit , electrons are in an instantaneous scattering state . a small deformation in the scattering potential results in a small increment of geometric phases , which electrons can pick up at the dwell time scale . the dwell time being the time it takes for an electron to complete one scattering event .",
    "since the electrons travel in a ring geometry , they have to obey the periodic boundary condition to which they adjust at the system time scale , @xmath0 .",
    "all electronic wave functions are extended over the entire ring thus inducing a circulating current .",
    "the latter is experimentally measurable in terms of a squid that measures the magnetic field produced by the circulating current .",
    "consider a quantum dot with two leads attached such that the two single - channel leads are bent back to form a ring [ see fig .",
    "[ setup : fig](a ) ] .",
    "( a ) shows the setup with a time dependent scatterer , defined by its scattering matrix , @xmath1 .",
    "incident , @xmath2 , and reflected wave , @xmath3 .",
    "( b ) shows the time scales relevant to the problem .",
    "scattering takes place on @xmath0 , the dwell time ( the time it takes for the scattering event ) is @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 designates the time passing for the scattering event , it is only valid on the @xmath0-scale .",
    "the time it takes for the wave function to adjust the boundary conditions to the scatterer , of the order of @xmath0 , must be shorter than the adiabatic changes in the scatterer , happening on the scale @xmath6 . ]",
    "suppose the dot is characterized by a scattering matrix @xmath1 which depends on time @xmath7 via a set of independent external parameters @xmath8 oscillating slowly with frequency @xmath9 .",
    "for a spin - independent scatterer , @xmath1 is a @xmath10 matrix .",
    "define the row vectors @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the unitarity of the scattering matrix implies that they are orthonormal @xmath13 , where @xmath14 from the boundary condition of the matching of the wavefunction for a ring geometry , the dispersion equation is written in terms of scattering matrices , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath18 is the scattering matrix describing the remaining part of the ring except the dot .",
    "the energy spectrum is then discrete in the ring geometry .",
    "the adiabaticity requires that the frequency @xmath9 is small enough compared with the ( averaged ) level spacing @xmath19 . on the other hand , for the instantaneous scattering matrix to make sense , it is necessary that the system time @xmath20 ( @xmath21- electron velocity ) is much greater than the dwell time @xmath4@xcite during which electrons scatter off the scatterer .",
    "that is , in the ring geometry , there are three different time scales : the period @xmath22 , the system time @xmath23 , and the dwell time , @xmath24 . in the scattering approach to adiabatic quantum pumping in the ring geometry , we assume @xmath25 .",
    "this condition ensures that it is legitimate to speak of instantaneous scattering states , consistent with heisenberg uncertainty principle  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ setup : fig](b ) and notice that it is different from the adiabaticity condition discussed in ref .",
    "generically , the allowed ( discrete ) @xmath26 s , which in turn determine the discrete energy levels , are time - dependent due to the fact that the external parameters defining the scatterer @xmath8 are changing with time and the scattering matrix are decisive for the dispersion , a feature different from scattering in open systems .    _ discretized approach and the continuous limit .",
    "_ suppose the system undergoes an adiabatic cycle with the period @xmath6 , which is characterized by a closed loop in parameter space .",
    "suppose that initially an electron is in a given discrete energy level , the adiabaticity ensures that it remains in the same level during the entire period . to take into account the time scales properly",
    ", we adopt a discretized approach , i.e. , the entire interval @xmath27 $ ] is divided into @xmath28 pieces .",
    "correspondingly , the closed loop may be regarded approximately as a polygon [ see fig .",
    "[ contour : fig](a ) ] .",
    "( a ) displays the discretization of the adiabatic loop . doing this",
    ", we can ensure that the scattering matrix formalism gives a correct description and distinguish the time scales associated with the theory . here",
    ", the entire interval @xmath27 $ ] is divided into @xmath28 pieces .",
    "each subinterval @xmath29 $ ] is of the same order of magnitude as the system time @xmath0 . at each instant , @xmath30 , two new vectors",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined in terms of the instantaneous @xmath33-matrix .",
    "( b ) displays the property that the geometric phase is additive , and the pumped charge being a function of the geometric phase has to be additive .",
    "the lower contour displays a special case in which two cycles share the same initial configuration , represented by a dot , whereas the upper contour shows two separate cycles joined by two adjacent but opposite lines . ]    here we stress that each subinterval @xmath34 $ ] is at the same order of magnitude as the system time @xmath35 . at each instant @xmath30",
    ", we have two row vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "since the argument is parallel , we drop the superscripts @xmath38 and @xmath39 for brevity . for two consecutive instants @xmath30 and @xmath40",
    ", we may define the relative phase between the two vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "that is , @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we have the total phase for the closed loop ( polygon ) @xmath45 that is , both @xmath46 and @xmath47 acquire a geometric phase @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respective , if the system returns to the initial configuration after one adiabatic cycle . indeed , eq .  (",
    "[ phi : eq ] ) is invariant under the ( local ) gauge transformation @xmath50 , which arises from the fact that the absolute phase is not observable in quantum mechanics . in the continuum limit",
    ", we have @xmath51 this amounts to the statement that the gauge potential @xmath2 is @xmath52 up to an ( integrable ) immaterial term . indeed , in the adiabatic limit",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the gauge potential @xmath2 _ only _ depends on @xmath53 and @xmath38 . from this",
    "we see that the most general gauge potential we can construct takes the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 an arbitrary function , if we require that @xmath2 transforms as @xmath56 under the gauge transformation . here",
    "the second term proportional to @xmath57 comes from the dependence of discrete @xmath26 s on time . below we will see that @xmath58 .",
    "although the gauge potential @xmath2 is formally identical to its counterpart in the case of open systems when expressed in terms of the row vector @xmath59 , the explicit dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath26 which varies with time characterizes the difference .",
    "similarly , we may define two column vectors @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , which are orthonormal due to the unitarity of the @xmath33 matrix . repeating the above argument",
    ", we conclude that @xmath62 and @xmath63 acquire , respectively , geometric phases @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which take the form , @xmath66 . here",
    "the hat denotes the time - reversal operation since the row vectors and column vectors are connected via time reversal operation .    _ consistency with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "_ the above discussion indicates that there is a gauge group @xmath67 , which is necessary to accommodate the geometric phases @xmath68 and @xmath69 acquired by the two row vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "as we see , this results from the gauge freedom associated with the incident waves .",
    "in contrast to adiabatic pumping in open systems , one has to keep in mind that the scattering wave functions should satisfy the periodic boundary condition in the ring geometry .",
    "if we set @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 , then the incident waves and the scattered waves are connected via @xmath76 and @xmath77 . on the other hand",
    ", the period boundary condition requires that @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . besides the dispersion equation which results in discrete energy spectrum , we have @xmath80 . formally , we write the scattering state @xmath81 as @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    ". then the @xmath67 gauge transformation takes the form @xmath85 , which induces transformations on @xmath2 and @xmath86 : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "then we see that under such a gauge transformation the dispersion equation remains the same , but an extra phase factor @xmath89 appears in the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath86 . with @xmath90 and @xmath91 as the local basis , the time evolution governed by the schrdinger equation induces parallel transport  @xcite . taking into account the causality condition which states that scattered waves appear _ only after _",
    "incident waves hit the scatterer , we may derive the expression of the gauge potential @xmath2 ( where @xmath55 is determined to be i/4 ) , resulting in the geometric phases @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "when the system is brought back to the initial configuration , the scattering states @xmath92 and @xmath93 acquire , respectively , geometric phases @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "now we may picturize the observable effect of geometric phases as follows .",
    "suppose the system undergoes an adiabatic cycle . during this process , at each instant",
    ", electrons are in an instantaneous scattering state .",
    "when electrons feel a slow deformation in the scattering potential , they pick up a small increment of geometric phases at the dwell time @xmath4 scale , and then take time at the system time @xmath0 scale to redistribute themselves to maintain the periodic boundary conditions , thus inducing the circulating current in the pumping experiment setup .    in the above we focused on scattering geometric phases acquired by scattering states .",
    "however , in the pumping setup , physical observables are connected with pumping geometric phases associated with time - reversed scattering states , a fact already known for pumping in open systems .",
    "in fact , there is another gauge group @xmath67 associated with the gauge freedom of the scattered waves , which accommodates the geometric phases @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    _",
    "connection between physical observables and geometric phases .",
    "_ now let us establish the connection between the geometric phases @xmath96 and",
    "@xmath97 and the physical observables which are the charge @xmath98 accumulated inside the dot and the charge @xmath99 circulating in the ring during the entire pumping period @xmath6 for a given occupied level . suppose @xmath100 and @xmath101 are , respective , the charges pumped from the dot to the left and right sides . obviously , we have @xmath102 . as for @xmath99",
    ", one may expect that it is proportional to @xmath103 , i.e. , .",
    "@xmath104 with @xmath105 some undetermined constant .",
    "to determine @xmath105 , we consider the special case in which no charge is accumulated inside the dot .",
    "in such a case , we have @xmath106 .",
    "that is , the amount of charge q is pumped from the left side to the right side of the dot .",
    "then we have @xmath107 .    as observables , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "must be gauge invariant , so they must be some functions of the geometric phases @xmath108 and @xmath109 . since the left and right sides are independent , we have @xmath110 for a given closed loop ( here we drop the superscripts for brevity . ) . to determine the function @xmath111",
    ", we notice that the charge is additive .",
    "that is , if we consider a closed loop consisting of two consecutive closed loops @xmath112 and @xmath113 [ see the lower contour in fig .  [",
    "contour : fig](b ) ] , then we have @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometric phase is abelian , implying that @xmath115 .",
    "that is , @xmath116 .",
    "> from this we see that the function must be linear , i.e. , @xmath117 with @xmath118 an undetermined constant . combining this with the friedel sum rule which states that charge accumulated inside the scatterer follows @xmath119",
    ", we have @xmath120 . actually , the argument is applicable to any two arbitrary loops as illustrated in the upper contour in fig .",
    "[ contour : fig](b ) .    in the context of adiabatic pumping , we are interested in pumping cycles without any charge accumulated inside the dot . in this case , we have @xmath121 .",
    "so we may define the circulating current @xmath122 as @xmath123 , which takes the form @xmath124 > from this we immediately conclude that _ for an embedded quantum dot with the mirror symmetry , i.e. , the left - right symmetry , there is no pumping circulating current . _",
    "this is consistent with moskalets and bttiker  @xcite who stated that the spatial asymmetry of the scatterer is a necessary condition for the existence of an adiabatic pump effect .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",

    "@xmath134 denotes the coordinate along the ring .",
    "the same potential has been used to model the quantum dot embedded in a double path interferometer proposed to directly observe scattering geometric phase  @xcite . then the instantaneous spin - independent @xmath10 scattering matrix @xmath1 for the dot may be determined from the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath135 . for a dot of size 800 nm the energy level",
    "spacing is of the order of 4.5 mev .",
    "the coulomb energy , assuming a dielectric constant of 10 , is of the order of 0.08 mev .",
    "thus , the dimension of the dot is such that the coulomb energy is much less than the separation between the resonances and can be ignored .",

    "however , in this figure we can see that the current can change sign ( thus direction ) as a function of the filling , and the effect is larger for a smaller number of electrons .",
    "this can be detected by measuring the magnetic field produced by electrons traveling around the ring .    in conclusion , we have studied adiabatic scattering in a ring geometry and established the connection between the circulating ( pumping ) current and the geometric phases acquired by the time - reversed scattering states based on a pure geometric argument .",
    "this may be viewed as a generalization of persistent currents in a mesoscopic ring , in the sense that the aharonov - bohm effect is a special case of berry s phases .",
