    "the observed bias in biopolymers composed from homochiral l - amino acids and d - sugars towards a single handedness or chirality is a remarkable feature of biological chemistry .",
    "nowadays , there is a firm consensus that the homochirality of biological compounds is a condition associated to life that probably emerged in the prebiotic phase of evolution through processes of spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking ( smsb ) @xcite .",
    "this could have proceeded by incorporating steps of increasing complexity thus leading to chemical systems and enantioselective chemical networks @xcite .",
    "theoretical proposals for the emergence of homochirality in abiotic chemical evolution , are based either on deterministic or on chance events @xcite .",
    "however , the current state of knowledge strongly suggests that the emergence of chirality must be based on reactions leading to spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking .",
    "smsb are transformations yielding chiral outcomes as non - thermodynamic final stable states , and in the absence of any chiral polarization or external chiral physical forces @xcite .",
    "this is provided by enantioselective autocatalysis , but not by the simple linear asymmetric induction reactions @xcite on which past discussions on deterministic or chance phenomena were based for the justification of biological homochirality .",
    "systems capable of smsb lead to a stochastic distribution of final chiral signs between successive experiments .",
    "nowadays this deterministic versus chance debate is restricted to more specific scenarios @xcite .",
    "the smsb abiotic scenario for the emergence of single homochirality in the biological world implies that single asymmetry emerges provided a small chiral fluctuation with respect to the idealized racemic state can be amplified @xcite to a state capable of biotic evolution .",
    "relevant features common to such systems are that they take into account the small fluctuations about the racemic state and that they display _ non - linear _ kinetic effects . these stochastic scenarios are theoretically well understood on general grounds @xcite and equally important , are experimentally feasible in the laboratory @xcite .    on the theoretical side , for describing systems capable of smsb , the frank model has been widely invoked to justify the emergence of biological homochirality @xcite .",
    "the original model @xcite consists of an irreversible enantioselective autocatalysis eq.([frank1953 ] ) and an irreversible mutual inhibition reaction eq.([mutual ] ) between the product enantiomers , in an open - flow system : @xmath0 this model has been extensively studied , allowing for reversible transformations and in diverse open - system scenarios @xcite .",
    "the significance of the mutual inhibition step eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) is that it makes smsb possible for first - order enantioselective autocatalysis , such as that of eq .",
    "( [ frank1953 ] ) .",
    "although enantioselective autocatalyses of quadratic and higher orders may by themselves lead theoretically to smsb , they correspond to reactions of unrealistically high molecularity . for example , biological replicators of interest for enantioselective autocatalytic transformations , have their mechanisms composed by consecutive bi - molecular reactions .",
    "this means that , by themselves , these replicators _ can not amplify _ the initial enantiomeric excess ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the coupling to a mutual inhibition reaction between the enantiomers can enable smsb for some reaction and system parameters .",
    "therefore , the chemically significant scenarios for the study of the emergence of chirality are those consisting of simple linear enantioselective autocatalyses coupled to reaction networks that include a mutual inhibition step .    originally proposed as an alternative to the frank model , the limited enantioselectivity ( les ) model is composed of entirely reversible steps : an enantioselective autocatalytic reaction eq.([lesscheme ] ) , a limited enantioselective autocatalysis eq.([limited ] ) , and direct production of enantiomers from an achiral precursor eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) @xcite : @xmath2 note that the _ inverse _ reaction in eq.([limited ] ) with rate @xmath3 provides the necessary chiral inhibition step , thus effectively replacing frank s mutual inhibition eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) leading to the inert product @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamic stability properties of racemic and chiral states in fully reversible versions of frank and in les , including hetero- and homo - dimerization , in both open and closed systems , are reported in detail in @xcite .",
    "typically , rate equation theory ( in the mean field approximation ) is used to cast chemical reaction schemes in terms of coupled differential equations for the temporal evolution of the concentrations of the chemical species involved . in this deterministic kinetic dynamics , _ initial conditions _ must be taken to simulate the inherent statistical chiral fluctuations about the ideal racemic composition @xcite .",
    "in contrast , real chemical reactions are inherently stochastic in nature : the reagents in solution ( or attached on surfaces ) must encounter each other before they can react , and the probability per unit time for the reaction to occur is related to the corresponding reaction rate constant , which depends on the temperature .",
    "the molecular nature of chemical reagents and reactions gives rise to the concept of intrinsic _ reaction noise _ , and is typically multiplicative @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that stochastic and deterministic kinetics must coincide in the macroscopic limit ( i.e. , for large numbers of molecules ) , stochastic methods can be used to address the question of whether such internal noise affects the final outcome of the underlying reaction , and in what way it might do so . the answer to",
    "this question depends on the specific process studied .",
    "thus , for example , reaction noise explains the anomalous scaling in reactions undergoing dynamic phase transitions from active to absorbing states @xcite .",
    "the influence that reaction noise may have in schemes purporting to lead to smsb is readily investigated . in the case of the frank model with _",
    "reversible _ autocatalysis ( defined by the pair of eqs.([lesscheme],[mutual ] ) ) , reaction noise induces complete chiral amplification starting from ideally racemic initial conditions in spatially extended domains , but this result requires the parameter @xmath5 , controlling the symmetry breaking transition , to satisfy the same condition as for the deterministic model , namely @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "that is , the _ final outcome _ of the reaction scheme is governed solely by this simple condition , irrespective of whether internal noise is included in the temporal evolution or not . on the other hand ,",
    "neither chiral bias nor external physical chiral polarizations need be invoked to achieve homochirality when reaction noise is included @xcite .",
    "hence , the initial and subsequent chiral fluctuations intrinsic to the system @xcite are included automatically .",
    "stochastic methods are necessary to describe kinetic dynamics in the case of small volumes and/or small numbers of reacting molecules @xcite , as is the case , for example , in compartmentalized cellular processes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the differences in the evolution of the @xmath1 between deterministic and stochastic kinetics should provide better insights regarding asymmetric inductions and smsb processes in living systems . in this respect ,",
    "internal noise has been considered recently in a closed - mass model which results from taking strictly irreversible enantioselective autocatalysis , eq.([frank1953 ] ) together with the direct production and decay of the enantiomers , eq.([direct ] ) @xcite .",
    "stability analyses for the deterministic model show that the final stable state is necessarily racemic . yet",
    ", the claim was made that reaction noise stabilizes the homochiral states , making these the most probable outcome of the system . according to this , in systems governed by stochastic kinetics ,",
    "i.e. , before coinciding with the limit of deterministic kinetics , the linear decay of the enantiomers to the compound a ( eq . ( [ direct ] ) ) is to play the role of mutual inhibition for achieving smsb , i.e. , the homochiral states are supposed to result without requiring additional  non - linearities \" nor even chiral inhibition itself .    in this paper",
    "we analyze these claims in detail . as the need for chiral inhibition in smsb",
    "has been questioned @xcite , we draw a careful distinction between linear racemization and non - linear mutual inhibition in sec [ sec : inhibs ] . the constraints dictated by detailed balance , often overlooked in the modeling of biological homochirality , are discussed in sec [ sec : micro ] . in sec [ sec : results ] we consider the influence , for both well - mixed and small spatially coupled systems , that reaction noise has on the stationary states of the chemical scheme when detailed balance is properly accounted for . in sec",
    "[ sec : cycles ] we address the problem of coupling chemical reaction schemes to external energy sources for driving _ unidirectional _ cyclic reactions , a minimum requirement for biological systems .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec [ sec : disc ] .",
    "details of the calculation of the probability distribution for the enantiomeric excess are relegated to an appendix .",
    "as the scheme in @xcite ( i ) dispenses with chiral inhibition and ( ii ) overlooks the principle of detailed balance , we consider these two concepts below , bringing in some closely related reaction schemes for illustrative purposes .",
    "the frank model @xcite involves enantioselective autocatalysis coupled to a reaction between the two enantiomers of product / catalyst yielding an achiral addition product .",
    "the term  mutual chiral inhibition \" was coined for this reaction because it represents the decrease of chiral compounds in a racemic ratio .",
    "this leads to an increase in the value of the enantiomeric excess @xmath1 . when this occurs faster than the reverse enantioselective autocatalysis , namely when @xmath7 , a cooperative effect drives the amplification of the @xmath1 in the enantioselective autocatalysis : eq.([frank1953 ] ) or eq.([lesscheme ] ) . as remarked above , in",
    "les this mutual chiral inhibition is manifested via the inverse non - enantioselective autocatalysis , eq.([limited ] ) .",
    "compared to frank , in les no inert product p nor achiral heterodimer is formed , but instead the recycling of one enantiomer back to the achiral precursor a plus the mirror image enantiomer .",
    "this reverse reaction implies the disappearance of only one stoichiometric part of the racemic mixture ( either d or l ) , but in the dynamics of the system there is a non - linear dependence on the heterochiral interaction @xmath8\\times[d]$ ] , just as in the case of the mutual inhibition stage of frank - like systems .",
    "the importance for smsb of coupling enantioselective autocatalysis of first order ( eq.([frank1953 ] ) or eq.([lesscheme ] ) ) with such inhibition stages [ eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) or eq.([limited ] ) ] is due to the fact that the autocatalysis _ by itself _ can not yield smsb . in lieu of these inhibitions",
    ", there is no amplification of chirality , and in the best of cases , ( open flow systems , or systems with heterogeneous energy distributions , etc . ) , the production of chiral matter can only maintain the initial @xmath1 value .",
    "the significance of the heterochiral inhibition stage , when coupled to an enantioselective autocatalysis of first order , is that the overall reaction network is then able to lead to smsb .",
    "this chiral state is a non - thermodynamic one , but is the more stable state of the system .",
    "the reaction of eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) , has been reported @xcite as being able to play the role of the needed inhibition stage for smsb in enantioselective autocatalysis of first order , by appealing to the presence of reaction noise .",
    "the character of such an inhibition stage , however , is easily appreciated by re - expressing it as follows : @xmath9 the reactions of eqs.([direct],[direct1 ] ) are identical and the direct transformation between enantiomers in eq.([direct2 ] ) represents an equivalent overall transformation , as far as l and d are concerned .",
    "what actually differs between all three is the temporal or spatial resolution or scale at which we can resolve them into individual steps or else as overall , collective reactions .",
    "thus the first , eq.([direct ] ) , describes two individual reactions , but because of the degenerate character of enantiomerism , the existence of one reaction implies necessarily the existence of the enantiomeric one . the second eq .",
    "( [ direct1 ] ) is identical to ( [ direct ] ) , but it can also include a single reaction going through a non - stable intermediate , and the third eq .",
    "( [ direct2 ] ) is a single reaction with no intermediate species made explicit .",
    "all these reactions are the basic transformations representing the chemical process known as  racemization \" .",
    "the common effect of such reactions determines , in the case of closed systems with homogeneous energy distribution , that any initial @xmath1 value must decrease towards the unavoidable racemic mixture .",
    "note that the three eqs .",
    "( [ direct]-[direct2 ] ) lead to the decrease the total chiral matter , but the underlying dynamics does not involve a non - linear dependence on the racemic composition @xcite .",
    "this non - linearity is expressed in deterministic kinetics by the dependence on the product of the concentrations of both enantiomers , and in stochastic kinetics by the existence of a non - elastic heterochiral collision between the enantiomers .",
    "the rate constants in les are constrained by the principle of microreversibility @xcite : @xmath10 the les model has had a controversial reputation in the past because the constraints dictated by microreversibility or detailed balance , have not always been correctly considered nor properly taken into account @xcite . using eq.([lesconstraint ] ) one proves that les in a closed to mass flow system at uniform temperature can not lead to either temporary nor permanent chiral symmetry breaking : the racemic state is the only stable outcome @xcite . in order to overcome these microreversibility constraints",
    "necessarily requires extending the reaction model via coupling to external energy sources and/or to external reagents .",
    "the new reactions or energy fluxes thus introduced alter the overall set of ( original ) transformations and can allow for the ( partial ) lifting of the original microreversibility constraints .",
    "thus for example , when the enantioselective and the limited enantioselective autocatalyses are individually _ localized _ within regions of low and hot temperatures , respectively , in a thermal gradient , mirror symmetry can be broken permanently @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "when the reverse reaction of the non - enantioselective autocatalysis is driven by an external reagent , les in a uniform temperature can break mirror symmetry permanently @xcite .",
    "both these modifications maintain les far from equilibrium and also lift the constraints eq.([lesconstraint ] ) on some of the reaction rates .",
    "even so , this does not imply we can set any of the inverse rate constants to zero ( and we can not : doing so would violate eq .",
    "( [ lesconstraint ] ) ) .",
    "artifacts in mathematical modeling can and do arise when ( i ) reactions are approximated by irreversible transformations and especially when ( ii ) irreversible and reversible reactions are combined _ together _ in the same scheme @xcite , as was done in @xcite . note that the original frank scheme eqs([frank1953],[mutual ] ) involves only irreversible reactions ( understood as approximations ) , but here there is no constraint dictated by microreversibility : in this case both rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 are independent .",
    "the rates for the modified frank model with reversible autocatalysis and mutual inhibition : eqs .",
