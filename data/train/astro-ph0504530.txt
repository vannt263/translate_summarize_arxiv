    "about @xmath3 of the stellar luminosity in the universe comes from the bulges of disk galaxies ( persic & salucci 1992 ; fukugita et al . 1998 ) . therefore understanding how bulges form is a necessary step in understanding galaxy formation in general .",
    "if bulges are distinct entities , rather than just disk light in excess of an exponential ( van den bosch  2002 ; bker  2003 ) , a mechanism for generating them separate from disk formation must be considered . because bulges sit at the bottom of the potential wells of galaxies , many paths for their formation are possible .",
    "bulge formation scenarios can be classified loosely based on whether the driving mechanism is internal or external .",
    "a widely discussed example of externally - driven bulge formation is in the merger at early times of dwarf - sized galactic subunits around which disks subsequently grow ( kauffmann  1993 ) .",
    "observational evidence supporting this scenario includes the relatively homogeneous bulge stellar populations in the milky way ( ferreras  2003 ; zoccali  2003 ) and andromeda ( stephens  2003 ) , and counter - rotation found in some galaxies ( pizzella  2004 ) .    discussion of internally driven bulge formation has focused on the secular evolution of disk instabilities .",
    "observational evidence supporting secular bulge formation includes disk - like , almost - exponential light profiles ( andredakis & sanders 1994 ; courteau  1996 ; de jong 1996 ; carollo  2001 ; carollo 1999 ; carollo  1998 ; macarthur  2003 ) , occasionally disk - like , cold kinematics ( kormendy 1993 ; kormendy  2002 ) , the correlation between the scale - lengths of bulges and disks ( de jong 1996 ; macarthur  2003 ) and the similar average colors of bulges and inner disks ( terndrup  1994 ; peletier & balcells 1996 ; courteau 1996 ) .",
    "the recent review of kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) summarizes our current understanding of , and evidence for , secular formation of some bulges .",
    "the bulges of many edge - on galaxies are box- or peanut- ( b / p ) shaped ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 ; jarvis 1986 ) .",
    "binney & petrou ( 1985 ) constructed axisymmetric models of b / p bulge systems including cylindrical rotation as observed ( kormendy & illingworth 1982 ) .",
    "they speculated that accretion is responsible for creating such systems ; however observations found little evidence of accretion onto them ( shaw 1987 ; whitmore & bell 1988 , but see also ltticke 2004 ) .",
    "a different scenario emerged from 3-d @xmath1-body simulations , namely formation via secular evolution of bars ( combes & sanders 1981 ) , either through resonant scattering or through bending instabilities ( pfenniger 1984 ; combes  1990 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; raha  1991 ) .",
    "the orbits supporting peanuts have been studied extensively ( combes  1990 ; pfenniger 1984 ; pfenniger 1985 ; patsis  2002a ) and shown to generally arise from vertically unstable x1 orbits .",
    "patsis  ( 2002b ) showed that these orbits are present and peanuts are possible even if the non - axisymmetric perturbation is very weak .",
    "thereafter , observational efforts sought to establish the connection between b / p - shaped bulges and bars by seeking evidence for a bar in edge - on b / p - bulged systems . in the case of ngc 4442 ,",
    "the b / p bulge is already apparent at an inclination of @xmath4 , at which the bar also can be recognized ( bettoni & galletta 1994 ) . a second such case is ngc 7582 at an inclination of @xmath5 ( quillen  1997 ) . in several b / p bulges , photometric features of a bar",
    "have been claimed (  de carvalho & da costa 1987 ) but the bar interpretation is not unique when only photometry is available .",
    "the fraction of edge - on bulges having b / p shapes is @xmath6 ( ltticke  2000 ) , which is consistent with the fraction of galaxies containing bars ( @xmath7 , knapen  2000 ; eskridge  2000 ) once the arbitrary orientations of bars to the line - of - sight ( los ) are considered .",
    "however , the most important evidence for the presence of bars in b / p bulges comes from a comparison of the edge - on gas and stellar los velocity distributions ( losvds ) of @xmath1-body bars ( bureau & athanassoula 1999 ; athanassoula & bureau 1999 ; bureau & athanassoula 2004 ) and real galaxies ( kuijken & merrifield 1995 ; merrifield & kuijken 1999 ; bureau & freeman 1999 ; chung & bureau 2004 ) .",
    "these edge - on studies have established the connection between b / p - shaped bulges and bars .",
    "however , the degeneracy inherent in deprojecting edge - on galaxies makes it difficult to study other properties of the host galaxy .",
    "moreover , while b / p shapes are produced by bars , this does not exclude the possibility that bulges are _ shaped _ by secular processes , not formed by them . addressing this issue",
    "requires an attempt at a cleaner separation of bulges , bars and peanuts . in face - on systems",
    "the viewing geometry is well - constrained and bars are readily apparent .",
    "if we can also recognize peanuts in them then we obtain an important new perspective on the relation of peanuts and bars .",
    "for example , this permits study of the relative sizes of bars and peanuts : meager observational evidence suggests that these need not be equal ( kormendy and kennicutt 2004 ) , in agreement with simulations ( below ) .",
    "moreover , for inclinations @xmath8 , it becomes possible to measure accurately the pattern speed of the bar ( debattista 2003 ) and therefore to test for resonances and compare with theoretical predictions",
    ". it would also allow determination of the fraction of barred galaxies with peanuts , which may be different from the fraction of peanuts with bars . and",
    "finally , as we will show below , the ability to detect peanuts face - on opens the possibility of exploring bulge formation mechanisms .    in this paper",
    "we examine the kinematic signature of peanuts in face - on galaxies . in section [ sec : exact ] we first explore some simple analytic models to help understand the behavior of more realistic systems .",
    "working with gauss - hermite moments ( gerhard 1993 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) , we show that the fourth - order losvd moment , @xmath0 , is monotonically increasing with @xmath9 , the fourth - order vertical density moment .",
    "thus @xmath0 can be used to probe the vertical structure of a disk .",
    "we describe the @xmath1-body building in section [ sec : ics ] and in section [ sec : nbody ] we present the @xmath1-body models , with and without strong peanuts , used in this paper and examine their vertical density distributions .",
    "we show that the main signature of a peanut is in @xmath9 , rather than in the disk scale - height .",
    "we explore the vertical losvds of these @xmath1-body models in section [ sec : kine ] , showing that @xmath0 can be used as a robust kinematic signature of a peanut , independent of bar strength . in section [ sec : inc ] we show that moderate inclinations do not substantially degrade the diagnostic .",
    "section [ sec : observs ] discusses the required signal - to - noise and spectral resolution and our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we first consider some exact models useful for interpreting the results of @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "peanuts constitute a density distribution more vertically extended than the surrounding disk .",
    "let us denote the root - mean - square ( rms ) height and vertical velocity as @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "deviations from gaussian distributions can be parameterized by the moments of an expansion in gauss - hermite functions ( gerhard 1993 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the second order term in such an expansion is related to the rms . the third order term measures deviations which are asymmetric about the mean and are therefore likely to be small for the vertical density and velocity distributions of disk galaxies .",
    "the fourth order term measures the lowest order symmetric deviation from a gaussian ; it is negative when a distribution is broader than gaussian and positive when it is more peaked .",
    "we denote the fourth order gauss - hermite moment of the vertical density distribution as @xmath9 and that for the losvd as @xmath0 .",
    "following gerhard ( 1993 ) , for a vertical losvd @xmath12 normalized to the projected surface density @xmath13 , we define @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath9 . for a particle model ,",
    "the integral becomes a sum and @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath17 , the number of particles in a bin .",
    "the vertical density extension associated with the peanut will correspond to an increase in @xmath10 ( the `` scale - height '' ) and/or a decrease in @xmath9 .",
    "what is the observable effect on the losvd of such variations ?",
    "first consider how @xmath11 varies as a function of radius in the case where @xmath10 is constant . in a single - component axisymmetric system ,",
    "the one - dimensional vertical boltzmann@xmath18poisson equation is @xmath19 (  binney & tremaine eqn .",
    "4 - 38 ) . if the system is isothermal , then @xmath20 is independent of @xmath21 ( and is therefore equal to @xmath22 ) .",
    "the solution of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sigmaz ] is @xmath23 ( spitzer 1942 ) , where @xmath24 is the density in the mid - plane and @xmath25 ( note that for the isothermal disk , @xmath26 . ) thus if @xmath27 is ( nearly ) constant ( as suggested by observations [ van der kruit & searle 1981 ; de grijs & peletier 1997 ] ) then @xmath28 . since typically @xmath29 , then @xmath30 and it is likely that any signature of the peanut in @xmath11 will be swamped by this density - driven radial variation .",
    "next we use simple models to explore the signature in the losvd of a flat - topped vertical density distribution . consider camm s ( 1950 ) series of analytic solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation for systems stratified in plane - parallel layers of infinite extent .",
    "this is a good local approximation to real galaxies at low @xmath21 when the rotation curve is flat ( van der kruit & freeman 1986 ) . in camm",
    "s model iii , the density distribution is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , and the parameter @xmath33 is defined by the relation @xmath34 with @xmath35 some constant .",
    "several examples of this density distribution for different @xmath36 are presented in figure [ fig : cammdens ] .",
    "the corresponding distribution function is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization constant .",
    "these densities and distribution functions can be integrated numerically to compute @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig : cammz4h4 ] .",
    "the limit @xmath39 corresponds to the isothermal sheet , in which the distribution function has the same gaussian dependence on velocity at all heights .",
    "thus in this limit , @xmath40 . on the other hand , the isothermal sheet has a @xmath41 profile which is more peaked than a gaussian and therefore has @xmath42 . at smaller @xmath36 ,",
    "the density profile becomes increasingly flat - topped leading to @xmath43 which drives @xmath44 .",
    "two properties of @xmath0 make it an excellent probe of @xmath9 .",
    "first is the fact that @xmath0 increases monotonically with @xmath9 , which makes @xmath0 an observable surrogate for the unobservable @xmath9 .",
    "second , @xmath45 , so that the vertical velocity distribution is generally broader than the density distribution , which makes it observationally robust .",
    "we use @xmath1-body models with different initial conditions and evolved on different codes to study the kinematic signatures of face - on peanuts . since gas is generally depleted within bars , and moreover dissipates its vertical energy , it is not a good tracer of face - on peanuts .",
    "we therefore focus on only the stellar kinematics of peanuts , and our simulations are all collisionless .",
    "table [ tab : sims ] lists all the simulations used in this study .",
    "the highest resolution simulations in this paper were run on a 3-d cylindrical particle - mesh ( pm ) grid code ( described in sellwood & valluri 1997 ) .",
    "the main advantages of this code for the present study are that it permits high spatial and mass resolutions ; indeed these simulations used @xmath46 disk particles and force softening @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ( constant ) gaussian vertical scale - height of the initial conditions .",
    "since gauss - hermite moments generally require high signal - to - noise ratios to be measured reliably , a large number of particles is desirable . at the same time",
    ", the high force resolution ensures that the vertical motions of particles are well resolved .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the rigid halos were represented by either a spherical logarithmic potential , @xmath49 or a hernquist ( 1990 ) model @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a halo scale - radius , @xmath52 is a characteristic halo velocity and @xmath53 is a halo mass .",
    "we define @xmath54 for the hernquist halos .",
    "the initially axisymmetric disks were all srsic type @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fraction of the active (  bulge@xmath18disk ) mass which is in the bulge , @xmath57 is the active mass , @xmath58 is the disk scale - length , @xmath48 is the gaussian thickness and @xmath36 is the srsic index ( @xmath59 corresponding to an exponential profile and @xmath60 to a de vaucouleurs profile ) .",
    "disk kinematic setup used the epicyclic approximation with constant toomre-@xmath61 and the vertical jeans equation to set vertical motions appropriate for a constant gaussian thickness .",
    "we use units where @xmath62 , which gives a unit of time @xmath63 .",
    "bulges were generated using the method of prendergast & tomer ( 1970 ) , where a distribution function is integrated iteratively in the global potential until convergence .",
    "we used the isotropic distribution function of a lowered polytrope , truncated at @xmath64 @xmath65^{1/2 } -             \\left[-e_{\\rm max}\\right]^{1/2}. \\label{eqn : df}\\ ] ] here @xmath66 , the total potential at @xmath67 in the disc plane .",
    "for all bulges we set @xmath68 .",
    "the bulges in runs b2 and b3 were fully rotating , while that in run b1 had no rotation .",
    "further details of the compound system setup method used can be found in debattista & sellwood ( 2000 ) .",
    "the polar grids were @xmath69 or larger .",
    "for all the pm simulations , the vertical spacing of the grid planes , @xmath70 , was set to @xmath71 .",
    "we used fourier terms up to @xmath72 in the potential , which was softened with the standard plummer kernel .",
    "time integration was performed with a leapfrog integrator with a fixed time - step , @xmath73 for simulations b1-b3 , @xmath74 for run r4 and @xmath75 for all the rest .",
    "the disadvantage of the pm code is that we needed to use a rigid halo .",
    "therefore in run l1 we used a lower mass resolution live - halo simulation run with pkdgrav ( stadel 2001 ) , a multi - stepping , parallel treecode .",
    "the live - halo model was built using the technique developed by hernquist ( 1993 ; see also springel & white 1999 ) .",
    "we start with an isotropic nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) with virial radius , @xmath76 , circular velocity at the virial radius , @xmath77  and virial mass @xmath78",
    ". then adiabatic contraction of the halo due to the presence of the disk is taken into account assuming that the spherical symmetry of the halo is retained and that the angular momentum of individual dark matter orbits is conserved ( see springel & white 1999 ) .",
    "the disk mass fraction relative to the halo virial mass , @xmath79 .",
    "we used an exponential disk with scale - length @xmath80  and a @xmath81 vertical profile .",
    "we set @xmath82 and softening length @xmath83 .",
    "the velocity field of the disk was calculated as in springel & white ( 1999 ) assuming the radial and vertical velocity dispersions are equal , @xmath84 , with @xmath85 chosen to give minimum toomre-@xmath86 .",
    "then the azimuthal velocity dispersion is determined from @xmath85 using the epicyclic approximation .",
    "the evolution of model b1 has been described in debattista ( 2003 ) , while runs b2 and b3 formed part of the preliminary survey for the milky way modeling described in bissantz  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the evolution of most of the remaining models will be described elsewhere ( debattista  2005 in progress ) .",
    "here we are interested primarily in the final systems not in details of their evolution . except for run r3 , which formed only a very weak oval distortion , all these simulations formed bars .",
    "the edge - on view of the simulations r1-r8 is presented in figure [ fig : peanuts ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a convention where the bar is along the @xmath87-axis and the @xmath21-axis is perpendicular to the disk .",
    "runs r1-r4 contain prominent peanuts which were produced by bending instabilities ( raha 1991 ; merritt & sellwood 1994 ) .",
    "to better present these peanuts , in figure [ fig : pntslice ] we present the edge - on projected density of particles in the narrow range @xmath88 ,  we show only a narrow slice of each model extending to about the minor - axis of the bar .",
    "this gives a better appreciation of the peanuts which will be sought in the face - on view , where the disks do not mask peanuts .",
    "peanuts can form in weakly barred systems ( patsis  2002 ) ; the peanut in run r3 formed in the presence of only a very weak oval . as a result ,",
    "this peanut is almost axisymmetric .",
    "run r5 contains a weak peanut while runs r6-r8 have no peanuts at all .",
    "run r8 is identical to run r1 except for one important detail : we forced symmetry about the mid - plane .",
    "therefore , although the velocity ellipsoid is very anisotropic with @xmath89 through most of the bar , the system could not bend and did not develop a peanut .    comparing the peanuts visible in figures [ fig : peanuts ] and [ fig : pntslice ] with the bars seen in the face - on surface density overlaid on figure [ fig : heights ] ,",
    "it is apparent that the peanut in run r1 is smaller then the bar .",
    "kormendy and kennicutt ( 2004 ) noted that the peanut in the moderately inclined galaxy ngc 7582 was significantly shorter than the bar , and worried that this may be a problem for a secular peanut formation scenario .",
    "run r1 shows that peanuts need not fill the entire major axis of a bar . in contrast , the peanut in run r2 extends to about the ends of the bar .",
    "figure [ fig : heights ] shows maps of @xmath10 for runs r1-r8 . on the bar s major axis",
    "@xmath10 increases radially outwards , reaching a maximum when a peanut is present . in most cases ,",
    "the local maximum in @xmath10 occurs close to the peanut . on the other hand , in runs r6-r8 ,",
    "none of which contain a peanut , @xmath10 increases throughout .",
    "the maps in figure [ fig : z4 ] show @xmath9 for runs r1-r8 .",
    "minima in @xmath9 correlate well with the location of peanuts and there are no significant minima in @xmath9 other than at @xmath90 in the absence of a peanut .    for better comparison of the different models , figure [ fig : photmjraxis ]",
    "shows the density , @xmath10 and @xmath9 profiles along the major axes of the face - on bars .",
    "are the second and fourth density moments equivalent ways of defining the peanut ?",
    "figure [ fig : photmjraxis ] shows that the maxima in @xmath10 corresponds very well to the minima in @xmath9 in runs r1 and r2 . in run",
    "r3 the peak of @xmath10 is at a different radius from the minimum of @xmath9 , while in run r4 @xmath10 and @xmath9 have _ maxima _ at about the same point .",
    "thus the maximum in @xmath10 and the minimum in @xmath9 are not equivalent ways of defining the peanut .    which of @xmath10 and @xmath9 is the better tracer of peanuts ?",
    "figure [ fig : photmjraxis ] shows that the major - axis @xmath10 profiles of runs r1 and r5 are rather similar , suggesting very similar peanuts ; figures [ fig : peanuts ] and [ fig : pntslice ] show that this is far from being the case .",
    "in contrast , their @xmath9 profiles in figure [ fig : photmjraxis ] are very different . for this reason",
    "@xmath9 is a better measure of the presence and strength of a peanut .",
    "the reason why @xmath10 is not an optimal peanut diagnostic is that it is partly determined by the local projected density , as suggested by the correlation , evident in figure [ fig : photmjraxis ] , between the depth of the central minimum in @xmath10 and the central concentration .",
    "figure [ fig : sigz ] shows maps of @xmath11 for runs r1-r8 .",
    "no sign of the peanuts is evident in these maps .",
    "we found that , in the region @xmath91 of all the models , @xmath11 correlates very strongly with @xmath13 , even off the bar s major axis .",
    "the signature of a peanut is buried in the small scatter in @xmath11 at fixed @xmath13 , making the peanut hard to distinguish from @xmath11 .      following the discussion in section [ sec :",
    "exact ] , it is unsurprising that we can not identify peanuts from @xmath11 profiles . since @xmath93 in the isothermal disk ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : z0 ] ) , it is worth exploring whether @xmath92 is better than @xmath11 at locating peanuts . in figure",
    "[ fig : kinemjraxis ] we plot , for runs r1-r8 , @xmath92 on the bars major - axes . in all cases ,",
    "the profiles of @xmath94 are rather similar to those of @xmath10 ( although there is not a one - to - one correspondence ) .",
    "however , a comparison of figures [ fig : photmjraxis ] and [ fig : kinemjraxis ] shows that the minimum in @xmath9 , which we showed above to be a good indicator of a peanut , does not correspond to any special point in the @xmath92 profile .",
    "therefore @xmath92 has the same limitations as a peanut diagnostic as @xmath10 , although it may still be useful in distinguishing between peanut and peanutless systems .",
    "figure [ fig : h4 ] plots @xmath0 for runs r1-r8 .",
    "a qualitative difference between the peanut systems and the peanutless ones is evident  two negative minima at the location of the peanut on the bar s major axis if a peanut is present . in runs",
    "r1-r4 there is a considerable variation in bar strength , but in each case , the negative @xmath0 minimum criterion recognizes the peanut , demonstrating that it does not depend on bar strength .    in run r5 , which produced a weak peanut ,",
    "@xmath0 remains greater than zero on the bar major - axis and the only minimum is at @xmath90 .",
    "thus the kinematic diagnostic can not identify weak peanuts .",
    "other than at @xmath90 , no significantly negative minimum in @xmath0 occurs in runs r6-r8 which lack a peanut .",
    "figure [ fig : h4vsz4 ] plots @xmath0 versus @xmath9 on the major axes of the bars . as predicted by the analytic models of section [ sec : exact ] , the minimum in @xmath9 , which is a tracer of the peanut , corresponds to the minimum of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore minima in @xmath0 are an excellent kinematic peanut diagnostic in these face - on systems .",
    "mainly because of the lower mass resolution , which results in significantly lower @xmath95 in the gauss - hermite moments , we used the live - halo run l1 only to confirm results of the rigid - halo simulations . despite the lower @xmath95",
    ", we were still able to identify clear and well - matched minima in @xmath9 and @xmath0 in the region of the peanut .",
    "indeed the properties of the peanut in l1 are very similar to those in run r1 although the initial conditions , including vertical structure , were quite different .",
    "this gives us confidence that the peanut diagnostic developed from rigid - halo simulations is not an artifact of the rigid halos .",
    "now we consider simulations which include a bulge in the initial conditions . in figure",
    "[ fig : bulges ] we plot the edge - on views of these systems .",
    "a weak peanut is present in run b1 , which is masked in the full edge - on view .",
    "a stronger peanut is present in run b2 and an even stronger one in b3 . comparing with figures [ fig : peanuts ] and [ fig : pntslice ] ,",
    "the pure disk components of runs b1 , b2 and b3 are most like runs r5 , r4 and r1 respectively , albeit only approximately .",
    "figure [ fig : bulgemaps ] plots maps of @xmath9 and @xmath0 and the major axis profiles are presented in figure [ fig : bulgpprof ] . in all three runs ,",
    "the slope of the profile of @xmath10 has a break which allows the peanut to be recognized .",
    "thus the peanuts are still evident in @xmath92 , including again the weak peanut in b1 .",
    "all three models have minima in their @xmath9 profiles , but those in runs b1 and b2 are broad ones extending down to @xmath90 . in @xmath0 ,",
    "no minima are visible in run b1 ( and thus no peanut is identified , as was the case also for the weak peanut in run r5 ) , while the usual minima identifying a peanut are clear in run b3 .",
    "the case of run b2 is more interesting .",
    "if the bulge in this system were dark , a peanut would stand out clearly in @xmath0 ( cyan line ) ; with the addition of the bulge , the different bulge kinematics , especially the significantly higher @xmath11 , perturb the net @xmath0 , hiding the presence of a peanut in the sense that only a single broad minimum down to @xmath90 remains in its profile .",
    "exactly face - on galaxies are rare ; the probability for a galaxy to be within @xmath96 of edge - on is over 20 times larger than for it to be within @xmath96 of face - on ( @xmath97 versus @xmath98 ) .",
    "the inclination needs to be within @xmath99 of face - on before its probability is equal to that for @xmath96 from edge - on .",
    "a sample of exactly face - on galaxies may therefore be hard to obtain .",
    "thus it is necessary to ask what happens to the kinematic signature of a peanut when it is viewed not quite perfectly face - on .",
    "is it possible that the negative minimum in @xmath0 signature of a peanut is erased , or induced where no peanut is present , for other than an exactly face - on orientation ?",
    "once a system is no longer perfectly face - on , the observed los velocity dispersion , @xmath100 , relative to which @xmath0 is defined , includes contributions from the radial ( @xmath85 ) and tangential ( @xmath101 ) dispersion components .",
    "if @xmath102 is the inclination angle , @xmath103 is any angle in the disk s plane measured relative to the inclination axis , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , then the contribution of @xmath11 to @xmath100 is @xmath106 this has a maximum along the disk s major axis ( @xmath107 ) and a minimum on the minor axis ( @xmath108 ) . a crude estimate of @xmath109 can be obtained assuming that @xmath110 (  a flat rotation curve ) . then if @xmath111 ( the minimum value required for stability [ araki 1985 ] ) , we estimate that the contamination may be as high as @xmath112 already at an inclination of @xmath113",
    "however , @xmath111 is extreme : in the solar neighborhood , dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) find @xmath114 while gerssen  ( 2000 ) find even larger @xmath115 in earlier hubble types .",
    "the contamination of @xmath11 in @xmath100 is still less than @xmath112 at @xmath116 on the disk s major axis if @xmath117 .",
    "since these estimates are based on simplifying approximations , we also explored the effect of inclination directly on the @xmath1-body simulations to @xmath118 .",
    "figure [ fig : inclined ] , presents @xmath0 on the bar major - axis for runs r1-r8 inclined at @xmath116 and with the bar oriented at @xmath119 .    for strong peanuts",
    ", the negative @xmath0 minimum criterion still distinguishes between peanut and peanutless systems up to an inclination of @xmath8 .",
    "when a peanut is present , the two minima on opposite sides of the bar become asymmetric as @xmath103 increases to @xmath120 .",
    "therefore @xmath121 , is a more favorable orientation for finding peanuts . in some instances",
    ", inclination produces negative minima in @xmath0 off the bar s major axis in both peanut and peanutless systems .",
    "however , inclination leads to , at most , only shallow minima in peanutless systems , although an overall negative @xmath0 can result when no peanut is present .",
    "( thus a negative @xmath0 without a minimum is not by itself sufficient as a peanut diagnostic . )    in run r8 we prevented bending by forcing mid - plane symmetry , which resulted in a final @xmath89 .",
    "when this system is viewed at an inclination of @xmath122 , two _ shallow _ minima in @xmath0 appear at all @xmath103 ( see figure [ fig : inclined ] ) even though no peanut is present .",
    "as expected from the analytic estimate above , inclination has a much larger effect on the vertical kinematic moments of vertically cold systems . as this is an unrealistically anisotropic system ( symmetrization about the disk plane having inhibited the bending instability ) , this simulation represents an extreme extent to which inclination introduces minima in @xmath0 when no peanut is present .",
    "two animations accompany the online version of this paper .",
    "these show the effect of inclination on the @xmath0 moments of simulations b1 and b3 .",
    "measuring kinematic gauss - hermite moments requires high @xmath95 spectra ( bender  1994 ) . in our @xmath1-body measurements ,",
    "this has been possible because of the large number of particles . by resampling experiments",
    ", we determined that a @xmath123 is required to measure @xmath0 sufficiently accurately to identify a peanut , in good agreement with bender  ( 1994 ) .",
    "fortunately bars are generally bright features which helps improve the @xmath95 .",
    "the kinematic signature of a peanut is strong for some distance on the bar s minor - axis ( figure [ fig : h4 ] ) .",
    "thus very precise placement of the slit along the bar s major axis is not necessary .",
    "this also allows the widest slit consistent with the necessary spectral resolution .",
    "the spectral resolution , r , required depends on the value of @xmath11 which varies from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the milky way has @xmath124  ( kuijken 2003 ) .",
    "thus one would need r @xmath125 to find a peanut in a face - on galaxy like the milky way .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath126  (  bottema 1993 ) , r @xmath127 would be needed .",
    "b / p - shaped bulges are common in edge - on disks and simulations show that these can form by secular evolution in barred galaxies . in this paper",
    "we explored the signature of peanuts on the vertical density and the resulting kinematics .",
    "we showed that both @xmath10 and @xmath9 are affected by a peanut , but the two are not equivalent signatures of a peanut .",
    "the preferred peanut signifier is @xmath9 since it distinguishes between weak and strong peanuts .    the vertical velocity dispersion",
    ", @xmath11 is a poor diagnostic for peanuts because it depends on the local density .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 , which in an isothermal disk would trace @xmath10 , factors out some of this dependence and is able to identify peanuts , even weak ones , at breaks in its slope .",
    "however it is unable to quantify peanut strength and correlates poorly with @xmath9 .",
    "this parameter may also be prone to systematic effects from variations in mass - to - light ratios if , for example , the bulge and the disk are composed of different stellar populations , as would happen if the bulge formed at high redshift through mergers .",
    "nevertheless , this is a useful peanut diagnostic that is worth testing in real galaxies .",
    "an excellent kinematic diagnostic of face - on peanuts are negative double minima in the gauss - hermite moment @xmath0 .",
    "the negative @xmath0 minimum signature of a peanut holds for any bar strength down to the weakest of ovals and may therefore be used to search also for peanuts in unbarred galaxies .",
    "this diagnostic is not too sensitive to inclination for @xmath128 , with negative minima on a bar s major - axis continuing to be associated with the presence of a peanut .",
    "however , inclination leads to an asymmetry between the two sides of the bar as the bar orientation approaches the minor axis .",
    "thus a bar oriented within @xmath129 of the line - of - nodes is ideal for a peanut search .",
    "two competing models of bulge formation  via internal secular evolution and via external drivers  each account for a significant body of observational evidence , suggesting that both processes play some role (  wyse 2004 ) .",
    "thus we need to ask which process dominates in which galaxies .",
    "the results here suggest a novel observational program to address this question by targeting the degree of decoupling of the vertical structure of bulges and bars . to be concrete , consider runs r4 and b2 , both of which contain a peanut .",
    "since the bulge is already present in the initial conditions in run b2 ( as would be a bulge formed in an early merger ) , the presence of a peanut can not be used to address whether the bulge formed by secular evolution or not .",
    "photometrically the two have similar density profiles ( figure [ fig : compbulgedisk ] ) since run r1 acquired a central density concentration by secular evolution ( hohl 1971 ; debattista  2004 ) .",
    "these profiles are typical of the major - axis profiles of real galaxies : the dashed line in this figure shows the @xmath130-band profile of the nearly face - on galaxy ngc 4477 , taken from the onlinefrei / catalog.htm ] frei catalog of galaxies ( frei  1996 ) .",
    "however the vertical structure of the bulge in run b2 is qualitatively different from that in run r1 because it is not derived from the disk s .",
    "because of this , neither the @xmath9 nor the @xmath0 profiles have the kind of separated minima associated with peanuts in which the central concentration forms purely by secular evolution .",
    "peanuts have been shown to be visible in @xmath131 of edge - on galaxies which means that they are even more common since projection hides some fraction of peanuts .",
    "thus a kinematic survey of face - on barred galaxies should turn up a large fraction of galaxies with the negative @xmath0 minima signature of a peanut if bulges are built largely by secular evolution of bars . on the other hand , if bulges formed largely through mergers of dwarfs then peanuts would need to be stronger to be identifiable in face - on kinematics .",
    "the simulations presented here were all collisionless .",
    "if gas funneled by a bar plays an important role also in bulge formation , naively it would seem likely that the vertical kinematic signature of a peanut becomes confused .",
    "however , in a barred potential , gas sinks to small radii where its kinematics and of stars formed from it do not perturb those from the peanut further out .",
    "lower resolution hydro+@xmath1-body live - halo experiments we have run and which will be presented elsewhere show that peanuts can still be recognized in that case with the same stellar kinematic diagnostic .",
    "therefore an observational survey of face - on barred galaxies to look for peanuts appears worth undertaking .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for comments which helped improve the presentation of this paper .",
    "thanks enrico maria corsini , sven de rijcke and ortwin gerhard for fruitful discussion ."
