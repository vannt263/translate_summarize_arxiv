    "graham , kaplan and rajendran recently proposed a radical solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem by the dynamics of a scalar field  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea had been proposed in the context of the cosmological constant problem  @xcite . during inflation  @xcite",
    ", the axion - like scalar field called the relaxion @xmath3 slowly rolls down the potential and reduces , with the coupling to the standard model ( sm ) higgs field @xmath4 , the effective higgs mass term from a huge positive value with the relaxion - higgs coupling , @xmath5 .",
    "the higgs field is expected to have the cut - off scale size mass term @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the cutoff scale of the theory .",
    "when the relaxion field goes across the field value @xmath8 and the effective higgs mass slightly becomes tachyonic , the electroweak symmetry breaking takes place .",
    "the relaxion field is fixed by a non - perturbative effect induced potential at @xmath9 , that stabilizes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the mass of the electroweak scale for the sm higgs field . as a result of the substantial cancellation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the sm higgs mass term ,",
    "the lower electroweak scale compared to the cut off scale @xmath7 can be realized .    since the proposal  @xcite , some aspects of the relaxion scenario and various extended models have been studied  @xcite . for instance , the origin of non - perturbative terms  @xcite , fine - tuning  @xcite , supersymmetric extension  @xcite , the issue of large excursion of relaxion field  @xcite have been considered .    in this paper , in the context of the original relaxion model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we examine a consistent parameter region from a cosmological viewpoint .",
    "namely , we examine the dynamics of original models during and after inflation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ review ] , we briefly review the outline of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section  [ qcd ]",
    ", we study inflationary dynamics of the model , introducing the relaxion - inflaton coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that with this coupling , the qcd axion can serve the relaxion , evading the strong cp problem in the sm if parameters are appropriately taken .",
    "we examine this possibility with a special attention to the sign of each term in the scalar potential , which may not be very clear in the original paper  @xcite . in section  [ nonqcd ] ,",
    "we study dynamics of relaxion and higgs transition during inflation and calculate the relic abundance of relaxion generated as coherent oscillation .",
    "we discuss the conditions that the relaxion transition does not disturb the inflationary cosmic expansion and show that these conditions constrain the parameter space of the relaxion .",
    "we also find that this abundance does not exceed the dark matter ( dm ) abundance if a relaxion potential height is low enough or inflation continues during certain number of @xmath12-fold after the relaxion stabilization . from the experimental search limit for axion - like particles ( alps ) and the consistency of the scenario",
    ", we discuss the viable parameter space of relaxion model and summarize it in plots of the relaxion mass and coupling plane .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "here , we briefly describe the outline of relaxion mechanism based on the original minimal scenario proposed in ref .",
    "the model contains three scalar fields ; the sm higgs @xmath4 , the relaxion @xmath3 and the inflaton @xmath13 . the scalar potential for @xmath4 and @xmath3 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a soft - breaking parameter of the periodic shift symmetry of the relaxion @xmath3 . here",
    ", we also wrote the higgs self - interaction term with the coupling @xmath16 which was omitted in ref .",
    "since the effective mass term should be positive before the symmetry breaking , the initial value of @xmath3 should be chosen such that @xmath17 . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the mass term vanishes and afterwards the higgs field becomes tachyonic .",
    "then , the higgs field develops a non - vanishing vev . to make this possible , we need to choose the sign of the last term as in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "for example , when we choose the mass term as @xmath19 , the initial value of @xmath3 should be largely positive with @xmath20 .",
    "this requires the sign of the last term to be positive , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "we will find that the symmetry breaking does not take place during the slow - roll inflation in the other choice with @xmath22 .    once @xmath4 starts to take a non - vanishing field value , the relaxion field acquires a periodic potential @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the relaxion decay constant , induced by non - perturbative effects in a strong interaction @xmath25 where @xmath26 is its gauge coupling and , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the field strength and its dual respectively .",
    "if we identify this strong interaction with the sm qcd , the height of the potential @xmath29 is proportional to the vev of the higgs field , i.e. , @xmath30 when we explicitly show its @xmath4 dependence , we express it as @xmath31 with @xmath32 gev .    with a certain choice of the initial condition of @xmath3 ,",
    "the effective higgs mass squared @xmath33 stays positive at an early stage of inflation . during inflation",
    ", @xmath3 slowly rolls down the potential .",
    "when @xmath3 passes the field value @xmath8 , the effective higgs mass becomes tachyonic and finally it can be settled down at a scale which is much smaller than the cutoff scale @xmath7 .",
    "this is the mechanism to realize the small weak scale , starting from the cutoff scale . as the vev of the higgs field increases , the height of the cosine potential increases and @xmath34 becomes more important ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda - phi ] ) ) .",
    "the relaxion stops rolling down the potential , when the gradient of the potential @xmath35 becomes comparable to the one of @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath36 . solving the stationary condition for the total potential @xmath37 , we can estimate ( the order of ) the final value of the relaxion as   dependence of @xmath38 through the vev of the higgs field . ]",
    "@xmath39 this implies that the @xmath40 parameter , given by @xmath41 , is of order unity and leaves the strong cp problem unsolved .",
    "therefore , in this minimum setup , we can not identify @xmath3 with the qcd axion . in order to circumvent the difficulty , in ref .",
    "@xcite , two possible scenarios were considered : an introduction of a relaxion - inflaton coupling and a non - qcd axion . in the following two sections ,",
    "we discuss dynamics and constraints for both the qcd relaxion and a non - qcd based model .",
    "in this section , we discuss the time evolution of the coupled system with the sm higgs @xmath4 , the relaxion field @xmath3 , and the inflaton @xmath13 during inflation .",
    "we postulate the ansatz of the total scalar potential as @xmath42 where additionally we introduced the coupling between the inflation and the relaxion .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in the previous section .",
    "notice that the sgins of @xmath43 given in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) is same as eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the original paper  @xcite .",
    "as one will see , those signs lead to crucial difference . in our discussion",
    ", we do not specify the inflaton potential .",
    "one may expect that if the effective value of the gradient of the @xmath3 potential , @xmath45 , which should be comparable to @xmath46 until around the relaxion stabilization , is significantly reduced after the stabilization , the relaxion still can be identified with the qcd axion , evading the strong cp problem . to study this possibility ,",
    "the last term in the scalar potential ( [ fullscalarpotential ] ) was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the inflaton potential to be bounded from below",
    ", we assume that @xmath47 takes a positive value .   where @xmath48 is an even number with @xmath49",
    ", we can keep the inflaton potential bounded from below also for @xmath50 . to fulfill the condition @xmath51",
    ", a large field evolution may be preferred .",
    "however , a large field evolution where the @xmath52 term dominates the inflaton potential is strongly disfavored by data of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies  @xcite . ] first , we consider the case where the mass term is given by @xmath53 .",
    "then , the effective slope of the relaxion during inflation is given by @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that during inflation this slope is predominantly sustained by the coupling between the inflaton and the relaxion , i.e. , @xmath55 , which gives the lower bound on the value of @xmath13 as @xmath56 one may naively expect that the relaxion can be stabilized , when the non - perturbative term @xmath34 becomes comparable to the effectively enhanced slope @xmath57 .",
    "then , since the relaxion stabilization does not impose any constraint on @xmath58 , we can choose the value so that the small qcd @xmath40 term can be realized .",
    "however , a little more careful consideration reveals that it is rather difficult to stabilize the relaxion in this setup .",
    "the relaxion @xmath3 is supposed to evolve from a smaller value to a larger value , reducing the effective higgs mass squared from the huge positive value to a negative value . in the presence of the coupling with the inflaton ,",
    "the relaxion potential , given by @xmath59 has the minimum at @xmath60 . using @xmath61",
    ", we find @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , for the relaxion to be settled down at @xmath63 , @xmath3 should overshoot the potential minimum and climb up the potential . this is impossible , since we start with a small kinetic energy of @xmath3 , which leads to the slow - roll evolution .    in order to avoid this problem",
    ", the sign of the terms in the scalar potential should be @xmath64 where the bare higgs mass squared is large",
    "negative and @xmath3 evolves from a large positive to negative .",
    "thus , the introduction of the @xmath65 lets the qcd axion play the role of the relaxion , only if the sign of the terms are appropriately chosen .",
    "in this section , we study availability of parameter region without @xmath65 term for simplicity and generality .",
    "the dynamical scale is given by @xmath66 .",
    "also extra matter fields , which couple with the higgs field @xmath4 , are required in order to have a @xmath4-dependence in such a potential like ( [ eq : lambda - phi ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we derive a condition that the relaxion is stabilized at @xmath67 . until the time @xmath68 when the relaxion passes the field value @xmath69 and the higgs field acquires the tachyonic mass at the origin , @xmath3 and @xmath13 slowly rolls down the potential . under the slow - roll approximation ,",
    "the field equations are given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the reduced planck mass , @xmath72 gev .",
    "we assume that the transition at @xmath73 does not disturb the inflationary dynamics , imposing @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{cond : smoothinflation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath75 denotes the hubble parameter for @xmath76 and @xmath77 denotes the one for @xmath78 .",
    "if one of those conditions is violated , the scenario suffers from either too strong temperature effect or too abundant relaxion energy density , as we will show in the next subsection .",
    "after @xmath73 , the relaxion is not necessarily in the slow roll phase anymore and the field equations for @xmath4 and @xmath3 are given by @xmath79 the potential for the relaxion is now given by @xmath80 the values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 at a local minimum , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , can be determined by solving @xmath83 when the strong dynamical scale is smaller than the weak scale , i.e. , @xmath84 , we can further rewrite these conditions as @xmath85 and obtain the resultant minimum field values as @xmath86 and @xmath87 where ( [ min : vphi_inf1 ] ) and ( [ min : vphi_inf2 ] ) are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ stat : h ] ) with @xmath88 and ( [ stat : phi ] ) , respectively . the final value of @xmath89 is expected to be @xmath90 to reproduce the observed fermi constant .",
    "we find that , from eqs .",
    "( [ stat : phi ] ) , ( [ min : vh_inf ] ) and ( [ min : vphi_inf2 ] ) , the condition for relaxion potential has a local minimum is @xmath91 the effective mass matrix for the higgs boson and relaxion is given as @xmath92 if @xmath93 holds , the relaxion - like direction can be stabilized during inflation .",
    "this condition requires that the relaxion should be stabilized kinematically and has not been discussed elsewhere  . when eq .",
    "( [ stat : phi ] ) is fulfilled , the mass matrix can be rewritten as @xmath94 and the higgs - relaxion mixing is given by @xmath95      the relaxion starts to oscillate around the local minimum @xmath96 with the initial amplitude @xmath97 at @xmath98 during inflation .",
    "when the potential of the relaxion expanded around @xmath96 is ( approximately ) quadratic , the energy density of the relaxion at the end of inflation is given by @xmath99 after the reheating by inflaton decay , the ratio between the energy density of the relaxion and the entropy is given by @xmath100 where we assumed that the energy density of the oscillating inflaton decreases as @xmath101 . here , we used @xmath102 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath103 when the lifetime of @xmath3 is longer than the age of our universe , @xmath104 should not exceed the present dark matter density @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological dark matter abundance constrain model parameters as @xmath106 if this constraint is barely satisfied , then the relaxion plays a role of dark matter .",
    "this is realized if @xmath107 is non - negligible or a value inside the bracket is very small , namely @xmath108 .",
    "for this relaxion mechanism to work , we need to keep the relaxion and the higgs field stabilized at the minimum after inflation .",
    "in particular , for the higgs field , the temperature of the thermal plasma should not be higher than of the weak scale @xmath109 . during the period between the end of inflation and the completion of reheating",
    ", the radiation has been generated by a partial decay of the inflaton @xmath13 and the temperature is given by  @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the reheating temperature , which has to be higher than a few mev for a successful big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "thus , the maximum temperature after inflation is estimated as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the hubble parameter at the end of inflation . in order for the thermal effect not to take the higgs field back to the origin , one may impose @xmath114 otherwise , the relaxion can be destabilized and the tachyonic effective higgs mass term can become negatively too large .",
    "one should notice , however , this condition implies that the sphaleron processes has been never activated after inflation .",
    "this is also a serious trouble in the relaxion scenario from the viewpoint of baryogenesis .      in literature",
    ", the constraints on alps have been displayed on the mass - coupling plane .",
    "a relevant coupling is the photon - alps coupling normalized as @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 denote the field strength and its dual of the electromagnetic field .    in the relaxion model",
    ", another @xmath118 interaction is induced through the higgs - relaxion mixing with the angle ( [ mix : h - phi ] ) .",
    "this imposes a constraint on the mixing angle , which is proportional to @xmath119 . in the rest of analysis",
    ", we will assume this condition is satisfied .",
    "the conditions to realize successful inflation and not to destabilize the relaxion field are expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ cond : smoothinflation ] ) and ( [ cond : axion_stabil2]).experimental limits for alps search results are read for @xmath120 .    since constraints on the relaxion relic abundance ( [ cond : omegah2-phi ] ) and reheating temperature ( [ cond : tmaxbound ] ) depends on not only the relaxion mass @xmath121 and decay constant @xmath24 but also @xmath111 and @xmath107 , eqs .",
    "( [ cond : omegah2-phi ] ) and ( [ cond : tmaxbound ] ) can be satisfied by those other parameters .",

    "that looks hardly possible . as @xmath136 increases , the new dynamical scale increases . as in its right panel , for example for @xmath138 ev , the strong scale can lie @xmath139 gev @xmath140 tev .",

    "we have re - examined the cosmological constraints on the original relaxion scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we gave a caveat that depending on the sign of the terms in the scalar potential , the qcd axion can not play the role of the relaxion even if there exists the coupling between the inflaton and the relaxion .",
    "second , we have shown that the relic abundance of relaxion generated by the misalignment mechanism does not exceed the present dark matter density for sufficiently large values of @xmath107 or small potential height @xmath142 .",
    "third , we derived `` the relaxion window '' of the cosmologically consistent mass and the coupling to the photon .",
    "namely , we obtained @xmath0 ev @xmath1 ev and @xmath143 .",
    "the lower bound comes from the condition to stabilize the relaxion at a suitable vacuum with the higgs field vev and its mass of the weak scale .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath136 , in other words @xmath121 , and the scale of strong dynamics @xmath2 . for higher mass ,",
    "larger scale @xmath2 of non - qcd strong dynamics becomes available .",
    "while for a low mass and larger @xmath144 , @xmath2 of non - qcd strong dynamics should be small and we need to construct a tricky model where non - qcd fermions are still somehow coupled with the sm higgs field to generate the non - perturbative potential with the sm higgs dependence . this is indeed challenging .",
    "another remaining issue is to build an inflation model which generates the observed primordial density perturbation .",
    "in addition , the electroweak symmetry is assumed not to be recovered after inflation in the relaxion scenario .",
    "since the electroweak sphaleron mechanism has never been active , it is necessary to contrive a viable baryogenesis mechanism .",
