    "the x - ray source 4u 1907@xmath409 is an accretion powered x - ray pulsar accreting plasma from a blue supergiant companion star . since its discovery in the uhuru survey ( giacconi et al .",
    "1971 ) , it has been observed by various x - ray observatories including ariel v ( marshall & ricketts 1980 ) , tenma ( makishima et al . 1984 ) , exosat ( cook & page 1987 ) , ginga ( makishima & mihara 1992 ; mihara 1995 ) , bepposax ( cusumano et al . 1998 ) , xmpc ( chitnis et al . 1993 ) , ixae ( mukerjee at al.2001 ) and rxte ( int zand , baykal & strohmayer 1998a ; int zand , strohmayer & baykal 1997 , 1998b ; roberts et al . 2001",
    "; baykal et al .",
    "marshall & ricketts ( 1980 ) determined the orbital period to be 8.38d using ariel v observations .",
    "they also found two flares , namely a primary and a secondary * occuring near periastron and apastron * , and exosat and rxte observations ( int zand et al .",
    "1998a , b ) have clearly shown that these flares are locked to orbital phases separated by half an orbital period .",
    "using tenma observations , makishima et al .",
    "( 1984 ) also found the pulse period of the source to be 437.5 sec .",
    "makishima et al . ( 1984 ) and cook & page ( 1987 ) discussed the possibility that the two flares are caused by an equatorial disc - like envelope ( circumstellar disc ) around the companion star .",
    "when the neutron star crosses the disc , the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star increases temporarily .",
    "we expect to see two peaks while the neutron star passes twice through the circumstellar disc of the companion star in every cycle .",
    "we also expect a transient accretion disc formation around the neutron star while the neutron star passes through this circumstellar disc . for the formation of the circumstellar disc around the companion star , the companion must most likely be a be type star .",
    "recent optical observations showed that the optical companion of 4u 1907@xmath409 is an o8/o9 supergiant with a dense stellar wind ( cox , kaper , mokiem 2005 ) .",
    "formation of a transient accretion disc around the neutron star as a result of disruption of the dense stellar wind of a massive companion is quite possible as well ( blondin et al . 1990 ) .    the timing measurements from exosat ( cook & page 1987 ) and rxte observations ( int zand et al .",
    "1998a , b ; baykal et al .",
    "2001 ) showed continuous spin down of the neutron star.the source was found to be spinning down almost at a rate of @xmath5 for more than 15 years ( baykal et al .",
    "timing analysis of rxte ( int zand et al .",
    "1998 ) and ixae ( mukerjee et al . 2001 ) observations of 4u 1907 - 09 also revealed transient oscillations with periods of about 18.2s and 14.4s respectively .",
    "these transient oscillations * were * suggested to be related to the presence of a transient retrograde accretion disc which is also responsible for the slowing down of the pulsar .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of timing and spectral studies of archival rxte - pca observations of 4u 1907 + 09 , and report a change in the spin down rate of this system .",
    "the proportional counter array ( pca)(jahoda et al.1996 ) on board the rxte consists of five identical proportional counter units ( pcus ) coaligned to the same point in the sky , with a total effective area of approximately 6250 @xmath6 , and a field of view of @xmath7 fwhm , operating in the 2 - 60 kev energy range .",
    "the number of active pcus is varied between one and five during the observations.observations after 2000 may 13 belong to the observational epoch for which background level for one of the pcus ( pcu0 ) increased due to the fact that this pcu started to operate without a propane layer .",
    "latest combined background models ( cms ) were used together with ftools 6.0 to estimate the appropriate background .",
    "the rxte - pca observations used in this work are listed in table 1 .",
    ".observation list for 4u 1907 + 09 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the spin - down rate of 4u 1907 + 09 obtained from the pulse arrival times between march 2001 and march 2002 was found to be @xmath2 0.60 times lower than both the previous rxte measurements of spin - down rate between november 1996 - december 1997 by baykal et al . , ( 2001 ) and the long term spin down trend of the source between 1983 and 1997 ( see figure 1 in baykal et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this and the previous rxte observations ,",
    "time span of the observations were similar ( @xmath8 over year ) and in both observations posses low timing noise",
    ". however spin down rate is lowered by a factor of 0.6 in latter observations .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the spin - down rate is consistent with zero around mjd 51000 before this significant change in spin - down rate .",
    "our pulse frequency measurements for the first time resolved significant spin - down rate variations since the discovery of the source .    the steady spin - down rate ( baykal et al . 2001 ) and the presence of occasional transient oscillations ( int zand et al .",
    "1998a ; mukerjee et al .",
    "2001 ) in 4u 1907 + 09 support the idea that the source accretes from retrograde transient accretion disc .",
    "the possibility of a prograde disc for which the magnetospheric radius should be close to the corotation radius so that the magnetic torque overcomes material torque is not likely to be the case for this system ( int zand et al .",
    "if the disc is retrograde and the material torque is dominant , using ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) accretion disc model , a decrease in spin - down rate of the neutron star should be a sign of a decrease in the mass accretion rate coming from the accretion disc . if the disc accretion is the only accretion mechanism , this decrease in mass accretion rate should also lead to a decrease in x - ray flux of the system .    from the x - ray spectral analysis of the source , we found no clear evidence of a correlation between 3 - 25 kev flux and the change in spin - down rate ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the flux levels were about the same for latter observations with low spin - down rate compared to the rest of the observations .",
    "this was not our expectation if we only consider disc accretion and may be because of the fact that the total mass accretion rate is not only due to only disc accretion , but also accretion from stellar wind may contribute to the total mass accretion rate ( see also roberts et al .",
    "2001 ) . in case of accretion from both transient disc and wind , the change in mass accretion rate from the accretion disc might not cause a substantial change in x - ray flux",
    "however , it is important to note that the orbital coverage of the latter ( proposal i d 60061 ) observations is poor and limited to the phase locked flares in orbital phases @xmath9 and @xmath10 as seen in figure 3 .",
    "future observations of the source may be helpful to have a better understanding of a possible relation between spin - down rate and x - ray flux .",
    "examining spectral parameters plotted in figure 3 especially for flare parts , we also found an evidence of an increase in hydrogen column density ( @xmath11 ) for the latter observation with lower spin - down rate . on the other hand",
    ", there is no clear evidence of a variation of the other spectral parameters in the flares after the spin - down rate decreased .",
    "change in @xmath11 may be related to a change in the accretion geometry of the source . however",
    ", if there had been an accretion geometry change accompanied with the change in the spin - down rate of the source , we would expect other spectral parameters to vary as well , especially the power law index as in the rxte observations of sax j2103.5 + 4545 ( baykal et al .",
    "2002 ) , and 2s 1417 - 62 ( inam et al . 2004 ) .",
    "new x - ray observations of the source will be useful to monitor any possible changes in the spin - down rate and its consequences .",
