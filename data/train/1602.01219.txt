    "we nominally adopt the former ( hereafter  conservative \" snre ) estimate in our disk geometry analysis (  4.1 ) and use the latter ( hereafter  optimistic \" snre ) as our starting point for our disk scattered light forward - modeling (  4.2 ) , although these choices does not consequentially affect our results .",
    "to derive the hd 141569a inner disk geometry , we follow the same approach used for analyzing hd 115600 s disk @xcite .",
    "first , we derive the disk s basic geometry from ellipse fitting .",
    "second , we use forward - modeling to fine - tune these properties and calculate second - order properties of the disk ( e.g. scattering function ) , assuming that we are seeing optically - thin , scattered light emission .",
    "we focus our analysis on the higher - quality keck / nirc2 data .      from the idl _ mpfitellipse _ package we first define a trace of the disk , where the pixels are weighted by their conservative snre .",
    "second , we constructed a grid of ellipse parameters around the best - fit set determined by , calculating a value using the  maximum merit \" procedure @xcite .",
    "we repeat this step using different ranges in radii and different cutoffs in snre for the disk trace ( e.g. snr @xmath24 3 , 5 ; @xmath10 = 02505 , 025055 ) to define best - estimated values and associated uncertainties .",
    "the disk geometry generally agrees well with the most precise estimates for the outer disks geometry @xcite .",

    "we generate a grid of synthetic scattered light images using grater @xcite and forward - model these synthetic disks through a - loci to compare the processed model disk image with the real disk image @xcite .",
    "table [ diskmodels ] summarizes the model parameter space . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the position angle determined from our ellipse modeling ( -1.2@xmath25 ) .",
    "we consider a nominal inclination of 56@xmath4 and an inclination of 60@xmath4 favored by a subset of our ellipse - fitting results .",
    "we tuned our parameter search to focus on addressing specific questions about the hd 141569a morphology .",
    "first , to assess whether the disk ( made visible by small , scattering dust grains ) coincides with the gas distribution or is radially segregated , we consider photocenters of 36.9 , 39.1 , and 41.3 au ( consistent with our ellipse modeling ) and a photocenter at 25 au : roughly the separation corresponding to the half - maximum of the co gas @xcite .",
    "second , we assess whether the emission originates from a sharp debris ring with a steep drop in density away from the disk photocenter ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 = 10 , -10 ) , the visible edge of a continuous distribution that ( when annealed by processing ) only  appears \" to be truncated ( @xmath27 = 1 ) , or a dust torus ( not a sharp ring ) with an intermediate power law decay at separations interior to the photocenter ( @xmath27 = 2.55 ) ( see augereau et al .",
    "1999 for definitions ) .",
    "we consider power law decays exterior to the disk photocenter of @xmath28 = @xmath29 to @xmath30 , varying , henyey - greenstein scattering parameters @xmath31 ( 00.2 ) , the disk offsets from the star in both x and y , and disk scale heights ( @xmath32 = 35 au ) . to identify the best - fitting disk models",
    ", we closely follow the methods from @xcite .",
    "briefly , we bin down the keck image , the model image , and the noise profile to the keck / nirc2 spatial resolution to compare the data and model at effectively independent data points and compute @xmath33 from the residuals of the binned image over the angular separation where the disk detection is significant and negligibly contaminated by residual speckles ( @xmath10 @xmath2 027055 ) . as noted in  3 , determining a radial noise profile ( and thus a robust snre for the disk ) is extremely difficult due to biasing from the disk and self - subtraction footprints , impeding our ability to quantify a robust estimate of the absolute goodness of fit for the models .",
    "thus , we iteratively rescale the radial noise profile from the  optimistic \" snr map such that the best - fitting model has @xmath34 = 1 and focus simply on the family of best - fitting models : i.e. those fulfilling @xmath33",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 + @xmath37 @xcite , which for our case implies @xmath34 @xmath35 1.124 .",
    "the best - fit model accurately reproduces the disk morphology ( figure [ forwardmodel ] ) and , when subtracted from the keck image , nulls its signal , including the point source - like peak , but leaves the hook - like features largely intact ( snre @xmath2 3.54.5 in the residual image ) .",
    "the integrated signal of the best - fit model is @xmath38 20 mjy . its surface brightness along the major axis ( i.e. the model shown in the top - left panel prior to signal loss from psf subtraction ) ranges from @xmath38 7.5 mag arcsec@xmath39 at the photocenter ( 39 au ) to @xmath38 10 mag arcsec@xmath39 at the widest separations where it is detected robustly ( @xmath10 @xmath2 055 ) .",
    "we can decisively rule out some model phase space and identify key trends .",
    "first , models with a photocenter of @xmath10 = 25 au ( or , by extension , at smaller separations ) are inconsistent with the data , yielding especially high residuals on the south side ( figure [ forwardmodel ] , middle panels ) .",
    "models with @xmath28 = -2.5 are ruled out : the disk requires a sharp density cutoff exterior to the photocenter .",
    "the dust is also likely ( near-)neutral scattering .    while our analysis does not formally preclude models with weak depletion interior to the photocenter ( @xmath27 = 1 ) , even the best - fit of these models ( right panels ) is marginally acceptable , yielding clearly higher residuals .",
    "the @xmath33 distribution for @xmath27 = 2.5  5 is systematically skewed towards smaller values , indicating a better fit : models with these power laws dominate the family of best - fitting solutions .",
    "_ thus , our disk modeling favors a torus of neutral scattering dust at @xmath38 3641 @xmath11 with sharp truncation at larger disk radii and significant depletion at smaller radii .",
    "this material largely lies outside the co gas concentrated at 1125 @xmath11_.      to place limits on the presence of unseen planets that may be perturbing the inner disk , we reprocess the data using aggressive a - loci settings ( e.g. @xmath20 = 0.5 ) .",
    "we determine the throughput loss - corrected radial noise profile @xcite .",
    "the @xcite hot - start evolutionary models allowed us to map between @xmath0 brightness and planet mass .    while previous analysis suggests that hd 141569 a is @xmath2 5 @xmath8 3 myr old , we reinvestigated its age , comparing the hr diagram positions of the primary to @xcite models .",
    "hd 141569 a appears too low in luminosity to be consistent with a 5 myr age .",
    "it s placement on an hr diagram implies an age between 6 myr and the zero - age main sequence ( starting at @xmath38 10 myr ) . for our planet mass limits , we consider the nominal age and an older , revised age of 7.5 myr . at @xmath10",
    "= 02505 ( 2945 au ) , the azimuthally - averaged sensitivity limit is roughly 7.510 @xmath9 ( figure [ planetlimits ] ) , shallow since the disk s bright signal substantially drives up the residual noise estimate . exterior to the inner disk , our sensitivity curve excludes planets with masses of 23.5 @xmath9 ( 34 @xmath9 ) at projected separations of 60120 au assuming an age of 5 ( 7.5 ) @xmath5 .",
    "if the planet luminosity evolution is better described by a cold start model , our mass limits are significantly poorer .",
    "figure [ cartoon ] depicts an updated schematic of the complex hd 141569a circumstellar environment .",
    "the system now includes three scattered light - resolved , concentric rings / torii of material spanning between 25 and 500 @xmath11 , a halo of small dust emission located between the innermost and middle ring , and significant localized structure in the middle and outermost rings plus multiple ( candidate ) spirals / hooks in all three rings indicative of perturbations by stellar / substellar companions ( this work , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interspersed between these dust components are multiple gas reservoirs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inner disk dust and gas are likely not well mixed : dust is concentrated in a torus with a larger radius than the co gas and is likely heavily depleted at smaller separations , implying that its dust cavity is larger than the gas cavity .",
    "recent analysis of alma data by @xcite likewise provides strong evidence for radial segregation of warm dust and gas in transitional disks , with dust cavities up to 3 times larger and an order of magnitude more depleted than gas cavities .",
    "however , the disks they analyzed are generally massive , optically thick in the mid - infrared , and vigorously accreting .",
    "hd 141569 a has weak / negligible accretion , is optically thin in the mid - infrared @xcite , and low mass .",
    "while the heavily depleted dust cavities in canonical transitional disks are consistent with the planet trapping scenario @xcite , hd 141569 a s radially - segregated disk may be shaped by other mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the dimensionless stokes parameter in the epstein drag regime , appropriate for small grains , st @xmath2 @xmath40 ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , is @xmath41 1 for 1100 @xmath1-sized grains in typical , optically thick protoplanetary disk conditions : such dust is well mixed with the gas .",
    "however , as the gas density drops , smaller grains ( more easily probed by scattered light observations ) decouple from the gas .",
    "if the 4 - 20 @xmath1 dust particles , accessible by our observations , are indeed ( marginally ) decoupled from the gas ( st @xmath38 0.1 - 1 ) , the gas surface density should be of the order @xmath38 0.004 g cm@xmath39 , assuming porous grains ( 1.25 g cm@xmath22 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the gas number density found by @xcite ( 10@xmath44 cm@xmath39 ) . under the influence of radiation pressure , dust grains of these sizes in optically - thin disks can be pushed outwards and form ring / torus - like structures @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the newly - discovered inner disk as probed by larger grains could be more striking . since longer wavelength observations better",
    "probe large grains , the disk s presence could be recovered and its structure clarified by high spatial resolution mm interferometry .",
    "its measured submillimeter dust continuum emission ( @xmath38 8.2 @xmath45 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is easily within detectability with alma ; mid - ir interferometry with vlti / matisse may also resolve its emission at high resolution .",

    "<S> the disk is resolved down to @xmath2 025 and appears as an arc - like rim with attached hook - like features . </S>",
    "<S> it is located at an angular separation intermediate between that of warm co gas identified from spatially - resolved mid - infrared spectroscopy and diffuse dust emission recently discovered with the _ hubble space telescope_. the inner disk has a radius of @xmath2 39 au , a position angle consistent with north - up , an inclination of @xmath3 @xmath2 56@xmath4 , and has a center offset from the star . </S>",
    "<S> forward - modeling of the disk favors a thick torus - like emission sharply truncated at separations beyond the torus photocenter and heavily depleted at smaller separations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the best - fit density power law for the dust suggests that the inner disk dust and gas ( as probed by co ) are radially segregated , a feature consistent with the dust trapping mechanism inferred from observations of  canonical \" transitional disks . </S>",
    "<S> however , the inner disk component may instead be explained by radiation pressure - induced migration in optically - thin conditions , in contrast to the two stellar companion / planet - influenced ring - like structures at wider separations . </S>",
    "<S> hd 141569a s circumstellar environment  with three nested , gapped , concentric dust populations  is an excellent laboratory for understanding the relationship between planet formation and the evolution of both dust grains and disk architecture . </S>"
