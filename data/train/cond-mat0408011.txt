    "there is a large body of experimental [ 1 - 14 ] and theoretical ( for a review see [ 15 ] ) evidence that mgb@xmath1 is a multiband superconductor which is well described by an effective two - band model [ 16 ] . in the case of a multiband superconductor one",
    "expects that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 is reduced by the interband nonmagnetic ( i.e.  normal ) impurity scattering in analogy to the effect of such scattering on anisotropic single band superconductors [ 17,18 ] . several years before the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath1 the problem of impurity scattering in a multiband superconductor was examined in detail by golubov and mazin [ 19 ] using the weak coupling bcs - type treatment of the pairing interaction .",
    "they obtained an equation for the change in @xmath0 with the interband impurity scattering rate which is analogous to the abrikosov - gorkov formula for the @xmath0-suppression by paramagnetic impurity scattering in ordinary superconductors .",
    "the bcs - type treatment of ref .",
    "[ 19 ] predicts that the @xmath0 is reduced by about 40 % for the interband scattering rate comparable to @xmath2 . for mgb@xmath1 that would imply a drop in @xmath0 from 39 k to about 25 k for the interband impurity scattering rate @xmath3 of about 1.7 mev .",
    "thus , it was thought that observation of @xmath0 suppression with increasing disorder would provide the final evidence for the two - band model of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "experimentally , however , the situation appears to be more complicated . on one hand , as pointed out in [ 20 ] , the transition temperatures of different samples of mgb@xmath1 are rather insensitive to their respective residual resistivities : the @xmath0s of samples with residual resistivities in the range from 0.4 to 30 @xmath4 cm differ by at most 5% .",
    "on the other hand , irradiation of a polycrystalline sample of mgb@xmath1 by fast neutrons led to an increase of residual resistivity and reduction in @xmath0 by as much as 20% [ 13 ] .",
    "the apparent lack of correlation between @xmath0 and residual resistivity in unirradiated samples was explained [ 20 ] by very small values of the interband impurity scattering matrix elements because of the particular electronic structure of mgb@xmath1 so that the dc transport in this compound at low temperatures is primarily determined by _ intraband _ scattering which does not affect @xmath0 [ 19 ] , while very weak interband scattering leads to no significant change in @xmath0 .",
    "the arguments in [ 20 ] apply to common substitutional impurities in mgb@xmath1 which do not distort the lattice and subsequently erwin and mazin [ 21 ] proposed that substituting mg with al and/or na would produce lattice distortions that could lead to large enough interband impurity scattering rates to cause a reduction of @xmath0 by a couple of degrees as predicted theoretically in [ 19 ] .",
    "presumably the irradiation by fast neutrons generates enough lattice distortions to cause a 20% drop in @xmath0 [ 13 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the break junction tunneling experiments on mgb@xmath1 [ 4 ] clearly indicate that the interband impurity scattering is significant even in undoped and unirradiated samples .",
    "namely , the only justification for using the equations of mcmillan tunneling model for proximity effect [ 22 ] in analyzing the break junction data on mgb@xmath1 is provided by the work of schopohl and scharnberg [ 23 ] on tunneling density of states of a disordered two - band superconductor .",
    "the fact that in the latter case the equations have the form identical to those of the mcmillan tunneling model for proximity effect is a pure accident as is evident from the entirely different meaning of the quasiparticle scattering rates in the two cases .",
    "the interband scattering rates used to fit the tunneling data [ 4 ] were at least as large as those predicted for al / na doped mgb@xmath1 ( @xmath5s were in the range from 1 to 4 mev ) , but the @xmath0 of the material was reported to be 39 k - close to the maximum value for mgb@xmath1 of 39.4 k. a possible solution to this contradiction is that the weak coupling bcs - type treatment of impurity scattering in a multiband superconductor used in [ 19 ] is not _",
    "quantitatively _ accurate for mgb@xmath1 .",
    "the calculated electron - phonon interactions in mgb@xmath1 [ 16 ] indicate that it is a medium - to - strong coupling superconductor ( the largest calculated electron - phonon parameter @xmath6 for @xmath7-band electrons is comparable to the one in nb ) and renormalization and damping effects could play an important role in determining the rate of @xmath0 suppression by interband impurity scattering .",
    "in section 2 we solve the eliashberg equations for a two - band superconductor with nonmagnetic impurity scattering and calculate the transition temperature as a function of the impurity scattering rate using realistic interaction parameters for mgb@xmath1 [ 16,24 ] .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 is suppressed by interband scattering at much slower rate than what was obtained using the bcs treatment in ref .  [ 19 ] .",
    "in the same section we present the functional derivatives @xmath8 , @xmath9 [ 25 ] for several representative impurity interband scattering rates which show how the sensitivity of @xmath0 to various electron - phonon couplings changes with impurity scattering . in section 3",
    "we generalize the bcs approach to include the renormalization caused by the electron - phonon interaction by extending the well known @xmath10-@xmath10 model [ 26 ] to the two - band case .",
    "the numerical solution of such a model is found to be in excellent agreement with the full strong coupling calculation . in section 4",
    "we give a summary .",

    "the reduction in cutoff from @xmath22 to @xmath54 is accompanied by replacement of the coulomb repulsion parameters @xmath60 in ( 9 ) with @xmath61 where the matrix ( in band indices ) @xmath62 is related to matrix @xmath63 by [ 25 ] @xmath64      we solved eqs .",

    "moreover , the strong coupling calculation indicates that it is unrealistic to expect the transition temperature of mgb@xmath1 to ever drop below 60% of its maximum value as a result of impurity scattering and the 20% drop in @xmath0 upon irradiation by fast neutrons [ 13 ] is certainly within our calculated range ( 20% drop in @xmath0 is obtained with @xmath78 of about 4@xmath164 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "hence , the initial expectations based on the bcs treatment of the two - band model [ 19 ] that a dramatic suppression of @xmath0 in mgb@xmath1 with interband impurity scattering would provide the final `` smoking gun '' evidence for the two - band model was exaggerated .    our calculation with @xmath10-@xmath10 model ( long dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) clearly indicates that the main reason for the failure of the bcs approach to quantitatively account for the dependence of @xmath161 on @xmath110 in mgb@xmath1 is that the bcs treatment leaves out the electron - phonon renormalization effects .",
