    "the task of developing fast and reliable computer  assisted methods for search and rescue ( sar ) operations becomes increasingly important due to increased sea traffic and higher risk of emergencies at sea @xcite",
    ".    in previous decades the existing sar systems relied mostly on climatological means as well as were lacking high resolution environmental data @xcite .",
    "advances in a high resolution operational forecast in the mediterranean sea @xcite provided a framework for a more accurate prediction of drifters forecast in this area .",
    "also the inclusion of assimilation schemes in ocean forecast models @xcite helped to improve a prediction of time  dependent currents and wind with respect to earlier models .",
    "a large databank of windage characteristics of sea objects was collected over the years @xcite that uncovered a linear relationship between drift velocity and applied surface wind for different categories of sea drifters .",
    "the field observations were used in the context of trajectory prediction using the approach of stochastic leeway drift @xcite .",
    "the leeway model @xcite produced final positions of drifters based on their windage characteristics @xcite .",
    "additionally the modeling approach enabled prediction of a search area in terms of a probability density .",
    "however , the model does not classify the drifters according to their temporal and spatial behavior . while backtracking simulations could provide a full classification of spatially separated trajectories",
    "time limitation could be an issue in the sar operations and a faster and simpler computational alternative should be provided .",
    "here we proposed a computational approach for characterization of drifters based on a density clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "it was designed to improve qualitative information about the stochastic outcome of the leeway simulations and to increase the prediction probability .",
    "the spatial clustering localizes the areas of higher probability of drifters and finds possible outliers .",
    "also the procedure sorts out ensemble of drifters according to their temporal behavior .",
    "we used the modeling framework based on the explicit parameterization of an object drift by wind @xcite .",
    "two applications of the stochastic leeway model @xcite for tracking of small size surface drifters were studied : ( @xmath1 ) long  term simulation of sea drifters in the western adriatic sea ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath2 ) numerical reconstruction of the elba accident ( @xmath0 ) . in the first study experiments",
    "were performed with drifters released in the vicinity of the known hyperbolic structure of the flow near to the gargano peninsula in the western adriatic sea .",
    "the spatial sorting of drifters was studied by the determination of distinct clusters .",
    "different categories of drifters and geophysical forcing were tested as well . in the second study qualitative comparison between the behavior of reconstructed trajectories of drifters and known",
    "information about the elba accident was performed using ensembles of stochastic simulations . in both applications",
    "the clustering method provided improved probability estimate of final search areas via the sorting of drifters according to their spatial distribution .",
    "the leeway drift is defined as a drift of floating object with respect to ambient current under the influence of wind and waves @xcite . according to the definition",
    "the leeway velocity is determined from a difference between drift velocity @xmath3 and eulerian current velocity @xmath4 of a sea object : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the leeway velocity .",
    "the integration trajectory is obtained by calculating the drifters path according to formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the time step , @xmath9 represents a diffusive component of velocity due to sub  scale variability of ocean currents that is below the given model resolution , @xmath4 is the eulerian current taken from the ocean model . the leeway drift @xmath6 is parametrized by @xmath10  m atmospheric wind @xmath11 ( see appendix eq",
    ".  [ leewaycoeff ] ) .",
    "since in field campaigns the contribution of the stokes drift to the motion of a drifter was difficult to separate from the effect of wind @xcite . in the present modeling paradigm a sea dominated by weak waves is considered and the waves are assumed to be alighed with the wind .",
    "the influence of stokes drift is implicitly included through leeway coefficients ( see appendix eq .  [ leewaycoeff ] ) . the model accounts for the action of wind on small drifters and neglect damping and excitation by waves @xcite .    since in general shape and size of a sea object is not regular it moves at a certain angle to the wind direction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the leeway velocity is decomposed into the downwind ( dwl ) and crosswind ( cwl ) leeway components which are projections of leeway drift on wind direction @xmath12 @xcite . also due to uncertainty of initial orientation of a drifter with respect to wind an initial ensemble",
    "is generated with a half of drifters oriented left and remaining half right with respect to wind direction @xcite . because of the existing variability of wind , currents and some perturbation of the drifter motion its orientation can abruptly change .",
    "the change of orientation is introduced via the alternation of the sign of the cwl component . in this study probability of change of sign equal to @xmath13 per integration step @xcite .    since a finite size of geographical domain",
    "was considered the drifters could reach the boundary of the domain or approach the coastal shoreline . in the former case",
    "they were marked as off  grid and removed from further consideration .",
    "stranded drifters were identified according to a high  resolution coastline contour @xcite .    often during emergency situations at sea exact information about an accident is missing .",
    "the leeway model accounts for the uncertainties in the position of an accident @xcite by assigning initial positions from a normal distribution centered around an expected location of an accident .",
    "particularly , the drifters are released continuously in a spatial area defined by initial distance @xmath14 around the last known position ( lkp ) , where @xmath15 is the variance of drifters initial positions .",
    "the lkp refers to the possible location of an accident and is provided in terms of longitude and latitude for every drifter . in the experiments studied here drifters were released simultaneously . in general uncertainty in time",
    "could be included @xcite .    to include the sub ",
    "grid variabilities of the wind and current velocities the gaussian perturbations were added at every integration step @xmath16 and for the @xmath17th drifter : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the uncertainties chosen from a normal distributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspondingly . the standard deviation ( std ) of wind @xmath23 current @xmath24",
    "were estimated using averages over the corresponding geographical domain .",
    "the eulerian velocity of drifter @xmath4 was obtained using bilinear interpolation of the model zonal and meridional components at the position of a drifter .",
    "also weighted linear time interpolation was used to interpolate current and wind velocities between two subsequent time stamps . in our simulations",
    "the integration step @xmath25 was taken .",
    "for the advection scheme the runge kutta second  order method was used with the euler first ",
    "order trial step @xcite .      in the implementation of the algorithm",
    "the final positions of drifters were used for evaluation of a spatial separation between pairs of drifters .",
    "the separation distance was estimated from the haversine formula : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the earth radius , @xmath28 are drifter indices , @xmath29 are longitudes and latitudes of the @xmath30th drifter and @xmath31 .",
    "the mean separation distance @xmath32 was evaluated from eq .",
    "[ haversine ] across all distinct pairs of drifters .",
    "also an upper bound @xmath33 was assigned to exclude mean separation distance that exceeds the size of a given geographical domain . indeed , in the case @xmath34 no clusters were searched .    for the @xmath30th drifter a new cluster was formed by the inclusion of the @xmath17th neighbor provided that the condition @xmath35 was satisfied .",
    "the procedure was finalized after sorting all possible pairs of drifters .",
    "application of the algorithm produced a set of spatially separated clusters .",
    "we classified a probability of containment ( @xmath36 ) of drifters per cluster as follows : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a number of drifters inside the @xmath17th cluster and @xmath39 is an ensemble size .",
    "the mean cluster trajectory ( center of mass of the cluster ) is defined as the time sequence of mean longitudes and latitudes across all cluster members calculated at every time step .",
    "six hourly @xmath10 m wind fields with @xmath40 spatial resolution were retrieved from the ecmwf .    for typical sar objects of small size @xcite only top surface levels of ocean currents were used . in our study",
    ", we used oceanographic data from two operational models : the mfs with a horizontal resolution of about @xmath41 @xcite and the afs ( horizontal resolution from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) @xcite . in the vicinity of shorelines a sea  over  land interpolation procedure was implemented to provide a horizontal interpolation of the ocean currents towards coastal zone .",
    "the stochastic simulations of an ensemble of @xmath44 drifters were performed using various simulation scenarios ( see the summary of experiments in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "all drifters were released simultaneously from the position @xmath45 n , @xmath46 e.    the mean surface wind evaluated for a study period ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) strongly contributed to the north  eastern displacement of surface drifters in the area around the release position . also the western adriatic boundary current ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) was influencing the transport of near coast drifters southwards during the given period .    in the first experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) a significant part of an ensemble of drifters was carried by the western coastal flow initially southwards and later towards the inner southern adriatic circulation .",
    "the majority of drifters were localized in the southern adriatic ( clusters @xmath2 and @xmath47 ) , a small part of the ensemble ( cluster @xmath1 ) was stranded on the western coast and the remaining drifters due to low velocities were localized inside the release zone ( cluster @xmath48 ) .    the second experiment ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) was done for person in water ( piw ) category ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) with the atmospheric wind . during @xmath49 days of simulations",
    "the wind and currents influenced the dispersion of drifters across the whole adriatic basin towards the eastern adriatic coast : small size clusters ( clusters @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and isolated drifters were localized in the central adriatic . as in the experiment without the wind ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) a fraction of stranded drifters was found inside the release area ( cluster @xmath1 ) .",
    "no large size clusters were formed in this case .",
