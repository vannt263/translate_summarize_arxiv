    "it is easy to see that every word of length @xmath5 constructed from the symbols @xmath6 and @xmath7 contains a square , so it is impossible to avoid squares in infinite binary words .",
    "however , in 1974 , entringer , jackson , and schatz proved the surprising fact that there exists an infinite binary word containing no squares @xmath0 with @xmath8 .",

    "he also proved that every overlap - free word contains arbitrarily large squares .",
    "these two results suggest the following natural question : for each length @xmath13 , determine the fractional exponent @xmath14 ( if it exists ) such that    * there is no infinite binary word simultaneously avoiding squares @xmath0 with @xmath15 and fractional powers @xmath16 with @xmath17 ; * there is an infinite binary word simultaneously avoiding squares @xmath0 with @xmath15 and fractional powers @xmath16 with @xmath18 ?    here we say a word @xmath19 is an @xmath20th power ( @xmath20 rational ) if there exist words @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a prefix of @xmath24 with @xmath25 . for example",
