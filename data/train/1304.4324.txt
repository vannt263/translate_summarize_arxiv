    "popularity prediction on social networks can help users sift through the vast stream of online contents and enable advertisers to maximize revenue through differential pricing for access to content or advertisement placement .",
    "popularity prediction is challenging since numerous factors can affect the popularity of online content .",
    "moreover , popularity is very asymmetric and broadly - distributed . several pioneering work devoted to the characteristics and mechanisms of information diffusion  @xcite .",
    "several efforts have been made to study the popularity prediction on social networks .",
    "szabo et al .",
    "@xcite found that the final popularity is reflected by the popularity in early period by investigating digg and youtube .",
    "a direct extrapolation method is then employed to predict the long - term popularity .",
    "lerman et al .",
    "@xcite modeled users vote process on digg by considering both the interestingness and the visibility of online content .",
    "hong et al.@xcite formulated the popularity prediction as a classification problem .",
    "however , existing methods pay little attention to the structural characteristic of the propagation path of online content . in this paper",
    ", we consider the popularity prediction problem by studying the relationship between the popularity of online content and the structural characteristics of the underlying propagation network .",
    "the study is conducted on the sina weibo , the biggest microblogging network in china .",
    "experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state - of - the - art method which neglects the structural characteristics of social networks .",
    "this indicates that the structural diversity would give us some insights to understand the mechanism of information diffusion and to predict the long - term popularity of a tweet .",
    "in this paper , the popularity prediction aims to predict the popularity @xmath0 of a tweet at a _ reference time _",
    "@xmath1 , given the forward information of this tweet before an _ indicating time _ @xmath2 .",
    "the indicating time @xmath2 is the time at which we observe the information of a tweet and the reference time @xmath1 is the time at which we predict the popularity of the tweet .",
    "the popularity @xmath3 is measured by the number of times that a tweet is re - tweeted at time @xmath4 .",
    "we first study the structural characteristics of the forward path of tweets . encouraged by the work in  @xcite , we investigate whether the final popularity of a tweet is well indicated by the structural characteristics of the network consisting of users that re - tweet the tweet at an earlier time .",
    "specifically , we analyze the structural characteristics of a tweet with the following two measurements on its re - tweet path at @xmath5 hour after it is posted .",
    "the first measurement is _",
    "link density_. among all users that have forwarded the tweet @xmath6 at time @xmath2 , link density is the ratio of the number of followship links to the number of all possible links .",
    "the other measurement is the _ diffusion depth _ , which is the longest length of the path from the submitter to any user that has retweeted the tweet @xmath6 at time @xmath2 .",
    "we report the final popularity of a tweet with respect to the link density and the diffusion depth .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : structural ] , there exists a strong negative linear correlation between the final popularity and the link density , and there exists a strong positive near - linear correlation between the final popularity and the diffusion depth .",
    "this finding tells us that a diverse group of earlier users , reflected with low link density and large diffusion depth , leads to a wide spreading of a tweet .",
    "therefore , the structural characteristics of diffusion paths of a tweet at an earlier time can help predict its final popularity .         based on the above findings , we propose two improved approaches to predict the final popularity using earlier popularity and structural characteristics .",
    "we estimate the logarithmic final popularity with a combination of the logarithmic early popularity and the logarithmic link density , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the link density at or before time @xmath2 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are global coefficients that will be learned from the data .",
    "similarly , we define a diffusion depth version to estimate the logarithmic final popularity of a tweet as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the diffusion depth of the tweet @xmath6 at or before time @xmath2 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are also global coefficients .    to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches , we compare them with a baseline approach which estimates the final popularity with the early popularity alone  @xcite .",
    "the baseline predicts the final popularity using @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are also global coefficients that will be learned from the data .",
    "we use sina weibo dataset published by wise 2012 challenge .",
    "we select the tweets posted during july 1 - 31 , 2011 and all the re - tweet paths occurred during july 1-august 31 , 2011 .",
    "the data set consists of 16.6 million tweets .",
    "this data set also contains a snapshot of the social network of sina weibo .",
    "the social network contains 58.6 millions of registered users and 265.5 millions of following relations .",
    ".prediction error of three approaches . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we take @xmath20 of all the tweets in the dataset as the training set and the rest @xmath21 as the testing set .",
    "the predictions are evaluated with _ rmse _",
    "( root mean squared error ) and _ mae _ ( mean absolute error ) . as reported in table [ table:1 ] ,",
    "the approach incorporating the link density significantly reduces the prediction error compared with the baseline , and the approach incorporating the diffusion depth performs even better . here , the values of @xmath10 and @xmath15 in previous formulas that we learned from the data is 0.04 and 0.07 separately .",
    "the results empirically demonstrate that early structural characteristics affect the final popularity .",
    "low link density and long diffusion path implies that a tweet is more probably spread to different parts of the network , which helps the tweet become known by a greater population .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how to predict the popularity of short message in sina weibo .",
    "we find that structural characteristics provide strong evidence for the final popularity . a low link density and a deep diffusion usually lead to wide spreading , capturing the intuition that a diverse group of individuals spread a message to wider audience than a dense group . based on such a finding , we propose two approaches by incorporating the early popularity with the link density and the diffusion depth of early adopters .",
    "experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly reduce the error of popularity prediction .",
    "our finding provides a new perspective to understand the popularity prediction problem and is helpful to build accurate prediction models in the future .",
