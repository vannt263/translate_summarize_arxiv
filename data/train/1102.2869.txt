    "the densities in the interior of neutron stars exceed the ground state density of atomic nuclei , @xmath3@xmath4 , by far .",
    "this naturally raises the idea , that compact stars might contain a deconfined and chirally restored quark phase .",
    "recently , @xcite found a new robust mass limit for compact stars by determining the mass of the millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 to be @xmath5m@xmath1 .",
    "this value , together with the mass of pulsar j1903 + 0327 of @xmath6m@xmath1 @xcite is much larger than the hulse - taylor limit of @xmath7m@xmath1 @xcite , which for a long time has been the highest precisely measured pulsar mass . in this letter",
    "we want to explore the implications of this new measurement on the possible presence of quark matter in compact stars .",
    "moreover , our aim is to map out the parameter range for the widely used quark bag model with respect to its ability to reproduce high mass compact stars such as psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "+ there are two classes of compact stars which contain quark matter .",
    "the first class are so - called hybrid stars , with quarks only in their interior either in form of a pure quark matter core or a quark - hadron mixed phase .",
    "the size of the core depends hereby on the critical density for the quark - hadron phase transition @xmath8 under neutron star conditions .",
    "the second class of so - called ( strange ) quark stars is realized for the special scenario of absolutely stable strange quark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the idea that the presence of strange quarks can lower the energy per baryon of the mixture of up , down , and strange quarks in weak equilibrium below the one of @xmath9fe ( @xmath10mev ) . as a consequence ,",
    "this strange quark matter forms the true ground state of nuclear matter and occupies the entire compact star @xcite .",
    "+ the mass measurement for psr j1614 - 2230 sets for the first time very strong limits for the parameters of any zero temperature equation of state ( eos ) , and thereby also for the one of quark matter .",
    "usually , the appearance of strangeness in quark and hadronic matter provides an additional degree of freedom and thereby softens the nuclear eos , that is , decreases the pressure for a given energy density . as a result , quark and",
    "hybrid stars can not reach high masses .",
    "however , many studies found that effects from the strong interaction , such as one - gluon exchange or color - superconductivity can stiffen the quark matter eos and increase the maximum mass of quark and hybrid stars @xcite . @xcite and @xcite gave first studies on the implications of the new mass limits from psr j1614 - 2230 for quark and hybrid stars in the quark bag model .",
    "however , as we will show below , a systematic analysis of the whole allowed parameter range is still missing .",
    "+ @xcite include strange quark matter in form of a bag model eos for quark stars as well as hybrid stars .",
    "the authors do not study strong effects from color - superconductivity and impose the additional constraint of @xmath11 .",
    "this is a reasonable @xcite , but not necessary condition @xcite .",
    "moreover , they exclude a priori the existence of a quark - hadron mixed phase and come to the conclusion , that the existence of a @xmath12m@xmath13 star would exclude the quark - hadron phase transition in compact star interiors .",
    "as we will show in the next sections our results can not confirm this statement , furthermore we find that a quark - hadron mixed phase in fact plays a major role in supporting high mass hybrid stars . + in a different analysis by @xcite , the authors studied the implications of the new measurement on hybrid stars with a parameterized quark bag model including effects from color - superconductivity and qcd corrections .",
    "they find that both effects are required to support the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "however , @xcite adjust the bag constant to obtain a fixed density of @xmath14 for the phase transition to quark matter from the relatively soft apr nucleonic eos @xcite .",
    "we find that the stiffness of the hadronic eos is important for large hybrid star masses and also that the maximum mass of hybrid star configurations experiences a minimum at around @xmath15@xmath4 - values close to the critical density which @xcite choose for their calculations .",
    "+ therefore , the aim of this paper is to fully and systematically exploit the constraints on the quark bag eos provided by the new mass limit of @xcite .",
    "quark matter is described by a bag model eos with first order corrections from the strong interaction coupling constant and effects from finite strange quark mass and color - superconductivity .",
    "for the hybrid star calculations , we use the two different relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) parameter sets tm1 @xcite and nl3 @xcite , to explore the influence of the hadronic part of the eos . in our calculations",
    "we do not include hyperons which can alter the quark hadron phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , their exact role is currently an open question ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in this work , we will focus on non - strange hadronic matter .",
    "we consider the two possible extreme cases for the phase coexistence between quark and hadronic matter : the maxwell transition , corresponding to a very large surface tension of quark matter @xcite , and the gibbs construction @xcite which completely neglects coulomb and surface energies .",
    "+ in the following we will describe our results and compare them with the aforementioned studies .",
    "sections [ uqm ] and [ cscqm ] are devoted to quark stars with unpaired and color - superconducting quark matter in the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase , respectively .",
    "hybrid stars are discussed in section [ hybrid ] .",
    "for the strange quark matter , we take the modified bag model : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the grand potentials for the up , down , and strange quarks and electrons describing these as non - interacting fermions .",
    "we choose the strange quark mass to be @xmath18mev @xcite while the masses of the up and down quarks and electrons are set to zero . in the sense of the generic quark matter",
    "eos from @xcite , we have added the @xmath19 term with the baryon chemical potential @xmath20 of the quarks in order to account for corrections from strong interaction .",
    "the usual approach in quark bag models is to unite all non - perturbative effects of the strong interactions into a bag constant @xmath21 .",
    "the eos can then be extended by including first order corrections in the strong coupling constant ( see e.g. fraga et al .",
    "2001 ) . the quark bag model in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is motivated by this approach . however , since quark star matter is not in the perturbative regime , we consider @xmath19 and the bag constant as effective parameters , denoting the latter by @xmath22 , and explore their whole parameter range .",
    "therefore , we vary @xmath19 from @xmath23 , which corresponds to no qcd corrections , to small values when the corrections are strong . equation ( [ eq1 ] ) enables us to compute the pressure , energy density , and baryon number density assuming charge neutrality and @xmath24equilibrium . by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations we obtain the maximum quark star masses .",
    "+ following @xcite , we require nonstrange quark matter in bulk to have a binding energy per baryon higher than the one of the most stable atomic nucleus , @xmath9fe , which is @xmath25mev , plus a @xmath26mev correction coming from surface effects . by imposing that @xmath27mev for @xmath28flavor quark matter at ground state , we ensure that atomic nuclei do not dissolve into their constituent quarks .",
    "thereby we obtain an upper limit on the maximum mass of strange quark stars denoted as `` 2-flavor line '' in fig .",
    "[ unpaired ] .     and @xmath19 .",
    "the green shaded area marks the allowed parameter region according to the constraints of the existence of nuclei ( 2-flavor line ) , absolute stability of strange quark matter ( 3-flavor line ) , stability of fast rotating stars ( kepler line ) , and the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 including its @xmath29 error.,width=302 ]    another constraint is given by the implementation of the strange matter hypothesis @xcite as described in the introduction , with @xmath30mev for strange quark matter at ground state @xcite .",
    "this condition results in the `` 3-flavor line '' in fig .",
    "[ unpaired ] and gives a lower limit on the maximum masses .",
    "[ unpaired ] also shows lines of constant maximum mass .",
    "the three dotted lines enclosing the red shaded area represent the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 with its @xmath29 error @xcite .",
    "the 2-flavor and the 3-flavor lines cross on the left outside the plot range at @xmath31 , @xmath32mev which correspond to a maximum mass star with m@xmath33m@xmath1 and a radius of @xmath34 km .",
    "the kepler line at low @xmath22 represents a limit for quark stars which can rotate with a keplerian frequency of at least 716 hz @xcite .",
    "therefore , the green shaded area is the allowed quark star parameter region with a maximum mass of @xmath35m@xmath1 at @xmath36 and @xmath37mev .",
    "however , the kepler line is obtained from a parametrization of @xcite and gives a rough estimate when applied to strange stars . for a more reliable kepler limit",
    ", the presented quark eoss should be applied in general relativistic calculations of rotating quark stars similar to the studies of @xcite or @xcite . from fig.[unpaired ] , we see that for @xmath38 the 2-flavor line requires m@xmath39m@xmath1 which is ruled out by the new mass limit , at least within its @xmath29 error .",
    "thus we find that @xmath40 , i.e. qcd corrections must be included to ensure the compatibility of the model with observational data .      at large densities , such as in compact star interiors , up , down , and",
    "strange quarks are assumed to undergo pairing and form the so - called cfl phase .",
    "we adopt the eos from @xcite which introduces the pairing energy @xmath41 as a new free parameter : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "we added again the @xmath44term to account for qcd corrections .",
    "the results for @xmath45 and @xmath18mev are shown in fig .",
    "[ cfl ] where we have imposed the same constraints as in fig .",
    "[ unpaired ] .",
    "the `` 3-flavor '' and `` 2-flavor '' lines give again a lower and upper limit on the maximum mass .",
    "the green shaded area is the maximally allowed parameter region .",
    "its upper edge is solely given by the constraint from the mass measurement of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "note , that for small values of @xmath41 quark stars are not allowed . for large gaps starting at @xmath46mev the allowed area opens up and one can obtain high maximum masses .",
    "the largest mass allowed within the plot range is @xmath47m@xmath1 at @xmath45 , @xmath48mev and @xmath49mev .",
    "if we assume the same constraint from the keplerian frequency as before , we find , that it has no influence on our results within the plot range of fig .",
    "more exotic parameter combinations , as e.g. @xmath50 , @xmath51mev , @xmath52mev and @xmath53 , @xmath54mev , @xmath49mev with maximum masses of @xmath12m@xmath1 and @xmath55m@xmath1 respectively are also allowed .",
    "+ taking into account qcd corrections , i.e lowering @xmath19 , gives maximum mass lines shifted to only slightly lower values of @xmath22 .",
    "together with the lowered 2-flavor and 3-flavor lines this means that at some point the 3-flavor constraint will become important .",
    "still we can obtain quite large maximum masses at a sufficiently high gap value . varying the strange quark mass basically results in shifting the maximum mass lines along the gap - axis as the crucial contribution to",
    "the eos comes from a term @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath19 and a higher strange mass , the allowed area opens up at a larger value of @xmath41 .    , but this time for color - superconducting strange quark matter with the pairing gap @xmath41 and fixed @xmath45.,width=302 ]",
    "for the hybrid star calculations we use again the bag model eos of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and the same quark masses as in the previous sections . as hadronic eoss",
    "we choose the tm1 and nl3 rmf parameter sets , with maximum neutron star masses of @xmath57m@xmath1 and @xmath58m@xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the critical density @xmath8 for the quark - hadron phase transition is mainly given by the effective bag constant @xmath22 while corrections from the strong interaction @xmath19 affect the stiffness of the quark eos .",
    "combinations of small values for @xmath19 and @xmath22 lead therefore to stiff hybrid eoss with a low critical density @xcite . as a consequence , the corresponding hybrid stars can be very massive and have a large quark matter core .",
    "similar to @xcite we omit all parameter combinations which lead to several transitions between quark and hadronic matter , which happens for small @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "+ the phase transitions are modelled by the gibbs and maxwell constructions ( see e.g. @xcite ) corresponding to a small ( gibbs ) and to a large value of the surface tension ( maxwell ) ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the former leads to the presence of an extended quark - hadron mixed phase region in the compact star interior where the pressure rises smoothly with density . with the maxwell approach , matter experiences a direct transition from hadronic to quark matter in cold compact stars , accompanied by a density jump from lower ( hadronic phase ) to higher ( quark phase ) densities . applying both models for the phase transition we calculate the hybrid star maximum masses and",
    "plot them as a function of the bag constant @xmath22 for fixed values of @xmath19 .",
    "[ mass_tm1 ] shows the hybrid star maximum mass curves for the tm1 eos for the hadronic phase , while in fig .",
    "[ mass_nl3 ] we show the results for the nl3 model .",
    "the lines which extend from low values to high values of @xmath22 correspond to calculations using the gibbs phase transition .",
    "stars on the solid lines have a pure quark matter core while the dashed lines represent stars where only a mixed phase is present .",
    "the maximum masses for the maxwell transition are represented by the grey shaded area . due to the absence of a mixed phase , hybrid stars in the maxwell approach",
    "can only contain a pure quark matter core . a too large density jump from hadronic to quark matter in their interior leads to a gravitational instability against radial oscillations . as a consequence we find from figs .",
    "[ mass_tm1 ] and [ mass_nl3 ] that the parameter range for hybrid stars in the maxwell approach is significantly reduced in comparison to the `` gibbs hybrid stars '' .",
    "furthermore , in most of the cases we find that for the same combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath19 the maxwell phase transition leads to lower hybrid star maximum masses than the ones with a gibbs construction .",
    "only for low values of @xmath19 when quark matter becomes very stiff , the maximum masses of the `` maxwell hybrid stars '' can become significantly larger than their gibbs counterparts .     and @xmath19 .",

    "however , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ mass_tm1 ] and [ mass_nl3 ] , a pure quark matter core in hybrid stars occurs only for small values of @xmath22 . for the tm1 hadronic eos ,",
    "sufficiently massive gibbs hybrid stars contain only a mixed phase in the core . on the other hand ,",
    "for the nl3 hadronic eos with low values of @xmath22 and @xmath8 , large cores of pure quark matter exist down to @xmath59 .",
    "this is a consequence of the much stiffer nl3 hadronic eos in comparison to the tm1 parameter set .",
    "nevertheless , hybrid stars with a pure quark core and a mass @xmath60m@xmath1 are only obtained for @xmath61 . +",
    "a common feature which is seen for hybrid stars in the gibbs approach is that for a fixed value of @xmath19 the maximum masses decrease with lower critical densities and experience a minimum around @xmath62@xmath4 . for smaller @xmath8 ,",
    "the quark eos starts to dominate and the maximum masses increase again as they approach the limit of absolutely stable strange quark matter .",
    "we plot the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 with its @xmath29 error as a gray band as well as lines at m@xmath63m@xmath64 and m@xmath65m@xmath64 to indicate the masses of the hulse - taylor pulsar and of j1903 + 0327 respectively @xcite . especially in fig .",
    "[ mass_tm1 ] it can be seen that the new mass limit significantly tightens the constraints on the model parameters , as the whole area below the gray band is now excluded while formerly this was only the case below the @xmath66m@xmath1 line . in this work",
    "we did not consider effects of a finite surface tension on the quark - hadron mixed phase @xcite which has been found to be an intermediate of the gibbs and the maxwell constructions @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath67 parameter space for stable hybrid stars with finite surface tension can be expected to be between the gibbs and the maxwell constructions .",
    "therefore our result , that hybrid stars can be massive , remains valid .",
    "we present for the first time a comprehensive and systematic study on the constraints of the new compact star mass limit from the millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 on the properties of quark and hybrid stars modelled within an extended quark bag model .",
    "the parameters of the bag model are an effective bag constant , corrections from the strong interaction coupling constant and color - superconductivity .",
    "we find that the new mass limit does not rule out the possibility of having quark matter in compact stars but provides tight bounds on its properties .",
    "high compact star masses where quark matter is the dominant component , require strong qcd corrections and/or a large contribution from color - superconductivity . in this case strange stars",
    "can reach masses far beyond @xmath2m@xmath1 . for hybrid stars with a sizeable quark matter phase",
    ", our investigation shows that pure quark matter cores are obtained only for a small parameter range when the hadronic eos is stiff and the critical density for the quark - hadron phase transition is around saturation density .",
    "our results agree with @xcite concerning the importance of effective qcd corrections to reach high compact star masses .",
    "contrarily to one of the statements of @xcite , we find that pairing helps to increase the maximum mass and that corrections from the strong interaction have a significant effect . for hybrid stars",
    "we demonstrate that the allowed parameter region hinges crucially on the stiffness of the hadronic eos and can therefore be much larger than in the case of @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the possible existence of a @xmath68m@xmath1 star .",
    "if such a measurement is confirmed , even larger corrections from the strong coupling constant and larger values of the cfl gap will be required for strange stars .",
    "hybrid stars could exist only for a stiff hadronic eos and would contain only a core with a quark - hadron mixed phase in our approach .",
    "+ an investigation similar to the one we presented here would also be desirable for other effective models of qcd such as the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) and the pnjl models @xcite , as well as schwinger - dyson approaches , as recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "although mass measurements are very useful for constraining the nuclear matter eos , additional observational information is required to probe the existence of quark matter in compact stars .",
    "cooling , r - modes calculations , and gravitational wave signals of mergers @xcite are promising tools .",
    "also heavy ions collisions experiments provide crucial information on the nuclear matter eos : an extended analysis on the quark models paramaters which includes both astrophysical constraints , as the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 , and terrestrial laboratories constraints would be extemely interesting .",
