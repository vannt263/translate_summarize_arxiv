    "for many years the ising model and the corresponding glauber dynamics have been a very active research field . in the 1990 s the asymptotics of the spectral gap of the ising model with free boundary condition",
    "were connected to surface tension , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the inversion time of the infinite volume ising model phase under a small field was then related to wulff energies @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "precise estimates were achieved for the spectral gap and mixing time @xcite .",
    "recently impressive moves towards evidence of lifshitz behavior and mean - curvature displacement of interfaces were achieved in @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on the consequences of the presence of disorder on the dynamics , in the phase coexistence region .",
    "since  @xcite ( and references therein ) it has been known that dilution in the ising model triggers slow , non - exponential relaxation to equilibrium in the griffiths phase .",
    "here we focus on the _ phase coexistence _ region , which means that , at equilibrium , the system can be either in the plus or the minus phase .",
    "this setting was considered already in @xcite where heuristic discussions suggested that autocorrelation decays as a negative power of time . in the present paper",
    "we turn these heuristics into rigorous proofs .",
    "previous stages of this project were the adaptation of the coarse graining and of the wulff construction to the disordered setting , see @xcite respectively .",
    "our main result is a lower bound on the autocorrelation ( theorem [ thm - lwb - a ] ) which validates the heuristics of @xcite .",
    "that is to say , when both the initial configuration includes a droplet of the minus phase and the surface tension on the boundary of the droplet is smaller than its quenched value , the system must cross an energy barrier before the droplet can disappear .",
    "interestingly we show that the energy gap can be computed on continuous evolutions of the droplet , a slight improvement in comparison with the usual scheme of computing the bottleneck as the maximum gap in energy over all intermediate magnetization , as in @xcite .",
    "we also present in this work an upper bound on the autocorrelation when @xmath1 ( theorem [ thm - upb - a ] ) together with some consequences of our estimates on the typical spectral gap and mixing times in finite volume ( theorems [ thm - trel ] ) .",
    "we would like to mention that , although is it the case here , we do not expect that dilution always slows down relaxation . indeed ,",
    "for the infinite volume dilute ising system subject to a small positive external field , the dilution has a catalyst effect on the transition from the minus to the ( equilibrium ) plus phase , cf .",
