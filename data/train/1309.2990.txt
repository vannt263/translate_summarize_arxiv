    "describing the transverse momentum distributions of particles produced in hard processes in high  energy @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering ( semi  inclusive deep ",
    "inelastic scattering or dis , drell  yan pair production ) has been a focus of recent theoretical research in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . at sufficiently large transverse",
    "momenta @xmath9 the observed particle distributions are generated by individual qcd processes and can be computed in fixed ",
    "order perturbation theory , starting from the well  known collinear ( i.e. , integrated over transverse momenta ) parton distributions in the initial nucleon(s ) .",
    "the scale dependence of these functions due to qcd radiation is described by the dokshitzer et al .",
    "( dglap ) evolution equations . at lower transverse",
    "momenta the observed @xmath10 distributions are the result of an interplay of several factors : the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons in the nucleon , soft qcd final  state interactions , and the transverse momentum incurred in the parton fragmentation process .",
    "qcd radiation in this kinematics is subject to sudakov suppression and leads to evolution equations of collins  soper  sterman ( css ) type for the transverse momentum distributions.@xcite considerable progress has been made@xcite in formulating a factorized description of semi  inclusive dis at low @xmath10 , establishing the qcd operator definitions of the pertinent transverse momentum dependent ( or tmd ) parton distribution and fragmentation functions , and deriving the css  type qcd evolution equations for the latter.@xcite in order to apply this formalism to actual data one needs to understand the basic properties of the tmd distributions at a low scale , which represent the initial condition for the solution of the evolution equations , as determined by non  perturbative qcd interactions .",
    "this includes the dynamical mechanisms producing intrinsic transverse momentum in the nucleon , the shape of the distributions , and the natural starting scale for perturbative qcd evolution.@xcite",
    "of particular interest is a comparison of the transverse momentum distributions of `` valence '' quarks , @xmath11 , and `` sea '' quarks @xmath12 , at a low scale.@xcite since they are created by different non  perturbative mechanisms one expects these distributions to have different properties .",
    "the essential points can be explained with heuristic arguments , to be supported by dynamical model calculations later .",
    "the nucleon s valence quark structure generally follows the pattern of a bound state with fixed particle number and approximately independent motion of the constituents ( mean  field picture ) .",
    "independent evidence for the approximate mean  field character of the nucleon s valence quark light  cone wave function comes _",
    "e.g. _ from an analysis of the empirical transverse charge densities , which shows that the @xmath13 ratio of densities is practically constant over a wide range of distances @xmath14.@xcite in such mean  field systems the single  particle momentum ",
    "space wave functions are fourier  conjugate to the corresponding coordinate  space functions .",
    "up to trivial effects of relativistic kinematics the transverse momentum distributions are therefore governed by a single dynamical scale , namely the inverse overall size of the bound state , @xmath15 .",
    "such behavior is indeed observed in a variety of relativistic quark models based on the mean  field approximation ( bag model , covariant bound  state models , light ",
    "front models).@xcite    sea quarks in the nucleon s light ",
    "cone wave functions appear due to non - perturbative interactions at distance scales generally unrelated to the overall nucleon size , including much shorter distances .",
    "of particular importance are the short  range forces responsible for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd . in the euclidean ( imaginary  time )",
    "formulation of qcd such forces are induced by topologically charged gauge fields of characteristic size @xmath16 , whose properties have been studied extensively in lattice simulations and analytic approximation schemes.@xcite these interactions are responsible for the appearance of a condensate of quark  antiquark pairs in the vacuum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chisb]a ) , and , more generally , for the dynamical generation of the masses of light hadrons in qcd .",
    "there is strong evidence that a large part of the quark ",
    "antiquark sea in the nucleon s partonic structure is due to such chiral  symmetry  breaking interactions ; _",
    "e.g. _  in the observed non ",
    "trivial flavor structure of the sea .",
    "this would imply that sea quarks can have transverse momenta of the order of the chiral  symmetry  breaking scale @xmath4 , much larger than the inverse nucleon size @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chisb]b )",
    ". one would thus expect the @xmath2 distribution of sea quarks to be qualitatively different from that of valence quarks .    in the terminology of nuclear physics , the nucleon in qcd represents a many  body system with short  range correlations induced by the chiral  symmetry  breaking interactions .",
    "the transverse structure is determined by _ two dynamical scales : _ the overall size of the system , @xmath17 , and the size of the correlations , @xmath18 .",
    "the valence and sea quark transverse momentum distributions are affected by these dynamical scales in different ways .",
    "this basic feature is principally not described by single ",
    "scale mean  field models of the nucleon .",
    "the qualitative difference between the valence and sea quark @xmath2 distributions has numerous implications for semi  inclusive dis measurements and could potentially be tested directly using special observables . in semi",
    " inclusive dis at @xmath19 the transverse momentum of the identified hadron @xmath20 is compounded from the intrinsic @xmath2 of the struck parton , soft qcd final  state interactions , and the transverse momentum incurred in the fragmentation process ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sidis]a ) .",
    "the strength of the different mechanisms is poorly known at present , making it difficult to quantify how differences in the intrinsic @xmath2 distributions express themselves in the observable hadron distributions .",
    "differential measurements of kinematic dependencies ( e.g. @xmath21 distributions for fixed @xmath22 , @xmath23 distributions for fixed @xmath21 ) could help to disentangle the different mechanisms but require wide kinematic coverage and high statistics .",
    "detailed measurements of multiplicities have recently been reported by the hermes and compass experiments.@xcite the valence quark region will be covered with high precision with the jlab 12 gev upgrade , but the kinematics is marginal for applying qcd factorization . a much broader kinematic region would become accessible with a future electron  ion collider ( eic ) , permitting detailed studies of the production mechanism , @xmath24evolution , and sea quark distributions.@xcite    special observables can detect systematic differences between the valence and sea quark @xmath2 distributions without detailed modeling of the semi  inclusive production mechanism.@xcite one possibility is to measure the difference and sum of the charged pion multiplicity distributions for a deuteron target ( isoscalar ) , which in schematic notation are proportional to @xmath25 n_{\\pi + , \\ ; { \\rm deut } } \\ ; + \\ ; n_{\\pi - , \\ ; { \\rm deut}}\\ ;   & \\propto & \\ ; ( e_u^2 + e_d^2 ) \\ ;   f_1^{u + d + \\bar u + \\bar d } \\ ; \\otimes \\ ; d_1^{+ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 denote the difference / sum of the quark and antiquark distributions in the proton and @xmath27 the difference / sum of the favored and unfavored pion fragmentation functions ; isospin symmetry is used and the contribution of the strange sea has been neglected . a broader intrinsic @xmath2 distribution of sea quarks than of valence quarks should generally manifest itself in a decrease of the ratio @xmath28 with increasing pion transverse momentum @xmath29 , or could simply be observed by comparing the normalized @xmath29 dependence of the difference and sum .",
    "such measurements should be performed at moderately small values @xmath30 , where valence and sea quark densities are of comparable magnitude .",
    "another possibility is to separate quarks and antiquarks in the target using charged kaons .",
    "@xmath31 are produced by favored fragmentation of @xmath32 quarks , whose distribution has both a valence and a sea component , while @xmath33 are produced from @xmath34 , which occurs in the sea only . assuming identical transverse momentum distributions of strange quarks and antiquarks in the nucleon , @xmath35 , and neglecting differences in unfavored fragmentation , one expects the @xmath33 to have a broader @xmath36 distribution than the @xmath31 .",
    "an alternative experimental test of the different intrinsic @xmath2 distributions of valence and sea quarks would be comparing the transverse momentum distributions of dileptons ( drell  yan pairs ) produced in @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions .",
    "the pairs are produced in the annihilation of a quark and and antiquark from the two colliding hadrons . in @xmath6 collisions this is possible with valence quarks and antiquarks , while in @xmath37 the sea is involved in at least one of the protons .",
    "we therefore expect a broader dilepton @xmath38 distribution in @xmath5 than in @xmath6 in the same kinematics .",
    "again , such measurements would be most instructive at quark / antiquark momentum fractions @xmath39 , where valence and sea quark densities are of comparable magnitude .",
    "much more insight could be gained from measurements of hadron correlations between the current and the target fragmentation regions of semi  inclusive dis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sidis]b).@xcite such measurements could unravel the semi  inclusive production mechanism by answering the question what `` balances '' the observed @xmath23 of hadrons in the current fragmentation region  other current fragments , central rapidity hadrons , or target fragments .",
    "they could discriminate between scattering from sea and valence quarks by providing information on the hadronic products of the remnant system ( charge , flavor , multiplicities ) . under certain conditions",
    "they could even reveal the non  perturbative short  range correlations between sea quarks induced by chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this would require a rapidity interval @xmath40 for clean separation of the current and target regions , moderate scales @xmath41 to avoid pqcd radiation , and access to quark / antiquark momentum fractions @xmath30 where the non  perturbative sea is large ; these conditions could be met in a `` window '' of moderate @xmath42 center  of  mass energies @xmath43 .",
    "such measurements could ideally be performed with a medium  energy eic with appropriate forward hadron detection capabilities.@xcite + * notice : * authored by jefferson science associates , llc under u.s .",
