    "from the earliest studies of the dynamics of our solar system to the first attempts to apply quantum mechanics to the simplest atoms ( hydrogen and helium ) , few - body systems have played a pivotal role . in particular , the problem of two particles interacting via a central force law is familiar to students of physics .",
    "after elimination of the center - of - mass motion the two - body problem is reduced to a one - body problem in the relative co - ordinate .",
    "the well - known two - body gravitational and the coulomb problems admit exact analytical solutions , which can be tested by experiments .    the few - body problem is still of great interest , especially in view of recent experimental advancements in the area of ultra - cold atoms.@xcite in these experiments neutral atoms are first cooled to nano - kelvin temperatures and then confined in an optical lattice formed by standing wave laser beams , where there are as few as two - and three atoms per lattice site .",
    "typically , the lattice sites confining the atoms may be regarded as harmonic oscillator potentials with a trapping frequency @xmath0 of a few tens of cycles per second .",
    "the coupling between the harmonic oscillator wells ( that is , between the lattice sites ) may be controlled by the intensity of the laser beams . in the limit of low tunneling",
    ", the individual wells may be regarded as independent three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic oscillators .",
    "the strength of the pair - wise interaction between the atoms on each site may be fine - tuned by sweeping through a static magnetic field using a feshbach resonance.@xcite at nano - kelvin temperatures quantum effects dominate , and we thus have what amounts to a non - relativistic quantum few - body system whose inter - particle interactions can be controlled at will .",
    "this achievement is truly remarkable , and such ultra - cold matter experiments can serve as ideal laboratories to investigate the quantum few - body problem .",
    "the experimental group of stferle _",
    "et al._@xcite has trapped two @xmath1k atoms in a 3d harmonic oscillator well , and by tuning near the feshbach resonance , can make the inter - particle interaction strong enough to form diatomic molecules . because the two atoms ( each of which behaves as a fermion@xcite ) occupy distinct hyperfine states , they may still interact in the relative @xmath2-state .",
    "subsequently , the energy of the state is deduced by dissociating the molecule using an rf - pulse and measuring the binding energy of the molecule .",
    "the binding energy as a function of the strength of the interaction ( which is related to the @xmath2-wave scattering length ) is mapped out by by sweeping a magnetic field using a feshbach resonance . in these experiments",
    "the atoms form only loosely bound pairs so that the interaction range may be taken to be very small compared to the size of the two - body system .",
    "this system is then an experimental realization of the exactly solvable problem of two harmonically trapped particles interacting via a zero - range pair - wise potential at zero temperature .    in this article",
    "we present the exact solution to this quantum two - body problem , assuming only a knowledge of quantum mechanics at the senior undergraduate or beginning graduate student level .",
    "remarkably , this ostensibly simple problem has only been investigated within the last 10 years,@xcite and now enjoys a new life due to its relevance to the experiments discussed in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the theoretical spectrum of this system is in excellent agreement with the experimental spectrum we have described.@xcite our approach does not make any reference to the shape of the short - range two - body potential , and requires only that its range be much smaller than the oscillator length ,  @xcite which serves as a natural measure of the particle spacing .",
    "this approach beautifully illustrates the notion of shape - independence of potentials ( for low energy scattering and binding ) that was first developed in the context of nuclear physics.@xcite shape - independence is embodied in the effective range expansion , which is explained and derived in ref .  .",
    "the concepts of scattering length and effective range that come in this expansion are important in the analysis of the experimental results with ultra - cold atoms , and readers are encouraged to study the excellent discussion of these topics in ref .  .",
    "we shall make use of these concepts and show that the energy levels of this system are independent of the shape of the interaction potential in the limit of zero range .",
    "this result is accomplished by noting that , for a harmonic trap , the center of mass motion may be isolated , and the interacting relative motion may be written as a one - body problem .",
    "the irregular solution of the harmonic oscillator wave function , which is normally discarded in the noninteracting problem , will be shown to be the relevant solution for the zero - range interacting case .",
    "this realization paves the way for a gentle introduction to the concept of a pseudopotential in the form of a regularized delta function .",
    "the zero - range pseudopotential , first introduced by fermi,@xcite and applied to the many - body problem by huang and yang,@xcite is extensively used in the current literature of ultra - cold gases.@xcite the same pseudopotential has also been used to study the spectrum of two particles interacting by a zero - range potential in a spherical harmonic oscillator well.@xcite rather than taking this path , we shall follow the derivation of jonsell,@xcite which is in the same spirit as our initial intuitive approach . in sec .",
    "iii we finish with some concluding remarks and suggestions for future research in this area .",
    "we first consider the problem of two identical bosons , each of mass @xmath3 , in the absence of a confining potential .",
    "the bosons interact with a short - range central potential .",
    "most of what follows in this section also applies to fermionic atoms in the spin - singlet state , or to nucleons in the @xmath2-state with an antisymmetric spin - isospin wave function.@xcite in the relative co - ordinate @xmath4 the @xmath2-state asymptotic scattering wave function for positive energy @xmath5 is given by u(r)=r(r ) ~(kr+(k ) ) , ( r > b ) .",
    "[ phase ] we have @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the range of the potential . the effective range expansion , relating the phase shift to the scattering length @xmath8 and the effective range @xmath9 is given by@xcite k ( k)=-+ r_0k^2-pr_0 ^ 3k^4+qr_0 ^ 5k^6 +  [ effective ] potentials of different shapes may have identical values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are shape - dependent .",
    "figure 1 schematically illustrates the zero - energy wave function @xmath12 for an attractive square - well potential ,    , and the dashed line the extrapolated asymptote .",
    "( a ) shallow well with negative scattering length .",
    "( b ) depth tuned to @xmath13 with @xmath14 corresponding to the zero energy bound sate .",
    "( c ) a deeper well supporting only one bound state and positive scattering length .",

    "figure  1 depicts a situation where the intercept of the the zero - energy wave function ( or its extrapolation ) on the horizontal axis is the scattering length @xmath8 , with its sign signifying the presence or absence of a bound state . for a shallow potential that supports no bound state ,",
    "the scattering length @xmath8 is negative ( fig .",
    "when the depth of the potential is increased and fine - tuned as in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the system has a zero - energy `` bound '' state corresponding to @xmath19 . for this limiting case the dimensionless quantity @xmath20 equals @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath22 for other two - parameter attractive potentials are listed in ref .  .",
    "a further increase in the depth results in supporting only one bound state , and the scattering length @xmath8 is shown to be positive ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the depth of the potential becomes still stronger to support two or more bound states . for the case of the square - well example",
    ", it may be shown that the @xmath2-wave scattering length is given by@xcite [ eq : above ] a = b(1- ) .",
    "therefore @xmath23 signals the appearance of the next zero - energy bound state , with the scattering length changing sign .",
    "a further increase results in two bound states .",
    "note from eq .   that the scattering length @xmath8 depends on the range @xmath7 of the potential and its strength @xmath22 .",
    "in what follows we shall be interested in taking the zero - range limit of the interaction , while keeping the strength parameter @xmath22 fixed .    the effective range @xmath9 is proportional to the range @xmath7 of the potential , and goes to zero as @xmath24 .",
    "for this case eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) reduces to k = - .",
    "[ ex ] for positive @xmath8 we may extrapolate eq .   to a bound state .",
    "note that the s - matrix for the @xmath2-state is defined as @xmath25 , and the s - matrix has a simple pole for each bound state in the upper half of the imaginary @xmath26-axis on the complex @xmath26-plane.@xcite a zero - range potential can support only one bound state . at a bound state",
    "therefore , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the relation ( [ ex ] ) for a zero - range potential then reduces to @xmath29 .",
    "hence the binding energy @xmath30 , and the bound state wave function @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 equation  ( [ scat ] ) is exact for a zero - range potential . if @xmath9 is nonzero , the relations for @xmath33 and the asymptotic ( @xmath16 ) wave function @xmath34 are approximately true only if the binding @xmath33 is close to zero , which implies that @xmath35 , and the system is large in size compared to the range of the potential . as an example where these conditions are only marginally satisfied , consider the deuteron , which is the lightest stable atomic nucleus , and is a bound state of a neutron and a proton .",
    "the n - p scattering length in the @xmath2-state ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) is @xmath38fm , and @xmath39fm , where @xmath40 m . equation  ( [ binding ] ) for the binding energy gives @xmath41mev , compared with the experimental value of @xmath42 mev.@xcite    because @xmath9 is nonzero but is much smaller than @xmath8 , this agreement could be improved by taking the next term in the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) .",
    "following the same extrapolation for the bound state at @xmath27 , we obtain the quadratic equation = + r_0 ^2 .",
    "we select only the root that gives @xmath43 when @xmath44 and @xmath45 and obtain [ formula ] = ( 1- ) .",
    "equation   for the deuteron gives @xmath46mev , which is close to the experimental value.@xcite    we have assumed that the size of the bound two - body system is much larger than the range of the potential responsible for the binding .",
    "the details of the potential at short distances do not manifest themselves significantly in the wave function , and the binding is determined by the low energy scattering parameters .",
    "it should therefore be possible to design an effective potential that reproduces the shape - independent results we have obtained .",
    "such an effective one - parameter pseudopotential is easily derived using the wave function @xmath31 given by eq .",
    "( [ scat ] ) . from the relation",
    "@xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "if we identify @xmath49 , we may write -^2 + 4a ^3(r ) r=- .",
    "[ point ] we see that the pseudopotential v(r)=4a ^3(r ) r [ ap2 ] reproduces the earlier results for the wave function and the binding energy of any zero - range potential with a given scattering length .",
    "in the many - body problem of an ultra - cold dilute gas , where @xmath50 , and the average distance between the particles is much larger than the range @xmath7 of the potential , the same regularized pseudopotential in eq .",
    "is widely used.@xcite note that @xmath51 in the limit @xmath52 is @xmath53 for a wave function that is well - behaved at the origin .",
    "in addition , it also gives a finite result for the irregular @xmath31 that goes as @xmath54 , which is more relevant for our problem .",
    "first consider the case of noninteracting particles .",
    "each particle of mass @xmath3 moves in a harmonic potential @xmath55 .",
    "if we make the usual transformations to center - of - mass and relative co - ordinates , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , and their corresponding canonical momenta @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we obtain h_0=(+ m_cm^2r^2 ) + ( + ^2 r^2 ) , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we concentrate on the relative motion and divide the relative distance @xmath62 by @xmath63 and the energy @xmath5 by @xmath64 . in terms of",
    "the dimensionless scaled variables @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , the schrdinger equation for the relative wave function @xmath68 in the @xmath2-state is given by -+x^2 u = u .",
    "[ wave ] the regular ground state solution is @xmath69 , corresponding to @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , or @xmath72 . it is easily checked that eq .   is also satisfied for @xmath73 by @xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath75 with @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "although normalizable and lower in energy , it is excluded as a valid solution in the noninteracting problem because at @xmath78 , the kinetic operator @xmath79 acting on @xmath80 would yield a delta function .",
    "the situation changes for the zero - range interaction that we have been considering .",
    "at @xmath81 we may ignore the harmonic confinement , and the wave function is given by eq .",
