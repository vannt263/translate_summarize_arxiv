    "theoretical analyses of the tidal interaction between close binaries can be classified according to whether an equilibrium tide is assumed or the dynamical tide is taken into account .",
    "the theory of the equilibrium tide is based on the assumption that a star subject to the tidal disturbance of a companion instantly adjusts to hydrostatic equilibrium ( darwin  1879 ) . a calculation including the dynamical tide takes into account the fact that gravity or g  modes can be excited in the convectively stable layers of the star and that resonances between the tidal disturbance and the normal modes of the star can occur ( cowling  1941 ) .",
    "so far , dynamical tides have been studied only in massive close binaries , which have a convective core and a radiative envelope ( zahn  1975 , 1977 ; savonije  & papaloizou  1983 , 1984 , 1997 ; papaloizou  & savonije  1985 , 1997 ; savonije , papaloizou  & alberts  1995 ) .    in this paper , we examine the effect of dynamical tides excited by a companion on a solar  type star , in which a radiative core is surrounded by a convective envelope .",
    "this is of particular interest in connection with circularization of solar  type binaries .",
    "it has been proposed that circularization occurs through the action of turbulent viscosity , originating in the convective envelope , on the tide .",
    "however , according to claret  & cunha  ( 1997 ) ( see also goodman  & oh  1997 ) , who have used the equilibrium tide formalism of zahn  ( 1989 ) , the circularization rate resulting from this mechanism is too small by about two orders of magnitude to account for the circularization timescales required on the main sequence .",
    "the tidal response calculation undertaken here is also of interest in connection with the newly discovered planets , some of which are found to orbit around solar  type stars with a period comparable to that of the high order g  modes of the star .",
    "one such example is 51  pegasi ( mayor  & queloz  1995 ; marcy  & butler  1995 ) .    in these binaries ,",
    "g  mode oscillations are excited by the companion in the radiative region beneath the convective envelope .",
    "they become evanescent in the convection zone where they are damped by their interaction with the convective eddies .",
    "this dissipation leads to an exchange of angular momentum between the star and the orbit if the stellar rotation and the orbital motion are not synchronized .",
    "here we assume that the orbital frequency is initially larger than the rotational frequency of the star .",
    "then tidal interaction results in the decay of the orbit and the spin up of the star .",
    "if the mass of the secondary companion is considerably smaller than that of the primary , the timescale for orbital decay is smaller than the stellar spin up timescale , and the companion eventually plunges into the primary .",
    "but if the mass of the companion is large enough , synchronization may occur before the binary has merged , stopping further orbital decay .",
    "estimates based on the theory of the equilibrium tide ( rasio _ et al . _  1996",
    "; marcy _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) suggest that the orbital decay timescale and the stellar spin up timescale for a system like 51  pegasi are longer than the inferred age of the primary if the companion is a jovian like planet .    in this paper",
    "we examine the effect of resonances on these timescales , and determine the potentially observable magnitude of dynamical tides at the photosphere of a solar  type star .",
    "we also compare the dynamical tide calculations with the results of an asymptotic analysis we carry out in the limit of small frequencies which should correspond to the adiabatic equilibrium tide theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : analysis ] , we study the tidal response of the star to the perturbation by a companion in a circular orbit with a period in the range 413 days . in   [ sec : linearized ] , we first consider the linear adiabatic response and then , away from resonance with a g  mode , extend the analysis using first order perturbation theory to calculate the torque due to dissipation in the convective envelope . this mechanism is then found to be more important than non  adiabaticity arising from heat transport in the radiative interior ( i.e. radiative damping ) . however",
    ", this is not the case in the vicinity of a g  mode resonance .",
    "there we also calculate the torque due to non  adiabaticity in the radiative core using a wkb treatment of the non  adiabatic terms .",
    "we find that the torque at effective resonances is mainly determined by radiative damping .",
    "an analysis valid for very low frequencies ( _ equilibrium tide _ ) is given in ",
    "[ sec : asy ] .",
    "the orbital circularization timescale for systems initially in non ",
    "circular orbits can be derived from the response calculations for companions in circular orbits .",
    "this is done in   [ sec : times ] .",
    "we then discuss how this might be used to calibrate the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity required to fit the observations in ",
    "[ sec : cal ] .",
    "numerical calculations are presented in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the results assuming the equilibrium tide are given in ",
    "[ sec : eqres ] . in ",
    "[ sec : dyres ] we present the results of the dynamical tide calculations .",
    "we describe the tidal response of the star to a companion in circular orbit , give the induced velocity at its surface and the tidal torque .",
    "we describe the resonances and show that , for the periods of interest of several days , they are not expected to affect the orbital evolution of the binary . in   [ sec : comp ] we compare the calculations based on the dynamical and equilibrium tides .",
    "we find that , for the standard solar model , at the orbital periods of interest , because of the long timescale associated with convection , the equilibrium tide calculations give a relatively poor approximation to the results of the dynamical tide calculations .",
    "we find that the viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization rates is about 50 times larger than that simply estimated from mixing length theory and discuss the means by which this viscosity might be enhanced in   [ sec : calibration ] .",
    "however , we note that _ the strength of the resonances for orbital periods larger than @xmath0 days and the perturbed velocity at the surface of the star are insensitive to the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity assumed_. only for periods @xmath1 days is the strength of the resonances decreased by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "the observable width of the resonances as well is reduced when the viscosity is increased .",
    "we also give the relation between the orbital evolution , circularization and spin up timescales and the orbital frequency in   [ sec : fitting ] .    finally in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss and summarize our results , applying them to 51  pegasi in  [ sec : peg ] .",
    "the calculations presented in this section will be applied to close binary systems where the primary is a solar  type star and the secondary a stellar or planetary companion .",
    "the orbital periods of interest lie in the range @xmath2@xmath3 days .",
    "the rotational angular velocity of the primary is assumed to be small compared to the orbital frequency , so that it can be neglected .",
    "quadrupolar tidal forcing thus occurs through potential perturbations with periods in the range @xmath4@xmath5 days .",
    "when calculating the tidal response well away from a condition of resonance with a g  mode , we firstly calculate the tidal response assuming it to be adiabatic throughout the star . first ",
    "order perturbation theory is then used to calculate the dissipation occurring in the convective envelope .",
    "the idea here ( as is borne out by the numerical results ) is that although short wavelength g  modes are excited in the radiative core , when they are away from resonance they do not play an important role in comparison to the global component of the tidal response .",
    "also the variations in the convective envelope occur on a comparatively long length scale , making the adiabatic approximation a reasonable one .",
    "when there is a resonance with a high order g  mode , the response becomes one with a very short length scale such that non ",
    "adiabaticity in the radiative core can not be neglected .",
    "however , the modes are of high order such that a wkb treatment of the non  adiabatic effects is possible and this is used close to resonance where the normal mode dominates the response . such non  adiabatic effects turn out to be more important than the action of turbulent viscosity in the convective envelope , with the torque at significant resonances being determined mainly by non  adiabatic effects .        the linearized momentum , mass , and energy equations governing the adiabatic response of the non  rotating star to the perturbing potential @xmath6 may be written ( see , for example , unno _ et al . _  1989 )",

    "we use the cowling  ( 1941 ) approximation , applicable to stars with high central condensation , which neglects the perturbation to the stellar gravitational potential .",
    "we also have the thermodynamic relation    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the temperature and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the adiabatic exponents of chandrasekhar .",
    "this relation together with equation  ( [ energy ] ) leads to    @xmath17    where    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the brunt - visl frequency and @xmath20 the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "following cowling  ( 1941 ) , only the dominant quadrupole term is considered in the perturbing potential due to the companion . for a binary system with a circular orbit",

    "we adopt the same angular and time dependence for the perturbations , so that @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are proportional to @xmath35 .",

    "the interaction between convective motions and the tidal flow is expected to lead to the dissipation of tidally excited waves ( e.g. zahn  1977 ) .",
    "we model this effect as arising from a turbulent viscosity .",
    "to do this we suppose there is an additional dissipative force per unit mass acting in the convection zone given in spherical coordinates by :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the flow velocity and @xmath56 is the turbulent viscosity . here",
    ", we assume that variation in the radial direction is the most significant and note that the viscous force is defined in such a way as to lead to a positive definite energy dissipation rate .    for the turbulent viscosity coefficient",
    ", we take ( see , for example , xiong , cheng  & deng  1997 )    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are two constants , @xmath58 being on the order of unity , @xmath60 is the orbital period , @xmath61 is the mixing length , and @xmath62 is the convective timescale .",
    "the viscosity is then @xmath63 for small forcing frequency @xmath64 .",
    "the factor @xmath65 , where we shall use @xmath66 , allows for a reduction of efficiency of the damping of high frequency oscillations to which the convection can not adjust .",
    "a similar prescription with @xmath67 has been proposed by zahn  ( 1966 ) and used by zahn  ( 1989 ) , whereas @xmath66 has been considered by goldreich  & keeley  ( 1977 ) and used by campbell  & papaloizou  ( 1983 ) and goldman  & mazeh  ( 1991 ) .",
    "goodman  & oh  ( 1997 ) have also recently put forward some arguments in favor of @xmath66 . for the mixing length",
    ", we shall take the standard relation @xmath68 and set @xmath69 .    in principle",
    ", equations  ( [ momentum])([energy ] ) should be solved with @xmath70 added on the right hand side of equation  ( [ momentum ] ) in the convective envelope . however",
    ", this would increase the order of the differential system to be solved and make the numerical calculations much more complicated .",
    "instead , we have found it adequate to solve first the adiabatic problem and then to treat the dissipative effect using a first ",
    "order perturbation theory .",
    "this is valid everywhere , except very close to resonances , because dissipation is weak enough so that the imaginary parts of @xmath42 and @xmath39 are much smaller in magnitude than their real parts .",
    "thus we solve equations  ( [ momentum])([energy ] ) without dissipative terms , and use these ( real ) solutions to calculate the rate of energy dissipation @xmath71 due to convection which is given by :    @xmath72    where the integration is over the volume @xmath73 of the convective envelope and the angular dependence of @xmath70 and @xmath55 has to be taken into account . using the relation @xmath74 and the expression  ( [ xi ] ) for @xmath11 , we get    @xmath75 dr , \\label{pt1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the inner and outer radius of the convective envelope . noting that the ratio of the rate of exchange of energy and angular momentum with the orbit is given by the pattern speed of the tidal disturbance , @xmath78 the torque exerted by the companion on the star is given by    @xmath79    this torque is positive because the star is non  rotating .",
    "when the frequency of the tidal wave is equal to that of some adiabatic normal mode frequency of the star , we can no longer use first  order perturbation theory because it would give an infinite torque .",
    "however , when the frequency @xmath28 is very close to a resonant frequency @xmath80 , the torque will be given by an expression of the form    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is an amplitude and @xmath83 is the damping rate for the mode . first ",
    "order perturbation theory assumes dissipative effects are small in the response calculation .",
    "therefore it is valid only for frequencies such that @xmath84 .",
    "however , the damping rate , if small , can be found from first ",
    "order perturbation theory applied , as described above , very close to resonance where the mode dominates the response .",
    "then it is given by ( see , for example , goldstein  1980 )    @xmath85    very close to resonance , where @xmath86 is the kinetic energy of the mode :    @xmath87 ^2 dv = \\frac{24 \\pi}{5 } m^2 \\omega^2 \\int_0^{r_{\\sun } } \\rho r^2 \\left ( \\xi_r^2 + 6 \\xi_h^2 \\right ) dr,\\ ] ]    the integration being over the volume @xmath88 of the star ( in the first integral , the angular dependence of @xmath55 has to be taken into account ) . in  ( [ gamma ] ) , the total energy of the mode is @xmath89 because at resonance there is equipartition between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "we calculate @xmath83 using ( [ gamma ] ) as outlined above making sure that @xmath28 is close enough to @xmath80 by checking that @xmath83 remains approximately constant when @xmath28 is slightly changed .",
    "to get @xmath90 we fit the torque obtained from first ",
    "order perturbation theory to the expression  ( [ restor ] ) in the region approaching the resonance where still @xmath91 .",
    "this procedure works satisfactorily when @xmath83 is small with consequent strong resonances .",
    "this appears to be the situation when turbulent viscosity alone is assumed to act .",
    "however , radiative damping can not be neglected for resonances at low forcing frequency and this is discussed below .",
    "non  adiabatic effects become important when the radiative diffusion time across the length scale associated with the tidal response shortens to become comparable to the wave propagation time across the star . in principle , these effects should be taken into account both in the radiative core and above the convection zone . however , since g  modes , which are excited in the radiative core , are evanescent in the convective envelope , we do not expect non  adiabaticity to play an important role above the convection zone .",
    "to take into account non  adiabatic effects , equation  ( [ energy ] ) has to be modified in the radiative core to :    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the perturbed radiative flux .",
    "the radiative flux is given by the radiative diffusion equation    @xmath94    where @xmath14 is the temperature and @xmath95 is the radiative conductivity , with @xmath96 being the stefan ",

    "we now suppose that close to resonance , the response behaves exactly like a free g  mode with very large radial wavenumber @xmath102 so that wkb theory can be used together with the local dispersion relation to evaluate @xmath103 .",
    "the dominant term in the right  hand side of  ( [ grflux ] ) is then @xmath104 , and all the other terms can be neglected . for a high order free g  mode ,",
    "the local dispersion relation gives ( see , for example , unno _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) :    @xmath105    this expression of @xmath102 is derived under the adiabatic approximation . however , since we want to incorporate non ",
    "adiabatic effects to the lowest order , we do not need to take them into account in evaluating @xmath102 .",
    "we have @xmath106 in the radiative core because @xmath107 there .",
    "the perturbed temperature @xmath108 can be expressed as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath33 using the thermodynamic relation    @xmath109    where @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the equation of state in the radiative core of a solar  type star is primarly that of a perfect gas ( we neglect here the radiation pressure which is very small compared to the gas pressure ) .",
    "we then have @xmath112 and @xmath113 . using the above , the fact that @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the relation  ( [ thermo ] ) , we can recast  ( [ nad ] ) under the form    @xmath116    where    @xmath117    for high order free g  modes ,",

    "the non  adiabatic correction of the term associated with pressure in equation  ( [ nad1 ] ) is then very small compared to the non  adiabatic correction of the term involving @xmath42 .",
    "therefore equation  ( [ nad1 ] ) can be approximated by    @xmath120    where we have defined @xmath121 .",
    "we note that because we have identified the tidal response with a normal mode , this calculation is valid only close to resonances .",
    "equation  ( [ rhopnad ] ) is similar to  ( [ rhop ] ) but with @xmath122 being replaced by @xmath123 . the system of differential equations we have to solve to get the non ",
    "adiabatic response of the star is then the same as  ( [ ode1])([ode2 ] ) but with the following modification in the radiative core . in equations",
    "( [ ode1 ] ) and  ( [ ode2 ] ) , @xmath124 where it appears as a coefficient of @xmath42 , has to be replaced by @xmath123 .",
    "the system of differential equations so obtained is complex .",
    "in general , for the periods we consider , @xmath125 is small .",
    "we then calculate both the real and imaginary parts of the response , so that the torque can be computed directly from :    @xmath126    where the integral is over the volume @xmath88 of the star .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath33 has to be taken into account in this expression .",
    "equation  ( [ torgen ] ) can be recast under the form ( savonije  & papaloizou  1983 ) :    @xmath127    as in   [ sec : torque ] , we can calculate the damping rate @xmath128 in resonances due to non ",

    "the torque may be calculated using equations  ( [ pt1 ] ) and  ( [ det ] ) .",
    "however , we comment that equation  ( [ xieq ] ) , which states that the lagrangian perturbation to the pressure is zero , can only be derived in the adiabatic low @xmath129 limit if the brunt - visl frequency is not zero ( in practice , one also requires that the forcing period be short compared to the thermal timescale of the star , but the latter is so long that it can be assumed to be infinite in this context ) .",
    "equations  ( [ xieq])([weq ] ) do not apply in a finite region where strictly @xmath133 in that case the fluid is locally barotropic , and the displacement can be written as the gradient of a potential :    @xmath134.\\ ] ]    the continuity equation then gives for low frequencies    @xmath135    equation  ( [ crp ] ) gives a second order differential equation for @xmath136 this applies inside the region where @xmath133 it is possible , using the two available boundary conditions for  ( [ crp ] ) , to match @xmath137 given by  ( [ xieq ] ) at the boundaries of such a region , but not in general @xmath138 given by  ( [ weq ] ) .",
    "this means that there will tend to be a discontinuity in the tangential displacement at the boundaries for low frequencies .",
    "when @xmath139 is not zero but very small , in particular small compared to @xmath140 which corresponds physically to the convective timescale being much longer than the forcing period , the tidal response more closely matches that given by  ( [ crp ] ) than that given by equations  ( [ xieq])([weq ] ) .",
    "this feature causes a very slow convergence towards the low frequency limiting solution ( _ equilibrium tide _ ) found here , as well as near discontinuous behavior near the inner convective envelope boundary .",
    "this is borne out by our numerical results ( see   [ sec : velocity ] and   [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "the torque , @xmath141 gives the rate at which angular momentum is transferred from the orbit to the star .",
    "we can then calculate a tidal evolution ( decay ) timescale of the circular orbit :    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is the reduced mass . in principle , the variation of the torque with @xmath28 has to be taken into account for the total decay time to be calculated .",
    "however , since the torque increases as the companion spirals in , @xmath144 is mainly determined by the initial position of the companion , and a good estimate can be obtained using the above formula .",
    "this exchange of angular momentum also results in the spin up of the star , the timescale of which is given by @xmath145 ( savonije  & papaloizou  1983 ) , with @xmath146 being the stellar moment of inertia .",
    "out of resonance , angular momentum deposition _ initially _ occurs mainly in the convective envelope where the turbulent viscosity acts ( goldreich  & nicholson  1989 ) .",
    "it is then of interest to calculate the spin up timescale for the convective envelope alone , which is @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the moment of inertia of the convection zone .",
    "we note however that on the long timescales associated with tidal evolution , angular momentum may be redistributed throughout the star .      in practice ,",
    "we find that the torque arising from a companion in a circular orbit varies with frequency approximately @xmath149 this result can be used to relate the orbital circularization timescale to the initial orbital decay timescale provided that the eccentricity is not too large . in practice ,",
    "both these timescales can be significantly longer than the spin up timescale of the star due to its relatively small moment of inertia .",
    "we should then consider that the star is synchronized with the orbit .",
    "the ratio between the orbital decay timescale and the circularization timescale @xmath150 is found to be about 6 for the calculated frequency dependence of the circular orbit torque ( see , for example , the expressions given in savonije  & papaloizou  1983 , 1984 ) .",
    "this appears to be independent of whether the star is assumed to be synchronously rotating or non  rotating in that the circularization rate calculated assuming no rotation , as we do here , gives a reasonable estimate in the synchronous case also .",
    "in addition , to evaluate @xmath150 for an equal mass system , we have to take into account the reciprocal torque exerted by the primary on the companion .",
    "to do this , we take @xmath150 to be proportional to a factor which is @xmath151 when @xmath152 and 1 when @xmath153 . to a reasonable approximation , we then get :    @xmath154      one of the purposes of this paper is to calculate the tidally induced velocities on the star . in order to do this , the processes responsible for dissipating the disturbance should be included as accurately as possible .",
    "an important dissipation process is that associated with turbulent friction in the convection zone .",
    "as this process has been suggested as being responsible for circularizing the orbits of main sequence binaries of sufficiently short period ( see mathieu  1994 ) , we investigate whether reasonable assumptions about the behavior of turbulent viscosity can lead to the observed circularization rates .",
    "zahn  & bouchet  ( 1989 ) have investigated the pre ",
    "main sequence evolution of late  type binaries in which the stars are fully convective .",
    "the main conclusion of their work was that circularization occurs at the very beginning of the hayashi phase , with hardly any decrease of the eccentricity on the main sequence .",
    "the cutoff period they predict is between 7.3 and 8.5  days . according to them ,",
    "observations show a cutoff period around 8  days independent on the age of the star and are then in agreement with their results .",
    "however , we note that for this agreement to be reached , some observations had to be discarded . those by mayor  & mermilliod  ( 1984 ) , which indicated that the cutoff period of late  type binaries was at most 5.7  days , and those by mathieu  & mazeh  ( 1988 ) , which showed that the cutoff period in the 4  @xmath155 old cluster m  67 was more than 10  days . in a review article ,",
    "mathieu  ( 1994 ) ( see also mathieu  1992 and mathieu _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) has confirmed that `` cutoff periods increase with age , consistent with active main sequence tidal circularization '' .",
    "main sequence cutoff period is very likely to be 4.3  @xmath156 ( an upper limit being 6.4  @xmath156 ) , and cutoff periods for solar  mass binaries are 7.05  @xmath156 in the pleiades ( 0.1  @xmath155 ) , 8.5  @xmath156 in the hyades ( 0.8  @xmath155 ) , 12.4  @xmath156 in m  67 ( 4  @xmath155 ) and 18.7  @xmath156 in the halo field ( 16  @xmath155 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that active circularization does take place for main sequence binaries and that it is less efficient than proposed by zahn  & bouchet  ( 1989 ) on the pre  main sequence .",

    "the fact that we obtain an index close to 13/3 by setting @xmath66 or even @xmath67 ( see below ) , in contrast to the results above , is at least partially due to the effectively smaller value of @xmath59 we used ( see below ) .",

    ", when using a simple estimate of the turbulent viscosity based on mixing length theory for non  rotating stars , the circularization timescale we get from our calculations for this period is 56 times larger than 4  @xmath155 .",
    "this indicates that either + ( i ) solar  type binaries are not circularized through turbulent viscosity acting on tidal perturbations ( but see tassoul  1988 and kumar  & goodman  1996 for other suggested tidal mechanisms ) , or + ( ii ) dissipation in the convective envelope of solar  like stars is significantly more efficient than is currently estimated .",
    "tassoul  ( 1995 ) postulates that efficient tidal dissipation occurs in a very thin eckman layer close to the surface of a tidally deformed star and that this process greatly increases the efficiency of tidal interactions . but",
    "a refutation of the notion that the free surface boundary condition appropriate to the tidally deformed star , rather than the more common rigid boundary condition , leads to such an effective boundary layer , has been given by rieutord  & zahn  ( 1997 ) .",
    "further tassoul  & tassoul  ( 1997 ) state that their mechanism is inapplicable to extreme mass ratio cases such as 51  pegasi that we consider later in the paper .",

    "if we assume that the non  linear development of the parametric instability and subsequent dissipation of the excited modes leads to an effective viscosity , and frictional dissipation rate @xmath227 which is big enough to suppress the linear instability , then we expect from the classical theory of darwin  ( 1879 ) that there will be a phase lag @xmath228 associated with the tide given by    @xmath229    for a binary of unit mass ratio and period @xmath230  @xmath156 , synchronization occurs on a timescale very much shorter than that required for circularization , so that we assume that the stellar rotation is synchronized with the orbit and @xmath231 in the calculation of @xmath232 for small eccentricity , the circularization timescale @xmath150 is approximately given by @xmath233 , where the apsidal motion frequency is @xmath234 , with @xmath235 being the apsidal motion constant ( cowling  1938 ) .",
    "we use the equilibrium tide value  ( [ xieq ] ) to estimate @xmath236 at @xmath225 as @xmath237 for a mass ratio of unity .",

    "however , we stress that this has not been shown from a full non  linear calculation of the development of parametric instability .      in general , a large increase in the simply estimated turbulent viscosity coefficient",
    "is needed in order to explain the observed circularization rate .",
    "we now investigate what is needed to achieve this and give the numerical results of tests we have carried out . in all cases , we have checked that _ the velocity at the surface of the star is not sensitive to the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity assumed_.    in addition , as indicated above , the resonances are essentially controlled by radiative damping in the radiative core as long as @xmath242 .",
    "when the turbulent viscosity is enhanced , @xmath83 is increased",
    ". however , in the tests we present below , for orbital periods larger than @xmath0 days , @xmath128 stays large enough compared to @xmath83 so that , although the non resonant torques increase , the central structure and strength of the resonances is determined by radiative damping . for orbital periods on the order of @xmath1 days",
    ", @xmath83 can become comparable to @xmath128 .",
    "then the damping factor in  [ restor ] has to be replaced by @xmath243 , and the strength of the resonance is reduced by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "we first consider the effect on the circularization timescale of _ varying the parameters _",

    "note that the denominator we used in this expression is @xmath244 rather than @xmath245 using the latter with @xmath246 is equivalent to setting @xmath247 in the former . at present",

    ", we need @xmath282 between 0.4 and 0.5 with @xmath157 . in the model",
    "we have adopted , the effect is of less importance for shorter periods because the number of oscillations of the response in the region of the radiative core where turbulent dissipation is introduced decreases with forcing frequency .",
    "therefore , the torque does not vary with @xmath28 as a simple power law with an index close to 4 .",
    "however , in reality , the effectiveness of the turbulent viscosity should be reduced for short wavelength disturbances giving a compensating effect to make it relatively less effective at low frequencies .",
    "the above calculations show that overshooting is not likely to be efficient enough to decrease the circularization timescales by a factor of about 50 . to get such an effect , we indeed require an extent of overshoot below the convection zone at least 5 or 10 times larger than that deduced from the observations .",
    "in addition , we have not taken into account the fact that overshooting leads to an increase of the g  modes length scale through a decrease in the buoyancy or the magnitude of @xmath287 this in turn would decrease the amount of turbulent dissipation associated with overshooting .      as we have already mentioned above , _",
    "calculations based on both the dynamical and equilibrium tide theories give a torque proportional to the orbital frequency raised to a power @xmath1 _ ( see  [ asyint ] and  [ dynint ] ) .",
    "if circularization of solar  type binaries does occur through the action of turbulent viscosity on the tides , then its magnitude has to be calibrated so as to account for the observed timescale .",
    "we have discussed in the previous section , somewhat speculatively , how the required enhancement of the magnitude of the viscosity above that obtained from simple estimates might be envisaged to occur .",
    "since the enhancement might depend on forcing frequency , it is not clear that the resulting torque will still be proportional to the frequency to the @xmath1 .",
    "however , the increase to @xmath288 described above gave torques that approximately preserved this power law so that in the absence of additional information , we shall suppose it holds .",
    "then the calibration acts only to adjust the coefficient of the power law .",
    "we note that the observations do not rule out any exponent between 3 and 5 ( see below ) .",
    "since our calculations can only strictly be applied to solar  type stars , we calibrate our results using @xmath289  @xmath155 for @xmath201  @xmath156 .",
    "this gives ( in cgs ) :",
    "@xmath290    or , equivalently :    @xmath291    the corresponding formul for the orbital and spin up timescales ( in giga ",
    "years ) are :    @xmath292    @xmath293    and @xmath294 ( for the solar model we use , @xmath295  @xmath296 and @xmath297  @xmath296 ) .",
    "since the torque is proportional to @xmath298 we can use the relation  ( [ tcircb ] ) for @xmath150 , so that the circularization time is given by    @xmath299    even though our calculations can only be applied to solar  type stars , it is of interest to compare the circularization timescales we get from  ( [ tcirc ] ) with the observed ones . for @xmath300 , 7.05 , 8.5 and 18.7  @xmath156 , ( [ tcirc ] ) gives respectively @xmath301 , 0.3 , 0.8 and 24  @xmath155 , to be compared with the observed timescales 0.003 , 0.1 , 0.8 and 16  @xmath155 respectively .",
    "the agreement for @xmath302  @xmath156 is within a factor 1.5 . for smaller periods",
    ", circularization is expected to occur when the convective envelopes of the stars are larger , making turbulent dissipation more efficient .",
    "we note that mathieu _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) have already pointed out that a power law @xmath303 provides a close fit to the slope of the observed cutoff periods .",
    "however , the observations are equally well fitted with an index of 10/3 and an index of 16/3 can not be ruled out ( mathieu _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) .",
    "if the simple estimate of the turbulent viscosity based on mixing length theory for non  rotating stars is used , the coefficients in the formul for the torque have to be divided by a factor @xmath304 whereas those in the formul for the timescales have to be multiplied by the same factor .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    ", we have plotted @xmath144 in units @xmath305 and @xmath150 in units @xmath306 versus @xmath28 and @xmath178 in a log  log representation .",
    "it is of interest to apply these results to the system 51  pegasi , for which the orbital period ( assuming the observed oscillations are due to a companion ) is @xmath165  @xmath307 if the companion is a jupiter mass planet ( @xmath308 ) , then the tidal orbital evolution timescale given by  ( [ torb ] ) is @xmath309  @xmath310 the star spin up timescale  ( [ tsp ] ) is @xmath311  @xmath155 and the spin up timescale of the convective envelope is @xmath312  @xmath155 .",
    "all of these timescales are long compared with the inferred age of 51  pegasi ( edvardsson _ et al . _",
    "if the companion is a low - mass star of @xmath313 , as has been recently suggested , @xmath144 is 100 times smaller while @xmath314 and @xmath315 are @xmath316 times smaller .",
    "we then expect the primary star to be synchronized with the orbit , in which case exchange of angular momentum is no longer taking place . synchronization is actually expected if the mass of the companion is larger than about 10 jupiter masses .",
    "the orbital decay timescale is also smaller than the age of the system , but since @xmath317 , tidal interaction stops before the companion has plunged into the central star .",
    "if the simple estimate of the turbulent viscosity based on mixing length theory for non  rotating stars is used , all these timescales have to multiplied by @xmath318 . in that case",
    ", synchronization is expected if the mass of the companion is larger than about 70 jupiter masses .",
    "the planetary companion interpretation has been questioned recently by the reported 4.23  @xmath156 modulation in the line profile of 51  pegasi ( gray  1997 ) , and the possibility that this modulation may be due to g  mode oscillations has been considered ( gray  & hatzes  1997 ) .",
    "we note that , according to our results , such a modulation could not be due to g  mode oscillations tidally driven by a companion . for the oscillation to have a period of @xmath319  @xmath156",
    ", the orbital period would have to be 8.46  @xmath156 .",
    "the maximum perturbed radial velocity at the surface of the star induced by the companion would then be between @xmath172 and 1  @xmath170 for a perturbing mass between @xmath320 and 1 solar mass .",
    "_ these numbers do not depend on the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity assumed , and are not expected to be affected by the possibility of resonance_. these velocities are at least about 50 times smaller than the observed ones .      in this paper , we have studied the dynamical response of the star to the tidal perturbation of a companion . we have computed the torque due to dissipation in the convective envelope using first ",
    "order perturbation theory . in the vicinity of resonance",
    ", we have also calculated the torque due to non  adiabaticity in the radiative core using a wkb treatment .",
    "we have found that the torque at effective resonances is mainly determined by radiative damping .",
    "we have carried out an analysis based on the adiabatic equilibrium tide , and showed that agreement with the dynamical tide calculations can be rather poor . for the unmodified stellar model and the periods of interest of several days , the torque derived using the equilibrium tide is 4 to 6 times larger than that corresponding to the dynamical tide .",
    "we have found that the presence of fixed resonances do not affect the long term orbital evolution of the binary , so that the different timescales ( orbital evolution , circularization and spin up ) are mainly determined by the non  resonant interaction .",
    "our calculations show that the viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization rates of solar  type binaries is @xmath318 times larger than that simply estimated from mixing length theory for non  rotating stars .",
    "we have explored some means by which this viscosity might be enhanced .",
    "we have found that it could become large enough if the magnitude of the brunt - visl frequency in the deep convective envelope were increased sufficiently .",
    "such an increase is expected to be produced by the effect of rotation on convection , but it is questionable whether it can be of sufficient magnitude .",
    "we note that _ the strength of the resonances for orbital periods larger than @xmath0 days and the perturbed velocity at the surface of the star are insensitive to the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity assumed_. only for periods @xmath1 days is the strength of the resonances decreased by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "the effective widths of the resonances affecting the tidal torques as well are reduced when the viscosity is increased .",
