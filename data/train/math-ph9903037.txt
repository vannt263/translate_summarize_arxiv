    "in infinite - dimensional analysis , it is well known that there is deep breaking between the case of banach spaces ( over @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) and that of more general hausdorff locally convex topological vector spaces which are not normed spaces ( see e.g. [ 2 ] or [ 12 ] ) .",
    "for example , depending on the type of derivatives used ( frchet derivatives , gteaux derivatives , ... ) , one obtains non equivalent infinite - dimensional differential calculi , although each of them leads to a taylor expansion at a point ; unfortunately , for these various types of differential calculi , the fundamental theorems of the banach differential calculus such that the  implicit function theorem  or the  frobenius theorem  are no more valid . as a consequence ,",
    "there are several theories of  infinite - dimensional lie groups  depending on the class of groups and underlying manifold structures we consider , ( see e.g.[13 ] ) .    in the non - commutative geometry initiated by a connes ( see [ 5 ] and some references therein ) ,",
    "compact manifolds are replaced by unital @xmath23-algebras which are not assumed to be commutative . in this",
    "setting , one obtains a quantized differential calculus as soon as one can incorporate such an algebra @xmath1 in a  regular spectral triple  , that is to say a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is represented by an unital @xmath23-subalgebra of the @xmath23-algebra @xmath24 of bounded operators on some separable hilbert space @xmath25 , and @xmath26 an unbounded self - adjoint operator on @xmath25 with compact resolvent , such that for every element @xmath27 in @xmath28 $ ] lies in @xmath24 , and such that @xmath1 is contained in the domain @xmath29 of the @xmath30-th power of the derivation @xmath31 $ ] on @xmath24 for every @xmath30 in @xmath32 .    a natural question , which has been already approached in the particular case of gauge groups arising in non - commutative geometry in [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] , can be then roughly formulated as follows : under what conditions the quantized differential calculus associated with a regular spectral triple @xmath0 leads to a tractable notion of  infinite - dimensional lie group  for the group of invertible elements in @xmath1 and some of its important subgroups ?",
    "the present paper , which brings an interesting and rather unexpected answer as soon as the spectral triple fulfils some  goodness  property , is organized as follows .",
    "-in section 1 we recall some basic definitions on smoothness and analyticity in frchet spaces and a group theoretical version of differentiability yielding to the notion of generalized lie group developed in [ 12 ] , which , in spite of the absence of an explicit underlying smooth manifold structure , has the same main functional properties than a  true  lie group .",

    "we prove also that the group @xmath42 of invertible elements in @xmath43 has a natural structure of generalized lie group with lie algebra @xmath1 , and that the associated exponential mapping @xmath44 is analytic .",

    "given a good spectral triple @xmath0 , using our crucial lemma 2 and taking into account that @xmath42 is a nice projective limit of analytic banach lie groups , one obtains our main result ( theorem 5.3 ) : the group @xmath42 has a natural structure of analytic frchet lie group of campbell - baker - hausdorff type ( in the sense of [ 6]-[13 ] ) open in @xmath43 ; in particular , provided with the @xmath2-topology , @xmath1 is an unital frchet good @xmath23-algebra .",

    "-section 5 uses extensively a result of j. leslie and t. robart ( see [ 6 ] , [ 13 ] ) which ensures the integrability of the closed lie subalgebras of the lie algebra of a lie group of campbell - baker - hausdorff type .",
