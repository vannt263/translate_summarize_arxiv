    "high - dimensional problems are notoriously difficult to solve by standard numerical techniques due to the _ curse of dimensionality _  the complexity grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the problems of such kind arise in many different applications in physics , chemistry , biology and engineering , but their study in numerical linear algebra has begun quite recently .",
    "there are not many techniques capable of solving high  dimensional problems efficiently .",
    "the most prominent among them are monte carlo and quasi monte carlo methods , best n - term approximations , and advanced discretization methods such as sparse grids and radial basis functions .",
    "however , all of these methods have their own disadvantages . for example , it is difficult to achieve high accuracy using the monte carlo approach , and sparse grid techniques require sophisticated analytical and algebraic manipulations and still suffer ( in a milder way though ) from the curse of dimensionality , which make them inapplicable for @xmath0    one of the most fruitful ideas for solving high - dimensional problems is the idea of _ separation of variables_. for two variables it boils down to the celebrated schmidt decomposition , which is known on a discrete level as the singular value decomposition ( svd ) , a particular low ",
    "rank decomposition of a matrix .",
    "different generalizations of this idea to higher dimensions , most notable are the canonical ( cp ) and tucker formats , have been studied motivated by the applications in data analysis , particularly chemometrics , see the review  @xcite .",
    "these classical formats have their drawbacks as well , e.g. the canonical format is in general not stable to perturbations , and the tucker format suffers from the curse of dimensionality .",
    "nevertheless , in many applications the canonical representation can be computed efficiently using , e.g.  _ greedy algorithms _",
    "@xcite or by a multigrid accelerated reduced higher order svd combined with the tucker format @xcite , and for the tucker format a quasioptimal approximation can be computed using the svd algorithm  @xcite .",
    "efficient methods for quantum many - body systems are based on low ",
    "parametric tensor product formats .",
    "one of the most successful approaches , the _ density matrix renormalization group _ ( dmrg )",
    "@xcite is an optimization technique that uses the matrix product state ( mps ) representation , see the review @xcite .",
    "the mps and dmrg are described in a problem  specific language , and despite they became the methods of choice for many applications in the solid state physics and quantum chemistry , they were unknown in numerical analysis .",
    "looking for more efficient dimensionality reduction schemes , two groups in the numerical linear algebra community have re - discovered independently successful tensor formats under different names , namely the tree - tucker  @xcite , tensor train ( tt )  @xcite and hierarchical tucker ( ht )  @xcite formats .",
    "the equivalence of the tt and mps format has been shortly discovered and reported in  @xcite .",
    "this connection is very beneficial and fruitful : the idea of the dmrg algorithm has been applied to different kinds of problem in numerical analysis : approximate solution of linear systems @xcite , solution of eigenvalue problems @xcite , dynamics  @xcite , cross interpolation @xcite . at the same time , new tensor formats have been proposed , e.g. the _ quantized _ tensor train ( qtt )  @xcite , and the qtt - tucker  @xcite , and several new results have been obtained for eigenproblems  @xcite , solution of linear systems @xcite , multidimensional convolution  @xcite , multidimensional fourier transform  @xcite , interpolation  @xcite .",
    "the use of different tensor product formats for quantum chemistry problems has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "this paper can be considered as a natural extension of the work  @xcite , where the computation of a single extreme eigenvalue using the ( quantized ) tensor train format was revisited . instead of computing one eigenvalue",
    "we want to compute approximations to several extreme eigenpairs simultaneously .",
    "such problems appear , for example , in the computation of excited states in physics and chemistry .",
    "this generalization is not straightforward , taking into account the special structure of the manifold where the solution is sought .",
    "our approach consists in two key components .",
    "first , all eigenstates are represented in the tt - format in a simultaneous manner ( so - called _ block tt - format _ ) , and the minimization problem is formulated in a rigorous way as a minimization of the block rayleigh quotient .",
    "the optimization problem is then solved by means of alternating optimization with a small but very important trick : instead of using one - and - the same representation for all steps , the auxiliary index corresponding to the eigenstate number is always associated with the currently optimized tt core .",
    "the local problem at each iteration step becomes a linear block eigenvalue problem which can be treated by standard iterative techniques .    at the moment",
    "the draft of this paper was written , frank verstraete and iztok pizorn kindly informed us about the work  @xcite in the mps community , which also addresses solution of the block rayleigh minimization problem in the alternating framework , but the methods described in @xcite differ from the algorithm proposed in this paper .",
    "our algorithm has a better asymptotic complexity with respect to the mode size , but adapts the tt ranks during the iterations like in the dmrg scheme",
    ". this can be particularly important for solving high  dimensional problems with large mode sizes .",
