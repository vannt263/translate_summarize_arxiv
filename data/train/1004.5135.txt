    "they contain 1200 sec of exposure in f606w each .",
    "field s3 contains 4200 sec of exposure in f814w , while s2 contains only 2100 sec in f814w .",
    "the data reduction and photometry for the angst survey are fully described in @xcite . for convenience",
    "we provide a brief summary of the techniques here .",
    "the photometry was measured simultaneously for all of the objects in the uncombined images using the software package hstphot @xcite .",
    "this package is optimized for measuring photometry of stars on wfpc2 images using the well - characterized and stable point spread function ( psf ) calculated with tinytim .",
    "the software fits the psf to all of the stars in each individual frame to find psf magnitudes .",
    "it then determines and applies the aperture correction for each image using the most isolated stars , corrects for the charge transfer efficiency of the wfpc2 detector , combines the results from the individual exposures , and converts the measured count rates to the vegamag system .    the hstphot output",
    "was then filtered to only allow objects classified as stars with signal - to - noise ( total counts from the star to total noise ) @xmath54 in both filters .",
    "the list was further culled using sharpness ( @xmath26 ) and crowding ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the sharpness cut was chosen based on the distribution of values in the original catalog .",
    "the crowding parameter gives the difference between the magnitude of a star measured before and after subtracting the neighboring stars in the image .",
    "when this value is large , it suggests that the star s photometry was significantly affected by crowding , and we therefore exclude it from our catalog .",
    "quality cuts based on the @xmath28 values were also considered , but they were rejected when a correlation was found between @xmath28 and the local background .",
    "our final star catalogs contained 40793 , 22332 , and 33365 stars for the deep , ne , and sw fields , respectively .",
    "the archival outer disk fields s2 and s3 are much more sparsely populated .",
    "we obtained reliable photometry for only 468 and 692 stars for s2 and s3 , respectively .",
    "the final cmds for the fields are shown in figures  [ cmds ] and [ outer_cmds ] .",
    "we measured the star formation rate and metallicity as a function of stellar age using the software package match @xcite .",
    "we fit the observed cmds ( with magnitude cuts set to limits provided in table  [ table ] ) by populating the stellar evolution models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* with updates in @xcite ) with a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) for a grid of assumed distance and foreground extinction values to allow for systematic differences in stellar evolution models and/or systematic photometric errors .",
    "the choices of software and models used for the angst project are discussed in detail in @xcite and summarized in @xcite .",
    "the best fits provide the combination of ages and metallicities that are contained in the observed field .",
    "we attempted to fit the data with a spread in the model photometry along the reddening line to account for the effects of differential reddening .",
    "however , applying a spread in reddening of @xmath29 to the models degraded the quality of the cmd fits , showing that differential reddening does not significantly affect our measurements in ngc  404 .",
    "the data from the deep field were best fit by a single foreground reddening @xmath12=0.1@xmath300.06 and @xmath31=27.48@xmath300.09 ( see figure  [ residuals ] ) .",
    "this distance modulus is consistent with , but larger than , the value measured by the angst survey ( @xmath31=27.42@xmath300.02 * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit values compensate for any systematic differences between the data and overall model isochrones , whereas the survey value isolated the well - determined location of the tip of the red giant branch in order to measure the best distance .",
    "since these distance and extinction values provided the best overall fit of the models to the data , we performed our fits to the data of every region assuming these values .",
    "our uncertainties in star formation rate account for changes in the sfh measured if the assumed value for the distance modulus was @xmath300.15 mag away from the chosen value and if the extinction value was @xmath300.1 mag away from the chosen value .",
    "we note that in figure  [ outer_cmds ] the apparent magnitude of the tip of the rgb appears fainter than in our more populous cmds .",
    "our fits to these cmds ( figure  [ s3_fit ] ) were not significantly improved by allowing a greater distance modulus , indicating that the small numbers of stars in these fields cause the tip of the rgb to be under - populated . on the other hand , the sfhs of these fields could be significantly different than the inner fields .",
    "the shallow depth and low numbers of stars in these fields limits our ability to constrain the age .",
    "our fits show only that 99% of the stars are older than 1.6 gyr .",
    "thus , it is possible that most of these stars are only a few gyr old , which could produce a fainter trgb .",
    "unfortunately , there is not enough data to constrain whether the cause is undersampling or age .",
    "the cmd can be fitted equivalently well by either possibility .",
    "systematic errors are determined by the match package by comparing the results of sfhs from fits to the data with different values for the distance and foreground reddening to the field .",
    "these errors are then added in quadrature to the random errors governed by our sampling of the cmd .",
    "the random errors are determined by randomly drawing from the observed cmd to produce hess diagrams that vary due to the poisson statistics of our photometric sample . by producing and fitting 100 of these monte carlo cmds",
    ", we are able to determine the rms of the residuals between sfhs from these fits and those from the fits to the original data",
    ". the combined 1@xmath32 error measurements therefore account for the uncertainties in the distance to the galaxy , the foreground reddening , any systematic shifts between the model colors and magnitudes and our measured photometry , as well as the number of stars and features present in our cmd .",
    "our monte carlo tests are also used to determine our time sensitivity ( i.e. , the dependence of our sfh on our choice of time binning ; see * ? ? ? * for a full description of the technique ) .",
    "briefly , we calculate the standard deviation of the maximum likelihood value from our 100 runs .",
    "we assume that any fit to the data more than one standard deviation away from the best fit is unacceptable .",
    "we then rerun our fits while suppressing star formation in various time bins . if the fit quality does not change significantly ( by more than one standard deviation ) , we continue to expand the length of these removed time bins until the software can no longer find an acceptable fit . at this time resolution , we can be confident that our data provide meaningful constraints on the sfh .",
    "the final time bins are all sensitive enough that their removal from the sfh results in an unacceptable cmd fit .",
    "photometric depth determines the precision with which we can recover the sfh of a region .",
    "the effects of age and metallicity are more difficult to distinguish with shallow photometry than with deep photometry .",
    "our deepest photometry comes from our deep field and reaches the red clump in the least crowded region .",
    "this photometry therefore provides the most leverage for breaking the degeneracy between the age and metallicity of the old populations .",
    "in contrast , the data from our 2 shallow fields provide the least of this leverage .",
    "however , since the stellar populations should be well mixed at ages @xmath331 gyr , we used the metallicity distribution for the old stars ( @xmath52  gyr ) as determined from the fit to our full deep field to limit the range of allowed metallicities at each age in the fits to the shallower data . when the free parameters used to fit the shallower data were limited , we found the resulting age distribution of the ancient populations of the shallower fields to be consistent with those of the deep data , and the quality of the fit remained in the acceptable range ( within 1 standard deviation of the value obtained when the full grid of free parameters was allowed ) . in what follows ,",
    "the full - field sfhs for the shallower fields are the best fits possible with the restriction that the ancient population ( @xmath52  gyr ) contain only the metallicities at each age that contributed to the best fit of the deep full - field data .",
    "in addition to the full field cmds , we divided our inner disk fields into 4 annuli to look for radial trends of the stellar populations and to help minimize differential crowding effects across each field .",
    "the annuli were chosen so that each region contained @xmath610000 stars in our deep field data .",
    "their parameters of the annuli are provided in table  [ table ] .",
    "figure  [ annuli_cmds ] shows the cmds of the different annuli in our deep field .",
    "these cmds show clearly that crowding in the inner regions is significantly worse than in the outer regions of our fields ( as shown by the limited depth of photometry in the inner fields ) . in order to constrain the old populations of the 2 inner annuli , we limited the number of free parameters by allowing only the metallicities that provided the best fit to the outermost annulus of the deep field for ages",
    "@xmath52  gyr .",
    "this restriction produced a acceptable fits to the cmds while forcing the ancient population of the innermost regions to be of similar metallicity to that of the outermost region .",
    "@xcite performed an early bulge - disk decomposition on ngc  404 from digitized photographic plate observations in the @xmath23-band , finding a bulge effective radius of 63.8@xmath34 and a disk scale length of 129.5@xmath34 .",
    "their parameters indicate that the disk population is responsible for 50% of the galaxy light at @xmath6165@xmath34 ( near the inner boundary of our third annulus from the center ) . adopting this decomposition ,",
    "our data are centered around the transition region between the domination of the bulge component and the domination of the disk component , suggesting our 2 outer annuli probe regions that are dominated by the disk population .",
    "however , more recently , the light profile of the bulge was measured with _ hst _ data , and the resulting effective radius was found to be smaller ( 38@xmath34 , * ? ? ?",
    "we performed our own fit to the light profile using the _ spitzer _ 3.6@xmath35 m image from the local volume legacy ( lvl ) survey for the central portions and normalizing to the star counts from our _ hst _ data .",
    "we found a similar effective radius ( 42@xmath34 ) .",
    "our fit requires that 75% of the stars belong to the disk at 165@xmath34 .",
    "these measurements suggest that the amount of spheroid contamination inferred from the @xcite decomposition is an upper - limit , and all of our data are dominated by disk stars .",
    "the sfhs for our 3 fields are shown in figure  [ sfh_full ] ( sfr versus time ) and figure  [ cum_full ] ( the cumulative fractional star formation versus time ) .",
    "the sfh of the outer disk ( archival fields s2 and s3 ) was not well - constrained due to the small number of stars .",
    "we note only that the weak constraints obtained from these fields ( @xmath598% of the stellar mass formed before 1.6  gyr ago ) were consistent with the age distributions of the stars in the outer disk being the same as those in our 3 inner disk fields .",
    "the stellar populations are clearly dominated by stars formed prior to 10  gyr ago in all 3 fields .",
    "the cumulative age distribution of all of the fields is consistent with @xmath3670% of the stellar mass formed by @xmath37 .",
    "most of this constraint comes from the deep data , which provided the metallicity constraints for the shallower fields and has the greatest fraction of stellar mass formed prior to 10  gyr .",
    "this initial star formation was then followed by roughly continuous star formation at low levels to very recent times ( @xmath3810  myr ago ) .",
    "galex ultraviolet imaging is consistent with this low level of star formation continuing through the past few myr and possibly to the present day .",
    "the low recent star formation rate is consistent with the low surface density of h i ( @xmath61.2 m@xmath20  pc@xmath21 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our results show that the stars in our disk fields are older than any other disks previously - studied in this manner ; however , it is not clear if all parts of our fields are uniformly old . to address this question , we measured the sfh of our radial annuli .",
    "the cumulative sfhs of the stars in each of the 4 annuli are shown in figures  [ cum_ann_deep ] and [ cum_ann_all ] .",
    "these sfhs do not generally constrain the older populations as well as the full - field fits because the cmds contain fewer stars . however , they are all consistent with @xmath3670% of the stellar mass being formed by @xmath37 .",
    "the deepest photometry in our sample , which comes from the outermost annulus of the deep field , constrains @xmath3690% of the stellar mass to be older than 8  gyr ( @xmath391 ) .",
    "the result from the outermost annulus of the shallower ne field is consistent with that result but does not provide nearly as tight of a constraint ( @xmath570% of the stellar mass older than 2 gyr ) due to the lack of any of the red clump feature in the cmd . in the end ,",
    "the sfhs of our different annuli allow the possibility that the inner annuli are a few gyr younger on average than the outer annuli ; however , it is not clear whether this difference is due to bulge contamination , shallower photometry , or true differences in age .    because the full sfh measurements in our radial annuli did not show any conclusive differences between the stellar populations of the ngc  404 disk with radius , we attempted a more traditional method of comparing the agb / rgb ratios in different regions .",
    "@xcite found that inside of @xmath40150@xmath34 , the ratio of agb to rgb stars decreases with radius , which interpret as evidence for most of the agb population being associated with the bulge .",
    "our constraints on the detailed age distribution in the inner annuli allow the possibility that the inner regions are younger than the outer regions .",
    "furthermore , our innermost annulus has a slightly bluer rgb and a higher agb / rgb ratio than the other annuli studied , consistent with the @xcite results .",
    "gaussian fits to a slice through the cmds in figure  [ annuli_cmds ] at @xmath41 give a central rgb color of @xmath42 = 0.95@xmath300.01 in our innermost annulus , while those of the outer annuli and outer disk fields are all @xmath430.98 .",
    "the ratio of agb stars ( @xmath44 ) to rgb stars ( @xmath45 ) is 0.056@xmath300.005 in the innermost annulus , while those of the outer annuli are all @xmath20.05 .",
    "this ratio was not reliably constrained in the outer disk fields ( s2 and s3 ) , due to the low numbers of stars .",
    "overall , the results of our full cmd fitting , as well as direct measurements of our cmds features , are consistent with the suggestion in @xcite that ngc  404 contains a bulge population that is on average _ younger _ than the disk . however , with the current data we can not distinguish between this possibility and the possibility of radial variations in the mean age of the disk itself .    the metallicity history from our deep field is shown in figure  [ z_full ] .",
    "as with many other nearby galaxies , we find that ngc  404 enriched to [ m / h]@xmath36 - 1 quickly and then appears to have undergone more modest subsequent chemical enrichment .",
    "the errors are very large on the metallicity of the young populations both because the number of young stars is low and because the properties of the upper main sequence is not strongly affected by metallicity .",
    "therefore , while our metallicity history does not show any obvious discontinuities , if recently accreted gas was of different metallicity than the previously - existing gas disk , it is not clear we would have detected the difference with statistical significance .",
    "indeed , the allowed metallicity range in the 30300 myr timebin allows any metallicity [ m / h]@xmath43 - 1.7 .    from these results",
    "we can assign the typical age and metallicity of the stars in these portions of ngc  404 as 12@xmath302  gyr and -0.75@xmath300.37 .",
    "these values are consistent with those determined from fits to optical spectra of the bulge ( @xmath550% of the stars @xmath55 gyr old and  @xmath46}\\sim$]-0.4 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating overall similarity between the bulge and disk populations in ngc  404 , partially explaining the lack of radial trends in our sfhs .    the typical age and metallicity of the stars in ngc  404 can be compared to those of other nearby galaxies , as was done in @xcite .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ galaxies ] .",
    "it shows the ngc  404 disk fields have the oldest typical age of any disk fields in the nearby sample ; however , the age was determined closer to the galaxy center than for any of the other galaxies .",
    "note that the 2 oldest populations , those of the galactic thick disk and ngc  404 , are those measured closest to the galaxy centers .",
    "although the star formation in ngc  404 over the past gyr amounts to an insignificant fraction of the stellar mass of the disk , it is of interest for understanding any radial trends in star formation activity as well as the origin of gas in the ngc  404 disk and its likely fate .",
    "we show the most recent gyr of the sfhs of the full fields in figure  [ recent_full ] , along with the weighted average of all star formation in all fields .",
    "we show these results at a higher time resolution ( @xmath6200  myr ) , since our time resolution is good at these ages due to the rapidly - evolving bright main- and blue he burning sequences , which contain information for ages @xmath38500 myr . for the outer disk fields , we were not able to reliably determine ages from 4001000  myr , due to the small numbers of stars in these fields .",
    "we therefore limited the age range to just two time bins for those fields .",
    "there do not appear to be any radial trends nor any strong positional dependencies of the recent sfh in the our ngc  404 disk fields ( see discussion below ) .",
    "however , a distinct pattern emerges in the global sfhs of the full fields as well as all of the annuli beyond the innermost ( and shallowest ) one .",
    "the pattern is plotted in figures  [ recent_full ] and  [ recent_ann ] , which show all of the recent sfhs in color and their mean in black .",
    "the best fits to all fields suggest that star formation increased substantially @xmath6500 myr ago , rising from consistent with zero to @xmath62@xmath1810@xmath47 m@xmath20 yr@xmath16 kpc@xmath21 by @xmath6400  myr ago , but then falling to a lower level by the present . indeed , no star formation is required during the interval 1.30.3  gyr ago to produce statistically - acceptable fits to the cmd of the deep field",
    "; likewise no star formation is required during the interval 20.3  gyr ago to fit the ne field and during the interval 1.30.2  gyr ago to fit the sw field .",
    "likewise , no star formation more recent than @xmath6100  myr is required to fit the cmds of any of the fields either , showing that any very recent ( @xmath2100  myr ) star formation has been at a very low level , consistent with the lack of any diffuse h@xmath48 emission ( figure  [ ms_stars ] ) .",
    "thus all of our measurements ( outside of the innermost annulus ) _ require _ star formation in the past few hundred myr . while our data allow the possibility that this star formation was confined to the past 300  myr , the best fits to our data have this star formation confined mainly to a small event that occurred @xmath6600200  myr ago .",
    "the recent sfhs from the outer disk data ( archival fields s2 and s3 , figure  [ outer_sfh ] ) are consistent with those obtained from the inner disk after scaling by stellar density .",
    "however , we were unable to reliably constrain the age distribution earlier than 400  myr ago due to the shallow depth and small number of stars in these fields , which are located @xmath62.3 scale lengths ( @xmath49=129.5@xmath34 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) farther out in the disk .",
    "the best fits to outer disk fields suggest an increase in star formation beginning at a similar time ( @xmath6400  myr ago ) as seen in the inner disk fields , with an intensity that is a factor of 10 less than in the inner disk fields , consistent with a simple density scaling .    to look for variations in the most recent ( @xmath38160  myr ) star formation with position in our inner disk fields",
    ", we computed the mass of stars formed in all 11 of our defined regions ( 4 annuli each in the deep and ne fields , and 3 annuli in the sw field ) during the past 160 myr according to our measured sfhs .",
    "this age range probes all o- and early b - type stars , and thus provides a good baseline for comparison with the fuv fluxes measured from the galex data .",
    "we plot the median radius of the stars in each of our regions vs. the mass of stars formed in the past 158  myr in figure  [ mass_vs_r ] .",
    "no radial trend is seen , suggesting that overall the recent sfh of the disk has not been a strong function of radius in the inner ( @xmath25  kpc ) disk , and is more consistent with star formation percolating stochastically across the face of the inner disk @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that there is little , if any , change in the young disk stellar populations with galactocentric distance in ngc  404 from 1 to 9 arcminutes , which covers @xmath63.7 scale lengths of the disk and @xmath69 effective radii .",
    "we have further tested our ability to detect the star formation responsible for the flux in the galex fuv image , which appears as discrete knots of star formation in the ngc  404 disk ( see figure  [ field_loc ] ) .",
    "we first measured the fuv luminosity of these knots in each of our defined regions ( see figure  [ field_loc ] ) using sextractor @xcite .",
    "we then subtracted the expected foreground / background luminosity as determined from a control region 10 scale lengths from the galaxy center .",
    "we find that the fuv luminosity does not correlate with galactocentric distance ( see figure  [ fuv_gcd ] ) , which is consistent with our result that the amount of recent ( @xmath38160  myr ) star formation does not correlate with galactocentric distance ( other than simply scaling with density ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a hint of a correlation between the fuv luminosity of the knots and the mass of stars formed in the past 160 myr , shown in figure  [ mass_galex ] .",
    "a spearman rank test reveals that a correlation is present at only the 2@xmath32 level ( 5% probability of no correlation ) .",
    "the fact that the correlation is weak may seem surprising , but the reason for the weakness is apparent when one looks at the mean age of the stars younger than 160  myr in each region .",
    "the colors of the error bars in figure  [ mass_galex ] indicate this mean age , with redder colors representing older ages . with this additional information ,",
    "it is clear that the most fuv - luminous regions contain the youngest stars , but not the highest stellar masses . at a given age ( similar color points )",
    ", the fuv luminosity correlates better with the stellar mass of young stars .",
    "such a scatter in age should be refected in the fuv - nuv colors of the regions .",
    "we measured these colors and found @xmath300.8 mag rms scatter .",
    "about 0.3 mag of scatter is expected from photometric errors as determined by photon statistics .",
    "some of the additional scatter is due to the presence of foreground stars in the nuv .",
    "varying extinction is not severe enough to explain any additional scatter . in the galex bandpasses , @xmath50=8.376 and @xmath51=8.741 @xcite , or @xmath52=-0.365 .",
    "thus , the scatter in @xmath53 needed to explain the measured scatter in fuv - nuv is @xmath302.2 mag .",
    "such a large amount of differential extinction would be far more than we observe in our cmds . while we can not easily quantify the effects of foreground contamination",
    ", the scatter in fuv - nuv color supports the idea that a range of ages is in large part responsible for the weakness of the correlation .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of upper - main sequence stars on the galex fuv image , shown in figure  [ ms_stars ] , suggests that these young stars are more widely distributed than the fuv emission . while all fuv - bright regions contain upper - main sequence stars , not all upper - main sequence stars are confined within fuv - bright regions .",
    "the different distributions could be explained by stars migrating away from their birth regions on timescales @xmath2160  myr ( consistent with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and fuv emission being dominated by stars younger than 100  myr ( consistent with * ? ? ?",
    "these results show that there is a complex relationship between uv properties , age , and stellar mass in regions containing recent star formation .",
    "it is interesting that our sfhs show an increase in star formation @xmath60.5 myr ago , in light of the suggestion of @xcite that the gas disk may have originated in a merger event with a dirr galaxy 0.51 gyr ago .",
    "however , our full - field cmds all require some star formation between 2 and 10 gyr , as well as star formation between 0.5 and 0.1 gyr ago , to produce an acceptable fit to the observed cmd .",
    "failure to include stars in the 210 gyr age range produces a model cmd containing more blue agb stars above the rgb tip than are seen in the data .",
    "these stars produce a quantitatively significant decrease in the quality of the model fit .",
    "the lower limits on the star formation rates in the 210 gyr period are comparable to the peak rates over the past 500  myr .",
    "to investigate the origin of the gas in the disk , we studied the correlation between gas density and star formation in the disk of ngc  404 over its history .",
    "we assume that all of the stars that formed during a given time interval in our sfh must have been in the form of gas at the beginning of that time interval .",
    "when this gas is added to the gas seen at the present day , we can infer the gas density in the past , and then compare it to the subsequent star formation rate in our sfh .",
    "we can do this at increasing lookback times , giving us a way of probing the correlation between gas density and star formation rate at a range of epochs .",
    "we begin with the current h i column density of the disk from 25@xmath25 ( @xmath61.5@xmath1810@xmath19  cm@xmath21 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which corresponds to 1.2  m@xmath20  pc@xmath21 .",
    "we then assume that @xmath55 and adopt the conversion @xmath56 @xcite to account for metals and molecular gas .",
    "finally , we assume that all stars formed from a previously - existing gas disk that was in place at the beginning of each time interval .",
    "our method therefore requires that the gas disk had a higher surface density in the past in order to provide the material for all of the star formation that subsequently occurred .",
    "we further assume that stellar evolution quickly recycles 20% of the mass of stellar mass back to the gas phase .",
    "this fraction corresponds to all stars @xmath58  m@xmath20 ( assuming a kroupa imf integrated from 0.1 m@xmath20 to 100 m@xmath20 ) , which return their mass to the ism on timescales shorter than 100 myr .",
    "the exact value of this fraction had minimal impact on our estimates .    with the above assumptions , we were able to infer the gas density of the disk for several epochs in the history of ngc  404 and compare that density to our measured star formation rates .",
    "we were then able to test the plausibility of the assumptions by comparing the results to the known correlation between gas density and star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the results of this reconstruction of the history of the gas density and star formation rate in the ngc  404 inner disk are shown in figure  [ schmidt ] , where diamonds show the gas density and mean star formation rates of the disk for each of 5 epochs ( 0.3 , 0.6 , 0.9 , 5 , 12 gyr ago ) calculated from our measured sfhs .",
    "the @xmath57 vs. @xmath58 in the early epochs agrees with the overall trends measured by the h i nearby galaxy survey ( things ) @xcite under the assumption that all of the stars formed from a gas disk that was formed @xmath614  gyr ago .",
    "however , at 0.9 gyr , the star formation rate is inconsistent with the gas density under this `` closed box '' assumption .    to test the possibility that a recent merger with a small gas - rich galaxy may have affected the evolution of the ngc  404 disk , we performed a reconstruction of the past gas density and star formation rate described above , but we altered the closed - box assumption . instead",
    ", we assume that 10@xmath59  m@xmath20 of gas was added to the system 0.60.9 gyr ago .",
    "the effect of this assumption is to make the gas density of the disk significantly lower @xmath61 gyr ago than it is today , unlike the closed box assumption where the gas density strictly increases with lookback time .",
    "the triangle points with dotted errors in figure  [ schmidt ] show the results of this reconstruction .",
    "these points , including the one at 0.9 gyr , are all consistent with the known correlation between gas density and star formation rate .",
    "this consistency allows the possibility that gas was recently accreted , as was suggested by @xcite based on the warped nature of the outer gas disk .",
    "together , these results favor a scenario where a gas disk was in place for many gyr .",
    "this disk was of low surface density ( @xmath25  m@xmath20  pc@xmath21 ) for most of the history of the disk and formed stars at a low rate ( @xmath210@xmath60  m@xmath20  yr@xmath61kpc@xmath21 ) .",
    "this gas may have been completely depleted by @xmath61 gyr ago , when new gas entered the system , either from surrounding gas filaments , or from a small , gas - rich , dwarf galaxy that merged to produce the current gas disk .",
    "this event triggered a small amount of new star formation over the past @xmath6500  myr .",
    "it is still possible that the present gas disk is a relic of the gas that originally formed the disk and that there was no recent merger .",
    "if so , the low - density gas disk must have formed stars in short , weak , episodes that lasted @xmath6200400 myr .",
    "such episodes , like the one we have resolved in the most recent gyr , form only @xmath3810@xmath62 m@xmath20 of stellar mass in the inner disk ( @xmath63  kpc , assuming axisymmetry ) , which could reconcile the amount of stars formed in the past gyr with the amount of gas available in our closed - box assumption . such star formation would be insignificant compared to the @xmath362@xmath1810@xmath64 m@xmath20 of stellar mass formed in the inner disk prior to 10  gyr ago and the 1.5@xmath1810@xmath59 m@xmath20 of h i present @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is favored by the isolated environment of ngc  404 but is not consistent with the star formation rates we measure from 0.61.0 gyr .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest the warped nature of the gas disk as additional evidence for the recent merger . while the warp is consistent with the merger scenario ,",
    "warping can also occur from misalignment of angular momentum during late gas accretion from filaments @xcite and therefore does not require a catastrophic merger .",
    "we have measured resolved stellar photometry for @xmath615 arcmin@xmath65 of the inner disk and @xmath610 arcmin@xmath65 of the outer disk of the s0 galaxy ngc  404 .",
    "detailed fitting of the resulting cmds shows that the disk is dominated by stars older than @xmath610  gyr , with all of our inner disk data constraining the age of @xmath690% of the stellar mass to @xmath58  gyr and our best data constraining the age of 75% of the stellar mass to @xmath510  gyr .",
    "these results show that the difference between this disk and most later - type disks that have been studied in detail is seen in the old stellar population as well as the young .",
    "we found no trends between the age distributions of the young or old populations and distance from the galaxy center within the observed regions .",
    "however , as seen by @xcite the mean rgb color and agb / rgb ratio of the innermost regions are consistent with a bulge population in ngc  404 that is younger than the disk .    despite its low gas density",
    ", ngc  404 appears to have been forming stars throughout its history on timescales of gyr , even in the inner disk ( @xmath611.5@xmath25 ) .",
    "the sfh and the current density of the gas disk are consistent with ngc  404 having evolved roughly in a closed box over much of its history , starting as a large disk of high surface density and approximately following the schmidt law as its overall star formation rate and gas density decreased .",
    "such long - lived disks have been observed in isolated galaxies before , as in the compact dwarf adbs 113845 + 2008 @xcite , whose gas disk is also of low density .",
    "perhaps these low density disks have very long lifetimes due to very low star formation efficiencies at these densities .",
    "our sfhs indicate that star formation in the low density relic disk may be episodic , going through minor episodes of star formation that last a few hundred myr every gyr or so .",
    "on the other hand , in ngc  404 there is some evidence that this passive evolution was slightly disrupted by an event 0.6 - 0.9 gyr ago , possibly a small merger .",
    "such a merger event would alleviate the necessity for very low star formation efficiency @xmath61  gyr ago by allowing that the currently - observed gas disk was not fully in place at that time .",
