    "the discovery a quark  gluon plasma will to some extent be linked to the measurement of the geometric size and other macroscopic characteristics of the reaction zone .",
    "an important tool in accomplishing this is interferometry . as proposed by hanbury - brown and twiss to measure stellar sizes , and as the gglp effect in ( low energy ) nuclear physics , it provides for a straightforward determination of the size of the `` hot source . '' in high  energy collisions , on the other hand , the correspondence between measured quantities and parameters of the emitting system is less clear [ [ welke : review ] ] .",
    "for example , correlations on the same scale as the size of the emitting system make an interferometric study of the correlations inside the matter and a measurement of the external geometry exceedingly difficult [ [ welke : mak72 ] ] .    for a  a collisions , even in the simplest scenario of hydrodynamic evolution , the relation between the inclusive one and two  particle spectra and the parameters of the emitting system does not follow the classical scheme of interferometry [ [ welke : scott ] ] .",
    "since no direct inverse solution exists , and the question of _ what _ is measured by the two  pion correlation function becomes nontrivial .",
    "the problem for interferometry is thus to determine the parameters of a judiciously chosen density matrix @xmath0 for the system , by measuring the inclusive cross - sections @xmath1 , @xmath2  . here",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to particle sources that may be described in terms of ( semi ) classical one  particle distributions , or even by only a few macroscopic parameters .",
    "practically , current dynamical models produce precisely such sources",
    ". however , even with these restrictions , the two  particle spectra are not easily decoded .",
    "we therefore suggest in sect  [ welke_sec:1hydro ] an illustrative `` step - by - step '' strategy : essentially , the data are first confronted with the simplest physically motivated model , and discrepancies are then used show directions for improvement .",
    "ideally , this requires that the model should have an `` adequate '' ( semi ) analytical solution for the correlator , allowing one to obtain the model parameters precisely and directly , without resorting to intermediate fits to the data .",
    "recent sps experiments [ [ welke : na35],[welke : na44 ] ] have observed @xmath3 scaling of longitudinal radii , as well as the @xmath4dependence of the correlator width predicted by boost - invariant 1d hydrodynamic expansion [ [ welke : ms ] ] .",
    "this provides a strong reason for taking macroscopic collective behavior ( _ i.e. _ , hydrodynamics ) seriously and using interferometry to study it  at least at sps energies . here",
    ", we shall therefore extend the calculation of ref .",
    "[ [ welke : ms ] ] to give the ( analytic ) solution in the case of unequal transverse momenta , and illustrate why the data support a relatively rapid freeze  out picture for both pions and kaons .",
    "we also discuss natural extensions of the model to one that might be more appropriate at the ags : ( 1 ) 1d landau hydrodynamics , and ( 2 ) some exactly calculable examples with two and three  dimensional flow . in these cases ,",
    "the scaling law is altered , and we argue generally that such qualitative trends , together with other observables , are important in establishing an adequate model of of the source , and only then the value of its parameters .    before turning our attention to these matters , however , we discuss a related issue : there is no full consensus on what mathematical formulation is adequate for applications of interferometry . for example , an analysis of polarization effects in photon interference [ [ welke : phot ] ] indicates that the languages of locally defined states and wigner phase - space distributions lead to different answers ; there is a practical need to resolve such controversies",

    "[ welke_sec : sn2 ] by briefly formulating the problem of interferometry for an expanding source at the _ operator _ level .",
    "this emphasizes the quantum nature of the problem , and allows us to solve ( correctly ) the basic problem of one and two  particle propagation without having to address the unknown nature of the source . with these expressions in hand ,",
    "we discuss three examples of source input .",

    "this field is detected later by an analyzer , tuned to the measurement of the momentum of the free pion ; its eigenfunctions are thus plane waves @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and the corresponding annihilation operators @xmath10 for momentum @xmath11 in the final state are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 describes the effect of a detector far from the point of emission , so , by definition , the pion is detected on - mass - shell .",
    "the inclusive amplitudes to find one pion with momentum @xmath11 , or two with momenta @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the final state are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the evolution operator after freeze  out , and the @xmath20 form a complete set of all possible secondaries .",
    "one obtains the one and two  particle inclusive spectra by summing the squared modulus of these amplitudes over all ( undetected ) states @xmath20 , and averaging over the initial ensemble @xmath0 .",
    "an analyzer tuned to @xmath11 for singles , or @xmath15 , @xmath21 for pairs , is represented by the operators @xmath22 respectively . in the simplest description , the pion field @xmath6 reaches the detector after free propagation @xmath23 where the field @xmath24 and the space of states in which the density matrix acts are defined on the freeze  out hypersurface @xmath25 .",
    "the pion fock operator ( [ welke_eq : e2.2 ] ) may now be expressed in terms of the initial fields , and simplified using the explicit form of the free pion propagators : @xmath26 clearly , the analyzers perform an on  shell fourier expansion of the initial data . collecting these results",

    "the average of the product of fock operators ( [ welke_eq : e3.18 ] ) , _ i.e. _ , correlations in the emitting system , depends only on `` internal '' variables which identify the stationary states in the cavities before they are opened . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath43functions serve as the projectors of these states onto the states of free propagation in which the particles are detected , and require additional physical input . first",

    "* 2 . emission from many cavities and hydrodynamics : * to generalize the two  cavity model to the freeze  out of an extended hydrodynamic system , we consider a continuous set of decaying thermal cells , defined on a freeze  out surface @xmath47 and doppler shifted to account for cell motion [ [ welke : ms ] ] . as in the previous example",
    ", the initial quantum states in one cell are assumed to commute with states in a different cell .",
    "this additional information implies the existence of two length scales , and allows us to use a quasi  classical picture . within a cell ,",
    "the system is governed by the short - range dynamics conveniently described in momentum language and if the interactions are switched off , the particles begin to propagate freely with the frozen momentum distribution defined _ within the cell_. to the lowest approximation of the dynamical interactions and in agreement with the freeze - out concept , these particles are on - mass - shell . in terms of an auxiliary `` emission function '' @xmath48 , @xmath49 one obtains for the one and two  particle spectra [ [ welke : ms ] ] : @xmath50~ , \\label{welke_eq : e3.26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the latter equation is explicitly symmetric in @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as in @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it reveals interference of the two amplitudes for the two  pion state ( consisting of the two on - mass - shell pions with quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath16 ) to be emitted by the two sources .",
    "these sources are located at points @xmath51 and @xmath52 and have true thermal distributions , @xmath56 , with on - shell particles .",

    "we thus face the problem of understanding the origin of a thermal distribution of off  shell pions , instantly frozen , and detected later in physical on  shell states .",
    "the variables of integration do not correctly establish the correspondence between initial and final states .",
    "moreover , the replacement @xmath81 undermines the concept of independent emission of the two sources  a necessary condition for interference .",
    "each source `` knows '' about the momenta of both pions , and one may reasonably suspect that emission from spatially separated volumes is not independent .",
    "* 1 . one  dimensional flow : * we revisit interferometry for scale invariant 1-d hydrodynamic motion ; evidence for such sources at sps [ [ welke : na35],[welke : na44 ] ] comes from agreement with the theoretically predicted [ [ welke : ms ] ] @xmath82 and @xmath4dependence of the `` visible longitudinal size : '' @xmath83 where @xmath4 is the pair mid - rapidity , and @xmath84 .",
    "physically , the correlator measures the effective size of the fluid slice which forms the observable spectrum at a given rapidity . the larger the transverse momentum of a particle in the fluid , the more that particle is frozen into collective longitudinal motion : the subset of particles with high @xmath85 will have a very narrow distribution over @xmath86 .",
    "it has been conjectured [ [ welke : destil ] ] that kaons may escape from the source earlier and over a longer period of time than pions .",
    "such a `` dynamical '' decoupling will influence the interferometric data .",

'' clearly , @xmath3scaling is violated for this type of emission .",
    "na44 data [ [ welke : na44 ] ] gives no indication of such scaling violation , suggesting that the kaon fluid remains coupled to the pions right until their common ( sharp ) freeze  out .",
    "a systematic and parallel study of pion and kaon interferometric source sizes as a function of @xmath3 will provide a sensitive test for the temporal interval of freeze - out in hadronic matter at rhic .",
    "the dependence ( [ welke_eq : e1 ] ) may well apply at the sps energies , since most of the matter will cool and reach the freeze - out stage due to the fast longitudinal expansion rather than the much slower transverse expansion , but at the ags it is well known that transverse flow plays an important role .",

    "the dependence of the spectral density on @xmath128 is noteworthy : the localization of the spectrum due to radial flow is more pronounced for greater @xmath128 .",
    "particles with @xmath129 spend almost all their thermal energy for the longitudinal motion and thus are strongly frozen into collective radial flow .",
    "for this reason we may expect the width of the correlator in the transverse direction to be defined by @xmath128 , rather than @xmath130 .",
    "this simple and well  understood dependence leads us to conclude that @xmath82 scaling of the transverse radius can not be due to hydrodynamic expansion , and it is even doubtful that it is at all possible .    in the case of small differences in radial particle rapidity",

    "if the radial flow takes place against the background of a strong longitudinal expansion , which is likely in a more realistic scenario of the heavy ion collision , the distinctive @xmath128dependence in the data could be only washed out , but not replaced by an @xmath136dependence .    *",

    ", we obtain @xmath143 all comments related to eq .",
    "( [ welke_eq : e5.12 ] ) apply here , too . here , however , all three directions are physically equivalent and the mass of the particle becomes the only parameter that may re - scale the correlation radius .",
    "we have emphasized some important physical aspects of the theory of interferometry , and tried to isolate some controversial points .",
    "strictly speaking , interferometry does not permit the initial data to be given in terms of semi  classical distributions , unless this description is augmented by a clear indication of the length scale that defines the quantum states of the particles .",
    "our conclusion is that the traditional operator approach , based on the precise definition of the particle states , provides a firm footing for the calculation of the two  particle spectra .",
    "recent preliminary results by na35 and na44 seem to confirm the main predictions of interferometry for a scale ",
    "invariant 1d flow scenario .",
    "they provide a multidimensional test of the source , and the fact that so many parameters coincide can hardly be accidental .",
    "thus , we have strong evidence that at sps energies a hydrodynamic regime develops , and that freeze  out takes place during a short interval .",
    "this collective behavior can be expected to occur at rhic energies , and thus it is highly desirable to continue developing the formalism .",
    "we have extended previous calculations [ [ welke : ms ] ] for a longitudinally expanding system to the case of unequal transverse momenta , and have shown that the hbt correlator may carry information about the time of the kaon emission .",
    "we further considered transversally expanding sources , and demonstrated how to change the parameterization of the correlator .",
    "unfortunately , the attractive feature that the spectrum is localized in the boost  invariant solution for 1d flow is absent in 2 and 3dimensional flows , even if the radial motion is very strong .",
    "this happens because the angular dependence of the cartesian velocity components is weak , and practically means that one should perform all integrations exactly . while even moderate radial flow does obscure the true transverse source size ,",
    "the spectrum is not sufficiently localized to allow one to obtain a simple formula for the correlator ( at least in terms of standard variables ) .",
    "numerical calculations are , of course , possible , but then it becomes difficult to `` recognize '' the model .",
    "we emphasize that while hbt for hydrodynamic sources is well understood as a physical phenomenon , choosing an adequate model to fit the data always poses difficulties .",
    "we impose the condition that the model should allow one to recognize it via a qualitative analysis . only then can one hope to understand what parameters are responsible for the behavior of the correlator , and find their values by fitting the data .",
    "practically , this requirement means that we must begin with an analytic expression for a solution of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this guarantees the consistency between the shape of the freeze  out surface and the velocity field .",
    "unfortunately , analytic solutions for the case of three  dimensional expansion are not yet known .",
    "a reasonable analytic approximation will do , but to our knowledge , a suitable expression has not yet been derived .",
    "an approximate formula describing a realistic , expanding system at the freeze  out stage is an important problem for boson interferometry at rhic .",
