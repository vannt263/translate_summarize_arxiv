    "the study of the spin structure of non - magnetic low dimensional systems by means of spin- and angle - resolved photoemission ( sarpes ) has intesified in recent years @xcite .",
    "one of the driving forces has been the discovery of systems with a large rashba - type spin splitting on a variety of three - dimensional @xcite , two - dimensional @xcite and even one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the fact that for topological insulators the topology of the bulk bands is reflected in the spin structure of the surface states @xcite provided a further boost to this type of experiments . also here a variety of sarpes experiments have been performed in order to elucidate the details of the spin structure and the variations from a purely in - plane helical spin system @xcite . in most of these cases",
    "the initial state has been considered as a pure spin state although under the influence of strong spin - orbit interaction the spin is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "recently it has been shown that due to the orbital mixing in the topological surface state of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 also the spin structure of this state consists of mixed spin states @xcite .",
    "also for rashba systems deviations from the pure spin scenario are expected to occur when spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) induced avoided crossing hybridization leads to an opening of energy gaps between rashba - split bands . when bands belonging to the same group representation approach one another , soc opens a hybridization gap , resulting in an avoided crossing of bands that is absent within a nonrelativistic treatment .",
    "close to the gap the bloch eigenstates get mixed and form new eigenstates . since the driving mechanism for the mixing of the states is soc whose operator ( @xmath2 ) contains both a spin - conserving and a spin - flip term @xcite , we would like to understand how the soc - induced hybridization alters the properties of an initially rashba - split 2deg .    to date",
    ", only few experiments have investigated the subtle interplay between the orbital momentum and spin of hybridized states using the direct method of spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "for example a.g .",
    "_ @xcite found that quantum well states ( qws ) in the low - z material aluminum deposited on the high - z substrate w(110 ) acquire large spin splittings through the interaction with spin - polarized interface states because of the avoided crossing hybridization . in ag films grown on si(111 ) and covered with the @xmath3-bi - ag alloy , it has been shown that spin - selective hybridization occurs between spin - degenerate ag quantum well states and strongly rashba - type spin split alloy surface states @xcite . in both studies",
    "the authors observed a hybridization between states with parallel spin direction .",
    "in contrast to this , first - principles calculations and arpes measurements of bi / cu(111 ) @xcite and biag@xmath4 @xcite indicate a hybridization between states with _ anti - parallel _ spin direction .",
    "whether the former ( hybridization between parallel spins ) or the latter ( hybridization of _ anti - parallel _ spins ) scenario is present in a system depends on the orbital symmetry of the involved wave functions .    as a model system",
    "we investigate qws in an ultra - thin pb film grown on the bi reconstructed si(111 ) substrate .",
    "the studied energy - momentum region contains a single and pronounced electron - like band spin - split by the rashba effect which starts to deviate from the parabolic dispersion at larger wave vectors .",
    "the electronic and structural properties of pb qws on si(111 ) have been intensively studied in the past .",
    "the reason for the large interest is because pb on si(111 ) shows a rich variety of phenomena ranging from anomalies in the superconducting transition temperature @xcite , the formation of magic height islands @xcite , extremely long excited - state lifetimes @xcite , structure dependent schottky barriers @xcite , interface dependent effective mass @xcite , and rashba - type spin splitting @xcite .",
    "here we add the new phenomenon of interband spin - orbit coupling between rashba - type spin - split qws of opposite spin directions .    by means of sarpes combined with a vectorial spin analysis",
    "@xcite we identify an interband spin - orbit coupling caused by the spin - flip term of the soc operator .",
    "our findings are well matched by a simple analytical model adapted from ref .",
    "similar behavior is observed experimentally in pb qws grown on cu(111 ) .",
    "the ( s)arpes experiments were performed with the cophee setup at the surface and interface beamline at the swiss light source of the paul - scherrer - institut @xcite .",
    "the energy and angular resolution of the spectrometer in the spin - integrated ( spin - resolved ) arpes measurements were set to 30 ( 80 ) mev and 0.5@xmath5 ( 1.5@xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "all valence band photoemission data were recorded at a photon energy of 24 ev due to the optimal photoemission cross - section @xcite , with p  polarized light . the base pressure of the chamber was below 2@xmath610@xmath7 mbar and the sample temperature during the measurements was t @xmath8 80 k. the @xmath9-type si(111 ) ( @xmath10  @xmath11 cm ) sample was degassed at 600 k for 24  h and flashed several times above 1300 k to remove adsorbates and to form the ( 7@xmath67 ) surface reconstruction @xcite . the cleanliness of the sample was checked with arpes , where the surface states could be identified , and by inspecting the leed pattern which showed the typical ( 7@xmath67 ) surface reconstruction with intense superstructure spots .",
    "the bi interface with @xmath12r@xmath13 symmetry and 1 monolayer ( ml ) coverage in substrate units ( 1 ml = 7.83 @xmath6 10@xmath14 atoms/@xmath15 ) [ henceforth bi-@xmath3 ] was prepared through the deposition of approximately 3 ml of bi from a water - cooled knudsen cell onto the clean si(111)-(7@xmath67 ) surface at low temperature and subsequent annealing until the @xmath12r30@xmath5 surface reconstruction appeared in leed @xcite . on this reconstructed substrate a thin crystalline pb film was grown by depositing at a rate of @xmath17 ml per minute after cooling down again to below 100 k. under these conditions pb grows in a layer - by - layer mode allowing for a precise determination of the layer thickness through monitoring the binding energies of the subbands as a function of deposition time .",
    "the ultra - thin pb film on cu(111 ) was fabricated by the deposition of pb from a water - cooled e - beam evaporator , at a pressure below @xmath18 mbar , onto a cu(111 ) sample held at 80 k. the single crystal cu(111 ) was cleaned before deposition by several cycles of ar ion bombardment and annealing .",
    "the rashba model was originally proposed to describe the motion of an electron in a 2deg subjected to the electric field due to a broken structural inversion symmetry perpendicular to the plane of confinement , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "in such an environment the electric field acts as a magnetic field in the rest frame of a moving electron with momentum @xmath20 as represented by the rashba hamiltonian , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the so - called rashba parameter which describes the strength of the interaction between the spin @xmath23 of an electron and the effective magnetic field @xmath24 .",
    "the rashba effect is therefore in close analogy to the zeeman effect , except that the quantization axis for the spin , defined by @xmath25 , is a function of both , the momentum of the electron and the electric field .",
    "owing to the rashba effect the initially two - fold degenerate parabolic dispersion splits into two parabolas with oppositely spin - polarized states : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the binding energy at @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 represents the effective mass of the electrons .",
    "the rashba effect has been experimentally confirmed in many systems , such as in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , in shockley - type surface states on noble metals , e.g. au(111 ) @xcite and recently in cu(111 ) @xcite , in surface states of heavy metal surface alloys @xcite , on semiconducting surfaces covered with heavy metals @xcite , and in one monolayer of bi on cu(111 ) @xcite .",
    "many insights into the origin and the strength of spin - orbit interaction have been achieved by studying these systems @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is accepted that the size of the rashba effect in real systems is not a simple function of the electric field at the surface or interface , but that it is more sensitive to the details of the wave function close to the nuclei which in turn are related to structural properties of the surface .",
    "a nice playground for this model is the rashba effect in pb qws @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the in - plane electronic structure of an ultra - thin film formed by 10 monolayers of pb grown on the bi reconstructed si substrate and measured with arpes .",
    "the m - shaped qws with a binding energy ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 = 490 mev at normal emission ( @xmath33@xmath29 ) arises from the quantization of the band dispersion along the @xmath34-@xmath35 direction due to the size reduction which is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",

    "note that the band dispersions are displayed on a relative binding energy scale to illustrate also the differences in the effective mass as a function of interface.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our previous research focussed on the spin texture of the bands in the momentum region around the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) center . here",
    "the system is a good approximation of a quasi - free 2deg confined in a quantum well with a structural inversion asymmetry .",
    "we could show that these states show a rashba effect and that the size of the spin splitting is sensitive to the metal - substrate interface . in the first approach",
    "we have varied the chemistry of the interface by studying various interfactants such as pb , bi and ag , which form highly regular structures of @xmath3 symmetry on si(111 ) .",
    "it is found that the size of the rashba effect changes dramatically between these interfaces : replacing the pb interface by a bi layer reduced the rashba parameter by 60% , whereas qws in pb films grown on a ag reconstructed si substrate showed no measurable spin splitting @xcite , see fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) . the sensitivity of the rashba parameter to the donor concentration of the si substrate revealed a very promising pathway toward the realization of a spintronic device : by increasing the donor concentration by a factor of 20 , we could tune the rashba parameter by a factor of two @xcite , see fig . [",
    "fig1](d ) . a strong sensitivity of the rashba parameter",
    "is also found when changing the type of dopant , while keeping the dopant concentration almost constant ( fig .",

    "it consists of three bands labeled as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which are derived from pb @xmath42 orbitals because the binding energies lie above the pb @xmath43 symmetry band gap in the @xmath34-@xmath35 direction ( cf .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "more specifically , states that are described by an upward parabolic dispersion with band minimum at @xmath44 are mainly of @xmath45 symmetry ( magnetic quantum number @xmath46 ) , whereas states with downward dispersion and band maximum at @xmath44 are of @xmath47 symmetry @xmath48 .        within a momentum range of @xmath49 @xmath29 ,",

    "such a pronounced change in the electronic dispersion has been also observed for monolayers of pb on graphitized sic and explained as due to soc - induced hybridization and is therefore related to the peculiar band structure of the pb film @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1b](b ) we plot the dispersion of the @xmath39-band , which was obtained by fitting energy distribution curves utilizing voigt profiles , as a function of momentum .",

    "we have also included the dispersions of the hole - like @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands , respectively .",
    "the parabolic fit of the @xmath39-band would intersect the @xmath40-band at @xmath56 @xmath57 ( 100 mev , 0.55 @xmath29 ) [ hereafter termed the avoided crossing point ] in case the soc - induced hybridization were turned off .",
    "the fermi level crossing of the @xmath40- and @xmath41-band is also nicely resolved in fig .",

    "an out - of - plane spin polarization ( @xmath70 ) , which has been reported for this system @xcite , is suppressed because we measured along the @xmath44-@xmath71 direction , i.e. in the mirror plane of the @xmath72 sbz .    in the following we switch to the single mott scheme and",
    "focus on the tangential spin polarization component .",
    "this way , we can decrease the @xmath73 steps for similar overall acquisition time and precisely follow the evolution of the spin splitting along the dispersion .",

    "the spin splitting seems to recover again with the same sign of the spin splitting , i.e. @xmath76 , which indicates a sign reversal in the momentum splitting @xmath77 . as will be shown later ,",
    "this sign change is better resolved in spin - resolved momentum distribution curves ( mdc ) rather than sr - edcs . at this point",
    "we notice that in the region beyond the inflection point the tangential spin alignment persists and neither radial nor out - of - plane rotations of the spin polarization vector are observed .",

    "this substantiates our finding that the sign of the momentum splitting of the @xmath39-band reverses upon passing the avoided crossing point . because for this band both the sign of @xmath30 and the sign of @xmath73 changes , the rashba constant maintains its sign since @xmath82 .",
    "however , for the adjacent @xmath40-band we find a sign reversal of the rashba constant .",
    "this is seen from a comparison between the measurements at @xmath83 0.6 ev and @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "scan 7 indicates that the spin - up peak ( indicated by the second up - arrow at @xmath84 0.64 @xmath29 ) is located at lower @xmath62 than the corresponding spin - down peak ( not measured ) .",
    "in contrast , the analysis of scan 1 reveals that the spin - down peak of the @xmath40-band is at lower momentum ( @xmath84 0.53 @xmath29 ) than the corresponding spin - up peak ( @xmath84 0.59 @xmath29 ) .",
    "this means , in between @xmath85 ev and @xmath78 the rashba constant of the band changed its sign as it disperses toward @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , when we compare scan 3 ( at @xmath57 0.25 ev ) with scan 2 ( at @xmath57 0.1 ev ) we can localize this sign change , which is close to the avoided crossing point ( cf .",
    "[ fig1b](b ) ) .",
    "the behavior is therefore different from the one of the @xmath39-band , where both the sign of the effective mass and the sign of the momentum splitting are changed .    to unravel how the spin textures of these bands interplay ,",
    "we have performed a sr - mdc ( single mott ) at the fermi level in an extended momentum range and along the @xmath44-@xmath59 high symmetry direction .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",

    "while the z - polarization reveals a spin configuration of alternating up - down spin pairs , the tangential polarization shows down - up - up - down - up - down excursions .",
    "this means that the rashba constant changes sign between the @xmath40-band and the @xmath41-band .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the out - of - plane rotation of the spin polarization vector increases with the in - plane momentum , which is understood by the fact that states of mainly @xmath86 orbital symmetry are more sensitive to the in - plane gradient of the potential .",
    "this finding is nicely in line with the observations for the high - z metal surface alloys , e.g. bi / ag(111 ) @xcite .",

    "[ fig5](b ) ) it fails to qualitatively reproduce the measured spin splittings as a function of momentum in the hybridization region , i.e. in the momentum region starting at the inflection point . a comparison between both models and the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) . the model of interband so coupling of states with parallel spins predicts neither a decrease of the spin splitting , nor a vanishing spin splitting along the band dispersion .",
    "in contrast , the model of the coupling of states with _ anti - parallel _ spins matches qualitatively the experimental data . that the energy splitting between the @xmath112 and the @xmath113 branch does not decrease linearly with momentum may serve as an indication that the degree of the spin polarization of the new eigenstates ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) , which are formed by mixing of the rashba spinors with opposite spin directions , is no longer 100% , although this has been assumed in the fit .",
    "indeed , theory predicts that toward the avoided crossing point the spin polarization ( p ) of the states @xmath116 and @xmath117 reduces according to @xcite @xmath118 consequently the measured spin polarization of the @xmath39-band toward the crossing point is reduced ( i ) due to the crossing of branches @xmath112 and @xmath113 and ( ii ) because the spin polarization of each branch is reduced due to the mixed spin character .",
    "another indication of the action of the spin - flip term is that both bands @xmath112 and @xmath113 change their spin direction when passing the crossing point . if the spin - conserving term would dominate the spin character would not change when going along these bands @xcite .",
    "whether the action of the spin - flip , or the spin - conserving term of the soc operator is present in a system , depends on the details of the orbital symmetry of the interacting wave functions .",
    "for example , if the @xmath40-band were @xmath92 derived then @xmath119 and @xmath120 , i.e. the spin - conserving part would dominate .",
    "-band in pb / cu(111 ) at @xmath78.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the following we substantiate that the interband so coupling , which explains ( i ) the modification of the dispersion of the @xmath39-band and ( ii ) the sign reversal in the momentum splitting , is independent of the supporting substrate by studying qws in pb / cu(111 ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig7](a ) shows the electronic structure of 8 ml pb on cu(111 ) .",
    "in contrast to the electronic structure of pb / bi / si the effective mass of the @xmath39-band is significantly reduced from @xmath30 = 3.2 @xmath51 to 0.86 @xmath51 , and the pronounced change in the dispersion is situated above the fermi level .",
    "the enhanced dispersion allows to perform a sr - mdc indicated by the dashed arrow in fig . [",
    "fig7](a ) .",
    "the results and our analysis are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) where we show the measured spin - integrated mdc close to @xmath78 ( upper panel ) and the tangential spin polarization data ( lower panel ) , respectively .",
    "we find a sign change in the momentum splitting of the @xmath39-band which is consistent with previous results obtained from pb qws on the bi reconstructed si .",
    "this is further illustrated by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) , which displays the spin alignment at @xmath78 , with the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) .",
    "to summarize , we have identified a momentum region in pb qws where the description of the rashba effect breaks down due to the interband spin - orbit coupling .",
    "essential is that this coupling leads to a hybridization of rashba states with _ anti - parallel _ spins thereby causing the pronounced change in the dispersion of the @xmath39-band , a sign change of the momentum splitting , and in particular a vanishing spin splitting toward the avoided crossing point .",
    "these modifications clearly reflect the soc - induced hybridization mechanism because of the mixed spin and orbital character of the new wave functions .",
    "this finding is consistent with the results obtained from qws in pb on cu(111 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the interband contribution in pb / bi / si is three orders of magnitude stronger then the soi contribution by the rashba effect .",
    "it is expected that this ratio is smaller in pb / pb / si and larger in pb / ag / si due to the different effective masses of the @xmath39-band .",
