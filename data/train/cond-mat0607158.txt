    "amorphous ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 systems are interesting glasses , presenting a high ionic conductivity at room temperature . these materials can be used as model systems for efficient solid electrolytes even though practical applications are more often based on glasses containing lithium or silver ions for example . although the ionic conduction process has been clearly observed in sodium thiogermanate glasses , its microscopic origin is still not clearly understood . like in many other glassy systems , the atomic mechanisms responsible for these transport properties",
    "have not yet been clearly determined which explains the large number of studies dedicated to this topic in the past few years @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is interesting to determine if the modifier ions follow preferential pathways inside the amorphous system @xcite , and if this process is dependent on the glass type . to that end",
    ", theoretical studies such as molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations can provide detailed information concerning the microscopic properties of these chalcogenide glasses .",
    "+ in previous studies we have analyzed the physical and chemical properties of ges@xmath0 glasses via density functionnal theory ( dft)-based molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the results obtained from our model were in very good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "subsequently we studied the vibrational and electronic properties of sodium thiogermanate ( na - ge - s ) glasses using the same description @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the structural properties of ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 amorphous systems using the same dft - based model in order to determine the impact of the na@xmath2 ions on the structure of germanium disulfide glasses .",
    "it should be noted that there is a lack of experimental results in the literature concerning these doped chalcogenide glasses .",
    "thus no extensive comparison with experiments is possible at this time , and our results should be considered as a first step in the study of the structural properties of ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 glasses .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : section ii is dedicated to the description of the theoretical foundations of our model .",
    "subsequently , we present the results obtained in our simulations in section iii . finally , section iv contains the major conclusions of our work .",
    "the mathematical model we have used was developed by sankey and niklewski @xcite .",
    "it is included in a first - principles type molecular - dynamics code , called , that is based on the dft @xcite , within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite . a tight - binding - like linear combination of pseudoatomic orbitals , satisfying the atomic self - consistent hohenberg - kohn - sham equations @xcite , is used to determine the electronic eigenstates of the system .",
    "a basis set of one @xmath3 and three @xmath4 pseudo - orbitals , slightly excited since they vanish outside a cut - off radius of @xmath5 ( 2.645  ) , is required .",
    "+ the pseudopotential approximation is used to replace the core electrons with an effective potential which acts on the valence electrons , and hamman - schluter - chiang pseudopotentials were used in this work @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is calculated through the use of the harris functional @xcite , which avoids long self - consistent calculations by a zero@xmath6 order approximation of the self - consistent density .",
    "further details on the method can be found in the original paper @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in order to limit surface effects , and only the @xmath7 point is used to sample the brillouin zone .",
    "this model has given excellent results in several different chalcogenide systems over the past few years @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we computationally melted a crystalline @xmath8-ges@xmath0 configuration containing 258 particles at 2000k during 60 ps ( 24000 timesteps ) until we obtained an equilibrated liquid .",
    "subsequently we randomly replaced ges@xmath9 tetrahedral units by na@xmath0s@xmath10 units , in order to obtain a given concentration of modifier without affecting the global electrical neutrality of the system .",
    "this procedure has been used in a similar manner in sio@xmath0 glasses @xcite , and keeps the total number of atoms , n , unchanged ( 258 particles in this work ) .",
    "+ following this scheme , we generated eight ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 samples with different sodium concentrations ( x= 0 , 0.015 , 0.03 , 0.06 , 0.11 , 0.2 , 0.33 and 0.5 ) .",
    "the bounding box was rescaled for each sample so that the density matched its experimental counterpart ( with cell lengths ranging from 19.21   for x=0@xcite to 18.3   for x=0.5@xcite ) . since the experimental densities are not exactly the equilibrium densities of the model , the pressure inside the samples is not exactly equal to zero .",
    "nevertheless it is extremely small ( @xmath11 0.4 gpa ) demonstrating the quality of the model .",
    "the resulting system was subsequently melted at 2000k during 60 ps in order for the system to lose memory of the previous artificial configuration .",
    "when the liquid reached an equilibrium state , the systems were quenched at a quenching rate of 6.8@xmath1210@xmath13  k / s , decreasing the temperature to 300k , passing through the glass transition temperature t@xmath14 .",
    "the samples were then relaxed at 300k over a period of 100 ps . in order to improve the statistics of our results , five samples , starting from independent liquid configurations ,",
    "were generated for each concentration .",
    "the results presented here have been averaged over these five samples .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , we determined that the atomic charges in ges@xmath0 glasses using a lwdin description @xcite are equal to + 0.94 for ge atoms and -0.47 for the s particles .",
    "even though homopolar bonds exist in this glass @xcite , no ge - na bonds were seen in our samples at the concentrations studied here ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore we can study the impact of the sodium ions on the short - range order of germanium disulfide glasses by analysis of the s - na bonds exclusively .",
    "+ among the radial pair correlation functions @xmath16 defined as : @xmath17 for the different ( @xmath8,@xmath18 ) pairs , we can hence concentrate on the @xmath19 function .",
    "it can be seen in fig.1 that the @xmath19 for s - na pairs does not change significantly with the concentration of the sodium modifier .",
    "the first - neighbor peak appears at 2.4   for all concentrations ( @xmath20 ) , which is slightly inferior to experimental data concerning crystalline sodium thiogermanate systems ( 2.71   @xcite ) .",
    "however we tested several glassy samples with the program @xcite in a self - consistent @xmath21 description , using the most accurate basis set available in the code for the description of the atomic orbitals ( double zeta polarized + generalized gradient approximation ) : the results were very similar ( d@xmath22  ) to those obtained with .",
    "+ the different coordination numbers @xmath23 can also be calculated .",
    "they correspond to the average number of @xmath18 neighbors of a given @xmath8 atom within a sphere of radius r@xmath24 , r@xmath24 being the first minimum of the corresponding @xmath16 .",
    "we show in fig.2 the evolution of the coordination number of the sulfur atoms with the three elements present in our system .",
    "it can be seen that the value of @xmath25 decreases with the addition of sodium modifier from 1.95 for x=0 to 1.3 for x=0.5 .",
    "this indicates that the na@xmath2 ions break several inter - tetrahedral connections in order to be connected to the sulfur atoms , which explains the increasing value of @xmath26 ( 2.45 for x=0.5 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 relative to homopolar bonds remains constant without any dependency with the sodium concentration .",
    "finally the average coordination number of the sodium atoms relative to the sulfur atoms , @xmath28 , has been found close to 3.27 for x=0.5 .",
    "in fact , the na@xmath2 particles in the system are connected to 3 or 4 sulfur atoms , which is consistent with the results obtained by foix @xmath29 in cluster simulations of na@xmath0ges@xmath10 glasses using a hartree - fock model . @xcite .",
    "+ we reported in a previous study @xcite that 14.53@xmath30 of the sulfur atoms in glassy ges@xmath0 systems are non - bridging ( i.e. connected to only one ge atom ) .",
    "these bond defects have been found @xcite to create a negatively charged electronic environment around the terminal sulfur .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study the evolution of these non - bridging sulfur particles with the introduction of na@xmath2 cations .",
    "we distinguish here between the terminal sulfur atoms connected to ( a ) zero , ( b ) one , ( c ) two or ( d ) three sodium ions , and represent in fig.3 the evolution of these structural entities in ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 for @xmath31 .",
    "+ one can see that the proportion of terminal sulfur atoms that are not linked to a sodium ion decreases significantly as soon as x is non zero .",
    "this variation is counterbalanced by the increase of the proportion of terminal sulfur atoms connected to one sodium atom , which reaches approximately the same value of @xmath3215@xmath30 of the s particles in the sample .",
    "we can therefore deduce that , as expected , the non - bridging sulfurs present in @xmath33-ges@xmath0 significantly attract the na@xmath2 ions . between @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "these structural entities decrease ( fig.3(b ) ) , and are counterbalanced by the increase of terminal sulfur connected to two na ions ( fig.3(c ) ) , that also reaches the value of @xmath3215 @xmath30 .",
    "finally , for @xmath36 the proportion of terminal sulfurs connected to three sodium ions reaches @xmath3215 @xmath30 as in the aforementioned cases .",
    "this shows that the non - bridging sulfur atoms observed in @xmath33-ges@xmath0 attract @xmath37 na@xmath2 ions in sodium thiogermanate glasses .",
    "+ the study of the short - range charge deviation in @xmath33-ges@xmath0 has also revealed the existence of `` positively '' charged zones , which are mainly caused by 3-fold coordinated sulfur and homopolar bonds  @xcite .",
    "we find that these positively charged zones remain basically unchanged in ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 glasses , and that the na@xmath2 ions never connect to 3-fold coordinated sulfur atoms .",
    "hence negatively and positively charged zones in @xmath33-ges@xmath0 appear to attract and repel the na@xmath2 cations respectively .",
    "this observation , which seems to be self - evident , is in fact relevant since all the different samples have been melted , quenched , and relaxed _",
    "independently_. despite that , we find similarly charged zones in comparable proportions in all of these samples .",
    "+ the decrease of the @xmath25 coordination number with increasing sodium content observed in fig .",
    "2 shows that an increasing number of intertetrahedral bonds are destroyed by the addition of sodium ions .",
    "since two different types of intertetrahedral links exist in glassy ges@xmath0 ( edge - sharing and corner - sharing links ) , it is interesting to determine which type of s - ge connections are destroyed by the introduction of the na@xmath2 ions .",
    "these two types of intertetrahedral connections can be distinguished in the radial pair correlation function of germanium - germanium pairs @xcite , leading to ge - ge distances equal to 2.91   ( edge - sharing ) and 3.41   ( corner - sharing ) . in fig .",
    "4 we present the _ total _ number of corner - sharing and edge - sharing links in the different samples as a function of sodium concentration .",
    "it can clearly be seen that exclusively corner - sharing links are destroyed by the introduction of sodium cations whereas the number of edge - sharing links remains constant for all sodium concentrations .",
    "this result in not predictable _ a priori _ since very different results may be obtained depending on the glass and the modifier .",
    "for example , experimental studies on chalcogenide sis@xmath0 glasses have shown that li@xmath2 cations destroy exclusively edge - sharing links @xcite , while the addition of na@xmath2 ions was found to break corner - sharing and edge - sharing links in equal proportions @xcite . here",
    "we find that sodium ions destroy exclusively corner - sharing links in ges@xmath0 glasses but this result still has to be confirmed ( or refuted ) experimentally .",
    "+ in order to analyze the global impact of the sodium ions on the structure of thiogermanate glasses , we studied next the total static structure factor @xmath38 of our ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 glasses .",
    "the total static structure factor was computed using the following formulae : @xmath39 where @xmath40 } { \\left [ \\displaystyle   \\sum_{\\alpha } c_{\\alpha } b_{\\alpha } \\right]^2 } \\ ] ] in the above equations , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the edge of the box , the @xmath16 are the radial pair correlation functions ( @xmath43 ge , s , na ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the concentrations of the species @xmath8 and @xmath18 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are their scattering lengths taken equal to 8.18 fm for ge , 2.84 fm for s and to 3.63 fm for na @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath38 , calculated using the above definition , are shown in fig.5 for the different values of @xmath48 ( even though these results are directly comparable to neutron scattering experiments , no experimental data is available to our knowledge ) .",
    "+ the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) , which is a signature of amorphous materials , appears at @xmath491 @xmath50 in @xmath33-ges@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this peak reveals the existence of a structural order on a length scale @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath52    in germanium disulfide glasses . in sodium thiogermanate glasses",
    ", it can be seen that the intensity of the fsdp decreases significantly with @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "this decrease of the fsdp has also been observed experimentally in silver thiogermanate glasses @xcite .",
    "this means that the introduction of ions disturbs the intermediate range order of the glassy matrix by breaking corner - sharing intertetrahedral connections .",
    "however for @xmath55 , a new feature appears in the structure factor at a lower value of @xmath56 ( @xmath57  @xmath50 ) . for x=0.5",
    "this pre - peak reaches almost the same intensity than the original fsdp , which almost completely vanishes and shifts to a slightly higher @xmath56 value . in order to find the origin of this new peak we calculated the partial structure factors ( computed from the radial pair correlation functions @xmath16 ) in the different samples , and in particular the na - na partial structure factor ( fig.6 ) .",
    "we find that the sodium - sodium pairs are mainly responsible for the pre - peak observed in fig.5 .",
    "it can indeed be seen that a peak emerges at @xmath57  @xmath50 for @xmath58 and subsequently grows with increasing @xmath48 . to analyze the structural arrangement of the sodium atoms , which are obviously not distributed homogeneously inside the simulation box , we present the density of sodium atoms in a ( 0.33)na@xmath0s-(0.66)ges@xmath0 averaged over the relaxation time in fig.7 . to that end , we divide the bounding box into 1000 ( 10@xmath1210@xmath1210 ) elementary volume elements .",
    "we subsequently calculated the number of na atoms located in each specific volume element , and integrated this quantity over the relaxation time . hence each sphere represented in fig.7",
    "is located at the center of a volume element , and its size increases ( becomes more red in color ) with the local na density ( the largest sphere and thus the highest density corresponds to 0.154 @xmath59 ) .",
    "this figure shows that our sodium thiogermanate sample contains several zones which have a high concentration of na@xmath2 and other zones which have a poor concentration of na@xmath2 ions . when we analyzed the local structure around the sodium atoms we found that most of them are in a na@xmath0s - like environment , since for @xmath48=0.5 , 23.5 @xmath30 of all the sulfur atoms are _ exclusively _ connected to na ions , i.e. without any germanium atom as their nearest - neighbors .",
    "these sodium rich zones could be the static `` remainders '' of conduction channels that could be observed at higher temperatures similarly to what has been reported in sodium enriched silicate glasses via _",
    "classical _ molecular dynamics simulations and inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite . if we accept this hypothesis , then , since the new pre - peak appears only for high sodium concentrations ( see fig.6 ) , conduction channels would be absent at low sodium content and this could explain the experimentally observed increase in the sodium diffusion constant when the sodium concentration is greater than @xmath48=0.10 @xcite",
    ". unfortunately , the dft - based model that we used to perform these simulations are too computationally expensive making it difficult to reach the simulation time required to study the diffusion of the na@xmath2 ions , and to analyze the evolution of these zones from a dynamical point of view .",
    "this is the reason why the sodium rich zones presented in fig.7 can not be directly assimilated to the diffusion channels .",
    "+ most of theses results have no experimental counterparts and therefore need still to be confirmed or invalidated , but neutron diffraction studies on these systems have been performed and the results should be available in a not so distant future . + to pursue this study further it would also be interesting to analyze the influence of the nature of the modifier on the results . thus similar studies on silver thiogermanate glasses are currently in progress .",
    "we have studied the structural properties of sodium thiogermanate glasses via dft - based molecular dynamics simulations for eight different modifier concentrations .",
    "we find that the structure of these chalcogenide glasses is significantly influenced by the extended positively and negatively charged zones observed in amorphous ges@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as expected , the sodium cations are mainly attracted by the negative zones and avoid the positive regions . at high sodium concentrations ,",
    "the na@xmath2 ions therefore become localized in space , and zones containing high and low density of sodium cations can be observed .",
    "these na@xmath0s - rich zones could be the low temperature analogs of the `` conduction channels '' observed in silicate glasses , where the diffusing ions follow preferential pathways .",
    "we have also determined that the addition of sodium cations inside the ( x)na@xmath0s-(1-x)ges@xmath0 system destroys exclusively the corner - sharing links for @xmath60 .",
    "+ the structure factor of the different samples shows that the fsdp that appears in amorphous ges@xmath0 at @xmath491 @xmath50 , decreases significantly with the addition of sodium ions . at high sodium concentrations ( @xmath61 ) , a new pre - peak appears at @xmath62 , which corresponds to a distance in real space of 12.6   .",
    "the na - na partial @xmath38 shows that the na - na pairs are responsible of this pre - peak indicating a non homogeneous distribution of the na@xmath2 ions inside the glass which is consistent with the existence of the aforementioned sodium rich zones .",
