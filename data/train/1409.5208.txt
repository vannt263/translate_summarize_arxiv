    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , geneva , is a 27 km long circular accelerator  @xcite .",
    "it is based on a superconducting two - in - one magnet design , with dipoles that allow it to reach a design energy of 7tev per beam .",
    "it features eight straight sections : four interaction points ( ips ) are reserved for accelerator equipment and four house particle physics experiments . ip3 and ip7 are dedicated to the collimation system , ip4 houses the rf system and most of the beam instrumentation , while ip6 is reserved for the beam dump system .",
    "ip1 and ip5 contain the high - luminosity experiments atlas and cms , while ip2 and ip8 accommodate the alice and lhcb experiments , together with beam injection ( beam 1 through ip2 , clockwise ; beam 2 through ip8 , counterclockwise ) .",
    "the luminosity requirements of the four experiments are very different  @xcite .",
    "two high - luminosity experiments and the discovery of a new boson are the reason for the push towards high - intensity proton physics performance .",
    "this is detailed in the next section , where the beam parameters are compared between the design report and 2012 operation .",
    "alice and lhcb have luminosity limitations , and thus techniques of luminosity levelling have been applied consistently during proton physics production and will be described next .",
    "the different luminosity requirements also impact the construction of the filling schemes .",
    "various collision patterns have been used for physics production and during 2012 a change was required to overcome recurrent loss of landau damping .",
    "the beam parameters were pushed much further during single - bunch machine development ( md ) sessions , achieving very high beam  beam tune shifts .",
    "similar conditions were used for high pile - up studies for the experiments  @xcite .",
    "scans of the crossing angle were done during md sessions to evaluate the effect of long - range interactions in bunch trains , allowing the onset of losses for scaling laws to be measured  @xcite .",
    "the description of these studies and of the observation of orbit effects conclude this paper .",
    "in these first years of luminosity production , the operation of the lhc has exceeded all expectations .",
    "the year 2010 was mostly a commissioning year , and the instantaneous luminosity target was exceeded by a factor of 2 , as @xmath0@xmath1s@xmath2 was achieved .",
    "the years 2011 and 2012 were dedicated to luminosity production in search for new physics , and 5.5 fb@xmath2 and 23.2 fb@xmath2 were collected in each year , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : params ] shows the machine and beam parameters as defined in  @xcite compared to the ones used in 2012 operation . despite the beam energy being about half the design value , the achieved peak luminosity was over 75% of the design value of @xmath3@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath4 at the high luminosity experiments in ip1 and ip5 almost reached design values thanks to the excellent physical aperture and the use of ` tight collimators '  @xcite .",
    ".a comparison of parameters between design values  @xcite and what was achieved in 2012 operation [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : scans ]    .,width=283,height=166 ]        as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : lrlosses ] shows the losses in the case of beam 1 for the first scan in table  [ tab : scans ] , when the crossing angle in ip1 was reduced from 120@xmath5rad , or 100% , to a minimum of 40% ( corresponding to 4@xmath6 beam separation  @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen that the onset of strong losses is between 4 and 5  @xmath6 separation , depending on the number of lr interactions experienced by the bunch ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlr ] ) .",
    "the scans served as evidence for the effectiveness of the alternate crossing scheme , since when scanning ip5 after ip1 , the lifetime seemed best when the separation and the crossing angles were equal for the two ips ( we recall that the crossing plane is vertical in ip1 and horizontal in ip5 , to compensate for first - order lr effects ) . a dependence on the number of head - on collisions was also shown .",
    "a scan was also performed for 25ns spaced beams  that is , with twice the number of lr interactions  as it was expected that a bigger separation will be needed , and the information will be useful in deciding the settings for future operation .",
    "an asymmetry between beams 1 and 2 was observed but is not yet fully understood ( it is possibly related to electron cloud effects ) .",
    "it has been predicted that pacman bunches will have different orbits due to lr collisions , and a fully self - consistent treatment was developed to compute those different orbits  @xcite .",
    "the lhc orbit measurement can not resolve these effects , but the atlas vertex centroid measurement  @xcite was used to qualitatively verify the agreement  @xcite .",
    "the beam dump of a single beam in collisions leads to a transient effect due to missing lr deflections , resulting in a single - turn trajectory perturbation of the other beam .",
    "an end - of - fill test was performed with 72 25ns spaced bunches ( @xmath7p / bunch , @xmath8 half crossing angle  @xcite ) .",
    "the horizontal perturbation of the beam 1 orbit in the arc is @xmath9 mm = @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) .",
    "this leads to beam losses above dump thresholds with the physics beam .",
    "the effect was observed on beam losses throughout 2012 .",
    "the operation and performance of the lhc are strongly influenced by beam ",
    "beam effects , which , already in these first years of physics production , have driven the choice of beam parameters , machine settings , and filling schemes , so to improve performance and mitigate instabilities .",
    "a list of observations from routine operation and dedicated studies has been presented in this paper to give an overview of the extent to which beam  beam related effects have shaped lhc operation for high - intensity proton physics .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge the operation teams of the lhc and its injectors for their observations during beam operation and their help and support during dedicated studies .",
    "the lhc experiments are also acknowledged for providing luminosity and other beam - related data in a productive and collaborative way .",
