    "multiparticle tunnelling ( mpt ) is known to be a mechanism of dissipative current transport in superconducting tunnel junctions at the subgap applied voltage @xmath0 , and at small temperature @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the mpt is completely equivalent to the _ coherent _ multiple andreev reflection mechanism ( mar ) @xcite . here",
    "we use the term mpt to emphasize the low transparency , tunnel junction limit , leaving the term mar for a general case of transparent weak links .",
    "each mpt event can be considered as a chain of multiple andreev reflections @xcite accompanied by the transfer of @xmath2 electrons through the tunnel barrier and eventually results in the creation of two quasiparticles which contribute to the dissipative current .",
    "this process manifests itself in the set of the current steps at @xmath3  the subharmonic gap structure ( sgs )  which is commonly observed in planar junctions with tunnel barriers @xcite , and in tunable mesoscopic constrictions in the tunnelling regime @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts the scaling @xmath4 between the neighboring current steps in the tunnelling sgs , where @xmath5 is the bare transparency of the junction tunnel barrier @xcite .",
    "however , in the experiment , the sgs scaling parameter is generally much larger .",
    "a common explanation for this enhancement is the imperfection of the junction insulating layer @xcite . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite the attention was drawn to an alternative explanation : effect of disorder in planar junction electrodes ; it was predicted that the sgs scaling parameter for planar diffusive junctions is enhanced by a factor @xmath6 , or even @xmath7 depending on the junction geometry ( @xmath8 is the coherence length , @xmath9 is the elastic mean free path , @xmath10 is the thickness of electrodes ) .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed theory of the mpt in planar josephson tunnel junctions with diffusive thin - film electrodes and extensively discuss the details of the behaviour of the mpt currents and the relevant asymptotical methods .",
    "the theory is based on the direct solving of the diffusive equations of nonequilibrium superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with this approach is related to essentially nonstationary character of the josephson tunnel transport .",
    "while analytical and numerical methods are well developed for solving stationary usadel equation @xcite and nonequilibrium keldysh - usadel equation @xcite , the nonstationary problem was so far studied only numerically @xcite . the central model assumption made in this paper and relevant for the tunnel regime concerns discrimination of nonzero harmonics of the green s functions and the distribution function .",
    "this approximation turns the originally difficult problem into an analytically tractable one , and at the same time it captures all qualitative , and to large extent quantitative properties of the tunnelling sgs . within this approximation",
    "we are able to develop a relatively simple and physically appealing calculation scheme , which combines the improved iterative procedure for evaluating the tunnelling density of states ( dos ) , and the circuit theory methods @xcite for evaluating the dc current .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the resulting physical picture of the mpt is as follows : the tunnelling processes create the local nonzero dos inside the bulk energy gap in the vicinity of the tunnel junction .",
    "this allows quasiparticles to overcome the energy gap at a small applied voltage in several steps , by repeated bouncing between the junction electrodes ( mar ) .",
    "the spectral current through the energy gap , which determines the net charge current , is calculated by considering an effective circuit theory network representing the tunnelling process .",
    "the effect of substantial enhancement of the sgs scaling factor can be qualitatively understood from a mesoscopic picture of the diffusive tunnelling transport , namely , tunnelling through a set of independent quasi - ballistic conducting channels with randomly distributed transparencies @xcite . within this picture ,",
    "the contribution of each channel can be evaluated using the ballistic mar theory @xcite . in constrictions with length @xmath11 the transparencies",
    "are spread over the interval @xmath12 @xcite , which implies that the junction transparency , and hence the sgs scaling factor , are effectively enhanced by the factor @xmath13 .",
    "this explanation , however , is valid only for short constrictions , @xmath14 , while it does not apply to planar tunnel junctions with overlapping thin - film electrodes commonly used in experiments and shown in figure [ model ] . in these structures , massive pads ( reservoirs )",
    "are fairly far from the junction ( @xmath15 ) ; in such a situation the effective junction length is defined by the scale of spatial variation of the green s function , i.e. , by the coherence length .",
    "if the size @xmath16 of the overlapping parts of the electrodes is comparable to the electrode thickness @xmath10 , then the junction can be considered as an effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) one ( see figure [ model](a ) ) ; in this case , the sgs enhancement factor becomes @xmath17 .",
    "if the junction cross - section is much larger than the cross - section of the electrodes ( see figure [ model](b ) ) , the current concentrates not at the junction but rather in electrodes @xcite , and an additional enhancement factor @xmath18 appears in the sgs scaling , which coincides with the result of rigorous calculation in this paper .",
    "remarkably , this enhancement concerns only the multiparticle currents , while the single - particle current is not affected and is proportional to the bare transparency @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in its major part",
    "we develop a theory for the 1d junctions , figure [ model](a ) , and discuss the extension to the planar junctions , figure [ model](b ) , towards the end , in section [ secplanar ] .",
    "we start with discussion of basic equations and adopted approximations in section [ sec1d ] .",
    "then we construct the circuit theory in section [ seccircuit ] , and develop a perturbation theory for the dos in section [ secdos ] .",
    "the mpt currents are calculated in sections [ secthresholds ] and [ secpeaks ] ; the latter section includes also the calculation of the excess current .",
    "the effect of neglected harmonics in the keldysh and green s functions is evaluated in section [ secharmonics ] . in section [ diss ]",
    "we discuss the results and possible implications of the theory .",
