    "a long - standing goal of hadron physics has been to understand how the quark and gluonic degrees of freedom that are present in the fundamental qcd lagrangian manifest themselves in the spectrum of hadrons .",
    "of particular interest is how the gluon - gluon interactions might give rise to physical states with gluonic excitations .",
    "one class of such states is the hybrid mesons , which can be naively thought of as quark anti - quark pairs coupled to a valence gluon ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations  @xcite predict a rich spectrum of hybrid mesons .",
    "a subset of these hybrids have an unmistakable experimental signature : angular momentum ( @xmath12 ) , parity ( @xmath13 ) , and charge conjugation ( @xmath14 ) that can not be created from just a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "such states are called exotic hybrid mesons .",
    "the primary goal of the gluex  experiment in hall  d is to search for and study these mesons .",
    "a detailed overview of the motivation for the gluex  experiment as well as the design of the detector and beamline can be found in the initial proposal to the jefferson lab program advisory committee ( pac ) 30  @xcite and a subsequent pac 36 update  @xcite .",
    "while the currently - approved 120 days of beam time with the baseline detector configuration will allow gluex  an unprecedented opportunity to search for exotic hybrid mesons , the existing baseline design is inadequate for studying mesons or baryons with strange quarks .",
    "this proposal focuses on developing additional detector capability that will allow gluex  to identify kaons and operate at high intensity .",
    "this functionality is essential in order for the gluex  experiment to pursue its primary goal of solidifying our experimental understanding of hybrids by identifying _",
    "patterns _ of hybrid mesons , both isoscalar and isovector , exotic and non - exotic , that are embedded in the spectrum of conventional mesons .",
    "our understanding of how gluonic excitations manifest themselves within qcd is maturing thanks to recent results from lattice qcd .",
    "this numerical approach to qcd considers the theory on a finite , discrete grid of points in a manner that would become exact if the lattice spacing were taken to zero and the spatial extent of the calculation , _",
    "i.e. , _ the  box size , \" was made large . in practice ,",
    "rather fine spacings and large boxes are used so that the systematic effect of this approximation should be small .",
    "the main limitation of these calculations at present is the poor scaling of the numerical algorithms with decreasing quark mass - in practice most contemporary calculations use a range of artificially heavy light quarks and attempt to observe a trend as the light quark mass is reduced toward the physical value .",
    "trial calculations at the physical quark mass have begun and regular usage is anticipated within a few years .",
    "the spectrum of eigenstates of qcd can be extracted from correlation functions of the type @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 are composite qcd operators capable of interpolating a meson or baryon state from the vacuum .",
    "the time - evolution of the euclidean correlator indicates the mass spectrum ( @xmath17 ) and information about quark - gluon substructure can be inferred from matrix - elements @xmath18 . in a series of recent papers  @xcite",
    ", the hadron spectrum collaboration has explored the spectrum of mesons and baryons using a large basis of composite qcd interpolating fields , extracting a spectrum of states of determined @xmath19 , including states of high internal excitation .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqcd_meson ] , these calculations , for the first time , show a clear and detailed spectrum of exotic @xmath1 mesons , with a lightest @xmath20 lying a few hundred mev below a @xmath21 and two @xmath22 states . beyond this , through analysis of the matrix elements @xmath18 for a range of different quark - gluon constructions , @xmath23 , we can infer @xcite that although the bulk of the non - exotic @xmath1 spectrum has the expected systematics of a @xmath2 bound state system , some states are only interpolated strongly by operators featuring non - trivial gluonic constructions .",
    "one may interpret these states as non - exotic hybrid mesons , and , by combining them with the spectrum of exotics , it is then possible to isolate a lightest hybrid supermultiplet of @xmath24 and @xmath25 states , roughly 1.3 gev heavier than the @xmath26 meson .",
    "the form of the operator that has strongest overlap onto these states has an @xmath27-wave @xmath2 pair in a color octet configuration and an exotic gluonic field in a color octet with @xmath28 , a _",
    "chromomagnetic _ configuration",
    ". the heavier @xmath29 states , along with some positive parity non - exotic states , appear to correspond to a @xmath13-wave coupling of the @xmath2 pair to the same chromomagnetic gluonic excitation .",
    "a similar calculation for isoscalar states uses both @xmath30 and @xmath31 constructions and is able to extract both the spectrum of states and also their hidden flavor mixing .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lqcd_meson ] . ) the basic experimental pattern of significant mixing in @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels and small mixing elsewhere is reproduced , and , for the first time , we are able to say something about the degree of mixing for exotic-@xmath1 states . in order to probe this mixing experimentally , it is essential to be able to reconstruct decays to both strange and non - strange final state hadrons .        a chromomagnetic gluonic excitation can also play a role in the spectrum of baryons : constructions beyond the simple @xmath34 picture can occur when three quarks are placed in a color octet coupled to the chromomagnetic excitation .",
    "the baryon sector offers no ",
    "smoking gun \" signature for hybrid states , as all @xmath35 can be accessed by three quarks alone , but lattice calculations @xcite indicate that there are  excess \" nucleons with @xmath36 and excess @xmath37 s with @xmath38 that have a hybrid component . an interesting observation that follows from this study",
    "is that there appears to be a common energy cost for the chromomagnetic excitation , regardless of whether it is in a meson or baryon . in fig .",
    "[ fig : baryon_meson ] we show the hybrid meson spectrum alongside the hybrid baryon spectrum with the quark mass contribution subtracted ( approximately , by subtracting the @xmath26 mass from the mesons , and the nucleon mass from the baryons ) .",
    "we see that there appears to be a common scale @xmath39  gev for the gluonic excitation , which does not vary significantly with varying quark mass .",
    "hybrid baryons will be challenging to extract experimentally because they lack ",
    "exotic \" character , and can only manifest themselves by overpopulating the predicted spectrum with respect to a particular model .",
    "the current experimental situation of nucleon and @xmath37  excitations is , however , quite contrary to the findings in the meson sector .",
    "fewer baryon resonances are observed than are expected from models using three symmetric quark degrees of freedom , which does not encourage adding additional gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the current experimental efforts at jefferson lab aim to identify the relevant degrees of freedom which give rise to nucleon excitations .",
    "while lattice calculations have made great progress at predicting the @xmath40  and @xmath37  spectrum , including hybrid baryons  @xcite , calculations are also underway for @xmath10  and @xmath41  resonances .",
    "the properties of these multi - strange states are poorly known ; only the @xmath35 of the @xmath42 have been ( directly ) determined experimentally  @xcite .",
    "previous experiments searching for cascades were limited by low statistics and poor detector acceptance , making the interpretation of available data difficult . an experimental program on cascade physics using the gluex  detector",
    "provides a new window of opportunity in hadron spectroscopy and serves as a complementary approach to the challenging study of broad and overlapping @xmath40  states .",
    "furthermore , multi - strange baryons provide an important missing link between the light - flavor and the heavy - flavor baryons .",
    "just recently many new beautiful baryons , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , have been discovered at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "we discuss @xmath10  baryons further in section  [ sec : xi_baryon ] .",
    "gluex  is ideally positioned to conduct a search for light quark exotics and provide complementary data on the spectrum of light quark mesons .",
    "it is anticipated that between now and the time gluex  begins data taking , many results on the light quark spectrum will have emerged from the besiii experiment , which is currently attempting to collect about @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 decays",
    ". these charmonium states decay primarily through @xmath50 annihilation and subsequent hadronization into light mesons , making them an ideal place to study the spectrum of light mesons .",
    "in fact several new states have already been reported by the besiii collaboration such as the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 in @xmath54 , @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "no quantum number assignment for these states has been made yet , so it is not yet clear where they fit into the meson spectrum .",
    "gluex  can provide independent confirmation of the existence of these states in a completely different production mode , in addition to measuring ( or confirming ) their @xmath1 quantum numbers .",
    "this will be essential for establishing the location of these states in the meson spectrum .",
    "the besiii experiment has the ability to reconstruct virtually any combination of final state hadrons , and , due to the well - known initial state , kinematic fitting can be used to virtually eliminate background .",
    "the list of putative new states and , therefore , the list of channels to explore with gluex , is only expected to grow over the next few years as besiii acquires and analyzes its large samples of charmonium data .    while the glue - rich @xmath50 decays of charmonium have long been hypothesized as the ideal place to look for glueballs , decays of charmonium",
    "have also recently been used to search for exotics .",
    "the cleo - c collaboration studied both @xmath56 and @xmath57 resonances in the decays of @xmath58 and observed a significant signal for an exotic @xmath20 amplitude in the @xmath57 system  @xcite .",
    "the observation is consistent with the @xmath59 previously reported by e852 in the @xmath60 system  @xcite .",
    "however , unlike e852 , the cleo - c analysis was unable to perform a model - independent extraction of the @xmath60 scattering amplitude and phase to validate the resonant nature of the @xmath20 amplitude .",
    "a similar analysis of @xmath61 decays will most likely be performed by besiii ; however , even with an order of magnitude more data , the final @xmath62 sample is expected to be just tens of thousands of events , significantly less than the proposed samples that will be collected with gluex . with the exception of this recent result from cleo - c , the picture in the light quark exotic sector , and",
    "the justification for building gluex , remains largely the same as it did at the time of the original gluex  proposal ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "all exotic candidates reported to date are isovector @xmath20 states ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "with the addition of kaon identification , gluex  is capable of exploring all possible decay modes ( non - strange and strange ) in order to establish not just one exotic state , but a _ pattern _ of hybrid states with both exotic and non - exotic quantum numbers .",
    "the idea that hybrids should also appear as supernumerary states in the spectrum of non - exotic @xmath1 mesons suggests an interesting interpretation of recent data in charmonium .",
    "three independent experiments have observed a state denoted @xmath64  @xcite ; it has @xmath25 quantum numbers but has no clear assignment in the arguably well - understood spectrum of @xmath50 . even though the state is above @xmath65 threshold , it does not decay strongly to @xmath65 as the other @xmath25 @xmath50 states in that region do .",
    "its mass is about 1.2  gev above the ground state @xmath48 , which is similar to the splitting observed in lattice calculations of light mesons and baryons .",
    "if this state is a non - exotic hybrid , an obvious , but very challenging , experimental goal would be to identify the exotic @xmath20 @xmath50 hybrid member of the same multiplet , which should have approximately the same mass , the expectation in charmonium is that a @xmath25 non - exotic hybrid would exist with about the same mass as the @xmath20 exotic charmonium hybrid  @xcite . ] .",
    "it is not clear how to produce such a state with existing experiments . in the light quark sector , some have suggested that the recently discovered @xmath66  @xcite is the strangeonium ( @xmath31 ) analogue of the @xmath64 . if this is true , gluex  is well - positioned to study this state and",
    "search for its exotic counterpart .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ sec : normalss ] .",
    "recent clas results  @xcite also suggest many opportunities to make advances in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the clas collaboration investigated cascade photoproduction in the reactions @xmath67 as well as @xmath68 and among other things , determined the mass splitting of the ground state @xmath69 doublet to be @xmath70  mev/@xmath71 , which is consistent with previous measurements .",
    "moreover , the differential ( total ) cross sections for the @xmath72 have been determined in the photon energy range from 2.75 to 3.85  gev  @xcite .",
    "the cross section results are consistent with a production mechanism of @xmath73 through a @xmath74-channel process .",
    "the reaction @xmath75 $ ] was also studied in search of excited cascade resonances , but no significant signal for an excited cascade state , other than the @xmath76 , was observed .",
    "the absence of higher - mass signals is very likely due to the low photon energies and the limited acceptance of the clas detector .",
    "equipped with a kaon identification system , the gluex  experiment will be well - suited to search for and study excited @xmath10  resonances .",
    "in the following section , we discuss the current status of the development of the baseline gluex  experiment .",
    "the gluex  experiment was first presented to pac  30 in 2006  @xcite . while beam time was not awarded for 12  gev proposals at that pac ,",
    "the proposal suggested a three phase startup for gluex , which spanned approximately the first two calendar years of operation .",
    "phase i covered detector commissioning .",
    "phases ii and iii proposed a total of @xmath77  s of detector live time at a flux of @xmath78/s for physics commissioning and initial exploratory searches for hybrid mesons . in 2010 , an update of the experiment was presented to pac  36 and a total of 120 days of beam time was granted for phases i - iii .    in 2008 , two critical detector components were  de - scoped \" from the design due to budgetary restrictions .",
    "first , and most importantly , the forward cherenkov particle identification system was removed .",
    "the other component that was taken out was the level - three software trigger , which is needed for operating at a photon flux greater than @xmath78/s .",
    "these changes severely impact the ultimate scientific goals and discovery potential of the gluex  experiment , as was noted in the pac report :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ finally , the pac would like to express its hope that the de - scoped cherenkov detector be revisited at some time in the future .",
    "the loss of kaon identification from the current design is a real shame , but entirely understandable given the inescapable limitations on manpower , resources , and time .",

    "a kaon identification system will also provide the capability needed to study doubly - strange @xmath10 baryons . in the remainder of this section , we review our progress toward the baseline gluex  construction , which is aimed at phases  i - iii of running .",
    "sections  [ sec : ss_meson ] and  [ sec : xi_baryon ] discuss the physics motivation for phase  iv , and section  [ sec : hardware ] covers the phase  iv hardware and beam time requirements .      a schematic view of the gluex  detector is shown in fig .  [ fig : detector ] .",
    "all major components of the detector are under construction at jefferson lab or various collaborating institutions .",
    "beam for the experiment is derived from coherent bremsstrahlung radiation from a thin diamond wafer and delivered to a liquid hydrogen target .",
    "the solenoidal detector has both central and forward tracking chambers as well as central and forward calorimeters .",
    "timing and triggering are aided by a forward time of flight wall and a thin scintillator start counter that encloses the target .",
    "we briefly review the capabilities and construction status of each of the detector components below .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the energy spectrum of photons striking the target ranges from near zero to the full 12  gev incident electron energy . for physics analyses ,",
    "one is primarily interested in only those events in the coherent peak around 9  gev , where there is a signal in the tagger that determines the photon energy . at a rate of @xmath78/s , the 120  @xmath82b",
    "total hadronic cross section at 9  gev corresponds to a tagged hadronic event rate of about 1.5  khz .",
    "based on knowledge of the inclusive photoproduction cross section as a function of energy , calculations of the photon intensity in the region outside the tagger acceptance , and estimates for the trigger efficiency , a total trigger rate of about 20  khz is expected . at a typical raw event size of 15  kb",
    ", the expected data rate of 300  mb / s will saturate the available bandwidth to disk  rates higher than @xmath78/s can not be accommodated with the current data acquisition configuration .",
    "for the high - intensity running , we propose the development of a level - three software trigger to loosely skim events that are consistent with a high energy @xmath0 collision . the events of interest will be characterized by high - momentum tracks and large energy deposition in the calorimeter .",
    "matching observed energy with a tagger hit is a task best suited for software algorithms like those used in physics analysis .",
    "it is expected that a processor farm can analyze multiple events in parallel , providing a real time background rejection rate of at least a factor of ten . while the exact network topology and choice of hardware will ultimately depend on the speed of the algorithm",
    ", the system will need to accommodate the 3  gb / s input rate , separate data blocks into complete events , and output the accepted events to disk at a rate of @xmath83  mb / s .",
    "the software trigger has the added advantage of increasing the concentration of tagged @xmath0 collision events in the output stream , which better optimizes use of disk resources and enhances analysis efficiency .",
    "a simple estimate indicates that the implementation of a level - three trigger easily results in a net cost savings rather than a burden . assuming no bandwidth limitations ,",
    "if we write the entire unfiltered high - luminosity data stream to tape , the anticipated size is about 30 petabytes per years , which is higher than our phase iv average rate of @xmath84 by a factor of two ; however , other factors that would increase the data volume , such as event size increases due to higher - than - estimated noise or the additional data size associated with a rich detector , have not been included . ] .",
    "estimated media costs for storage of this data at the time of running would be $ 300k , assuming that no backup is made .",
    "a data volume of this size would require the acquisition of one or more additional tape silos at a cost of about $ 250k each .",
    "minimum storage costs for a multi - year run will be nearing one million dollars .",
    "conversely if we assume a level - three trigger algorithm can run a factor of ten faster than our current full offline reconstruction , then we can process events at a rate of 100  hz per core . the anticipated peak high luminosity event rate of 200  khz would require 2000 cores , which at _ today s costs _ of 64-core machines would be about $ 160k . even if a factor of two in computing is added to account for margin and data input / output overhead , the cost is significantly lower than the storage cost .",
    "furthermore , it is a fixed cost that does not grow with additional integrated luminosity , and it reduces the processing cost of the final stored data set when a physics analysis is performed on the data .",
    "the collaboration has started a program to develop a detailed and final conceptual design for a forward particle identification system .",
    "as demonstrated , the existing gluex  software framework will permit a simulation of reactions of interest in addition to providing the capability to analyze the impact of additional detector material on existing calorimeter and tracking performance .",
    "the development of a kaon detector will be a multi - institutional effort .",
    "currently , simulations of kaon production are being carried out at florida state university .",
    "jefferson lab has contributed to optimization of the mirror design for the gas cherenkov detector in addition to the conceptual development of the hbrich .",
    "this year , massachusetts institute of technology , a group that has experience with the rich detector at lhcb , has joined the collaboration with the desire to take a lead role in the construction of a forward particle identification system .",
    "a workshop has been organized for may 2012 in order to develop a plan for moving towards a complete design .",
    "the collaboration has set a goal of converging on a design decision by the fall of 2012 so that an accurate cost estimate can be obtained .",
    "it is expected that key proponents within the collaboration will initially seek funding through appropriate nsf and doe programs , _",
    "e.g. , _ the nsf major research instrumentation program or the doe early career award program , to fund the construction of the detector .",
    "it should be noted that the member institutions of gluex  have significant detector construction capabilities  most major detector systems have been constructed offsite at gluex  institutions .",
    "as construction of the baseline gluex  detector will be complete at the institutions by 2014 , resources may be redirected to assist in the construction of a forward particle identification system .",
    "the level - three trigger can largely be developed as proposed in the initial gluex  design .",
    "the present baseline data acquisition system has been carefully developed so that a level - three software trigger can be easily accommodated in the future .",
    "given the standardized approach to data acquisition and networking in place at jefferson lab , the lab staff would have to play a key role in developing and deploying the level - three trigger . as noted above , at the gluex  design intensity of @xmath85s , the operational cost of managing all of the data produced by the experiment",
    "will likely outstrip the one - time hardware cost associated with developing a level - three trigger .",
    "in summary , we propose an expansion of the present baseline gluex  experimental program to include both higher statistics and the capability to detect kaons over a broad range of phase space . this detection capability would allow the identification of meson states with an @xmath31 component and the search for doubly - strange @xmath10-baryon states .",
    "the program would require 220 days of beam time with 9  gev tagged photons at an average intensity of @xmath86 .",
    "the data taking will be divided into an initial twenty - day commissioning period for the phase  iv hardware and then a 200-day production phase  iv physics run .",
    "the phase  iv running will provide an increase in statistics over the approved phase  ii and iii gluex  runs by an order of magnitude . to execute this program ,",
    "a new forward particle identification system will be developed in order to supplement the existing capability of the forward time - of - flight system .",
    "in addition , a level - three software trigger is needed to provide an order of magnitude reduction in the rate at which background photoproduction events are written to disk , which would allow the experiment to run efficiently at high intensity and minimize the final disk and tape resources needed to support the data . with these enhanced capabilities ,",
    "gluex  will be able to conduct an exhaustive study of both @xmath31 and @xmath80 mesons , thereby providing crucial experimental data to test the quantitative predictions of hybrid and conventional mesons that are emerging from both lattice calculations and other models of qcd .",
