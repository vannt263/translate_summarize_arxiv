    "compounds with elements containing 4@xmath18- and 5@xmath18-electrons , such as ce , yb , and u , have been subjects of intense research over the past several decades .",
    "rich physics displayed within this class of materials can be directly attributed to the interaction of @xmath18-electrons with conduction electrons , which leads to , among other aspects , competing ground states .",
    "heavy electron ground states are often thought to be a consequence of the kondo exchange interaction , @xmath11 , between the @xmath18- and conduction @xmath19-electrons  @xcite . at each site",
    "this interaction favors the formation of the local @xmath18-@xmath19 kondo singlet and leads to large effective masses of the charge carriers .",
    "the same @xmath18-@xmath19 exchange term also leads to the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky )  @xcite magnetic coupling between the @xmath18-ions mediated by the polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "the latter effect generally favors long - range magnetic ( often antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ) ground state of the @xmath18-ions .",
    "competition between the kondo effect and rkky interaction was originally addressed by doniach in the 1d - chain model  @xcite , for different values of the afm kondo coupling . at low @xmath11 the long - range afm ground state of @xmath18-ions",
    "is stabilized . with increasing @xmath11 the afm ground state",
    "is suppressed , yielding to a kondo screened state beyond a critical value , @xmath13 .",
    "pressure can be effective in changing on - cite @xmath11 by increasing the overlap between the _ f _ and _ c _ states .",
    "a number of compounds were discovered that are located in the vicinity of the @xmath8=@xmath20 phase transition between the heavy fermion ( hf ) and afm ground states , often manifested as a quantum critical point ( qcp ) . non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior displayed by compounds in the vicinity of qcps , such as the divergent sommerfeld coefficient",
    ", @xmath6@xmath21@xmath22ln@xmath8 behavior found in cecu@xmath23au@xmath24  @xcite , ybrh@xmath25si@xmath25  @xcite , and cecoin@xmath26  @xcite , linear , in temperature , resistivity , and other anomalous properties , provides additional impetus to research on competition between hf physics and magnetism .",
    "the nfl behavior in @xmath27- and @xmath18-electron systems is reviewed , for example , in refs .  .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical attempts to model such systems using the periodic anderson model  @xcite and kondo lattice model  @xcite . a mean field model of the kondo lattice including the nearest - neighbor magnetic interaction  @xcite yields a reduction in the kondo temperature , @xmath14 , at @xmath11@xmath28@xmath13 compared to its value for a single impurity .",
    "this result emphasizes the importance of the rkky coupling even when the system is in the kondo ( hf ) ground state . on the other hand , for @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 , on the afm side of the qcp in the doniach analysis , a mean field renormalization group approach  @xcite provided a good agreement between theory and the experimental results  @xcite on the pressure - tuned afm transition temperatures in a series of ce@xmath29si@xmath25 ( @xmath8=ru , rh , and pd ) compounds .",
    "however , the interplay between the kondo and rkky interactions in this regime is not yet fully understood  @xcite , and additional work , both theoretical and experimental , is needed . in this paper",
    "we provide an example of a compound which orders magnetically at low temperature , in the regime where previously studied compounds display dominant kondo screening .",
    "an alternative to the pressure route of tuning the relative strength of the kondo screening and afm coupling is via synthesis , i.e. crystallographic structure of the compounds . for a specific value of the on - site @xmath18-@xmath19 exchange constant",
    "@xmath11 one expects the rkky interaction , which decays as a power law in @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the fermi momentum and @xmath32 is the distance between the magnetic ions , to become weaker the further the @xmath18-atoms are separated from one another . as a result , the kondo screening should commonly win over magnetic ordering in such dilute systems",
    ". it would therefore be particularly interesting to explore the @xmath18-electron bearing compounds with large @xmath18-@xmath18 nearest neighbor distances .",
    "several stoichiometric dilute @xmath18-electron compounds have been useful in this regard .",
    "ce - based filled skutterudites ce@xmath33 ( @xmath8@xmath34fe , ru , os ; @xmath35@xmath34p , as , sb , @xmath36@xmath57@xmath37 ) form one of these families , with most members semiconducting with the gap size that correlates with the lattice constant@xcite .",
    "another example is a family of yb - based hf compounds yb@xmath38zn@xmath39 ( @xmath40@xmath34fe , co , ru , rh , os , ir , @xmath41@xmath56@xmath37 )  @xcite , where the kondo physics appears to dominate the rkky interaction , in accord with the simple argument above .",
    "the approach of synthesizing compounds with large @xmath18-@xmath18 nearest neighbor distance also turned out to be useful in the studies of electronic correlations in uranium compounds .",
    "large u - u distance @xmath42@xmath56@xmath37 in u@xmath43zn@xmath39 ( @xmath1@xmath34co , rh ) family of materials reduces the overlap between the 5@xmath18-electron wave functions , allowing for observation of sharp crystal electric fields , a situation very rare in u compounds  @xcite . at the same time , this u - u separation resulted in a good description of the system within a kondo limit of the anderson model , i.e. u@xmath43zn@xmath39 compounds are found to be well on the kondo side of the qcp , similar to the yb@xmath29zn@xmath39 case above , and again in accord with expectations above .",

    "it therefore appears to be a good candidate to continue exploration of correlated electron physics in @xmath18-electron systems , and in particular the competition between the rkky interaction and kondo screening .",
    "ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 is a cubic compound lacking 4-fold point symmetry with three inequivalent sn sites .",
    "recently , we succeeded in growing single crystals of ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 with relatively large physical dimensions ( up to @xmath55@xmath445@xmath445mm@xmath45)@xcite .",
    "previous specific heat , resistivity , and ac - susceptibility measurements uncovered a phase transition at 0.18k .",
    "@xcite however , the origin of the transition was not identified . in this paper , we report the low - temperature specific heat ( @xmath0 ) and magnetization ( @xmath1 ) measurements in magnetic field . from the cusp and the field dependence in @xmath1(@xmath8 ) , which corresponds to the specific heat anomaly , we conclude that ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 is an antiferromagnet with @xmath10=0.18k in zero field .",
    "evolution of @xmath6 and @xmath1 with magnetic field indicates disappearance of afm ordering and subsequent splitting of an @xmath18-electron ground state doublet .",
    "we find that the signatures of the magnetic transition are reasonably close to those described by a spin-1/2 heisenberg model , albeit with notable differences , see below .",
    "this suggests that even for the large distance between the neighboring @xmath46-ions the rkky interaction plays a very significant , or even dominant , role .",
    "single crystals of ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 were grown by sn self - flux method .",
    "the details of the sample growth and the physical properties are described in ref .. specific heat was measured in a she dilution refrigerator with 9 t superconducting magnet by means of a quasi - adiabatic heat pulse method with a ruo@xmath25 thermometer .",
    "the low - temperature high - resolution dc magnetization measurements were performed in a commercial oxford kelvinox dilution refrigerator with 12 - 14 t superconducting magnet .",
    "we used a capacitive faraday magnetometer cell with applied field gradient of 10t / m .",
    "the principle of the magnetization measurement is described in ref .. by comparing the data from a commercial magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ; quantum design ) up to 7 t and down to 2k with that obtained with capacitive method in the same field and temperature range , we are able to determine the absolute value of the magnetization .",
    "we used three samples from different batches labeled as samples # 1 ( 7.18 mg ) , # 2 ( 2.58 mg ) and # 3 ( 3.70 mg ) in the figures in this paper for specific heat measurements .",

    "@xmath0/@xmath8 of la@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 is negligible compared to that of ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 in the investigated temperature range .",

    "this indicates that the crystal electric field ( cef ) ground state of ce@xmath58 in ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 is a @xmath59 doublet .",
    "one remarkable feature of the specific heat of ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 is the long tail above @xmath10 .",
    "as we show below , a substantial part of this tail is due to quantum fluctuations of @xmath18-electron spins above @xmath10 .",
    "however , from our analysis it is likely that other processes , such as residual kondo screening , or frustration of spin - spin interactions play some role .",
    "similar @xmath6 behavior was reported in the structurally frustrated system yb@xmath25pt@xmath25pb  @xcite , for example .    to elucidate the origin of this behavior we performed quantum monte carlo simulations of the spin-1/2 three - dimensional heisenberg model in zero and applied magnetic field .",
    "the exchange interaction was fixed to have the afm ordering temperature of @xmath10=0.18k for @xmath60=0 , while the @xmath61-factor of the spins was determined from the saturation magnetization at high fields ( see below ) .",
    "the results for zero field specific heat and entropy are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the model calculations and experimental data is rather good . in particular , the behavior of the entropy below @xmath10 is very similar , and the entropy at @xmath10 for model calculations is about 0.55@xmath48ln2 , about 10% larger than the experimental value .",
    "the most notable difference is that experimental entropy is lower than the calculated values above the transition , indicating that some degrees of freedom remain `` locked '' .",
    "this discrepancy is also seen from the somewhat longer tail of the measured specific heat in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) relative to the heisenberg model .",
    "such contribution may still be due to remnant kondo physics . recall that the distance between ce ions is large , and therefore rkky exchange , and correspondingly the critical @xmath13 , is reduced . in the framework of doniach phase diagram , the only situation when rkky interaction can still dominate the kondo coupling",
    "is when the bare exchange @xmath11 is very small .",
    "ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 is therefore in the low @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 limit of the doniach phase diagram , and the system orders magnetically below @xmath10=0.18k .",

    "the feature associated with the afm order is suppressed entirely .",

    "the kondo temperature @xmath14 is expected to be exponentially small in this regime , and a @xmath99 dependence of the rkky interaction stabilizes the afm ground state _ in spite _ of a large distance between the ce ions .",

    "the afm transition is more robust to the magnetic field , compared to experimental data in low field regime .",
    "we raised a number of questions with regard to the possible origins of this discrepancy , such as magnetic field dependence of the rkky interaction , and frustrating effects of the next nearest neighbor interactions , and point to a number of fruitful future theoretical inquiries .",
    "further experiments will be needed to explore the details of the disappearance of the afm state in ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 , as well as the origin of the long temperature tail of the specific heat above @xmath10 , and potential role of magnetic frustration .",
    "experiments under pressure in particular can help answer why @xmath10 is so low in ce@xmath2pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 compared with other ce compounds , as well as search for pressure induced superconductivity , occasionally found in the vicinity of pressure induced qcp at @xmath100 ( @xmath10@xmath970 ) .",
