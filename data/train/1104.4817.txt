    "spin - based qubits utilizing semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are believed to be the prospective candidate for quantum information processing.@xcite recently , silicon qds have attracted much attention due to their outstanding spin - related properties.@xcite specifically , the hyperfine interaction can be reduced by isotopic purification.@xcite the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling ( soc)@xcite is absent thanks to the bulk - inversion symmetry and the soc induced by the interface - inversion asymmetry ( iia ) is rather weak.@xcite moreover , the electron - phonon interaction , which plays an important role in spin relaxation , is much weaker than that in iii - v semiconductor qds since there is no piezoelectric interaction in silicon.@xcite all these special properties together lead to a long decoherence time in silicon qds , which is of great help in the process of coherent manipulation and information storage .",
    "furthermore , the physics in silicon is considerably rich owing to the presence of the valley degrees of freedom .",
    "silicon has sixfold degenerate conduction band minima , which can be splitted by either strain or confinement in quantum wells into two parts : a fourfold - degenerate subspace of higher energy and a twofold one of lower energy .",
    "the twofold degeneracy can be further lifted by a valley - splitting energy due to the interface scattering .",
    "the valley - splitting energy has a strong dependence on the confinement length of the structure.@xcite    nowadays , spin qubits in silicon single and double qds have been actively investigated.@xcite in silicon single qds , we have studied the singlet - triplet ( st ) relaxation by explicitly including the electron - electron coulomb interaction and the multivalley effect .",
    "our results in the voigt configuration agree quite well with the recent experiment by xiao _",
    "et al._.@xcite silicon double qds , which have been proven very useful in exploiting the spin coulomb blockade,@xcite have also attracted much attention .",
    "recently , raith _",
    "et al._@xcite studied the magnetic - field and interdot - distance dependences of spin relaxation in single - electron si / sige double qds .",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the exchange coupling between the unpolarized triplet and the singlet on the basis of a large valley splitting .",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the multivalley effect on the feasibility of initialization and manipulation of st qubits , showing that the valley degree of freedom makes the physics of si qds quite different from that of single - valley ones . in their work , they analyzed the spectrum with the lowest few basis functions .",
    "as will be shown in this paper , these lowest basis functions are enough for the convergence of the energy spectrum under investigation , but are inadequate to study the st relaxation time , similar to the situation of iii - v semiconductor - based qds.@xcite the relaxation rates calculated with these lowest basis functions and the convergent ones differ by about four orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to employ the exact - diagonalization approach with a large number of basis functions in order to have the correct st relaxation rates .",
    "moreover , the electron - electron coulomb interaction , which is crucial to the energy spectra and the wavefunctions of the singlet and triplet eigenstates , was not explicitly calculated in the literature but rather given as a hubbard parameter.@xcite    in this work , we calculate the two - electron st relaxation in sige / si / sige double qds by explicitly including the coulomb interaction , the valley degree of freedom as well as the source of the st relaxation , i.e. , the socs.@xcite we employ the exact - diagonalization method to obtain the energy spectrum and the fermi golden rule to calculate the spin relaxation rates.@xcite without losing generality , we focus on a large valley splitting case where the lowest singlet and three triplet states are all constructed by the lowest valley eigenstate .",
    "we investigate the double qd system with either a perpendicular magnetic field ( the faraday configuration ) or a parallel one ( the voigt configuration ) .",
    "we find that the energy levels of the lowest singlet and three triplet states have a strong dependence on the external magnetic field and the interdot distance .",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field affects the energy levels mainly by the orbital effect and the zeeman splitting while the parallel magnetic field only influence the energy levels via the zeeman splitting due to the strong confinement along the growth direction .",
    "the interdot distance has a strong influence on the coulomb interaction and the orbital energy .",
    "besides , we also find that the transition rates of the channels among these four levels can be markedly modulated by the external magnetic field and the interdot distance .",
    "moreover , from the dependences of the energy spectrum on the magnetic field and the interdot distance , we observe the anticrossing points between the singlet and one of the triplets . in the vicinity of the anticrossing point , the transition rates of the channels relevant to these two states present either a peak or a valley .",
    "furthermore , we also study the effect of the electric field on the energy levels and the transition rates . with the increase of the electric field , we find that the configurations of the lowest four levels change from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 indicates the numbers of occupancy of the left and right dots . very different from the magnetic - field and interdot - distance dependences , we find that the transition rates are almost independent of the electric field .",
    "this property is of great importance in the spin manipulation , since the lifetime remains almost unchanged during the variation of qubit configurations .",

    "the features of the transition rates in the vicinity of the anticrossing points are also emphasized .",

    "@xmath110 is given by @xmath111 [ eq13 ]    as two - electron basis functions are nonorthogonal , we also calculate the overlap between these basis functions .",
    "one finds that these two - electron basis functions can be divided into three independent subspaces according to the valley index , i.e. , @xmath99 and @xmath112 , as there is nearly no couping between them due to the negligibly small intervalley coulomb interaction@xcite and overlap between the wave functions in different valleys.@xcite then one can diagonalize the eigen equation @xmath113 in each subspace separately and obtain corresponding two - electron energy spectra and eigenfunctions , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 stand for the two - electron hamiltonian and overlap matrix in the subspace with the valley index @xmath116 ( @xmath99 or @xmath112 ) respectively.@xcite we identify a two - electron eigenstate as singlet ( triplet ) if its amplitude of the singlet ( triplet ) components is larger than 50  % .",
