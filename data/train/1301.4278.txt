    "numerous reports on the performance of high power fiber amplifiers have noted a striking instability in the spatial profile of the output beam . above a sharp threshold power",
    "the signal beam quality degrades@xcite , rendering the amplifier unsuitable for coherent beam combining . in previous papers we demonstrated that stimulated",
    "thermal rayleigh scattering can cause this modal instability@xcite .",
    "this stimulated process amplifies a weak , frequency shifted , higher order mode from a low initial power to a level comparable to the power in the fundamental mode .",
    "the necessary high gain leads to a sharp power threshold .",
    "this gain mechanism requires a small red frequency shift of the higher order mode relative to the fundamental mode .",
    "the frequency shift that produces the highest gain typically lies in the range 300 hz to 3 khz and depends on the fiber parameters and operating conditions . at powers below the instability threshold",
    "the spectrum of the amplified light in the higher order mode is primarily a stokes shifted version of the light in the fundamental mode .",
    "well above threshold the stokes shifted light in the higher order mode is strong enough to amplify twice stokes shifted light in the fundamental mode . far above threshold",
    "this leads to a cascade of frequencies at multiples of the stokes shift , giving a comb of frequencies for both transverse modes .",
    "in addition , high order modes other than lp@xmath0 can be excited with various frequency shifts . in this paper",
    "we use numerical simulations to study the behavior of the modal powers and their spectra at pump powers ranging from slightly below to somewhat above the first instability threshold .    a recent experimental paper by otto",
    "_ et al._@xcite provides measurements of mode beating spectra and its evolution with output power in the vicinity of threshold .",
    "we will compare our model predictions with their results .",
    "the experimental results are for a counter - pumped amplifier .",
    "however , modeling the counter - pumped fiber using our current model is prohibitively time consuming , so we model a similar co - pumped fiber instead . the source of difficulty for the counter - pumped amplifier is that our model integrates all optical fields from the signal input end of the fiber to the signal output end .",
    "this requires that we specify the pump power at the signal input end .",
    "this is not a problem for a co - pumped fiber , but it implies that to match a target modulation level for the applied pump power for a counter - pumped fiber we must precompensate the modulation of the pump at the signal input end .",
    "this is an iterative procedure that sometimes requires a large number of model runs .    further complicating counter - pumped behavior near and above",
    "the instability threshold is a positive feedback effect .",
    "the higher order mode is usually less efficient than the fundamental in extracting energy from the pump , particularly if the yb@xmath1 doping is confined to the center portion of the light guiding core .",
    "this implies that when the signal light is transferred from the fundamental mode to the higher order mode near the output end of the fiber , the pump light penetrates deeper into the fiber , leading to earlier mode switching .",
    "this feedback tends to make the transition from the fundamental mode to the higher mode more abrupt in counter- than in co - pumped fibers .",
    "it may also accentuate the exchanges of power between the fundamental and higher order mode that will be described below .",
    "for these reasons the modeled performance of the co - pumped fiber is not expected to quantitatively match the experimental counter - pumped amplifier .",
    "however , we expect a comparison of qualitative similarities to provide a strong test of our proffered mode coupling mechanism and our numerical model .",
    "detailed modeling of the counter - pumped fiber operating above threshold must await further speed up of our numerical model .",
    "descriptions of our numerical model were published earlier @xcite , and we plan to present full mathematical details in a future paper .",
    "we use the amplifier parameters listed in table [ tab.table2 ] throughout this paper .",
    "they are chosen to nearly match the fiber labeled lpf45 in @xcite , but with a somewhat larger mode field diameter of 68 @xmath2 m .",
    "as in lpf45 , the yb@xmath1 doping is confined to a diameter of 63 @xmath2 m which is somewhat smaller than the core diameter of 81 @xmath2 m .",
    "other important model parameters include a @xmath3 spatial grid , a 64 point per cycle time grid , and a propagation step length of 6 @xmath2 m .",
    "we use a step index profile to approximate the photonic crystal guiding of lpf45 .",
    ".parameters of test amplifier . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for comparison with the measured modulation of the output signal presented in @xcite , we analyze the depth of modulation at the beam center as a function of pump power .",
    "figures 3 and 4 of @xcite display the amplitude modulation of the signal power as the pump power is swept through the region of the instability threshold .",
    "the amplifier studied for those figures was different from lpf45 , but presumably lpf45 behaves similarly . in the measurements",
    "a small detection aperture was positioned near the beam center so it measured primarily the amplitude modulation of the lp@xmath4 mode .",
    "their figures show that the standard deviation of the signal power , normalized to the average of the pump power , increases from zero to approximately 0.5 over a power range of 80 to 160 w. we have computed a similar plot of beam center modulation using our model and display it in fig .",
    "[ fig.modulation ] .",
    "it shows how the same measure of modulation used in @xcite increases from zero to approximately 0.5 as the pump power increases from 0.45 to 0.75 .",
    "the simulation result is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental result , at least up to a normalized power of 0.7 .",
    "amplitude modulation at the beam center versus pump power .",
    "the vertical axis is the standard deviation of the signal power normalized to the time averaged signal power.,width=415 ]      otto _ et al._@xcite also reports measured power modulation of the signal at various positions in the output beam .",
    "they transformed the amplitude modulated power to frequency and plotted the spectral powers .",
    "we have computed the same type of spectrum at one location near the beam center where both lp@xmath4 and lp@xmath0 are strong .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.pixelspec ] . like otto",
    "_ et al._@xcite we find there are at least three harmonics of 350 hz with diminishing powers . for other pixels",
    "the same three lines appear in the simulated spectra but the relative heights vary .",
    "spectral power of the amplitude modulated signal power at pixel ( 31,32 ) for the pump power of 0.645 .",
    "the widths of the peaks are an artifact of the fourier transform.,width=415 ]      we also spectrally resolve the individual fiber modes . as mentioned earlier , for the baseline case",
    "in which there is no modulation of the input pump or signal , the sub threshold modal spectra consist of a single unshifted spectral line for lp@xmath4 and a single stokes shifted line for lp@xmath0 , matching the signal seed spectra .",
    "well above threshold of the baseline amplifier , the lp@xmath0 mode begins to amplify a doubly stokes shifted lp@xmath4 mode , plus other modes such as lp@xmath5 , also at the doubly shifted frequency . at such high powers",
    "the spectrum of lp@xmath4 consists of lines with stokes shifts of ( 0,2)@xmath6 while the spectrum of lp@xmath0 has lines at ( 1,3)@xmath6 . at still higher powers the spectra add more lines with the two modes populating alternating frequencies .",
    "the spectra are more complex when the modulated pump is used .",
    "figure [ fig.modalspec ] shows modal spectra at pump powers 0.58 and 0.68 .",
    "well below threshold ( not shown ) both modes have weak , symmetric sidebands . slightly above threshold , at pump power 0.58",
    ", the stokes sidebands of lp@xmath0 are amplified relative to the unshifted light , as shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig.modalspec ] .",
    "the center of weight of the lp@xmath0 spectrum is stokes shifted relative to that of the nearly centered lp@xmath4 spectrum at this power . at the higher pump level of 0.68 , shown in the lower plot",
    ", the lp@xmath0 light is beginning to convert back to lp@xmath4 with an additional stokes shift , and an evolving red shift of lp@xmath4 becomes apparent .",
    "modal spectra near threshold ( upper plot ) and well above threshold ( lower plot ) .",
    "the frequencies are slightly shifted for clear display .",
    "the conditions are the same as in fig .",
    "we think several of the observed features of amplifier performance reported in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that their amplifier is pumped or seeded by modulated light , although we have no direct information about this .",
    "we have modeled a similar amplifier design with the assumption of a slightly amplitude modulated pump .",
    "this produces several changes compared with the baseline case in which the same amplifier in pumped with unmodulated light and with mode lp@xmath0 seeded by stokes shifted light at the quantum noise level .",
    "the addition of pump modulation induces amplitude modulation of the individual seeded modes which in turn produces frequency side bands on all modes , making the modal spectra more complex . above threshold",
    "the modal amplitude modulation becomes quite strong , in contrast to the unmodulated pump which produces much weaker modal modulation .",
    "our simulation results appear to agree qualitatively with all of the key observations of @xcite if we assume that the pump is slightly amplitude modulated at 350 hz .",
    "modulation of the signal input would produce qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "we believe this qualitative agreement between model and measurement strongly supports the mode coupling mechanism we have proposed and implemented in our numerical model .",
    "examination of the laboratory pump light and signal seed light for evidence of amplitude modulation would provide a further critical test .",
    "finally , we note that we make several approximations in our model , including use of a step refractive index in place of the photonic crystal light guiding structure , co - pumping rather than counter - pumping , symmetric cooling with all four sides of our square spatial grid held at a fixed temperature instead of one - sided cooling .",
    "the one - sided cooling used in the experiment is roughly equivalent to a slight bending of the fiber which would displace the modes away from the cooled side .",
    "we also include only one orientation of the lp@xmath0 mode .",
    "all of these approximations can be eliminated in future versions of the model if more experimental details are known .",
    "our next task is to speed up the model to allow modeling of counter - pumped fiber with modulated pump or signal .",
