    "having found the threshold of weak hamiltonicity of @xmath26 and @xmath12 , we naturally wondered whether the @xmath5-uniform hypergraph process , where edges are added to @xmath69 $ ] uniformly at random one after another , satisfies a similar result .",
    "that is , we believe that w.h.p .",

    "if true , this conjecture would generalize to hypergraphs the weak hamilton version of bollobs  @xcite hitting time result .",
    "we actually prove a stronger result than theorem [ theorem : 10.6.1 ] , which says that for any @xmath7 in the critical range , @xmath12 has as large a weak cycle as can be expected .",
    "let @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath12 has a weak cycle spanning all non - isolated vertices .",
    "first , this theorem establishes the first equality in statement * ( i ) * of theorem [ theorem : 10.6.1 ] . to get a handle on the probability that there are no isolated vertices , we have the following lemma .    [",
    "lemma : converge in distribution ] suppose @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath78 denote the number of isolated vertices in @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath78 converges in distribution to a poisson random variable with mean @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , @xmath81    one can prove this lemma using standard techniques by computing the factorial moments of @xmath78 and finding that @xmath82 \\sim ( e^{-c})^r$ ] for any fixed @xmath83 as such , the proof is omitted .    to find this sharp threshold ,",
    "we will follow a hypergraph version of bollobs proof ( see @xcite ) that w.h.p .",
    "@xmath84 is hamiltonian with a few key differences .",
    "we outline the proof of the theorem here , hoping that it will help following the later arguments .    1 .   in section [ sec :",
    "de la vega ] : via an analogue of de la vega s theorem , it will be shown that there is likely a path of length @xmath85 for @xmath7 sufficiently close to but less than the sharp threshold of connectivity .",
    "2 .   in section [ sec : posa ] : we obtain a necessary condition for an extremal path starting at a fixed vertex , which actually says that the set of endpoints of all paths obtained via rotations is  non - expanding . \" 3 .   in section [ sec : nonexpanding ] : then , we show that all non - expanding sets are sufficiently large , which means that the set of endpoints of rotations of a longest path must be large as well",
    ". this will imply that for any such graph , there are sufficiently many non - present edges ( on the order @xmath86 ) such that the addition of any one of these absent edges will connect two endpoints of a longest path creating a cycle .",
    "as long as this cycle is not isolated , we can break apart the cycle to create a longer path than before .",
    "4 .   in section [ sec : increment ] : by increasing @xmath7 in small increments , we will be assured of likely adding one of these beneficial edges from step ( 3 ) .",
    "we keep increasing our edge probability until we finally end with a weak cycle on the set of non - isolated vertices .",
    "the first , and most obvious , difference from bollobs proof , is that certain enumerative issues that are relatively simple for graphs become much more difficult when switching to hypergraphs .",
    "for instance , in the proof that all non - expanding sets must be large , we encounter the probability that each vertex of a set of @xmath87 vertices , denoted @xmath88 , is adjacent to at least one of some @xmath89 vertices , denoted @xmath90 , using only edges contained within @xmath91 . for @xmath23 , this probability is precisely @xmath92 , since for different vertices of @xmath88 , the events that these vertices are adjacent to @xmath90 are independent .",
    "however , for the hypergraph case , these events are definitely not independent , and we introduce a greedy edge finding algorithm , which we analyze to establish a useful bound on this probability ( that we feel is interesting in its own right ) .",
    "second , we are also concerned with @xmath7 in the critical range , where the limiting probability that @xmath12 is weak hamiltonian is strictly between 0 and 1 . in this range , there are possibly isolated vertices , and we need to be more careful about the lack of  small \" non - expanding sets .",
    "further , when we increase our edge probability @xmath7 in small increments , we will end up being forced to do it in 2 large steps rather than just 1 .",
    "just prior to the typical window where the random hypergraph becomes connected , we will show that there is a path of length @xmath85 .",
    "an analogous result , established by fernandez de la vega  @xcite , was used to determine the sharp threshold of hamiltonicity in @xmath93 . here , we prove a hypergraphic version of de la vega s theorem , which in fact is established by the graph version after a key reduction argument . the following statement of de la vega s theorem is in bollobs  @xcite .    [ de la vega ]",
    "let @xmath94 , then w.h.p . there is a path in @xmath95 of length at least @xmath96 .",
    "we will be using the following immediate corollary of de la vega s theorem .",
    "[ cor de la vega ] let @xmath97 , then with high probability , there is a path in @xmath98 of length at least @xmath99    in the following hypergraph analogue of de la vega s theorem , we do not try to obtain the best possible bounds on a likely long path , instead we care only to find sufficient bounds that we will later use to prove our ultimate result .",

    ", there is a path of length at least @xmath105 .",
    "our essential argument is that we decompose @xmath12 into 3 ( random ) hypergraphs @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "first , on @xmath106 , we will prove there is a path of length approximately @xmath109 along only the first @xmath109 vertices ; second , we prove that in @xmath107 , there is a path along only the last @xmath109 vertices ; finally , using the edges of @xmath108 , we concatenate these long paths together .",
    "let @xmath110 and let @xmath111 , for @xmath112 , be random hypergraphs on @xmath19 $ ] , which are _ independent _ and distributed as @xmath113 .",
    "note that @xmath114 is distributed as @xmath115 , where the probability that a generic edge in @xmath116 is present , @xmath117 , is equal to the probability that at least one of @xmath118 have this edge ; in particular @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , @xmath120 and so @xmath116 can be naturally coupled with @xmath12 such that @xmath116 is a subgraph of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to show that w.h.p .",
    "@xmath116 has a path of the desired length .",
    "let s begin with finding a long path in @xmath106 along only the first @xmath109 vertices .",
    "we construct a random graph , @xmath121 , with vertex set @xmath122 $ ] by the following : for each possible edge @xmath123 , i \\neq j$ ] , we define @xmath124 if and only if there is some hyperedge in @xmath125 that contains @xmath126 and @xmath127 but no other vertex of @xmath128 $ ] , i.e. @xmath129 each potential edge in @xmath121 considers distinct potential hyperedges in @xmath125 , and thus the potential edges in @xmath121 are present independently of one another .",

    "there is a path in @xmath121 of length at least @xmath139 which corresponds to a path in @xmath106 of same length spanning only vertices in @xmath140 ( note that the hyperedges that make up this path will include larger index vertices ) .",
    "now for finding long paths in @xmath107 , we construct another random graph , @xmath141 , on @xmath142 $ ] by the following : for each possible edge @xmath143 $ ] , we define @xmath144 if and only if there is some hyperedge in @xmath145 of the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "by the same argument as before , w.h.p . there is a path in @xmath141 of length at least @xmath139 which corresponds to a path in @xmath107 of the same length spanning only vertices in @xmath148 .    using @xmath149 , we will concatenate these paths together .",
    "let @xmath150 denote the event that these long paths exists in @xmath125 and @xmath145 .",
    "on @xmath150 , let @xmath90 be the last @xmath151 vertices of one such long path in @xmath125 and @xmath88 be the first @xmath151 vertices of one such long path in @xmath145 ( both of these are defined because the length of these paths is @xmath152 ) .    by the independence of potential hyperedges of @xmath108 from @xmath106 and @xmath153",
    "@xmath154 which tends to zero .",
    "hence , with high probability these two long paths on distinct vertices exist and there is a hyperedge that contains one of the last @xmath155 vertices , say @xmath89 , of the first path and one of the first @xmath155 vertices , say @xmath87 , of the second path .",
    "we construct our path in @xmath116 by following the long path in @xmath125 until we reach the vertex @xmath89 , then choosing this connecting hyperedge containing @xmath89 and @xmath87 , then following the path in @xmath145 until it ends .",
    "this path has length at least @xmath156 as desired .",
    "now that we have established that paths of length @xmath85 are likely to exist near the connectedness threshold of @xmath12 , our next goal is to show that the sets of endpoints of longest paths are relatively large ( on the order of @xmath137 ) . in the proof of finding the hamiltonicity threshold of @xmath23 ( see  @xcite ) , psa s lemma is indispensable in describing the set of endpoints of these longest paths ; in particular , the set of endpoints is  non - expanding \" .",
    "it plays a similar role here as well .",
    "we begin with a couple of definitions . for a hypergraph , @xmath116 , on @xmath19 $ ] , and a set of vertices @xmath16 , we define @xmath157 as the set of neighbors of @xmath16 . formally ,",
