    "[ 1.0]-lattice - based physical - layer network coding [ 1.0](lnc ) is a type of compute - and - forward ( c&f ) relaying strategy @xcite that is emerging as a compelling information transmission scheme in gaussian relay networks .",
    "lnc exploits the property that integer linear combinations of lattice points are again lattice points .",
    "based on this property , relays in lnc attempt to decode their received signals into integer linear combinations of codewords , which they then forward .",
    "this approach induces an end - to - end network coding channel from which the transmitted information can be recovered by solving a linear system .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a generic lnc scheme that makes no particular assumption on the structure of the underlying nested lattice code , thereby enabling a variety of code - design techniques .",
    "a key aspect of this approach is a so - called `` linear labeling '' of the points in a nested lattice code that gives rise to a beneficial compatibility between the @xmath2-linear arithmetic operations performed by the wireless channel and the linear operations in the message space that are required for linear network coding .",
    "similar to vector - space - based noncoherent network coding ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the linear labelings of this paper induce a noncoherent end - to - end network coding channel with a message space having , in general , a module - theoretic algebraic structure , thereby providing a foundation for achieving noncoherent network coding over general gaussian relay networks .",
    "we study the error performance of a class of hypercube - shaped lnc schemes , and show that the error performance is largely determined by the minimum inter - coset distance of the underlying nested lattice code . by way of illustration",
    ", we adapt several known lattice constructions to give three exemplar lnc schemes that provide nominal coding gains of 3 to 7.5  db while admitting reasonable decoding complexity .",
    "we also study the possibility that a relay may attempt to decode more than one linearly independent combination of messages , and we relate this problem to the `` shortest independent vectors problem '' in lattices @xcite . for this problem , a notion of dominant solutions is introduced together with a lattice - reduction - based algorithm , which may be of independent interest .",
    "lnc can be seen as generalization of several previous physical layer network coding ( pnc ) schemes @xcite .",
    "the earliest pnc schemes were applied to a two - way relay channel in which the relay attempts to decode the modulo - two sum ( xor ) of the transmitted messages .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the xor can be replaced by a family of functions satisfying the so - called `` exclusive law of network coding . ''",
    "furthermore , the choice of function can potentially be adapted to the instantaneous channel realizations , although a complicated computer search may be needed @xcite to choose the function optimally , even in the case of low - dimensional constellations such as @xmath3-qam .",
    "because lnc considers only linear combinations , not general functions , it provides an efficient method , even in high - dimensional spaces , to perform such channel - adaptive decoding .",
    "further pnc schemes presented in @xcite aim to approach the capacities of various two - way relay channels .",
    "a survey of pnc for two - way relay channels can be found in @xcite .        the use of nested lattice codes ( or voronoi constellations ) in pnc was first proposed in @xcite , leading to the development of c&f relaying .",
    "a key feature of the c&f strategy is that no channel state information ( csi ) is required at the transmitters . in contrast to alternative advanced strategies such as noisy network coding @xcite and quantize - map - and - forward strategy @xcite , the c&f strategy does not require global channel - gain information at the destinations .",
    "all of these make c&f an appealing candidate for practical implementation .    the c&f strategy can be enhanced by assuming csi at the transmitters @xcite or by installing multiple antennas at the relays and destinations @xcite .",
    "practical code constructions for c&f are presented ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a recent survey of c&f",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "after the conference publication of an earlier version of this work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , several papers have appeared following our algebraic framework . for example",
    ", the work of @xcite presents several design examples based on eisenstein lattices , which can achieve a shaping gain of 0.167 db compared to our examples based on gaussian lattices .",
    "the work of @xcite studies the existence of asymptotically - good nested lattices over eisenstein integers , which can offer higher computation rates for certain channel realizations compared to the computation rates in @xcite ( which are based on gaussian integers ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : preli ] reviews some well - known mathematical preliminaries that will be useful in setting up our algebraic framework .",

    "section  [ sec : error_prob ] turns to the geometric properties of lnc , presenting a union bound estimate as well as some design criteria .",
    "section  [ sec : design ] contains several illustrative design examples for practical lnc schemes , showing that a decent nominal coding gain is quite possible under practical constraints .",

    "section  [ sec : simulation ] presents simulation results , while section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the role of algebra in pnc with a particular focus on two - way relay channels , where two terminals attempt to exchange their messages @xmath4 through a central relay , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : twrc ] . for this channel model ,",
    "a pnc scheme consists of two rounds of communication . in the first round ,",
    "the terminals simultaneously transmit their signals @xmath5 to the relay , and the relay tries to decode a function @xmath6 of the messages from the received signal @xmath7 . in the second round , the relay broadcasts the decoded function @xmath8 to the terminals , based on which each terminal recovers the other message with its own message held as side information .    to illustrate how a pnc scheme works , we assume that the channels between terminals and the relay are complex - valued flat - fading channels with additive white gaussian noise , that the messages @xmath9 take values in the set @xmath10 , and that ( uncoded ) gray - labeled quaternary phase - shift - keying ( qpsk ) modulation is used , with the signal constellation given in fig .  [ fig : qpsk ] . the channel gains between the terminals and the relay are denoted as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the relay aims to decode the xor of the messages .",
    "we first consider the ideal special case in which the channel gains are precisely unity , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "the received constellation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpsk11](a ) , together with the decision region for xor decoding .",
    "although some received points are overlapping , say point @xmath14 and point @xmath15 , the overlapping points have the same xor value , resulting in no ambiguity .    [",

    "in this paper , the problem of constructing lnc schemes via finite - dimensional nested lattices has been studied .",
    "a generic lnc scheme has been defined based on an arbitrary pair of nested lattices .",
    "the message space of the generic scheme is a finite module in general , whose structure may be analyzed using the smith normal form theorem .",
    "these results not only give rise to a convenient characterization of the message space of the nazer - gastpar scheme , but also lead to several generalized constructions of lnc schemes .",

    "an estimate of the error probability for hypercube - shaped lnc schemes has been derived , showing that the pair of nested lattices @xmath28 should be designed such that @xmath29 is maximized and @xmath30 is minimized .",
    "these criteria lead to several specific methods for optimizing nested lattices .",
    "in particular , the nominal coding gain for pairs of nested lattices has been introduced , which serves as an important figure of merit for comparing various lnc schemes .",
    "in addition , several concrete examples of practical lnc schemes have been provided , showing that a nominal coding gain of @xmath0 to @xmath1  db is easily obtained under reasonable decoding complexity and short packet length .",
    "finally , the problem of choosing multiple coefficient vectors is discussed , which is connected to some well - studied lattice problems , such as the shortest independent vectors problem and the lattice reduction problem .",
    "we believe that there is still much work to be done in this area .",
    "one direction for follow - up work would be the design and analysis of higher - layer scheduling algorithms for lnc schemes .",
    "another direction would be the study of more general shaping methods beyond hypercube shaping .",
    "a particular example along this direction is given in @xcite .",
    "a third direction would be the construction of more powerful lnc schemes , which has been partially explored in several recent papers , e.g. , @xcite .",
