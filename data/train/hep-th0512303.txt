    "although there have been considerable advances in the strong - coupling description of gauge theories since their formulation , this remains an unresolved matter .",
    "a line of attack to this problem has been to analyze related systems with simpler dynamics .",
    "specially successful has been the study of supersymmetric theories , that in some cases can be solved exactly .",
    "however , the applicability of the methods employed usually relay on supersymmetry and can not be used safely for non - supersymmetric theories .",
    "a different and older approach is t hooft s large @xmath1 expansion @xcite , where each term in the expansion is non - perturbative in the coupling constant .",
    "although it gives a good qualitative description of many features of strongly coupled gauge theories , extracting quantitative results for realistic theories has been demonstrated to be a difficult task .",
    "recently , a new combination of both lines has been proposed under the name of planar equivalence @xcite .",
    "starting from a supersymmetric theory , called parent , it is projected to a non - supersymmetric theory , called daughter , so that they are equivalent in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the projections are inspired in string constructions and they are named after orbifolds @xcite and orientifolds @xcite .",
    "orbifold projection relates a @xmath2 @xmath3 supersymmetric gauge theory with a @xmath4 gauge theory with fermions in bifundamental representations under two adjacent gauge group factors .",
    "orientifold projection relates a @xmath2 @xmath5 supersymmetric gauge theory with a @xmath5 gauge theory with fermions in two - index symmetric or antisymmetric representations . for these theories ,",
    "planar equivalence has been proved at the perturbative level , and there are formal proofs of exact equivalence @xcite .",
    "a remarkable example of this program is the computation of the quark condensate in terms of @xmath2 gaugino condensate using orientifold theories @xcite .",
    "further works on finite @xmath1 computations in orientifold theories using string duals can be found in @xcite .",
    "theories with other possible representations of fermions and their planar properties are studied in @xcite .",
    "although the results are encouraging , the exact equivalence is not completely established , specially for orbifold theories , that have been the subject of much discussion @xcite , although there are also some concerns about orientifold theories @xcite .",
    "we want to clarify this point by studying these theories in a dynamically controlled regime , where we can analyze the behavior of both parent and daughter theory and compare them . in order to do that",
    ", we will introduce them in a small spatial torus @xmath6 , where the theory is in a weak coupling regime , so perturbative and semiclassical methods can be used . the first analysis of planar equivalence using finite volume is @xcite , where a single spatial direction was compactified in a circle .",
    "it was shown that the dynamics of the orbifold daughter breaks down planar equivalence for small enough radius , because the sector where it would hold becomes tachyonic .",
    "however , it is not clear that this will remain true when the circle is decompactified .",
    "the extension to a total compactification of space was made in @xcite . in this case",
    "non - trivial flat connections in the torus are zero modes that generate a moduli space . in the small volume limit ,",
    "zero modes control the dynamics of the theory , so we can concentrate on the study of the moduli space . in principle",
    ", quantum corrections can generate a potential of order @xmath7 over the moduli space , but supersymmetry guarantees that a potential is not generated .",
    "planar equivalence boils down to the vanishing of the daughter effective potential to @xmath7 , but it is shown that this is violated locally at some points of the moduli space due to non - linear effects , although it is satisfied on the average . also , the @xmath8 potential makes the physics of parent and daughter moduli space very different .",
    "it seems that the signals of a possible failure of planar equivalence are a consequence of having scalar degrees of freedom that arise when we compactify the theory , and that their effects may disappear when we go to the infinite volume limit .",
    "then , it is interesting to get rid of the moduli space in order to avoid this problem .",
    "this can be done using twisted boundary conditions , that will constitute the frame of this paper .",
    "orbifold theories are invariant under a global @xmath9 group of symmetry , the center , that can be used to introduce twisted boundary conditions and lift most or all of the non - abelian moduli space .",
    "orientifold theories are invariant only under a @xmath10 center group , that is not enough to significantly change the moduli space .",
    "for this reason , this paper will concentrate on orbifold theories .",
    "twisted boundary conditions will allow the construction of a precise mapping of topological sectors between parent and daughter , so we can compare the vacuum sectors .",
    "moreover , we will be able to compare fermionic correlation functions induced by tunneling between vacua in each theory .",
    "ordinary instantons can contribute to such quantities , but they are not useful to answer questions about planar equivalence because their semiclassical contributions vanish exponentially in the @xmath11 limit .",
    "the reason is that their action scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "however , when twisted boundary conditions are introduced , new vacua and configurations associated to tunneling appear .",
    "this new class of tunneling configurations can give a non - vanishing contribution to fermionic correlation functions , since their action scales as a fractional instanton @xmath14 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce twisted boundary conditions and show how they can be used to make a complete map between different gauge bundles of parent and daughter theory .",
    "in section 3 we use this map to describe and compare vacuum states of both theories . in section 4",
    "we extend the analysis to include effects induced by tunneling .",
    "finally , we give a geometrical interpretation in terms of bound states of d - branes and conclude .",
    "we are interested in finding the map between physical configurations of parent and daughter theories relevant for planar equivalence . according to @xcite",
    ", we should compare the vacuum sectors of both theories .",
    "however , this is a difficult task , specially for the daughter theory , because we can not use perturbation theory and we do not have non - perturbative effects under control in the ir limit . in order to avoid these problems ,",
    "we introduce parent and daughter theories in a small finite volume .",
    "this has been an extensively used tool to study asymptotically free gauge theories , since they are in a weak coupling regime where perturbative and semi - classical methods are applicable .",
    "the orbifold theories that we are considering have a @xmath15 gauge group and weyl fermions that transform as the bifundamental representation @xmath16 of two adjacent gauge groups .",
    "these theories can be obtained from a @xmath2 @xmath17 supersymmetric gauge theory after performing an `` orbifold projection '' .",

    "for this kind of theories , it has been proved that parent and daughter planar diagrams give the same result , if the coupling constants of both theories are related by @xmath21 .",
    "we should point that the gauge group of the daughter theory is a subgroup of the gauge group of the parent theory _ of the same rank_. this is quite useful if we try to establish a map between both theories .",
    "for instance , every representation of the parent theory has a unique decomposition in representations of the daughter theory .",

    "twisted boundary conditions were introduced by t hooft @xcite and successfully applied by witten to study supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "the topics we review briefly here can be found more thoroughly studied in these references .",
    "an extensive classical analysis of twisted boundary conditions in @xmath23 can also be found in @xcite .",
    "when we compactify a gauge theory in a three - torus @xmath6 , we have some freedom to specify the boundary conditions of the fields on the sides of the torus . for a @xmath24 gauge group ,",
    "the fields must be periodic up to gauge transformations . in order to be in a configuration with zero field strength , the gauge transformations on each side must commute .",
    "we can always change the boundary conditions by making gauge transformations and redefining our field , so all these configurations are equivalent .",
    "in particular , all can be reduced to the case with trivial periodic boundary conditions , where there are zero modes for the gauge fields given by constant abelian connections .    for the theories we are interested , the fields are invariant under a discrete subgroup of the gauge group , that we call the invariant center . for instance , for a ( supersymmetric )",
    "@xmath24 gauge theory , the center is @xmath25 . as a consequence , we can consider our theory as a @xmath26 theory and impose non - trivial boundary conditions on the fields .",
    "the fields are periodic up to a gauge transformation , but now the transformations on each side need to commute only up to an element of the center . therefore , for each side we can give an element of the center that defines non - equivalent boundary conditions .",
    "the information is encoded in the so - called magnetic flux @xmath27 , which is a three - vector of integers defined modulo @xmath28 .",
    "formally , we are constructing gauge bundles of different topology , using the mapping between non - trivial one - cycles of the group @xmath26 to the torus .",
    "since in general we can not reduce these configurations to the trivial case , there are no zero modes for gauge fields .",
    "imagine that we are in a sector of definite magnetic flux , and we choose to work in the @xmath29 gauge .",
    "this gauge only fixes time - dependent transformations .",
    "when we make a time - independent gauge transformation , it has to satisfy the same boundary conditions as the fields , up to an element of the center .",
    "then , we can introduce an element of the center for each direction that characterizes the twisted gauge transformation .",
    "we can group them in a single three - vector @xmath30 of integers .",
    "twisted gauge transformations are not continuously connected to the identity , so physical states do not need to be invariant under them . as a matter of fact ,",
    "each time we make a twisted gauge transformation we can reach a different sector of the hilbert space . using fourier transformation , we can build states invariant under the action of a twisted gauge transformation , labelled by the electric flux @xmath31 , a three - vector of integers defined modulo @xmath28 .",
    "the information carried by electric and magnetic flux can be encoded in a single quantity @xmath32 , the _ twist tensor _",
    ", that emerges when we study gauge bundles in an euclidean @xmath23 .",
    "as in @xmath33 , we use gauge transformations to glue the sides of the torus .",

    "usually , contributions from ordinary instantons are considered .",
    "they come from bundles associated to the wrapping of the gauge group over a @xmath37 .",
    "then , this contribution is an integer known as the winding number . for gauge bundles associated to the torus , the contribution to topological charge can be fractional , because we are using a representation that is not faithful for @xmath26 . in the sector of zero winding number , the topological charge is given by = 116 ^ 2_^4 f_(x)f_(x)d^4 x = -14 m n _ n_= - 1 m where @xmath38 .",
    "the parent theory is a @xmath24 supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath39 .",
    "all the previous discussion can be applied directly to this case . in order to study the relation between parent and daughter theories in this setup ,",
    "we follow the construction that t hooft used to find self - dual solutions of fractional topological charge @xcite , called torons , and generalize it to our case .",
    "the analysis is made in the euclidean @xmath23 .",
    "we split rows and columns in @xmath20 diagonal boxes of @xmath40 size .",
    "then , we work in the subgroup @xmath41 , which is the orbifold projection on the gauge sector . if we had considered only a @xmath4 theory , without the abelian part , then the possible bundles in the daughter theory would have been characterized by a @xmath9 diagonal subgroup of @xmath42 .",
    "this is so because of the fermions in the bifundamental representations .",
    "if twist tensors of different @xmath5 groups were different , boundary conditions for fermions will not be consistent , according to ( [ eq : consistency ] ) .",

    "a remark is in order .",
    "although in principle we can turn on arbitrary fluxes of abelian fields in the daughter theory , we must take into account the presence of charged fermions under these .",
    "since bifundamentals correspond to off - diagonal boxes in a @xmath3 matrix , the value of abelian fluxes is determined modulo @xmath1 by consistency conditions of the twist .",
    "this implies that fractional contributions of abelian fluxes to the topological charge are determined completely by ( [ eq : conditions ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , integer contributions to the topological charge in the parent theory can map to non - abelian instantonic configurations , abelian fluxes of order @xmath1 or a mixture of both .",

    "the necessary and sufficient condition is that operators related by orbifold projection , and invariant under orbifold transformations , have the same vacuum expectation values .",
    "therefore , it is enough to check the vacuum sector . in infinite volume",
    "it is argued that large @xmath1 equivalence does not hold for @xmath69 because of spontaneous breaking of orbifold symmetry by the formation of a gaugino condensate in the parent theory @xcite .",
    "for @xmath70 the condensate does not break orbifold symmetry and the question remains open .",
    "in finite volume in principle there is no spontaneous breaking , so any failure of large @xmath1 orbifold equivalence must show itself in a different way . in the following analysis",
    "we will restrict to the sector of vanishing vacuum angles for simplicity .",
    "we will start by comparing the bosonic sector of ground states of parent and daughter theories in a three - torus .",
    "the first question we can ask ourselves is what are the relevant configurations we must consider . we assume that the orbifold projection has been made at a scale of energy much larger than the typical scale of the torus @xmath71 . at this point ,",
    "all the coupling constants of the orbifold theory are equal .",
    "the running of coupling constants of non - abelian groups is given at leading order by the renormalization group of the parent theory , by perturbative planar equivalence .",
    "however , the running for abelian groups is different since they are not asymptotically free . as a matter of fact",
    ", the coupling constants of abelian groups will be smaller than the coupling constants of non - abelian groups in our torus , and the difference will increase with the volume .",
    "we can now consider what are the contributions to energy of abelian configurations , that depend on electric ( @xmath72 ) and magnetic ( @xmath73 ) fluxes as h=_^3_l(e^2(l)2 ^2 + 12e^2(l)^2 ) in the quantized theory @xmath74 acts as a potential , while @xmath75 plays the role of kinetic energy .",
    "we see that the magnetic contribution is proportional to the inverse of the coupling , so the ground states of the theory will be in the sectors of zero abelian magnetic flux .",

    ". we can introduce a unit of magnetic flux in the same direction for each of the gauge groups , so we are performing a maximal twist of the theory and thus lifting all the non - abelian moduli space . however , the kind of boundary conditions we are imposing does not prevent the existence of constant connections for abelian groups .",
    "bifundamental fermions are charged under these @xmath22 groups , so it is not possible to gauge away constant connections .",

    "we have freedom to make gauge transformations depending on spatial coordinates .",
    "abelian gauge transformations must be such that they compensate the phases that can appear on fermionic fields if we make twisted gauge transformations that are not equal for all non - abelian gauge groups .",

    "first , the total number of vacua in the parent theory is @xmath59 , in agreement with the witten index .",

    "what is the situation in the daughter theory ?",
    "the only possible candidates to give fermionic zero modes in spite of twisted boundary conditions are the trace part of bifundamental fields .",
    "however , those fields are charged under abelian groups , so it is not possible to find zero modes over the whole moduli space .",
    "we are then confronted to the same kind of concern as in @xcite , the number of vacuum states is different in each theory , even in the sector of vacua that preserve orbifold symmetry .",
    "a necessary condition for planar equivalence to hold is that the vacuum expectation values of orbifold invariant quantities are the same up to factors of @xmath20 given by the orbifold mapping @xcite . in infinite volume",

    "otherwise , the vacua of the parent theory spontaneously break orbifold symmetry @xcite .",

    "@xmath117 , since all abelian gauge groups enter symmetrically and we have applied the renormalization group from a point where all couplings were equal . at that point @xmath118 , where @xmath13 is the non - abelian t hooft coupling .",
    "let us comment several aspects of the abelian moduli space .",
    "we can scale the fields so that the coupling constants come in front of the action .",
    "then , when we make an abelian gauge transformation that shifts the gauge field by a constant , the fermionic field charged under that abelian group picks up a phase depending on the position . for instance , if a_3^i - a_3^i+1a_3^i - a_3^i+1+c_3  _ i , i+1 e^ic_3x_3_i , i+1 then , when we move a period along the @xmath80 direction , the phase of the field changes by @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude that the periods of the @xmath120 components of the abelian moduli space are @xmath121",
    ". would be twisted gauge transformations correspond to @xmath122 translations along the @xmath120 , although fixed boundary conditions for charged fields imply that they are no longer a symmetry of the theory .",

    "the effective potential is very large and does not depend on the coupling .",
    "therefore , the wavefunction is very localized , even for translations given by twisted transformations , and it is more convenient to use a position representation over the moduli space .",
    "the first consequence of all this is that if we make an abelian twisted transformation , we are moving the system to a configuration with more energy , see fig .  1 .",
    "therefore , most of the vacua of the theory are lifted .",
    "only when we make diagonal non - abelian twisted gauge transformations , the system remains in a ground state .",

    "the wavefunctions over the moduli space of parent and daughter theories are very different .",
    "the first one can be seen as a zero - momentum state , while the last is more a position state .",
    "this suggests that in the infinite volume limit the daughter theory will fall into an abelian twisted configuration , breaking orbifold symmetry in that sector .",
    "another difference is that the ground state has a negative energy of order @xmath7 .",
    "these results are of the same kind as the ones found in @xcite , although in the other cases the moduli space was non - abelian for the daughter theory .",
    "we have found many differences between the vacua of parent and daughter theories in finite volume with maximal twist .",
    "we were looking to lift the non - abelian moduli space that in previous works pointed towards non - perturbative failure of planar equivalence .",
    "we have seen that properly taking into account the abelian groups in the daughter theory , the situation does not really improve .",
    "thanks to abelian groups we are able to map the moduli space of parent and daughter theories , but the generation of a potential by fermionic fields in the daughter theory makes the physical behavior of both theories quite different , although it lifts many of the unexpected non - abelian vacua .",
    "the moduli space of the parent theory is also a problem , because it implies that there are fermionic zero modes that generate vacua that can not be mapped to the daughter theory .",
    "we have shown that parent and daughter theories have physically inequivalent vacua in this context due to the potential generated over the moduli space in the daughter theory and to the mismatch of vacua . however , some quantities do not depend on the moduli space , so the wavefunction will just give a normalization factor that can be chosen to be the same",
    ". the orbifold conjecture may still be useful to make some computations in the common vacua , up to kinematical factors .",
    "one of the main applications of twisted boundary conditions is the computation of fermion condensates @xcite generated by tunneling between different vacua .",
    "these fermion condensates do not depend on the moduli space and tunneling can be studied using self - dual solutions of euclidean equations of motion . in the case where the tunneling is between vacua related by a twisted gauge transformation ,",

    "by @xmath137 we refer to the value of the gaugino condensate in the parent theory .",
    "this does not mean that a gaugino condensate is generated by these configurations , we are just referring to the numerical value of ( [ eq : fermionk ] ) .",
    "this is based on the use of torons to estimate the gaugino condensate @xcite and on the coincidence of the instanton measure with the measure of a superposition of torons @xcite .",
    "the factorial factor comes from considering the configuration of charge @xmath138 as a superposition of @xmath20 equal configurations of charge @xmath139 .",

    "however , the whole spectrum is invariant under a @xmath94 rotation of @xmath91 , so there is a non - trivial spectral flow that may become non - analytic and produce oblique confinement in the infinite volume limit .",
    "notice also that there are two well - separated levels in the small volume ( @xmath198 ) limit , where the lifted states have fermionic constant abelian modes . in the opposite limit ,",
    "states of the same electric flux number become nearly degenerate .",
    "this could be a hint for a two - to - one mapping between parent and daughter states of equivalent electric flux , in a finite volume version of the statement made in @xcite .",
    "notice that the parent and daughter `` vacuum angles '' should be mapped as @xmath199 at the orbifold point @xmath200 , as the orbifold correspondence dictates .",
    "indeed , we find that the spectrum of the daughter theory is invariant under @xmath201",
    ". however , this does not look as the right transformation for a vacuum angle and , in view of ( [ eq : daughterenergy ] ) , the daughter vacuum angle seems rather to be @xmath202 , that has the value @xmath203 at the orbifold point .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lifted vacua of the parent theory are unsuitable for a correspondence with daughter states because some matrix elements involving fermions will be different , as we have argued before . regarding the remaining vacua",
    ", there is a quantitative disagreement between parent ( [ eq : parentenergy ] ) and daughter energies ( [ eq : daughterenergy ] ) , given by the difference in the values of the tunneling coefficients @xmath191 and @xmath196 , so it seems that planar equivalence does not work at this level .",
    "we can give a geometrical interpretation of our results based on a construction with d - branes in the torus , as in @xcite .",
    "in the parent theory we will have a set of @xmath59 d4-branes on @xmath23 , the 01234 directions including time .",
    "the low energy theory is a @xmath17 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "we are interested in study possible vacuum configurations , that are characterized by different bundles of d - branes over the torus .",
    "we will ignore the scalars associated to the transverse dimensions to the torus , anyway , they will be spectators in the analysis below .    the twist of the configuration associated to tunneling in the parent theory , sec .",
    "[ sec : parenttun ] , is realized diluting d2-brane charge in the worldvolume of d4s .",
    "the reason are the couplings of d2 charge with @xmath22 first chern class of d4 gauge group _",
    "c_3 f the twist induced in the @xmath22 must be compensated by the non - abelian part , in order to have a well - defined @xmath17 bundle .",
    "so we can introduce @xmath20 units of magnetic flux in the 3 direction and one unit of electric flux in the same direction by introducing @xmath20 d2 branes in 34 direction and a d2 brane in 12 directions .",
    "since the intersection number is non - zero we can interpret also this configuration as having d2 at some angle inside the torus .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the d4s become d0s that can move along the torus . the separation in fractional d0s is encoded in the abelian part of the daughter theory .",
    "the diagonal @xmath22 correspond to the center of mass position , while the @xmath125 group that form the abelian moduli space are the relative separations of d0s in this t - dual interpretation . from ( [ eq : potferm2 ] ) we know that d0s tend to separate , a signal of the orbifold tachyon .",
    "we extend the study of planar equivalence in a small volume @xcite introducing twisted boundary conditions for orbifold field theories .",
    "we have found several sources of disagreement with orbifold large @xmath1 equivalence .",
    "first of all , a ` kinematical ' map seems not to work properly . when we try to embed the vacuum of the daughter theory in the vacuum of the parent theory , we find difficulties because the number of vacua does not match due to the presence ( absence ) of fermionic zero modes in the parent ( daughter ) theory .",
    "we also find difficulties in identifying the relevant configurations for tunneling using only algebraic arguments .",
    "an important ` dynamical ' indication of disagreement with planar equivalence is the formation of a potential over the abelian moduli space of the daughter theory , which makes the ground wavefunction of both theories very different and shifts the vacuum energy at leading order .",
    "these results are analogous to the behavior found for the non - abelian moduli space in the case of periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "when we try to compute contributions produced by tunneling effects in the daughter theory , we find a remarkable relation with a supersymmetric theory .",
    "we can split the contributions in sectors where some factors are identical to quantities of a supersymmetric theory ( to be precise , to the gaugino condensate ) .",
    "however , the relation is with a @xmath2 @xmath5 gauge theory ( or @xmath20 copies of it ) and not with the parent theory , that has group @xmath3 .",
    "we also compute the semiclassical dependence of the energy on the electric flux for the case @xmath70 , but we fail in establishing a quantitative mapping between states of parent and daughter theories .    in view of these results , it seems that the ` supersymmetric ' properties of the orbifold daughter stem from the fact that a @xmath2 @xmath5 supersymmetric sector is ` wrapping ' it , the sector of diagonal configurations .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results @xcite and suggests that planar equivalence of orbifold theories could be traced to the fact that the parent theory and @xmath2 @xmath5 gauge theory are also planar equivalent @xcite . from the point of view of finite volume physics",
    ", the fact that the orbifold theory can be embedded in a supersymmetric theory , the parent theory , apparently has no more meaning except that it is probably a necessary condition for having a supersymmetric sector",
    ". it would be interesting to check whether the properties of the orientifold theory relies on having a @xmath204 supersymmetric sector or work differently to the orbifold case .",
    "i would like to thank j.l.f.barbn for reading the manuscript and making many comments and suggestions and for many useful discussions .",
