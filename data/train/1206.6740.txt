    "ultracold bosonic atom gases in optical lattices have been an ultrahot research area in recent years ( for recent reviews and an extensive reference list see @xcite ) .",
    "they provide means to create and control experimental systems mimicking different condensed matter physics models @xcite .",
    "the interest has been stimulated in part by the fact that there exists @xcite an accurate mapping of continuous hamiltonian to a  hamiltonian on a  lattice  the bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian , originally formulated by gersch and knollman @xcite .",
    "the lattice models significantly ease the analytical @xcite and numerical analysis , though promising new ideas were recently proposed that can enable the analysis in continuous variables @xcite beyond the mean field level @xcite .    bosons in one dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices have also been the area of extensive experimental research @xcite .",
    "the corresponding 1d bh hamiltonian can be effectively addressed numerically by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and related techniques @xcite .",
    "these techniques have broad applications , in particular enable simulations targeting real - life many - body systems @xcite , with controllable error and no systematic errors due to unsounded assumptions .",
    "their success relies on area laws that control the growth of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the entanglement is used as a  small parameter@xcite that makes it possible the construction of an efficient variational set - the so called matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "several numerical investigations of experimental and ` close to experimental ' systems have been performed @xcite .",
    "they focused largely on two aspects : a  quench through a  phase transition and the simulation of absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the phase transition from the superfluid to the mott insulator phase occurs when the lattice depth is increased beyond a  critical value@xcite .",
    "the adiabaticity of this process has been addressed in @xcite . in the second example , the energy absorption rate is analyzed as a  function of the frequency of modulation of the lattice depth @xcite .",
    "the locations , number of peaks in the spectrum and their heights are related to the state of the gas : either superfluid or insulating .",
    "the derivation of the bh hamiltonian assumes the restriction of physics to the lowest bloch band of the optical lattice .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , as the energy gap between the first and second bloch bands is in most cases around 10 times larger than the energy scale in the discrete model .",
    "it is also much larger than the thermal energy scale @xmath0 providing additional argument for a zero temperature analysis .",
    "an early analysis @xcite suggested that higher bands may be included by an appropriate modification of bh hamiltonian parameters for large occupation numbers .",
    "the effects due to higher bloch bands have been also studied for lower densities @xcite in relation to the discovery that higher bands affect the superfluid - insulator transition in bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "this gave explanation for experimental observations of the shift of the superfluid ( sf ) ",
    "mott insulator ( mi ) phase transition @xcite which could not be explained by single - band approaches . in @xcite , the first excited",
    "band is included in a  two - flavour model ; effects of higher bands could also be built in via an effective three - body interaction in the lowest band @xcite .",
    "recently , another approach for 3d optical lattices has been proposed @xcite ( which somehow resemble in spirit @xcite while being used for moderate atomic densities ) . in this approach ,",
    "the higher bands are included in the on - site hamiltonian , which is then diagonalized and many - body ground states of this problem for different total number of particles are used as a  local hilbert space , replacing the usual fock basis @xmath1 the multiband lattice hamiltonian is then expressed in this new basis , yielding an effective single - band model with occupation dependent parameters  renormalized values of the initial hamiltonian parameters for the lowest bloch band .",
    "interestingly , the change of bh hamiltonian parameters is large in the mi regime , where the energy gap is also large , contrary to a  naive intuition .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the derivation of the bh model s effective coupling constants , taking a  closer look at the underlying , quite challenging , numerical problem  the accurate diagonalization of the onsite hamiltonian .",
    "we study how the dimensionality of the optical lattice affects the renormalization scheme .",
    "the dependence on dimension implies that the mean field diagrams of the system no longer depend solely on the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "we then take a  look at the effects of the renormalization of coupling constants on the dynamics in a  1d optical lattice : both quench through the sf - mi transition and the absorption spectroscopy are analyzed .",
    "we find that renormalization of atom - atom interactions significantly shifts and sometimes modifies the absorption peaks .",
    "it also appears to have a  serious effect on adiabaticity predictions for the sf - mi phase transition .",
    "the second quantization hamiltonian for a  dilute gas of interacting bosonic atoms in the optical lattice potential @xmath2 and external trapping potential @xmath3 is of the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an isotropic short - range pseudopotential modelling s - wave interactions @xcite @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the scattering length .",
    "the hamiltonian admits a  natural energy scale , set by the recoil energy @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the optical lattice wavelength .",
    "we assume this energy unit from now on .",
    "the optical lattice potential is typically : @xmath11 if @xmath12 then a  classical setup for a  1d optical lattice is obtained @xcite .",
    "tunneling in @xmath13 directions is highly suppressed and the system may be considered as a  series of independent 1d tubes along the @xmath14 direction .",
    "similarly when @xmath15 a  2d optical lattice is obtained .",
    "when @xmath16 the potential corresponds to a  3d lattice .",
    "let us emphasize that all calculations of renormalized parameters presented below are truly three - dimensional ones , the labels `` 1d '' or `` 2d '' just refering to situations where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are very different .",
    "jaksch and zoller in their seminal paper @xcite introduced a  mapping of ( [ eqn : secq ] ) onto the bh hamiltonian ( here @xmath19 is the local energy shift due to @xmath20 @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 the field operator is expanded in the set of the lowest band wannier functions of the lattice : @xmath23  here @xmath24 denotes the ( real valued ) wannier function localized on site @xmath25 of the lattice for the @xmath26th bloch band ( we shall denote sites by roman subscripts and bands by greek superscripts ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are expressed by the appropriate integrals of wannier functions : @xmath29 ( where @xmath25 and @xmath30 are neighbouring sites ) and @xmath31    however , it turns out that such a single band approximation is often insufficient for realistic values of the parameters , and that contributions of higher bands can not be neglected .",
    "this problem has been studied in the literature in various conditions and using various methods .",
    "of special interest is the situation where the scattering length @xmath7 is large ( near a feshbach resonance ) , where the optical lattice strongly modifies the effective atom - atom interaction , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this is not the situation realized for the @xmath32rb atom in zero magnetic field used in the florence experiment  @xcite where @xmath33 , much shorter than the lattice spacing @xmath34    in this paper , we will consider only situations where the atomic wavenumber @xmath35  being evaluated either in the lowest band or in the excited bands included in the calculation  is such that @xmath36 so that only s - wave low energy interatomic scattering is relevant . in practice , this puts a limit on the number of bands used @xmath37 beyond which the model is not a good approximation of real world .",
    "it is well known that , in dimension higher than 1 , contact interactions can not be modelled by a @xmath38-potential , but require a specific regularization to avoid artificial divergences .",
    "mathematically , a self - adjoint extension of the original hamiltonian is needed  @xcite .",
    "it boils down to a dimension - dependent regularization of the @xmath38-potential  @xcite , which , in 3d , is the so - called fermi pseudo - potential  @xcite used in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vint ] ) .",
    "even with the correct pseudo - potential , one must be careful when expanding over an infinite set of square integrable smooth basis functions ( such as the wannier functions used below ) without renormalization of the interaction strength , because it may lead to incorrect results , such as diverging perturbative expansions , see @xcite for the specific example of two interacting particles in an harmonic trap .",
    "numerical diagonalization , used in the following , leads to less severe problems as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we will use a rather small number of bands ( up to @xmath39=15 ) , so that the highest atomic wavenumbers effectively included in the calculation are still rather small and the divergence of the green function at short distance is just a small perturbation . in other words , although the method we use leads in principle to divergences when @xmath40 these divergences manifest themselves only beyond the largest @xmath39 used in our calculations . note also that the single band approximation described above is free of this problem and pure @xmath38 interactions can be used in these cases .    without restriction to the lowest bloch band",
    ", the expansion in the full wannier functions basis set would give a  multiband variant of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 note that , because wannier functions are smooth , the potential ( [ eqn : vint ] may be replaced by a contact fermi potential @xmath44 in the integral  ( [ eqn : udef ] ) .    by construction @xmath45 for @xmath46 for sufficiently deep optical lattices ( typically @xmath47 ) ,",
    "it is enough to restrict hopping to nearest - neighbor sites , as tunneling amplitudes are exponentially damped with the hopping distance ( for shallow lattice next nearest neighbours hopping may be necessary - see @xcite ) .",
    "a 3d wannier function being a  product of 1d wannier functions , the 3d integral in @xmath48 is a  product of 3 integrals over each coordinate .",
    "the interaction parameters differ for each direction , as wannier functions depend on the lattice depth , which may be different in each direction .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamfull ] ) is difficult to use in practice , even in 1d systems , because the onsite dimension @xmath49 of the @xmath50-particle problem restricted to the lowest @xmath39 bands is @xmath51 ( the onsite problem is genuinely 3d even for a  quasi-1d models ) and moreover the numerical complexity of the best 1d algorithms scales with @xmath49 at least as @xmath52 the complexity of more sophisticated approaches ( such as mera , peps @xcite ) is several orders higher .",
    "thus for computational purposes , one must restrict the local hilbert space . assuming that interactions are on - site only , i.e. @xmath53 for @xmath54 together with considering the lowest bloch band only ( @xmath55 ) @xcite leads directly to the  bose - hubbard hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hambh ] ) , provided we chose the zero of the energy axis at @xmath56    a more sophisticated approach is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the on - site hamiltonian , restriction of ( [ eqn : hamfull ] ) to a single site : @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 ) can be diagonalized to yield a  space of @xmath50 particle ground states .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath59 of the on - site @xmath50 particle ground states @xmath60 are the starting point in determining new values of @xmath27 parameters in the effective hamiltonian . to define renormalized values of @xmath61 the energy @xmath59 has to be decomposed into the interaction energy [ which in case of the bh model , is just @xmath62 and a  single - particle energy ( which in the bh case shifts @xmath63 by the lowest bloch band energy ) .",
    "the most natural way to define the interaction energy would be to use :    @xmath64    unfortunately , @xmath65 can not be defined in such a  way if we request the hamiltonian to have a form resembling eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hambh ] ) .",
    "that is because the single particle energy is no longer a  linear function of @xmath66 this can be circumvented by defining @xmath65 via :    @xmath67    this definition makes hamiltonians ( [ eqn : hambh ] ) and ( [ eqn : hameff ] ) similar .",
    "but @xmath65 is no longer the interaction energy , it also contains contributions of higher bloch bands population to the single - particle energy . from now on we use definition ( [ eqn : un ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath65 depends nontrivially on the geometry of the lattice .",
    "the second stage is to reintroduce inter - site couplings . even if only one band is taken into account ( so that @xmath65 is simply @xmath27 )",
    ", the inter - site interaction @xmath68 induces an effective coupling , which is proportional to the density , that is a term @xmath69 in the effective hamiltonian ( called bond - charge term in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the original tunneling term , it is important only between nearest neighbors as soon as @xmath17 is larger than unity . in the low - density regime ( typically @xmath70 )",
    ", this contribution leads to an increase ( since @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) of the tunneling amplitude @xmath73 the correction is at most of the order of the raw tunneling .",
    "when higher bands are taken into account , the modification of @xmath74 induces a renormalization of the standard tunneling term ( as well as of the bond - charge term ) which becomes also dependent on the occupation numbers of sites between which tunneling occurs .",
    "the effective multiorbital ( emo ) hamiltonian finally becomes :    @xmath75    where @xmath76    this hamiltonian will allow us to study the influence of higher bands on the dynamics later .",
    "first we discuss the accurate numerical determination of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 parameters that , in itself , is a  challenging problem , giving an insight into the physics involved .",
    "the single site problem is equivalent to finding the @xmath50 particle ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : onsiteham ] ) .",
    "if the lowest @xmath39 bloch bands are included ( typical values of @xmath77 4  @xcite , 9  @xcite ) , the problem quickly becomes too involved computationally to be exactly diagonalized , and truncation of the basis has to be performed .    for small particle numbers ,",
    "the problem is dominated by the @xmath78 term .",
    "the direct transition from the lowest to the first excited band is forbidden by symmetry consideration so the relevant energy scale is @xmath79 . promoting a particle from the lowest to the second excited band , via interaction term",
    "is proportional to @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the corresponding interaction integral .",
    "this yields for the validity of the perturbative approach the condition @xmath82 . for typical parameters corresponding to rb scattering length and @xmath17 of the order of 30 ,",
    "@xmath83 yielding the limiting value of @xmath84 .    for small occupation numbers",
    ", a perturbative approach seems justified .",
    "perturbation theory enables us to estimate the impact each excited vector @xmath85 has on the ground state energy .",
    "let @xmath86 be an @xmath50-boson ground ( fock ) state of @xmath78 .",
    "the larger the matrix element @xmath87 and the smaller the energy @xmath88 the larger is the impact .",
    "the perturbative scheme provides a  hint on how to choose an `` optimal '' subset of the basis in which the full problem could be diagonalized . since the exact diagonalization in the variational basis is the last step , we do not follow perturbation theory exactly , but just use it to choose a  close to optimal basis , not to calculate the energy correction .",
    "details of basis generation and variational space sampling are given in the appendix .",
    "a more traditional method @xcite is to choose a  subset according to least energy principle  with minimal @xmath89    we have performed a  detailed analysis comparing both methods for @xmath90 a  strongly coupled case ( 3d optical lattice , @xmath91  parameters taken as typical values from @xcite ) .",
    "we choose a  system with @xmath92 particles and @xmath93 basis vectors according to both least - energy ( as in @xcite ) and the perturbative method ( 39900 vectors are generated within the first order , and 100 within the second order perturbative scheme ) .    the ground state energy",
    " obtained from numerical diagonalization of the on - site hamiltonian in a restricted subset  versus the number @xmath39 of bands included is shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] , for various @xmath50 .",
    "the least energy method clearly gives the false impression of saturation of results if @xmath94 bands are included .",
    "the false saturation occurs because the least - energy method does not evaluate @xmath87 and therefore fills the variational basis with low - energy irrelevant vectors with vanishingly small matrix elements .",
    "the perturbative - like approach does not show similar saturation effects and , moreover , suggests that linear extrapolation of the results may be performed .",
    "we find that the best compromise between computational effort and accuracy is to perform extrapolation of results as a  function of @xmath95 by means of the ansatz @xmath96 the same extrapolation scheme can be used for the @xmath28 parameters ( but leads to less drastic modification of the results ) .",
    "as mentioned above , numerical diagonalization in the set of wannier functions might lead to unphysical divergences as @xmath97 because of the subtle properties of contact interactions in 3d .",
    "one could expect a @xmath95 divergence for large @xmath98 figure  [ fig : comp ] does not show any indication of such a divergence , which could be visible for larger @xmath98    the @xmath65 parameters for the 1d , 2d and 3d lattices are presented in figure  [ fig : uj ] , while the renormalized tunneling amplitudes are shown in figure  [ fig : jplots ] .",
    "we find that , in low dimensions , @xmath65 vary less with @xmath17 compared to the full 3d lattice .",

    "this is easily understood : the alternative effective theory of @xcite expresses the correction to the on - site energy term via a three - body interaction term ( eq .  ( 12 ) of @xcite ) and @xmath100 is simply related to their parameter @xmath101 .",

    "while for the bh case , the main structure is centered at @xmath118 , it has a similar shape , but centered around @xmath176 in the emo case . because of the steep harmonic trap - thus the large changes in local chemical potentials - the structure of the peaks is rather complex .",
    "note the global broadening for the emo case , and an additional peak in the main @xmath176 structure , corresponding to the @xmath177 plateau excitations having an energy larger by roughly @xmath178 , as discussed above .",
    "a second small peak on the right appears at @xmath179 ( emo case ) and @xmath180 ( bh case ) .",
    "it corresponds to a  particle - hole excitation on the edge between the @xmath177 and @xmath181 mott plateaus as identified in  @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows that the spectra becomes quite similar if rescaled by their proper energy scale , @xmath118 or @xmath182    the absorption spectra are quite sensitive to the details of the system .",
    "taking the same parameters for a slightly larger number of particles may create situations where the ground states of the bh and emo hamiltonians significantly differ .",
    "this is then reflected in the absorption spectra .",
    "if the density profile contains a @xmath147 or higher plateau - then the structure of peaks may become more complicated , as discussed above .",
    "we have also compared the absorption spectra in the superfluid regime .",
    "the lattice height is fixed at @xmath183  @xcite .",
    "the system is modulated for @xmath184 with @xmath185 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : figsf ] . unlike in the mott regime , the positions of the absorption peaks are not determined solely by the interaction .",
    "in particular , no global shift of the structure is observed . in both cases ,",
    "one observes a  broad resonance around the recoil energy , with complicated detailed structures .",
    "note that the modulation depth is much smaller than in the mott insulator situation ( to avoid significant excitation of the system ) and therefore the absorbed energy per particle is much smaller than in fig .",

    "@xcite , the starting point is a ultra - cold gas in a  harmonic trap ( without optical lattice ) .",
    "the optical lattices are then ramped up ( assuming @xmath186 ) with an exponential ramp @xmath187 for @xmath188 ms , and a  total ramping duration 100 ms .",
    "the system soon becomes quasi-1d producing a  set of 1d tubes . if a  `` disordered '' system is desired , an additional optical lattice , with different wavelength @xmath189 , is superimposed along the tubes .",
    "this adds a potential @xmath190 for @xmath191 , it acts effectively as the shift of the on - site energy , i.e. an additional pseudo - random disorder @xmath192 where @xmath193 represents the offset between the two optical lattices .",
    "we take a  generic value @xmath194 .",
    "if the ratio @xmath195 is chosen irrational enough , the bichromatic lattice simulates a disorder well enough for a   finite system @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the pseudo - disorder amplitude @xmath196 on time is set by demanding that @xmath197 ( all optical lattices are ramped up simultaneously ) .",
    "we will consider 3 cases : no disorder ( @xmath198 weak disorder ( @xmath199 ) , and strong disorder ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "consider first the no disorder case @xmath201 .",
    "as initial state , we take 151 particles on 81 sites in the presence of a harmonic confinement coming both from the trap and the transverse laser profile .",
    "the detailed procedure using the tebd algorithm is described in @xcite .",
    "after the optical lattice is ramped , absorption spectroscopy is performed for 30ms ( the conversion unit is @xmath202 ) . in the recent numerical investigation of this experiment @xcite , a  discrepancy between experimental  @xcite and numerical results was found .",
    "the reported position of the first absorption peak was 1.9 khz @xcite , while wannier function calculations gave 2.3khz @xcite .",
    "the renormalization procedure renormalizes the value of the @xmath27 parameter to @xmath203 khz , @xmath204 khz , @xmath205 khz .",
    "this suggests that the positions of absorption peaks due to the @xmath206 mott plateaus are : @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 the `` average '' peak position is 1.87 khz .",
    "therefore , the emo hamiltonian provides an estimate of the peak position in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "a  simulation of absorption spectrum performed for this system confirms this finding as shown in figure  [ fig : absingu ] .",
    "although the initial state when the periodic lattice modulation starts is not the ground state , but a wavepacket dynamically created during the ramping of the lattice , the peak positions are well predicted by the emo model .",
    "the position of the first and second peaks agree quite well with the experiment ( the relative height is different presumably because of the strong modulation used in @xcite ) .",
    "the exponential ramping of the optical lattice in the experiment @xcite may not be adiabatic as discussed in @xcite using a  standard bh description . due to the discrepancy in the position of the absorption peak",
    ", the lattice depth was adjusted in @xcite . instead of ramping the lattice up to @xmath210 the final value @xmath211 was considered . in some sense",
    ", such a  simplified approach may be viewed as a renormalization of the bh parameters ( without insight into its origin explained in section [ subsec : modulation ] ) .",
    "let us stress that the agreement between the experimental position of absorption peaks and the emo predictions prove the necessity of using the effective multiorbital theory to explain quantitatively the experimental results .    with that modification of the final @xmath17 value",
    ", it was found using the bh model @xcite that the overlap of the prepared wavepacket on the ground state at the final @xmath17 value was about 9% in the absence of disorder .",
    "it is most interesting to see how taking into account higher bands within effective multiorbital theory affects the adiabaticity of the dynamics .",
    "the simulation performed for the similar exponential ramp starting at @xmath212 up to @xmath213 yields an overlap of the dynamical wavepacket on the ground state at @xmath213 equal to 17.3% .",
    "it may be qualitatively understood : in the emo model , the effective interactions are weaker and the effective tunneling larger allowing particles to redistribute more efficiently among sites during the ramp .",
    "we have also tested an optimized @xmath214 pulse shape as in @xcite . by choosing @xmath214 changing slowly close to the phase transition point for the @xmath147 mott lobe",
    ", we have been able to enhance adiabaticity up to 33% squared overlap with the ground state .",
    "the presence of disorder has devastating influence on adiabaticity , similarly to the standard bh case @xcite .",
    "we have found that for a small disorder , @xmath215 the squared overlap is a  fraction of percent ( 0.005 ) while for the strong disorder @xmath216 it becomes vanishingly small ( of the order of @xmath217 , beyond the accuracy of the calculation ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold . in the first part",
    ", we have presented an efficient numerical implementation of the approach sketched in @xcite which makes it possible to compute the parameters of the effective hamiltonian for bosons in optical lattices .",
    "the approach goes beyond the standard bose - hubbard model @xcite limited to the lowest bloch band .",
    "the effective hamiltonian approach which includes contributions from higher lying bands ( multiorbital approach ) has been shown to lead to new effects and even new phases @xcite for bosonic systems ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our scheme of perturbatively generated basis seems clearly superior to the energy - selected basis used in  @xcite for low and moderate occupation numbers and allows for better estimates of hamiltonian parameters .",
    "these estimates may be extrapolated to an infinite number of bands .",
    "we have applied the method not only to the standard 3d cubic lattice , but also to reduced 1d and 2d problems , where the lattice depth is different in various directions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian obtained depends on the dimensionality of the problem . in effect , mean field phase diagrams as obtained with the gutzwiller ansatz , differ even if they are rescaled by the lattice coordination number .",
    "it turns out that the role of excited bands is even more pronounced for reduced dimensionality problems than for a  3d lattice .",
    "motivated by this difference , we have investigated whether the dynamics is different in a  standard bose - hubbard model and for the effective multiorbital theory .",
    "we have considered two cases , the energy absorption created by modulation of the lattice height and the quasi - adiabatic passage from the superfluid to the mott insulator phase . in both situations",
    ", it turns out that taking into account the density dependent tunneling terms as well as modification of interactions may lead to significant differences between two approaches . for the same lattice depth",
    ", the effective interactions turn out to be significantly weaker than in the standard bose - hubbard model .",
    "this results in profound differences in the absorption spectra such as significant shifts of absorption peaks .",
    "similarly , the full effective theory predicts that the transition from superfluid to mott insulator is more adiabatic than with the standard bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the results presented in the present paper should have a  direct applicability to any experiment using bosons in an optical lattice , with multiple site occupations .",

    "the perturbation theory provides a  way to evaluate a  perturbative contribution of vectors from @xmath241 for arbitrary @xmath242 which , unfortunately , is computationally involved ( summation over intermediate states , degeneracy resolution ) . as we do not calculate the ground state energy within the perturbation theory treatment , but only motivate the choice of a variational basis for numerical diagonalization , the following function :    @xmath243    is chosen to approximate the relevancy measure for vector @xmath244 it minimizes the state s @xmath236 energy and maximizes the overlap .",
