    "interestingly , when @xmath84 numerical plots of solution curves asymptotically approach the line @xmath85 as @xmath86 since solution curves in the region @xmath87 are mirror images of those in the region @xmath88 , these calculations suggest that no solution curve enters the sector @xmath89 .",
    "note that solution curves seem to approach one of two limit curves that follow the @xmath90-axis to the origin then continue along the rays @xmath85 or @xmath91 .",
    "this is indeed the case and was observed and proved by parnovsky @xcite and tee @xcite .",
    "the following is an extension of their work for all @xmath74 .    without loss of generality",
    "assume that @xmath92 and the sign in ( [ inverse2 ] ) is positive so that the particle s trajectory lies in the fourth quadrant .",
    "note that when @xmath93the particle begins to move away from the origin and the sign in ( inverse2 ) is reversed .",
    "we will show that equation ( [ critequation ] ) holds for exactly one positive real value by investigating the zeros of the polynomial @xmath94since @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the intermediate value theorem tells us that @xmath97 for some @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath99but @xmath100 for all @xmath101 so @xmath102 is increasing and @xmath103 is unique .",
    "let @xmath104since solution curves are symmetric in the line through @xmath105 and the origin , we can determine the least upper bound of the polar angle @xmath106 by evaluating its limit as @xmath107 . using equation ( [ turningpoint ] )",
    "we can express @xmath108 in terms of @xmath103 by @xmath109then , equation ( [ theta ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath110let @xmath111 ; then ( [ integral ] ) reduces to @xmath112now , for @xmath113 , we have that @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , @xmath115 finally , it follows by an application of the dominated convergence theorem that @xmath116    now , by symmetry the maximum polar angle of the particle is less than twice this limiting value .",

    "in this section we approach the brachistochrone problem from the perspective of geometrical optics by considering the path of a light ray in a medium of nonuniform index of refraction .",
    "let @xmath124 be a smooth surface in such a medium with index of refraction @xmath125 .",
    "according to fermat s principle , light propagated from source @xmath1 minimizes the total time @xmath13 of travel to destination @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath126where @xmath127 is the speed of light in a vacuum .",
    "note that when @xmath128 and @xmath129m / sec , equation ( [ optical length ] ) is equivalent to equation ( [ time ] ) . therefore , computing the path of a light ray in this medium simultaneously produces a brachistochrone solution .",
    "one can describe light rays in terms of their wavefronts , which are level surfaces of some differentiable function @xmath130 .",
    "more precisely , given a light ray @xmath131 passing through a medium with index of refraction @xmath132 , let @xmath133 be the unit tangent .",
    "then @xmath134 is determined by the eikonal equation @xmath135we can use ( [ eikonal ] ) to solve the brachistochrone problem without appealing to the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "assume that @xmath131 is constrained to some smooth surface @xmath0 with metric @xmath19 in some medium with index of refraction @xmath136 .",
    "suppose @xmath137 and that @xmath138then equation ( [ eikonal ] ) yields the differential equation @xmath139solving this separable equation for @xmath140 gives@xmath141 using equations ( [ eikonal ] ) and ( [ eikonalcurve ] ) , and letting @xmath142 and @xmath143 we have @xmath144expressing @xmath133 * *  * * in differential form gives @xmath145therefore @xmath146 by solving this equation we obtain :              the strength of theorem [ thm3 ] lies in its ability to give brachistochrone solutions in situations where classical conservation of mechanical energy does not hold .",
    "for example , if the particle s velocity is near the speed of light , to minimize the time of travel in the lab frame ( see @xcite ) we must replace the newtonian mechanical energy equation by its special relativistic counterpart @xmath154    where @xmath127 is the speed of light in a vacuum , @xmath155 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath156 ( see @xcite ) . solving ( [ relenergy ] ) for @xmath157 and then for @xmath158 gives @xmath159from equation ( [ optical length ] ) it follows that @xmath160      for example , let us again consider a particle falling in a uniform gravitational field but confined to the vertical plane @xmath161 .",
    "if the particle is falling at relativistic speeds we have @xmath162where @xmath163 is the initial height of the particle .",
    "note , in actuality the gravitational potential energy depends upon the relativistic mass and not the rest mass .",
    "therefore , the potential we have chosen corresponds to a charged particle under the influence of a uniform electric field ( see goldstein @xcite and goldstein and bender @xcite )",
    ". setting @xmath164 and applying theorem [ thm3 ] gives the solution curves @xmath43 , where @xmath165and to avoid confusion we have indicated the constant of integration by @xmath166 .",
    "figure [ relativistica ] illustrates several relativistic solution curves and classical brachistochrone solutions with @xmath167m / sec .",
    "the relativistic solutions are plotted in solid blue ; the classical solutions are plotted with dashed green lines and closely approximate relativistic solutions in this region . however , figure [ relativisticb ] illustrates situations in which such approximations are poor .",

    "thus , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are parallel and lie in the osculating plane .",
    "consequently @xmath190 and brachistochrone solutions in central force fields are planar .",
    "futhermore , since @xmath189 is parallel to the line from the particle to the origin , the osculating plane passes through the origin and contains the initial and terminal point of the curve .",
    "but , this is exactly the problem we investigated when we confined the particle to a plane .",
    "therefore , a solution curve with critical radius @xmath103 and initial point @xmath1 generates a surface of revolution whose meridians are solution curves .",
    "these remarks are summarized in our concluding theorem :    [ final thm ] if @xmath191 is a solution curve lying in a central force field with critical radius @xmath192 , then @xmath193 is identically @xmath194 and @xmath191 is a meridian of the surface of revolution generated by the curve ( [ inverse2 ] ) ."
