    "dipolar magnetic interactions couple a spin of two particles to their orbital motion in the trap @xcite .",
    "a particular example of the spin dynamics driven by the dipole - dipole interactions and coupled to the orbital motion of the entire ferromagnetic sample is known as the einstein - de haas effect ( edh ) .",
    "the effect is a macroscopic illustration of the fact that spin contributes to the total angular momentum of the system on the same footing as the orbital angular momentum .    in the original experiment @xcite a rotation of a ferromagnetic rode",
    "was observed when a relative orientation of a magnetic field ( forcing a magnetization of the sample along the field axis ) and a magnetic moment of the sample had been inverted .",
    "the rotation results form the fact that atomic spins adjust to a new orientation of the magnetic field and conservation of the @xmath0-component of the total angular momentum forces the orbital angular momentum of the sample to compensate for the change of the spin orientation .",
    "the orbital angular momentum has to depart from its initial zero value .",
    "the edh effect strongly relays on the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these interactions , due to their anisotropy do not have to conserve the orbital angular momentum . only in the presence of the dipolar interactions initially non - rotating system can start to rotate .    the edh effect was also predicted for ultra cold trapped atomic gases @xcite .",
    "here it serves as a spectacular manifestation of the dipole - dipole interactions of atomic magnetic moments .",
    "this leads to a nontrivial dynamics coupling orbital motion and atomic spin .",
    "spin dynamics due to the dipole - dipole interactions is inevitably associated with an excitation of orbital motion of an atom in the trap .",
    "the motion is quantized , there is therefore an energy gap separating initial and final states of a different magnetization .",
    "the quantization of orbital energy of atoms significantly effects a spin dynamics .",
    "this has been noticed in @xcite .",
    "two scenarios are possible depending on a ratio of the energy gap to the dipolar energy . for a relatively dense gas of polarized chromium atoms ( @xmath1 ) initially in @xmath2 state and for relatively weak harmonic traps ( @xmath3 ) , the dipolar energy can exceed the excitation gap what makes the spin dynamics possible .",
    "the atoms are transfered first to @xmath4 state and then , due to higher order processes and the contact interactions , to other magnetic components @xcite .",
    "situation is different in optical lattices or in a case of species with a small magnetic moment , such as ferromagnetic rubidium . in general",
    "if the dipolar energy is much less than the orbital excitation energy then spin dynamics is suppressed due to the energy conservation .",
    "this obstacle can be overcome .",
    "as shown in @xcite the energies of both involved states can be tuned due to a zeeman effect .",
    "the atoms prepared in @xmath5 state can be transferred to initially unoccupied @xmath4 components on the expense of the zeeman , instead of the dipolar energy . in",
    "axially symmetric traps the phase of the @xmath4 atoms wavefunction displays a characteristics vortex - like defect signifying an orbital angular momentum in a final state .",
    "this scenario has been studied in the mean field limit , for a three component rubidium spinor condensate @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that different final states , all involving vortex - like excitation , can be populated via the dipolar processes of the edh type .",
    "even highly excited trap states can be reached if energy and angular momentum conservation are met by an appropriate choice of the resonant magnetic field .",
    "energy conservation makes the weak dipolar interactions highly sensitive , selective and tunable by means of the external magnetic field .",
    "this requires however , a very high precision in control of both a value and a direction of the field applied .",
    "stabilization of the ultra weak magnetic field with precision below 1 mg is required for chromium atoms @xcite .",
    "the proposal exists suggesting that the time dependent magnetic fields might relax these constrains @xcite .",
    "the resonant character of demagnetization of initially polarized chromium atoms in an optical lattice has been demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "the edh effect was also suggested as a mechanism to create excited orbital states in the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the mechanism leads also to an interesting physics described by bose - hubbard models with two spin species occupying different wannier states .",
    "the axial symmetry of a single lattice site was assumed .",
    "this assumption seems to be quite obvious and is frequently used even in more ` exotic ' situations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to reexamine carefully the role of the harmonic approximation and show its consequences on the spin dynamics , in particular for situations when higher orbital wannier states are involved .",
    "we study elementary processes driven by the dipolar interactions with two atoms trapped in a single site of a high square optical lattice .",
    "such a scenario was considered in @xcite where it has been shown that @xmath6 efficient resonant transfer of atoms to the orbital state is possible .",
    "we show that the anharmonicity of the binding potential plays a very important role . in the context of ultracold atoms",
    "the effect of anharmonicity was discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] we define the hamiltonian of the system as well as all approximations and model parameters . then in section [ m1 ] we discuss a resonant dipolar coupling allowing for efficient spin transfer in the channel where spin projection of only one atom changes by one quantum . in section [ m2 ] we present a detailed analysis of processes when spins of both interacting atoms change by one quantum each ( the spin of the doublon changes by two quanta ) . in particular we take into account separately the effect of anharmonicity of the trapping potential and , finally , both effects of anisotropy and anharmonicity of a single site of a square optical lattice . in section",
    "[ experiment ] we compare our results with experimental data of @xcite .",
    "final remarks are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we study a simple system of two chromium @xmath7cr atoms in the @xmath8 ground state in a single site of a 2d square optical lattice created by a two pair of counter propagating laser beams of wavelength @xmath9 and momentum @xmath10 .",
    "a confinement in the z - direction is provided by a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the lattice depth is so big that we can neglect tunneling to the neighboring sites . through the paper",
    "we use the lattice units , i.e. the distance is measured in @xmath12 , all energies in units of the recoil energy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the atomic mass .",

    "we denote the unit vector in the direction of @xmath25 .",
    "spin operators are represented by the spin @xmath26 matrices . to describe the contact two - body interactions , which depend on the total spin of both atoms",
    ", we use the molecular basis in the spin space : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a two particle spin state with the total spin @xmath29 and the projection @xmath30 .",
    "the symbol @xmath31 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient and @xmath32 describes the spin state of the single atom of spin @xmath33 and its projection @xmath34 .",
    "note that due to the symmetry the total spin of the doublon , @xmath35 can take only even values , @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is : @xmath38 .",
    "the strength of the contact interactions @xmath39 is proportional to the s - wave scattering length @xmath40 in the given @xmath35-channel : @xmath41 finally the dimensionless dipole - dipole interaction strength reads @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the magnetic constant .    the physical meaning of all the terms in the hamiltonian eq.([hamiltonian ] )",
    "is straightforward .",
    "the first line corresponds to the single particle energy , @xmath44 , including both kinetic and potential energies , while the second line describes the contact interactions between particles , @xmath45 . in principle",
    ", the contact interactions can lead to a spin dynamics . in this paper",
    "we assume that initially both atoms are prepared in the ground state of the lattice site in the presence of sufficiently strong magnetic field to assure a ferromagnetic polarization of the system .",
    "the initial spin state of the doublon is @xmath46 .",
    "in such a situation the spin dynamics is driven , at least initially , by the dipolar interactions only .",
    "the external magnetic field , the third line of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , describes the linear zeeman shift of single particles energies , @xmath47 .",
    "the magnetic field allows for tuning of relative energies of the two atoms system . in this paper",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is align along the vertical @xmath0-direction , perpendicular to the 2d lattice plane .",
    "finally , the last line of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) corresponds to the energy of the dipole - dipole interactions of both atoms , @xmath48 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is the sum @xmath49 .",
    "we examine the dipolar terms in more details stressing their role on the spin dynamics .",
    "the elementary processes driven by the hamiltonian @xmath48 can be casted into three classes .",
    "collisions not changing orbital angular momentum of the doublon , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath0-component of the total orbital angular momentum of the pair .",
    "these collisions are governed by the term whose spatial dependence has the form : @xmath52 where and @xmath53 .",
    "note that this term has to be multiplied by the appropriate operator acting in the spinor space : @xmath54 the @xmath55 operator rises ( @xmath56 ) or lowers ( @xmath57 ) the magnetic quantum number of the @xmath23-th atom by one quantum .",
    "the rising and lowering operators fulfill the commutation relations for the spin , i.e @xmath58 = 2is_{z}(j)\\delta_{kj}$ ] . note , that the spinor term @xmath59 does not change the magnetization of the doublon , @xmath60 .",
    "the dipolar interaction with @xmath50 are : @xmath61 @xmath62 evidently conserves the total angular momentum along the @xmath0-axis , @xmath63 .",
    "collisions changing the @xmath0-component of the orbital angular momentum of the doublon by one quantum , @xmath64 .",
    "these processes originate from the term of the following spatial dependence : @xmath65 the upper sign corresponds to @xmath66 , while the lower sign to @xmath67 .",
    "this spatial term , @xmath68 , has to be assisted by the corresponding spinor term : @xmath69 the upper sign corresponds to processes with @xmath70 , while the lower sign to the processes with @xmath71 .",
    "the dipolar hamiltonian describing processes with @xmath72 is a product of the spatial and the spinor terms : @xmath73 and clearly @xmath63 .",
    "collisions changing the @xmath0-component of the orbital angular momentum of the doublon by two quanta , @xmath74 .",
    "these processes originate from the term of the following spatial dependence : @xmath75 which is accompanied by the spin term which changes the spin projection of the doublon by @xmath76 : @xmath77 the dipolar hamiltonian describing processes with @xmath78 is a product of the spatial and the spinor terms : @xmath79 clearly the @xmath0-component of the total angular momentum of the doublon @xmath63 is conserved .",
    "this way we decomposed the dipolar interactions into different terms : @xmath80 depending on the effect each term has on the orbital ( or equivalently the spin ) dynamics of the atom pair .",
    "to start with we assume that the external potential near the center of the site at @xmath81 can be approximated by the harmonic one .",
    "we keep only the lowest order terms in the expansion of the potential in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath82 the potential is both harmonic and axially symmetric with effective frequencies @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the aspect ratio is @xmath85 .    in the following",
    "we assume that initially both atoms are in the ground state of the external trap in the two body @xmath86 spin state , what corresponds to a fully polarized system with the both atoms in @xmath87 state .",
    "the energy of the doublon is equall to a sum of single particle and contact energies .",
    "the initial orbital state @xmath88 does not depend on the angles of the vectors @xmath89 and @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ground state of the harmonic trap . in order to stress that the axial wavefunction , @xmath93 , corresponds to a different trap frequency we separated out the axial term .    to analyze further approximations we use the realistic parameters related to experiments of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the optical lattice is created by the laser light of the wavelength of @xmath94 nm , which gives the unit of distance to be @xmath95 nm . for chromium @xmath96cr ( @xmath97 kg )",
    "the recoil energy is @xmath98 .",
    "a typical height of the potential barrier is @xmath99 what corresponds to @xmath100 for which the characteristic trap frequency is @xmath101 .",
    "we assume that the axial frequency is @xmath102 .",
    "these parameters lead to a characteristic size of the system of the order of the harmonic oscillator lengths @xmath103 and @xmath104 . with two atoms per site",
    "the atom density is about @xmath105 .",
    "corresponding contact interaction in @xmath106 channel is @xmath107 while the dipolar interaction @xmath108 .",
    "the dipolar energy is the smallest energy scale .",
    "thus we can ignore the term of dipolar interactions which does not change a total magnetization of both colliding atoms , i.e. we neglect processes with @xmath109 .",
    "the term leads only to small , negligible corrections to the contact interactions .",
    "clearly , the dipolar interactions leading to a spin dynamics assisted by an inevitable transfer of atoms to excited states of the trap are suppressed by the energy conservation because @xmath110 .",
    "the spin dynamics activates if the energy gap is compensated by the zeeman energy . to shift the relative energies of @xmath87 and @xmath111 components by the amount of @xmath112 the magnetic field equal to @xmath113 mg",
    "is needed .",
    "similarly , the zeeman energy compensating for the contact interactions is related to the magnetic field @xmath114 mg , while the dipolar energy corresponds to @xmath115 g .",
    "extremely precise control of bothl : the direction and the value of the magnetic field is necessary to control the spin dynamics in the trap .",
    "this makes a great challenge for experiments .    for the initial axially symmetric ground state",
    "@xmath116 the processes with @xmath117 and @xmath118 lead to two different orbital states of the doublon . in the lowest order of the perturbation in the dipolar interactions , the angular dependence of the two atoms relative wavefunction ( coupled to the ground state by dipolar interactions ) is determined by the angular dependence of the dipolar terms , eqs.([h1 ] ) , ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "the state excited due to @xmath119 dipolar process has energy of the order of @xmath120 , while the energy of the state reached by the system via the second channel , @xmath121 , is @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath123 is much larger than the dipolar energy then by matching the resonance condition one can activate selectively the first or the second channel ( not both of them ) .",
    "therefore we will analyze the process with @xmath119 and @xmath124 separately .",
    "our general strategy is to find the lowest energy state which is coupled by the dipole - dipole interactions to the @xmath125 state as it follows directly from the structure of the dipolar hamiltonian . at this step",
    "we determine a single particle basis which is needed to describe all relevant two - body states .",
    "then we diagonalize the full hamiltonian @xmath126 in the chosen basis and find eigenenergies and eigenvectors of the doublon . at every resonance there exists an eigenvector of the hamiltonian which is an equal - amplitude superposition of the initial and the final state .",
    "the two states forming the superposition are coupled by the dipolar interaction .",
    "alternatively , the physical insight can be gained with the help of a perturbative analysis .",
    "the state determined by the structure of the dipole - dipole term is not necessarily the eigenstate of the single particle and the contact hamiltonian .",
    "the goal is to decompose this state in the eigenstate basis of @xmath127 .",
    "a number of dipolar resonances equals to a number of different eigenstates involved in the decomposition .",
    "each component has different eigenenergy and therefore becomes resonant at a different magnetic field .    to the ` zero order ' approximation the energy of a final state - the state accessible by the dipolar interactions ",
    "is given by the sum of the single particle energies ( i.e. @xmath120 in the @xmath117 channel or @xmath128 in @xmath118 channel ) .",
    "the single particle energy gives an estimation of the resonant magnetic field .",
    "however , anharmonicity and anisotropy shift one - particle energies and the contact interactions couple them .",
    "these effects result in a splitting of energies of different components of the final states accessible via the dipole - dipole interactions i.e. in an appearance of a fine resonant structure .",
    "the strength of the resonant dipole - dipole interactions can be characterized by the self energy of the initial @xmath129 state of energy @xmath130 : @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 are ` bare ' eigenstates and eigenenergies of the two - body hamiltonian without the dipolar interactions , @xmath134 is the dipole - dipole interaction matrix element .",
    "the self energy contains a contribution from a virtual transfer of the doublon from @xmath125 to the intermediate @xmath132 state .",
    "evidently , this process contributes only at the vicinity of the resonance , where : @xmath135 the particular form of the self energy results from the fact , that at every resonance we deal with a two level system , and then the denominator in eq.([es ] ) gives the energy shift of the @xmath125 state .",
    "the spatial part of the lowest energy state of the doublon accessible via the dipole - dipole interactions in @xmath117 channel is @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , are relative coordinates of two atoms .",
    "this state is created by a two - particle operator : @xmath138 acting on the particle vacuum .",
    "the bosonic operators in the above formula create a particle in the one of the following states of the harmonic oscillator : @xmath139  in the ground state @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142  in one of the two @xmath143-shell states : @xmath144 or @xmath145 respectively , @xmath146 and @xmath147  in the @xmath148-shell states ",

    "@xmath151 is the first excited state in the axial direction .",
    "the operator @xmath152 allows for a compact representation of the ` vortex ' state with @xmath153 .",
    "the vortex is created in a relative coordinate space of the doublon . the first term in eq.([vortex1 ] )",
    "describes the state in which one atom takes one excitation quanta in the axial direction , while the second carries the vortex like excitation .",
    "the second term corresponds to a process in which one atom experiences both types of excitations while the second atom is a spectator ( at least as the spatial wavefunction is considered ) .",
    "the operator @xmath154 defines only a spatial part of @xmath155 vortex state : @xmath156 state has to be multiplied by a totally symmetric spinor component with one atom in @xmath157 and the other in @xmath158 spin states .",

    "the most important observation is that the contact interactions vanish in the @xmath161 state because its wavefunction vanishes identically if @xmath166 , i.e. @xmath167 .",
    "this state is not coupled by the contact interaction to any other state of the doublon in the trap .",
    "it is therefore the eigenstate of both the single particle and the contact hamiltonians .",
    "the dipole - dipole interactions couple efficiently the state to the initial one if energies of the involved states do match .",

    "this fact has very important consequences : @xmath174 and @xmath175 states are separable .",
    "their single particle energies are sum of @xmath143-band energies . for this reason the two components of the @xmath161 state , i.e. the one with two excited particle and the second with only one excited particle , are degenerate .",
    "anharmonicity of the lattice potential results in an equal shifts of both components of the @xmath161 state and does not lift their degeneracy .",
    "moreover , this conclusion holds even when axial symmetry of the external potential is substituted by the @xmath176 symmetry of the single site of the lattice .",
    "@xmath176 symmetry is sufficient to assure the degeneracy of @xmath177 and @xmath178 orbitals .",
    "the only effect of the lattice potential is to shift the value of the resonant magnetic field .",
    "the latter will not be true if @xmath177 and @xmath178 orbitals have different energies .",
    "in such a case the @xmath161 state will be a superposition of two eigenstates of different energies , and each component could be separately addressed in a dipolar process by an appropriate tuning of the magnetic field .",

    "note the node in @xmath179 plane what is typical for the first excited state in the axial direction .",
    "the single particle density does no resemble the structure typical for a single particle vortex state .",

    "the extremely precise control of magnetic field , probably beyond the level of experimental reach is required .",
    "the second observation is that the structure of resonances is very reach .",

    "note that both above mentioned effects act ( mainly ) in the same direction",

    "the width of an individual fine resonant feature is smaller than the width predicted in the harmonic approximation , but its magnitude remains at the same level , i.e. @xmath331 g .",
    "it is probably not possible , to resolve these fine structures experimentally . on the other hand , splitting of the singe resonant peak results in an overall broadening of the entire structure composed of several fine features .",

    "the similar agreement we get for the orientation of the magnetic field along the y - axis . in the region of large @xmath337 where highly excited states become occupied ,",
    "resonances are relatively close to each other and their number increases .",
    "different resonant structure start to overlap .",
    "therefore at higher magnetic fields , due to the fine splitting of neighboring resonances the resonant character of the process should be lost .",

    "the fitted frequencies have values within the given range of experimental uncertainties however they are different than the harmonic frequencies used in the experimental paper to get the red dashed lines in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "the positions of experimentally resolved resonances can be reproduced theoretically regardless whether anharmonicity and anisotropy of the lattice potential are taken into account or not .",
    "small uncertaintities of the lattice parameters , as well as their fluctuations , give sufficient freedom to allow for fitting positions of the resonances using both a simple harmonic theory without any two - body interactions as well as quite advanced approach accounting for all interactions and anharmonicity and anisotropy of the lattice sites .",
    "however , the overall widths of the entire fine structures can not be reproduced in the harmonic approximation .",
    "we have shown that the dipole - dipole interactions are very effective probe of the two - body states of chromium atoms in the external trapping potential .",
    "they are very sensitive to anharmonicity and symmetry of the single site .",
    "the anharmonicity of the single trap becomes very important in particular when higher wannier states with non vanishing angular momentum are concerned .",
    "the contact interactions between the degenerate states in the site lift the degeneracy and introduce a fine structure of the energy spectrum of the system .",

    "observation of spin dynamics driven by the contact interactions is a precise method of determination of contact interaction for both fermi and bose atoms @xcite .",
    "we show that spin dynamics due to dipolar interactions at the resonant magnetic field is yet another perfect tool for precise determination of the scattering lengths of involved atoms",

    "<S> anharmonicity and anisotropy of the site results in a ` fine ' structure of two body eigenenergies . </S>",
    "<S> the structure can be easily resolved by weak magnetic dipole - dipole interactions . as an example we examine the effect of anharmonicity and anisotropy of the binding potential on demagnetization processes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that weak dipolar interactions provide a perfect tool for a precision spectroscopy of the energy spectrum of the interacting few particle system . </S>"
