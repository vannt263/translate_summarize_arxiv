    "understanding the physical processes involved in the evolution of galaxies is a key goal of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "although stellar ( or halo ) mass is emerging as playing a fundamental role for galaxy evolution , environmental influences may also have an impact @xcite .",
    "this is particularly relevant in dense environments , in which galaxies may experience a wide range of externally driven processes such as mergers , tidal interactions , and gas stripping due to interactions with ambient gas .",
    "all of these processes may act to remove a substantial fraction of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , or rapidly consume or eject it through interaction  induced star formation and nuclear activity , eventually leading the galaxy to transition from blue and star - forming to red and quiescent @xcite    the relative importance of these various processes should itself be a function of environment , with mergers and tidal interactions dominating in small galaxy groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and with galaxy harassment , ram pressure stripping , and starvation ( the cut - off of the supply of cold gas for star formation from warm / hot gas in the halo ) becoming more efficient in massive clusters exhibiting high galaxy velocities @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observations do show that a lower fraction of early - type galaxies in clusters contain hot halos than their counterparts in groups @xcite , consistent with expectations of the hot halo stripping efficiency being higher in more massive systems .",
    "evidence for ram pressure stripping of the _ cold _ ism component in rich clusters is also well - established through many hi studies @xcite , suggesting that interactions between galaxies and the intracluster medium may generally be an important route to removing galactic gas in the most massive systems .",
    "the situation is less clear in smaller groups , despite these representing much more typical galaxy environments .",
    "naively , galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers should be relatively more important , given the lower galaxy velocities and intergalactic medium densities in groups .",
    "indeed , the results of @xcite and @xcite show that hot x - ray halos are retained around the majority of @xmath4 early - types in the central regions of groups , and these halos are not strongly x - ray underluminous compared to those of field galaxies . hence , removal of hot halo gas by ram pressure must be very modest in groups , at least for massive galaxies . nevertheless , numerical simulations suggest that starvation may still occur for moderate - luminosity galaxies on their first passage through even fairly small groups @xcite",
    ". viscous stripping of galactic gas through kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instabilities , the efficiency of which depends only linearly on galaxy velocity @xcite , could also play a role in groups even when brute - force ram pressure is unimportant @xcite .    for the cold gas ,",
    "a number of group galaxies show evidence for extended hi that has been stripped from their host ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and many are deficient in hi compared to similar field galaxies @xcite .",
    "some of these objects represent strong candidates for ram pressure stripping of both cold and hot ism @xcite .",
    "however , the hi properties of spirals in these environments can often be equally well explained by tidal encounters @xcite , and so it is still not fully clear which process , if any , dominates the gas removal from typical group galaxies .",
    "quantifying the importance of the various mechanisms acting on group galaxies requires detailed observations of the ism in these galaxies , both within individual groups and across systems displaying a range of global properties . to identify signatures of ongoing gas removal and how these may depend on local group environment",
    ", the ism must be probed on spatial scales of individual galaxies across the full system , with a sensitivity extending down to moderate - luminosity galaxies .",
    "exploring the role of hot gas stripping , whether induced by ram pressure or galaxy  galaxy interactions , is currently largely limited to early - type galaxies or starbursting spirals , however , since only these galaxy types generally contain x - ray detectable halo gas @xcite . in more quiescent late - type spirals , gas stripping can be far more efficiently explored using hi data . combining x - ray and hi data",
    "therefore allows one to study the ism over the full galaxy morphological range .",
    "here we combine x - ray mosaicing observations from _ chandra _ with analogous hi observations from the very large array ( vla ) to study the hot and cold ism in the nearby , x - ray bright ngc2563 group .",
    "our goal is to search for evidence of ongoing or recent gas stripping ( we here use this term to mean any externally induced removal of gas from galaxies , including via tidal stripping ) , explore possible mechanisms involved , and understand their environmental dependence . while x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite observations of this group already exist , a unique aspect of the present study is that both our x - ray and hi observations cover the entire group ( out to a projected radius of @xmath5  mpc , well beyond the estimated virial radius ) , while still benefiting from the sub - kpc spatial resolution of _ chandra _ at the target redshift",

    "uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath12 level unless otherwise specified .",
    "extensive optical spectroscopy of the ngc2563 field exists from the studies of @xcite .",
    "the field is also covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , providing images and magnitudes for all group members , and flux - calibrated spectra for most of them . from the measured redshifts",
    ", we determined group membership using the rostat package @xcite , considering all galaxies with known recessional velocities within @xmath13  km  s@xmath2 of the group mean .",
    "we then calculated the biweight estimators of velocity mean and dispersion .",
    "objects with velocities beyond @xmath14@xmath15 from the mean were discarded , and the process repeated iteratively until convergence .",
    "this technique identified 64 group members within a projected radius of @xmath16 ( @xmath17  mpc ) from the group center , including two newly discovered members from our hi observations ( see section  [ sec , hi ] ) .",

    "to do so , a radial surface brightness profile was extracted from the unsmoothed exposure - corrected _ chandra _ mosaic , centered on ngc2563 itself , and with all other bright sources masked out .",
    "the background level was estimated from the four outermost pointings , which are all centered at @xmath144@xmath145 from the x - ray peak and show consistent full - chip count rates .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted profile , shown in figure  [ fig : surfbright ] , reveals diffuse emission out to at least @xmath146 ( @xmath147  kpc in projection ) .",
    "this is a few arcminutes further than the maximum extent determined from _ rosat _ observations @xcite , and roughly corresponds to our estimate of @xmath148  kpc .",
    "modeling the profile as a sum of two @xmath149models yields @xmath150 , @xmath151  kpc , and @xmath152 , @xmath153  kpc , for the inner and outer component , respectively . with a reduced @xmath154 ,",
    "the fit is poor however , in part because the profile steepens beyond that of a @xmath149model at large radii , as also seen in other groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "the relatively high central surface brightness could potentially compromise our ability to detect individual galaxies in the group core .",
    "we have attempted to circumvent this issue by requiring a longer central _ chandra _ exposure ( 50  ks ) .",
    "in addition , the surface brightness has dropped from its central value by three orders of magnitude already at @xmath155  kpc .",
    "apart from the central galaxy , there are no optically luminous group members within the central few arcmin , so our x - ray detection limits are impacted minimally by the presence of intragroup gas .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that we find no systematic radial variation in limiting @xmath114 for the 54 group members covered by _",
    "chandra_. a detailed analysis of the intragroup medium in ngc2563 will be the subject of future work .",
    "with our hi and x - ray results extending well beyond the group virial radius , we can now explore how the ism properties of individual galaxies vary with position across the entire group , and in particular to what extent there is evidence for ongoing or recent ism stripping from the group members .",
    "the detection of x - ray tails with _ chandra _ has provided direct evidence for ram pressure stripping in both groups @xcite and clusters @xcite , and similar inferences have been made from the presence of hi tails within these systems @xcite . in x - rays , however , the detection rate of these features is generally very small ( @xmath156 ) , suggesting that strong stripping of hot ism is either very rare or proceeds very rapidly .",
    "no evidence for such activity in the form of x - ray tails is seen within ngc2563 , but this is not surprising given the low detection rate of thermal coronae within the sample .    in hi ,",
    "we identify two tails associated with the relatively isolated cgcg119 - 047 and cgcg119 - 051 , both with hi extending beyond the optical disk in the direction opposite of the group center ( figure  [ fig : sdss_hi ] ) .",
    "neither of these objects is hi deficient , so any stripping activity must have recently commenced .",
    "their respective radial velocities relative to the group mean of 200 and 320  km  s@xmath2 imply mach numbers of @xmath157 and @xmath158 for an ambient gas temperature of @xmath159  kev .",
    "although both galaxies are currently beyond the radius to which intragroup gas is detected ( @xmath160 and @xmath161  kpc ) , their hi morphologies are suggestive of ongoing ram pressure ( or viscous ) stripping .",
    "multi - wavelength observations and higher - resolution hi data would be required to confirm this ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another relatively isolated spiral , ic2293 at @xmath162  kpc , displays no hi tail but is highly deficient ( def@xmath163 ) , and is also a candidate for recent ram pressure stripping .    to test for the _ global _ importance of ram pressure stripping within the group , we next consider the radial distribution of ism detections . to put all galaxies on an equal footing",
    ", their thermal x - ray luminosities and hi masses were normalized by the galaxy @xmath164 .",
    "excluding again the central galaxy ngc2563 , evidence for hot gas is seen in only five of the group members , and figure  [ fig , lxlk ] shows that all of these reside relatively far from the group center , with four out of five located beyond the radius @xmath165  kpc to which intragroup gas is detected .",
    "in contrast , no hot ism component is found within @xmath166  kpc , where several of the optically luminous early - types reside .",
    "this includes ngc2562 at @xmath167  kpc , the closest bright galaxy to the group center , with an upper limit to @xmath114 which is an order of magnitude below the value of log@xmath168 suggested by the @xmath164@xmath114 relation for early - types in groups @xcite .    to further illustrate this point",
    ", we note that , given our x - ray detection limits ( section  [ sec , x ] ) , the @xcite relation would suggest that we should detect all early - type members brighter than log@xmath169 , irrespective of their hot gas content . in practice ,",
    "only 8/14 ( @xmath170% ) are detected , even if including ngc2563 itself and excluding sa galaxies .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig , lxlk ] shows the cumulative fraction of group members covered by _",
    "chandra _ above this @xmath164 that is x",
    "- ray detected , and the fraction that also contains evidence for a thermal component . while the former remains constant with @xmath171 , the thermal fraction drops toward the group core .",
    "although subject to large poisson errors , this result is consistent with hot ism having been stripped within the dense group core , while the more distant galaxies retaining a thermal component have yet to experience peak ram pressure during their orbit ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , galaxies with a detectable _ cold _ ism component are distributed more evenly with @xmath171 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig , mhi_lk](a ) , which compares our measured hi masses to those of similar galaxies in the field .",
    "a handful of galaxies show evidence of a significant shortfall in hi content ( i.e.  def@xmath172 ) , but the values scatter broadly around def@xmath173 and show no systematic dependence on @xmath171 .",
    "a kolmogorov test was performed to test whether the inferred deficiencies are , in fact , consistent with being drawn from a gaussian parent distribution centered at def@xmath174 with some width @xmath175 .",
    "we find that for @xmath175 in the range 0.30.5 , this probability is at least @xmath176% , regardless of whether the upper / lower limits and the highly deficient cgcg119 - 040 are included .",
    "there is thus no strong evidence from this that the large sa ",
    "sc group members are globally hi deficient .",
    "however , we present evidence in section  [ sec , glob ] that the late - type population as a whole _ is _ deficient relative to the field .    the estimated hi",
    "deficiencies depend on assumed galaxy morphology and the somewhat uncertain comparison values for field galaxies .",
    "a more robust measure of the relative hi content within the group members might be provided by @xmath177 .",
    "the dependence of this quantity on @xmath171 is shown in figure  [ fig , mhi_lk](b ) .",
    "note that at fixed @xmath171 , lower - mass galaxies would be more easily ram pressure stripped , but they are also likely to be more hi  rich to begin with .",
    "to take this into account , the galaxies were divided into three bins of comparable @xmath164 .",
    "figure  [ fig , mhi_lk](b ) confirms that even at `` fixed '' @xmath164 , there is no systematic radial dependence of hi content within the group , and hence that ram pressure stripping of cold ism is unlikely to be globally important in this system .",
    "the presence of hi tails associated with close galaxy pairs is commonly taken as a sign of tidal encounters @xcite .",
    "ngc2563 contains two galaxy pairs with clear hi extensions indicating such encounters .",
    "the most prominent of these is associated with ic2338 and ic2339 , a spiral pair separated by only @xmath178  kpc in projection and @xmath179  km  s@xmath2 in velocity .",
    "the sdss images show evidence for a stellar bridge between the galaxies , supporting a tidal origin for the hi tails .",
    "an hi extension is also connecting ugc04324 with cgcg119 - 040 ; the latter represents the most hi deficient group member ( deficient by a factor of @xmath180 ) , with all its hi associated with the h i bridge .",
    "while no corresponding stellar feature is seen in the relatively shallow sdss images , the hi morphology is strongly suggestive of a tidal encounter .    to explore whether recent removal of cold ism through tidal interactions can generally explain the observed hi deficiencies within the group , we show in figure  [ fig : hidef](a ) the hi deficiencies as a function of projected distance @xmath181 to the nearest neighbor .",
    "if excluding the closely interacting ic2338/2339 pair and the upper / lower limits , a kendall correlation test suggests an anticorrelation at the @xmath182 level . including the upper / lower limits at their nominal values strengthens the correlation significance to @xmath183 . the correlation with @xmath181 remains significant at the @xmath112 level when instead considering the normalized hi masses in figure  [ fig : hidef](b ) . while only indicative , this result is consistent with some hi having been removed in galaxy  galaxy interactions within the group .",
    "since strong tidal interactions require proximity of two galaxies in both position and velocity space , a plot of hi content against @xmath181 may be subject to large scatter due to some galaxies being close in projection only . for each galaxy , we therefore also consider the minimum value of @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the separations in projection and radial velocity between _ any _ two group members , and @xmath187  mpc and @xmath188  km  s@xmath2 are the corresponding maximum values between all galaxies in ngc2563 .",
    "strong interactions would require @xmath189 , and , if generally prominent in removing hi , would imply a correlation between hi content and @xmath190 for small values of the latter . for ngc2563",
    ", one might expect interactions to be important up to at least @xmath191 , as this would correspond to two galaxies at the same @xmath192 separated by @xmath193  kpc , or to a physically `` overlapping '' pair with @xmath194  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "as suggested by figure  [ fig : hidef](c ) and ( d ) , there is some evidence of such a correlation for @xmath195 among the individually hi detected galaxies .",
    "however , this is significant at less than @xmath112 , so we can only conclude that our results are at least consistent with some hi removal due to galaxy  galaxy interactions .",
    "repeating this analysis for the x - ray detected group members reveals no indication of a systematic trend in @xmath196 with either @xmath181 or @xmath190 .",
    "however , many of these galaxies have x - ray luminosities only slightly above our completeness limit , so deeper observations of a larger sample would be required to confirm this result within groups in general .",
    "our comprehensive vla coverage of ngc2563 enables a census of the global amount and distribution of hi in the group , and provides further evidence of recent hi mass loss from the group members .",
    "based on measurements from the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) , @xcite have quantified the typical hi mass for late - type galaxies ( sb and later ) in the general `` field '' with @xmath197 : @xmath198 ,   \\label{eq , hi}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 and @xmath200 . to compare this to results for ngc2563 , we used estimates of @xmath201 for the group members from sdss , available for all but six of the 64 members ; for those six , we assume a @xmath202band stellar mass - to - light ratio of 0.55 , which is the average for the members with both @xmath164 and @xmath201 available .",
    "equation  ( [ eq , hi ] ) would then suggest a total hi mass of the relevant group members of @xmath203 , whereas the value inferred from table  [ tab : hi ] is @xmath204 , when including the average @xmath111 upper limit of @xmath205 for the undetected members .",
    "this suggests that globally , the @xmath206 late - types in the group have suffered mild hi mass loss with respect to similar field galaxies .",
    "compared to estimates of def@xmath139 , this result may represent a more robust estimate of global hi deficiency within the group , as it includes also smaller galaxies , depends less sensitively on the inferred morphology and optical size of individual group members , and takes the dispersion seen for field galaxies into account .",
    "we also derive a total stellar mass in the group of @xmath207 for all the 64 spectroscopically identified members , and a corresponding total range of @xmath208 .",
    "this implies @xmath2090.062 for the full group ( down to our 98% spectroscopic completeness limit of @xmath210 ) , under the plausible assumption that our vla observations are not missing any large - scale diffuse hi .",
    "future comparison of this result for an x - ray bright group to other groups and clusters could provide further information on the nature of gas removal in these environments .    on the largest scales ,",
    "the distribution of hi  detected galaxies in figure  [ fig , hi_mosaic ] reveals a peculiar lopsidedness , with 16 of the 20 detections occurring on the western side of the group .",
    "this is not simply due to asymmetric spatial vla coverage , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : hichannel ] , nor to a larger fraction of hi deficient galaxies in the east .",
    "the wide velocity coverage of our vla data ( @xmath211 ) further renders it unlikely that a significant fraction of potential group members have been missed on the eastern side of the system .",
    "the lopsided hi distribution thus reflects a real asymmetry in the distribution of late - type members , with nearly all the large spirals located in the western half of the group .",
    "the origin of this asymmetry remains unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the western spirals are part of an infalling subgroup , but echoing an earlier conclusion by @xcite , we find no evidence for kinematic substructure in the group using the technique pioneered by @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario is that galaxy morphologies have been modified by strong interactions with a similarly asymmetric intragroup medium .",
    "this can be ruled out , however , because the intragroup gas distribution in ngc2563 appears fairly symmetric on large scales and , if anything , seems more strongly extended to the west ( see figure  [ fig : mosaic ] and @xcite ) .",
    "finally , exploiting the extensive sdss coverage in this field , we have also examined the overall galaxy distribution within a projected distance of @xmath212  mpc of the group center , and find no evidence for a general large - scale enhancement in galaxy density on the western side of the group .",
    "further studies of other groups on very large scales may help establish how common such morphological segregations are in these systems .",
    "our extensive _",
    "chandra _ and vla coverage of the ngc2563 galaxy group has enabled us to probe both the hot and cold ism within a nearby group out to @xmath213 times the estimated virial radius .",
    "the main aim has been to characterize the evidence for galactic gas removal in this system , and understand the mechanisms involved .",
    "although the limited number of galaxies preclude strong conclusions based on a single group , our results suggest that both hot and cold gas have been stripped from some of the group members , and that both ram pressure stripping and gas removal via galaxy  galaxy interactions are all occurring simultaneously within this one system .",
    "this is based on the following evidence :    \\(i ) the thermal x - ray deficiency of optically luminous early - type galaxies in the group core suggests recent ram pressure stripping of their hot gas .",
    "the central group galaxy aside , no hot ism is detected within @xmath166  kpc from the group core , whereas four out of the five non - central galaxies with such a component reside beyond the radius to which intragroup gas is detected .",
    "the thermal luminosity of the bright early - type closest to the group core ( ngc2562 ) is at least an order of magnitude below that expected for typical group galaxies of the relevant @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) comparison of the hi content of the late - type group members to that of similar galaxies in the field suggests that the former are , on average , mildly deficient in hi .",
    "this points to one or more mechanisms removing cold ism within the group .",
    "\\(iii ) ram pressure ( or viscous ) stripping of cold gas is suspected in a few cases .",
    "the hi data reveal one relatively isolated spiral ( ic2293 ) which is hi deficient by more than a factor of three .",
    "another two such spirals show hi morphologies suggestive of an ongoing ram pressure interaction , with hi tails pointing away from the group core ( cgcg119 - 047 and 119 - 051 in figure  [ fig : sdss_hi ] )",
    ". however , these are not ( yet ) hi deficient by the usual definition , indicating that significant interactions with the intragroup medium may have only recently commenced .",
    "\\(iv ) ongoing galaxy  galaxy interactions removing hi are also strongly suggested in at least two cases .",
    "the two most prominent h i tails / extensions in the group occur within close galaxy pairs , and the most hi deficient group member ( cgcg119 - 040 , deficient by a factor of @xmath180 ) is a member of one of these .",
    "suggestive evidence is further seen for galaxies with close neighbors in position  velocity space to show relatively low hi content , consistent with tidal stripping of hi .",
    "the inference that ram pressure stripping of hot galactic gas may have occurred in the central group regions would be in line with other _",
    "chandra _ studies of group and cluster galaxies @xcite , and with simulations which suggest that such stripping can be efficient even in small galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a large fraction of early - type galaxies generally do retain halos even in x - ray bright groups , including some in ngc2563 , and that such halos are not generally underluminous compared to those of galaxies in the field @xcite . despite the detection of a hot intragroup medium within ngc2563 out to @xmath214 , there is also no global evidence for ram pressure stripping of the _ cold _ ism within the group .",
    "specifically , no radial trends are seen in the stellar mass  normalized hi content among the 20 hi detected group members .    the indicative result that ram pressure may affect",
    "only the hot ism in typical group galaxies is consistent with existing numerical studies @xcite .",
    "galaxy interactions remain the main candidate for removing cold ism within ngc2563 and explaining the global hi deficiency inferred for the late - type group members .",
    "other studies have also implied that tidal encounters have an important impact on the hi properties of galaxies in groups @xcite .",
    "in addition , such encounters may work to enhance the susceptibility of a galaxy to ram pressure stripping , by perturbing the distribution of the cold gas @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , despite the detection of two new group members from our optically blind hi search , we find no evidence within the ngc2563 group for isolated , optically dark h i clouds that might represent previously removed material .    given the small number of luminous galaxies in a single group , similar studies of a larger group sample will be required to better understand how the group environment impacts galaxy evolution . for example , we note that the inferred hi - to - stellar mass ratio of @xmath215 inferred for this x - ray bright group may provide a useful benchmark for the hi content of dynamically evolved groups .",
    "future comparison of this result to those of x - ray faint systems , richer clusters , and groups at higher redshift ( of which the upcoming square kilometre array should detect many thousands ) could further improve our understanding of the nature and epoch of gas removal in dense environments .",
    "such studies would also help to address the commonality of the highly lopsided distribution of hi seen in ngc2563 , which reflects a puzzling galaxy morphological segregation within the group .",

    "<S> chandra _ and very large array mosaic observations of the hot and cold interstellar medium within the members of the nearby , x - ray bright ngc2563 group , a prime target for studies of the role of gas stripping and interactions in relatively small host halos . </S>",
    "<S> our observations cover nearly all group members within a projected radius of 1.15  mpc ( @xmath0 ) of the group center , down to a limiting x - ray luminosity and hi mass of @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray data are consistent with efficient ram pressure stripping of the hot gas halos of early - type galaxies near the group core , but no x - ray tails are seen and the limited statistics preclude strong conclusions . the hi results suggest moderate hi mass loss from the group members when compared to similar field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> six of the 20 hi  detected group members show hi evidence of ongoing interactions with other galaxies or with the intragroup medium . </S>",
    "<S> suggestive evidence is further seen for galaxies with close neighbors in position  velocity space to show relatively low hi content , consistent with tidal removal of hi . </S>",
    "<S> the results thus indicate removal of both hot and cold gas from the group members via a combination of ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that 16 of the 20 hi detections occur on one side of the group , reflecting an unusual morphological segregation whose origin remains unclear . </S>"
