    "<S> assuming the majorana nature of massive neutrinos , we generalize the friedberg - lee neutrino mass model to include cp violation in the neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 . the most general case with all the free parameters of @xmath0 being </S>",
    "<S> complex is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a favorable neutrino mixing pattern ( with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) can naturally be derived from @xmath0 , if it has an approximate or softly - broken @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out a different way to obtain the nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern with @xmath7 and non - vanishing majorana phases .    recently </S>",
    "<S> , a novel neutrino mass model has been proposed by friedberg and lee ( fl).@xcite the neutrino mass operator in the fl model is simply given by @xmath8 where the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are all assumed to be _ real _ , and the charged - lepton mass matrix is taken to be diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> a salient feature of @xmath13 is its partial gauge - like symmetry ; i.e. , its @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms are invariant under the transformation @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) with @xmath16 being a space - time independent constant element of the grassmann algebra.@xcite from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , one can directly write down the neutrino mass matrix : @xmath17 two interesting features can be inferred from the diagonalization of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> first , the neutrino mass matrix takes a magic form,@xcite in which the sums of rows and columns are all equal to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary matrix used to diagonalize @xmath0 must have one eigenvector with three equal components @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> second , when @xmath19 holds , it is very easy to check that the neutrino mass operator @xmath13 has the exact @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath13 is invariant under the exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath6 indices).@xcite in addition , one may consider to remove one degree of freedom from @xmath13 or @xmath0 ( for instance , by setting @xmath20).@xcite    to include cp or t violation into the fl model , one may insert the phase factors @xmath21 into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) by replacing the term @xmath22 with the term @xmath23.@xcite the resultant neutrino mass matrix is no longer symmetric , hence it describes dirac neutrinos instead of majorana neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> however , in most of the realistic models , the majorana nature is preferable to the dirac nature of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in this work , we aim to generalize the fl model to include cp and t violation for massive majorana neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start from the generic analysis with all the parameters of @xmath0 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) being complex . for majorana neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 is symmetric and can be diagonalized by the transformation @xmath24 , in which @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) stand for the neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> after a straightforward calculation , the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath27 turns out to be @xmath28 where the explicit expressions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 and the definitions of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be found in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , three mass eigenvalues of @xmath0 and two majorana phases of @xmath27 are found to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 again , the expressions of @xmath37 have also been listed in ref . .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to consider two special but interesting scenarios of the generalized fl model and explore their respective consequences on three neutrino mixing angles and three cp - violating phases .    </S>",
    "<S> scenario ( a ) : @xmath9 and @xmath12 are real , and @xmath38 are complex . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry of @xmath0 is softly broken in this case , because @xmath39 holds . by using the generic results given in eqs . </S>",

    "<S> parametrization,@xcite we immediately obtain @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic jarlskog parameter @xmath47 , which is a rephasing - invariant measure of cp violation in neutrino oscillations,@xcite reads @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath49 holds , the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern ( with @xmath50 or @xmath51 , @xmath2 and @xmath52)@xcite will be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the soft breaking of @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry leads to both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , but it does not affect the favorable result @xmath2 given by the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern . on the other hand , @xmath55 is an excellent approximation , since @xmath29 must be small to maintain the smallness of @xmath56 . in view of @xmath57,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to measure @xmath60 in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino masses in scenario ( a ) rely on four real model parameters @xmath12 , @xmath9 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is easy to fit the neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath63 and @xmath64.@xcite such a fit should not involve any fine - tuning , because ( a ) the number of free parameters is larger than the number of constraint conditions and ( b ) three neutrino masses have very weak correlation with three mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed numerical analysis can be found in ref . , and a remarkable feature is that only the normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath65 ) is allowed in this scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> scenario ( b ) : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are all real , but @xmath12 is complex . by using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3)-(6 ) , we obtain @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ^ 2 + \\left [ { \\rm i m } \\left </S>",

    "<S> two majorana phases @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given by @xmath71 although @xmath69 and @xmath70 have nothing to do with the behaviors of neutrino oscillations , they may significantly affect the neutrinoless double - beta decay.@xcite comparing our formulae with the standard parametrization , we arrive at @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 together with @xmath7 for the dirac phase of cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath75 and @xmath56 in this scenario are the same as those obtained in scenario ( a ) , but the jarlskog parameter @xmath47 is now vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> because of the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking , @xmath76 may somehow deviate from the favorable value @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath57 , @xmath76 is allowed to vary in the range @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino masses depend on five real model parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is sufficient freedom to fit two observed neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath82 and @xmath83 . our careful numerical analysis , which has been done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , shows that both normal ( @xmath65 ) and inverted ( @xmath84 ) neutrino mass hierarchies are allowed , and the majorana phases ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) are less restricted in scenario ( b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although our discussions about the generalized fl model are restricted to low - energy scales , it can certainly be extended to a superhigh - energy scale ( e.g. , the gut scale or the seesaw scale ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one should take into account the radiative corrections to both neutrino masses and flavor mixing parameters when they run from the high scale to the electroweak scale.@xcite    we conclude that the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry and its slight breaking are useful and suggestive for model building . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that a stringent test of the generalized fl model , in particular its two simple and instructive scenarios , can be achieved in the near future from the neutrino oscillation and neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments . </S>"
