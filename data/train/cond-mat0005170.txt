    "quantum phase transitions are sudden changes in the nature of the ground state of a physical system , when some dynamical parameter reaches a critical value .",
    "their theoretical mark of distinction is that they occur even when the temperature is strictly zero ( as only theory can make it ) , so that the sampling of phase space , responsible for finding the new optimal configuration , is entirely by quantum , not thermal , fluctuations .",
    "the main interest in these transitions is that they are triggered by quantum many - body effects , so they indicate the appearance of new ` states of matter ' built by microscopic interactions .",
    "the processes involved in them have been well understood in many cases where a weak - coupling limit is appropriate , the most famous of which is bcs superconductivity . in purely electronic systems in the strong - coupling limit ,",
    "to which the subsequent discussion is limited , apart from numerical simulations  @xcite and one - dimensional systems  @xcite , the study of phase transitions has most often resorted to oblique approaches : drawing analogies with the one - dimensional case  @xcite , making inferences from sophisticated weak - coupling studies  @xcite , or solving essentially one - body problems , with some constraint added , which supposedly accounts for the effects of strong correlations  @xcite .",
    "the present work is of this last kind .",
    "it is motivated by the strange ` normal state ' of hole - doped high - temperature superconductors , which conduct electricity in some way which has so far defied considerable efforts at explanation .",
    "these have revolved around the question , whether the conducting state can be understood by modifying a fermi liquid picture  @xcite , or some radically different zeroth - order approximation , involving perhaps spin - charge separation  @xcite , is needed . in the materials themselves , a wide range of measurements , from conductivity  @xcite to photoemission  @xcite ,",
    "indicate a crossover , from a strange to an apparently fermi - liquid electron system , as the doping increases from underdoped to overdoped .",
    "since the present model is one - body , it is unable to address these ` deep ' issues directly , being , in addition , tied to a fermi liquid language by a formal construction .",
    "however , it can still distinguish between a liquid and a gas .",
    "it turns out that the mott - hubbard transition in the model is a liquid - to - gas transition in the direction of _ increasing _ doping .",
    "the system is a liquid in the lower hubbard band , and a gas in the in - gap band .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , because the in - gap band corresponds to a more crowded real space .",
    "it is due to the transition being provoked by hopping fluctuations , which find the spatially less ordered ` gas ' beneficial for delocalization , precisely when crowding is high .",
    "the remainder of the article is a brief elaboration of these points . in particular",
    ", it will be shown that the transition is a quantum one , and can be triggered by increasing the hopping overlap at zero temperature , when the doping is fixed in a certain narrow range below half - filling .",
    "the model is the same as described previously  @xcite . it is a random tiling of the copper - oxide planes by cuo@xmath0 ` molecules ' consisting of a copper site connected with the neighboring oxygens by a tight - binding overlap @xmath2 .",
    "the only other parameter is the copper - oxygen energy splitting , @xmath4 in the hole picture .",
    "only up - spins actually hop over these molecules , while the presence of the down - spins is expressed by some given concentration of forbidden sites , i.e. the absence of molecules over which the up - spins can hop .",
    "hubbard s repulsion @xmath5 is thus effectively infinite , while hopping is ` projected ' : the presence of a down - spin on a site cancels the up - spin hopping to that site .",
    "the fact that down - electrons are really not heavier than the others is simulated by annealing , so that the phase space accessible to mobile electrons includes all possible positions of the static ones , in contrast to the ` quenched ' approach , which would be appropriate for real heavy impurities .",
    "the resulting translational invariance enables a @xmath6-space formulation which respects the pauli principle , so the model effectively interpolates between quantum order in inverse space at low temperature , and classical disorder in real space at high temperature .",
    "which temperature is ` low ' is determined by the width @xmath7 of the in - gap band , created by the transition : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the distance from the oxygen band to the middle of the in - gap band .",
    "( 11.52,7.2 ) ( 0,0 )    figure [ prijelaz ] shows the mott - hubbard transition in the model , as a function of concentration @xmath10 and hopping overlap @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the simple ` kinematical ' expectation that it would occur at half - filling for all @xmath2 is not fulfilled . instead ,",
    "the greater @xmath2 is , the sooner will the transition occur in doping ; however , there is also a saturation effect , so even a very large @xmath2 will not pull the transition below @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath12 is small , it occurs near half - filling .",
    "it can be shown that at zero temperature , the transition will occur at the doping value @xmath13f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_- ) , \\label{crit}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , and the fermi function is in terms of the effective bonding band dispersion @xmath15 of the mobile , up - spins .",
    "( the chemical potential @xmath16 refers to them , @xmath17 . )",
    "since the band is being filled from the edge of the zone , the factor in brackets is negative , moving the transition from the classical line @xmath18 to smaller values , corresponding to electron doping . if @xmath2 were so large that @xmath19 , the correction would be @xmath20 at half - filling , accounting for the saturation in figure [ prijelaz ]",
    ".    equation ( [ crit ] ) shows the transition to be controlled by the hopping overlap @xmath2 .",
    "it is a quantum phase transition , with ( [ crit ] ) giving the critical line in the plane of @xmath2 and doping , at zero temperature .",
    "the physical origin of equation ( [ crit ] ) is in a basic assumption of the model , that the presence of forbidden sites influences the effective dispersion of the mobile spins @xmath15 through a bulk parameter , the chemical potential @xmath21 of the static down - spins , schematically : @xmath22\\cdot z_\\nu . \\label{fact}\\ ] ] this is , essentially , a thermodynamical assumption : the energy levels of mobile up - spins depend on @xmath21 as a ` mechanical ' measure of their available phase space",
    ". equation ( [ fact ] ) implies a contribution from @xmath23 to the counting of down - spins , which then produces a transition in the middle of the band ; though not precisely in the middle , as shown above .",
    "the reason for this can be understood along the same lines : the band _ narrows _ as the chemical potential of down - spins increases , so that @xmath24 can not be the same for all states in the band .",
    "when it is integrated over the brillouin zone , it gives the correction in equation ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "the point of all this is that as soon as one imagines something like ( [ fact ] ) is possible , the transition will occur at an incommensurate filling ; this is a very robust consequence of the assumption ( [ fact ] ) , not the effect of some detail . as seen from equation ( [ crit ] ) , neglecting the correction would be like taking @xmath25 , true at half - filling , to be true for all states .",
    "the present model , by contrast , takes the pauli principle for the mobile electrons into account exactly .",
    "the very existence of a quantum dispersion pushes the transition away from half - filling .",
    "[ to derive equation ( [ crit ] ) , one simply adds the saddle - point equations @xmath26 inserting at the same time the particular limit @xmath27 , which corresponds to their solution at the critical line and @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is the bare energy of the oxygen level . ]",
    "the model transition from the lower hubbard to the in - gap band is like from a liquid to a gas .",
    "it has been noticed previously  @xcite that the entropy of mobile spins suffers a discontinuous jump at the transition , and that the contribution of the interaction to the entropy abruptly rises from a fairly large negative value ( @xmath30  k@xmath31 per site ) to zero .",
    "these are characteristics of a first - order liquid - gas transition . in words ,",
    "as soon as the interaction has created the in - gap band , its effects are absorbed into the one - particle properties of the band states .",
    "( 11.18,9.64 ) ( 0,0 )    indications to the same effect can be obtained studying the bulk effective mass , or , technically , the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath32 . first , in non - interacting band electrons , @xmath33 obeys a simple scaling relationship , when the overlap @xmath2 is changed : @xmath34 this is a ` law of corresponding states ' for the fermi gas : the system with an overlap reduced to @xmath35 is the same as the ` old ' system at a lower temperature and higher effective mass ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "figure [ gamma ] shows that this is obeyed to very high precision for states in the in - gap band",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the renormalizations involved are quantitatively much larger than in the non - interacting case .",
    "for instance , changing @xmath2 from 1  ev to 0.2  ev involves a factor @xmath37 of only about 10 for non - interacting electrons , while the corresponding factor in figure [ gamma ] is over 200 .",
    "by contrast , in the lower hubbard band , the scaling ( [ eqsca ] ) is not obeyed .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of the interaction contribution to the entropy : the system being a liquid there , interactions spoil the scaling which depends only on the kinetic parameter @xmath2 .",
    "a further characteristic of a first - order transition is that the effective mass does not diverge . the same behavior as in figure [ gamma ]",
    "is also observed for fillings in the immediate vicinity of the transition .",
    "the bulk mass passes through a maximum and saturates , even though for the small value @xmath38  ev shown in the figure , this only happens below @xmath39  k. the two minima in the free energy , corresponding to the lower hubbard band and in - gap band , exchange place without the fluctuations around either diverging .",
    "the quantum transition described here differs from usual model descriptions of the mott - hubbard transition , in that it occurs at an incommensurate filling .",
    "this is disconcerting , since the classical ` counting ' prediction for the transition point is upheld by particle - hole symmetry .",
    "however , this symmetry is broken by forbidding fluctuations onto a doubly occupied site . in the one - band model , this results in the disappearance of phase space precisely at half - filling . in the three - band model",
    ", there is still phase space associated with the oxygen sites , so there are quantum fluctuations left , even if the doubly occupied site is treated classically .",
    "this is the regime of the present model .",
    "the quantum fluctuations are due to projected hopping , which plays the role of an interaction .",
    "it creates the in - gap band , which explains why it corresponds to a ` gas ' phase : this is where hopping has won !",
    "once particle - hole symmetry is broken , the criterion for the transition becomes quantitative , as expressed by equation ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "such a situation is generic for a phase transition , whose position is usually determined by a competition of energy scales , not arguments of symmetry .",
    "magnetic interactions , for instance , also cause a transition in some incommensurate range , around half - filling . in their absence , no long - range order is expected in the preset model , although a significant tendency to order may be inferred from the interaction entropy in the lower hubbard band , as the transition is approached  @xcite .",
    "charge correlations prefer the less ordered ` gas ' phase when space becomes crowded , and so their effect is opposite to that of magnetic interactions .",
    "the in - gap states are called a gas because , as discussed in section [ trans ] , they are characterized by an absence of residual interactions .",
    "as opposed to these qualitative considerations , their quantitative parameters may indicate states very close to localization , as shown in figure  [ gamma ] .",
    "an interpretation of the gas in terms of the underlying fermions is not possible directly within the model , because it uses a trick to count the fermion phase space correctly : the @xmath6-space states which diagonalize the grand potential are based on the translational invariance of the ensemble as a whole , not of an individual member of it .",
    "the states in a _ given _ sample could be different from a fermi liquid .",
    "the ` gas ' probably means that annealment by quantum fluctuations has moved the forbidden sites out of the way , for hopping to occur down ( quantum ) percolation channels , which extend across the system , giving rise to some effective band - width .",
    "this gives an appealing picture , how mean free paths can be shorter than the lattice spacing : at low @xmath12 , few of these channels remain open at any finite temperature , because hopping is then inefficient against the even larger entropy associated with complete site disorder .",
    "simulations should help confirm this interpretation , but very steep increases of the entropy with temperature have been obtained  @xcite in the model at @xmath40 .    finally , one may wonder how much of this picture would remain , if both kinds of electrons were allowed to hop .",
    "it is easy to imagine some kind of mutual compromise along the lines sketched above , but the physical question is , would such a network survive on time scales much longer than those associated with the traversal of a single electron across the crystal .",
    "if so , this would give a picture of conduction in real space , in which a given electron moves as a single particle , but all electrons of one spin present themselves as a quasi - static collective ( the network ) to those of the other spin .",
    "the present model is essentially a realization ` by hand ' of this intriguing symmetry breaking , first proposed by gutzwiller for the hubbard model : that one kind of spin sees the other ` as if occupying a band of width zero '  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the model construction implies a direct experimental consequence of this assumption .",
    "namely , the chemical potential of these ` other ' spins , the @xmath21 in equation ( [ fact ] ) , is independent of doping throughout the in - gap band ( because they are dispersionless ) , so the dispersion @xmath41 should not vary with doping either .",
    "experimentally , positions of dispersive peaks along typical cuts in the brillouin zone vary by a rough , but still unexpectedly uniform , 0.2  ev in a wide class of materials  @xcite , from optimally doped to insulators  @xcite , but again , this changes for overdoping  @xcite .    to conclude , a model quantum phase transition has been described , caused by hopping fluctuations in the presence of a classical on - site repulsion .",
    "it is analogous to a liquid - gas transition , and is not associated with a divergence of the effective mass , even though it may appear otherwise for all but the lowest temperatures .",
