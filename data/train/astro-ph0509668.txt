    "accretion disks a very commonly encountered in the astrophysical context . in the case where the accreting star is a compact object , they offer a very efficient way to release the gravitational energy into x - ray emission . however the process of release of angular momentum leading to the accretion is still poorly understood .",
    "the discovery of the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations  ( khz - qpos ) in the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in  1996 offers a new tool for the diagnostic of the physics in the innermost part of an accretion disk and therefore in a strong gravitational field .    to date",
    ", quasi - periodic oscillations have been observed in about twenty lmxbs sources containing an accreting neutron star . among these systems ,",
    "the high - frequency qpos ( khz - qpos ) which mainly show up by pairs , possess strong similarities in their frequencies , ranging from  300  hz to about  1300  hz , and in their shape  ( see van der klis  @xcite for a review ) .    since this first discovery several models have been proposed to explain the khz - qpos phenomenon observed in lmxbs .",
    "a beat - frequency model was introduced to explain the commensurability between the twin khz - qpos frequency difference and the neutron star rotation .",
    "this interaction between the orbital motion and the star rotation happens at some preferred radius .",
    "alpar & shaham ( @xcite ) and shaham  ( @xcite ) proposed the magnetospheric radius to be the preferred radius leading to the magnetospheric beat - frequency model .",
    "the sonic - point beat - frequency model was suggested by miller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the preferred radius is the point where the radial inflow becomes supersonic .",
    "but soon after , some new observations on scorpius  x-1 showed that the frequency difference is not constant  ( van der klis et al .",
    "this was then confirmed in other lmxbs like 4u  1636 - 53 ( jonker et al .",
    "the sonic - point beat frequency model was then modified to take into account this new fact  ( lamb & miller  @xcite ) .",
    "the relativistic precession model introduced by stella & vietri ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) makes use of the motion of a single particle in the kerr - spacetime . in this model , the khz - qpos frequency difference is related to the relativistic periastron precession of weakly elliptic orbits while the low - frequencies qpos are interpreted as a consequence of the lense - thirring precession .",
    "markovic & lamb ( @xcite ) have also suggested this precession in addition to some radiation warping torque which could explain the low frequency qpos .",
    "more promisingly , abramowicz & kluniak  ( @xcite ) introduced a resonance between orbital and epicyclic motion that can account for the 3:2 ratio around kerr black holes leading to an estimate of their mass and spin .",
    "indeed , for black hole candidates the 3:2 ratio was first noticed by abramowicz & kluniak ( @xcite ) who also recognized and stressed its importance .",
    "abramowicz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the non - linear resonance for the geodesic motion of a test particle can lead to the 3:2 ratio for the two main resonances .",
    "now the 3:2 ratio of black hole qpos frequencies is well established ( mcclintock & remillard , @xcite ) .",
    "kluniak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the twin khz - qpos can be explained by a non linear resonance in the epicyclic motion of the accretion disk .",
    "the idea that a resonance in modes of accretion disk oscillations may be excited by a coupling to the neutron star spin is discussed by kluniak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . numerical simulations in which the disk was disturbed by an external periodic field confirmed this point of view ( lee et al .",
    "rebusco  ( @xcite ) developed the analytical treatment of these oscillations .",
    "more recently , trk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) applied this resonance to determine the spin of some microquasars .",
    "in other models , the qpos are identified with gravity or pressure oscillation modes in the accretion disk ( titarchuk et al .",
    "@xcite , wagoner et al .",
    "rezzolla et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that the high frequency qpos in black hole binaries are related to p - mode oscillations in a non keplerian torus .",
    "nevertheless , the propagation of the emitted photons in curved spacetime can also produce some intrinsic peaks in the fourier spectrum of the light curves ( schnittman & bertschinger @xcite ) .",
    "bursa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested a gravitational lens effect exerting a modulation of the flux intensity induced by the vertical oscillations of the disk while simultaneously oscillating radially .",
    "the propagation in the curved spacetime reproduces also the 3:2 ratio observed in black hole binaries as shown by schnittman & rezzolla ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations in accretion disks orbiting around white dwarfs , neutron stars or black holes have shown a strong correlation between their low and high frequencies qpos ( mauche  @xcite , psaltis et al .",
    "the relation is found to be the same for any kind of compact object .",
    "this correlation has been explained in terms of the centrifugal barrier model of titarchuk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the very good agreement in the correlation of these low and high frequencies qpos spanned over more than 6  order of magnitude leads us to the conclusion that the physical mechanism responsible for the oscillations should be the same for the neutron star systems , the black hole candidates and the cataclysmic variables ( warner et al .",
    "indeed , the presence or the absence of a solid surface , a magnetic field or an event horizon play no relevant role in the production of the x - ray variability  ( wijnands  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we propose a new resonance mechanism related to the evolution of the accretion disk in a non axisymmetric rotating gravitational field .",
    "this kind of forced response induced in the disk has been mostly studied in the protoplanetary system or to explain rings around some planets like saturn . in the former case ,",
    "a planet evolving within the disk is responsible for the gravitational perturbation and should be treated in the framework of hydrodynamical equations ( tanaka  @xcite ) . in binary systems ,",
    "the companion exerts some torque on the accretion disk due to tidal forces .",
    "the spiral pattern excited at the lindblad resonance propagates down to the inner boundary of the disk ( papaloizou & pringle @xcite , blondin @xcite ) .",
    "whereas in the later case , this role is devoted to the satellite and is well described ( at least in first approximation ) by non collisional equations of motion as for instance for the famous saturn rings ( lissauer & cuzzi @xcite ) .",
    "this simplified study helps to understand the physics of the resonance without any complication introduced by the gaseous pressure ( or the radiation pressure ) acting as a restoring force .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equinit ] , we describe the initial stationary state of the accretion disk and the nature of the gravitational potential perturbation , starting with a quadrupolar field to easily bring out the physics of the resonances and , then , generalizing to a gravitational field possessing several azimuthal modes in his fourier transform . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anallin ] , the governing equation for the linear regime of the lagrangian displacement is derived .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : disquemince ] , we show that the disk resonates due to the non axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential .",
    "we study in detail the linear response of a thin accretion disk which suffers no warping .",
    "then a simplified three dimensional analysis is carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec : analinsimp ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , in order to study the evolution of the resonances on a longer timescale and in order to take into account all the non - linearities , we perform 2d numerical simulations by using a pseudo - spectral method which is compared to the linear results .",
    "first we apply this code to an accretion disk evolving in a newtonian potential .",
    "the results are then extended to the calculation of a disk orbiting around a kerr black hole by introducing a specific pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "we briefly discuss the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the conclusions of this work and the possible generalization are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the initial hydrodynamical stationary configuration of the accretion disk evolving in a perfectly spherically symmetric gravitational potential created by the compact object .",
    "we then give some justifications for the origin of the gravitational perturbation .      in the equilibrium state ,",
    "the disk possesses a stationary axisymmetric configuration evolving in a spherically symmetric gravitational field generated by the central star . by axisymmetric we mean that every field is invariant under rotation along the symmetry axis @xmath0 .",
    "the disk inner and outer edges are labeled by  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 respectively .",
    "all quantities possess only a  @xmath3 dependence such that density  @xmath4 , pressure  @xmath5 and velocity  @xmath6 are given by  : @xmath7 we can for instance assume that the disk is locally in isothermal equilibrium and therefore uncouple the vertical @xmath8-structure from the radial @xmath9-structure ( pringle @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational attraction from the compact object is balanced by the centrifugal force and the pressure gradient in the radial direction while in the vertical direction we simply have the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this gives  : @xmath10 we need only to prescribe the initial density in the disk .",
    "assuming a thin accretion disk , the gradient pressure will be negligible so that the motion remains close to the keplerian rotation .",
    "when a rotating asymmetric component is added to the gravitational field , the equilibrium state will be disturbed and evolves to a new configuration where some resonances arise on some preferred radii which will be determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : anallin ] .      in the case of a rotating neutron star or white dwarf",
    ", the centrifugal force induces a deformation of its shape and breaks the spherical symmetry .",
    "the magnitude of this deformation depends on the equation of state adopted for the star .",
    "another reason for assuming a non spherical star is given by the deformation due to the strong magnetic stress existing in the neutron star s interior  ( bonazzola & gourgoulhon  @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is very small with an ellipticity of the order of  @xmath11 to  @xmath12 .",
    "if the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotation axis of the star , the accretion disk will feel an asymmetric gravitational field rotating at the same speed as the compact object .",
    "we assume that the star is a perfect source of energy which means that its spin rate remains constant in time . to this approximation ,",
    "energy and angular momentum exchanges between star and disk has no influence on the compact object .",
    "this assumption will be used throughout the paper .",
    "we insist on the fact that the goal of this paper is not to give an accurate description of the origin and the shape of the deformation but only to study the consequences of such a perturbation on the evolution of the accretion disk .",
    "let s have a look on the shape of the potential induced by this deformation of the stellar crust . to the lowest order , in an appropriate coordinate frame attached to the star ,",
    "the first contribution is quadrupolar , there is no dipolar component .",
    "the tensor of the quadrupolar moment  @xmath13 can be reduced to a traceless diagonal tensor in an appropriate coordinate system  @xmath14 corresponding to the principal axis of the ellipsoid formed by the star . in this particular coordinate frame we have @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the perturbed newtonian potential expressed in cylindrical coordinates  @xmath18 is then given by  : @xmath19 this expression is only valid in the frame corotating with the star .",
    "returning back to an inertial frame , i.e. the observer frame , energy and angular momentum are no longer conserved .",
    "indeed , part of the rotational energy of the star will be injected in the motion of the accretion disk .",
    "this is the source of energy for the resonance to be maintained .",
    "the physical relevant quantity is the perturbation in the gravitational field caused by the quadrupolar moment and in the frame corotating with the star , these components are given by  : @xmath20 to get the expression valid for a distant observer , at rest , we need to replace  @xmath21 by  @xmath22 where we have introduced the rotation rate of the star by  @xmath23 .",
    "this potential seems far from any realistic perturbation around a neutron star or a white dwarf .",
    "nevertheless , it offers a well understandable insight into the resonances mechanisms by selecting solely a particular azimuthal mode  @xmath24 , namely the  @xmath25 quadrupolar case here .",
    "this kind of gravitational perturbation is easily extended to more general shapes including any other mode  @xmath24 . the way to introduce",
    "naturally such a structure is explained in the next subsection .",
    "the potential described above is a simple estimate of a quadrupolar distortion induced by the rotation of the star .",
    "it introduce only one azimuthal mode , allowing for a tractable analytical linear analysis .",
    "nevertheless , a more realistic view of the stellar field would include several modes .",
    "these components can be introduced naturally in the following way .",
    "we assume that the stellar interior is inhomogeneous and anisotropic . in some regions inside the star ,",
    "there exist clumps of matter which locally generate a stronger or weaker gravitational potential than the average . in order to compute analytically such kind of gravitational field , we idealize this situation by assuming that the star is made of homogeneous and isotropic matter everywhere ( with total mass  @xmath26 ) . to this perfect spherical geometry , we add a small mass point  @xmath27 located within the surface at a position  @xmath28 .",
    "a finite size inhomogeneity can then be thought as a linear superposition of such point masses .",
    "using spherical coordinates , the total gravitational potential induced by this rotating star is  : @xmath29 where the first term in the right hand side corresponds to the unperturbed spherically symmetric gravitational potential whereas the second term is induced by the small point like inhomogeneity . for simplicity , in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we suppose that the perturber  @xmath30 is located in the equatorial plane of the star  @xmath31 .",
    "the potential therefore becomes  : @xmath32 where the azimuth in the corotating frame is  @xmath33 . these potential can be fourier decomposed by using the laplace coefficients  @xmath34 as follows  : @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the kronecker symbol .",
    "the total linear response of the disk is then the sum of each perturbation corresponding to one particular mode  @xmath24 .",
    "it is a generalization of the quadrupolar field introduced in the previous section .    having in mind to applied this results to a thin accretion disk , it is preferable to use cylindrical coordinates such as  : @xmath37 the second expression as been obtained by assuming that the inhomogeneity is located in the equatorial plane  @xmath38 .",
    "the perturber is located inside the star and the disk never reaches the stellar surface , therefore the laplace coefficients  @xmath34 never diverge because @xmath39 . moreover , because of the term @xmath40 in the integrand eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefflaplace ] ) , the value of the laplace coefficients decreases rapidly with the azimuthal number  @xmath24 . as a result",
    ", only the low azimuthal modes will influence significantly the evolution of the disk . keeping only the few first terms in",
    "the expansion is sufficient to achieve reasonable accuracy .",
    "an example of the numerical values of the laplace coefficients  @xmath34 for  @xmath41 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coefflaplace ] .    ) for  @xmath41 .",
    "values are plotted on a logarithmic scale ( @xmath42 $ ] ) for @xmath43 $ ] . ]",
    "how will the disk react to the presence of this quadrupolar or multipolar component in the gravitational field ? to answer this question , we can first study its linear response . to do this",
    ", we treat each multipolar component as a small perturbation to the equilibrium state prescribed in sec .",
    "[ sec : equinit ] .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations of the accretion disk with adiabatic motion are given by  : @xmath44 all quantities have their usual meanings , @xmath4 being the density of mass in the disk ,  @xmath6 the velocity of the disk , @xmath5 the gaseous pressure , @xmath45 the adiabatic index and  @xmath46 the gravitational field imposed by the star . since we are not interested in the accretion process itself , we neglect the viscosity whatever its origin ( molecular , turbulent , etc ... ) .",
    "perturbing the equilibrium state with respect to the lagrangian displacement  @xmath47 , to first order we get for the eulerian perturbations of the density , velocity and pressure  : @xmath48 making allowance for a perturbation in the gravitational field and following the frieman - rotenberg analysis  ( frieman & rotenberg  @xcite ) , the lagrangian displacement satisfies a second order linear partial differential equation  : @xmath49 we emphasize the fact that the last expression in the above equation contains a term  @xmath50 which is of second order with respect to the perturbation and therefore should be neglected . but in doing so , we suppress the parametric resonance which will be studied in more detail below . depending on the magnitude of the perturbation , this instability will develop on a timescale closely related to the amplitude of the perturbation and should then not be ignored .    introducing the convictive derivative by  @xmath51",
    ", we get for eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdexi ] ) a more concise form  : @xmath52 usually , when evolving in an axisymmetric gravitational field , the above equation reduces to its traditional form where  @xmath53 .",
    "however , in our treatment , due to the gravitational perturbation , a driving force given by  @xmath54 appears .",
    "moreover a parametric resonance is also involved due to the term  @xmath50 .",
    "this will be explained in the next section .",
    "finding an analytical stability criteria for this system is complicated or even an impossible task .",
    "furthermore , we can not apply the classical development in plane wave solutions leading to an eigenvalue problem .",
    "indeed , the presence of some coefficients varying periodically in time including  @xmath55 prevent from such a treatment . however , the problem can be cast into a more convenient form if we treat each component of the lagrangian displacement as independent variables and set the other two components equal to zero .",
    "this simplified 3d analysis is done in section [ sec : analinsimp ] . but",

    "the solutions of eq .",

    ", the pattern speed of the density perturbation is known and equal to the compact object rotation rate .",

    "the single particle approximation remains valid within  10  % .",
    "typical behaviors of the ratio  @xmath73 are depicted for the newtonian and schwarzschild case in fig .",

    "if the disk were assumed to be thick so that @xmath98 , the difference between single particle and fluid frequency can be appreciable . moreover , the orbital motion remains no longer keplerian in such a geometry .",

    "we have  : @xmath99    the star normalized rotation rate around the z - axis is equal to  @xmath100 . assuming a  @xmath101 neutron star , this corresponds to a spin of  @xmath102  hz . the disk inner boundary is located at  @xmath103 while the outer boundary is located at  @xmath104 .",

    "( [ eq : rescorot ] ) is not visible at this stage .",
    "indeed the weak linear growth rate makes the corotation resonance relevant only after a few  @xmath109 orbital revolutions which is hundreds of time more than the time of the simulation .",
    "however , after a few hundred of orbital revolutions , the disk settles down to a new quasi - stationary state in which the inner and outer lindblad resonances persist .",
    "this happens after a transition regime where density waves leave the disk by crossing its edges .",
    "almost all of the energy put into the disk by the star s rotation leaves the computational domain at its inner and outer edges .",
    "the non reflecting boundary conditions act as a kind of viscosity strongly damping the oscillations .",

    "[ fig : solforcee ] , the only small difference comes from the different boundary conditions imposed",
    ". nevertheless , the location of the inner and outer lindblad resonances as well as the number of roots of each function and the maximum amplitude are equal .",
    "the nonlinearities are therefore weak for the whole simulation duration .",
    "indeed , looking at the fourier spectrum of the density in fig .",
    "[ fig : denstfdiscnewt ] , where the amplitude of each component is plotted vs the mode  @xmath24 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the odd modes are not present .",

    "the deviation from the stationary state being weak , the amplitudes of these even modes decay compared to the previous one , the highest being of course  @xmath25 .",
    "thus , even in the full non linear simulation , the regime remains quasi linear . as a conclusion ,",
    "the parametric resonance phenomenon discussed in the previous section is irrelevant at this stage of our work .",
    "the effect of strong nonlinearity putting the system out of its linear regime will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "note that due to the desaliasing process , the modes  @xmath116 are all set to zero .",

    "only the non - wavelike disturbance produces significant changes in the density profile .",
    "the resolution of  @xmath117 which seems rather low is nevertheless justified by the fact that the components of the fourier - tchebyshev transform decay rapidly and become negligible after the first few terms in the fourier expansion and after the first 30 or 40 terms in the tchebyshev expansion . in order to check that this resolution is however sufficient , we performed a new set simulation by increasing the number of grid points by a factor two in both coordinates , namely we used a resolution of  @xmath118 .",

    "the corotation resonance is shown by a vertical bar . ]     but for a perturbation containing many modes . only the lowest fourier modes are excited to a significant level in accordance with the perturbed potential profile . ]",
    "the simulations presented in this paper are preliminary results mainly in order to check the numerical algorithm and to show that pseudo - spectral method are well suited to study accretion flow as was already done by godon  ( @xcite ) . for smooth flows ,",
    "this method shows evanescent error ( exponential decrease with respect to the number of points ) and good accuracy is achieved with relatively small number of discretization points .",
    "the warping of the disk is an important processes to account for qpos because the vertical parametric resonance locations are interesting sites to generate large amplitude in the fluctuation of the luminosity of the accretion disk .",
    "a full three dimensional linear analysis is therefore necessary to track the propagation properties of the waves in a polytropic disk .",
    "moreover , non - linear effect are also important because in the case of magnetized accretion disk , the rotating asymmetric perturbed magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as the background field itself .",
    "full non - linear three dimensional numerical simulations are therefore required .",
    "the numerical code designed here can performed this task with a reasonable computational time by using only little discretization points without losing precision .",
    "the study presented in this paper can be extended to the case of a viscous flow in the disk leading therefore to a `` real accretion disk '' .",
    "the viscosity will set a lower limit on the smallest scale that the density perturbation can reach .",
    "moreover , when adding a damping term in the mathieu equation ( [ eq : mathieu ] ) the threshold for the parametric resonance to grow will be proportional to this viscosity .",
    "we therefore expect strong oscillations only in cases where the amplitude of the perturbation is sufficiently high .",
    "in addition , the lost of energy by radiation damps these oscillations for which the kinetic energy is converted into photon emission . finally , because the radial flux implied by the accretion process will reduce the time available for a fluid element to enter into resonance at a given radius , deviation from equilibrium will become smaller compared to a non accreting situation .",
    "another point not discussed in this work is the pressure induced by the radiation in the vicinity of the inner part of the accretion disk . as for the gaseous pressure , it will shift the resonance conditions derived for a single particle .",
    "a significant increase in the accretion flux induces an increase in the pressure radiation to the same order of magnitude .",
    "how the disk will react remains an open question .",
    "however it provides a correlation between the accretion rate and the orbital frequency at resonance because the resonance conditions eq .",
    "( [ eq : rescorot])-([eq : resforcage])-([eq : respara ] ) will then depend on the total pressure in the disk ( gaseous + radiation ) .",
    "the origin of the rotating asymmetric gravitational field for neutron stars or white dwarfs could be explained in severals ways .",
    "first , an inhomogeneous interior structure would naturally lead to the kind of potential introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : potentielboiteux ] .",
    "a second possibility is the fast rotation of the star .",
    "it leads to strong centrifugal forces deforming the star s spherical shape into a maclaurin spheroid .",
    "thirdly , an aspherical star possessing a precession motion should also generate a significant distorted gravitational potential .",
    "anisotropic magnetic stress in the stellar interior exerts also a deformation on the stellar surface which can be inferred by observation of the atmosphere .",
    "an application to white dwarfs is given by fendt & dravins  ( @xcite ) and for neutron star by bonazzola & gourgoulhon  ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the black hole candidates , the reason for an asymmetry in the spacetime manifold is less evident . when accreting matter , the black hole must get ride of its non - stationary state ( deviation from the kerr - newman geometry ) because of the no - hair theorem . in order to get back to its stationary state",
    ", it must emit gravitational waves described in the general relativity framework .",
    "this replaces the rotating asymmetric newtonian potential . like helioseismology ,",
    "perturbation of the spacetime around black holes gives some insight into their properties .",
    "however , unlike asteroseismology , normal mode oscillations are unavoidably associated to gravitational wave emission .",
    "they are therefore called quasi - normal modes of the black hole because of their damping ( kokkotas & schmidt @xcite ) .",
    "if the qpos observed in the black hole candidates could be associated with the gravitational wave emission and thus with their quasi - normal modes , we would have a new tool to explore their properties as was the case for helioseismology , a kind of `` holoseismology '' .",
    "this idea is discussed in ptri ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of high coherence in the khz - qpos of some systems puts strong constraints on the models .",
    "clumps of matter can not account for the high quality factor @xmath147 ( barret et al .",
    "the coherence time involved by this picture is to long .",
    "we believe that this almost sinusoidal motion can only be imprinted by an external sinusoidal force as for instance a rotating asymmetric field would do . moreover ,",
    "sometimes , a sudden drop in this coherence is observed as was happened in 4u1636 - 536 . like the discrimination between slow and fast rotators  ( ptri @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", it is interpreted as another manifestation of the isco ( barret et al .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the consequences of a weak rotating asymmetric gravitational potential perturbation on the evolution of a thin accretion disk initially in a stationary axisymmetric state .",
    "we have shown that , when one mode is excited , the disk resonates at some radii where the resonance conditions are satisfied and reach a new quasi - stationary state in which some small scale perturbations in the density emanate starting from the inner and outer lindblad resonance .",
    "the non wavelike disturbance rotates at the star s spin while the free wave solutions are irrelevant because of damping process .",
    "only the driven resonance can be maintained and account for qpos having very high quality factors .",
    "for more general gravitational perturbation potentials , the response of the disk is the some of individual modes as long as the system remains in the linear regime .",
    "we gave a example of such a set of resonances in the last part .",
    "the physical processes at hand does not require any general relativistic effect . indeed , the resonances behave identical in the newtonian as well as in the pseudo - kerr field . however , in order to get a detailed precise quantitative idea of the properties of free wave solutions and non wavelike disturbances around neutron star , we need a consistent full general relativistic description of the star - disk system .",
    "this is left for future work .",
    "the possible warping of the disk , not discussed here , needs a full 3d analysis and simulations .",
    "we then expect some low frequency qpos related to the khz qpos in a manner which has still to be determined .",
    "we emphasize that the work presented here is a first step to a new model for the qpos in lmxbs .",
    "a strongly non linear regime is also expected when the gravity perturbation is strong enough .",
    "the parametric resonance not developed in the simulations presented in this paper will then be excited .",
    "this is left for future work .    to conclude , to date we know about 20  lmxbs containing a neutron star and all of them show khz - qpos .",
    "we believe that these qpos could be explained by a mechanism similar to those exposed here .",
    "we need only to replace the gravitational perturbation by a magnetic one as described in paper  i. however , in an accreting system in which the neutron star is an oblique rotator , we expect a perturbation in the magnetic field to the same order of magnitude than the unperturbed one .",
    "therefore , the linear analysis developed in this series of two papers has to be extended to oscillations having non negligible amplitude compared to the stationary state .",
    "we also expect the parametric resonance to become the strongest resonance in the disk . indeed , as shown in previous work in the single particle approximation and in the mhd case ( ptri @xcite , @xcite ) , the twin peak ratio of about 3/2 for the khz - qpos",
    "is naturally explained as well as their difference being either @xmath148 for slow rotator ( @xmath149  hz ) or @xmath150 for fast rotator ( @xmath151  hz ) .",
    "finally , what would happen if we add a gravitational perturbation to a magnetic one ? in the thin and weakly magnetised accretion disk , the linear analysis performed separately in the hydrodynamical as well as in the mhd case remains true when combined together .",
    "we expect again the same resonances to occur at the same locations .",
    "this is the strength of this model because it encompasses in an unique picture the white dwarf ( though to be mainly in the hydrodynamical regime ) and neutron star ( though to be magnetised ) accreting systems , explaining the 3:2 ratio whatever the nature of the compact object . in",
    "has also successfully been extended to accreting black holes by replacing these asymmetries by gravitational wave emission ( ptri @xcite ) . the predicted 3:2 ratio and some lower frequency qpos perfectly match the observations from the microquasar grs1915 + 105 .",

    "<S> this is the second of a series of papers aimed to look for an explanation on the generation of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations  ( qpos ) in accretion disks around neutron star , black hole , and white dwarf binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the model is inspired by the general idea of a resonance mechanism in the accretion disk oscillations as was already pointed out by abramowicz & kluniak ( @xcite ) . in a first paper ( </S>",
    "<S> ptri  @xcite , paper  i ) , we showed that a rotating misaligned magnetic field of a neutron star gives rise to some resonances close to the inner edge of the accretion disk . in this second paper , we suggest that this process does also exist for an asymmetry in the gravitational potential of the compact object . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the same physics applies , at least in the linear stage of the response to the disturbance in the system . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of asymmetry is well suited for neutron stars or white dwarfs possessing an inhomogeneous interior allowing for a deviation from a perfectly spherically symmetric gravitational field . after a discussion on the magnitude of this deformation applied to neutron stars , we show by a linear analysis that the disk initially in a cylindrically symmetric stationary state is subject to three kinds of resonances : a corotation resonance , a lindblad resonance due to a driven force and a parametric resonance . </S>",
    "<S> in a second part , we focus on the linear response of a thin accretion disk in the 2d limit . </S>",
    "<S> waves are launched at the aforementioned resonance positions and propagate in some permitted regions inside the disk , according to the dispersion relation obtained by a wkb analysis . in a last part , </S>",
    "<S> these results are confirmed and extended via non linear hydrodynamical numerical simulations performed with a pseudo - spectral code solving euler s equations in a 2d cylindrical coordinate frame . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for a weak potential perturbation , the lindblad resonance is the only effective mechanism producing a significant density fluctuation . in a last step </S>",
    "<S> , we replaced the newtonian potential by the so called logarithmically modified pseudo - newtonian potential in order to take into account some general - relativistic effects like the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter potential is better suited to describe the close vicinity of a neutron star or a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> however , from a qualitative point of view , the resonance conditions remain the same . </S>",
    "<S> the highest khz qpos are then interpreted as the orbital frequency of the disk at locations where the response to the resonances are maximal . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that strong gravity is not required to excite the resonances . </S>"
