    "recent developments in cosmological observations have led to so - called cosmological concordance model with @xmath1 about 0.03 , @xmath10 ( dark+baryonic ) about 0.3 and @xmath11 about 0.7 . however , as the @xmath0cdm models are dominated by hypothetical vacuum energy and non - baryonic dark matter contributions , some scientists look for different solutions .",
    "perhaps the most intereresting alternative model is the modified newtonian dynamics model ( mond ) proposed by m.milgrom@xcite .",
    "it assumes that there is no non - baryonic dark matter ( or it is negligible ) and the lack of matter is only apparent due to modification of dynamics or gravity for small accelerations ( @xmath12 where @xmath3 is some constant ) .",
    "this model seems to work very well for spiral galaxies and many other types of objects@xcite but , however , it has some unresolved problems ( e.g. lack of covariance ) .    our aim there is to study what would be the implications of the mond model for the formation of the very first objects in the universe .",
    "to apply the mond model to structure formation calculations one encounters a number of difficulties .",
    "first of all , mond is not a theory , it is rather a phenomenological model . in its present form mond",
    "is inconsistent with the general relativity . up to now",
    "there were no successful attempts to find a generally covariant theory that could be a generalisation of the general relativity and would give a mond - like predictions in the low - gravity limit @xcite .",
    "mond is a model that modifies either dynamics or gravity ( in this paper we assume this second possibility ) .",
    "it introduces a new fundamental scale , usually called @xmath3 .",
    "gravitational fields much stronger than @xmath3 are identical to their newtonian limit @xmath13 and very weak fields are @xmath14 . according to sanders and verheijen @xcite the value of the fundamental acceleration scale is @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , the strength of the gravitational field may be written as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is some function that interpolates between these two extreme cases .",
    "this function is not specified in the model .",
    "we have decided to apply the function used by sanders and verheijen @xcite :    @xmath18    and , finally ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 .    if we consider the gravitational field of a point mass @xmath21 , for distances @xmath22 the gravitational field would be in the mond regime , where its strength would decrease as @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 .",
    "it means that there is no escape velocity and all systems are gravitationally bound .",
    "the conseqences of the mond for cosmology are not studied in details yet .",
    "r.h.sanders @xcite suggested that because in the early universe the mond radius is much lower than the radius of the horizon the evolution of the scale factor is described by the standard friedmann equations .",
    "here we follow this assumption and study the formation of the first objects in the universe with modified dynamics .",
    "let us consider a homogenous ball of density @xmath25 and some radius @xmath26 , expanding uniformly in all directions with speed proportional to the distance from the center .",
    "for a sphere of radius @xmath27 the deceleration in the newtonian limit is    @xmath28    and , of course , expansion is scale - invariant because deceleration and velocity always are proportional to the radius @xmath27 .",
    "however , we can find some radius @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31  further we will call that a ` mond radius ' .",
    "for @xmath31 the gravity is in the mond regime and the dynamics is changed .",
    "the evolution of the mond radius @xmath29 in the early universe is discussed in details by sanders @xcite .    in the standard perturbation theory , if the mean density is comparable with the critical density of the universe ( it is true at least for large redshifts ) the recollapse depends very strongly on the value of the overdensity .",
    "regions with mean density less than the critical density will not recollapse at all and vice versa .",
    "moreover , the time of the recollapse is very sensitive to the value of the density . in mond",
    "it is different because there is no critical density",
    ". the overdensity does not play an essential role and the recollapse is similar for regions of different densities .",
    "it is quite easy to derive the linear perturbation theory in the newtonian limit ( e.g. in kolb and turner @xcite ) .",
    "in mond it is much more difficult because there appear nonlinear terms connected with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gravitational potential .",
    "however , it is known that the rare highest fluctuations in the primordial density field were nearly spherically symmetric @xcite , so as long as we are concerned with the very first bound objects in the universe we may assume spherical symmetry .",
    "now let us consider a spherically symmetric overdensity with density profile    @xmath34    of course , the density changes with time because of expansion or recollapse , but the mass inside some shell @xmath35    @xmath36    remains constant , so the deceleration for a shell of radius @xmath37 will be equal to    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the mond gravitational force and it depends on @xmath40 and @xmath3 .",
    "let us drop the subscript @xmath35 .",
    "if we multiply this equation by @xmath41 we get    @xmath42 = -f(r ) { dr\\over dt}\\ ] ]    and after integrating over @xmath43 we obtain    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is some constant which may be easily calculated if we know initial radius and velocity for a given function @xmath47 .",
    "this formula may be easily integrated , e.g. with the runge - kutta algorithm .    to show the difference between the mond and the newtonian gravity , we have performed a set of calculations .",
    "we have traced the evolution of a dust cloud ( no pressure ) expanding homogenously in all directions .",
    "initial radius @xmath37 , velocity @xmath48 , density @xmath49 and time @xmath50 were taken from the @xmath51 friedmann model with no radiation for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "initial radius was chosen to be the mond radius at that time .",
    "we have performed eight runs :    * pure newtonian gravity with the density equal to @xmath49 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 * mond with the density as above * mond with the @xmath3 parameter ten times greater than the standard value and mean density equal to @xmath49 * mond with the @xmath3 parameter ten times lower than the standard value and mean density equal to @xmath49    the results are displayed at fig .",
    "solid curves show the trajectories in the mond model and the long- , middle- and short - dashed ones show the trajectories for the newtonian gravity , mond with large @xmath3 and mond with low @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "for the `` standard '' mond and the newtonian gravity lower curves show the trajectories for runs with greater densities ( @xmath55 ) and upper curves show the trajectories for lower densities ( 0.80@xmath49 ) .",
    "as one could expect , raising or lowering the initial density by 25% does not have a big influence if we apply the mond model while it plays a crucial role for the newtonian gravity if the density is near the critical one ( it is always true in the early universe which is flat at least asymptotically at the beginning )  models with higher densities tend to recollapse while models with the lower one do not .",
    "the results are quite sensitive to the value of @xmath3 because it is the limit between the newtonian and the mond regimes  however , it is a quantitative effect only and the dust clouds in such models will always recollapse .",
    "if we take a perfect gas instead of the pressureless fluid , the evolution will look different because effects of pressure will moderate the recollapse , especially for small systems .",
    "as we assume spherical symmetry , we use lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the following equations :    @xmath56    where @xmath27 is the radius of a sphere of mass @xmath21 , @xmath57 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath58 is the pressure and @xmath25 is the mass density .",
    "here eq.([ciaglosc ] ) is the continuity equation , ( [ promien ] ) and ( [ predkosc ] ) give the acceleration and ( [ energia ] ) accounts for the energy conservation .",
    "the last term in the eq.([energia ] ) describes cooling / heating of the gas , with @xmath0 being the energy absorption ( emission ) rate per unit volume , given in details in @xcite .",
    "we use the equation of state of the perfect gas    @xmath59    where @xmath60 , as the primordial baryonic matter after recombination is assumed to be composed mainly of monoatomic hydrogen and helium , with the fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath61 always less than @xmath62 .    in case of modified gravity , equation ( [ predkosc ] ) will look a bit different :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the function inverse to the function @xmath17 mentioned before and it is asymptotically equal to @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "in the simulations we have used the code described in @xcite , based on the codes described by thoul and weinberg @xcite and haiman , thoul and loeb @xcite .",
    "this is a standard , one - dimensional , second - order accurate lagrangian finite - difference scheme .",
    "the only changes were modification of gravity and putting the dark matter fraction @xmath69 equal to zero . however , it was necessary to make significant changes in initial conditions .",
    "first of all , we start our calculations at the end of the radiation - dominated era . for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and for @xmath7 , @xmath72 as given by the formula provided by hu and eiseinstein @xcite , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , assuming @xmath53 and @xmath75=2.7277 k. we have assumed that , as in the standard cosmology , initial overdensities may grow only in the matter - dominated era .",
    "we have developed and tested our own code to calculate the initial chemical composition and initial gas temperature .",
    "we have compared our results with the results by galli and palla @xcite and they turned out to be very similar  the agreement is at a level of 10 - 20% .",
    "the difference was probably due to the fact that galli and palla have included more species ( e.g. deuterium and lithium ) and some reaction rates that they used were a bit different .",
    "we have performed eight runs , for various combinations of @xmath1 ( 0.02 and 0.05 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath76 and 0 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "total mass of a cloud is about @xmath79 m@xmath80 .",
    "results are displayed on figs .",
    "2 shows trajectories of shells enclosing 7% , 17% , 27% ... 97% of the total mass for the models with the `` standard '' value of @xmath3 .",
    "3 shows the same for the models with @xmath3 10 times lower than the `` standard '' value .    in figures 2 - 5",
    "upper plots are for @xmath9 , lower ones for @xmath7 , plots at left for @xmath81 and plots at right for @xmath82 .",
    "these results show that :    * if we set the cosmological constant to zero , it affects the results very slightly  collapse is a bit slower ( it is due to the fact that non - zero cosmological constant affects behaviour of the scale factor and , thus , the initial velocities ) * time of collapse depends very strongly on @xmath3 * results are more sensitive to the value of @xmath1 for higher @xmath3 * mass @xmath83 m@xmath80 is the boundary between the regime when the gas effects dominate and the cloud virializes without further collapse to a compact object ( or at least this collapse is much slower ) , and the collapse regime when the gas effects may be neglected .",
    "the boundary mass is a bit higher for lower @xmath3 .",
    "the last point needs some comments .",
    "scientists who explore the origin of the large scale structure often neglect gas terms , i.e. set pressure and internal energy equal to zero .",
    "our paper is not the first one that deals with the structure formation in mond  this problem was also explored by sanders ( @xcite and @xcite ) and nusser @xcite but they were interested mainly in the large structure formation and they did not include gas effects .",
    "it is a good approximation for large scales but gas effects play a crucial role in small scale structure formation .    if we look e.g. at fig .",
    "2 , for the outer shells the collapse is almost `` symmetric '' to the expansion , the slow - down by gas pressure is very tiny . in contrast , the most innermost shells show a big asymmetry  expansion , collapse and then shock waves make the matter to virialize ( the kinetic energy of a collapsing shell is turned into the internal energy of the gas ) so the collapse is stopped",
    ". only pressure of the outer shells and the cooling processes ( especially the cooling by molecular hydrogen h@xmath84 ) force them to collapse .    figs .",
    "4 and 5 show the same as figs . 2 and 3 , but as a function of redshift instead of the cosmic time .",
    "they show that the collapse of the first compact objects in mond is really very fast  for high @xmath1 and `` standard '' @xmath3 it happens at @xmath85 , for lower @xmath1 it happens at @xmath86 and for lower @xmath3 at @xmath87 .",
    "it is a very strong prediction and hopefully it may be tested in the future by the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) or ( perhaps ) some its successors  if they discover luminous objects or ionized gas at @xmath88 it will strongly support the mond model .",
    "the last two figures show the evolution of shell temperatures ( fig . 6 ) and chemical composition of a shell enclosing 12% of the total mass ( fig .",
    "7 ) for the runs with non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "upper plots are for the `` standard '' @xmath3 , lower ones for @xmath89 , plots at left for @xmath9 and plots at right for @xmath7 .",
    "shell temperatures behave in a very similar way : they fall ( due to the hubble expansion ) , then rapidly grow ( collapse ) and again fall ( due to the cooling processes ) . for the `` standard '' @xmath3 maximal temperatures are significantly higher ( up to 4500 k for the high-@xmath1 model ) so",
    "the cooling is much more efficient and the final collapse is faster .",
    "it is the effect of higher gravity and , thus , higher outer pressure .",
    "the evolution of chemical composition is qualitatively similar for all runs and all shells .",
    "it behaves similarly to the predictions of background cosmological models up to the time of collapse .",
    "the greatest differences are for @xmath90 and especially @xmath61 which eventually reaches the final abundance of order of @xmath62 .",
    "one should stress that at the time of collapse chemical reactions are much faster because their rates are proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth to note that in order to avoid arbitrarily small timesteps , we have adopted a numerical trick described by thoul and weinberg @xcite : if a shell falls below some radius @xmath92 it is set to some constant value and chemical reactions and cooling are frozen .",
    "it means that the `` flat '' parts of the curves at the end of each plot sometimes preceeded by a strange behaviour of the shell temperature ( very narrow `` peaks '' for the low-@xmath3 models ) are artificial .",
    "if the assumptions of the mond were correct , the `` dark ages '' end very early  about @xmath93 for the `` standard '' @xmath3 and about @xmath94 for @xmath3 10 times lower .",
    "it may be a good test of mond in future because in the standard ( @xmath0)cdm scenario the first luminous objects may appear only for @xmath95 .",
    "however , much more work is necessary in order to understand mond and , in particular , the mond cosmology properly .",
