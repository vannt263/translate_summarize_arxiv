    "photons are attractive as carriers of quantum information because they propagate fast over long distances and interact weakly with their environment .",
    "their utility for quantum information processing applications such as quantum repeaters @xcite or quantum computing @xcite would be further enhanced if it was possible to efficiently implement two - qubit gates between individual photons .",
    "such two - qubit gates can be implemented probabilistically using just linear optics and photon detection @xcite , but strong photon - photon interactions would allow much more direct and deterministic implementations .",
    "several approaches to the implementation of interaction - based photon - photon gates have been proposed , including proposals based on kerr non - linearities in fibers or crystals @xcite , on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in atomic ensembles @xcite , and on the interaction of both photons with an individual quantum system @xcite . see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent experimental progress .    in the simplest case",
    ", an ideal controlled - phase gate performs the transformations @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are zero- and one - photon states respectively . in the present context , the phase @xmath3 acquired by the state @xmath4 is due to the interaction of the two input photons . for quantum information processing applications",
    "it is desirable to achieve @xmath5 . in the first theoretical papers the main focus was on how to achieve interactions that are sufficiently strong to allow large phase shifts .",
    "the photonic pulses were typically idealized as single - mode .",
    "later it was realized that the ( longitudinal ) multi - mode character of the pulses imposes important constraints on the implementation of high - fidelity quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the phase shifts due to the interaction depend on the relative position of the two photons , and take different values over the pulses because the photons have to be described as extended wave packets rather than point particles @xcite . as a consequence , an initial product state of the two photons",
    "is mapped by the interaction onto an output state that exhibits unwanted entanglement in the photons external degrees of freedom . for large phase shifts",
    "this leads to low fidelities for the simplest quantum gate proposals @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this difficulty can be overcome by more sophisticated quantum gate designs where the two photons pass through each other .",
    "this can be achieved by trapping one @xcite or both @xcite of the two photons , by having a counter - propagation geometry @xcite , or by considering two photons with different group velocities @xcite .    here",
    "we show that having the photons pass through each other is not sufficient on its own , due to the presence of the transverse degrees of freedom . in short",
    ", the interaction - induced phases also depend on the relative transverse position of the two photons , which leads to fidelity limitations that can not be mitigated by counter - propagation . in the following we describe these limitations in detail .",
    "we also discuss potential solutions , in particular separating the two wave packets in the transverse direction , which is possible for non - linearities based on long - range interactions .",
    "the general picture for photon - photon gate is the interaction between two fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the field operators at @xmath8 are defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the quantization volume .",
    "they might describe photons in a kerr medium or polaritons in an eit medium .",
    "the field operators satisfy the equal - time commutation relation @xmath11=\\delta_{ij } \\delta({\\bf x - x'})$ ] .",
    "this means that photon absorption is negligible ( e.g. in the eit case the spectra of the pulses are well inside the transparency window ) , so the evolution of the interacting fields can be regarded as unitary . making the standard slowly varying envelope and paraxial approximations , we have the effective hamiltonian @xcite ( @xmath12 is adopted hereafter ) @xmath13 to describe their free evolution . here",
    "@xmath14 is the group velocity in the positive or negative @xmath15 direction , and @xmath16 is the carrier wave vector , @xmath17 is the transverse laplace operator .",
    "the interaction for the two fields is @xcite @xmath18 where the terms of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the sum correspond to self - phase and cross - phase modulation effect , respectively .",
    "given the total hamiltonian @xmath21 , the equation of motion , @xmath22 $ ] , for the counter - propagating fields read @xmath23 with the interaction potential @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    a photon - photon gate is implemented by evolving an input bi - photon state @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the pulse profiles , under the unitary time evolution @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the time - ordering operation , and the operator is factorized using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula .",
    "the first factor in eq . ( [ evolution ] ) describes the free evolution including pulse propagation and pulse diffraction .",
    "the second factor is from the interaction between pulses .",
    "the third factor contains all commutators between the exponents of the first two terms ; they reflect the interplay between pulse motion and pulse interaction , which generally changes the pulse profiles .",
    "the ideal output state under a gate operation would be @xmath30 , with @xmath3 being a homogeneous controlled phase , where we are taking into account the free evolution of the photons .",
    "the actual output state , however , will be @xmath31 @xcite , giving the two - particle wave function @xmath32 , which is generally non - factorisable with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath35 and the controlled phase @xmath3 of a gate operation are determined via the overlap between the actual output state and the freely evolved state @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the corresponding two - particle function for the freely evolved state @xmath39 .",
    "the field equations ( [ eqofmotion ] ) allow one to obtain the evolution of @xmath40 by multiplying @xmath41 to the right of the first equation of ( 3 ) and @xmath42 to the left of the second ; then , the product with @xmath43 and @xmath44 is taken on the addition of the equations , yielding the following linear equation for the two - particle function @xmath45 : @xmath46 here we have used @xmath47 , @xmath48 . with the center of mass coordinate , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the derived equation for @xmath51 can be reduced to @xmath52 with @xmath53 being trivially evolved under the diffraction term @xmath54 .",
    "the above linear equation greatly simplifies the determination of the evolution of interacting pulses .",
    "this simplification is possible because we are considering the interaction between two single photons ( as opposed to multi - photon pulses ) . in the co - moving coordinate that eliminates the term @xmath55 in ( [ relative ] ) , the three factors in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) are translated into @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , to evolve @xmath59 . now",

    "it is not difficult to achieve @xmath67 in practice , making the effects from the third factor insignificant . for simplicity we will not include the first and third factor in the two - particle functions derived below , but the first order contribution from the third factor will be considered in our numerical calculations .",
    "the second factor @xmath57 , where @xmath68 , is the main concern of the present paper .",
    "we will explain its effects with two examples .",
    "[ head - on ]",
    "our first example is a highly local interaction described by a delta function potential , @xmath69 .",
    "this is a good model for non - linearities that are due to the interaction of both photons with the same atom in an atomic ensemble or crystal , or to short - range atomic collisions @xcite .",
    "this interaction gives an output two - particle function @xmath70\\delta^{(2)}({\\bf x}_t)\\ } , \\label{output - delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the heaviside step function . from eq .",
    "( [ output - delta ] ) one sees that the interaction - induced phase is non - zero only if the transverse coordinates of the two photons coincide , i.e. on a subset of configuration space @xmath72 that has measure zero , see fig .",
    "1 . as a consequence",
    ", one has @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the case of an ideal three - dimensional delta function potential",
    "the effective output phase is exactly zero , no matter how strong the interaction between the two photons .",
    "this is closely related to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite for the one - dimensional , but co - propagating case .",
    "one finds essentially equivalent results for any interaction whose range is much shorter than the transverse size of the wave packets .",
    "note that this result is consistent with the non - zero conditional phase for photon - photon interactions obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the evolution is non - unitary , as manifested by a different field operator commutator .",
    "[ head - on ]",
    "related difficulties arise also for more long - range interactions .",
    "this can be seen from our second example , which is motivated by refs .",
    "@xcite . it concerns the interaction between polaritons whose atomic component is in a highly excited rydberg state in an external electric field , cf .",
    "[ head - on ] .",
    "this induces a dipole - dipole interaction between the polaritons , @xmath75 where @xmath76 depends on the specific rydberg states used and @xmath77 is the angle between @xmath78 and the external field ( along which the electric dipoles of the rydberg states are aligned ) .",
    "this is an attractive system because rydberg states have large dipole moments , leading to potentially very strong interactions between the polaritons @xcite .",
    "we consider the situation where the external field is perpendicular to the direction of motion .",
    "we assume the initial pulse profiles to be @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81^{\\frac{1}{2}}h_n(\\frac{x}{\\sigma})e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{x}{\\sigma})^2}$ ] with @xmath82 being the hermite polynomials .",
    "the evolution according to eq .",

    "we have chosen @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ head - on ] . increasing the parameter @xmath91 , which indicates the interaction strength , increases the effective output phase @xmath3 , but diminishes the output fidelity @xmath35 . as a consequence ,",
    "significant phase shifts are completely out of reach if one wants to achieve high fidelities . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have included the first order correction due to the third factor of eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) .",
    "such correction comes from the commutators @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93,\\varphi]$ ] , see eq .",
    "( [ correction ] ) .",
    "the commutators involving higher powers of @xmath94 are shown to be vanishing .",
    "the exponentials of these commutators effect a modification of the intensity profile @xmath95 and a modification of the phase profile @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the main cause for the trade - off between @xmath3 and @xmath35 is the dependence of the interaction - induced phase @xmath97 on the transverse relative position @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , most of the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ head - on ] can be understood by setting the phase in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ dipole - fidelity ] ) as @xmath99 , which is quite accurate for @xmath100 .",
    "it gives rise to transverse mode mixing in the form @xmath101 leading to the deviation from the ideal output two - particle function @xmath102 .",
    "the above analysis shows that the transverse mode mixing ( or transverse mode entanglement ) will develop even if the pulses are initially in a single transverse mode .",
    "this effect , which significantly affects the performance of photon - photon gates , is here described for the first time , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "our analysis also clarifies that the pulse diffraction in the transverse direction has no direct impact on the performance of a photon - photon gate .",
    "it influences gate performance through its interplay with the interaction between pulses , i.e. , by the third factor in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) . compared with the effect of the transverse mode mixing shown in eq .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) , such diffraction - interaction interplay is insignificant in the regime considered here , where the medium length @xmath103 is much smaller than the rayleigh length @xmath104 .",
    "for example , for @xmath105 ( as in our calculations ) it induces corrections only at the few - percent level .    [",
    "we have seen that the transverse multi - mode character of the quantum fields , which leads to a transverse relative position dependence of the interaction - induced phase shifts , has very significant consequences for the fidelity and phase achievable in photon - photon gates .",
    "we will now discuss two potential solutions for this problem .",
    "the first is applicable only to the case of long - range interactions .",
    "it consists in separating the paths of the two photons by a transverse distance @xmath106 that is much greater than the transverse size @xmath66 of the pulses , i.e. , the initial profiles of the pulses will be , for example , @xmath79 and @xmath107 .",
    "with increasing @xmath106 one will approach a situation where the transverse degrees of freedom of the photons can effectively be treated as point - like . as a consequence ,",
    "the effect studied here will diminish .",
    "this is shown in fig . [",
    "separated ] .",
    "we have again chosen a medium length @xmath89 .",
    "interaction - diffraction interplay effects are at or below the @xmath108 level in this case because they depend on the gradients in the interaction - induced phase across the wave packets , which decrease with increasing transverse separation .    the price to pay for the improved fidelities shown in fig .",
    "[ separated ] is that even for dipole - dipole interactions the interaction - induced phase decreases quickly as the transverse separation is increased .",
    "for example , achieving a conditional phase shift @xmath5 with a fidelity @xmath109 requires @xmath110 . comparing to ref .",
    "@xcite , this means that one could work with a principal number of the rydberg state @xmath111 , a transverse wave packet size @xmath112 m , and a group velocity @xmath113 m / s . achieving @xmath5 with a fidelity @xmath114 requires @xmath115 , which is possible provided that , for example , @xmath116 can be increased to 100 , @xmath14 reduced to 1 m / s , and @xmath66 reduced to 5 @xmath117 m .",
    "these requirements are realistic with current technology , in particular rydberg states with @xmath118 were already used in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the second potential solution , which is applicable both to short - range and long - range interactions , consists in imposing strong transverse confinement .",
    "if the confinement energy is much greater than the interaction energy , then excitations to higher - order transverse modes are largely suppressed .",
    "all that the interaction can do in this case is multiply the lowest - order transverse mode by an almost uniform phase factor ( a non - uniform phase would imply non - negligible amplitudes in higher - order transverse modes ) , thus allowing high - fidelity quantum gates .",
    "sufficiently strong confinement could be achieved for example using hollow core photonic crystal fibers @xcite or optical nanofibers @xcite .",
    "the importance of the multi - mode character of quantum fields for the implementation of photon - photon gates had been recognized in the past , but only for the longitudinal degree of freedom .",
    "here we showed that the transverse degrees of freedom also play a significant role , imposing important constraints on the performance of potential quantum gates . for contact interactions the effective phase is essentially always zero ,",
    "no matter how strong the interaction . for long - range interactions",
    "the situation is more favorable , but there are still significant trade - offs between the achievable phase and fidelity .",
    "we discussed two potential solutions .",
    "one is to have a significant transverse separation between the two wave packets , which is possible only for long - range interactions .",
    "the price to pay is the need for an even stronger interaction .",
    "the second potential solution is to impose very strong transverse confinement , which may be possible using hollow fibers or nanofibers . in any case",
    "it will be essential for future implementations of photon - photon gates to take transverse multi - mode effects into account .",
