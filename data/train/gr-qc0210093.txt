    "spherical gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors will almost certainly be , in one of its variants ( solid , hollow or dual ) , the next generation of acoustic antennae , due to their multimode - multifrequency capabilities @xcite , as well as their potentially enhanced sensitivity relative to their currently operating cylindrical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "conviction that this is going to be the case has encouraged a remarkable research effort within the gw community , and a variety of important topics have been addressed , ranging from theoretical to practical aspects of the problem .",
    "several countries worldwide are currently developing projects to build and operate spherical detectors  @xcite .",
    "some of the salient properties of a spherical body as a detector of gws can be accurately established by means of an idealised model , where dissipative effects can be safely overlooked  @xcite .",
    "such effects are however very important when it comes to determining the ultimate sensitivity of the device , due to their fundamental bearing on the _ noise _ characteristics of the antenna via the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem , more specifically its _",
    "spectral density_.    in a solid elastic body",
    "there are many oscillation modes in addition to the fundamental one chosen for gw detection , which therefore add noise to the frequency band of operation .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that normal mode analysis of this contribution to the noise level can be either inconvenient or too expensive in terms of computational cost if heat is e.g.  generated by a laser spot on the oscillating solid , such as happens in an interferometric gw detector or in a dual sphere  @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements clearly show that this is the case  @xcite .",
    "the nave approach , and actually the one most often taken , to account for dissipative effects is to add an _ ad hoc _ term proportional to the velocity in the solid s eigenfrequency equation .",
    "this results in a damped oscillatory behaviour of the sort    @xmath1    where the _ quality factor q _ is assumed constant ( i.e. , time independent ) , and accounts for the linewidth of the mode with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that this quality factor is different for different oscillation modes , so the set of @xmath3 s is very large , and the procedure appears highly artificial . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been criticism of the concept of dissipation forces proportional to velocity in terms of actual noise spectrum in an elastic solid  @xcite , and suggestion that a better description may rather derive from the use of _ complex _ frequencies .    in the specialised literature on the subject",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein ) , viscoelastic effects are often described by means of so called _ constituent equations_. these are extensions of hooke s law relating the stress and strain tensors in the solid .",
    "much like in a simple one - dimensional spring , internal friction forces can be considered proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the oscillating mass , hence constituent equations usually contain time derivatives of those tensors , and depend on a small number of viscosity parameters , to be added to the elastic lam coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 see below .",
    "there is however no unique way in which this idea can be carried over from a one - dimensional system into a constituent equations set for a three - dimensional solid , and so different alternatives result in different models for the purpose .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study and discuss the results of applying to a spherical gw detector the equations of various such phenomenological models , in view to determine how quality factors change from mode to mode in each case .",
    "this , it is hoped , will generate some insight into the nature of the viscous processes which take place in a specific spherical gw detector , and help to assess on the basis of spectral measurements which particular class of viscoelastic solid a given material belongs to . in turn , better understanding of material s macroscopic properties should also contribute relevant information to the currently important issue of spherical gw detector design . in section  [ sec.2 ]",
    "we present the general equations , and in the subsequent sections we successively consider the kelvin  voigt , maxwell , standard linear and genaralised mechanical models . as we shall see , the sphere s vibration eigenmodes always group into the usual families of _ toroidal _ ( purely torsional ) and _ spheroidal _ modes , but different quality factor dependences arise in different models . in section  [ sec.6 ]",
    "we match our theoretical results to a number of experimental measurements of quality factors performed on various spheres , and discuss which is the most appropriate model to fit such data . in the final section we present a summary of conclusions , and two appendices are added to clarify a few mathematical technicalities .",
    "gws bathing the earth are known to be extremely weak see e.g. @xcite for a review so that the classical equations of linear elasticity are very good to describe the gw induced motions of a spherical antenna in the expected frequency range , roughly 10@xmath610@xmath7 hz . these equations are @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the field of displacements in the elastic body , and @xmath10 is the gw induced density of forces acting on the solid see @xcite for full technical details .",
    "@xmath11 is the the _ stress _ tensor , and is related to the _ strain _ tensor    @xmath12    through a set of _ constituent equations_. in the case of a non - dissipative ( ideal ) solid these are simply the expression of hooke s law . in a dissipative one ,",
    "such equations include _ time derivatives _ of both @xmath13 and @xmath11 to account for internal friction effects .",
    "constituent equations are of the following general type :    @xmath14    in this paper we shall limit ourselves to _ linear _ constituent equations , an excellent approach for a gw detector , as already stressed . in the simplest instance , only first order derivatives will appear in  , and we shall consider this first . then we shall also devote some attention to more complicted models .    the equations of motion   must be supplemented with suitable _",
    "boundary conditions_. we shall prescribe the usual ones    @xmath15    where * n * is a unit outward - pointing vector , expressing that the surface of the sphere is free from any tensions and/or tractions .",
    "this model assumes that the solid is homogeneous and isotropic , and is characterised by the following constituent equations @xcite :    @xmath16    the constants @xmath4 and @xmath17 are the usual lam coefficients describing the purely elastic behaviour of the body @xcite , while the positive coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 parametrise its _ viscous _ properties ) and _ bulk _ viscosity ( @xmath20 ) . ] , which are proportional to the change rate of the strain tensor , @xmath21 .",
    "if equations   are replaced into   we obtain the equations of motion for @xmath9 :    @xmath22    \\,\\nabla(\\nabla{\\bf \\cdot}{\\bf s } ) + { \\bf f}({\\bf x},t )    \\label{eqmovkv}\\ ] ]    the solution to this system of coupled equations can be expressed in terms of a green function , the construction of which requires explicit knowledge of its _ eigenmode _ solutions .",
    "as is well known , the latter correspond to the free oscillations of the solid no density of external forces in the rhs of  . as usual , we attempt to find such eigen - solutions in the factorised form    @xmath23    which results in the following ( dots on symbols stand for time derivatives ) :    @xmath24    \\nabla^2{\\bf s}({\\bf x } ) \\nonumber \\\\[1 ex ]    & + & \\left[(\\lambda+\\mu)t(t ) + ( \\lambda'+\\mu')\\dot t(t)\\right ]    \\nabla\\left(\\nabla{\\bf\\cdot}{\\bf s}({\\bf x})\\right )    \\label{eqmovkv2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we use the well known decomposition of a three dimensional vector field into its irrotational a divergence free components  @xcite :    @xmath25    by the methods described in  [ aa ] , it can be seen that the equations satisfied by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are   , i.e. ,    @xmath29 and    @xmath30    since @xmath28 must fulfil _ both _ equations   and  , the _ separation constants _ @xmath31 and @xmath32 are _ not _ independent .",
    "the binding relationship is established after it is realised that the solution to those equations is of the form    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is in general a _ complex _ quantity .",
    "we readily obtain    @xmath35^{-1 }   \\label{kq.a } \\\\     { \\cal k}^2 & \\!= \\ ! & -\\rho\\gamma^2\\left     [ \\mu+\\gamma\\,\\mu'\\right]^{-1 } \\label{kq.b }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the values @xmath34 can possibly take on are determined by the _ boundary conditions _ , equations  .",
    "the reader is referred to  [ ab ] for a detailed description of the eigenvalue algebra of this problem . just as in the non - dissipative case ,",
    "there are seen to be two families of eigenmodes : _ toroidal _ ( purely torsional ) and _ spheroidal_. viscous effetcs are however small in practice , as inferred from the narrow _ linewidth _ of the measured resonances .",
    "this means that the following inequalities hold in any cases of interest to us :    @xmath36    where @xmath2 is the frequency of the mode considered .",
    "we shall use these inequalities to estimate the roots of the eigenvalue equation   ( see  [ ab ] ) _ perturbatively _ from the non - dissipative ones , already known see @xcite for full details .",
    "clearly thus , our procedure will be valid for the lower frequency modes .",
    "we proceed sequentially for the two families of eigenmodes .",
    "these correspond to the solutions to ( see  )    @xmath37    which is _ formally _ identical to the toroidal eigenvalue equation for a non - dissipative solid sphere  @xcite .",
    "if we call @xmath38 the toroidal wave numbers of the latter , we have    @xmath39    and hence , by equation  ,    @xmath40    where the last approximation depends on the validity of the assumption  . expression   nicely shows how this kelvin - voigt model predicts _ exponentially damped",
    "_ eigenmode oscillations . if we recall that such damping is expediently described in terms of a _ quality factor q _ see   above then we discover that the prediction of the model is that    @xmath41    i.e. , the quality factor for toroidal modes is _ inversely proportional _ to the frequency of the mode .",
    "the _ amplitudes _ of these modes have the form    @xmath42    where the subindex @xmath43 stands for ` kelvin - voigt ' , while @xmath44 refers to the standard frictionless case , whose amplitudes are those given e.g. in reference @xcite .      a second alternative to find a non - trivial solution of the linear system   is to impose the condition",
    "@xmath45    this is characteristic of the _ spheroidal _ eigenmodes . by virtue of equations   and",
    ", this relationship can be translated into a condition to be fufilled by @xmath46 , and which depends on the ratios @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as well as on the multipole index @xmath50 . in this case , as we are not dealing with an eigenvalue problem of a selfadjoint operator , complex solutions to equation   are allowed indeed , expected .",
    "an exact solution of that equation implies a separation of its real and imaginary parts , followed by numerical calculations which determine the angular frequency and quality factor of the quasinormal mode at hand .",
    "we are interested in materials with long decay times , so we shall set up a perturbative solution to equation  , using    @xmath51    as the small perturbative parameter .",
    "in other words , we assume that the approximation   holds . here",
    ", @xmath2 stands for a generic spheroidal eigenfrequency of the non - dissipative solid . obviously , the unperturbed solution , i.e. , that corresponding to @xmath52=0 , is the elastic solid s solution , already discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "we thus introduce the perturbative expansion    @xmath53    using equations  , and  , we obtain perturbative expansions for the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 which can be written as    @xmath56    where    @xmath57    & q_0=q=\\omega\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda+2\\mu}}\\ , \\qquad      q_1=i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda+2\\mu}}\\left(\\gamma_1 +      \\frac{h'+2}{h+2}\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right ) &      \\label{kq.b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above equations , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the parameters appearing in the elastic sphere s case , and we have introduced the dimensionless ratios    @xmath60    which are both zero order quantities",
    ". we can now perform the perturbative expansion of the eigenvalue equation . in order to ease the resulting expressions ,",
    "let us introduce the following notation :    @xmath61\\epsilon   \\nonumber   \\\\   & \\equiv & a_0+(a_1q_1r - ia'_1)\\,\\epsilon   \\label{bet4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime on a @xmath62 function denotes differentiation with respect to its _ first _ argument .",
    "we note that the functions @xmath63 ( defined in every second line of the above set of equations ) are real . with this notation ,",
    "the zero - th order form of equation   is    @xmath64    which is simply the condition that @xmath2 be a spheroidal eigenvalue of the purely elastic case . on the other hand , the first order expansion of   yields    @xmath65    whence , using the form of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the value of @xmath68 ensues .",

    "real_. therefore , to this order of approximation , the frequencies of vibration remain unaltered , and are the same as those obtained for the elastic solid .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 and @xmath67 happen to be purely imaginary .",
    "therefore , the modulus of the radial functions appearing in the spatial part of spheroidal quasinormal modes of vibration will also be the same as those of the ideally elastic solid , for the corrections to @xmath72 and @xmath73 will just introduce , to first order , a _",
    "complex phase _ factor .",

    "the real phases @xmath83 can be computed from equations  - , , and  .",
    "nevertheless , the explicit ( and cumbersome ) form of these phases is largely irrelevant , and whe shall omit its explicit form here  @xcite .",
    "they merely introduce a position dependent shift in the phase of the vibrations which is of order @xmath52 , therefore not likely to give rise to measurable effects .",
    "more interesting and physically relevant is the behaviour of the function @xmath70 giving the precise dependence of the quality factor on frequency .",
    "first of all , it is easily seen that , for the special case @xmath75=@xmath76 , @xmath70 is equal to  1 , and thus the quality factor is proportional to @xmath84 , as was the case with toroidal modes .",
    "but when the aforementioned equality does not hold , numerical calculations are needed .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows that this function has a rather irregular dependence on frequency .",
    "we have represented @xmath70 for the first 18  eigenvalues of the spheroidal spectrum , where the inequality   safely holds .",
    "it is clear from equation   that holding fixed @xmath75 and @xmath85 leaves us with a _ linear _ function of @xmath76 , whose slope varies from root to root .",
    "in this section we shall consider constituent equations given by the so called maxwell model . like the kelvin - voigt ,",
    "these equations only involve first order time derivatives .",
    "as we shall see , quite different predictions will be obtained for the quality factor dependence on the mode frequencies .",
    "the maxwell model is also isotropic and homogenous , and is characterised by the following constituent equations @xcite :    @xmath86    here , the constants @xmath4 and @xmath17 are again the lam coefficients describing the elastic behaviour of the body , while the constants @xmath87 and @xmath62 parametrise the effects due to internal friction . to construct factorised solutions",
    ", we must also factorise both stress and strain is assumed to be separable in the fashion   then the strain tensor is separable too , and due to the constituent equation it is easily seen that the only possible time dependence is of the form . ] :    @xmath88    the constituent equation is thus written , after separation of variables and contraction of its free indices , as    @xmath89    and hence we have the following relationship between the spatial parts of stress and strain :    @xmath90    like in the kelvin - voigt model , we shall be mainly interested in the case of small internal friction , so we shall assume    @xmath91    whence the following constituent relationship results :    @xmath92    where we have introduced a new constant , @xmath93 , defined by    @xmath94    so that we can take as the parameters characterizing the maxwell solid the set consisting of the lam coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath17 , and the parameters @xmath95 , @xmath96 which describe internal friction .",
    "let us compare equation   with that of the kelvin  voigt model cf .",
    " once the separation of variables has been performed :    @xmath97    comparing equations   and  , we observe that the solution of the maxwell model can be carried out , as regards the spatial part of @xmath98 , following the same method used in the previous section for the kelvin  voigt model .",
    "in fact , we can directly take the expressions there derived , and make the substitutions    @xmath99    which transform equation   into  .",
    "thus the form of the solutions and boundary conditions for a maxwell viscoelastic sphere are those of  [ ab ] with constants @xmath100 and @xmath101 now given by the following functions of the parameter @xmath46 :    @xmath102    \\label{kqm.a }   \\\\[1 ex ]    { \\cal k}&=&i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\mu}}\\left(\\gamma+\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right )    \\label{kqm.b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the approximation   has been taken into account , and @xmath75@xmath103@xmath47 .",
    "thus the two families of quasinormal modes of vibration are also present in this model , and we describe them in the following subsections .",
    "as already discussed , the allowed values for @xmath46 are again those making the linear system   compatible , and there are two alternative ways to accomplish this . the first possibility yields purely tangential ( @xmath104 ) vibrations satisfying once more the condition    @xmath105    @xmath106 being a toroidal eigenfrequency of the elastic sphere . using the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath54 for a maxwell solid given by equations  - ,",
    "we obtain the allowed values  @xmath107 as    @xmath108    again , toroidal quasinormal modes have two fundamental properties : they have the same set of eigenfrequencies as the elastic sphere ( to first order in the parameters describing internal friction , @xmath95 in this case ) , and also exactly the same spatial part ( for _ all _ values of the viscosity parameters ) .",
    "the only difference between kelvin  voigt and maxwell solids as regards toroidal modes appears in the dependence of the quality factor on @xmath109 : as equation   shows , the quality factor in a linear maxwell solid increases linearly with frequency .",
    "we can express all these properties by means of the following formul :    @xmath110    relating maxwell quasi - normal modes of vibration , @xmath111 , to elastic normal modes , @xmath112 , for the toroidal family .      in order to handle the spheroidal family",
    ", we shall resort again to the perturbative expansions already used in the kelvin ",
    "voigt case , and also in the toroidal family , just described .",
    "the maxwell model trivially reduces to the perfect elastic case when @xmath62=@xmath93=0 , hence we can take as the perturbative parameter    @xmath113    where @xmath2 is the elastic eigenfrequency to which @xmath34 approaches when both @xmath62 and @xmath96 approach zero .",
    "perturbative expansions in the fashion of section  [ qnsphm ] can now be introduced :    @xmath114    where the first order corrections @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by equations  - as functions of  @xmath68 :    @xmath115    q_1 & = & i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda+2\\mu}}\\left(\\gamma_1 +            \\frac{h'+2}{h+2}\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right )     \\label{kqm.b }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the zero  order ratio @xmath76 is now given by    @xmath116    with this definition , together with that of the perturbative parameter , the expressions at hand are formally identical to those of the kelvin  voigt model , and therefore the solutions to the maxwell model share all their properties with their kelvin ",
    "voigt counterparts ; the exception is the dependence of the quality factor on frequency : the product @xmath117 , which gives the exponential decay , is now _",
    "independent  of _",

    "summing up , spheroidal quasinormal modes of the maxwell solid , @xmath118 , are related to spheroidal normal modes of a perfectly elastic sphere by the equations    @xmath119    where the function @xmath120 is again given by  .    as we see , the only difference between the behaviour of maxwell and kelvin ",
    "voigt viscoelastic solids , when the internal friction effects can be considered small , appears in the dependence of @xmath3 on frequency . we must however stress that , under other conditions ( e.g. static load ) , both models show larger divergences in their physical properties  @xcite .",
    "in this section we review other models which have been proposed to address the dynamics of a viscoelastic solid .",
    "they are generalisations of those in the two previous sections .",
    "we shall however not attempt to find complete solutions to all of them , as it eventually becomes too cumbersome .",
    "we shall however discuss in this section some of their most relevant traits .",
    "the standard linear model ( slm ) for a viscoelastic solid is a generalised combination of the kelvin ",

    "i.e. , for small internal friction , both models have the same set of quasinormal modes of vibration , which are characterized by the constants @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the latter being given , for the standard linear solid , by equations  .",
    "the models analyzed so far are the simplest ones obtained by three dimensional generalisations of mechanical viscoelastic models composed of linear springs .",
    "they give rise to differential constituent relations , with time derivatives up to the first order .",
    "considering more involved generalisations yields differential relations involving higher order time derivatives of strain and stress see e.g. @xcite .",

    "is obtained from the eigenvalue equation of the elastic model :    @xmath152    upon substitution of @xmath17 by @xmath151 , we obtain    @xmath153    we know that the only solutions to the eigenvalue equation  [ alteigen ] are the _ real _ eigenfrequencies of the elastic sphere @xmath106 , and therefore the allowed values for @xmath149 are given by the implicit relationship    @xmath154    let us now write the polynomials @xmath155 and @xmath156 in the form    @xmath157    as a suitable one to imply that internal friction effects are small , letting    @xmath158    the quantities @xmath159 and @xmath160 are thus zero order in @xmath161 and dimensionless , @xmath109 being a toroidal eigenvalue of the elastic case .",
    "we then introduce an expansion for @xmath149 in the small parameter @xmath161 , whose zeroth order term corresponds to a given toroidal eigenfrequency @xmath2 of the elastic solid :    @xmath162    under the above conditions , we have    @xmath163    and the value of @xmath164 follows when introducing the above expansion into equation  , yielding    @xmath165    in terms of @xmath164 , the quality factor reads    @xmath166}\\ ] ]    where im[@xmath167 denotes the imaginary part of its argument . thus we observe that , as regards toroidal modes , using a general differential model gives us a _ polynomial _ in @xmath2 for @xmath168 , with no independent term , so that constant @xmath3 is not allowed by these models .",
    "the polynomial only contains _ odd _ powers of the unperturbed frequency @xmath109 . in general , whenever @xmath169@xmath1700 for even @xmath50 , the real part of @xmath164 will not vanish , and the angular frequency of the periodic component of the quasinormal modes shall undergo first order corrections .",
    "hence , in order to preserve the elastic spectrum to first order , our model must satisfy the conditions    @xmath171    provided the preceeding equation holds , the corrections to @xmath54 will be purely imaginary , and therfore the modulus of the spatial part of the modes will remain unaltered , the only effect of viscosity being the addition of a point dependent phase in the fashion of equation  @xmath1723 .",
    "this is why it was absent in the toroidal families of the previously discussed models . ] .",
    "the calculation for the spheroidal quasinormal modes can be performed along the same lines but , as we have seen , the algebra is considerably more involved already in the simplest models",
    ". it does naturally become more cumbersome as the order of the model increases , so we omit a detailed discussion of its technicalities here .",
    "we now present a confrontation of the above theoretical models with available experimental measurements , some of them published  @xcite , and others unpublished as of this date  @xcite .",
    "it is very important , in order to rightly assess the suitability of the theoretical models , to keep in mind that measurements of @xmath3 are intrinsically difficult .",
    "the most important source of problems is the fact that almost any experimental environment conditions ( suspensions , readout , electronics , etc . ) significantly couple to the primary oscillator ( the sphere itself ) , and almost invariably result in a _ degradation _ of the measured @xmath173 . the way and intensity in which this happens is however utterly unpredictable . as a rule , theoretical @xmath3 values",
    "should thus be expected _ larger _ than measured ones .",
    "s of the lower frequency modes match the theoretical predictions fairly well , assuming a maxwell model with viscoelastic ratios @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "the higher mode in cual , however , considerably deviates from calculations .",
    "[ f2],title=\"fig:\",width=359 ] s of the lower frequency modes match the theoretical predictions fairly well , assuming a maxwell model with viscoelastic ratios @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "the higher mode in cual , however , considerably deviates from calculations .",
    "[ f2],title=\"fig:\",width=359 ]    s are fairly well fit by a maxwell model with a viscoelastic ratio @xmath176 , while higher frequency @xmath3 s require a kelvin ",
    "voigt with viscoelastic ratio @xmath177 . in this case there",
    "more experimental points than theoretical due to mode splitting caused by the sphere suspension see text .",
    "[ f3],width=415 ]    then , the mode frequencies slightly split up as an unavoidable consequence of the necessity to _ suspend _ the sample in the laboratory a fact not considered in the above models . this , at times , generates a forest of frequency peaks when different multipole modes happen to be close to one another . for example , within a mere 0.8% of their nominal value , we find the three fundamental frequencies : @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 which , if split up , result in as many as 23  fourier peaks in a very reduced frequency interval . on the other hand , however , the @xmath3 s of the various multiplet components often group around clearly distinct values , close to those predicted by theory . in such cases , therefore , the viscoelastic model is helpful to tell the different multiplet members from one another , an otherwise very difficult task .    rather than characterising a given viscoelastic model by the two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , or @xmath87 and @xmath62 see sections  [ sec.3 ] and  [ sec.4] , it is expedient for the purposes of this section to use a different parameter pair .",
    "this will be chosen as the @xmath3 of the lowest frequency toroidal mode , @xmath181 , and the viscoelastic ratio @xmath182 of sections  [ qnsphm ] and  [ sec.4b ] .",
    "the following expressions thus hold :    @xmath183    q^p_{nl } = \\left({\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{\\omega^t_{12}}{\\omega^p_{nl}}$}}\\right)\\ ,          f(k^p_{nl}r , h , h')\\,q_0    \\end{array}\\right .   \\label{equiq.a } \\\\[1.2 em ]    \\mbox{\\sf maxwell : } & \\quad &    \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll }    q^t_{nl } = \\left({\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{\\omega^t_{nl}}{\\omega^t_{12}}$}}\\right)\\,q_0 \\\\[1 em ]    q^p_{nl } = \\left({\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{\\omega^p_{nl}}{\\omega^t_{12}}$}}\\right)\\ ,          f(k^p_{nl}r , h , h')\\,q_0    \\end{array}\\right .",
    "\\label{equiq.b }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously a rewrite of the corresponding ones in the respective sections .    in figure  [ f2 ] we plot the measured versus theoretically calculated values of @xmath3 for two sample spheres of al5056 and a 7% alloy of cual see more technical data in the caption to the figure .",
    "agreement is quite good , when a maxwell model is used , except for the higher frequency mode , reported in the case of cual .",
    "it appears that a better fit can be accomplished when a combination of both maxwell and kelvin  voigt models is used , such as we see in figure  [ f3 ] , where @xmath3 s of a sample sphere of steel are considered .",
    "the latter plot contains more experimental points than theoretical , and we see here a clear example of frequency splittings due to symmetry breaking caused by suspension , normally a diametral or semi - diametral bore drilled across the sphere  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of whether it is possible to systematically characterise the linewidths or , equivalently , the @xmath3 s of the oscillation eigenmodes of a given spherical gw detector . to this end",
    "we have considered various phenomenological models , selected from the specialised literature on the subject , and solved the equations of motion in the cases of our interest .",
    "different models are seen to predict different frequency dependences of the quality factors for the lower modes , which are the ones we have paid attention to , and the ones relevant for gw detection purposes .",
    "for example , in a kelvin ",
    "voigt solid the @xmath3 of a given mode appears to be inversely proportional to its frequency , while in a maxwell solid it is directly proportional to it .",
    "as we have seen , however , the behaviour of a given material is generally not well described by a _",
    "single _ such model but rather by a suitable combination of e.g.  maxwell and kelvin  voigt models , depending on the range of frequencies considered .",
    "this is not too surprising , as these models are _ phenomenological _ , i.e. , they are not based on a detailed analysis of the _ physics _ of the various dissipation mechanisms which are responsible for the loss processes  @xcite , but on more or less plausible ( though not unique ) generalisations of the `` friction is proportional to velocity '' principle , which so accurately holds in a simple unidimensional harmonic oscillator .    in spite of these limitations , and also in spite of the experimental difficulties inherent in the determination of @xmath173",
    ", it appears that our treatment of the problem gives results which can be considered quite good , in view of the above limitations .",
    "a significant bonus of the present analysis is the possibility it offers to identify nearby frequencies in the sphere spectrum by their distinct value of @xmath173 , as predicted by theory .",
    "this is useful in gw detection science since , for example , the _ second _ spheroidal quadrupole frequency , @xmath178 , is very important due to large cross section for gw energy absorption in that mode  @xcite yet it is very close ( in frequency ) to other modes with different @xmath3 s .",
    "improvements on the results presented in this paper are certainly possible .",
    "but we feel they would have to be based on a different methodology , with more emphasis _ ab initio _ on solid state lore , and/or on materials science .",
