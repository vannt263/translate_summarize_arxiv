    "there is no doubt that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are an important component in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the seminal discovery that massive galaxies in the local universe harbor a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) indicates that they must have hosted agn activity over the past @xmath4  13  gyrs ( e.g. ,  soltan 1982 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , the close relationship between the mass of the smbh and the spheroid in local galaxies points towards a close connection between the growth of the smbh and the host galaxy ( e.g. ,  magorrian et  al . 1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "finally , the most successful galaxy formation and large - scale structure models require agn outflows to suppress star formation and reproduce the properties of massive galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. ,  croton et  al .",
    "2006 ; bower et  al .",
    "2006 ) .    stellar population synthesis modelling of nearby galaxies and studies of the cosmic history of star formation indicate that the bulk of the stellar build up of massive galaxies must have occurred at high redshift ( @xmath0  2 ; i.e. ,  when the universe was @xmath4  25% the current age ; e.g. ,  heavens et  al .",
    "2004 ; hopkins et  al . 2006 ) . under the assumption that the growth of the smbh is concordant with that of the galaxy spheroid",
    ", the dominant growth phase of smbh growth in massive galaxies must also have occurred at high redshift .",
    "currently the most _ efficient _ identification of agns ( and therefore smbh growth ) is made with deep x - ray surveys ( e.g.,brandt & hasinger 2005 ) .",
    "for example , the deepest x - ray surveys ( e.g. ,  alexander et  al . 2003 ; luo et  al .",
    "2008 ) are able to detect even moderately luminous agn activity at @xmath0  2 ( @xmath5@xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 ; i.e. ,  @xmath8 times below the canonical threshold assumed for quasars ) .",
    "furthermore , the high rest - frame energies probed by these surveys at @xmath0  2 ( @xmath4  1.524  kev ) means that the selection of agns is _ almost _ obscuration independent . this latter point is important since the dominant growth phase of massive galaxies appears to have been heavily obscured by dust and gas ( e.g. ,  chapman et  al .",
    "2005 ; le floch et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "in this brief contribution we hightlight some of our recent work aimed at identifying obscured agn activity in distant rapidly evolving galaxies at @xmath0  2 ; see  2 &  3 .",
    "we discuss these results within the context of the smbh ",
    "sperhoid growth phase of today s massive galaxies ( @xmath9  @xmath10 ) ; see  4 .",
    "due to the negative @xmath11-correction for ir - luminous galaxies at @xmath12 , submm / mm surveys select the most bolometrically luminous systems in the universe ( e.g. ,  blain et  al . 2002 ; @xmath13  @xmath14 ) . after intense multi - wavelength follow - up observations it is now clear that submm - emitting galaxies ( smgs ; @xmath15  mjy ) are gas - rich massive galaxies at @xmath0  2 hosting energetic star - formation activity ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) ; the stellar  dynamical and co gas masses of these galaxies are typically @xmath16  @xmath10 and @xmath17  @xmath10 , respectively ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the compactness and high inferred gas density of the co emission from smgs suggests that the co dynamics trace the mass of the galaxy spheroid ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that every massive galaxy ( @xmath18  13  @xmath19 ) in the local universe underwent at least one submm - bright phase at some time in the distant past ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask the question : do these intense starbursts also host agn activity ?",
    "early comparisons between x - ray and submm surveys showed little overlap between the two populations .",
    "however , using the deepest x - ray observations available ( the 2  ms _ chandra _ deep field - north survey ; alexander et  al .",
    "2003 ) , we found that a large fraction ( @xmath4  2850% ) of smgs host x - ray weak agn activity ( alexander et  al .",
    "2005a ) . with x - ray color - color diagnostics the amount of absorption towards the agn in individual smgs could be assessed . by stacking the x - ray data of agns with the same apparent amount of absorption , it was then possible to construct good - quality composite x - ray spectra , allowing the definitive features of x - ray absorption to be identified ( photo - electric absorption cut off ; possible fe  k@xmath20 emission ) ; see fig .  1 .",
    "these analyses indicate that the majority ( @xmath4  85% ) of the agns in smgs are heavily obscured ( @xmath3  @xmath2 ) and some may be compton thick ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) ; see  3 for other constraints on compton - thick agns .",
    "however , even correcting for the presence of absorption , the agn activity in smgs was typically found to be of moderate luminosity ( @xmath21  10@xmath2210@xmath23  erg  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "given the huge bolometric luminosities of these systems , we suggested that , although agn activity is often present , star formation is likely to dominate the energetics of smgs .",
    "_ spitzer_-irs observations have indeed shown that the mid - ir spectra of smgs are dominated by star - formation activity , but often have an underlying continuum component of agn activity ( e.g. ,  menendez - delmestre et  al .",
    "2007 ; pope et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "the majority of the agns identified in the smg population are obscured . however , even with a 2  ms _ chandra _ exposure , the most heavily obscured agns can be weak or undetected at x - ray energies .",
    "the most challenging sources to identify are compton - thick agns with @xmath1  @xmath2 . in the local universe , compton - thick agns comprise @xmath4  50% of the agn population ( e.g. ,  risaliti et  al . 1999 ) and , given claims of a possible increase in agn obscuration with redshift ( e.g. ,  la franca et  al .",
    "2005 ) , it is expected that at least @xmath4  50% of the distant agn population will also be compton thick .",
    "the most robust identification of compton - thick agns is made with x - ray spectroscopy , where the presence of a high equivalent width fe  k emission line and a steeply rising reflection component at @xmath8  kev reveals that little or no x - ray emission is being seen directly ( e.g. ,  george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "however , the extreme absorption towards a compton - thick agn renders the observed x - ray emission orders of magnitude fainter than the intrinsic emission ( i.e. ,  the emission corrected for absorption ) .",
    "for example , the nearby well - studied agn ngc  1068 has an intrinsic x - ray luminosity comparable to agns identified in smgs but , due to the presence of extreme absorption ( @xmath24  @xmath2 ; i.e. ,  heavily compton thick ) , if placed at @xmath0  2 it would have an estimated flux @xmath4  10 times below the sensitivity limit of the 2  ms cdf - n observations .",
    "this illustrates the considerable challenges in identifying distant compton - thick agns .",
    "50 compton - thick agns have been robustly identified in the universe , most at low redshift , a paltry @xmath25 of the cosmic population ( comastri 2004 ) ! ] clearly , in order to be able to provide a complete census of agn activity ( and therefore the cosmic history of smbh growth ) it is necessary to be able to identify such heavily obscured agns without the need for high - quality x - ray spectroscopy ; the latter will be challenging before the next generation of x - ray observatories , requiring @xmath26  ms x - ray exposures .",
    "significant progress in the identification of x - ray undetected ( potentially compton thick ) agns has been made using _",
    "observations of @xmath0  2 massive galaxies ( e.g. ,  daddi et  al . 2007 ;",
    "fiore et  al .",
    "for example , selecting galaxies with excess ir emission over that expected from star - formation activity ( on the basis of absorption - corrected uv emission ) , daddi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) revealed a large population of x - ray undetected ir - luminous galaxies with either extreme dust - obscured star formation or agn activity . using x - ray stacking analyses , daddi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that , although individual galaxies were not detected in the x - ray band , the average stacked x - ray spectral slope is flat ( @xmath27  0.9 ) .",
    "such a flat x - ray spectral slope unambiguously indicates the presence of heavily obscured agn activity in many systems , some of which may be obscured by compton - thick material .",
    "the work of daddi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and fiore et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) undoubtably provide important constraints on the space density of the most heavily obscured agns , and therefore of the most heavily obscured phases of smbh growth .",
    "however , since these studies were based on x - ray stacking analyses there are significant uncertainties on ( 1 ) the fraction of obscured agns that are contributing to the stacked hard x - ray spectral slope ( e.g. ,  donley et  al .",
    "2008 ) , ( 2 ) the intrinsic luminosities of the agns , and ( 3 ) the fraction of the agns that are compton thick , since both compton - thin and compton - thick agns can have flat x - ray spectral slopes . using the latest 2  ms _ chandra _ observations of the cdf - s ( luo et  al .",
    "2008 ) , we have been able to place constraints on issues ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) by detecting individual agns that were contributing to the stack in daddi et  al .",
    "this new analysis has shown that the fraction of obscured agns contributing to the x - ray stacking results is at least @xmath4  25% , and that the agns have a broad range of luminosities from @xmath28  erg  s@xmath7 ( alexander et  al . 2009 ) . however , without spectroscopic data , none of these studies are able to reliably determine how many of the agns are compton thick ( issue 3 ) .",
    "the robust identification of distant compton - thick agns requires good quality spectra in addition to continuum observations . in alexander",
    "( 2008b ) we made great strides in this direction by identifying luminous agns in seven x - ray weak / undetected @xmath0  2 galaxies with agn signatures from optical and/or mid - ir ( _ spitzer_-irs ) spectroscopy .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the agns in these galaxies could be estimated _ both _ from agn - dominated optical emission lines and agn - dominated mid - ir emission ( distinguished from star formation processes using mid - ir spectroscopy ) , giving @xmath29@xmath30  erg  s@xmath7 ( i.e. ,  luminous agn activity ) . by comparison ,",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities are @xmath4  23 orders of magnitude lower than those predicted , indicating that the x - ray emission _ must _ be obscured by compton - thick material ; see fig .  2 and  3 in alexander et  al .",
    "( 2008b ) . with these diagnostics",
    "it is therefore possible to identify distant compton - thick agns in the absence of good - quality x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "although limited in source statistics , the alexander et  al .",
    "( 2008b ) study was also able to place basic constraints on the space density of luminous compton - thick agns ( @xmath31  erg  s@xmath7 ) at @xmath0  22.5 .",
    "the derived space density of ( 0.72.5)@xmath32  mpc@xmath33 is consistent with that found for comparably luminous unobscured agns , indicating that compton - thick smbh growth was as ubiquitious as unobscured smbh growth in the distant universe .",
    "however , since our method relied on the identification of optical emission lines , these constraints should be considered a lower limit on the compton - thick agn space density as there are likely to also be many compton - thick agns with weak optical emission lines ( e.g. ,  ngc  6240 in the local universe ) .",
    "the compton - thick agns spectroscopically identified in alexander et  al .",
    "( 2008b ) are more luminous than the agns studied in daddi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and fiore et  al .",
    "however , this is clearly a selection effect since in order to infer that the x - ray emission from the agns in alexander et  al .",
    "( 2008b ) is obscured by compton - thick material , it was necessary to select the most luminous agns ; i.e. ,  given an x - ray sensitivity limit of @xmath4  10@xmath3410@xmath22  erg  s@xmath7 , only objects with intrinsic x - ray luminosities @xmath35  erg  s@xmath7 could be reliably identified as compton thick .",
    "from a combination of x - ray , ir , and submm data with optical and mid - ir spectroscopy , we have been able to provide sensitive constraints on the ubiquity and properties of agn activity in @xmath0  2 dust - obscured galaxies .",
    "can we use these constraints along with other multi - wavelength data to understand the relative smbh ",
    "stellar growth in @xmath0  2 galaxies ?",
    "interestingly we can .",
    "the deep multi - wavelength of smgs show that these @xmath0  2 galaxies host both heavily obscured agn and star formation activity ; see  2 .",
    "qualitatively , this joint smbh  stellar growth is consistent with that expected given the smbh  spheroid mass relationship in the local universe .",
    "however , constraints on the masses of the smbh and spheroid suggest that the smbhs in smgs may be smaller than that expected given the lcoal smbh ",
    "spheroid mass constraints , indicating that the smbh may be `` catching up '' with the growth of the smbh ( see alexander et  al .",
    ". the estimated growth rate of the smbhs in smgs do not appear to be sufficient to significantly overcome the growth rate of the spheroid , indicating that a more agn - dominated growth phase may be required to place smgs ( and their progeny ) on the locally defined smbh ",
    "spheroid mass relationship ( e.g. ,  an optically bright quasar ; coppin et  al .",
    "although these constraints suggest that there is a `` lag '' in the smbh growth in smgs , given that smgs are amongst the most rapidly evolving galaxies in the universe , it is perhaps surprising that the relative smbh  galaxy spheroid growth rate in these systems is even _",
    "approximately _ in agreement with that expected from the smbh  spheroid mass relationship .",
    "this may indicate that some kind of regulatory mechanism is at work to `` control '' the growth of these two components ( i.e. ,  energetic winds / outflows ) .",
    "the constraints on the smbh  galaxy growth in the @xmath0  2 _ spitzer_-detected galaxies studied by daddi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) are weaker than those determined for @xmath0  2 smgs since they are typically less luminous ( and therefore fainter ) . however , based on the analyses of daddi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and murphy et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , there is clear evidence for both agn activity and star formation in many of these systems . by decomposing the ir spectral energy distributions of the _ spitzer_-detected galaxies into agn and star - formation components , daddi et  al .",

    "stellar growth in these galaxies is consistent with that expected given the local smbh  spheroid mass relationship . the @xmath0  2 _ spitzer_-detected galaxies are growing less rapidly than the @xmath0  2 smgs , and are therefore are less likely to be able to significantly deviate from the local smbh  spheroid mass relationship .",
