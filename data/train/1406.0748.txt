    "gives a non  trivial contribution to the energy at order @xmath0 , or in the language of feynman diagrams , at one loop . as is common for loop diagrams , ultra ",
    "violet divergences occur in this calculation .",
    "it is essential that these divergences are unambiguously canceled by fixed counterterms whose coefficients do not depend on the specification of the background . in the case of",
    "_ static _ backgrounds whose interactions with quantum fields do not involve the conjugate momenta of these fields , spectral methods are well known to accomplish this task @xcite .",
    "this formalism is well founded in quantum field theory @xcite . for completeness we will provide a more heuristic derivation in this introduction , based on techniques from quantum mechanics , and review the essentials of the quantum field theory derivation in section ii .",
    "the main goal of this paper , however , is to explore the spectral method in cases where the interaction is _ frequency dependent _ , and to discuss the possible modifications necessary to handle such cases .    as mentioned earlier , it is necessary to sum the changes in the zero  point energies due to the interaction with the background .",
    "there are two types of energy eigenstates that lead to zero point energies ,",
    "( i ) bound states with discrete eigenvalues @xmath1 and ( ii ) continuum states with the dispersion relation @xmath2 or @xmath3 for non  relativistic and relativistic theories , respectively . ] . here",
    "@xmath4 is the asymptotic wave  number of the quantum fluctuation and @xmath5 is its mass . since there are no bound states ( b.s . ) without the background , the bound states contribute just @xmath6 to the vacuum polarization energy .",
    "the continuum piece is often expressed as an integral over the frequency weighted by the change of the density of states , @xmath7 , caused by the interaction . in order to find @xmath7 ,",
    "boundary conditions far away from the interaction regime are imposed to discretize and count the states .",
    "eventually this boundary is sent to infinity . far away from the interaction regime ,",
    "however , all information about the background is encoded in the phase shift @xmath8 that the interaction imprints on the quantum fluctuation .",
    "a typical boundary condition is then of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 refers to the position of the boundary . counting the states",
    "is then as simple are demanding that @xmath11 .",
    "the density of states is the derivative @xmath12 giving @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",

    "we have indicated the subtraction of the first @xmath16 terms of the born series from the phase shift .",
    "the born series orders scattering data according to increasing powers of the background interaction and may be constructed by iterating the wave  equation .",
    "the same expansion can be alternatively formulated in terms of feynman diagrams , and @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) adds back in exactly what the born terms subtracted .",
    "if @xmath16 is large enough the momentum integral will be finite , and the sum @xmath18 can be regularized and renormalized by standard techniques from perturbative field theory .",
    "we stress that the born and feynman expansions have solely been introduced to identify and eventually cancel the ultra  violet divergences .",
    "this does not imply that these series are good approximations to the ( one  loop ) vacuum polarization energy ; they might , in fact , not even converge .",
    "the spectral method sketched above has proven to be a very versatile tool to compute vacuum energies in sufficiently symmetric static backgrounds .",
    "it has been extended successfully to a wide range of situations , from cosmic strings @xcite over soliton stabilization @xcite to interfaces and extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the krein  friedel ",
    "lloyd formula has been the basis of many studies of quantum corrections to classical soliton energies ; see for example one dimensional models in refs.@xcite or the three dimensional skyrme model in refs.@xcite .",
    "the above heuristic derivation shows that in order to find the density of states and thus the vacuum polarization energy , we must compare modes with different ( albeit infinitesimally close ) frequencies .",
    "thus it is not at all obvious that the above argument for the density of states carries through when the interaction with the background becomes frequency dependent .",
    "this question arises irrespective of whether or not the field equations are diagonal in the frequency .",
    "furthermore we have assumed that each mode contributes exactly @xmath19 .",
    "effective action arguments suggest that this assumption essentially boils down to the statement that even with the frequency dependent interaction included the energy of the static background is still the negative of its lagrange function .",
    "this statement can undergoes modifications when the interaction involves a time derivative of the quantum field . here",
    "we will consider a variety of models with frequency dependent interactions and study whether and under what conditions the above simple description for the vacuum energy can be maintained .    in the next section we review the quantum field theory derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) for static interactions .",
    "subsequently we investigate the modifications necessary for a number of examples with frequency dependent interactions . the simplest model that leads to a frequency dependent interaction is the gauge invariant coupling of a scalar field to a static electromagnetic background . in section iii we study this example and find that computing its vacuum polarization energy does not require any approximation and , furthermore , that eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) holds without modification .",
    "frequency dependent interactions also emerge in effective theories that result from integrating out some of the degrees of freedom .",
    "such a scenario is often encountered in particle physics .",
    "typically , a local energy density and a scattering problem can only be formulated in the effective theory once certain approximations are performed .",
    "but even with such approximations , frequency dependence must be retained to account for renormalizability . in the specific example of section iv we will see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) is also valid without modifications .",
    "however , it is essential to consistently approximate both the wave  equations and the energy density when constructing the effective theory .    in both examples we will observe that indeed significant changes to the energy density and the scattering data occur when frequency dependent interaction are involved .",
    "these changes tend to cancel , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) remains correct in such cases .",
    "however , the necessary cancellations of non  standard contributions involving the background potential are very delicate , and it is by no means obvious that the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) without modifications will succeed in _ all _ cases .",
    "in section v we will study the important problem of electrodynamics in a dielectric .",
    "for the casimir problem to remain under control in the ultraviolet , we must have a frequency  dependent dielectric function .",
    "in order to obey the kramers - kronig relations , such a dielectric must include dissipation , which in the casimir problem represents a coupling of electromagnetic fluctuations to fluctuations in the microscopic matter degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite formulate the casimir energy in this case as an ensemble average in _ statistical mechanics_. in this approach the standard expression for the energy in a dielectric is identified from a calculation of the free energy .",
    "when translated intro scattering theory , it induces extra terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "these terms can play an important role in determining the sign of the casimir self ",
    "stress @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can consider a dielectric without dissipation , in which case the problem can be formulated within _ field theory _ , at the cost of violation of the kramers  kronig relations . in this case , one obtains a different expression for the ( now conserved ) energy , one that has been obtained previously in classical electromagnetism as an approximation at frequencies where dissipation is negligible @xcite , and that has also been discussed in the context of casimir calculations @xcite .",
    "notably , this form of the energy has the effect of exactly canceling the extra terms appearing in eq .",

    "employs the conventional expression for the energy with a constant dielectric ( type ( @xmath261 ) ) , which leads to extra terms in our spectral analysis , while the unconventional form ( @xmath263 ) , that one obtains in the former case , does not .",
