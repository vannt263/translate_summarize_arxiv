    "whether one uses hadronic language involving some set of baryons and mesons or qcd language with quarks and gluons , the nucleon is not a point dirac particle , but has spatial extension .",
    "its properties may be described , in a large part , in terms of a set of elastic electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 arising in em elastic electron scattering from protons and neutrons , @xmath5 arising when the weak interaction plays a role , together with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the strangeness form factors which may play a role in parity - violating elastic electron scattering . in this paper",
    "we focus on the first four , the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton and neutron . clearly having a detailed understanding of all of the form factors of the nucleon constitutes a major goal in physics .",
    "these are central to our understanding of strongly - coupled qcd and form the building blocks for much of what is done in exploring the electroweak structure of nuclei .    in experimental studies",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of the proton have traditionally been extracted using the rosenbluth equation for elastic electron scattering from hydrogen , _",
    "i.e. _ with no polarization information ( no polarized electrons , no polarized hydrogen target , no measurement of the recoiling proton polarization )",
    ". the rosenbluth differential cross section may be written as : @xmath8   \\label{eq : sig0}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the dimensionless 4-momentum transfer and @xmath10^{-1 }   \\label{eq : longpol}\\ ] ] is the so - called virtual photon polarization , governing the balance between longitudinal and transverse responses .",
    "the factor @xmath11 is the mott cross section  @xcite , _ i.e. _ the cross section for scattering from structureless fermions . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0 ] ) it has been assumed that the one - photon - exchange approximation is valid . in principle , by varying the electron scattering angle @xmath12 at fixed @xmath13 , one can separate @xmath1 from @xmath3 . at low @xmath0",
    "this is the usual procedure ; however , at high @xmath0 typically the term involving the magnetic form factor dominates , with the term involving the electric form factor contributing only at the few percent level .",
    "effects beyond the one - photon - exchange approximation are thought to play a significant role  @xcite and thereby modify eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0 ] ) from its standard rosenbluth form . at low @xmath0",
    "the present understanding is that such contributions provide relatively small corrections , and thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0 ] ) is a reasonably good approximation . in contrast , at high @xmath0 this is not believed to be the case , making relatively large corrections necessary before @xmath1 can be extracted using the rosenbluth cross section .",
    "a simple estimate can help to make this clear . defining the ratio @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( see discussions in sect .  [",
    "sec : momspace ] ) , the rosenbluth cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0 ] ) is seen to be proportional to @xmath16 . using either the model to be discussed in the next section or the data in the following section",
    ", one finds that at @xmath17 ( gev / c)@xmath18 one has @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , in the latter case the second term ( the one containing @xmath20 ) is only about 1% of the first term , namely , about @xmath21 ; as a consequence it is not surprising that higher - order qed corrections play a role .",
    "this issue will be definitively resolved when new measurements are made using both electrons and positrons to exploit the sign change that occurs in the interference between one and two - photon exchange contributions when the lepton sign is reversed .",
    "experiments are planned or in progress to address these issues at jlab , novosibirsk and desy(olympus ) . in recent decades",
    "new approaches have been used to separate @xmath1 from @xmath3 , namely by using polarized electrons and either polarized hydrogen targets , @xmath22 , or by measuring the recoil polarization of the proton in the final state after the elastic scattering , @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , for the polarized electron / polarized target case one has @xmath24",
    "\\label{eq : sigpol}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the longitudinal electron polarization , @xmath26 is a vector pointing in the direction characterized by the angles @xmath27 in a coordinate system with z - axis along the virtual photon direction and with the normal to the electron scattering plane lying along the y - axis ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization information is contained in the product @xmath28 and clearly by flipping the electron s helicity and/or the target s spin and choosing the target polarization to lie in at least two different directions it is possible , at least in principle , to separate the interference @xmath29 from the term having @xmath30 .",
    "experimentally it is clearly advantageous to form a ratio of the result given above for two choices of polarization directions , say @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 when , as is typically done , the choice is made to employ parallel ( @xmath34 : @xmath35 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath36 : @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) kinematics , this provides a way to determine the ratio of the form factors : @xmath39 similar expressions occur when measuring the recoil polarization ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "analogous studies whose goal is to extract the form factors of the neutron must generally be undertaken by electron scattering from few - body nuclei . in particular , inclusive quasi - elastic scattering of polarized electrons from polarized @xmath40he , namely , @xmath41 , and semi - inclusive quasi - elastic scattering of polarized electrons from either polarized deuterons or @xmath40he , namely , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , or with polarization transfer to final - state neutrons , @xmath44 ,",
    "have all been used to provide effectively elastic electron scattering from neutrons , _",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "naturally , in these cases some corrections for nuclear physics effects must be made .",
    "the separation of the neutron electromagnetic form factors benefits in two ways from the use of polarized data .",
    "not only is the sensitivity to two - photon corrections decreased , but also some of the nuclear model dependence cancels in the form factor ratio .",
    "note that , since the form factors occur as interferences in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polpiece ] ) and therefore one is not at high @xmath0 comparing a very small contribution ( @xmath47 ) with a very large contribution ( @xmath48 ) as occurs in the rosenbluth cross section , it is believed that one is not as sensitive to higher - order corrections beyond the one - photon - exchange approximation .",
    "this is borne out in modeling of the two - photon effects  @xcite which indicate that the rosenbluth cross section is problematical in this regard , as mentioned above , but that these corrections are relatively much less important for the extraction of the form factor ratio using polarization observables and that , accordingly , using polarization degrees of freedom in elastic ep scattering can provide a clean separation of the form factors . again , to make this clear , let us use the simple estimate as above .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polpiece ] ) is proportional to @xmath49 and thus , even at @xmath50 ( gev / c)@xmath18 where @xmath51 was seen to be about 0.1 , the first term ( for @xmath52 not too small ) is typically 10% of the second and higher - order @xmath53 qed corrections probably make less of an impact on the extraction of the form factor ratio .    on the theoretical side , exact _ ab initio _ qcd calculations of @xmath54 using lattice techniques",
    "will eventually be possible .",
    "however , despite the fact that very encouraging results have been obtained in recent work  @xcite , a fully quantitative understanding of the entire set of form factors is lacking at present .",
    "given this , alternative approaches are typically taken .",
    "for example , light - front methods , quark descriptions and chiral invariance have been employed by miller to obtain qualitative relations and semi - quantitative descriptions of various aspects of the form factors in both momentum and configuration space  @xcite .    in the present work we draw upon results from form factor models which use as hadronic building blocks vector mesons together with coupling to the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 continua as given by dispersion relation calculations  the so - called vector meson dominance plus dispersion relation based models ( vmd+dr )  @xcite .",
    "the most recent versions of these models have been quite successful in representing the momentum - space content in the form factors , _",
    "i.e. , _ the behaviors of the form factors as functions of 4-momentum transfer squared , especially the models which also incorporate ingredients that provide the correct asymptotic behavior as @xmath58 ( see sect .  [ sec : vmd ] ) .",
    "for instance , as discussed in more detail later , one sees that , in some cases , cancellations of various vector meson contributions can lead to a dipole - like @xmath0-dependence , which is in good agreement with the nucleon s magnetic form factors for @xmath59  ( gev / c)@xmath18 .",
    "the proton s electric form factor is known to fall faster than dipole and , in fact , even the earliest vmd+dr models  @xcite showed this behavior although the available data did not . at low @xmath0",
    "the neutron s electric form factor has a different form from the proton s , since the net charge in the neutron is zero ; again the polarization data and vmd+dr approaches yield a @xmath0-dependence for @xmath2 which is only in rough accord over the current experimental range with the commonly used dipole type approximation , namely , the galster form  @xcite . in the most recent fits , such as in  @xcite where the high-@xmath0 behavior predicted by perturbative qcd is enforced , all four of the nucleon s electromagnetic form factors are very well represented , showing the experimentally indicated deviations from the dipole or galster forms .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : vmd ] .",
    "additionally , a few remarks will be made there concerning the differences between the vmd+dr approach with hadronic form factors used here for comparison with data  @xcite and a version without such form factors where instead one adds effective vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "in addition to discussing the form factors in sect .  [ sec : vmd ] , both the measured quantities and the vmd+dr modeling , _",
    "i.e. _ the momentum - space content , we also discuss results in coordinate space ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : coord ] ) with the goal being to obtain additional insights both into the various representations of the data ( p versus n , @xmath60 versus @xmath61 , isoscalar versus isovector , u - quark versus d - quark ) and into the roles being played by the various ingredients in the vmd+dr approach ( the different vector mesons , the role of the coupling to the continuum , the nature of terms that yield the asymptotic behavior ) .",

[",
    "sec : concl ] conclusions resulting from this study are summarized .",
    "given the brief introductory discussions in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] to place the general problem in context , let us now summarize the ingredients in the basic model employed in the present work .",
    "we consider only the vmd+dr approach , as this provides a reasonably successful representation of the nucleon s electromagnetic form factors .",
    "we start by summarizing some of the basic formulas needed in the discussions to follow . in particular ,",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of a nucleon are defined via the expression for the electromagnetic current matrix element @xmath63u(p)\\ , ,   \\label{eq : curr}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( in the space - like regime ) is the square of the invariant momentum transfer , @xmath66 is the neutron , @xmath67 , or proton , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively the dirac and pauli form factors , normalized at @xmath71 : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the anomalous magnetic moments for the proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "the sachs form factors , most directly obtained from experiment , are then @xmath78 and the combinations measured by the polarization experiments are @xmath79 the isoscalar and isovector form factors are , respectively @xmath80    electrons couple through photons to the electromagnetic currents provided by the hadron and quark distributions within the nucleons , yielding the form factors introduced above . because the photon is a vector particle , at any parity - conserving vertex where it couples with hadrons it must connect to these hadrons with unit total angular momentum and negative parity",
    ". the photon does not conserve isospin and so these systems of hadrons may be isoscalar or isovector .",
    "the simplest such vertex connects the photon to a single vector meson ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ,  ) .",
    "it can also couple to systems of two or three pions or @xmath84 in a @xmath85 state , which in turn may couple to a @xmath81 , @xmath82 or @xmath83-type meson . since the latter are resonances of the multi - meson systems , the strength of the interaction is largest close to the masses of the vector mesons . in leading order",
    "this is the vmd limit of the photon - hadron interaction  @xcite which will be seen to give a good representation of the data over most of the present range of momentum transfers ( see below ) .",
    "however , small but significant corrections can be expected from multi - pion correlations in the continuum , such as those that give the @xmath81 meson its width .",
    "these contributions can be calculated using dispersion relations with input from meson - meson scattering . at sufficiently high momentum transfers , as perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) becomes a better approximation than effective hadrons , photons coupling to quarks provides a better description and the models must asymptotically have a pqcd behavior .",
    "this transition is handled in various ways by the models , as discussed later .",
    "the earliest reasonable fit to the available nucleon form factor data was a vmd model  @xcite of iachello , jackson and lande with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 vector meson poles .",
    "they incorporated a single meson / nuclear vertex form factor for all terms , using various forms that cut - off at high momentum transfer ( but none decreased as rapidly as pqcd ) .",
    "the width of the rho - meson was included by modifying the pole term with a form suggested by frazer and fulco  @xcite . a more recent paper by bijker and iachello  @xcite adds an asymptotic term to the pauli - isovector current and modifies the hadronic form factor to include the asymptotic logarithmic q dependence . after refitting parameters to a larger set of data ,",
    "the neutron form factors are substantially improved at the expense of a small worsening in the fit to the proton form factors compared with earlier fit  @xcite .",
    "shortly after  @xcite hhler and collaborators  @xcite used dispersion relations to obtain the contribution of the @xmath86 continuum giving the @xmath81 meson its width , which they fitted with a simple function of the mass ( eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) of that reference ) .",
    "the @xmath82 and @xmath83 mesons and several phenomenological vector mesons were represented by simple poles .",
    "they did not introduce form factors at the strong vertices .",
    "instead the phenomenological constants ( pole masses and residues ) were restricted by conditions of super - convergent behavior at asymptotic momentum transfers in addition to being optimized to fit the data .",
    "this required the addition of unknown vector meson pole terms .    recently",
    "meissner and collaborators  @xcite have extended the hhler type model by considering , in addition to the @xmath86 continuum , the @xmath87 and @xmath88 continua , which they find are adequately represented by simple poles .",
    "they also added phenomenological vector meson poles and a broad phenomenological contribution to each isovector form factor at higher masses .",
    "as before , there are no strong vertex form factors and the asymptotic momentum transfer behavior is obtained by requiring a cancellation amongst all of the terms to obtain super - convergence in one fit , and an explicit pqcd behavior in another version .",
    "gari and krmpelmann ( gk )  @xcite proposed a model in which vmd at low momentum transfers was replaced by pqcd at high momentum transfers , using differing convergence rates of hadronic and quark form factors .",
    "[ also ref .",
    "@xcite from earlier . ]",
    "they obtained a good fit to the data then available using only the @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 vector meson poles .",
    "the hadronic ( quark ) form factors are required by the strong renormalization corrections at the vector meson / nucleon ( quark ) vertices .",
    "the @xmath83 meson - nucleon hadronic form factor has been constructed imposing the zweig rule required by the @xmath89 quark structure of that meson .",
    "the inclusion of these vertex form factors was crucial in enabling the evolution with momentum transfer to the pqcd behavior without an artificial constraint on the relation between the vector meson pole parameters .",
    "as an added indication of the validity of this approach , there was no need for adding several phenomenological vector meson poles at masses in disagreement with available data .",
    "the physical realism of this model was enhanced by lomon  @xcite by incorporating the following modifications :    * the width of the @xmath81 meson was included using the dispersion calculation of  @xcite ; * the observed @xmath90 ( 1.45 gev )  @xcite and @xmath91 ( 1.419 gev )  @xcite vector meson poles were included ; * in  @xcite and later the quark - nucleon vertex form factor uses the quark - nucleon cut - off , instead of the meson - nucleon cut - off used by gk .",
    "also the vector meson - hadron form factors of gk ( model 1 ) were used as being more consistent with the helicity flip in the pauli terms . in both cases the logarithmic dependence",
    "is determined by @xmath92 , which is fixed near the value determined by high - energy data .",
    "these yielded the so - called gkex ( gari - krmpelmann extended ) models used in the present work .",
    "in particular , we employ the model given in  @xcite as the basis for the present studies .",
    "note that our motivation in the present work is not so much to elaborate the fitting procedures discussed in  @xcite , but to take as given that study and use the model discussed there to gain a deeper understanding of some of the systematics seen in the data .",
    "no attempt is made in the present work to provide new fits to the data after 2005 , since the world database is soon to be extended  the form factor representations are frozen , using the one specific contemporary vmd+dr model denoted gkex  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we wish to obtain better insight into why the @xmath93 form factors are roughly dipole in character , while @xmath1 is not , and falls faster than dipole .",
    "we shall see that this difference in behavior emerges naturally in the context of the models discussed .",
    "furthermore , the most modern models of the type employed here are actual hybrids containing hadronic ingredients as well as terms which have the correct pqcd behaviors when @xmath0 becomes large . within these models",
    "one can ask where the cross - over to this asymptotic behavior occurs .    the gkex model of  @xcite",
    "is summarized in the following .",

    "the value of @xmath106 is experimentally determined from the meson decay to @xmath107 .    for completeness we briefly summarize the procedures used in  @xcite to determine the model parameters .",
    "specifically , the 2001 version of the gkex model , which did not include the @xmath91 meson , was fitted to all of the unpolarized , rosenbluth - separated cross section data , and included the then - available @xmath108 polarization data , although in the absence of @xmath109 data .",

    "all of these are discussed in more detail below .    in context , note that a compromise is sometimes employed , that of fourier transforming to coordinate space only with respect to the transverse directions ( orthogonal to the boost ) , but leaving the third dimension in momentum space , thereby having a mixed representation  @xcite .",
    "while avoiding some of the inevitable problems discussed below , the nucleon s properties are harder to envision in this approach .    when choosing to represent the nucleon s properties one may choose any frame of reference , for instance , the initial - state rest frame , the final - state rest frame , choices in between or frames boosted to the light - cone .",

    "these become equal when @xmath209 gev / c , and thus one must expect functional dependence at even higher momentum transfers or , corresponding , smaller distance scales to lie beyond simplistic non - relativistic intuition . at lower momentum transfers  corresponding to distance scales significantly larger than the nucleon s compton wavelength  there may be some validity to the interpretation of the coordinate - space distributions as charge or spin distributions .",

    "( 28 , 29 ) ) , we fit the data to two orthogonal basis functions .",
    "the first is the fourier - bessel expansion ( fbe ) , the wave functions of an infinite spherical well of radius @xmath223 in position space , @xmath224 these functions are localized in frequency , peaking at @xmath225 , with a hard cutoff at the @xmath67-th zero of the @xmath226 spherical bessel function @xmath227 at @xmath223 .",
    "the second is the laguerre - gaussian expansion ( lge ) , the wave functions of a spherical harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath228 for fixed parameter @xmath229 , @xmath230 where @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 is a generalized laguerre function .",
    "these functions are localized in neither position nor momentum .",
    "the width of the basis functions is not fixed in coordinate space , but increases with @xmath67 as @xmath234 .",
    "higher - order functions emphasize larger values of both @xmath214 and @xmath235 .",
    "these two basis sets have quite complementary features ; so it should be clear by comparing results from the two expansions which parts depend on the particular basis set used and which are model - independent . in this paper , relativistic corrections to the form factors or to @xmath236",
    "are not considered as they were in  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of sources of uncertainty in the fits , which are interrelated .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 of the data limits the maximum number , @xmath66 , of basis functions which can be fit for fixed @xmath223 or @xmath229 .",
    "the @xmath0 range of each basis function depends on @xmath237 or @xmath229 so a larger number of basis functions can be used by increasing the size of the box .",
    "however the box size is limited by the @xmath0 gaps in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 database . with the appropriate box size",
    ", @xmath66 is ultimately limited by the finite number of form factor measurements at independent values of @xmath0 .",
    "if one tries to use more basis functions , the fit parameters will become highly correlated , manifest by a large error band . even below this limit ,",
    "as @xmath66 increases there are fewer data per fit parameter , and so the error should grow as @xmath238 .",
    "this increase in error is offset by the extra information obtained in higher spatial frequencies .",
    "the truncation error from omitting higher frequencies is represented below with a horizontal error bar of width @xmath239 , a quarter wavelength of the highest frequency basis function .",
    "this is an overestimate , since the form factors fall off rapidly with @xmath0 .    with the small number of basis functions ( n=78 ) afforded by the data , it is difficult to obtain convergence to @xmath240 .",
    "better convergence can be obtained while retaining the model independence by fitting only the residual form factors after subtracting an arbitrary base function which reproduces the general features of the data .",
    "we used the gkex model as the base function .",
    "the fbe or lge expansion is used to fit the small correction to gkex from the data , and mainly to calculate the model - independent error band of the fourier transform .",
    "the quality of the base function can be assessed by comparing the residual fit with the size of the error band .",
    "the model independence can be shown by comparing the fbe and lge expansions , and by using different base functions .    in general , the widths of the error bands of the fits to @xmath241 were linear in @xmath214 , superimposed with an oscillation due to truncation after a finite number of the basis functions .",
    "the oscillations were approximately the frequency of the highest basis function .",
    "the linear part was consistent between the fbe and lge residual fits , but not the oscillations .",
    "the oscillations were small for reasonable values of @xmath66 , but started to dominate as too many basis functions were used .",
    "only the linear part of the error bands were used in the final plots .",
    "the complete procedure used to determine the optimal values of the non - fit parameters @xmath242 or @xmath243 in the fourier transform of the data is as follows .",
    "the residual @xmath240 data after subtracting the gkex model were fit to a series of @xmath66 basis functions , either fbe or lge .",
    "the width of the error band was fit to the linear function @xmath244 1  fm , and then @xmath245 was plotted as a function of the number of basis functions used each fit .",
    "a series of such plots @xmath246 was generated for data subsets with different cuts of the form @xmath247 .",
    "the values @xmath248 = 0.1 , 0.4 , 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 , and 6.0  ( gev / c)@xmath18 for the proton and @xmath248 = 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5  ( gev / c)@xmath18 for the neutron were used to generate the series of plots . at small @xmath66 , @xmath249 was the same for each value of @xmath248 .",
    "as @xmath66 increased , @xmath249 began to diverge for data sets with lower values of @xmath248 .",
    "the threshold of @xmath66 where the fits began to diverge indicated the maximum number of basis functions feasible for each @xmath0 range , @xmath250 .",
    "the @xmath0 range was fixed at @xmath251 = 1.5  ( gev / c)@xmath18 for comparison of @xmath252 and @xmath253 and to avoid issues of two photon contributions .",
    "the entire procedure was repeated with different box sizes @xmath223 ( fbe ) or @xmath229 ( lge ) .",
    "the values @xmath223 and @xmath229 were chosen to minimize @xmath254 . as one would expect , the optimal box size was the same for the proton and neutron .",
