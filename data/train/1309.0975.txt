    "the present work is inspired by the work of barberis @xcite where invariant hypercomplex structures @xmath0 on 4-dimensional real lie groups are classified . in that case",
    "the corresponding metric is positive definite and hermitian with respect to the triplet of complex structures of @xmath0 .",
    "our main goal is to classify 4-dimensional real lie algebras which admit hypercomplex structures with hermitian and norden metrics .",
    "we equip a hypercomplex structure @xmath0 with a metric structure , generated by a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath1 of neutral signature ( see @xcite ) . in our case the one ( resp . , the other two ) of the almost complex structures of @xmath0 acts as an isometry ( resp . , act as anti - isometries ) with respect to @xmath1 in each tangent fibre .",
    "thus , there exist three ( 0,2)-tensors associated by @xmath0 except the metric @xmath1  a khler form and two metrics of the same type .",
    "the metric @xmath1 is hermitian with respect to the one almost complex structure of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is a norden ( i.e. an anti - hermitian ) metric regarding the other two almost complex structures of @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason we call the derived almost hypercomplex structure an _ almost hypercomplex structure with hermitian - norden - metrics _ or briefly _ almost hypercomplex hn - metric structure_.    let us remark that in @xcite and @xcite are classified the invariant complex structures on 4-dimensional solvable simply - connected real lie groups where the dimension of commutators is less than three and equal three , respectively .",
    "a hypercomplex structure is called _ abelian _ ( @xcite ) if @xmath2 = [ x , y]$ ] , for all @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "abelian hypercomplex structures are considered in @xcite , @xcite and they can only occur on solvable lie algebras ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the condition @xmath5-j[jx , y]-j[x , jy]-[x , y]=0 $ ] can be rewritten as @xmath6-[x , y ] = j([jx , y]+[x , jy])$ ] for all @xmath3 .",
    "thus , abelian complex structures and therefore abelian hypercomplex structure are integrable .",
    "if the three almost complex structures of @xmath0 are parallel with respect to the levi - civita connection @xmath7 of @xmath1 then such hypercomplex hn - manifolds of khler type we call _ hyper - khler hn - manifolds _ , which are flat according to @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec1 ] we recall some facts about the almost hypercomplex hn - manifolds known from @xcite . in sect .  [ sec2 ] we construct different types of hypercomplex structures on lie algebras following the barberis classification .",
    "the basic problem of this work is the existence and the geometric characteristics of hypercomplex hn - structures on 4-dimensional lie algebras according to the barberis classification .",
    "the main results of this paper is construction of the different types of the considered structures and their characterization .",
    "let @xmath8 be a hypercomplex manifold , i.e. @xmath9 is a @xmath10-dimensional differentiable manifold and @xmath11 is a triple of complex structures on @xmath9 with the following properties for all cyclic permutations @xmath12 of @xmath13:@xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the identity and moreover , it is valid @xmath16 for the nijenhuis tensors @xmath17 of @xmath18 given by @xmath19      -j_{\\alpha}\\left[j_{\\alpha}\\cdot,\\cdot \\right ]      -j_{\\alpha}\\left[\\cdot , j_{\\alpha}\\cdot \\right ]      -\\left[\\cdot,\\cdot \\right]\\]]on @xmath20 . a hypercomplex structure on a lie group @xmath21 is said to be _ invariant _ if left translations by elements of @xmath21 are holomorphic with respect to @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath24 is the corresponding lie algebra of the lie group @xmath21 , a hypercomplex structure on @xmath24 induces an invariant hypercomplex structure on @xmath21 by left translations .",
    "let @xmath21 be a simply connected 4-dimensional real lie group admitting an invariant hypercomplex structure .",
    "a left invariant metric on @xmath21 is called invariant hyper - hermitian if it is hyper - hermitian with respect to some invariant hypercomplex structure on @xmath21 .",
