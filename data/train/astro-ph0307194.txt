    "with our rapidly expanding knowledge of the galactic center ( see , e.g. , melia 1999 ) , we now have a real hope of unraveling how the blrs in agns are produced , and how they evolve spatially and temporally .",
    "an understanding of the structure of the blr in turn is important in determining how the gaseous environment behaves near the central engine , presumably a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , in these sources . unlike the galactic center , however , where we know the mass very accurately ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , we do not yet have a reliable estimate of @xmath0 for these objects .",
    "but since all of the relevant length scales depend on the central mass , one may reasonably expect that a careful modeling of these environments with temporally resolved line profiles can provide us with a tightly constrained range of values for @xmath0 .",
    "reverberation methods ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have become popular tools for estimating the blr size in agns .",
    "the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) centroid @xmath4 for a given line , typically measured in days , represents a delay between a change in the continuum flux and a corresponding ( presumably causal ) change in the line flux . from it",
    ", we can infer the responsivity - weighted mean radius , @xmath5 , of the line - emitting gas , assuming the delay is due to light - travel time effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we make the very reasonable assumption that the central mass dominates the motion of the blr gas , the velocity dispersion @xmath6 of this line can then be used to estimate the central mass , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a corrective factor of order unity representing our uncertainty in the geometry and isotropy of the blr .",
    "an example of how this works in a simplified case , where the velocity distribution of the gas is such that the line profile in the root mean square ( rms ) spectrum assumes a roughly gaussian shape , has recently been studied by peterson & wandel ( 1999 ) . using the uv and optical data for ngc  5548 from the extensive monitoring campaigns conducted by the agn watch consortium ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , they computed the rms spectrum from the set of individual spectra .",
    "the line profiles in the rms spectrum represent those portions of the emission lines that are actually varying in response to the continuum fluctuations , and therefore correspond to the ccf measurements . using this method ,",
    "the fwhm of each line is measured directly from the line profile , and a velocity dispersion is calculated according to the relation @xmath9 .",
    "using the reported values of @xmath4 , they obtained a central mass in this source of @xmath10 .",
    "however , although estimating the velocity dispersion from the fwhm is valid in the case of a gaussian or other regular ( e.g. , laplacian ) line profile , this method can not be used in the general case where the line profile is highly irregular . in this paper , we introduce a more generally applicable method to calculate the velocity dispersion directly , and show that our results agree with the fwhm procedure in the limit of a gaussian profile .",
    "we avoid the simplifying assumptions concerning the line shape , which allows us to significantly broaden the class of objects for which the central mass may be estimated using reverberation methods .",
    "we have assembled and analyzed the uv data obtained with agn watch observations of five agns : 3c  390.3 ( @xcite ) , fairall  9 ( @xcite ) , ngc  3783 ( @xcite ) , ngc  5548 during the @xmath11 fos campaign ( @xcite ) , and ngc  7469 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first object in this list is classified as a broad - line radio galaxy , whereas the others are seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "the mean and rms spectra corresponding to each data set have been determined according to the procedure described in rodriguez - pascual , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and are shown for each of the five sources individually in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "these spectra have already appeared in the references cited above , but we reproduce them here as a class to demonstrate the range of line profiles one typically encounters with this process , and also to show the wavelength band used for each of the lines in our analysis ( see below ) . we have selected the ly@xmath12 and  @xmath3 lines for our analysis because they typically have the strongest signal - to - noise ratios . in those cases where the ( redshifted ) ly@xmath1 line has been contaminated by geocoronal emission , we have attempted to set the lower bound of the wavelength bins beyond the contamination region .",
    "however , the ly@xmath1 lines in ngc  5548 and ngc  7469 still show significant contamination ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2spectra ] ) . in all these objects ,",
    "the ly@xmath1 line is further contaminated by  @xmath13 , but no attempt to deblend these two lines has been made here .",
    "the net effect of this is to increase our estimate of the ly@xmath1 velocity dispersion .",
    "these contaminants make the ly@xmath1 measurements much less reliable than the measurements , which are only slightly affected by , e.g. ,  @xmath14 .",
    "these broad line profiles are understood to be produced by the composite emissivity of a broad line region ( blr ) comprised of distinct clouds , which constitute a distribution in velocity around the central mass concentration . along any given line - of - sight ,",
    "say the @xmath15-axis , the velocity dispersion of these emitters is defined as @xmath16 where clearly @xmath17 denotes the @xmath15-component of the total velocity vector @xmath18 .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath19 , we can approximate the doppler - shift formula as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the wavelength in the emitter s frame .",
    "thus , as long as the velocity field is isotropic ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , this relation can be used to replace @xmath17 in equation  ( [ eq : sigma_z ] ) , and thereby to obtain an expression for @xmath6 in terms of observable quantities : @xmath23 the mean values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 appearing on the right hand side of this expression are often calculated from the data assuming that the line profiles are gaussian , for which a determination of the fwhm is then sufficient . to keep this procedure as general as possible ,",
    "we here instead calculate the expectation ( or mean ) value @xmath26 of any given function @xmath27 of @xmath25 using a flux - weighted sum : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ( continuum - subtracted ) line flux at wavelength @xmath25 and the summation is taken over the appropriate wavelength bins @xmath30 .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculated value of @xmath31 is then estimated by assigning the highest and lowest plausible values for the underlying continuum .    in our calculation of @xmath0 ,",
    "we have used the values of @xmath4 published in the references cited above for the 5 sources considered here .",
    "the uncertainty in the value of @xmath4 is estimated using the monte carlo techniques described in white & peterson ( 1994 ) ; however , rather than using a thin shell model for the blr , we have instead assumed an extended blr consistent with the observations and the general inferences drawn from modeling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we chose the line response function to be @xmath32 over the range of radii @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the cloud emission anisotropy and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the inner and outer radial extents , respectively , of the blr .",
    "for example , a @xmath37 that is fairly constant over all blr radii is consistent with the density and velocity fields required to model the @xmath3 line in fairall 9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inner extent of the blr is set to correspond with the @xmath14 cross - correlation lag ( typically having the shortest lag of any of the broad emission lines ) , and the outer extent is optimized such that a histogram of modeled line delays peaks at the observed line lag ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we used the values of @xmath38 for ly@xmath39 and @xmath40 for  @xmath3 calculated by ferland , et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] summarizes the results of these calculations .",
    "our estimates of the errors associated with @xmath4 are much higher than those obtained using a thin - shell blr model .",
    "this is intuitively correct , since we would expect an extended blr to show a much broader , flatter ccf . in most cases , our extended blr model also yields larger error estimates for @xmath4 than the model - independent method described in peterson , et al . (",
    "1998 ) , which estimates errors based on uncertainties due to the observational sampling and the flux measurements only .",
    "this suggests that the latter method underestimates the actual uncertainty if the blr is indeed spatially extended .",
    "the sources of error in @xmath31 include the uncertain fitting of the continuum level , the blending of the broad line wings with the continuum , and line contamination ( as discussed above ) .",
    "since only the former is included in our error estimates , the @xmath31 errors we quote here are probably underestimated .",
    "we also restate that the values of @xmath0 listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] are subject to corrective factors of order unity , stemming from our assumption of an isotropic velocity field .    the last column in table  [ tbl-1 ]",
    "lists the masses estimated by wandel , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the same objects using h@xmath41 reverberation data .",
    "their results assume a gaussian line profile ( usually a good approximation for the h@xmath41 lines ) and use the fwhm to estimate the velocity dispersion .",
    "they use the model - independent method of peterson , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath4 , so their reported mass errors may be underestimated ( as discussed above ) .",
    "perhaps the most striking inference we can draw from an inspection of table  [ tbl-1 ] is that the masses calculated here are considerably lower than those estimated using older reverberation data .",
    "for example , koratkar & gaskell ( 1991b ) predicted masses of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for ngc 3783 , ngc 5548 , and fairall 9 , respectively .",
    "the main discrepancy seems to be that the higher ( and regularly - spaced ) sampling rate adopted by the agn watch has facilitated the detection of shorter time scale variations and cross - correlation lags for these objects .",
    "an additional effect stems from our use of the rms spectrum rather than the mean spectrum to estimate @xmath45 or @xmath31 .",
    "a cursory glance at figures [ fig:3spectra ] and [ fig:2spectra ] suggests that the velocity dispersions of the rms spectral lines are _ smaller _ than those of the mean spectra .",
    "the physical interpretation of this effect is not yet clear , though it may be signaling that the emission from the innermost blr gas does not vary strongly in response to continuum changes .",
    "our mass estimates agree with the wandel , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) results within error bars in all cases except the ly@xmath1 results of 3c  390.3 and ngc  3783 .",
    "the ngc  5548 mass estimate is also consistent with the result obtained by peterson & wandel ( 1999 ) using the same spectral data , though with the assumption that the lines are gaussian .",
    "collier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated the mass of ngc  7469 using the spectral variability in the optical regime combined with a measurement of @xmath45 for the h@xmath39 and h@xmath41 lines to obtain a mass for this object of @xmath46 , which is again consistent with our result .",
    "these cases provide some support for the validity of our method , since they show a consistent mass determination for sources that have `` normal '' ( i.e. , gaussian ) line profiles .",
    "our method is clearly more general , since it appears to be applicable also to sources in which the velocity distribution of the blr does not naturally produce a gaussian line shape .",
    "a caveat one must consider with this procedure is that the error associated with the ly@xmath1 fit can be significant .",
    "the mass estimates made using the ly@xmath1 data are higher than those based on the line in all cases except fairall 9 . as we discussed above , this is probably due to a contamination of the line , which suggests that the results may be more reliable .",
    "it is possible that this problem may be alleviated by line deblending techniques , which we have not incorporated into our analysis here .",
    "our results support the argument made by peterson & wandel ( 1999 ) that a very large mass must be present within a distance of a few light - days from the centers of many agns . for the class of @xmath47 objects in our sample ,",
    "this mass is at least @xmath48 , which is rather compelling evidence for the presence of a point - like object .",
    "this mass density is even higher than that in the galactic center , where we are reasonably sure that the enclosed mass within @xmath49 pc of the nucleus is close to @xmath50 .",
    "alternative models for the latter that invoke a distribution of dark objects , such as neutron stars , white dwarfs , or @xmath51 black holes , can now be ruled out on the basis that in equilibrium , such a distribution would have a core radius significantly larger than the observed limiting size of @xmath49 pc . in the sample of agns considered here",
    ", this exclusion of a distributed dark matter contribution to the enclosed mass appears to be even stronger ( cf .",
    "maoz 1998 ) .",
    "one of the most important results presented here is the relatively accurate determination of the central point mass in these objects . with the exclusion of 3c 390.3 , which appears to belong to a different mass class , the masses of the other four agns ( all seyfert i s ) are very close to each other and are near the low end of the mass scale for agns",
    "this characteristic , and the fact that the smbh at the galactic center has a mass within a factor of @xmath52 or so of this range , hints at a possibly similar formation and evolutionary history for these nuclei . in the galactic center , the power generated by the supermassive black hole seems to be the quasi - steady accretion of plasma ejected by wind - producing stars in the circumnuclear environment , with a rate @xmath53 yr@xmath54 ( coker & melia 1997 ) .",
    "thus , given a central mass @xmath55 , the characteristic time @xmath56 billion years suggests that the black hole sgr a * may have grown to its current size gradually over a hubble time via the steady accretion of gas from its environment .",
    "we speculate that the nuclei in the 4 seyfert i s we have considered here may themselves have formed and evolved in a similar fashion , and that the range in masses may therefore be due principally to a variation of the nuclear gas density from which the black holes accrete .",
