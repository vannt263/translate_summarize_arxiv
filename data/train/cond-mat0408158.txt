    "hysteresis in magnets  @xcite is a paradigm for all history dependent behavior in nature  @xcite .",
    "in addition , hysteresis is the cornerstone of the magnetic data storage industry , and of great technological importance  @xcite .",
    "understanding the full possibilities of magnetic hysteresis is thus important both for fundamental insights and practical implications .",
    "recently , we have shown  @xcite that spin glasses can exhibit stable  multicycle \" hysteresis loops , in that when the external magnetic field is cycled adiabatically , the magnetization returns to itself after @xmath1 cycles of the magnetic field",
    ". this behavior should be experimentally observable in spin glass nanoparticles at low temperature . thus simple one - cycle hysteresis loops , although ubiquitous and generally assumed to be universal , are only part of a much richer phenomenon .    in our previous work  @xcite",
    ", we used the standard edwards - anderson spin glass hamiltonian  @xcite , with ising spins and nearest neighbor interactions in three dimensions .",
    "zero temperature dynamics or monte carlo dynamics at low temperature were used .",
    "starting from saturation , the magnetic field was lowered adiabatically , and then cycled repeatedly over a suitably chosen range .",
    "when the system reached steady state , the order of the multicycle ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) was measured . whether a multicycle is present , and if so , its order , depended on the realization of randomness , varying from one system to another .",
    "there were two weaknesses in the previous work .",
    "first , the systems considered were susceptible to thermal noise meaning that very low temperatures were needed to prevent fluctuations from destroying the periodicity .",
    "second , the model considered was an ising model .",
    "although this has well defined equilibrium statistics , it is not clear that it adequately represents the dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we overcome the problems of the previous paragraph by examining a different system as a candidate for multicycle hysteresis behavior : an array of magnetic nanoparticles . with current technology",
    ", it is standard to fabricate such magnetic arrays according to specification , and a wide variety has been studied experimentally  @xcite and these have important applications for magnetic storage technology , so called  patterned media \"  @xcite . for our purposes , these systems offer many experimental advantages over the spin glass nanoparticles that we considered earlier",
    ". one can build  designer arrays \" with optimized parameters that maximize multicycles and select them in a predictable manner .",
    "spatially resolved measurements are possible , unlike for the spin glass case , making experimental observations of multicycles more practical .",
    "the relatively large size and shape of these also greatly reduces the effects of thermal noise , ( which is one important reason that they are useful in disk drive recording ) .",
    "finally , the ability to address small regions of the array instead of only applying a uniform external magnetic field , and the sensitivity of multicycle phenomena to relatively small changes in system parameters , may open up the possibility of using these systems for computation .    through numerical simulations ,",
    "we demonstrate that multicycles can be seen in an array of pillars made of ferromagnetic material , coupled to each other through dipolar forces , arranged in square and triangular lattices .",
    "the external magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the lattice , _ i.e. _ parallel to the axes of the pillars ; to be specific , we will refer to this as the vertical or @xmath2-direction .",
    "the existence of multicycles is robust , persisting over a large range of system parameters .",
    "we also examine the importance of frustration and disorder in achieving multicycles , a question that has been of great interest in spin glass research  @xcite .",
    "we find that when a square lattice is used instead of a triangular one , multicycles are not as likely to be seen . as discussed later in this paper , the magnetization in the pillars prefers to be approximately vertical , so that the dipolar coupling between the pillars is antiferromagnetic . for a square lattice ,",
    "the dipolar forces between nearest neighbors are not frustrated , unlike the case for a triangular lattice .",
    "( there is still some frustration because of further neighbor interactions . )",
    "this result emphasizes the importance of frustration .    for the spin glass system considered earlier , disorder was explicitly present through the random bond strengths . for the nanoparticle array , although the bond strengths are not random ( unless the spacings between the pillars are varied ) , there is crystal anisotropy , arising from the fact that the magnetization prefers to align itself in a specific direction relative to the crystal axes .",
    "because of the way in which the pillars are grown , the orientation of the crystal axes is different in each pillar , and random .",
    "even if the crystal anisotropy energy is small compared to the dipolar ( and other ) energies , we find that it is sufficient to cause multicycles in an otherwise regular triangular lattice .",
    "the order of the multicycle for a specific sample depends on the orientation of the crystalline axes in its pillars .",
    "although in this paper we only consider the case of randomly oriented crystal axes , if the pillars could be grown with the orientations specified , it would be possible to make arrays whose hysteresis loop are multicycles of desired order .",
    "regardless of the source , it is desirable to have _ some _ inhomogeneity in the model to see multicycles .",
    "otherwise , when the external magnetic field is reduced from saturation , the magnetic moments would be stuck in unstable equilibrium ; in practice , thermal noise would push the system out of this unstable point .",
    "although this effect would not be so extreme subsequently when the external field is cycled over a range that does not reach saturation , it is clear that to reduce the sensitivity to thermal noise , and thereby increase definite multicycle periodicity , explicit quenched disorder is desirable .",
    "the model used for the dynamics in our numerical simulations is discussed in detail in the next section ; the magnetic moment of each pillar is treated as a single ` heisenberg spin ' , _ i.e. _ with its orientation as a continuous variable , with continuous time dynamics .",
    "this is in contrast to the earlier spin glass work , with ising spins and discrete ( event driven ) dynamics .",
    "even though the dynamics are continuous , as discussed in the next section there is a shape anisotropy energy for tall pillars that causes the magnetization to be nearly vertical , and jump from up to down ( or vice versa ) as the external field is changed .",
    "this jump can trigger instabilities in other pillars , forming an avalanche .",
    "we believe that in order for multicycles to be seen , it is essential for the interaction between pillars to be sufficiently strong to cause avalanches ; in the extreme case , when the pillars are independent , it is clear that a one - cycle hysteresis loop would be seen .",
    "however , avalanches are not sufficient to produce disorder : for disordered nearest neighbor ising ferromagnets , the phenomenon of return point memory  @xcite ( rpm ) can be proved , precluding multicycles .",
    "this emphasizes the need for frustration .",
    "this is the first paper , as far as we are aware , that studies adiabatic hysteresis loops in magnetic systems using the more fundamental llg equations rather than simplified relaxational dynamics .",
    "experience from critical phenomena might lead one to believe that the difference between this approach and previous work would be trivial .",
    "however there is an important physical difference that we believe has been overlooked .",
    "llg dynamics destroy symmetry under global spin flip , even though the hamiltonian is symmetric under this operation .",
    "this result , which will be discussed further in the next section of this paper , has significant experimental implications  @xcite .    in the next section of this paper , the dynamical equation used in the numerical simulations",
    "is introduced , and various terms in the model hamiltonian are calculated .",
    "details of the numerics are given in section iii , and the results thereof are presented in section iv .",
    "microscopically , the evolution of classical spins is described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation of motion  @xcite . the llg equation is the simplest equation describing micromagnetic dynamics which contains a reactive term and a dissipative term : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a microscopic spin",
    ", @xmath5 is the local effective field , @xmath6 is a precession coefficient , and @xmath7 is a damping coefficient .",
    "the effective field is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian and @xmath10 represents the effect of thermal noise .",
    "terms in the hamiltonian will be discussed and computed later in this section .",
    "the reactive term of the llg equation describes the precession of the spin about its local field , with the angle between the two remaining constant .",
    "( the coefficient of the reactive term @xmath6 will be set to unity throughout this paper unless otherwise noted . )",
    "the dissipative term aligns the spin with its local effective field .",
    "the cross products in the dissipative term ensure that only the tangential component of the field causes damping , since the length of @xmath4 can not change .",
    "the relaxation time is inversely related to the damping coefficient @xmath7 .",
    "reasonable approximations for @xmath7 are difficult to obtain , but it will be shown that the hysteresis multicycle phenomenon studied in this paper is present for a large range of @xmath7 .    with current technology , nanomagnetic pillars that are approximately 50 nm wide and 100 nm tall can be made of ferromagnetic materials such as nickel  @xcite .",
    "for such small pillars , it is found that the ferromagnetic coupling between the atoms dominates the antiferromagnetic dipolar interactions .",
    "thus the entire pillar consists of a single magnetic domain . using the lattice constant of nickel , each pillar holds approximately @xmath11 atoms , allowing us to treat the pillar as a continuous magnetic medium .",
    "edge effects such as splaying near the boundaries are neglected , and the pillar is treated as a saturated nanomagnet with uniform magnetization .",
    "each single - domain nanomagnet can be viewed as a single degree of freedom : a magnetic moment of fixed magnitude , whose orientation represents the direction of the magnetization  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of this magnetic moment has the _ same _ structure as the micromagnetic llg equation : a reactive part , @xmath12 , and a dissipative part , @xmath13 , although @xmath7 is different from its microscopic value .",
    "( henceforth @xmath4 will denote a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic moment of a pillar , rather than an individual spin . ) as before , the field @xmath5 is given by @xmath14 ; the large number of spins evolving in unison in each pillar allows the thermal noise @xmath10 to be neglected .    to complete the specification of the dynamics of the magnetic moments through eq.([llg ] ) , the hamiltonian has to be calculated in terms of the magnetic moment of each pillar .",
    "the various terms in the hamiltonian are discussed in the following paragraphs .",
    "first , the geometry of the pillars introduces a shape anisotropy term in the hamiltonian : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant to be calculated in the next paragraph and @xmath17 is the z - component of the magnetic moment of the @xmath18 pillar .",
    "shape anisotropy energy is present because of the dipolar interactions between the individual spins within a pillar .",
    "qualitatively , if the magnetization of a tall skinny pillar is vertical , the spins are predominantly lined up ",
    "head to toe \" .",
    "this configuration has a lower energy than when the magnetization is horizontal , in which case the spins are predominantly side by side . for a short wide disk , the effect is clearly reversed .    for the case of tall pillars ,",
    "the shape anisotropy reduces the magnetic moment to an almost ising like variable , that can ( approximately ) only point up or down .",
    "the dynamics of anisotropic and isotropic spins are qualitatively different , with avalanche phenomena more likely to occur in the former than the latter . as mentioned earlier , we believe that avalanches are necessary for hysteretic multicycles . note that even when the shape anisotropy is large , we evolve each magnetic moment according to eq.([llg ] ) rather than as an ising variable , _",
    "i.e. _ with an orientation that evolves continuously with time , though the shape anisotropy causes rapid transitions from up to down states .    deriving the form of @xmath19 and the value of @xmath16 requires solving a magnetostatic problem .",
    "the energy of the field due to the microscopic spins in a single pillar is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnetic field at @xmath22 due to the spins . through",
    "ampere s law and vector calculus manipulations , we can rewrite this in terms of the magnetization , @xmath23 for uniform magnetization , the result can ( up to an additive constant ) be converted to a surface integral , similar to electrostatics , with the self - energy of the magnetic surface  charge \" to be calculated . for cylindrical pillars , which we consider in the rest of this paper , if the magnetization has magnitude @xmath24 and makes an angle @xmath25 to the vertical , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the radius and height of the pillars , the final result is @xmath28 up to an additive constant independent of @xmath25 . comparing with eq.([shape ] ) , we see that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a function of the aspect ratio that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "with @xmath24 equal to the saturation magnetization for nickel , @xmath31  @xcite , the values of @xmath32 for different sized pillars are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "if the pillars are ellipsoidal instead of cylindrical , @xmath32 can be obtained analytically instead of numerically  @xcite .",
    ".[table1]calculated shape anisotropy coefficients @xmath32 for pillars with radius @xmath26=30 nm and different aspect ratios @xmath33 . the ratios between crystal anisotropy coefficients and @xmath32 are also given .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     systems with pillar vacancies are also studied .",
    "vacancies are implemented by introducing a finite probability for a pillar to be missing at every lattice site .",
    "one might expect that these vacancies would introduce more randomness in the system , thereby increasing the number of multicycles . for pillars with r=30 nm and h=150 nm ,",
    "the probability of finding a multicycle is @xmath34 without any vacancies .",
    "when the probability of having a vacancy at a site is small ( @xmath35 ) , the number of multicycles drops by about 40 percent .",
    "when the vacancy probability increases to @xmath36 , the probability of finding multicycles decreases to less than 0.1 .",
    "this decrease in probability could be due to the decrease in number of pillars .",
    "we conclude that , contrary to what one might expect , random vacancies do not increase the probability of multicycles .",
    "if a square lattice is used instead of a triangular one , the dipolar couplings between nearest neighbor pillars are not frustrated . in a checkerboard pattern",
    ", all nearest neighbor bonds would be satisfied , but the next nearest neighbor bonds ( and certain neighbors further apart ) would not be satisfied .",
    "we find that the amount of frustration in the square lattice is sufficient for multicycles to be found , though the probability of finding a multicycle is significantly less on a square lattice than on a triangular lattice .",
    "the number of multicycles found on a square lattice is approximately half of the number found on a triangular lattice .",
    "a possible mechanism for increasing frustration and disorder is to introduce random ferromagnetic couplings between pillars .",
    "these bonds could be manufactured by building one large pillar instead of two small ones .",
    "the large pillar would have two domains that are coupled ferromagnetically . by randomly assigning the bonds with some probability ,",
    "more disorder can be introduced in addition to that from the crystal anisotropy .",
    "we did not study how these ferromagnetic bonds affect the number of multicycles .",
    "one interesting question is whether exact return point memory  @xcite survives when it is extended beyond the random field ising model with purely ferromagnetic interactions to continuous time vector models . to answer that",
    ", we use the llg model with nearest neighbor random ferromagnetic interactions and the same crystalline and shape anisotropy model that is used above ( without dipole coupling ) .",
    "we apply a random field and search for violations of rpm with different random seeds .",
    "we start at high fields and go to a minimum field of @xmath37 and record the spin configuration .",
    "then we go up to a field @xmath38 and back down to @xmath37 .",
    "we find that for a @xmath39 square lattice of spins , that of order 1 percent of systems _ violate _ rpm because the initial and final minimum configurations and total magnetization are substantially different .",
    "violation of rpm is seen both with and without the precessional term in eq.([llg ] ) .",
    "this shows that it is not possible to extend the proof of rpm to continuous vector models .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the feasibility of observing multicycles and non - complementary hysteresis loops in a candidate experimental system : that of cylindrical magnetic nano - pillars arranged on a lattice",
    ". we have performed realistic numerical simulations of this system , by calculating the magnetic interactions between the pillars and then employing continuous spin dynamics and the landau lifshitz gilbert equation to obtain their time evolution .",
    "using physically appropriate parameters , we have shown that there is often multicycle hysteretic behavior , i.e. a periodic adiabatic external magnetic field causes a subharmonic steady state response in the magnetization .",
    "we have also shown that , even though the hamiltonian is invariant under spin and field reversal , the dynamics are not , so that the two branches of the major hysteresis loop are not complementary .",
    "this result can not be obtained with an ising approximation to the system and its dynamics .",
    "further implications of the non - complementary nature of llg dynamics will be studied in future research .",
    "because systems of this kind are currently the subject of much experimental investigation , we believe that it would be fruitful to attempt to observe the unusual behavior predicted here .",
