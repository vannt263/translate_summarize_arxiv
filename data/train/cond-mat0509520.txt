    "the discovery of high-@xmath10 superconductivity , and the observation@xcite that strong correlations are important in connection with these compounds has led to a tremendous interest in understanding strongly correlated electron physics .",
    "in particular the two simplest models for strongly correlated electrons , namely the hubbard and @xmath0 models , have been the subject of intensive studies .",
    "for example , one question of crucial interest is the interplay between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism close to the insulating phase in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the ground state of this model on the square lattice is known to be antiferromagnetic at half - filling and one of the important questions is what happens upon doping .",
    "all the approaches to these strong coupling problems involve approximations , and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the artefact due to approximations from the true features of the model .",
    "however , for the case of the square lattice , both the variational monte - carlo method ( vmc)@xcite and mean - field theories@xcite have found a d - wave superconducting phase in the the @xmath0 model .",
    "a wavefunction combining antiferromagnetism and superconductivity was proposed for the hubbard and @xmath0 models@xcite , allowing to reconcile the variational results between these two models .",
    "this wavefunction allowed for an excellent variational energy and order parameter and a range of coexistence between superconductivity and anti - ferromagnetism was found .",
    "further investigations of this class of wavefunctions has been very fruitful for the square lattice .",
    "this allowed to successfully compare to some of the experimental features with the high-@xmath10 cuprates@xcite , even if of course many questions remain regarding the nature of the true ground state of the system .",
    "the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) scenario proposed by anderson @xcite was argued to be even more relevant in the geometry of the triangular lattice . at half - filling ,",
    "the lattice is a frustrated magnet : the competition between the exchange integrals leads to unsatisfied bonds .",
    "the original expectation is that quantum fluctuations might lead to a spin - liquid behavior .",
    "however , at half - filling , it appears by now that the spin-@xmath1 triangular lattice has a three sublattice coplanar magnetic order @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations are nevertheless strong , and the sublattice magnetization is strongly reduced due to these fluctuations .",
    "it is therefore expected that the magnetism is fragile and quickly destroyed by doping and that a strong rvb instability is present . indeed",
    ", rvb mean field theories @xcite were used for the @xmath0 model , and @xmath4 pairing was found over a significant range of doping .",
    "the same approach and questions that arise in the framework of the @xmath0 model on the square lattice are thus very relevant in the present frustrated lattice .",
    "the success of the variational approach for the square lattice suggests to investigate the same class of variational wavefunctions for the triangular one .    besides its own theoretical interest",
    ", another motivation for understanding the physics of electrons on a triangular lattice is provided by the recent discovery of superconductivity at low temperature in the coo@xmath11 layered compounds @xcite ( na@xmath12coo@xmath11.yh@xmath11o ) . in these systems",
    ", superconductivity is observed in a range of electron doping @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "na@xmath12coo@xmath11.yh@xmath11o consists of two dimensional coo@xmath11 layers separated by thick insulating layers of na@xmath16 ions and h@xmath11o molecules .",
    "it is a triangular net of edge sharing oxygen octahedra ;  co ions are at the center of the octahedra forming a 2d triangular lattice .",
    "takada et al .",
    "@xcite speculated that this system might be viewed as a doped spin-@xmath1 mott insulator .",
    "based on lda calculations @xcite , a simplified single band @xmath0 picture with negative @xmath17 and electron doping was put forward @xcite . such systems",
    "might thus be the long - sought low - temperature resonating valence bond superconductor , on a lattice which was at the basis of anderson s original ideas on a possible quantum spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "we propose in this paper to study the @xmath0 model within the framework of the variational monte - carlo ( vmc ) method , which provides a variational upper bounds for the ground state energy .",
    "in contrast to mean - field theory , it has the advantage of exactly treating the no double - occupancy constraint .",
    "vmc using simple rvb wave - functions has been used for the triangular lattice @xcite and it was found that @xmath18 superconductivity is stable over a large range of doping .",
    "however , in the previous study the fact that the @xmath0 is magnetically ordered at half - filling was not taken into account .",
    "we expect that the frustration in the triangular lattice may lead to a richer phase diagram and to many different instabilities .",
    "we thus propose here to study extended wave - functions containing at the same time magnetism , flux phase and rvb instabilities , in a similar spirit as for the square lattice@xcite , in order to study in detail the interplay between frustrated magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "given the non - collinear nature of the magnetic order parameter compared to the case of the square lattice , the task is however much more complicated .",
    "we thus present in this work a general mean - field hamiltonian which takes into account the interplay between magnetic , rvb and flux - phase instabilities .",
    "the resulting variational wave - function is sampled with an extended vmc , which uses _ pfaffian _ updates rather than the usual determinant updates .",
    "we show that the interplay between the different instabilities leads to a faithful representation of the ground - state at half - filling , and we also find good variational energies upon doping .",
    "to benchmark our wave - function , we carry out exact diagonalizations on a small @xmath19 sites cluster and compare the variational energies and the exact ones .",
    "finally , a commensurate spin density wave is considered , and is shown to be relevant for the case of hole doping .",

    "we study the @xmath0 model on the triangular lattice defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath20 the model describes electrons hopping with an amplitude @xmath17 , and interacting with an antiferromagnetic exchange term @xmath21 between nearest neighbor sites ( denoted @xmath22 ) of a triangular lattice .",

    "@xmath27 is restricted to the subspace where there are no doubly occupied sites . in order to simplify the connection to the cobaltates we set @xmath28 in the following and",

    "@xmath31 corresponds to a @xmath0 model at @xmath32 for @xmath33 , by virtue of a particle - hole transformation . in the first part of this section",
    ", we emphasize on the method to construct a variational wave - function containing both superconductivity and non - collinear magnetism .",
    "the wave - function allows to consider @xmath34-sublattice magnetism , however , since the latter wavefunction is restricted to a @xmath34 site supercell , we briefly comment on a second simpler variational wave - function type , which allows to describe commensurate spin order . in the second part of the section , we define the relevant instabilities and the corresponding order parameters .      in order to study this model",
    "we use a variational wavefunction built out of the ground state of the following mean - field like hamiltonian : @xmath35 @xmath36 contains at the same time bcs pairing ( @xmath37 ) , an arbitrary external magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) , and arbitrary hopping phases ( @xmath39 ) , possibly spin dependent .",
    "these variational parameters are unrestricted on the @xmath40 sites and the corresponding bonds of a @xmath34-site supercell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "-site supercell of the triangular lattice .",
    "the onsite magnetic variational parameters can vary independently on each of the site a , b and c of the supercell .",
    "the bcs pairing as well as the flux vary independently on each of the different dashed bonds . ]",
    "we allow both singlet ( @xmath41 ) and general triplet ( @xmath42 ) pairing symmetries to be present .",
    "they correspond to choosing : @xmath43    since @xmath36 is quadratic in fermion operators it can be solved by a bogoliubov transformation . in the most general case considered here ,",
    "this gives rise to a @xmath44 eigenvalue problem , which we solve numerically .",
    "we then find the ground state of @xmath36 @xmath45 here @xmath46 are numerical coefficients .",
    "note that @xmath47 has neither a fixed number of particles due to the presence of pairing , nor a fixed total @xmath48 due to the non - collinear magnetic order .",
    "thus in order to use it for the vmc study we apply to it the following projectors : @xmath49 which projects the wave - function on a state with fixed number of electrons and @xmath50 which projects the wave - function on the sector with total @xmath51 .",
    "finally we discard all configurations with doubly occupied sites by applying the complete gutzwiller projector @xmath52 .",
    "the wavefunction we use as an input to our variational study is thus : @xmath53 although the wavefunction ( [ eq : startfunc ] ) looks formidable , it can be reduced to a form suitable for vmc calculations . using @xmath54",
    "we find that @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the _ pfaffian _ of the matrix @xmath57 .",
    "using this last relation , the function ( [ eq : startfunc ] ) can now be evaluated numerically using a monte carlo procedure with pfaffian updates , as introduced in ref .  .",
    "in the particular case where @xmath58 and at @xmath51 ( this happens if the bcs pairing is of singlet type _ and _ the magnetic order is collinear ) , the pfaffian reduces to a simple determinant , and the methods becomes equivalent to the standard variational monte - carlo@xcite technique .    the above mean field hamiltonian and wavefunction contain the main physical ingredients and broken symmetries we want to implement in the wavefunction . in order to further improve the energy and allow for out of plane fluctuations of the magnetic order",
    "we also add a nearest - neighbor spin - dependent jastrow @xcite term to the wave - function : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an additional variational parameter .",
    "our final wavefunction is thus : @xmath61 when @xmath62 the jastrow factor favors all configurations which belong to the ground state manifold of a classical ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice .",
    "such a manifold is exponentially large @xcite , and this jastrow factor thus provides a complementary source of spin fluctuations .    in what follows we use the wavefunction ( [ eq : wavefinal ] ) directly for the vmc , but we also examine improved wavefunctions with respect to ( [ eq : wavefinal ] ) that can be obtained by applying one or more lanczos steps @xcite : @xmath63 with optimized@xcite @xmath64 . since the calculation of lanczos step wave functions beyond the first step is very time consuming , most of the results we will present here were obtained using a single lanczos step .    in the following , to clearly indicate which wavefunction we use , we will denote them in the following way : @xmath65 , where mf denotes the fields present in the mean - field like hamiltonian @xmath36 , @xmath21 is present if we use the jastrow factor , @xmath66 denotes the presence and the number of lanczos steps applied on top of the bare wave function .    as usual with the vmc procedure ,",
    "these general wave functions are now used to minimize the expectation value of the total energy @xmath67 by changing the variational parameters .",
    "we used a correlated measurement technique @xcite combined with parallel processing to smoothen the energy landscape and use a steepest - descent type routine to locate the minimum of energy .",
    "we then define the _ condensation energy _",
    "@xmath68 of the optimal wave function as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the energy of the gutzwiller wave function , i.e. the fully projected fermi sea at zero magnetization . in some cases we had to keep a small bcs pairing field to avoid numerical instabilities",
    "let us note that the linear size of the @xmath57 matrix is two times larger than in the simpler case of determinantal update vmc .",
    "therefore our largest @xmath71 sites cluster with pfaffian updates corresponds roughly to a @xmath72 sites cluster using standard updates .",
    "since the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ eq : hmf ] ) is restricted to a @xmath34 site supercell , we investigated also a second class of mean - field hamiltonians based on collinear commensurate structures , which are not contained in the previous hamiltonian . for this type of phase",
    ", we used a simpler mean - field ansatz along the lines of ref .  .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian written in k - space is @xmath73 where k does run over the brillouin zone of the original triangular lattice , @xmath74 is the dispersion of the free electron hamiltonian , and @xmath75 is the fourier transform of @xmath76 .",
    "depending on @xmath77 , the ground state of the hamiltonian is a commensurate charge density wave ( @xmath78 ) or a spin density wave ( @xmath79 ) .    at",
    "half - filling , we considered also several commensurate flux phases with @xmath80 flux per plaquette , using the landau gauge is gauge invariant , however the gauge plays a non trivial role in the projected wave - function .",
    "indeed , the kinetic energy of the projected wave - function depends on the chosen gauge .",
    "one can not exclude that another choice of the gauge could lead to a better wave - function . ] with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the one with the lowest energy was found to be the @xmath83 , as predicted theoretically @xcite , giving an energy close to the simple @xmath18 wave - function .",
    "upon doping however the energy of such commensurate flux phases are rapidly much worse than the energies of our best wave functions .",
    "the main reason for this poor performance upon doping is the rather bad kinetic energy of these wave functions .      by minimizing all the variational parameters of the mean - field hamiltonians ( [ eq : hmf ] ) and ( [ eq : hsdw ] ) on a @xmath19 and a @xmath84 site lattice , we find that the relevant instabilities present at the mean field level consist of :     for the coplanar @xmath85 antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the spins lie in the @xmath86 plane .",
    "the @xmath87-component of the vector chirality ( @xmath88 ) on each triangular plaquette forms a staggered pattern .",

    "to simplify the calculations , this expectation value has been sampled using wavefunctions without the projector @xmath50 .",
    "we have checked that this gives the same result as the correlation function @xmath102 calculated with the projector @xmath50 . * the @xmath87 component of the vector chirality ( spin twist ) on nearest neighbor bonds : @xmath103 we have checked that the measured vector chirality has the symmetry of the staggered currents derived from the 120@xmath104 coplanar structure ( c.f .",

    "we have also checked that the value of @xmath108 is independent of the choice of @xmath60 and @xmath109 .",
    "we consider in this section the heisenberg model ( which is the limit of the @xmath0 model at half - filling , up to a constant ) the comparison with the large body of existing results for the heisenberg model allows us to benchmark the quality of our wave - function .",
    "let us first briefly discuss the symmetry of the variational parameters at half - filling .",
    "the variational magnetic field minimizes the energy for the two degenerate @xmath85 configurations .",
    "we found that the bcs pairing symmetry in the presence of @xmath89 order is of @xmath94 type , whereas the @xmath110 , the @xmath111 and the @xmath112 pairings have close but higher energies .",
    "finally , a staggered spin flux variational order improves a little bit the energy .",
    "interestingly , this latter variational order is present in the ground state of the classical heisenberg model .",
    "however , this instability was only relevant at half - filling , and the energy gain when @xmath113 is not significant .",

    "the stars are the best estimates of the ground state energy available in the literature @xcite .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ]    the @xmath120 wave - function is thus the best approximation , within our variational space , of the ground state of the heisenberg model .",
    "we compare its energy with other estimates of the ground state energy in the literature ( see fig .  [",

    "more precisely , we find in the thermodynamic limit an energy per site of @xmath125 for our variational wave - function . applying one lanczos step leads to a small further improvement of the energy to @xmath126 . a summary of the energies and of the @xmath85 magnetization for the heisenberg model are given in table  [ tabel ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "inspection of these results shows that our wave - function has in the thermodynamic limit an energy only @xmath127 higher than the estimates of more sophisticated , but restricted to the undoped case , methods@xcite .",
    "indeed , these latter methods use pure spin variational wave - function as a starting point , restoring quantum fluctuations with a non - variational method .",
    "let us point out however that these methods are not giving an upper bound on the true ground state energy , so the ground state energy could in principle lie between this result and our variational one . since our variational wavefunction already gives an excellent energy it would be interesting to check how the ( non variational ) methods used to improve the energy starting with a much cruder variational starting point would work with our variational wavefunction and which energy it would give .",
    "we leave this point for future investigation however .",
    "our wavefunction shows a reduced but finite magnetic order that survives in the triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet ( tha ) .",
    "the @xmath85 magnetization of our wavefunction is reduced by the bcs pairing down to @xmath128 of the classical value ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : m ] ) which is somewhat larger than the spin - wave result .",
    "thus in addition to having an excellent energy , our wavefunction seems to capture the physics of the ground state of the heisenberg system correctly .",
    "let us note that the bcs order of the wave - function is destroyed by the full gutzwiller projector at half - filling .",
    "so , despite the presence of a variational superconducting order parameter , the system is of course not superconducting at half filling .",
    "somehow the bcs variational parameter helps to form singlets , which reduces the amplitude of the af order .",
    "this is very similar to what happens for the @xmath0 model on the square lattice : the inclusion of a superconducting gap decreases the energy and decreases also the magnetization from @xmath129 down to @xmath130 , which is somewhat larger than the best qmc estimates ( @xmath131 , see refs .",
    "thus the wave - function mixing magnetism and a rvb gap seem to be interesting variationally , both in the square and triangular lattice , to restore spin fluctuations that were frozen in the pure classical magnetic wave - function .",
    "for the triangular lattice , the present work is the first attempt to reproduce the magnetic order in the tha in terms of a fermionic representation , which gives results in good agreement with other methods .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is of course that the fermionic language allows to directly consider the case of hole and electron doping in the af background , which is the case we consider in the following sections .",
    "very few results exist away from half - filling , so in order to have a point of comparison for our variational approach we will compare it with exact diagonalizations on very small clusters .",
    "having ascertained that our wavefunction is indeed in good agreement with the exact results on a small cluster , we can then use it with confidence to describe much larger systems and extract the physics of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , we start by comparing on a @xmath19 site cluster different wave - functions with the exact - diagonalization results for the case of electron doping ( see fig .  [ fig:12sites ] ) , since larger lattices are not readily available .",
    "interestingly , it was found that even with only @xmath133 lanczos steps on our best wave - function ( @xmath117 ) the energy has almost converged to the exact ground state energy at half - filling .",
    "note that small system size is the worst possible case for a vmc method since the simple variational wavefunction is not expected to reproduce well the short distance correlations , as we fix the long - range magnetic correlations in our variational ansatz by imposing an on - site magnetic field , but we do not introduce short range corrections .",
    "variational monte - carlo instead focus on the long distance properties , which will become dominant in the energy as the lattice size increases .",
    "nevertheless , the short range correlations contributes significantly to the energy on small lattices .",
    "one can thus expect on general grounds the energies to become increasingly good as the system size increases , provided that the correct long range order has been implemented in the wavefunction .",
    "the lanczos iterations allow to correct this local structure of the wave - function . here",
    "we see that by changing this local structure our wave - function is converging very fast to the ground state .",
    "this is a good indication that even away from half filling our wavefunction is quite efficient in capturing the physics of the system .",
    "actually , the variance of the energy per site @xmath134 reaches its maximum value for doping @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) , but applying one lanczos step reduces drastically the variance : @xmath137 . at half - filling ,",
    "a variance - energy plot for the three functions @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) allows to extrapolate the energy at @xmath140 variance , and we get an energy per site of @xmath141 , which is very close to the exact result @xmath142 .     site cluster for the different variational wave - functions .",
    "we have done exact diagonalization ( ed ) for a 12 sites cluster with same periodic boundary conditions .",
    "[ fig:12sites ] ]    let us now use our wavefunction to describe large systems away from half filling .",
    "we now focus on a @xmath71 site cluster , which is the largest cluster we can treat with a reasonable effort .",
    "we have first measured the condensation energy per site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ec ] ) for different types of instabilities .     versus electron doping for the @xmath71 sites lattice .",
    "we show different wave - functions and also the best estimate in the literature@xcite at half - filling ( open diamond ) .",
    "[ fig : ec ] ]    very interestingly , the @xmath143 is even better than a simple @xmath18 rvb state .",
    "moreover , the rvb order is only weakly increasing the condensation energy in presence of the antiferromagnetic background ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "this is suggesting that superconductivity is only weakly present in the @xmath0 model when @xmath145 which is also confirmed by the measurement of the superconducting gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] ) .",
    "for a @xmath71 site triangular cluster in our best wave - function ( full triangles ) , in the @xmath94 wave - function ( open squares ) .",
    "for comparison we show the amplitude of the d - wave gap in a @xmath146 _ square _ lattice ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "the superconducting order of our best wave - function is approximately @xmath147 times smaller in amplitude and in range of stability than the d - wave pairing in a @xmath148 _ square _ lattice with the same boundary conditions . for electron doping @xmath149",
    "we find that the @xmath94 bcs pairing symmetry has the same energies as the @xmath110 one , and also as the wavefunctions with @xmath111 and @xmath112 pairings .",
    "very strikingly , the @xmath85 magnetic order parameter is surviving up to high doping @xmath150 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] . long - range magnetic order at finite doping is potentially caused by a limitation of the vmc method , in that it is not possible in our calculation to model wavefunction with a finite correlation length , i.e. short range @xmath85 magnetic order . in our calculation , we can either totally suppress the long - range @xmath85 and get back to the gutzwiller wave - function , or use the long - range @xmath85 magnetic order that is highly stabilized by the potential energy .",
    "no intermediate scenario , such as incommensurate structures , is yet available in our calculations , but one can only expect the optimization of the magnetic structure to increase the region of stability for magnetism . we interpret this finding as an indication that the hole motion is not drastically modified by the presence of the non - collinear magnetic structure , so that short range magnetic correlations will survive up to high electron doping .     magnetic order @xmath122 measured in the @xmath144 for a @xmath71 site cluster .",
    "inset : the amplitude of the staggered spin - current @xmath151 in the same wave - function .",
    "[ fig : m ] ]    for the @xmath152 model on the square lattice , it is commonly understood that the ising nel order is not surviving high doping because of its costs in kinetic energy : whenever a hole wants to move in a antiferromagnetic spin background , it generates a ferromagnetic cloud .",
    "therefore , good kinetic energies and nel ising order are not compatible . in our case , the @xmath34-sublattice order imposes no such constraint on the kinetic energy of the holes , because of the @xmath85 structure .",
    "we see this fact in our wave - function energies : the potential energy is improved when starting from the gutzwiller wavefunction and adding @xmath85 correlations , but the kinetic energy is unchanged .",
    "our best wavefunction has a better potential energy than the gutzwiller wavefunction ( and also than the different cfp wavefunction ) , but it also keeps the same kinetic energy . therefore , this qualitatively explains why one can stabilize the @xmath34-sublattice magnetic phase for a large set of @xmath21 values .",
    "finally , we note that the staggered spin - current pattern is also present for doping @xmath153 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the jastrow variational parameter @xmath60 ( [ eq : jastrow ] ) is changing sign at @xmath150 when @xmath154 : for @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) the jastrow factor favors classical ising ( ferro- ) anti - ferromagnetic states .",
    "the vmc results show that the competition between the classical ising configuration on the triangular lattice and the @xmath85 order is improving the energy .",
    "we argue that the classical jastrow simulates with a good approximation quantum fluctuations around the @xmath85 order .",
    "note that the jastrow does not play the same role as the bcs pairing : the bcs pairing forms configurations of resonating singlets , and the jastrow factor forms classical ising configurations .",
    "it is also worth noting that at higher doping the jastrow parameter is leading to a small condensation energy of @xmath157 for a large range of doping ( @xmath158 $ ] ) .",
    "it was checked that this gain in energy does not decrease with the size of the lattice and is also present for a square lattice geometry .",
    "we found also that for the small clusters ( @xmath19 and @xmath84 sites ) the system was gaining a significant amount of energy when having a weak ferromagnetic polarization .",
    "therefore , this is suggesting that the gutzwiller wavefunction is not the best approximation of the ground state of the @xmath0 model in the high doping limit .",
    "nevertheless , the jastrow factor does not introduce long - range correlation and the variational wavefunction we introduce here is still a fermi - liquid .",
    "note that the variance of the energy per site @xmath134 reaches its maximum value for doping @xmath150 for the @xmath144 with @xmath159 , and applying one lanczos step leads to @xmath137 .      for hole doping",
    "the scenario is strikingly different .",
    "the @xmath85 order is weakened in a strong @xmath94 rvb background and disappears at doping @xmath161 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ecm ] and     for different wavefunctions in a @xmath71 site cluster.[fig : ecm ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] ) .     magnetic order measured in our best wavefunction for the @xmath71 site cluster ( left scale , full triangles ) and the ratio of the polarization @xmath162 on the saturated polarization @xmath163 in our best wavefunction ( right scale , full circles ) .",
    "we show also the absolute magnetization @xmath164 for the spin density wave wavefunction ( left scale , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : spinz ] ) .",
    "[ fig : mm ] ]     site lattice for the spin density wave wavefunction .",
    "open ( filled ) circles denotes down ( up ) spins .",
    "the size of each circle is proportional to the respective amplitude of the on - site magnetization .",
    "we find that the spins forms a stripe - like pattern , alternating ferromagnetic bonds in the @xmath165 direction , and antiferromagnetic bond in the two other directions .",
    "the average on the lattice sites of the absolute value of the local magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] . ]",
    "when superconductivity disappears , there is a first order transition to a commensurate spin density wave .",
    "no coexistence between superconductivity and the spin density wave was found .",
    "then , a ferromagnetic phases emerges with a strong gain of condensation energy .",
    "indeed the polarized states are leading to a strong gain in kinetic energy .",
    "this can be understood in the simple picture of the stoner model , which gives a critical onsite repulsion related to the density of states : @xmath166 .",
    "ferromagnetism becomes favorable if @xmath167 is sitting at a sharp peak of @xmath168 . in the triangular lattice",
    "the tight binding ( tb ) density of states is strongly asymmetric and has a sharp peak at the @xmath169 electronic density lying at the van hove singularity .",
    "note also that the simple @xmath0 model of a @xmath34 site cluster with @xmath133 electrons shows that in the @xmath170 the ground state is a singlet , whereas the ground state is a triplet in the @xmath2 case .",
    "this shows that the negative sign of @xmath17 with hole doping is inducing ferromagnetic correlations on a very small cluster .",
    "we find again trace of these correlations and ferromagnetic tendencies in the range of electronic density @xmath171 $ ] in our @xmath71 site lattice .",
    "such a ferromagnetic instability was also predicted in ref .   by comparing the energy of the rvb wavefunction with an analytical calculation of the energy of the fully polarized state .",
    "we see that minimizing the energy by changing the variational onsite magnetic field leads to similar results .",
    "moreover , at @xmath172 doping , there is a nesting of the fermi surface , with three possible @xmath57 vectors .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that a particle - hole instability of corresponding pitch vector @xmath57 is stabilized close to this doping .",
    "we have investigated the following instabilities : a commensurate charge density wave , and a spin density wave .",
    "interestingly , the commensurate spin density wave was stabilized .",
    "indeed , we have found that the scattering between the @xmath173 and @xmath174 vectors introduced in the hamiltonian @xmath175 ( particle - hole channel ) allow to gain kinetic energy in the range of doping @xmath176 $ ] .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we have only considered the mean - field hamiltonian containing one of the three possible nesting vectors : @xmath100 . finally , the phase is stabilized , when compared to the rvb and ferromagnetic phases , in the window @xmath177 $ ] .",
    "nonetheless , no coexistence between superconductivity and the spin density wave was found : the energy is minimized either for @xmath178 , or @xmath179 depending on the doping , with @xmath75 of @xmath18 symmetry type in the latter case .",
    "measuring the on - site magnetization value , we found that the spin density wave is forming a collinear stripe - like pattern in the spins degrees of freedom , whereas the charge is found to be uniformly distributed among the lattice sites , as expected ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spinz ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the on - site magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm ] as a function of doping .      based on our wavefunction",
    "we can now give the phase diagram for the doped system on the triangular lattice . the phase diagram , summarizing",
    "the various instabilities discussed in the previous sections is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .",
    "model we get with @xmath2 . here",
    "we sketch on an arbitrary scale the order parameter amplitude of the @xmath85 magnetic phase , the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath98 ) , the superconducting @xmath18 phase ( @xmath180 ) , the commensurate spin density wave ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "note that for electron density @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the energy is degenerated , within the error bars due to the monte - carlo sampling , with the pairings @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath95 .",
    "the pitch vector of the commensurate spin density wave is @xmath100 , and this phase is depicted more in details in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinz ] . ]",
    "this phase diagram prompts for several comments .",
    "first one notices immediately that the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in this model depends crucially on the sign of the hopping integral ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ) .    for both hole and electron doping , the triangular lattice has a very different phase diagram from the square lattice one .",
    "plays no role because of the particle - hole symmetry of a bipartite lattice . ] in the square lattice , the af order disappears at @xmath183 and the d - wave rvb dies at @xmath150 for the same value of @xmath21 . in the triangular lattice , a similar stability of superconductivity exists on the hole side , but the electronically doped side is resolutely dominated by antiferromagnetic instabilities .",
    "our results , based on an improved class of wavefunctions , present marked differences with previous approximate results for the doped system . on the electron side , mean - field theories would have suggested that the long - range magnetic order state undergoes a first order phase transition@xcite into a uniform @xmath94 superconducting state at @xmath184 for values of @xmath21 similar to those considered here .",
    "a rationalization of these results would be that the frustration of the lattice , which was from the start the motivation of rvb as a competing state , disfavors magnetic order .",
    "our results , where the gutzwiller projection is treated exactly within the residual error bars due to the statistics , are in strong disagreement with this mean - field theory .",
    "contrarily to the mean - field result , magnetism is dominant and the superconducting order is not favored on the electronic side . in addition , the @xmath0 model on the triangular lattice was expected to have a strong and large rvb instability , since the coordination number is higher than on most of the other lattices , and naively we would expect this to provide an easy way to form singlets . in this work",
    "we show that it is not the case : for electron doping the system is magnetic , and for hole doping the system is superconducting , but the range of superconductivity is not extraordinary large ( @xmath185 ) , and smaller than on the square lattice .",
    "previous variational approaches@xcite were restricted to pure superconducting wavefunctions @xmath18 on a @xmath186 square lattice with @xmath187 . in that work",
    "it was found that superconductivity is stabilized up to electron doping @xmath188 and hole doping @xmath189 for similar albeit slightly different values of @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) . in our work , for the case of electron doping , which corresponds to the doping in the cobaltite experiments , our phase diagram , using the larger class of wavefunctions ,",
    "is clearly completely different from this previous result , and the stabilization of the superconductivity in that case was clearly an artefact of the too restricted variational subspace . as show in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] superconductivity is strongly weakened by the presence of 3-sublattice magnetization and is present only in the range of electron doping @xmath192 $ ] . on the contrary , for the case of hole doping , superconductivity had higher energy than ferromagnetic and spin density wave phases for @xmath193 .",
    "we thus confirm that the previous results are not an artefact of their restricted variational subspace , and find an acceptable agreement for the phase diagram .",
    "however we emphasize the presence of the spin density wave wavefunction that was not considered in the mentioned work and implies a small reduction of the superconductivity range .",
    "our calculation thus clearly prompts for a reexaminations of the arguments on the nature of superconductivity in a frustrated lattice .",
    "clearly the non - collinear nature of the order parameter helps making the af order much more stable to electron doping than initially anticipated .",
    "understanding such issues is of course a very crucial and challenging question .",
    "moreover , on the triangular lattice , no significant enhanced cooperative effect between magnetism and superconductivity seems to be observed : the electron doped side has a magnetic signature , and the hole doped side a superconducting one , but the two orders seem to exclude each other as much as they can , contrarily to what happens for the square lattice . even in the parts of the phase diagram where coexistence is observed , coexistence between magnetism and superconductivity in the electron doped case shows again that superconductivity is decreased in the presence of strong long range magnetic correlations .",
    "in this paper we have presented a variational monte - carlo study of the @xmath0 ( @xmath194 and @xmath2 ) model on the triangular lattice , using extended wavefunction containing both superconductivity and non - collinear magnetism , as well as flux phase instabilities .",
    "the method we used to construct and sample the wavefunction is quite general and applicable to other lattices ( honeycomb , kagome , ladders ... ) as well as other symmetries ( e.g. triplet superconductivity ) .",
    "it thus provides a general framework to tackle the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in frustrated systems .",
    "we obtained very good variational energies at half - filling when comparing with other more sophisticated methods , specialized to the half - filled case .",
    "the fermionic representation of our wavefunction allows to consider hole and electron doping .",
    "the most stable pairing corresponds to singlet pairing .",
    "we find that @xmath18 superconductivity is only weakly stabilized for electron doping in a very small window ( @xmath192 $ ] ) and is much stronger and also appears in a wider range ( @xmath195 $ ] ) in the case of hole doping .",
    "a commensurate spin density wave phase is leading to a gain in kinetic energy and is stabilized in the small window @xmath177 $ ] hole doping .",
    "finally , ferromagnetism emerges in a wide range for hole doping @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "very surprisingly , the 3-sublattice magnetism which is present at half - filling extends to a very wide range of electron doping @xmath197 $ ] and is suppressed very fast in the case of hole doping @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "the large extent of @xmath85 order for electron doping is responsible for the suppression of superconductivity .",
    "this feature was neither observed in previous vmc calculations , nor predicted by the mean field theories , and prompts for a reexamination of the question of the stability of magnetic order on a triangular system .",
    "our results show that , for electron doping , the square and triangular lattices behave in a very different way . for the square lattice",
    ", the @xmath0 hamiltonian finds a domain of stability of superconductivity and a pairing symmetry that is very consistent with other methods .",
    "it is thus a natural candidate to investigate superconducting phases in systems like the cuprates . for the case of the triangular lattice ,",
    "the predicted phase diagram is dominated by antiferromagnetic instabilities , and superconductivity , albeit slightly present , is strongly suppressed .",
    "this clearly indicates that , contrarily to what was suggested by mean - field and previous variational calculations , the @xmath0 model itself is not a good starting point to tackle the superconductivity of the cobaltite compounds , where superconductivity is observed in the range of electron density @xmath199 $ ] .",
    "this model must be completed by additional ingredients to obtain a faithful description of the experimental system .",
    "two missing ingredients in the simple @xmath0 model could solve this discrepancy and perhaps allow to obtain a superconducting instability .",
    "on one hand , a strong coulomb repulsion is expected in this type of compound .",
    "such a long - range interaction is not taken into account in the @xmath0 model .",
    "thus a coulomb @xmath200 term should be added to get a @xmath201 model . on the other hand , in this paper",
    ", we have used a single - band model as a first step to study the co - based oxides .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the multi - band effect plays an essential role for superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the interaction between the three bands of the compound could play a non trivial role in the physics of the @xmath0 model .",
    "therefore , a study of the 3-band model could also be of interest .",
    "such an analysis can be done by extending the methods exposed in this paper to these more complicated models ."
