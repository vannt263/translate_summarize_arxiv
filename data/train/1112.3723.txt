    "a uniformly frustrated xy model can be defined by the hamiltonian    [ ffxy ] @xmath0 where the interaction of the variables @xmath1 defined on the sites @xmath2 of some regular two - dimensional lattice is described by periodic function @xmath3 @xmath4 is the coupling constant , and the summation is performed over all pairs of nearest neighbors @xmath5 on the lattice .",
    "the non - fluctuating ( quenched ) variables @xmath6 defined on lattice bonds have to satisfy the constraint @xmath7    on all lattice plaquettes .",
    "the notation @xmath8 below the sign of summation implies the directed sum of variables @xmath6 over the perimeter of plaquette @xmath9 in the counterclockwise direction . for @xmath10 the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ ffxy ] ) is isomorphic to the conventional xy model ( without frustration ) , whereas for @xmath11 ( the maximal irreducible value of @xmath12 , see ref . )",
    "this model is called fully frustrated .    since eighties , the uniformly frustrated and ,",
    "especially , the fully frustrated xy models on various lattices have been studied rather intensively ( for reviews , see refs . and ) , mostly in relation with experiments on josephson junction arrays .",
    "@xcite in these artificial superconducting systems variables @xmath1 can be associated with the phases of the superconducting order parameter on different superconducting grains forming an array , and @xmath13 is related to the vector potential of a uniform magnetic field , whose magnitude corresponds to having @xmath12 superconducting flux quanta per lattice plaquette .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) corresponds to taking into account only the external magnetic field and neglecting the field of weak currents flowing in the junctions .",
    "planar magnets with odd number of antiferromagnetic bonds per plaquette @xcite are also described by the fully frustrated xy models .",
    "the recent renewal of the interest to the fully frustrated josephson junction arrays has been related to their possible application for the creation of topologically protected quantum bits .",
    "@xcite    in a typical situation , the energy of each of the josephson junctions forming an array as a function of the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath14 is indeed rather accurately described by the function ( [ v ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a magnetically frustrated network of thin superconducting wires can be described @xcite in the london limit ( when the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter can be assumed to be constant along the wires ) by the same hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath15 replaced by the so - called berezinskii - villain interaction @xcite having the same symmetry and periodicity as @xmath15 , see appendix [ bv ] .",
    "the fully frustrated xy model with the berezinskii - villain interaction is more convenient for a theoretical analysis , because its partition function can be rigorously transformed into that of a coulomb gas with half - integer charges @xcite ( appendix [ bv ] gives more details ) .",
    "in a number of cases it can be expected that the main features of the frustrated xy models with the conventional and with the berezinskii - villain interaction are the same .",
    "the ground states of the fully frustrated xy models are characterized by the coexistence of the continuous @xmath16 degeneracy ( related to the possibility of the simultaneous rotation of all phases ) with a discrete one , whose nature depends on the structure of the lattice .",
    "accordingly , the fully frustrated xy models allow in addition to the phase transition related to unbinding of vortex pairs also for the existence of other phase transitions related to the disordering of the discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "the main question in such a situation is what is the sequence and the nature of these phase transitions .",
    "the most thoroughly studied examples of the fully frustrated xy models are the models on square and triangular lattices . in both of them",
    "the ground states are characterized by a regular alternation of the plaquettes with positive and negative vorticities .",
    "accordingly , the discrete degeneracy of the ground states is two - fold , that is , the simplest one which is possible .",
    "however , it took about two decades before it was firmly understood @xcite why the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition related to unbinding of vortex pairs has to take place in these models at lower temperatures than the second phase transition related to the proliferation of the ising - type domain walls . due to a strong mutual influence of the two transitions ( which are situated rather close to each other ) , a convincing numerical demonstration of the ising nature of one of them has required very substantial efforts .",
    "@xcite before that",
    "quite a number of works appeared claiming that this transition has a non - ising critical behavior , which later has been demonstrated to be a finite - size effect .",
    "the properties of the fully frustrated xy model on a a honeycomb lattice are not so well understood .",
    "the family of its ground state is known to have an infinite discrete degeneracy , @xcite which can be conveniently described in terms of the formation of zero - energy domain walls parallel to each other .",
    "@xcite the analysis of the half - integer coulomb gas on a triangular lattice ( the dual representation of the considered xy model ) has revealed @xcite that in this system the formation of a domain with a different charge pattern can cost only a finite energy even when the size of this domain is arbitrary large .",
    "this has led the authors of ref . to the conclusion on the absence of a long - range order at any nonzero temperature @xmath17 .",
    "this conclusion is not directly applicable to the fully frustrated xy model with interaction ( [ v ] ) because at @xmath18 the zero - energy domain walls acquire a positive free energy @xmath19 originating from the difference in the free energy of the continuous fluctuations ( spin waves ) .",
    "@xcite however , the effect is very weak and according to the estimates in ref .",
    "can manifest itself only if the size of the system @xmath20 substantially exceeds @xmath21 , which makes it unobservable in real and numerical experiments on systems with @xmath22 .",
    "nonetheless , up to now it has remained unclarified if in situations when @xmath19 is absent ( as it happens in the case of the berezinskii - villain interaction ) or can be neglected , the system can still demonstrate a phase transition related to the continuous degrees of freedom or the destruction of the long - range order of in terms of vortex pattern prevents the possibility of such a transition .",
    "the available numerical data @xcite does not lead to a unique conclusion and allows for different interpretations , including the existence of a spin - glass transition .",
    "@xcite    in this work we reexamine the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice with the aim of finding an answer to this question , as well as establishing what is the nature of the phase transition ( transitions ) induced by the positiveness of @xmath19 .",
    "our main conclusions can be formulated as follows .",
    "even when @xmath19 is equal to zero ( or can be neglected ) , this does not mean the complete absence of the long - range order at any nonzero temperature .",
    "in a such a situation , the long - range order is related not to the dominance of a particular vortex pattern , but to a preferable orientation of the zero - energy domain walls .",
    "the phase transition leading to the destruction of this long - range order is related to the appearance of a finite concentration of unpaired fractional vortices with topological charges @xmath23 .",
    "the fractional vortices are located at the nodes of the domain - wall network existing in the system with @xmath24 at any temperature , however at low temperatures they have to be bound in pairs , which imposes the existence of a preferable orientations of domain walls .    in the model with the conventional interaction which at @xmath18 has small but positive @xmath19 ( induced by spin - waves ) ,",
    "the increase of temperature leads to the sequence of three phase transitions .",
    "however , the two of them require for their observation very large systems with @xmath25 . in physical systems like magnetically frustrated josephson junction arrays and superconducting wire networks , the value of @xmath26 will be lower due to the presence of other mechanisms for the removal of the accidental degeneracy .",
    "although the lowest - temperature phase transition ( whose critical temperature tends to zero when @xmath27 ) consists in the appearance of domain walls , it does not lead to the destruction of the long - range order in terms of vortex pattern . on the contrary",
    ", it is related to a partial restoration of the continuous @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "this phase transition belongs to the ising universality class , whereas the two other transitions mentioned above must be of the first order .",
    "a more detailed summary of the phase diagram of the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice and of the properties of different phases and phase transitions is presented in the concluding sec .",
    "it also compares our results with that of other works and discusses their relevance for some experimental situations and other uniformly frustrated xy models that allow for the formation of parallel zero - energy domain walls .",
    "when speaking about both global and local minima of the hamiltonian of an xy model it is convenient to characterize them in terms of vorticities of different plaquettes .",
    "vorticity @xmath28 of plaquette @xmath9 can be defined as the directed sum over the perimeter of this plaquette of the gauge - invariant phase differences reduced to the interval @xmath29 . here and",
    "below we use greek indices for labelling the plaquettes , each of which can be associated with a particular site of the triangular lattice @xmath30 dual to the original honeycomb lattice @xmath31 .    in the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice variables",
    "@xmath28 can acquires values @xmath32 . since the main role in the thermodynamics is played by the minima of hamiltonian ( [ ffxy ] ) with @xmath33 ( as well as by fluctuations in the vicinities of these minima ) , one often speaks not about vorticities but about chiralities of different plaquettes .",
    "the knowledge of the chiralities of all plaquettes is sufficient for restoring ( up to a global rotation ) the values of phase variables @xmath34 in the minimum of the hamiltonian which can be associated with this particular configuration of chiralities .    in all ground states of the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice",
    "the plaquettes with different signs of chirality are separated by the bonds with , whereas the plaquettes with the same sign of chirality are separated by the bonds with @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ groundstates ] showing some of the ground states the plaquettes with positive ( negative ) chirality are shaded ( unshaded ) , whereas the bonds with @xmath36 are shown by arrows . on any bond with an arrow",
    ", @xmath37 is equal to @xmath38 if the arrow is directed from site @xmath2 to site @xmath39 and to @xmath40 in the opposite case .",
    "[ groundstates](a ) shows an example of the ground state with the simplest possible structure . in this state",
    "the plaquettes with the same sign of vorticity form parallel straight stripes .",
    "accordingly , such states are called below the striped states .",
    "the set of striped states is characterized by a sixfold discrete degeneracy related to the possibilities of shifting and rotating vortex pattern .",
    "naturally , it also has the continuous @xmath16 degeneracy related to the simultaneous rotation of all phases , but in the following the term `` striped state '' will always refer just to the configuration of chiralities , without specifying the phases .",
    "striped states allow for the formation of domain walls ( separating different realizations of such states ) which cost no energy .",
    "@xcite an example of such a zero - energy domain wall ( zedw ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates](b ) .",
    "an arbitrary number of zedws separated by arbitrary distances can be introduced into the system in parallel to each other , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates](c ) .    the only possible intersection of zedws which does not cost extra energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates](d ) . since each zedw can be ascribed a particular direction in accordance with the orientation of the angle made by stripes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates ] , it is clear that in a ground state the system can not contain more than one intersection of such a kind and in the case of the periodic boundary conditions even one is impossible .",
    "therefore , a typical ground state contains an irregular sequence of straight zedws which are parallel to each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates](c ) .",
    "the presence of a boundary between two ground states with a finite concentration of zedws and different orientations of these walls would cost an energy proportional to the length of this boundary .",
    "the structure of the ground states is not sensitive to a particular form of the interaction in the hamiltonian of the model , as soon as it is even in @xmath41 and behaves more or less in the same way as @xmath42 [ that is , has the single maximum at @xmath43 and the single minimum at @xmath44 whose width is comparable with the period of @xmath15 ] .",
    "for example , it can be also the berezinskii - villain interaction defined by eq .",
    "( [ v_bv ] ) or the piecewise parabolic interaction ( the zero - temperature limit of the berezinskii - villain interaction ) .",
    "if domain walls separating different striped states would have a positive energy per unit length , at zero temperature the system would be frozen in one of the six striped states . in terms of chiralities",
    "@xmath46 , the order parameter corresponding to the corresponding long - range order ( lro ) can be written as @xmath47 here and below @xmath48 denotes the positions of the sites @xmath9 of the dual triangular lattice",
    "@xmath30 which can be associated with the plaquettes of the original honeycomb lattice @xmath31 , whereas @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) are the three reciprocal vectors of @xmath52 . in any of the striped states one of the three sums",
    "@xmath53 grows with size of the system as @xmath54 ( @xmath55 being the total number of the plaquettes in the system ) , whereas the two other are equal to zero .",
    "the correlation function @xmath56 where the average is taken over the six striped vortex patterns , has an oscillating behavior .",
    "namely , if triangular lattice @xmath52 is partitioned into four equivalent triangular sublattices , then @xmath57 is equal to 1 when @xmath9 and @xmath58 belong to the same sublattice and to @xmath59 when they belong to different sublattices .    when the domain walls shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates ] cost no energy , the oscillating behavior ( without a decay at ) of the correlation function ( [ cch ] ) ( where the average now has to be taken over the infinite set of the ground states ) is retained only when @xmath9 and @xmath58 belong to the same column of sites on @xmath52 , that is , when vector @xmath60 is directed along @xmath61 , one of the three lattice vectors of @xmath52 ( @xmath62 ) . in such a case , in one third of the ground states the line connecting @xmath9 and @xmath58 can not be crossed by any domain walls and therefore the product @xmath63 depends only on the distance between @xmath9 and @xmath58 . for all other directions of @xmath60 , the correlations of @xmath46 and @xmath64 are absent , which leads to @xmath65 this means that the long - range order in terms of @xmath66 is destroyed .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize explicitly that the dependence ( [ s^2 ] ) is not a consequence of algebraic correlations of @xmath46 as it could seem from its form , but has a different origin explained above .",
    "however , it is not hard to note that the destruction of the long - range order is not complete . in the presence of a random sequence of straight parallel zedws ,",
    "the system contains the domains of only four different striped states out of six , whereas the two other vortex patterns ( with stripes parallel to the direction of the domain walls ) are not represented at all .",
    "therefore , in a typical ground state the system still possesses a long - range order .",
    "the most evident interpretation of this order consists in associating it with the direction of zedws .    instead of really monitoring the direction of domain walls ( whose identification requires analyzing chirality patterns in rhombic clusters formed by four neighboring plaquettes )",
    "an order parameter sensitive to the direction of domain walls can be introduced by studying the distribution of energy between the bonds with different orientations . in a typical ground state the average energy of the bonds whose direction is perpendicular to the orientation of domain walls is equal to @xmath67 , whereas for the bonds with two other orientations it is equal to @xmath68 < v(\\pi/4)$ ] .",
    "this allows one to introduce an order parameter as @xmath69v(\\theta_{jj'})\\;,\\ ] ] where the value of @xmath70 depends on the orientation of the bond @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the vanishing of the energy of domain walls does not lead to the complete destruction of the long - range order in the system and one can expect that there should occur a phase transition related to the destruction of the long - range order described by order parameter @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath71 is proportional to the area of the system also when one of the six striped vortex pattern is a dominant one .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath72 , order parameter @xmath71 does not allow to distinguish between two vortex patterns which differ from each other by changing the signs of all chiralities .",
    "when speaking about phase correlations , one should not forget that a change of gauge leads to the multiplication of @xmath73 $ ] by some phase factor . in accordance with that",
    ", a gauge - invariant description of phase correlations can be achieved by paying attention only to the absolute values of the standard correlation functions . for taking into account the peculiarities of the considered model",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the set of gauge - invariant phase correlation functions defined as @xmath74\\rangle|\\,\\ ] ] and numbered by positive integer @xmath75 .",
    "another approach to introducing gauge - invariant phase correlation functions involves considering two identical but completely independent replicas of the system .",
    "@xcite    if domain walls separating different striped states would have a positive energy per unit length , at zero temperature there would exist a true long - range order in terms of phase variables .",
    "in particular , if the honeycomb lattice is partitioned into @xmath76 equivalent triangular sublattices , for any two sites @xmath2 and @xmath77 belonging to the same sublattice , @xmath78 would be equal to @xmath79 for any integer @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath75 is a multiple of eight ( @xmath80 with integer @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 would be equal to @xmath79 for any pair of sites .",
    "this is evident already from the fact that for @xmath83 the factors @xmath84 are always equal to @xmath79 .",
    "for evident reasons , the presence of a random sequence of straight domain walls separating different striped states can not change the behavior of @xmath85 with @xmath80 , which remain identically equal to @xmath79 .",
    "however , it leads to an exponential decay of @xmath86 for @xmath87 for all directions except those parallel to @xmath88 .",
    "for these special directions , all phase correlation functions with @xmath89 have an oscillating behavior . like with chiralities ,",
    "when one calculates the averages of the squares of certain fourier transforms of @xmath90 over all grounds states , they diverge in a typical ground state proportionally to the area of the system , but this should not be taken for the signature of the algebraic correlations of @xmath90 .",
    "the infinite degeneracy of the ground states which manifests itself through the possibility of the formation of zedws is of the accidental nature ( _ i.e. _ , it is not imposed by the symmetries of the system ) .",
    "accordingly , it can removed by the addition of some small interactions preserving the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is also removed at a finite temperature when one takes into account the free energy of the continuous fluctuations ( spin waves ) .",
    "this mechanism for the removal of an accidental degeneracy @xcite is often referred to as  order from disorder \" . in systems with a continuous degeneracy",
    "it is usually sufficient to compare the contributions from the harmonic fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to that , in the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice the free energy of the harmonic fluctuations is exactly the same for all ground states of the model .",
    "@xcite this is a consequence of a hidden symmetry existing in the hamiltonian describing such fluctuations .",
    "@xcite the difference in the spin - waves free energy appears only when one goes beyond the harmonic approximation .",
    "the analysis of the third- and the fourth - order anharmonic terms reveals that the spin - wave free energy is minimal for the striped states whereas the presence of zedws adds to the free energy of the system a positive term roughly proportional to the total length of the walls .",
    "@xcite this allows one to ascribe to domain walls the free energy per unit length @xmath91 where by unit length we mean the lattice constant of the dual triangular lattice @xmath92 . in terms of @xmath92 , the lengths of all walls are integer .",
    "the positiveness of @xmath19 suggests that in the thermodynamic limit the free energy of a domain wall crossing the whole system is infinite and therefore at the lowest temperatures ( at which the positiveness of @xmath93 is not killed by other types of fluctuations ) such walls must be absent .",
    "this ensures the existence of the long - range order corresponding to the dominance of one of the six equivalent striped vortex patterns . on the other hand , at any nonzero temperature the presence of spin waves leads to an algebraic decay of the correlation functions describing phase correlations .    in terms of chiralities @xmath94 ( defined on sites @xmath9 of the dual triangular lattice )",
    "the structure of the striped state is exactly the same as that of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic ising model on a triangular lattice with an additional weak antiferromagnetic interaction of second neighbors .",
    "@xcite in this model there exist two different scenarios for the disordering the ordered state , @xcite the choice between which depends on the relations between the coupling constants .",
    "the basic scenario consist in having a single first - order transition leading to the formation of an isotropic domain wall network mixing the domains of all six striped states .",
    "this leads to the complete loss of the long - range order .",
    "it is interesting that this phase transition takes place when the free energy of a domain wall ( per unit length ) is still positive and not when it vanishes .",
    "however , for some relations between the coupling constants the first - order transition related to the formation of a domain wall network can be preceded by a continuous phase transition related to vanishing of the free energy of double domain walls .",
    "this phase transition leads only to a partial loss of the long - range order .",
    "namely , above it the threefold degeneracy with respect to the directions of stripes still persists , but the system consists of alternating domains of the two striped states with the same orientation of the stripes . @xcite",
    "the existence of different options suggests that in the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice , the conclusion on how the disordering of the striped state takes place also should be based on the comparison of different mechanisms for disordering .",
    "in particular , it still remains to be established what is the nature of the first ( with the increase in temperature ) phase transition induced by the extreme smallness of the domain wall free energy and whether it leads to the complete loss of the long - range order , or only to its partial loss which leaves a place for another phase transition ( or transitions ) .    in order to answer these questions we have to understand what is the most efficient mechanism for the proliferation of domain walls . and",
    "since the decrease of the free energy of domain walls is induced by the presence on them of point - like defects we have to find the point - like defects which play the dominant role in the development of the domain - wall fluctuations .",
    "as any other xy model , the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice allows for the formation of conventional vortices with integer topological charges . in particular , a vortex with topological charge @xmath95 is created when the sign of chirality of some plaquette is flipped in comparison with what it would be in a ground state . on any contour surrounding the core of a vortex with topological charge @xmath96 the deviations of gauge - invariant phase differences @xmath97 from the values they would have in a ground state ( @xmath98 or @xmath99 ) sum up to @xmath100 .    at low temperatures vortices with integer topological charges",
    "can be present in the system only in the form of small neutral pairs whose concentration at @xmath101 has to be exponentially low .",
    "below we demonstrate that all phase transitions in the considered model take place at @xmath101 , when the bound pairs of integer vortices are exponentially rare and , accordingly , have no influence on the properties of the system . for this reason",
    "the presence of such pairs can be neglected .",
    "in addition to conventional vortices , in frustrated xy models there also can exist fractional vortices localized on corners and intersections of domain walls .",
    "@xcite in situation when the energy of domain walls connecting different fractional vortices is exactly equal to zero , the energies of neutral pairs of fractional vortices will be much lower than that of pairs of conventional vortices .",
    "accordingly , one can then expect the neutral pairs of fractional vortices to be the most important finite - energy excitations at the lowest temperatures .      in any ground state of the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice",
    "each plaquette has exactly two nearest neighbors with the same sign of chirality and four with the opposite sign .",
    "in such a situation the simplest idea of having a point - like excitation consists in constructing a configuration in which one ( and only one ) of the plaquettes has a wrong number of neighbors with the same sign of chirality .",
    "indeed , such configurations can be constructed , see fig .",
    "[ fvortices ] , where as in other figures below the plaquettes with positive ( negative ) chiralities are marked by the presence ( absence ) of a shading .    in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fvortices](a ) the plaquette denoted by the sign plus has three neighbors with the same sign of chirality ( instead of two ) , whereas the analogous plaquette in fig .",
    "[ fvortices](b ) one neighbor . in both configurations , in order to have the correct number of neighbors with the same sign of chirality on all other plaquettes , three zedws have to merge at the defect .",
    "an important property of these defects is that they are fractional vortices with topological charges @xmath102 . in any ground state , the correct value of vorticity on each plaquette",
    "is achieved because on all four bonds separating it from the plaquettes with the opposite sign of vorticity variables @xmath37 are equal either to @xmath38 or to @xmath40 and sum up to @xmath103 .",
    "when the number of neighbors with the same sign of vorticity is equal to one or three ( instead of two ) , there appears a misfit of @xmath99 which has to be distributed over all six bonds surrounding the corresponding plaquette .",
    "the same misfit is also present on any closed contour surrounding the defect independently of the size of this contour , from where it is clear that the deviations of variables @xmath37 from the values they would have in a ground state ( 0 or @xmath99 ) decay with the distance from the defect @xmath104 as @xmath105 .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic divergence of the energy of a single defect and a logarithmic ( at large distances ) interaction between such defects . in accordance with their topological charges",
    "@xmath106 , the logarithmical interaction of the fractional vortices in the considered problem is @xmath107 times smaller than that of conventional vortices with topological charges @xmath95 .",
    "the defect shown in fig .",
    "[ fvortices](c ) ( in which the central plaquette has no neighbors with the same sign of vorticity ) can be considered as an overlap of two defects of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fvortices](b ) .",
    "this statement applies both to the number of zedws which meet at the defect and to its vorticity .            in fig .",
    "[ fvortices ] the positions of fractional vortices are denoted by the sign plus , because in all configurations shown in this figure the topological charge of the fractional vortex is positive . below the positions of fractional vortices",
    "are denoted by pluses and minuses in accordance with the signs of their topological charges . in the case of the berezinskii - villain interaction ,",
    "it is possible to exactly express the energy of any configuration of chiralities in terms of the pairwise interaction between fractional vortices ( see appendix [ cg ] ) .",
    "now we know how the fractional vortices look like and the next step is to find how two fractional vortices can be combined to form a neutral pair with a finite energy . since each zedw can be ascribed a particular direction as shown in figs .",
    "[ groundstates ] and [ fvortices ] , each fractional vortex can be considered either as a  sink \" [ the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fvortices](a ) ] or as a  source \" [ the configurations in figs .",
    "[ fvortices](b ) and [ fvortices](c ) ] of domain walls .",
    "apparently in the case of periodic boundary conditions the number of sources must be equal to the number of sinks [ naturally , for the correct balance the configurations of the type shown in [ fvortices](c ) have to be counted as double sources ] .",
    "it is impossible to construct an isolated pair of fractional vortices from two sink configurations because the domain walls meeting in them would have to intersect each other , which would imply the existence of other defects close by .",
    "for the same reason it is impossible to construct an isolated pair from two double sources .",
    "on the other hand , although locally a neutral pair consisting of two sources looks like a legitimate object ( see fig .",
    "[ pairs - a ] ) , such pairs can not appear because in the absence of unpaired fractional vortices there will be no sinks to compensate for these sources [ in that respect they resemble the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates](d ) ] .",
    "therefore , in a domain wall network formed by small pairs of fractional vortices , each pair should consist of a source and a sink .",
    "such pairs can be divided into three classes , exemplified in fig .",
    "[ pairs - b ] .",
    "the first of them is an intersection of a single zedw and a double domain wall , that is , a pair of parallel zedws ( which change their orientation after crossing a single wall ) .",
    "an example of such a pair of fractional vortices is shown in fig .",
    "[ pairs - b](a ) .",
    "the second type of the fractional - vortex pairs are the bends on a double domain wall , see fig .",
    "[ pairs - b](b ) .",
    "for such a pair to be neutral the distance between the two single walls forming the double wall has to be even ( in the considered model it is natural to measure the distance between domain walls in units of @xmath108 , the height of the triangular cell of the dual lattice ) . if the distance between two parallel zedws would be odd ( for example , the minimal distance ) , in the configuration analogous to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ pairs - b](b ) both fractional vortices would be of the same sign .",
    "the third class of the fractional - vortex pairs corresponds to a double domain wall ending on a single domain wall , see fig .",
    "[ pairs - b](c ) . in this case",
    "the distance between the two parallel zedws also has to be even in order to avoid a situation when both fractional vortices in a pair are of the same sign .",

    "the order in which these phases are listed corresponds to the increase in temperature . by the existence of the long - range order ( lro ) in terms of vortex pattern",
    "we mean the selection of one of the six equivalent striped vortex patterns , see fig .",
    "[ groundstates](a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of the long - range order in terms of the domain - walls orientation implies the choice of one of the three preferable orientations of domain walls .",
    "the last three columns describe the behavior of the gauge - invariant phase correlation functions defined by eq .",
    "( [ c_p ] ) .    the first line in table i refers to the behavior of the correlation functions when the averages are calculated over the set of the all ground states of the model .",
    "a typical ground state incorporates an irregular sequence of parallel straight domain walls , which leads to the exponential decay of the chirality correlation function , eq .",
    "( [ cch ] ) , as well as of phase correlation functions @xmath86 with @xmath89 for all directions that are not exactly perpendicular to one of the directions of lattice bonds . nonetheless , the system has the long - range order in terms of domain - walls orientation    at @xmath18 domain walls acquire a finite free energy per unit length given by eq .",
    "( [ fdw ] ) and originating from the difference in the free energy of spin waves .",
    "@xcite at the lowest temperatures this leads to the suppression of infinite domain walls crossing the whole system and the appearance of the long - range order in term of vortex pattern ( phase no . 1 in table i ) .",
    "the system spontaneously chooses one of the six equivalent striped vortex patterns . on the other hand , all phase correlation functions decay algebraically due to the presence of spin waves .",
    "with the increase in temperature , the first phase transition takes place at and is related to the appearance of a sequence of fluctuating double - spaced double domain walls . on the average ,",
    "the direction of these fluctuating walls is perpendicular to the direction of vortex stripes .",
    "this phase transition is continuous with the ising - type behavior in a very narrow critical region and the pokrovsky - talapov behavior in a wider region around the critical one .",
    "although the transition taking place at @xmath228 is related to the appearance of domain walls , above it ( phase no . 2 in table i ) the discrete degeneracy ( related to the long - range order in terms of vortex pattern ) remains the same ( six - fold ) , whereas the decay of the phase correlation function @xmath148 changes from algebraic to exponential .",
    "this happens because the presence of a doubly - spaced double domain wall between two points shifts the phase difference by @xmath139 .",
    "the next phase which appears with the increase in temperature ( phase no . 3 in table i )",
    "has the same symmetry properties as a typical ground state of the model . in particular , in this phase there is no long - range order in terms of vortex pattern .",
    "the main difference with a random sequence of parallel straight domain walls ( characteristic for a typical ground state ) consists in the presence of local defects which shift the positions of these walls but do not change their preferable orientation , see fig . [",
    "network](b ) .",
    "the phase transition to this uniaxial domain - wall network has to be of the first order and can be expected to take place when @xmath17 is around @xmath229 .",
    "the important feature of the uniaxial domain - wall network is that the nodes of this network , which in terms of phase variables correspond to logarithmically interacting fractional vortices , are bound in neutral pairs .",
    "the last phase transition leading to the complete suppression of the long - range order and to exponential decay of all correlation functions can be associated with the appearance of an isotropic domain - wall network in which some fractional vortices ( the nodes of the network ) are not bound in pairs but free . by analyzing how the free energy of such a network depends on typical distance between free fractional vortices",
    "it turns out possible to establish that this transition must be of the first order and has to occur at @xmath230 .",
    "all phase transitions mentioned above take place at temperatures which are much lower than the temperature @xmath231 at which the unbinding of pairs of the conventional vortices ( with integer topological charges ) would take place if any other fluctuations were absent . the existence at such temperatures of an exponentially small concentration of small bound pairs of integer vortices does not lead to any noticeable consequences . on the other hand , at @xmath232 the logarithmic interaction of integer vortices",
    "is screened due to the presence of a finite concentration of free fractional vortices and therefore there are no grounds to expect the existence of an additional phase transition related to the unbinding of integer vortices .",
    "thus we have established that the equilibrium thermodynamics of the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice supports the existence at @xmath18 of four different phases three of which are characterized by the presence of a long - range order . however the observation of some of these phases ( and phase transition between them ) in a real or numerical experiment may turn out to be a big problem .    in particular , at @xmath233 , the complete suppression of domain walls crossing the whole system ( induced by the spin - wave contribution to their free energy , see sec .",
    "[ spinwaves ] ) is achieved only in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath234 . in a finite system with linear size @xmath235 , in order to have the average number of such walls smaller than one , the size of the system should be larger than @xmath236 , the temperature - dependent solution of the equation @xmath237 at the point of the phase transition related to the appearance of infinite double - spaced double domain walls , .",
    "this means that numerical simulations of systems with @xmath238 does not allow one to observe the phase with suppressed domain walls independently of whether it is possible or not to reach thermal equilibrium at @xmath239 .",
