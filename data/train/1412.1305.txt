    "[ fig : mechanism](a ) , the internal spontaneous magnetization splits the flat @xmath24 bands into two bands , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath24 means that the bands consist of the @xmath18 orbitals of the a - sublattice bi atoms .",

    "fig : mechanism](b ) ) is critical , which provides a pivot for the subsequent intrinsic rashba soc . both of these two constituents result in an inverted band gap as shown in fig .",

    "the buckled honeycomb geometry of the bi monolayer makes it possible to saturate the chemical bonds of bi atoms on only one sublattice .",
    "therefore , it is a very promising that a h - h bi honeycomb monolayer may be synthesized by chemical reaction in solvents or by exposure of a bi monolayer or ultrathin film to atomic or molecular gases .",
    "an candidate substrate here could be layer materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides ( e.g. mos@xmath3 ) and @xmath65-bn , which stabilize and weakly interact with the h - h bi honeycomb monolayer through van der waals interaction and thus do not alter the band topology of the monolayer .",
