    "two of the main questions about molecular cloud ( mc ) structure and star formation concern the origin of molecular cloud turbulence and of the low efficiency of star formation ( sfe ) .",
    "indeed , the turbulent properties of molecular clouds are remarkably uniform , even in clouds without stellar energy sources ( see , e.g. , mckee 1999 and references therein ) . and , defined as the fraction of the mass in a mc that ends up in stars before the cloud is dispersed , the sfe is well known to be as low as a few percent with respect to the total cloud mass ( see , e.g. , evans 1991 and references therein ) . it is known that turbulence can provide additional support against global gravitational collapse ( chandrasekhar 1951 ; bonazzola et al .",
    "1987 , 1992 ; vzquez - semadeni  & gazol 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , numerical studies have suggested that turbulence is able to prevent the collapse when the energy injection scale is smaller than the jeans length at typical core densities ( lorat , passot & pouquet 1990 ; klessen , heitsch & mac low 2000 , hereafter khm00 ) .",
    "simultaneously , supersonic , compressible turbulence is known to produce `` fragmentation '' , i.e. , the formation of smaller - scale density substructures that can themselves possibly undergo local collapse ( sasao 1973 ; hunter & fleck 1982 ; tohline , bodenheimer & christodolou 1987 ; scalo 1987 ; elmegreen 1993 ; padoan 1995 ; vzquez - semadeni , passot & pouquet 1996 ; khm00 ; padoan et al .",
    "2001 ; heitsch , mac  low & klessen 2001 ) .",
    "padoan ( 1995 ) and khm00 have proposed that turbulent fragmentation has an important role in determining the sfe .",
    "the latter authors have shown that the efficiency in numerical simulations ( measured as the fraction of mass in collapsed objects ) increases as the energy injection scale is increased . however , this result was obtained in simulations with an idealized random forcing applied at specific scales , and ubiquitously in time and space . instead , the turbulence in real mcs is probably injected over a wide range of scales , but at localized sites and times ( scalo 1987 ; norman & ferrara 1996 ; avila - reese & vzquez - semadeni  2001 ) . in this case , the driving scale is not uniquely defined .",
    "also , if molecular clouds form through the collisions of larger - scale streams in the more diffuse ism ( elmegreen 1993 ; ballesteros - paredes , vzquez - semadeni  & scalo 1999 ; vzquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes  & klessen 2002 , hereafter paper i ) , then they can be part of a turbulent cascade originating from much larger scales , and thus the driving scale can be much larger than the jeans length in the molecular clouds ( mac low & ossenkopf ( 2001 ) .",
    "this appears inconsistent with the requirement of a driving scale smaller than the cloud s jeans length in order to maintain a low efficiency .    in paper",
    "i , we have compiled a holistic scenario in which both the turbulence in molecular clouds and the sfe are part of the life cycle of mcs : _ mc turbulence originates from the very process that forms the clouds _ , namely colliding streams in the diffuse ism ( elmegreen 1993 ; ballesteros - paredes  et al.1999 ) , through bending - mode instabilities ( hunter et al .",
    "1986 ; vishniac 1994 ; walder & folini 1998 ; klein & woods 1998 ) . in this sense ,",
    "mc turbulence is part of a compressible _ and lossy _ cascade which may originate at intermediate scales in the galactic disk ( @xmath1 kpc ) from various instabilities ( parker 1966 ; toomre 1964 ; elmegreen 1991 ) , supernova energy input ( e.g. , mccray & snow 1979 ; maclow 2002 ) , and stellar winds ( norman & silk 1980 ) , and continues towards smaller scales , as the internal turbulence produces yet smaller - scale turbulent compressed layers ( kornreich & scalo 2000 ) .",
    "the compressible cascade has to be lossy because shocks are known to be dissipative by transferring a fraction of the energy involved directly to the dissipative scales ( kadomtsev & petviashvili 1973 ) .",
    "this compressible - cascade regime , however , must end at a `` sonic '' scale , denoted @xmath0 , below which the turbulence internal to the new structures becomes subsonic and therefore can not produce any further subfragmentation ( padoan 1995 ) .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the dissipative ( or `` inner '' ) scale of the turbulence has been reached , but only that at this point the cascade can turn into an incompressible one .",
    "thus , in this scenario , subsonic `` cores '' are the natural end of the _ compressible _ part of the cascade in the ism .",
    "when the turbulence becomes subsonic , it ceases to be a stronger source of global support than thermal pressure , and the jeans criterion can be applied to determine whether a `` core '' is gravitationally unstable and should proceed to collapse ( padoan 1995 ) , or else rebound and merge back into its environment ( elmegreen 1993 ; taylor , morata & williams 1996 ; ballesteros - paredes  et al .  1999 ; vzquez - semadeni , shadmehri & ballesteros - paredes  2002 ) .",
    "this effectively _ sets an upper limit to the sfe _ , because , if globally the cloud is supported by its internal turbulence , only massive enough clumps among those with sizes @xmath2 are susceptible to local collapse ( padoan 1995 ) . in this sense ,",
    "star - forming cores constitute the intersection of the set of subsonic regions with the high - mass , super - jeans _",
    "tail _ of the mass distribution ( padoan 1995 ; ballesteros - paredes  & vzquez - semadeni  1997 ; shadmehri , vzquez - semadeni  & ballesteros - paredes  2001 ) .",
    "in particular , padoan ( 1995 ) gave a semi - phenomenological theory for the efficiency and mass distribution of proto - stellar cores in turbulent molecular clouds ( recently extended by padoan & nordlund 2002 ) .",
    "in that work , however , he considered only a power - law turbulent spectrum , neglecting the necessary existence of inner and outer scales , and the role of the energy injection scale , which was proposed to be crucial by lorat et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and khm00 .    in this letter , besides putting together and advancing the above global scenario , we present (  [ sec : num_exp ] ) a first set of numerical tests supporting it , by showing that the scale @xmath0 indeed plays a crucial role in limiting the sfe .",
    "clearly , this is only a partial ingredient , as the mass distribution in the flow is also expected to be crucial ( padoan 1995 )",
    ". our experiments also support the notion of the dual role of turbulence in providing support to large scales while promoting small - scale collapse , as we discuss in  [ sec : discussion ] , where we also give a re - interpretation of the results of khm00 in the framework of our scenario .",
    "we consider a set of 12 numerical experiments similar to those reported by khm00 .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for details ( see also klessen & burkert 2000 , 2001 ) . here",
    "we just mention that they are smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of non - magnetic turbulent flows using 205,379 particles , with self - gravity , and random forcing applied only at wavenumbers in a narrow interval @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the driving wavenumber , @xmath5 is the computational box size and @xmath6 is the driving scale .",
    "the simulations are carried out in non - dimensional units , in which there are 64 thermal jeans masses ( with respect to the mean density ) in the computational box , the time unit is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the free fall time , the sound speed is @xmath9 , and the mean density is @xmath10 .",
    "a constant kinetic energy input rate is used , with an amplitude chosen to maintain a fixed level of turbulent kinetic energy @xmath11 . for our analysis",
    ", the sph data are interpolated onto a cubic grid of @xmath12 cells , but note that the effective resolution of the sph method in the density peaks ( cores ) is higher than that .",
    "the runs are labeled mnemonically as m@xmath13k@xmath14 , where @xmath13 denotes the rms mach number and @xmath14 denotes the forcing wavenumber @xmath15 .",
    "the rms mach number @xmath16 and the energy injection scale @xmath6 were taken by khm00 as the controlling parameters in their investigation of the amount of mass in collapsed objects @xmath17 as a function of time for several simulations .",
    "the numerical scheme allows this mass to be measured through the usage of `` sink '' particles , which are particles that replace a collapsing gas clump once it becomes too dense and small to be properly resolved .",
    "a sink particle inherits the combined masses of the replaced sph particles , as well as their linear and angular momenta , and has the ability to continue accreting further sph particles .    in order to investigate the role of the sonic scale @xmath0",
    ", we consider the velocity dispersion - vs .- size relation , together with the mass - accretion histories of the simulations .",
    "the velocity dispersion - size relation we consider is not restricted to the densest , or highest - column density projected structures , as is customary in both oservational ( larson 1981 ; see blitz 1993 for a more recent review ) and numerical ( vzquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes  & rodr ' iguez 1997 ; ostriker , stone & gammie 2001 ; ballesteros - paredes  & mac low 2002 ) astrophysical studies . instead , we consider a subdivision of the whole computational box in regions of size @xmath18 , and measure the velocity dispersion in all such regions .",
    "the mass accretion histories are computed as the fraction of the total mass in collapsed objects ( sink particles ) as a function of time .",
    "figure [ fig : v_r ] shows the velocity dispersion - size relation for all runs . for every run , the solid line shows the average velocity dispersion for all regions of size @xmath18 ; the `` error '' bars indicate the range of values of the velocity dispersion exhibited by all regions of size @xmath18 .",
    "the dotted straight lines show an @xmath19 power law , and the dashed horizontal line shows the value of the sound speed .",
    "the sonic scale can be defined as that at which the solid line crosses the sound speed level , and is depicted by a vertical dotted line . because of the large error ( or , more properly , `` scatter '' ) bars in the velocity dispersion , the sonic scale is typically defined only to within factors @xmath20 .",
    "the caveat should be mentioned that the velocity dispersion - size plots we obtain are clearly not power laws , with progressively smaller scales being progressively more deficient in turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "this is in part a consequence of the spatially varying resolution of sph , with low resolution at low density ( in voids ) and high resolution at high density ( in cores ) ( ossenkopf , klessen , & heitsch 2001 ) , and in part a consequence of a power - law range not being expected at scales larger than @xmath21 for the small - driving - scale runs . in any case , the non - power - law nature of the spectrum at small scales implies that our measurements _ overestimate _ @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "figure [ fig : accr_hists ] shows the accretion histories for all runs.it is noteworthy that the accreted mass in most runs ( except the ones with the lowest accretion rates ) eventually saturates at some level .",
    "this phenomenon is extremely interesting in its own right ; it clearly appears to be a real phenomenon , generally seen in simulations that allow following the evolution of the system beyond the formation of individual collapse sites through the use of sink particles ( khm00 ; klessen , burkert & bate 2001 ; klessen 2001 ; bate , bonnell & bromm 2002 ) .",
    "we speculate that it occurs because the local collapse events decrease the mean density of the `` interclump '' medium , making it more difficult to form new collapsing sites from it .",
    "concerns that this saturation level be a numerical artifact dependent of the resolution are dispelled by fig .",
    "6 of khm00 , which shows no clear trend of the saturation level with resolution , but only statistical scatter ( different random initial conditions with the same global parameters show variations of up to a factor of 2 in the final accreted masses ) .",
    "operationally , defining the sfe is not an unambiguous task , because not all runs have had time to saturate yet ( assuming they all eventually do ) .",
    "given that recent studies suggest that clouds have lifetimes of only a few crossing times ( ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "1999 ; elmegreen 2000 ) , we choose to define the sfe as the collapsed mass fraction after two turbulent crossing times ( @xmath22 ) . in the units of the code , these correspond to @xmath23 , 12.5 , 6.7 and 4 for runs with rms mach number @xmath24 , 3.2 , 6 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "however , for the runs with @xmath24 and 3.2 , this time is longer than they have been evolved .",
    "fortunately , the collapsed mass fractions in all these runs have saturated , and so for them we take the saturation value . due to the statistical variation of the collapsed mass fractions",
    "mentioned above , we also put error bars of @xmath25% in the reported values of the sfe .    in order to interpret the results of the simulations , fig.[fig : sfe_vs_all ]",
    "shows the sfe versus @xmath21 ( _ a _ ) , @xmath16 ( _ b _ ) , and @xmath0 ( _ c _ ) for all simulations .",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients for the logarithmic data in figs .",
    "[ fig : sfe_vs_all]a , [ fig : sfe_vs_all]b and [ fig : sfe_vs_all]c are respectively 0.35 , @xmath26 and 0.75 .",
    "showing that indeed the sfe correlates best with the sonic scale @xmath0 .",
    "note that this is in spite of the fact that the relationship between the sfe and @xmath0 is clearly not a power law , but instead saturates at large @xmath0 .",
    "a change of variable @xmath27 gives the fit shown by the solid curve in fig.[fig : sfe_vs_all]c , with a much tighter correlation coefficient of 0.86 .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation with @xmath16 is also significant .",
    "we discuss this in the next section .",
    "although in the previous section we have fitted a smooth curve to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfe_vs_all]_c _ , actually it appears as if there are two functional dependences ( `` modes '' ) of the sfe on @xmath0 in this plot : for @xmath28 , the sfe is nearly a power - law on @xmath0 , while it is roughly constant ( within a factor of 2 ) for @xmath29 .",
    "all the points in the former regime correspond to cases with @xmath30 or 10 , which are globally supported by the turbulence , while most of the points in the latter regime correspond to @xmath24 and 3.2 , which are globally unsupported . nevertheless , the large - scale driven ( @xmath31 ) high-@xmath16 cases appear to be at the crossover between the two regimes .",
    "this demonstrates the suggested dual nature of the turbulence ( sasao 1973 ; falgarone , puget & prault 1992 ; vzquez - semadeni  & passot 1999 ; khm00 ) : globally supported runs can be induced to behave as unsupported ones when the bulk of the turbulent energy is at the largest scales .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that these two `` modes '' correspond to the isolated and clustered observed modes of sf . in this case",
    ", our results suggest that the two would not be physically separated modes , but simply represent a continuous transition from one functional dependence of the sfe on @xmath0 to the other , as the domain transits from behaving as if globally supported to behaving as if globally unsupported .",
    "we see also that , even in the globally unsupported case , the efficiency is below unity because of the saturation described above . in this case",
    ", turbulence would only provide the seeds for the internal fragmentation of the collapsing molecular cloud region ( see , e.g. , klessen et al .",
    "1998 ; klessen 2001 ) , the efficiency being more strongly dependent on stellar feedback to destroy the cloud .",
    "further testing is necessary in order to confirm the correspondence between the two regimes found here and the observationally identified isolated and clustered modes .",
    "concerning the resolution of the numerical scheme , as mentioned above , @xmath0 is overestimated at small scales by our simulations . moreover , in the absence of numerical diffusion , one would expect the density peaks to become narrower as well , possibly increasing the number of them that go into collapse , and thus increasing the sfe .",
    "thus , in general we expect the correlation seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfe_vs_all]c to be shallower if the diffusivity is decreased .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect significant qualitative changes in our results .",
    "our reinterpretation in terms of @xmath0 eliminates the apparent inconsistency implied by previous works that a low sfe would seem to require a small driving scale , yet the turbulence in molecular clouds appears to be generally driven from larger scales . indeed ,",
    "our results show that a small driving scale alone is not enough to prevent collapse if it is too weak , while driving at large scales can still decrease the efficiency if it is strong enough , as pointed out by khm00 . that is",
    ", the controlling parameter is not the driving scale nor the rms mach number alone , but instead their combined action expressed as the energy content at the sonic scale .",
    "previous studies did not consider large - scale - driven cases with a strong enough turbulence level to decrease the sfe .",
    "a few final remarks : 1 ) the mechanism sketched here is expected to operate _ in addition _ to any other mechanism limiting the sfe based on energy feedback from the massive stars , which can disrupt the parent cloud .",
    "2 ) the occurrence of a saturation of the accreted mass implies that clouds could not achieve 100% sfe even if they had arbitrarily large amounts of time available , provided the turbulence level is kept constant .",
    "this is because _ local _ collapse uses up part of the mass , rendering the remaining gas more diffuse and easy to disperse .",
    "thus , _ partial dispersion may also be part of the natural course of evolution of molecular clouds_. 3 ) in this work we have neglected the effect of the magnetic fields . although their effect certainly must be incorporated in a full theory , the mechanism discussed here is capable of regulating the sfe without relying on their presence , depending only on the spatial redistribution of the physical quantities in a compressible turbulent flow .",
    "this is particularly relevant upon recent suggestions that molecular clouds may be super - alfvnic ( padoan & nordlund 1999 ) and that cores are in general supercritical ( nakano 1998 ; hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin 2001 ; bourke et al .  2001 ;",
    "crutcher , heiles & troland 2002 ) .",
