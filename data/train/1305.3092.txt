    "the study of submanifolds in an affine symplectic space originated in the work of s.s .",
    "chern and h.c .",
    "wang @xcite .",
    "the issue has however remained silent for many years , before being taken up on several occasions in recent literature @xcite .",
    "the renewed interest in this topic raises in connection with the modern approach to the moving frame method @xcite and in investigations on integrable evolutions of curves in affine spaces or in the grassmannians of the lagrangian linear subspaces of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the specific nature of the geometry of an affine symplectic space stems from the fact that the linear symplectic group does not act transitively on the grassmannians of the linear subspaces of @xmath1 .",
    "already in the case of curves , the phenomenology is rather varied and depends on the typology of the osculating spaces along the curve which can be symplectic , isotropic , coisotropic or lagrangian .",
    "this makes a non - trivial task the construction of a moving frame that works effectively in all possible cases , or say for all linearly full curve .",
    "so far , in the literature only the generic case ( i.e. curves whose osculating spaces of even order are symplectic ) has been investigated , while those cases which are more specific to the symplectic setting have not been examined .    in the present paper we focus on lagrangian curves",
    "they are the curves whose osculating spaces of order @xmath2 are isotropic .",
    "first we provide an appropriate moving frame for those curves .",
    "it was claimed in @xcite that lagrangian curves were singular and required higher order moving frame .",
    "such is not the case .",
    "we exhibit a frame that is of minimal order for generic curves but specializes well for lagrangian curves .",
    "second , with the moving frame at hand , we investigate the geometry of some remarkable lagrangian curves .",
    "we first provide a classification of lagrangian curves with constant symplectic curvatures .",
    "we then examine the notion of geodesics for lagrangian curves .",
    "it turns out to be a subclass of the lagrangian curves with constant curvatures .    in our treatment",
    "we only consider the four dimensional case .",
    "this choice is due to two main reasons : minimize the computational complications when constructing the moving frame and exploit the specificity of the four - dimensional case .",
    "we shall indeed disclose some interesting interconnections with the deformation problem @xcite for plane curves and with the conformal geometry of null curves in a @xmath3-dimensional pseudo - riemannian space form ( minkowski , de sitter or anti - de sitter ) .",
    "this latter topic has its own significance in mathematics , theoretical physics and biophysics @xcite .",
    "the material is organized into five sections . in section  [ symplectic ]",
    "we recall basic facts on the affine symplectic geometry of @xmath0 and define the symplectic curvatures . in section  [ lagrangian ]",
    "we study lagrangian curves .",
    "they are characterized by the fact that their osculating planes are lagrangian subspaces of @xmath0 and demonstrate intriguing connections to conformal and affine geometry .",
    "lagrangian curves have a natural parametrization through which a notion of symplectic length can be defined .",
    "we then examine their link to the conformal geometry of the grassmannian of the lagrangian vector subspaces of @xmath0 . in section  [ techno ]",
    "we face the construction of a moving frame for linearly full curves in @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly outline the moving frame technology for parametrized submanifolds following @xcite .",
    "it is then applied to build the moving frame associated to a minimal - order section for the action of the affine symplectic group on the fourth - order jet space of linearly full parameterized curves of @xmath0 , regardless of the specific properties of the osculating spaces .",
    "we will also examine the cross - section corresponding to a gram - schmid process . such a construction can be extended to provide appropriate moving frame in any dimension .",
    "in section  [ remarkable ] we classify lagrangian curves with constant symplectic curvatures and we show that , up to affine symplectic transformations , closed lagrangian curves with constant curvatures depend on a rational parameter . based on those closed curve we show how to construct lagrangian tori .",
    "finally , in section  [ geodesics ] we study the symplectic arc - length functional for lagrangian curves and we prove that its critical points form a subset of the lagrangian curves with constant symplectic curvatures .",
    "on @xmath4 we consider the _ standard symplectic form _ @xmath5 where @xmath6    the _ linear symplectic group _ @xmath7 is the group of matrices that preserve @xmath8 : @xmath9 it is a 10 dimensional lie group .",

    "an _ affine symplectic frame _ @xmath41 consists of a point @xmath42 , the origin , and a symplectic basis @xmath43 .",
    "the manifold of all these frames can be identified with @xmath16 , the matrix representation of the affine symplectic group defined as ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "differentiating the maps @xmath44 and taking into account the identities @xmath36 we find @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 for every @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is a basis for the vector space of the left - invariant 1-forms of @xmath50 that is dual to the infinitesimal generators associated to @xmath51 when the action of the one dimensional group determined by @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 .",

    "we discuss the links between lagrangian curves in @xmath0 and null curves in a @xmath3-dimensional lorentzian space form .",
