    "quantum entanglement is one of the essential ingredients in quantum information processing tasks which include superdense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite , and one way quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it was shown that such protocols can provide advantage over the corresponding classical protocols @xcite . moreover ,",
    "classical information as well as quantum state transfer via quantum channels have been successfully realized in the laboratory over reasonably large distances @xcite .",
    "any communication protocol involves three major steps  ( 1 ) encoding of the information in a physical system , ( 2 ) sending the physical system through a physical channel , and ( 3 ) decoding the information . in this paper , we are interested in the communication scheme which deals with the transfer of classical information encoded in a quantum state shared between distant parties , and is known as quantum dense coding ( dc ) @xcite .",
    "capacity of the dense coding protocol have been evaluated in several scenarios involving a single receiver .",
    "these include the cases of a single sender as well as multiple senders and in both noiseless and noisy scenarios @xcite .",
    "an important tool here is the holevo bound on the accessible information for ensembles of quantum states @xcite .",
    "the situations when there are multiple senders and/or multiple receivers are involved , have been termed as distributed quantum dense coding @xcite .",
    "the capacity in the noiseless case for two receivers has been estimated in @xcite , where the holevo - like upper bound on locally accessible information for ensembles of quantum states of bipartite systems was used @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the capacity of distributed quantum dense coding for two receivers in the noisy case .",
    "the receivers are allowed to perform local ( quantum ) operations and classical communication ( locc ) , and we term the communication protocol as the locc - dc protocol and the corresponding capacity as the locc - dc capacity .",
    "we begin by finding an upper bound on the capacity for arbitrary noisy channels between the senders and the receivers .",
    "a tighter bound in closed form is obtained for the case of covariant channels @xcite .",
    "when the shared state is a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite and when the noisy channels are among the amplitude damping , phase damping , or the pauli channels , the upper bounds on the locc - dc capacities are explicitly evaluated .",
    "furthermore , we relate the locc - dc capacity with the multiparty entanglement in the shared state , in both noiseless and noisy cases .",
    "we had recently observed in the case of several senders and a single receiver that noise in the channel inverts relative capability of information transfer in dense coding between generic multiparty pure quantum states and the corresponding generalized ghz ( gghz ) states @xcite .",
    "here we find that such inversion does not take place in the case of two receivers ( and several senders ) : the gghz state provides better classical information - carrying capacity for both noiseless and noisy cases in comparison to a significantly high fraction of pure states in the corresponding hilbert space .",

    "we consider the quantum dense coding protocol with an arbitrary number of senders and two receivers .",

    "the amount of classical information that the senders can send to the receivers depends on four factors ",
    "@xmath7 encoding procedures used by the senders , @xmath8 the probability of the sampling rate of different encodings , @xmath9 properties of channels by which the encoded states have to be sent , and @xmath10 the measurement strategies used by the receivers to decode the message .",
    "let us first concentrate on the case when the decoding procedures which the receivers are allowed to make are global operations .",
    "the capacity of dense coding , in this case , reduces to optimization of the holevo quantity over unitary encodings ( for different encodings , see @xcite ) and probabilities .",
    "the multiparty dc capacity for an arbitrary multiparty state @xmath11 , with n senders , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and two receivers , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , who are in this case together and denoted by @xmath14 , is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimension of the hilbert space of all the senders , and @xmath17 is the von neumann entropy of the density matrix , @xmath18 . in this paper",

    "the receivers , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , now apply an locc protocol in the @xmath35 bipartition to decode the information that the senders have sent .",
    "the locc - dc protocol can be considered for the noiseless channel @xcite , or when the channels from the senders and the receivers are noisy .",
    "we first deal with the general noisy channel and then consider the covariant channel .      in this section ,",
    "our aim is to estimate the capacity when multiple senders send their encoded parts of the shared quantum state to the two receivers by using a general noisy quantum channel . in a realistic situation , the transmission channel can not be kept completely isolated from the environment , and hence noise almost certainly acts on the encoded parts of the senders side while sending their parts through the shared channels .",
    "mathematically , noise in the transmission channel is a completely positive trace preserving map ( cptp ) , @xmath36 , acting on the state space of the senders part of the transmitted state .",

    "it suggests that the gghz state is more robust to noise among four - qubit pure states .",
    "for the case of multiple senders and a single receiver , the gghz state changes its role as one increases noise in the channel that carries the encoded quantum systems from the senders to the receiver @xcite .",

    "here we see that if there are two receivers in the protocol , there is no such role reversal .",
    "the gghz state requires less multiparty entanglement than a generic state to have the same locc dense coding capacity as the generic state . note that this statement in under the assumption that the upper bounds on the locc - dc capacities faithfully mirror the qualitative features of the actual capacities .",
    "the dense coding protocol is a quantum communication scheme which demonstrates that the classical information can be transferred via quantum states more efficiently than any classical protocol .",
    "the `` holevo bound '' is applied to obtain the capacities , when there is a single sender and a single receiver as well as when there are multiple senders and a single receiver .",
    "capacities are known for both noiseless and noisy channels . however",
    ", realistic scenarios of a communication protocol should involve multiple senders and multiple receivers .",
    "the difficulty in such generalization is due to the nonexistence , hitherto , of a holevo - like bound in the multipartite decoding process in the many - receivers scenario in the case of noisy channels . in this paper",
    ", we address the problem of estimating the dense coding capacity , when there are an arbitrary number of senders and two receivers .",
    "in particular , we find an upper bound on the classical capacity of the multipartite quantum channel , when the senders and receivers share a multiparty quantum state and noisy channels , and the receivers are allowed to perform only local quantum operations and classical communication",
    ". a compact form of the upper bound on the capacity is obtained when the noisy channels are covariant .",
    "when the four - party shared state is the ghz state , several paradigmatic noisy channels are considered and the upper bounds on the capacities are determined . finally , we connect the capacity of dense coding with a multiparty entanglement measure , both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios .",
