    "unidirectional charge density wave order ( also called stripe order ) in quantum hall ( qh ) systems has been extensively studied @xcite since the first theoretical prediction in 1996 @xcite and the first experimental observation in high landau levels via the magnetoresistance anisotropy measurement in 1999 @xcite .",
    "many related phenomena , e.g. transport via internal edge state excitations @xcite , liquid crystal phases @xcite , reorientation of stripe directions @xcite , and re - entrant integer quantum hall effect @xcite , have been widely explored both theoretically and experimentally in this context .",
    "stripe formation at fractional filling factors , @xmath3 , corresponding to the composite fermion filling factor , @xmath4 , was also proposed to have energy lower than the conventional laughlin liquid , composite - fermion fermi sea or paired composite - fermion state @xcite .",
    "( throughout this paper @xmath1 is zero or an integer , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the landau level filling factor of the whole system . ) however , most of the stripe phases discussed in the literature so far are formed by electrons in the top ( half - filled ) level of the qh system at high half - odd - integer ( hoi ) filling factors ( e.g. @xmath7 for @xmath8 ) , while the stripe formation at integer filling factors is seldom studied either theoretically or experimentally .",
    "we develop a detailed theory in this paper for possible spontaneous symmetry breaking and associated exotic quantum order in wide - well and double - well integer quantum hall systems by considering all the symmetry properties of the realistic system hamiltonians .",
    "the great advantage of the quantum hall systems in studying quantum critical phenomena is , however , the existence of various energy gaps ( at the fermi level ) which enables us to carry out reasonable energetic calculations ( within a mean - field hartree - fock theory ) to quantitatively check whether the various possible quantum phase transitions and exotic quantum order allowed by symmetry considerations are actually energetically favored in realistic systems .",
    "we therefore construct explicit variational wavefunctions for various possible ( exotic ) quantum states , and carry out energetic calculations to find the optimal ground state . using an in - plane parallel magnetic field ( in addition to the perpendicular field necessary in the quantum hall problem ) to tune system parameters , we find a surprisingly rich quantum phase diagram in our systems of interest .",
    "we believe that the symmetry - broken states with exotic quantum order predicted by our theory should be experimentally observable in transport and inelastic light scattering experiments .",
    "we emphasize that the salient feature of our work ( making it particularly significant from the experimental perspective ) is that we not only identify spontaneous symmetry breaking and exotic quantum order allowed by the system hamiltonian , but also carry out hartree - fock energetic calculations to obtain the quantum phase diagrams using realistic system hamiltonians . among the spontaneous symmetry breakings predicted in this paper are , in additional to the usual translational and spin symmetries , the spontaneous breaking of discrete parity symmetry in a number of interesting situations .",
    "very recently , magnetoresistance anisotropy was observed in both doped gaas / algaas @xcite and si / sige @xcite based semiconductor quantum well systems at even integer filling factors , when a strong in - plane magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) , in addition to the perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) producing the 2d landau levels , is applied . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is proposed that the strong in - plane magnetic field increases the electron zeeman energy so much that the highest filled landau level ( with spin down ) has a level crossing with the lowest empty landau level ( with spin up ) , and then a charge density wave ( cdw ) phase may be stabilized by electron coulomb interaction .",
    "our recent work @xcite on the magnetoplasmon energy dispersion of a wide well system in the presence of a strong in - plane magnetic field finds a near mode softening in the spin - flip channel , suggesting the possibility of a spin density wave ( sdw ) instability near the degeneracy point . as a result",
    ", we proposed a spin - charge texture ( skyrmion @xcite ) stripe phase @xcite to explain the magnetoresistance anisotropy observed in the experiments @xcite . in an earlier theoretical work ,",
    "brey @xcite also found a charge density wave instability in a wide well at @xmath11 _ without _ any in - plane magnetic field .",
    "murthy @xcite recently considered the the coexistence of quantum hall order and density wave order in a single well at @xmath12 with zero zeeman energy and strong level mixing .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , however , systematic theoretical analyses of these candidate stripe phases at integer qh systems have not yet been carried out and need to be further developed .",
    "a double well ( bilayer ) quantum hall system is another system where one may see a stripe phase order at integral filling factors . at total filling factor @xmath0 , electrons are equally distributed in the two layers if no gate voltage or in - plane magnetic field is applied .",
    "we note that the bilayer systems of filling factor @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) can be understood to be equivalent to @xmath15 system by electron - hole symmetry in the top filled landau levels , if the landau level mixing is negligible .",
    "therefore all of our results shown in this paper for bilayer @xmath16 quantum hall systems can be applied to @xmath17 system as well .",
    "we will not distinguish these two systems and will mention @xmath16 case only in the rest of this paper .",
    "when the layer separation , @xmath18 , is small compared to the 2d magnetic length , @xmath19 , spontaneous interlayer coherence can be generated by interlayer coulomb interaction even in the absence of any interlayer tunneling @xcite , and the ground state is therefore best understood as a halperin ( 1,1,1 ) coherent phase with finite charge gap @xcite .",
    "when @xmath18 is comparable to or larger than @xmath19 , however , there should be a transition to two decoupled compressible @xmath20 systems or one of the competing many - body phases .",
    "a detailed analysis of all competing phases is still lacking , although it is commonly believed that for @xmath21 there is a direct first order transition from the @xmath22 phase to the compressible states , although for @xmath14 there may be intermediate quantum hall phases with stripe order @xcite .",
    "other more exotic phases , including the ones with electron pairing @xcite , have also been proposed in the literature .",
    "this interlayer coherence and the corresponding goldstone mode of the symmetry - broken phases have been extensively studied theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite in the literature .",
    "in addition to the layer separation , the in - plane magnetic field is another important controlling parameters for the double well qh systems . in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field , an aharonov - bohm phase factor , associated with the gauge invariance ,",
    "has to be considered for the electron tunneling amplitude between the two layers and may cause a commensurate - to - incommensurate ( c - i ) phase transition at a critical magnetic field strength @xcite . such c - i phase transition arises as a result of competition of the interlayer tunneling and coulomb interlayer exchange interaction .",
    "the former favors a commensurate phase , in which the phase of the order parameter winds at a rate fixed by the parallel magnetic field ; whereas the latter favors an incommensurate phase , in which the order parameter is more nearly uniform in space @xcite .",
    "taking into account the stripe order associated with the layer separation ( @xmath18 ) and the spiral order associated with the in - plane magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) the possibility exists for a very complex and rich phase diagram with many competing phases occurring for various values of @xmath18 and @xmath9 in the bilayer double well system at @xmath16 .",
    "following our earlier work based on the collective mode dispersion @xcite , in this paper we carry out the ground state energetic calculation within the hartree - fock approximation to obtain and describe these exotic phases , which break isospin rotation , parity , and/or translational symmetries .",
    "we will also investigate the possibility of stripe formation at the even filling factor , @xmath2 , where a nonstripe canted antiferromagnetic phase ( caf ) has been proposed and extensively studied in the literature @xcite . the goal of our work is to discuss possible symmetry broken exotic quantum phases in bilayer and wide - well quantum hall systems .    in this paper",
    ", we use the idea of isospin to label the two ( nearly ) degenerate energy levels at the fermi energy , and construct trial many - body wavefunctions that have various kinds of ( possibly exotic ) isospin order .",
    "the relevant isospin quantum number can be associated with landau level index , layer index , spin index , or any other good quantum numbers describing the corresponding noninteracting system . within hartree - fock approximation",
    "we investigate phases with isospin spiral and/or stripe orders and discuss their relevance for various systems . in table",
    "[ system_notation ] we summarize the definition of the isospin up(down ) components for each system individually . for the convenience of discussion",
    ", we use following notations and labels to denote the systems in the rest of this paper ( see also fig . [ level_fig ] ) : @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the intersubband and intrasubband level crossing ( or level near degeneracy in @xmath25 case ) in a wide well system with filling factor @xmath26 respectively ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are for the level crossing ( or level near degeneracy in @xmath27 case ) in a double well system at total filling factor , @xmath16 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "( note that the distinction between intrasubband and intersubband level crossing of a wide well system in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field is somewhat ambiguous and will be clarified in the next section . ) by `` level crossing ''",
    "we mean a point in the parameter space of noninteracting electrons , for which the energy difference between the highest filled landau level and the lowest empty landau level vanishes , while by `` level near degeneracy '' we mean a region in the parameter space , in which the energy difference between the above noninteracting electron levels is not zero , but relatively small compared to the interlevel interaction energy , which can strongly mix the two close noninteracting landau levels in certain situations .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following six quantum phases generated by our trial wavefunction : conventional incompressible integer qh liquid ( i.e. isospin polarized ) , isospin coherent , isospin spiral , isospin coherent stripe , isospin spiral stripe and isospin skyrmion stripe phases , classified by the behaviors of the expectation values of their isospin components , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "more precise definitions and the related physical properties of these phases will be discussed in section [ trial_wavefunction ] . in the last two columns of table [ system_notation ] we list the exotic many - body phases that become the ground states near the appropriate degeneracy points and the associated broken symmetries . for a wide well system at @xmath32 near",
    "the intersubband level crossing ( i.e. @xmath33 in small in - plane field region ) , we find that interactions stabilize the isospin coherent phase , which breaks the parity ( space inversion ) symmetry and can be understood as a quantum hall ferroelectric state @xcite .",
    "for the same system near the intrasubband level near degeneracy region ( i.e. @xmath25 in large in - plane field region ) , we obtain the isospin skyrmion stripe phase , which breaks both parity and translational symmetries of the system . for wide well systems at even filling factors we find that many - body states with isospin coherence and/or stripe order are not favored at either the intersubband ( @xmath34 ) or the intrasubband ( @xmath35 ) degenerate points within the hf approximation , exhibiting instead a trivial first order phase transition at the level crossing points .",
    "however , we find the calculated hf energy difference between the uniform ground state and the phases of spiral and stripe orders to be rather small , indicating the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry breaking in more refined approximations . therefore , based on our hf calculation results , we suggest the existence of skyrmion stripe phase , breaking both spin rotational and translational symmetries near the degenerate point of @xmath35 systems , may be responsible for the resistance anisotropy observed recently in ref .",
    "( as for the magnetoresistance anisotropy observed in si / sige semiconductor @xcite , the complication of valley degeneracy in si makes a straightforward comparison between our theory and the experiments difficult . ) for a double well system at @xmath16 ( @xmath27 ) , several interesting phases can be stabilized in the parameter range of interest ( see table [ system_notation ] ) , while only a commensurate caf phase is stabilized for even filling factor , @xmath2 ( @xmath28 ) , being consistent with the earlier results @xcite .",
    "all of our calculation are carried out at zero temperature without any disorder or impurity scattering effects .",
    "we suggest that these symmetry broken phases discussed in this paper should be observable in transport and inelastic light scattering experiments .",
    "we note that the presence of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath9 ( in the 2d plane ) automatically introduced a tilted magnetic field of amplitude @xmath36 at an angle of @xmath37 ) tilted with respect to the normal vector of the 2d plane since the field @xmath10 , perpendicular to the 2d plane , is always present in order to produce the 2d landau level system .",
    "the presence of @xmath9 ( or more generally , the tilted field ) introduces qualitatively new physics to 2d quantum hall systems by allowing a tuning parameter ( i.e. @xmath9 ) without affecting the basic landau level structure . changing @xmath9 in a continuous manner",
    "may enable the 2d system to undergo various quantum phase transition which would not otherwise be possible .",
    "thus the physics of quantum hall systems becomes considerably richer in the presence of a continuously tunable parallel ( or tilted ) magnetic field .",
    "the general ( and somewhat ambitious ) goal of our theoretical work present in this paper is to study this rich quantum phase diagram of 2d quantum hall systems as a function of the in - plane field ( used as a tunning parameter ) .",
    "as such we concentrate in the two most promising candidate systems , namely the ( single ) wide quantum well system and the ( bilayer ) double quantum well system , where the tilted field configuration is expected to give rise to exotic symmetry - broken quantum orders in the quantum hall ground states .",
    "the underlying idea is to use the in - plane magnetic field as a tuning parameter to cause level crossing ( or almost level degeneracy ) in the noninteracting system ( around the fermi level ) to see if the interaction effects then drive the system to non - trivial symmetry - broken many - body ground states ( particularly with exotic quantum order ) which can be experimentally studied .",
    "earlier examples of such exotic symmetry - broken ground states ( arising from level crossing phenomena ) include , in addition to our prediction @xcite of a skyrmion stripe phase , the bilayer canted antiferromagnetic phase predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite where a tilted field is not necessary .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ hamiltonian ] we introduce the hamiltonians of interest , for both wide well and double well systems in the presence of a finite in - plane magnetic field . in section [ trial_wavefunction ] we propose various trial many - body wavefunctions incorporating both isospin stripe and isospin spiral orders .",
    "physical features of the six typical phases generated by the wavefunctions will also be discussed in detail . for the systems of even filling factors , we propose trial wavefunctions that involve the four landau levels closest to the fermi energy simultaneously .",
    "( including four rather than two levels in many - body wavefunctions was shown to be crucial for establishing the many - body canted antiferromagnetic state in bilayer systems at @xmath12 @xcite . )",
    "we will then divide the hartree - fock variational energies and the related numerical results into the following four sections : wide well systems at @xmath32 ( section [ sec_w1 ] ) and at @xmath38 ( section [ sec_w2 ] ) ; double well systems at total filling factor @xmath16 ( section [ sec_d1 ] ) and at @xmath2 ( section [ sec_d2 ] ) . for the sake of convenience ( and relative independence of different sections ) , results of each section are discussed independently and then compared with each other in section [ discussion ] , where we also make connections to the earlier works in the literature .",
    "finally we summarize our paper in section [ summary ] , and discuss some open questions .",
    "in this section , we present the hamiltonians of the systems we will study in this paper , including both the single wide ( parabolic ) well systems and the double ( thin ) well ( or bilayer ) systems .",
    "most of the formulae given in this section exist in the literature ( perhaps scattered over many publications ) and hence we will not derive them in details unless absolutely necessary . to make the notations consistent throughout this paper",
    ", we use the superscript @xmath39 to denote physical variables or quantities for the wide well system and the superscript @xmath40 for the double well systems .",
    "we will also describe the symmetry properties of these systems , which are crucial in formulating the many - body trial wavefunctions in the next section and in discussing the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the associated exotic quantum order in our various proposed phases .      for a wide well system",
    "we consider a parabolic confinement potential @xcite in the growth direction ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is electron effective mass and @xmath44 is the confinement energy .",
    "the advantage of using a parabolic well model is that we can easily diagonalize the noninteracting hamiltonian even in the presence of in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we will use eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian as the basis functions for writing variational slater determinant states for the many - body wavefunctions that may be stablized by coulomb interactions .",
    "we believe that our wide well results obtained in this paper for parabolic confinement should be qualitatively valid even for nonparabolic quantum wells . to incorporate both the in - plane magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) , which we take to be along the @xmath45 axis in this section , and the perpendicular ( along the @xmath41 axis ) magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) in the hamiltonian , we choose two kinds of landau gauges for the vector potential : in one of them , @xmath46}(\\vec{r}\\,)=(0,b_\\bot x - b_\\| z,0)$ ] , particle momentum",

    "the final physical results are of course independent of the choice of the gauge .",

    "the specific issue we addresses is the nature of the phase transition in @xmath11 bilayer system as the layer separation ( @xmath18 ) is increased in the zero ( or weak ) tunneling situation .",
    "it is commonly believed , not however based on any really compelling evidence , that the @xmath11 bilayer system undergoes a first order transition from an incompressible interlayer - coherent quantum hall state ( presumably a halperin ( 1,1,1 ) state @xcite ) to a compressible state ( presumably two decoupled @xmath684 single - layer states ) as @xmath18 increases above a critical value ( which depends on the tunneling strength ) .",
    "we want to suggest here another distinct possibility based on our results presented in this paper .",
    "it is in principle , possible for the transition to be a second order quantum phase transition ( rather than a direct first order transition ) to a many - body state with exotic quantum order , such as an isospin stripe phase discussed in this paper",
    ". such an exotic phase will still be incompressible ( for low value of disorder ) , but perhaps with a much smaller value of the incompressibility gap .",
    "( the system will make a transition to the compressible state of two decoupled @xmath684 layers at some still larger nonuniversal value of @xmath18 . )",

    "in particular , the early calculation of fertig @xcite finding a finite wavevector magnetoplasmon mode softening in bilayer tdhf theory indicates the obvious possibility of an isospin stripe formation at the characteristic wavevector of mode softening . the second order quantum phase transition associated with this mode softening leads to an incompressible state ( at low disorder ) which has a finite quasiparticle gap ( perhaps reduced from that in the uniform ( 1,1,1 ) phase ) . at some higher value of disorder",
    "the stripes would eventually be pinned independently in each layer , leading to an incompressible - to - compressible phase transition as a function of increasing disorder .",
    "( this is also consistent with experiment where all the interesting results are typically obtained in extremely high mobility bilayer samples . )",
    "the level crossing hf technique used in our current work is unfortunately unsuitable to investigate the @xmath11 bilayer case , which has to be studied by the direct numerical diagonalization technique .",
    "it is therefore encouraging that there is recent numerical evidence @xcite in apparent support of the scenario as proposed here .",
    "the recent experimental results of inelastic light scattering @xcite , showing that the magneto - roton excitation is softened at a layer separation very close to the incompressible - to - compressible phase boundary , is also consistent with our scenario that there is an intermediate second order phase transition to a stripe phase before the system undergoes the first order transition to a compressible state .",

    "a simple scenario to understand this is to view an isospin stripe phase as a two independent ( incoherent ) stripes in the two degenerate levels , each of which is partially filled , and therefore the stripe longitudinal direction must be aligned to be perpendicular to the in - plane field direction to optimize the anisotropy energy in each level , similar to the stripes at half filling factors extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",

    "<S> we use the microscopic hartree - fock approximation to investigate various quantum phase transitions associated with possible spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by a tilted magnetic field in the integral quantum hall regime of wide parabolic wells and zero width double well ( bilayer ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> spin , isospin ( associated with the layer index in the bilayer systems ) , and orbital dynamics all play important roles in the quantum phase transitions being studied . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a general class of variational wavefunctions that describe several types of parity , spin , and translational symmetry breaking , including spin and charge density wave phases . in wide well systems at odd filling factors </S>",
    "<S> , we find a many - body state of broken parity symmetry for weak in - plane magnetic fields and an isospin skyrmion stripe phase , which simultaneously has isospin and charge modulation , for strong in - plane fields . in wide well systems at even filling factors , we find direct first order transitions between simple ( un)polarized qh states with several complex many - body states that are only slightly higher in energy ( within the hartree - fock theory ) than the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that going beyond the approximations used in this paper one may be able to stabilize such many - body phases with broken symmetries ( most likely the skyrmion stripe phase ) . in a bilayer system at the filling factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an integer </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an isospin spiral stripe phase in addition to the known ( in)commensurate phases and the stripe phase without isospin winding . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a charge or spin density wave instability in the bilayer system at @xmath2 , except for the known commensurate canted antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> zero temperature quantum phase diagrams for these systems are calculated in the parameter regime of experimental interest . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the symmetry properties of our predicted quantum phase diagrams and give a unified picture of these novel many - body phases . </S>",
    "<S> we point out how quantum level crossing phenomena in many situations ( tuned by the applied tilted magnetic field ) may lead to interesting quantum phases and transitions among them . </S>",
    "<S> a conceptually new aspect of our theory is the predicted possibility for the spontaneous breaking of parity symmetry , which indicates a `` ferroelectric '' quantum order in integer quantum hall systems and has not been considered in the literature before . </S>"
