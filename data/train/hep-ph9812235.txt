    "the previous field - theoretical discussion of the higgs mechanism can be rephrased in more physical language .",
    "it is well known that a massless vector boson such as the photon @xmath19 or gluon @xmath21 has just two polarization states : @xmath30 .",
    "however , a massive vector boson such as the @xmath31 has three polarization states : @xmath32 .",

    ", this should have non - zero electroweak isospin @xmath34 , and the simplest possibility is a complex isodoublet @xmath35 , as assumed above .",
    "this has four degrees of freedom , three of which are eaten by the @xmath15 amd @xmath36 as their third polarization states , leaving us with one physical higgs boson @xmath37 .",
    "once the vacuum expectation value @xmath38 is fixed , the mass of the remaining physical higgs boson is given by m^2_h = 2 ^ 2 = 4 v^2 [ onefifteen ] which is a free parameter in the .",
    "the necessity for such a physical higgs boson may be further demonstrated by considering the scattering amplitude for @xmath39  @xcite . by unitarity",
    "this contributes to elastic @xmath40 scttering at the one - loop level .",
    "this contribution would be divergent and unrenormalizable in the absence of a direct - channel spin-0 contribution to cancel mass - dependent contributions from the established @xmath41 and @xmath36 exchanges .",
    "if these spin-0 contributions to @xmath42 and analogously @xmath43 are due to a single higgs boson , as in the , its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons are completely determined : g_h|ff = g 2 m_f m_w  ,   g_hw^+w^- = g m_w  ,  g_hz^0z^0 = g m_z [ onesixteen ] thus the higgs production and decay rates are completely fixed as functions of the unknown mass @xmath44 ( [ onefifteen ] )  @xcite .",
    "this unitarity argument actually requires that @xmath45 1 tev in order to accomplish its one - loop cancellation mission  @xcite .",
    "the search for the higgs boson is one of the main objectives of the lep  2 experimental programme .",
    "the dominant production mechanism is @xmath46  @xcite , which has the tree - level cross section  @xcite _ zm = g^2_f m^4_z96s  ( 1+(1 - 4 ^ 2_w)^2 )  ^1/2   + 12 m^2_z / s(1-m^2_z / s)^2 [ oneseventeen ] the prefactor comes from the known @xmath47 vertex ( [ onesixteen ] ) , and the phase - space factor ( 1-(m^2_hs ) - ( m^2_zs))^2 - 4m^2_h m^2_zs^2 [ oneeighteen ] which gives us sensitivity to @xmath48 . with the current lep  2 running at 189 gev , each individual lep experiment has established a lower limit @xmath49 96 gev , and the four experiments could probably be combined to yield @xmath49 98 gev  @xcite .",
    "the next two years of lep  2 running at energies @xmath50 gev should enable the higgs to be discovered if @xmath51 110 gev , if as much luminosity is accumulated as in 1998 . as we see shortly , this covers the range of @xmath52 where the precision electroweak data  @xcite indicate the highest probability density .",
    "hence , the integrated probability that lep  2 discovers the higgs boson is not negligible , though we must brace ourselves for the likelihood that it is too heavy to be discovered at lep .",
    "the precision of the electroweak data shown in figure 1 is so high  of order 0.1 % in some cases  that quantum corrections are crucial for their interpretation  @xcite . at the one - loop level , these include vacuum - polarization , vector and box diagrams . the dominant contributions from two- and higher - loop diagrams must also be taken into account .",
    "these loop diagrams must be renormalized , and this is achieved by fixing three quantities at their physical values : @xmath53 gev , @xmath54 , @xmath55 gev@xmath56 . in the case of experiments at the @xmath36 peak , one needs to calculate the renormalization of @xmath57 over scales @xmath58 due to vacuum polarization diagrams .",
    "the principal uncertainty in this renormalization is due to hadronic diagrams in the range of @xmath59 where perturbative qcd calculations are not directly applicable .",
    "the renormalized value used by the lep electroweak working group is ^-1_em ( m_z ) = 128.878 0.090 [ onenineteen ] however , this may be refined to @xmath60 by more complete use of constraints from perturbative qcd and data on @xmath61 decays  @xcite . beyond the tree level , the parameter @xmath29 may be defined in several different ways .",
    "one option is the  on - shell \" definition @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "the lep experiments often use another physical definition more closely related to their experimental observables , as in fig . 2 , but theorists often favour the @xmath63 definition  @xcite , which is more convenient for comparison with qcd and gut calculations .",
    "consistency between the different measurements shown in fig . 1 ",
    "e.g. , the @xmath29 measurements shown displayed in fig .",
    "2  imposes constraints on the masses of heavy virtual particles that appear in loop diagrams , such as the top quark and the higgs boson  @xcite . as examples of this , consider their contributions to @xmath64 and @xmath25 in the  on - shell \" renormalization scheme : m^2_w ^2_w = m^2_z ^2_w^2_w = g _  ( 1+r ) [ onetwenty ] in the absence of the top quark , the gauge symmetry of the   would be lost , since the @xmath65 quark would occupy an incomplete doublet of weak isospin , destroying the renormalizability of the theory at the one - loop level .",
    "this is reflected in the contributions of the one - loop vacuum - polarization diagrams  @xcite : r  m^2_t +  [ onetwentyone ] in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "likewise , the   would be non - renormalizable in the absence of a physical higgs boson , so @xmath67 must also blow up as @xmath68 . as pointed out by veltman",
    "@xcite , a screening theorem restricts this to a logarithmic dependence at the one - loop level r  m^2_w  \\{43 +  } [ onetwentytwo ] for @xmath69 , though there is a quadratic dependence at the two - loop level .    comparing ( [ onetwentyone ] ) and",

    "however , this motivation did not provide a clear clue as to the mass scale of supersymmetry breaking , so there was no obvious reason why the sparticle masses should not be as heavy as @xmath150 gev .    such a reason was eventually provided by the mass hierarchy problem  @xcite : why is @xmath151 ?",

    "gauge interactions then mediate the supersymmetry breaking needed in the observable sector .",

    "they have recently been reincarnated  @xcite with the idea that supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector might originate from non - perturbative phenomena , which are much better understood by now  @xcite .",
    "there have been two principal motivations for this reincarnation .",
    "one is that gauge mediation naturally imposes flavour universality in the observable sector  @xcite .",
    "all quarks ( or leptons ) with the same charge acquire universal soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses , avoiding any problems with flavour - changing neutral interactions  @xcite and reducing the effective number of parameters in the observable sector .",
    "a feature of gauge - mediated models is the appearance of a massless goldstone fermion @xmath463 , which would acquire a small mass when gravity is taken into account , as discussed in the next section .",
    "this implies that the lightest neutralino @xmath302 is unstable : @xmath531 decay dominates .",
    "this provides the second motivation for gauge - mediated models , which is the report by the cdf collaboration  @xcite of an apparent @xmath532 missing @xmath533 event .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that this might be due to @xmath534 pair production followed by @xmath535 decays , or due to @xmath536 pair production followed by @xmath537 decays .",
    "however , no other @xmath538 missing @xmath533 events have been observed either at lep  @xcite or at the fnal tevatron collider  @xcite , and most of the parameter spaces for these interpretations have now been excluded , as seen in fig .",
    "33  @xcite . clearly , further experimental input from future collider runs is needed .",
    "some final comments on gauge - mediated models are in order .",
    "the first is that it has proved to be quite difficult to construct a model that is consistent with all the phenomenological constraints , has a desirable stable vacuum , etc . .",
    "the other is that , to the extent that the hidden scale @xmath541 , the apparent vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) @xmath542 , worsening the discrepancy with the astrophysical upper limit ( or observation ) ( [ fivenine ] ) .",
    "however , in order to discuss this issue seriously , one needs a supersymmetric quantum theory of gravity , to which we now turn .",
    "why make a local theory of supersymmetry ?",
    "one motivation is the analogy with gauge theories , in which bosonic symmetries are made local .",
    "another is that local supersymmetry necessarily involves the introduction of gravity . since both gravity and ( surely ! ) supersymmetry exist , this seems an inevitable step .",
    "it also leads to the possibility of unifying all the particle interactions including gravity , which was one of our original motivations for supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , in the context of this lecture , it is interesting that local supersymmetry ( supergravity ) admits an elegant mechanism for supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , analogous to the higgs mechanism in gauge theories , which allows us to address more seriously the possible existence of a cosmological constant .    the basic building block in a supergravity theory  @xcite is the graviton supermultiplet of ( [ twoforteen ] ) , which contains particles with helicities @xmath543 , the latter being the gravitino of spin @xmath544 .",
    "why is this required when one makes supersymmetry local ?",

    "_ = ^m _ _ mn ^ _ [ fivetwentytwo ] where @xmath554 is the vierbein and @xmath555 the minkowski metric tensor , and @xmath556 is a covariant derivative _ + ^mn _ [ _ m , _ n ] [ fivetwentythree ] where @xmath557 is the spin connection .",
    "this is the simplest possible generally - covariant model of a spin-3/2 field .",
    "it is remarkable that it is invariant under the local supersymmetry transformations : ^m _ & = & | ( x ) ^m _ ( x ) , + _ ^mn & = & 0 , _ = d _ ( x ) [ fivetwentyfour ] just as the simplest possible @xmath558 theory ( [ twosixteen ] ) was globally supersymmetric , and also the action of an adjoint spin-1/2 field in a gauge theory .    it is also remarkable that supergravity admits an elegant analogue of the higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite . just as one combines the two polarization states of a massless gauge field with the single state of a massless goldstone boson to obtain the three polarization states of a massive gauge boson",
    ", one may combine the two polarization states of a massless gravitino @xmath559 with the two polarization states of a massless goldstone fermion @xmath463 to obtain the four polarization states of a massive spin-3/2 particle @xmath560 .",
    "this super - higgs mechanism corresponds to a spontaneous breakdown of local supersymmetry , since the massless graviton @xmath561 has a different mass from the gravitino @xmath560 : m_g = 0 = m_. [ fivetwentyfive ] this is the only known consistent way of breaking local symmetry , just as the higgs mechanism is the only way to generate @xmath562 .",
    "moreover , this can be achieved while keeping zero vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) , at least at the tree level .",
    "the reason for this is the appearance in local supersymmetry ( supergravity ) of a third term in the effective potential ( [ fivefive ] ) , which has a _ negative _ sign  @xcite .",
    "there is no time in these lectures to discuss this exciting feature in detail : the interested reader is referred to the original literature and the simplest example  @xcite . in this latter case , @xmath563 for _ any _ value of the gravitino mass , for which reason",
    "it was named no - scale supergravity  @xcite .",
    "again , there is no time to discuss here details of the coupling of supergravity to matter  @xcite .",
    "however , it is useful to have in mind the general features of the theory in the limit where @xmath564 , but the gravitino mass @xmath565 remains fixed .",
    "one generally has non - zero gaugino masses @xmath566 , and their universality is quite generic .",
    "one also has non - zero scalar masses @xmath567 , but their universality is much more problematic , and even violated in generic string models .",
    "it was this failing that partly refuelled the renewed interest in the gauge - mediated models mentioned in the previous section .",
    "a generic supergravity theory also yields non - universal trilinear soft supersymmetry - breaking couplings @xmath568 and bilinear scalar couplings @xmath569 .",
    "therefore , supergravity may generate the full menagerie of soft supersymmetry - breaking terms : - _ a m_1/2_a _ a _ a - _ i m^2_0_i    generated at the supergravity scale near @xmath570 gev , the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters are renormalized as discussed in lecture 2 .",
    "the analogous parameters in gauge - mediated models would also be renormalized , but to a different extent , because the mediation scale @xmath571 .",
    "this difference may provide a signature of such models , as discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "also renormalized is the vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) , which is a potential embarassment .",
    "loop corrections in a non - supersymmetric theory are quartically divergent , whereas those in a generic supergravity theory are only quadratically divergent , suggesting a contribution to the cosmological constant of order @xmath572 , perhaps @xmath573",
    "! particular models may have a one - loop quantum correction of order @xmath574 , but more magic ( a new symmetry ? ) is needed to suppress the cosmological constant to the required level ( [ fivenine ] ) .",
    "this is one of the motivations for tackling string theory , which is our only candidate for a fundamental theory of everything including gravity .",
    "the greatest piece of unfinished business for twentieth - century physics is to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics .",
    "there are aspects of this problem , one being that of the cosmological constant , as discussed above .",
    "another is that of perturbative quantum - gravity effects .",
    "tree - level graviton exchange in @xmath575 scattering , such as @xmath576 at lep , has an amplitude @xmath577 , and hence a cross section _",
    "g ~e^2/m^4_p [ fivetwentyseven ] this is very small ( negligible ! ) at lep energies , reaching the unitarity limit only when @xmath578 .",
    "however , when one calculates loop amplitudes involving gravitons , the rapid growth with energy ( [ fivetwentyseven ] ) leads to uncontrollable , non - renormalizable divergences .",
    "these are of power type , and diverge faster and faster in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "there are also non - perturbative problems in the quantization of gravity , that first arose in connection with black holes . from the pioneering work of bekenstein and hawking  @xcite on black - hole thermodynamics , we know that",
    "black holes have non - zero entropy @xmath139 and temperature @xmath140 , related to the schwarzschild horizon radius .",
    "this means that the quantum description of a black hole should involve mixed states .",
    "the intuition underlying this feature is that information can be lost through the event horizon .",
    "consider , for example , a pure quantum - mechanical pair state @xmath579 prepared near the horizon , and what happens if one of the particles , say @xmath256 , falls through the horizon while @xmath222 escapes , as seen in fig .",
    "34 . in this case , _",
    "i c_i        the problem is that conventional quantum mechanics does not permit the evolution of a pure initial state into a mixed final state .",
    "this is an issue both for the quantum particles discussed above and for the black hole itself .",
    "we could imagine having prepared the black hole by fusing massive or energetic particles in a pure initial state , e.g. , by splitting a laser beam and then firing the sub - beams at each other as in a laser device for inertial nuclear fusion .",
    "these problems point to a fundamental conflict between the proudest achievements of early twentieth - century physics , quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "one or the other should be modified , and perhaps both . since quantum mechanics",
    "is sacred to field theorists , most particle physicists prefer to modify general relativity by elevating it to string theory  @xcite .      at the level of perturbation theory , the divergence difficulties of quantum gravity can be related to the absence in a point - particle theory of a cutoff at short distances : for example , ^ d^4k ( ) _ 1/ 0 d^4x ( ) ~^2 [ fivetwentynine ] such divergences can be alleviated or removed if one replaces point particles by extended objects .",
    "the simplest possibility is to extend in just one dimension , leading us to a theory of strings .",
    "in such a theory , instead of point particles describing one - dimensional world lines , we have strings describing two - dimensional world sheets .",
    "most popular have been closed loops of string , whose simplest world sheet is a tube .",
    "the  wiring diagrams \" generated by the feynman rules of conventional point - like particle theories become the  plumbing circuits \" generated by the junctions and connections of these tubes of closed string .",
    "one could imagine generalizing this idea to higher - dimensional extended objects such as membranes describing world volumes , etc . , and we return later to this option .    on a historical note ,",
    "string models first arose from old - fashioned strong - interaction theory , before the advent of qcd .",
    "the lowest - lying hadronic states were joined by a very large number of excited states with increasing masses @xmath582 and spins @xmath174 : j = ^m^2 where @xmath583 was called the  regge slope \" .",
    "one interpretation of this spectrum was of @xmath584 bound states in a linearly - rising potential , like an elastic string holding the constituents together , with tension @xmath585 .",
    "it was pointed out that such an infinitely ( ? ) large set of resonances in the direct @xmath586-channel of a scattering process could be dual ( equivalent ) to the exchange of a similar infinite set in the crossed channel .",
    "mathematically , this idea was expressed by the veneziano  @xcite amplitude for @xmath575 scattering , and its generalizations to @xmath587 particle production processes .",
    "then it was pointed out that these amplitudes could be derived formally from an underlying quantum theory of string  @xcite . however , this first incarnation of string theory was not able to accommodate the point - like partons seen inside hadrons at this time - the converse of the quantum - gravity motivation for string theory mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "then along came qcd , which incorporated these point - like scaling properties and provided a qualitative understanding of confinement , which has now become quantitative with the advent of modern lattice calculations .",
    "thus string theory languished as a candidate model of the strong interactions .",
    "it was realized early on that unitarity required the existence of closed strings , even in an _ a priori _ open - string theory .",
    "moreover , it was observed that the spectrum of a closed string included a massless spin-2 particle , which was an embarrassment for a theory of the strong interactions . however , this led to the idea  @xcite of reinterpreting string theory as a theory of everything , with this massless spin-2 state interpreted as the graviton and the string tension elevated to @xmath588 .",
    "as already mentioned , one of the primary reasons for studying extended objects in connection with quantum gravity is the softening of divergences associated with short - distance behaviour . since the string propagates on a world sheet , the basic formalism is two - dimensional .",
    "accordingly , string vibrations may be described in terms of left- and right - moving waves : ( r , t ) _ l ( r - t ) , _ r ( r+t ) [ fivethirty ] if the string has no boundary , as for a closed string , the left- and right - movers are independent . when quantized , they may be described by a two - dimensional field theory .",
    "compared to a four - dimensional theory , it is relatively easy to make a two - dimensional field theroy finite . in this case , it has conformal symmetry , which has an infinite - dimensional symmetry group in two dimensions .",
    "however , as you already know from gauge theories , one must be careful to ensure that this classical symmetry is not broken at the quantum level by anomalies . if the quantum string theory is to be consistent in a flat background space - time , the conformal anomaly fixes the number of left- and right - movers each to be equivalent to 26 free bosons if the theory has no supersymmetry , or 10 boson / fermion supermultiplets if the theory has @xmath191 supersymmetry on the world sheet .",
    "there are other important quantum consistency conditions , and it was the demonstration by green and schwarz  @xcite that certain string theories are completely anomaly - free that opened the floodgates of theoretical interest in string theory as a theory of everything  @xcite .    among consistent string theories ,",
    "one may enumerate the following .",
    "bosonic string _ exists in 26 dimensions , but this is not even its worst problem ! it contains no fermionic matter degrees of freedom , and the flat - space vacuum is intrinsically unstable . _ superstrings _ exist in 10 dimensions , have fermionic matter and also a stable flat - space vacuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the ten - dimensional theory is left - right symmetric , and the incorporation of parity violation in four dimensions is not trivial .",
    "heterotic string _",
    "@xcite was originally formulated in 10 dimensions , with parity violation already incorporated , since the left- and right movers were treated differently .",
    "this theory also has a stable vacuum , but suffers from the disadvantage of having too many dimensions . _",
    "four - dimensional heterotic strings _ may be obtained either by compactifying the six surplus dimensions : @xmath589 compact dimensions with size @xmath590  @xcite , or by direct construction in four dimensions , replacing the missing dimensions by other internal degrees of freedom such as fermions  @xcite or group manifolds or ... ? in this way it was possible to incorporate a gut - like gauge group  @xcite or even something resembling the standard model  @xcite .",
    "what are the general features of such string models ?",
    "they predict there are no more than 10 dimensions , which agrees with the observed number of 4 !",
    "secondly , they suggest that the rank of the four - dimensional gauge group should not be very large , in agreement with the rank 4 of the standard model !",
    "thirdly , the simplest four - dimensional string models do not accommodate large matter representations  @xcite , such as an of su(3 ) or a of su(2 ) , again in agreement with the known representation structure of the standard model !",
    "fourthly , simple string models predict fairly successfully the mass of the top quark .",
    "this is because the maximum generic value of a yukawa coupling @xmath591 is of the same order as the gauge coupling @xmath21 .",
    "applied to the top quark , this suggests that m_t = _ t < 0 |h|0",
    "> = o(g ) 250 [ fivethirtyone ] moreover , the renormalization - group equation for @xmath591 exhibits an approximate infra - red fixed point , as seen in fig .",
    "this means that a large range of yukawa coupling inputs at the planck scale yield very similar physical values of @xmath72 190 gev .",
    "fifthly , string theory makes a fairly successful prediction for the gauge unification scale in terms of @xmath159 .",
    "if the intrinsic string coupling @xmath592 is weak , one predicts  @xcite      m_gut = o(g ) 10 ^ 17 [ fivethirtytwo ] where @xmath21 is the gauge coupling , which is @xmath593 higher than the value calculated from the bottom up in lecture 4 on the basis of lep measurement of the gauge couplings . on the one hand , it is impressive that the bottom - up extrapolation over 14 decades agrees to within 10 % ( on a logarithmic scale ) with the top - down calculation ( [ fivethirtyone ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it would be nice to obtain closer agreement , and this provides the major motivation for considering strongly - coupled string theory , which corresponds to a large internal dimension @xmath594 , as we discuss next .",
    "current developments involve going beyond string to consider higher - dimensional extended objects , such as generalized membranes with various numbers of internal dimensions .",
    "these may be obtained as solitons ( non - perturbative classical solutions ) of string theory , with masses m [ fivethirtythree ] analogously to monopoles in gauge theory .",
    "it is evident from ( [ fivethirtythree ] ) that such membrane - solitons become light in the limit of strong string coupling @xmath595 .",
    "it was observed some time ago that there should be a strong - coupling / weak - coupling duality  @xcite between elementary excitations and monopoles in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "these ideas have recently been confirmed in a spectacular solution of @xmath194 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has recently been shown that there are analogous dualities in string theory , whereby solitons in some strongly - coupled string theory are equivalent to light string states in some other weakly - coupled string theory .",
    "indeed , it appears that all string theories are related by such dualities .",
    "a particularity of this discovery is that the string coupling strength @xmath592 is related to an extra dimension , in such a way that its size @xmath596 as @xmath595 .",
    "this then leads to the idea of an underlying 11-dimensional framework called @xmath0 theory  @xcite that reduces to the different string theories in different strong / weak - coupling linits , and reduces to eleven - dimensional supergravity in the low - energy limit .",
    "a particular class of string solitons called @xmath212-branes  @xcite offers a promising approach to the black hole information paradox mentioned previously . according to this picture ,",
    "black holes are viewed as solitonic balls of string , and their entropy simply counts the number of internal string states  @xcite .",
    "these are in principle countable , so string theory may provide an accounting system for the information contained in black holes . within this framework ,",
    "the previously paradoxical process ( [ fivetwentyeight ] ) becomes |a , b > + |bh > |b^ > + |bh^ > [ fivethirtyfour ] and the final state is pure if the initial state was .",
    "the apparent entropy of the final state in ( [ fivetwentyeight ] ) is now interpreted as entanglement .",
    "the  lost \" information is in principle encoded in the black - hole state , and this information could be extracted if we measured all properties of this ball of string .    in practice",
    ", we do not know how to recover this information from macroscopic black holes , so they appear to us as mixed states . what about microscopic black holes , namely fluctuations in the space - time background with @xmath597 , that last for a period @xmath598 and have a size @xmath599 ? do these steal information from us  @xcite , or do they give it back to us when they decay ?",
    "most people think there is no microscopic leakage of information in this way , but not all of us  @xcite are convinced .",
    "the neutral kaon system is among the most sensitive experimental areas  @xcite for testing this speculative possibility .",
    "a final experimental comment concerns the magnitude of the extra dimension in @xmath0 theory : lep data suggest that it may be relatively large , with size @xmath600  @xcite .",
    "remember that the nave string unification scale ( [ fivethirtytwo ] ) is about 20 times larger than @xmath397 .",
    "this may be traced to the fact that the gravitational interaction strength , although growing rapidly as a power of energy ( [ fivetwentyseven ] ) , is still much smaller than the gauge coupling strength at @xmath601 . however",
    ", if an extra space - time dimension appears at an energy @xmath602 , the gravitational interaction strength grows fast , as indicated in fig .",
    "unification with gravity around @xmath603 then becomes possible , _ if _ the gauge couplings do not also acquire a similar higher - dimensional kick .",
    "thus we are led to the startling capacitor - plate framework for fundamental physics shown in fig .",
    "the eleventh dimension has a size @xmath605 , whereas dimensions @xmath606 are compactified on a small manifold @xmath607 with characteristic size @xmath608 .",
    "the remaining four dimensions form ( approximately ) a flat minkowski space @xmath609.,height=192 ]    each plate is _ a priori _ ten - dimensional , and the bulk space between then is _ a priori _ eleven - dimensional .",
    "six dimensions are compactified on a scale @xmath610 , leaving a theory which is effectively five - dimensional in the bulk and four - dimensional on the walls . conventional gauge interactions and observable matter particles",
    "are hypothesized to live on one capacitor plate , and there are other hidden gauge interactions and matter particles living on the other plate .",
    "the fifth dimension has a characteristic size which is estimated to be @xmath611 , and physics at large distances ( smaller energies ) looks effectively four - dimensional .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is expected to originate on the hidden capacitor plate in this scenario , and to be transmitted to the observable wall by gravitational strength interactions in the bulk  @xcite .    the phenomenological richness of this speculative @xmath0-theory approach is only beginning to be explored , and it remains to be seen whether it offers a realistic phenomenological description .",
    "however , it does embody all the available theoretical wisdom as well as offering the prospect of unifying all the observable gauge interactions with gravity at a single effective scale @xmath612 .",
    "as such , it constitutes our best contemporary guess about the theory of everything within and beyond the standard model .",
