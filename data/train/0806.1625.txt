    "one of the central problems in statistical decision theory is the discrimination between two different probability distributions , intended as potential candidates for describing the values of a stochastic variable . in general , this statistical discrimination is affected by a minimal error probability @xmath0 , which decreases with the number @xmath1 of ( independent ) observations of the random variable .",
    "the general problem of determining @xmath2 was faced by h. chernoff in 1952 @xcite . remarkably , he derived an upper bound , today known as chernoff bound , having the non trivial property of providing @xmath2 in the limit of infinite observations ( i.e. , for @xmath3 ) . very recently , a quantum version of this bound has been considered in refs .",

    "the problem of quantum state discrimination is fundamental in several areas of quantum information ( e.g. , quantum cryptography @xcite ) and , in particular , for continuous variable quantum information @xcite .",
    "continuous variable ( cv ) systems are quantum systems with infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces like , for instance , the bosonic modes of a radiation field .",

    "qcbound2 , where a formula for the quantum chernoff bound has already been derived . in our paper , we recast this formula by making explicit its dependence on the symplectic spectra of the involved gaussian states .",
    "the computational difficulty of this formula relies on the fact that , besides the symplectic spectra ( easy to compute ) , one must also calculate the symplectic transformations that diagonalize the corresponding correlation matrices .",
    "the derivation of these symplectic transformations can be in fact very hard , especially when many bosonic modes are involved in the process . in order to simplify this computational problem , here we resort to standard algebraic inequalities , i.e. , the minkowski inequality and the young s inequality .",
    "thanks to these inequalities , we can manipulate the formula of the quantum chernoff bound and derive much simpler upper bounds for the discrimination of gaussian states . these bounds , that we call _",
    "minkowski bound _ and _ young bound _ , are much easier to compute since they depend on the symplectic spectra only .",
    "notice that , because of this simplification , these bounds are inevitably weaker than the quantum chernoff bound .",
    "in particular , they are useful when the gaussian states are _ unitarily inequivalent _ , i.e. , not connected by any unitary transformation ( e.g. , displacement , rotation or squeezing ) . on the one hand , this is surely a restriction for the general application of our results . on the other hand ,",
