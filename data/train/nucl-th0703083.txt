    "nuclei away from the valley of stability have opened a new paradigm in nuclear physics .",
    "they are often extremely unstable ( especially those closer to the driplines ) and have structure and properties which are quite often different from stable isotopes .",
    "many of them exhibit a halo structure in their ground states in which loosely bound valence nucleon(s ) has ( have ) a large spatial extension with respect to the respective core @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts , within a fully microscopic approach , to understand the stability of these weakly bound systems .",
    "a few of them , like different continuum shell model approaches @xcite , including the shell model embedded in the continuum @xcite , are formulated in the hilbert space , i.e. , they are based on the completeness of a single particle basis consisting of bound orbits and a real continuum . a different approach to the treatment of particle continuum",
    "is proposed in the gamow shell model @xcite , which is the multi - configurational shell model with a single particle basis given by the berggren ensemble @xcite consisting of gamow ( or resonant ) states and the complex non - resonant continuum of scattering states .",
    "a microscopic cluster study of neutron rich carbon isotopes has also been performed with the generator coordinate method in ref .",
    "however , a lot more needs to be done before one gets a more complete theoretical understanding of the underlying processes .",
    "another , widely used , method in unraveling the structure and properties of halo nuclei , is to use breakup reactions featuring the exotic projectile . for reviews of this ever burgeoning field from an experimental and theoretical perspective one",
    "is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "it is now abundantly clear that pure coulomb @xcite or pure nuclear @xcite breakup calculations may not be fully sufficient to describe all the details of the halo breakup data which have been increasing rapidly both in quality and quantity @xcite . in majority of them both coulomb and nuclear breakup effects as well as",
    "their interference terms are likely to be significant and the neglect of the latter terms may not be justified @xcite .",
    "the importance of nuclear effects even in the breakup of @xmath3b in collisions with heavy ions has been discussed in ref .",
    "thus , an important requirement in interpreting the data obtained from the experiments done already or are planned to be done in future is to have a theory which can take care of the coulomb and nuclear breakup effects as well as their interference terms on an equal footing .    for breakup reactions of light stable nuclei ,",
    "such a theory has been developed @xcite within the framework of post - form distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , which successfully describes the corresponding data at low beam energies .",
    "however , since it uses the simplifying approximation of a zero - range interaction @xcite between constituents of the projectile , it is inapplicable to cases where the internal orbital angular momentum of the projectile is different from zero .",
    "recently , we have presented a theory @xcite to describe the breakup reactions of one - nucleon halo nuclei within the post - form dwba ( pfdwba ) framework , that consistently includes both coulomb and nuclear interactions between the projectile fragments and the targets to all orders , but treats the fragment - fragment interaction in first order .",
    "the coulomb and nuclear breakups along with their interference term are treated within a single setup in this theory .",
    "the breakup contributions from the entire continuum corresponding to all the multipoles and the relative orbital angular momenta between the valence nucleon and the core fragment are included in this theory where finite range effects are treated by a local momentum approximation ( lma ) @xcite .",
    "full ground state wave function of the projectile , of any angular momentum structure , enters as an input to this theory .",
    "the coulomb - nuclear interference ( cni ) terms have also been calculated using the prior - form dwba @xcite and within models @xcite where the time evolution of the projectile in coordinate space is described by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation , treating the projectile - target ( both coulomb and nuclear ) interaction as a time dependent external perturbation .",
    "recently , the dynamical eikonal method , which unifies the semiclassical time dependent and eikonal method and also takes into account interference effects has been used to calculate realistic differential cross sections @xcite .",
    "coulomb and nuclear processes have also been treated consistently on the same footing , in the continuum discretized coupled - channels method @xcite and also within an eikonal - like framework , in refs .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , the question of beam energy dependence of cni has not been studied within breakup models before .",
    "thus there is a need to address this question and investigate this new physics aspect within existing breakup theories itself , in view of several sophisticated experiments planned in the future .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the beam energy dependence of the coulomb - nuclear interference terms in the breakup of @xmath0be on a medium mass @xmath1ti target and also calculate the relative energy spectra and one - neutron removal cross sections in the breakup of @xmath0be on a heavy @xmath2pb target at 69 mev / nucleon for two different angular ranges of the projectile center of the mass ( c.m . )",

    "we consider the elastic breakup reaction , @xmath4 , in which the projectile @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) breaks up into fragments @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( both of which can be charged ) in the coulomb and nuclear fields of a target @xmath9 .",
    "the triple differential cross section for this reaction is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the relative velocity of the projectile with respect to the target , @xmath12 is the orbital angular momentum for the relative motion of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the ground state of @xmath5 , and @xmath13 is the appropriate phase space factor ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "( [ eq2_5 ] ) , functions @xmath17 represent the distorted waves for the relative motions of various particles in their respective channels with appropriate boundary conditions .",

    ". arguments of these functions contain the corresponding jacobi momenta and coordinates .",
    "@xmath20 represents the interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath21 is the radial part of the corresponding wave function in the ground state of @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the reduced amplitude , @xmath14 [ eq . ( [ eq2_5 ] ) ] , involves a six - dimensional integral which makes its evaluation quite complicated .",
    "the problem gets further aggravated due to the fact that the integrand involves the product of three scattering waves that exhibit an oscillatory behavior asymptotically . in order to facilitate an easier computation of eq .",
    "( [ eq2_5 ] ) , we perform a taylor series expansion of the distorted waves of particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 about @xmath25 and write @xmath26 employing the lma @xcite , the magnitudes of momenta @xmath27 are taken as @xmath28 } , \\label{ea6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the reduced mass of the @xmath31 system , @xmath32 is the energy of particle @xmath33 relative to the target in the center of mass ( c.m . ) system , and @xmath34 is the potential between @xmath33 and @xmath9 at a distance @xmath35 .",
    "finally , one obtains @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq18_5 ] ) , @xmath39 @xmath40 are the radial part of the partial wave @xmath41 expansion of distorted wave @xmath42 , and is calculated by solving the schrdinger equation with proper optical potentials which includes both coulomb and nuclear terms .",
    "generally , the maximum value of the partial waves @xmath43 must be very large in order to ensure the convergence of the partial wave summations in eq .",
    "( [ eq17_5 ] ) .",
    "however , for the case of one - neutron halo nuclei , one can make use of the following method to include summations over infinite number of partial waves .",
    "we write @xmath14 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined in the same way as eq .",
    "( [ eq17_5 ] ) except for the summation sign and @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . if the value of @xmath50 is chosen to be appropriately large , the contribution of the nuclear field to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq19_5 ] ) can be neglected and we can write @xmath51 where the first term on the right hand side , is the pure coulomb breakup amplitude which for the case where one of the outgoing fragments is uncharged , can be expressed analytically in terms of the bremsstrahlung integral ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "only two terms , with reasonable upper limits , are required to be evaluated by the partial wave expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq19_5 ] ) .",
    "the wave function , @xmath52 , appearing in the structure term , @xmath53 [ eq .  ( [ eqst ] ) ] , has been calculated by adopting a single particle potential model in the same way as in ref .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0be was considered to be a predominantly @xmath54-state with a @xmath55 valence neutron coupled to the @xmath56 @xmath57be core [ @xmath57be @xmath58 @xmath59 with a one - neutron separation energy of 504 kev and a spectroscopic factor of 0.74 @xcite .",
    "the single particle wave function was constructed by assuming the valence neutron-@xmath57be interaction to be of woods - saxon type whose depth was adjusted to reproduce the corresponding value of the binding energy with fixed values of the radius and diffuseness parameters ( taken to be 1.236 fm and 0.62 fm , respectively ) .",
    "this gave a potential depth of 59.08 mev , a root mean square ( rms ) radius for the valence neutron of 7.07 fm , and a rms radius for @xmath0be of 2.98 fm when the size of the @xmath57be core was taken to be 2.28 fm .",
    "the neutron - target optical potentials used by us were extracted from the global set of bechhetti - greenlees ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) , while those used for the @xmath57be - target ( @xcite ) system are shown in table i. following  @xcite , we have used the sum of these two potentials for the @xmath0be - target channel .",
    "we found that values of @xmath50 of 500 and 400 for pb and ti targets , respectively , provided very good convergence of the corresponding partial wave expansion series [ eq .",
    "( [ eq17_5 ] ) ] .",
    "the local momentum wave vectors are evaluated at a distance , @xmath35 = 10 fm in all the cases , and their directions are taken to be same as that of asymptotic momenta .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table ii , we show the contributions of pure coulomb and pure nuclear breakup mechanisms to the total one - neutron removal cross sections in the breakup of @xmath0be on @xmath2pb for two different angular ranges of @xmath61 , at the beam energy of 69 mev / nucleon .",
    "the incoherent sum shown in the penultimate column of the table is obtained by simply adding the pure coulomb and pure nuclear cross sections .    for the breakup of @xmath0be on pb in the @xmath61range of @xmath62@xmath63 ,",
    "coulomb breakup accounts for most ( @xmath64 78% ) of the total cross section , while in the angular range of @xmath62@xmath65 ( well below the grazing angle ) it accounts for almost all of the total cross section .",
    "the total one - neutron removal cross section on pb does not seem to be affected by the cni terms .",
    "this is because the cni terms manifest themselves explicitly in more exclusive measurements , like double differential cross sections than in quantities like total cross sections .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the beam energy dependence of the coulomb - nuclear interference terms in the breakup of @xmath0be on a medium mass @xmath1ti target and have also calculated the relative energy spectra for the breakup of @xmath0be on a heavy @xmath2pb target at 69 mev / nucleon for two different angular ranges of the projectile center of the mass scattering angle .",
    "the calculations were performed within the fully quantum mechanical framework of post - form dwba , where pure coulomb , pure nuclear as well as their interference terms were treated consistently within the same framework . in this theory , both",
    "the coulomb and nuclear interactions between the projectile and the target nucleus were treated to all orders , but the fragment - fragment interaction was treated in the first order .",
    "the full ground state wave function of the projectile corresponding to any orbital angular momentum structure enters as an input to this theory .",
    "the exact post - form dwba breakup amplitude was simplified with the lma and the validity of the approximation was verified by calculating several reaction observables in the breakup of @xmath0be in the coulomb and nuclear fields of several targets , in different mass ranges , in refs .",
    "recently , there have been attempts to calculate the exact post - form dwba without the lma , for pure coulomb breakup , with momentum space coulomb wave functions @xcite . while , this is indeed an welcome step , its practical applicability to calculate a wide variety of reaction observables is still an open question , particularly because it is numerically very intensive and time consuming .",
    "thus the lma still has practical applications , in this respect , particularly because along with its ability to factorise the coulomb breakup amplitude it is also able to treat coulomb and nuclear breakup on a single footing .",
    "nevertheless , efforts are in progress @xcite for the calculation of the post - form dwba breakup amplitude without the lma in a more analytic and less numerically intensive way than using momentum space coulomb wave functions .",
    "we calculated the neutron energy distributions for the breakup of @xmath0be on @xmath1ti at various beam energies and neutron emission angles . at 20 mev / nucleon , beam energy ,",
    "the coulomb breakup accounted for more of the cross section than nuclear breakup and the cni terms were constructive , in general .",
    "the importance of the cni terms were again highlighted by the calculation at the beam energy of 30 mev / nucleon , where the cni terms at low neutron emission angles , not only cancel out the nuclear terms , but also reduces the coulomb terms so that the coherent total sum is less than the coulomb terms . at 40 mev / nucleon , beam energy ,",
    "interference was generally constructive at smaller neutron angles , often being larger or almost equal to the individual nuclear terms ( @xmath66 ) , while at @xmath67 , especially from neutron energies of 20 mev to 35 mev , the destructive cni terms nearly cancels out the coulomb terms , and the nuclear terms are sole contributers to the total cross section . our results , thus , indicate that the cni terms are not only dependent on energies and angles of the outgoing fragments , they are also dependent on the incident beam energy . it would indeed be quite interesting if in a future experiment exclusive cross section measurements could be made at low beam energies where the effect of the cni terms were found to be substantial .",
    "calculations were also performed for the relative energy spectrum of the fragments ( neutron and @xmath57be ) emitted in the breakup of @xmath0be on @xmath2pb target at the beam energy of 69 mev / nucleon , for different angular ranges of the projectile c.m scattering angle ",
    "@xmath62 to @xmath63 and @xmath62 to @xmath65 . in the former angular range",
    "pure coulomb contributions dominate the cross sections around the peak value , while at larger relative energies the nuclear breakup is important . in the latter range , which is well below the grazing angle , for the reaction coulomb breakup",
    "dominates over the nuclear part .",
    "the total one - neutron removal cross section was found not to be affected by the cni terms as they manifest themselves explicitly in more exclusive measurements , like double differential cross sections than in quantities like total cross sections .    the full quantal theory of one - neutron halo breakup reactions , applied in this paper ,",
    "can also be used to describe the @xmath68 reaction provided the inelastic breakup mode is also calculated within this theory , which is expected to be straightforward .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical method outlined in this paper rely on the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation which in our opinion should be viewed only as an adequate starting point .",
    "there have been some attempts to use effective field methods to study halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is indeed a very new field and would be quite interesting to pursue in view of experiments of halo breakup at very high beam energies for which data have been taken at gsi , darmstadt .    it is a pleasure to thank prof .",
