    "models for the growth of complex networks often involve mechanisms that are based on _ global _ knowledge of the network .",
    "for example , in preferential attachment  @xcite , nodes are added sequentially and each links to existing target nodes in the network according to an attachment rate @xmath9 that is an increasing function of the degree @xmath4 of the target node . according to this rule",
    ", incoming nodes must ` know ' the degree distribution of the entire network to correctly choose a target node . in real networks , however , it is not feasible that any new node has such detailed global knowledge .",
    "the impracticality of implementing a growth rule based on global knowledge has motivated alternatives to preferential attachment that rely on the incoming nodes exploiting only _ local _ knowledge of a small portion of the network .",
    "examples include attachment via spatial locality  @xcite and node similarity  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the local growth rule that exploits _ redirection _  @xcite . here",
    ", each incoming node selects a target node at random and links either to this target node ( probability @xmath0 ) , or to parent of the target node ( probability @xmath1 ) .",
    "this redirection rule is based on the network being directed so that the parent(s ) of any node is well defined .",
    "if each new node has only one outgoing link , redirection produces networks with a tree topology ; it is straightforward to extend redirection to allow each incoming node to attach to more than one node in the network  @xcite .",
    "the surprising feature of redirection with a fixed redirection probability @xmath1 is that it is mathematically equivalent to the global growth rule of shifted linear preferential attachment , where the rate of attaching a new node to a pre - existing node of degree @xmath4 is @xmath10 with @xmath11 , see @xcite .",
    "redirection is also highly efficient because one only needs to select a random node and identify its parent to add a node to the network .",
    "the time to create a network of @xmath3 nodes via redirection therefore scales linearly with @xmath3 .     depends on the degree @xmath12 of a randomly chosen target node and the degree @xmath13 of its parent , with @xmath14 an increasing function of @xmath13 and @xmath2 as @xmath15 . in this example , the degree of the parent node is large , so the new node is likely to attach to the parent . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the utility of redirection as a simple and efficient procedure that is equivalent to linear preferential attachment motivates us to exploit models that use slightly more comprehensive ( but still local ) degree information around the target node .",
    "specifically we allow the redirection probability @xmath14 to depend on the degrees of the target and parent nodes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ( fig .",
    "[ rules ] ) . in _",
    "hindered redirection _",
    ", @xmath14 is a decreasing function of the parent degree @xmath13 , a rule that leads to sub - linear preferential attachment growth  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the complementary situation of _ enhanced redirection _ , for which the redirection probability @xmath1 is an increasing function of the parent degree @xmath13 , with @xmath2 as @xmath15 .",
    "this seemingly - innocuous redirection rule gives rise to networks with several intriguing and practically relevant properties :    1 .",
    "* _ appearance of multiple macrohubs _ : * macrohubs are nodes whose degrees are a finite fraction of @xmath3 . while macrohubs arise in other models  @xcite , the resulting networks are singular , with nearly all nodes attached to a single macrohub . in the cases of superlinear preferential attachment , where @xmath16 with @xmath17  @xcite , and in the fitness model , where the attachment rate is proportional to both the degree @xmath4 and fitness of the target  @xcite , a single macrohub arises that is connected to almost all other nodes of the network .",
    "in contrast , enhanced redirection networks are highly disperse ( fig .",
    "[ typical ] ) , with interconnected hub - and - spoke structures that are reminiscent of airline route networks  @xcite .",
    "non - extensivity _ : * in many sparse networks , the degree distribution is extensive , with the number of nodes of degree @xmath4 , @xmath5 , proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this happens , for example , in linear preferential attachment where additionally the degree distribution has an algebraic tail , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , enhanced redirection leads to the non - extensive scaling @xmath21 the allowed range of the exponent @xmath22 is key .",
    "while past empirical studies have observed networks with degree exponent in the range @xmath7  @xcite ( see table  1 for some examples ) , the range @xmath7 is mathematically inconsistent for sparse networks because it leads to a divergent average degree as @xmath23 whenever the degree distribution obeys the standard scaling @xmath24 .",
    "a simple resolution of this dilemma is to relax the hypothesis of extensivity .",
    "we shall see that in enhanced redirection almost all nodes have degree 1 ( leaves ) .",
    "more precisely , the number @xmath25 of core nodes ( nodes with degree @xmath26 ) grows _ sub - linearly _ with @xmath3 , namely as @xmath27 with the exponent @xmath22 in the range @xmath7 .",
    "all @xmath5 with @xmath28 also grow as @xmath27 .",
    "this anomalous scaling can therefore be summarized as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are constants .",

    "the degree distribution evolves according to @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined as the respective probabilities that an incoming link is redirected _ from _ a node of degree @xmath4 , and redirected _ to _ a node of degree @xmath4 . the first ratio in eq .   accounts for instances in which the incoming node attaches directly to the target node .",
    "thus the term @xmath47 gives the probability that the randomly selected target node has degree @xmath4 and the incoming node is _ not _ redirected .",

    "one of the visually striking features of enhanced redirection networks is that they display large fluctuations from realization to realization , as are apparent from the examples in fig .",

    "since the number of core nodes @xmath34 and the number of nodes of fixed degree @xmath5 for @xmath28 all scale as @xmath27 ( eq .  ) , scaled distributions of @xmath75 and @xmath72 would progressively sharpen as @xmath3 increases if self - averaging holds .",
    "the lack of self - averaging implies a sensitive dependence on initial conditions where events early in the evolution have lasting effects on the network structure .",

    "we explore some of the consequences of this attraction to high - degree nodes .",
    "macrohubs always arise when @xmath78 , but they are easily detectable only when the exponent @xmath22 is notably smaller than 2 . figure [ nu ] shows that this happens when @xmath79 , and in this range macrohubs are clearly observed in all network realizations .",
    "when the redirection parameter is small , @xmath80 , it may be necessary to grow the network to an astronomically large value of @xmath3 to detect macrohubs with certainty .",

    "enhanced redirection is an appealing mechanism that produces networks with a variety of unusual features , including the existence of multiple macroscopic hubs , anomalous scaling of the degree distribution , and lack of self - averaging . unlike other models that produce macrohubs ,",
    "enhanced redirection is based solely on local growth rules and does not assume intrinsic differences between nodes .",
    "networks grown by enhanced redirection are highly disperse and typically consist of a set of loosely - connected macrohubs that is reminiscent of airline route networks  @xcite .",

    "such an anomalously slow decay is mathematically consistent with a finite average degree only if the number of nodes of fixed degrees scales sub - linearly with the number of nodes @xmath3 .",
    "enhanced redirection may thus provide the mechanism that underlies the wide range of networks  @xcite whose degree distributions apparently decay more slowly than @xmath267 .",
