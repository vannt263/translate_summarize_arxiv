    "high - gravity central stars ( cs ) of planetary nebulae ( pne ) display the hottest stage of stellar post - agb evolution just at the entrance of the white - dwarf cooling track on the way towards the stellar graveyard .",
    "these stars are in a short phase between decreasing mass loss and thus , less spectral contamination by features which are formed under the influence of strong stellar winds ( cf .",
    "kudritzki , these proceedings ) , and increasing gravity which , in interplay with radiative levitation , will wipe out all photospheric information about their progenitors",
    ".    we will show progress in analyses of high - gravity cspne and demonstrate that spectral analyses by means of non - lte model - atmosphere techniques ( sect .",
    "[ sect : spectralanalyses ] ) provide a powerful tool to investigate on properties of these stars and to determine constraints for evolutionary theory ( sect .",
    "[ sect : pg1159 ] ) .",
    "high - gravity post - agb stars , i.e. hot , compact stars , have arrived at extremely high effective temperatures ( @xmath0 up to @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus it appears that their flux maximum is located in the euv spectral range and they are intrinsically faint in the optical . for a reliable spectral analysis ,",
    "the evaluation of ionization equilibria is necessary for the determination of @xmath0 ( see sect.[sect : lsv4621 ] ) .",
    "since the strongest metal lines are found almost exclusively in the high - energy range , its accuracy is dependent on the availability of high - resolution and high - s / n spectra in the uv wavelength range .",
    "these have been provided e.g. by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , and the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) [ tab : sat ] ) .",
    "examples for analyses which have been performed based on data obtained with these ( [ tab : sat ] ) are given in sections [ sect : xmc ] and [ sect : pg1159 ] .",
    ".satellite instruments used for spectral analyses of high - gravity cs .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to constrain the initial - to - final mass relation , analyses of 35 lmc @xcite and 27 smc @xcite cs have be performed , based on imaging and spectroscopy by hst stis and the wide - field planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) . a comparison in the hertzsprung - russell diagram with evolutionary tracks of @xcite for lmc and smc metallicities yields average cs masses of 0.65m@xmath2 and 0.63m@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "although these analyses are free of distance uncertainty , the determination of @xmath0 by the zanstra method imposes an imponderable error which one has to be aware of .",
    "an analysis of seven lmc cs has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they used fuse and hst ( fos + stis ) spectra and employed nlte model - atmosphere techniques using the codes tlusty @xcite and , since most objects display wind features ( @xmath3 ) , cmfgen @xcite .",
    "the cs s @xmath0 range from 38 to 70kk and five of them have lmc abundances .",
    "since the surface gravity @xmath4 could not be determined from the uv spectra and adequate optical spectra are not available , it is adopted within @xmath5 in order to investigate on errors in the parameter determination .",
    "however , this analysis represents not the standard of modern spectral analysis because @xmath4 is not self - consistently determined .",
    "one has to be aware of this uncertainty although this analysis aims on a characterization of pne by better understanding of the cs @xmath6 pn system and on wind properties .    ) .",
    "the h - rich envelope ( @xmath7 ) prohibits an insight into the intershell matter . a ( v)ltp may lay bare this matter . ]",
    "newly available high - resolution uv spectra , obtained by hst stis and fuse , enabled @xcite to establish an improved temperature scale for seven hot hydrogen - rich cspn . within their nlte model - atmosphere analysis",
    ", they evaluated ionization balances of c , n , and o which show rich line spectra in the uv in order to derive @xmath0 precisely .",
    "@xcite extended this analysis to the use of the fevi / fevii ionization equilibrium .    in an on - going analysis of lsv+4621 @xcite ,",
    "all iron - group elements are considered individually . in sect .",
    "[ sect : lsv4621 ] , we show some details of this state - of - the - art spectral analysis .      while the hydrogen - rich stellar post - agb evolution is quite well understood , the picture of hydrogen - deficient evolution ( about 20% of all post - agb stars ) became clearer only in the last years ( cf .",
    "herwig , these proceedings ) .",
    "spectral analysis of these objects has placed challenges again and again to evolutionary theory and , vice versa , predictions from evolutionary model have been verified by spectral analysis .",
    "one example is the discovery of the nevii @xmath8 absorption line in optical spectra of three extremely hot pg1159-type cspn @xcite .",
    "an abundance analysis with nlte model atmospheres has shown that this line can be reproduced with a ne abundance of @xmath9 ( by mass ) in the photosphere .",
    "early calculations of @xcite could not explain the observation , although they predicted ne to be the fourth abundant element ( @xmath9 mass fraction , following c , o , and he ) just below the helium - burning shell  inaccessible for spectroscopy . new evolutionary models by @xcite , which consider a realistic overshoot adopted from hydrodynamical simulations , predict a mass fraction of about 3.5% of ne in the intershell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interior ] ) , in good agreement with the spectroscopic result .",
    "the recent identification of the nevii @xmath10 absorption line in fuv @xcite spectra ( obtained with fuse ) of six pg1159 stars , the presence of nevii @xmath8 in eight and of nevii @xmath11 in four pg1159 stars @xcite corroborates these evolutionary models .",
    "stellar atmospheres with a content of 2% of ne ( eleven times solar ) can reproduce well the observed nevii lines .",
    "it its worthwhile to note that @xcite have shown that the nevii @xmath12 line appears with a strong p cygni wind profile in the cs of the pne ngc 2371 , abell 78 , and k1 - 16 ( this is much stronger than the supposed ciii @xmath13 p cygni feature in these cs ) .",
    "another example is the reproduction of the chandra spectrum of the hydrogen- and helium - deficient star h1504 + 65 @xcite .",
    "the consideration of magnesium with a mass fraction of 2% significantly improved the spectral fit . for mg",
    "@xcite predicted an equal amount like that of ne , also just below the helium - burning shell .",
    "the reason for our special interest in hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars , especially in the pg1159 stars , lies in the fact , that these experience a ( very ) late thermal pulse ( cf .",
    "herwig , these proceedings ) during their evolution which mixes the entire hydrogen - rich envelope ( fig.[fig : interior ] ) into the intershell matter where hydrogen is burned then .",
    "spectroscopy of these stars provides a direct view on the former intershell matter and allows to conclude on details in nuclear and mixing processes in agb stars .",
    "we will now briefly summarize pg1159 abundance determinations based on recent hst and fuse spectrocopy .",
    "he , c , n , o , ne , mg , f ( sect.[sect : fluorine ] ) , and si are in line with predictions from evolutionary models @xcite and these proceedings , and jahn et al",
    "fe ( sect.[sect : iron ] ) shows a surprisingly large depletion , as well as s ( sect.[sect : sulfur ] ) .",
    "p is predicted to be overabundant by a factor of up to 25 ( still uncertain ) but is found to be roughly solar @xcite .    for a more detailed review on elemental abundances in bare cspn ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "evolutionary calculations predict a reduced , i.e. sub - solar , fe intershell abundance due to",
    "n - captures in the s - process .",
    "the fuse wavelength range covers the strongest fevii lines ( this is the dominant ionization stage in hot pg1159 stars ) . up to now",
    ", fuse spectra of three pg1159 stars with sufficiently high s / n have been analyzed but no iron lines are detectable .",
    "thus , a very strong fe depletion ( at least @xmath14 ) takes place in the intershell @xcite .      the first discovery of fluorine ( fvi@xmath15 ) in fuse spectra of hot post - agb stars",
    "@xcite has shown that agb stars are efficiently synthesizing fluorine which even survives a ( v)ltp  abundances of up to @xmath16 solar have been determined in pg1159 stars .",
    "measurements in pne ( zhang & liu , these proceedings ) have found that f is generally overabundant in pne , thus providing new evidence for its synthesis in agb stars .",
    "the photospheric abundance of sulfur should not be changed by nuclear processes .",
    "a recent spectral analysis of pg1159@xmath17035 @xcite has shown , however , that s is strongly underabundant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sulfur ] ) .",
    "035 showing the svi resonance doublet .",
    "obviously , s is strongly underabundant ( about 0.02 of the solar abundance ) . ]",
    "recently , @xcite reported on the first directly measured ( spectropolarimetry with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 ) attached to the very large telescope ( vlt ) ) magnetic fields ( @xmath18 of the order of kg ) in four cs ( of the pne ngc1360 , egb5 , lss1362 , a36 ) . from these field strengths ( under assumption of complete flux conservation )",
    ", they estimate that the main - sequence precursors had field strengths of the order of some g. the later white dwarfs ( wds ) will have fields of some mg .",
    "many wds with such strong fields are indeed known . however , the influence of magnetic fields on the morphology of pne is still under debate and this first measurement is a valuable help to quantify their impact in magneto - hydrodynamical modeling .    a possible measurement of the zeeman splitting ( cf .",
    "stanghellini et al . , these proceedings ) of an oiv line in a high - resolution optical spectrum of the cspn of he2 - 36 yields even a higher field strength of @xmath19 .",
    "pne are detected only around every other pg1159 star . depending on their individual evolution , the pne which have been ejected on the agb",
    "have most likely dispersed under the detection limit . over the last years we spent some time with the search of nebular emission around pg1159 stars and related objects .",
    "our search has been entirely negative but for do white dwarf pg0109 + 111 @xcite where a possible pn was found with a diameter of 0.8pc .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered a pn ( hewett 1 ) around the do pg1034 + 001 with a diameter of @xmath20 .",
    "an investigation on data of the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa , @xcite ) by @xcite has shown that an enormous ionized halo exists around this object with a diameter of @xmath21 . an ionized nebula has also been found by @xcite around the do kpd0005 + 5106 .",
    "since the ionized mass is about @xmath22 this is unambiguously ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the nebula around pg1034 + 001 is simply ionized ism .",
    "frey ( these proceedings ) also expects this for pg0109 + 111 s nebula .",
    "although all these emissivities are probably no pne , the importance of hot white dwarfs as ionizing sources for the ism is quite evident .",
