    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc / smc ) possess rich stellar clusters of masses comparable to milky way globular clusters ( mwgc ) , but with ages @xmath1 yr .",
    "these two systems therefore permit direct observational studies of globular cluster evolution .",
    "we have assembled and reduced archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) data for 53 lmc and 10 smc clusters spanning the full age range , and have measured parameters such as the core radius @xmath2 and the total mass and luminosity for each cluster using surface brightness profiles ( mackey & gilmore 2002a ; 2002b ) .",
    "our results , figure 1(a ) , show a clear trend in @xmath0 with increasing age for both systems , including an apparent bifurcation of the distribution at @xmath3 yr so that old clusters may have either large or small @xmath0 . as discussed in mackey & gilmore ( 2002a , 2002b ) , we conclude that the observed trend with age represents genuine physical evolution of clusters in these two systems .",
    "the mechanism by which some clusters undergo large scale core expansion while otherwise similar clusters do not is as yet unidentified , and we are exploring possibilities via @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "another avenue of investigation is to observe whether any other local systems show globular clusters with expanded cores . unlike the lmc / smc clusters , all other local globular clusters are old ( @xmath5 yr ) .",
    "fornax and sagittarius ( sgr ) are the two most massive dsph galaxies associated with the milky way , and the only two to have globular clusters .",
    "fornax has five ( c1-c5 ) while sgr has four ( m54 , ter 7 , ter 8 , arp 2 ) plus one clearly previously associated ( pal 12 ) . again using archival hst data ,",
    "we have measured @xmath0 of @xmath6 pc , @xmath7 pc , @xmath8 pc , @xmath9 pc , and @xmath10 pc for fornax c1-c5 respectively ( mackey & gilmore 2002c ) .",
    "like the old lmc / smc clusters , these clusters are either compact ( @xmath11 pc ) or expanded ( @xmath12 pc ) . from the catalogue of harris ( 1996 ) the sgr clusters have @xmath0 of @xmath13 pc , @xmath14 pc , @xmath15 pc , @xmath16 pc , and @xmath17 pc for m54 , ter 7 , ter 8 , arp 2 , and pal 12 respectively . we again observe a similar @xmath0 distribution .",
    "we also examine the mwgc system , using the data of harris .",
    "the mwgc system may be split by [ fe / h ] and horizontal branch type according to the prescription of zinn ( 1993 ) .",
    "plotting binned @xmath0 distributions for each subsystem , figure 1(b ) , we see each is distinct , with the `` young '' halo subsystem containing the majority of clusters with large cores",
    ". we can form a composite `` satellite '' system , containing the old lmc / smc clusters , and the fornax and sgr dsph clusters .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution for this system appears very similar to that for the `` young '' halo subsystem .",
    "a simple k - s test shows the unbinned distributions to be similar at @xmath18 significance . the satellite system and",
    "the thick - disk and `` old '' halo subsystems are different at @xmath19 and @xmath20 significances respectively .",
    "this result supports zinn s ( 1993 ) hypothesis that the `` young '' halo clusters have been accreted from destroyed satellite galaxies , while the thick - disk and `` old '' halo clusters are mostly intrinsic to the milky way .",
    "alternatively , if one already accepts this picture , our result shows that clusters with large cores do not survive ( or perhaps form ) in regions with strong tidal fields .",
    "core expansion may therefore be exclusively a weak - field effect .",
