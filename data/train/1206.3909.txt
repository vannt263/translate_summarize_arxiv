    "computer simulations of protein folding into native structures can be achieved when both of the following two requirements are met : ( 1 ) potential energy functions ( or , force fields ) for the protein systems are sufficiently accurate and ( 2 ) sufficiently powerful conformational sampling methods are available .",
    "professor harold a. scheraga has been one of the most important pioneers in studies of both of the above requirements @xcite . by the developments of the generalized - ensemble algorithms ( for reviews ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and related methods , requirement ( 2 ) seems to be almost fulfilled . in this article , we therefore concentrate our attention on requirement ( 1 ) .",
    "there are several well - known all - atom ( or united - atom ) force fields , such as amber @xcite , charmm @xcite , opls @xcite , gromos @xcite , gromacs @xcite , and ecepp @xcite . generally , the force - field parameters are determined based on experimental results for small molecules and theoretical results using quantum chemistry calculations of small peptides such as alanine dipeptide .    in a force field",
    ", the potential energy is usually composed of the bond - stretching term , the bond - bending term , the torsion - energy term , and the nonbonded energy term . in these energy terms",
    ", it is known that the torsion - energy term is the most problematic .",
    "for instance , the ff94 @xcite and ff96 @xcite versions of amber differ only in the main - chain torsion - energy parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the secondary - structure - forming tendencies of the two force fields are quite different @xcite .",
    "therefore , many researchers have studied this main - chain torsion - energy terms and their force - field parameters .",
    "for instance , newer force - field parameters of the main - chain torsion - energy terms about @xmath4 and @xmath0 angles have been developed , which are , e.g. , amber ff99sb @xcite , amber ff03 @xcite , charmm22/cmap @xcite and opls - aa / l @xcite .",
    "the methods of the force - field refinement thus mainly concentrate on the torsion - energy terms .",
    "these modifications of the torsion energy are usually based on quantum chemistry calculations @xcite or nmr experimental results @xcite .",
    "we have also proposed a new main - chain torsion - energy term , which is represented by a double fourier series in two variables , the main - chain dihedral angles @xmath4 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this expression gives a natural representation of the torsion energy in the ramachandran space @xcite in the sense that any two - dimensional energy surface periodic in both @xmath4 and @xmath0 can be expanded by the double fourier series .",
    "we can then easily control secondary - structure - forming tendencies by modifying the main - chain torsion - energy surface .",
    "we have presented preliminary results for amber ff94 and amber ff96 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have introduced several optimization methods of force - field parameters @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the minimization of some score functions by simulations in the force - field parameter space , where the score functions are derived from the protein coordinate data in the protein data bank ( pdb ) .",
    "one of the score functions consists of the sum of the square of the force acting on each atom in the proteins with the structures from the pdb @xcite .",
    "other score functions are taken from the root - mean - square deviations between the original pdb structures and the corresponding minimized structures @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose a new type of the main - chain torsion - energy terms for protein systems , which can have amino - acid - dependent force - field parameters . as an example of this formulation",
    ", we applied this approach to the amber ff03 force field and determined new amino - acid - dependent main - chain torsion - energy parameters for @xmath0 ( n - c@xmath5-c - n ) and @xmath1 ( c@xmath6-c@xmath5-c - n ) by using our optimization method in refs @xcite .    in section 2 the details of the new main - chain torsion - energy terms",
    "are given . in section 3",
    "the results of applications of the method to amber ff03 force field and those of folding simulations of two peptides are presented .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the existing force fields for protein systems such as amber @xcite , charmm @xcite , and opls @xcite , etc .",
    "use essentially the same functional forms for the potential energy @xmath7 except for minor differences .",
    "the conformational potential energy @xmath7 can be written as , for instance , @xmath8 here , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represent the bond - stretching term , the bond - bending term , the torsion - energy term , and the nonbonded energy term , respectively .",
    "each force field has similar but slightly different parameter values .",
    "for example , the torsion - energy term is usually given by @xmath13 \\right\\}~ ,   \\label{ene_torsion1}\\ ] ] where the first summation is taken over all dihedral angles @xmath14 ( both in the main chain and in the side chains ) , @xmath15 is the number of waves , @xmath16 is the phase , and @xmath17 is the fourier coefficient .",
    "namely , the energy term @xmath11 has @xmath18 and @xmath19 as force - field parameters",
    ".    we can further write the torsion - energy term as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the torsion - energy terms for dihedral angles around main - chain bonds and around side - chain bonds , respectively .",
    "examples of the dihedral angles in @xmath21 are @xmath4 ( c - n - c@xmath5-c ) , @xmath0 ( n - c@xmath5-c - n ) , @xmath23 ( c@xmath6-c@xmath5-n - c ) , @xmath1 ( c@xmath6-c@xmath5-c - n ) , and @xmath24 ( c@xmath5-c - n - c@xmath5 ) .",
    "the force - field parameters in @xmath22 can readily depend on amino - acid residues .",
    "however , those in @xmath21 are usually taken to be independent of amino - acid residues and the common parameter values are used for all the amino - acid residues ( except for proline ) .",
    "this is because the amino - acid dependence of the force field is believed to be taken care of by the very existence of side chains . in table",
    "i , we list examples of the parameter values for @xmath0 ( n - c@xmath5-c - n ) and @xmath1 ( c@xmath6-c@xmath5-c - n ) in general amber force fields",
    ".    however , this amino - acid independence of the main - chain torsion - energy terms is not an absolute requirement , because we are representing the entire force field by rather a small number of classical - mechanical terms . in order to reproduce the exact quantum - mechanical contributions",
    ", one can introduce amino - acid dependence on any force - field term including the main - chain torsion - energy terms .",
    "hence , we can generalize @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion2 ] ) from the expression in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion1 ] ) to the following amino - acid - dependent form :    @xmath25 \\right\\}~ ,   \\label{ene_torsion3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the label for the 20 kinds of amino - acid residues and @xmath28 are dihedral angles around the main - chain bonds in the @xmath26-th amino - acid residue .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have generalized the main - chain torsion - energy term @xmath21 so that its parameters are amino - acid dependent . the question is then how to obtain optimal parameter values for this new main - chain torsion - energy term .",
    "one method is to use the parameter optimization method that was introduced in refs .",
    "we first retrieve @xmath29 native structures ( one structure per protein ) from pdb .",
    "we try to choose proteins from different amino - acid sequence homology as much as possible . if the force - field parameters are of ideal values , then all the chosen native structures are stable without any force acting on each atom in the molecules on the average .",
    "hence , we expect @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the total number of atoms in molecule @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the total potential energy for molecule @xmath34 , and @xmath36 is the force acting on atom @xmath37 . in reality ,",
    "@xmath38 , and because @xmath39 , we can optimize the force - field parameters by minimizing @xmath40 with respect to these parameters in the main - chain torsion - energy term in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion3 ] ) . in practice",
    ", we perform a minimization simulation in the main - chain torsion - energy force - field parameter space for this minimization @xcite .",
    "we present the results of our optimizations of the force - field parameters @xmath41 for the main - chain angles @xmath42 @xmath43 ( n - c@xmath5-c - n ) and @xmath44 ( c@xmath6-c@xmath5-c - n ) in eq .",
    "( [ ene_torsion3 ] ) .",
    "we did this for the case of amber ff03 force field .",
    "we determined these @xmath41 values for the 19 amino - acid residues except for proline .    at first",
    ", we chose 100 pdb files with resolution 2.0   or better , with sequence similarity of amino acid 30.0 % or lower , and with less than 200 residues ( the average number of residues is 117.0 ) from pdb - reprdb @xcite ( see table  [ pdb_list ] ) .",
    "we then refined these selected 100 structures .",
    "generally , data from x - ray experiments do not have coordinates for hydrogen atoms .",
    "therefore , we have to add hydrogen coordinates .",
    "many protein simulation software packages provide with routines that add hydrogen atoms to the pdb coordinates .",
    "we used the amber11 program package @xcite .",
    "we thus minimized the total potential energy @xmath45 with respect to the coordinates for each proten conformation , where @xmath46 is the harmonic constraint energy term ( @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 is the solvation energy term . here , @xmath49 is the force constant of the restriction and @xmath50 are the original coordinate vectors of heavy atoms in pdb . as one can see from @xmath46 , the coordinates of hydrogen atoms will be mainly adjusted , but unnatural heavy - atom coordinates will also be modified .",
    "we performed this minimization for all the 100 protein structures separately and obtained 100 refined structures by using @xmath51 ( kcal / mol ) .",
    "as for the solvation energy term @xmath48 , we used the gb / sa solvent included in the amber program package ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "for these refined protein structures , we performed the optimization of force - field parameters @xmath54 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 angles for amber ff03 force field by using the fucntion @xmath40 in eq .",

    ", we used amber11 @xcite for the force calculations in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "we have to optimize the 38 ( @xmath56 ) parameters simultaneously by the simulations in 38 parameters .",
    "however , here , for simplicity , we just optimized two parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for each amino - acid residue @xmath26 separately , keeping the other @xmath59 values as the original values . in order to obtain the optimal parameters",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations of two parameters ( @xmath59 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) for the 19 amino - acid residues except for proline . in table",
    "[ table - opt - parameters ] , the optimized parameters are listed .      in order to check the force - field parameters obtained by our optimization method",
    ", we performed the folding simulations using two peptides , namely , c - peptide of ribonuclease a and the c - terminal fragment of the b1 domain of streptococcal protein g , which is sometimes referred to as g - peptide @xcite .",
    "the c - peptide has 13 residues and its amino - acid sequence is lys - glu@xmath60-thr - ala - ala - ala - lys@xmath61-phe - glu - arg@xmath61-gln - his@xmath61-met .",
    "this peptide has been extensively studied by experiments and is known to form an @xmath2-helix structure @xcite . because the charges at peptide termini are known to affect helix stability @xcite , the n and c termini of the peptide was blocked with acetyl and n - methyl groups , respectively .",

    "this peptide is known to form a @xmath3-hairpin structure by experiments @xcite .    for the folding simulations , we used replica - exchange molecular dynamics ( remd ) @xcite .",
    "remd is one of the generalized - ensemble algorithms , and has high conformational sampling efficiency by allowing configurations to heat up and cool down while maintaining proper boltzmann distributions .",
    "we used the amber11 program package @xcite .",
    "the unit time step was set to 2.0 fs , and the bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained by shake algorithm @xcite . each simulation was carried out for 30.0 ns ( hence , it consisted of 15,000,000 md steps ) with 16 replicas by using langevin dynamics .",
