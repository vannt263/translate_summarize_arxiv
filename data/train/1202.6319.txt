    "the most important transport process for energetic charged particles in the heliosphere is their spatial diffusion as a consequence of their interaction with the turbulent heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) . while rarely used in models of galactic transport , the concept of _ anisotropic diffusion _ is well established ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for models of heliospheric cosmic ray ( cr ) modulation . in most studies",
    "the anisotropy refers to a difference in the diffusion coefficient parallel ( @xmath0 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath1 ) to the magnetic field , and the perpendicular diffusion is treated as being isotropic .",
    "although the notion of fully anisotropic diffusion is not new  see an early study by @xcite considering for the first time _ anisotropic perpendicular diffusion _ , i.e.  @xmath2  it was not before the measurements made with the ulysses spacecraft that this concept had to be used to explain the high - latitude observations of cosmic rays , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these studies remained largely phenomenological and did not attempt a rigorous investigation of anisotropic perpendicular diffusion .",
    "more recently , in the context of studies of the transport of solar energetic particles in the heliospheric parker field , @xcite and @xcite have determined the elements of the diffusion tensor from test particle simulations in a local , field - aligned frame .",
    "while the former authors find no conclusive result , the latter authors clearly demonstrated that the scattering in the inhomogeneous parker field can indeed induce anisotropic perpendicular diffusion .",
    "given this phenomenological and simulation - based evidence it is important to determine the principal directions of perpendicular diffusion in the field - aligned local frame , because the transformation of the diffusion tensor from a correspondingly oriented local into a global coordinate system determines the exact form of the tensor elements in the latter , in which the transport equation is usually solved .",
    "this is of particular importance in the case of symmetry - free magnetic fields , like the so - called fisk field @xcite .",
    "the latter is  although in a weaker manner than originally suspected @xcite  still a valid generalisation of the parker field and takes into account a non - vanishing latitudinal field component .    while it has been recognized that the use of the fisk field in models of the heliospheric modulation of crs requires a re - derivation of the diffusion tensor @xcite the formulas given in these papers differ from each other and are either valid only for the case of isotropic perpendicular diffusion ( the former two papers ) or for a specific orientation of the local coordinate system ( the latter paper ) .",
    "consequently , there are two open issues , namely ( i ) to determine which of these formulas are correct ( see also appendix a ) and ( ii ) to generalize these results to the case of anisotropic perpendicular diffusion . with the present paper",
    "we address both issues by deriving general formulas for the transformation of a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor .",
    "in addition to establishing the appropriate description , we apply the new generalized formulas to a standard modulation problem in order to demonstrate the physical significance of the approach .",
    "]    anisotropic perpendicular transport can , in principle , result ( i ) from an inhomogeneous ( asymmetric ) magnetic background field or ( ii ) from turbulence that is intrinsically non - axisymmetric with respect to the ( homogeneous ) local magnetic field direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . while the latter case has been discussed in the context of energetic particle transport @xcite partly motivated by the observed ratios of the power in the microscale magnetic field fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the background field : @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is aligned to the latitudinal unit vector and the normalized @xmath5 completes the local trihedron , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recent analyses indicate that the perpendicular fluctuations are probably axisymmetric @xcite . therefore , we consider the first case of an inhomogeneous magnetic background field to be more likely to cause fully anisotropic diffusion .",
    "if the random walk of field lines due to turbulence is significantly contributing to the perpendicular particle transport , one generally has to expect the latter to be anisotropic .",
    "this can be illustrated already for the simple case that the hmf is represented by the parker spiral , see fig .",
    "[ fig : turb - hmf - parker ] : due to the field geometry the field line wandering is not isotropic , neither in radial direction nor in heliographic latitude , resulting in a field line diffusion coefficient depending on both @xcite .",
    "as soon as anisotropic perpendicular diffusion occurs , it is necessary to determine the principal axes of the diffusion tensor in a local field - aligned frame ( @xmath6 ) , because their orientation determines the tensor elements in the global frame ( @xmath7 ) after a corresponding transformation given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 where , in general , @xmath10 denotes the drift coefficient , induced by a non - axisymmetric turbulence and by inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "the latter drifts can always be described by a drift velocity @xmath11 in the transport equation @xcite and are therefore not considered in the following . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , analogous to the euler angle transformation known from classical mechanics , the matrix @xmath12 describes three consecutive rotations @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "these rotations are defined by the relative orientation of the local and the global coordinate system with respect to each other .    due to the latitudinal structuring of the solar wind and , in turn , of the parker spiral having a vanishing @xmath15-component",
    ", one may argue that in that case the latitudinal direction remains a preferred one so that the local coordinate system could always be defined by the unit vectors @xmath16 ( along the field ) , @xmath17 ( from a spherical polar coordinate system ) and @xmath18 .",
    "this , however , can obviously not be the case for symmetry - free fields like the fisk field @xcite .",
    "in general , the local trihedron will consist of a unit vector @xmath16 tangential to the magnetic field and two orthogonal ones , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , defining the remaining principal axes . with this notation the transformation ( 1 ) reads , for an arbitrary choice of this local trihedron : @xmath21 where the components of @xmath22 and @xmath20 are determined in the global coordinate system .",
    "consequently , the task is to determine the unit vectors @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for an arbitrary , symmetry - free magnetic field .    given that the perpendicular fluctuations are probably axisymmetric @xcite as discussed above , we assume @xmath23 in the following .    with this explicit formulation of the tensor elements we can already address issue ( i ) defined in section  1",
    ": for the case that the perpendicular diffusion is isotropic , i.e.  @xmath24 , the formulas given by @xcite , see appendix a , are identical to eq .",
    "( 3 ) to ( 11 ) , so that their correction of the results found by @xcite and @xcite and , in turn , their subsequent analysis are validated .",
    "we emphasize , however , that neither of these formulations ( involving only two rotation angles ) allow to define explicitly the perpendicular diffusion axes , which are nessesary to treat anisotropic diffusion in the most general form .",
    "in the absence of symmetries there remain two distinguished local directions that , at a given location within an arbitrary magnetic field , are related to its curvature @xmath25 and torsion @xmath26 and are called the normal and the binormal direction .",
    "they can be defined with the corresponding normal and binormal unit vectors , respectively .",
    "together with the tangential unit vector , they constitute a local orthogonal trihedron fulfilling the ( @xmath25- and @xmath26-defining ) frenet - serret relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath27 if no other diffusion axes are preferred by any process , the frenet - serret system constituted by the above definition of @xmath16 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the most natural choice , i.e.@xmath30 and @xmath31 in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) to ( 11 ) .",
    "the transformation of the local diffusion tensor into a global coordinate system according to these equations thus requires knowledge of the dependence of the frenet - serret vectors on a given ( non - homogeneous ) magnetic field @xmath32 .",
    "evidently , the required relations are @xmath33 this trihedron can , of course , only be established for a spatially non - homogeneous field , but this ( weak ) condition is fulfilled in most cases of interest . if there would exist a region where the field is homogeneous , the choice of the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 is arbitrary ( signifying isotropic perpendicular diffusion ) unless no other preferential directions unrelated to the field geometry can be specified . other principal directions unrelated to the large - scale geometry of the field could , for example , arise from non - axisymmetric turbulence .",
    "the above formulas ( 3 ) to ( 11 ) remain unaffected , however : one only needs to specify the appropriate vectors @xmath34 and @xmath29 .    in the following we illustrate the procedure with the example of the well - studied hmf .",
    "we quantitatively compare the new tensor with the traditional one , which is only valid for isotropic perpendicular diffusion .",
    "this comparison reveals that a study of fully anisotropic turbulent diffusion within more complicated fields  like the much - discussed heliospheric fisk field @xcite or complex galactic magnetic fields @xcite  has to be performed with even more caution than thought before .     while for the frenet - serret trihedron one axis ( the @xmath35-binormal axis , orange ) is nearly parallel to the @xmath36-direction . in the ecliptic both",

    "this diffusion ( determined by @xmath35 ) can not transport particles from the boundary into the inner heliosphere , it merely distributes the particles on a shell of fixed heliocentric distance . in the new tensor formulation exists thus a form of pseudo drift produced by the off - diagonal tensor elements in the global frame , which were different or even equal to zero in the traditional formulation .",

    "we have derived , in a global reference frame , the general form of the diffusion tensor of energetic particles in arbitrary magnetic fields .",
    "this new formulation particularly includes the case of anisotropic perpendicular diffusion that arises from field line wandering or scattering due to turbulence and requires a determination of both principal ( orthogonal ) perpendicular diffusion directions . unless the turbulence is non - axisymmetric , which appears to be unlikely for the solar wind , the natural choice for these principal directions is the frenet - serret trihedron associated with the curvature and torsion of the magnetic field lines .    after the derivation of the formulas for all tensor elements in dependence of the frenet - serret unit vectors , we have first quantitatively compared the results to those published previously for the example of the heliospheric magnetic field . for the latter we have discussed two well - established alternatives , namely the parker field and the hybrid fisk field . while the old and new tensor formulations coincide for the case of isotropic perpendicular diffusion , the more general case of anisotropic perpendicular diffusion can not be treated consistently with the earlier approaches .",
    "this is manifest in significant differences of corresponding tensor elements including additional non - vanishing ones .",
    "second , we have demonstrated the consequences of the new tensor formulation in application to the modulation of galactic cosmic ray proton spectra in the parker heliospheric magnetic field . solving the cosmic ray transport equation with the method of stochastic differential equations allowed us to quantify the differences between the spectra resulting from both tensor formulations for the case of perpendicular diffusion with an anisotropy of @xmath82 .",
    "we found those differences to amount up to 60% at energies below a few hundred mev .",
    "given that we used for this first principal assessment an anisotropy that is moderate as compared to findings from detailed transport and modulation studies , the fluxes can be influenced even more strongly and at even higher energies .",
    "besides the fact that the above results indicate the necessity to study the case of fully anisotropic diffusion in more detail within the framework of more sophisticated models of heliospheric cosmic ray modulation , they can furthermore be expected to be of importance for the particle transport in complex galactic magnetic fields for which usually isotropic ( scalar ) diffusion has been considered so far .",
