    "we calculate the deuteron form factors in the framework of the explicitly covariant version of light - front dynamics ( see for review @xcite ) . in this approach",
    "one can use in full measure the knowledge of the nonrelativistic wave functions and incorporate selfconsistently the relativistic effects .",
    "we assume that the nucleons interact with each other by exchanging the same mesons that are incorporated in the @xmath1 potential , however we do nt use any nonrelativistic potential approximation .",
    "in the explicitly covariant formulation of light - front dynamics the wave function is defined in the space - time on the plane formally given by the light - front equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the four - vector with @xmath4 .",
    "this restores the relativistic covariance in comparison to the standard light - front approach .",
    "the latter is obtained as a particular case for @xmath5 .",
    "the wave functions depend on the orientation of the light front , as they should .",
    "this dependence is covariantly parametrized in terms of the four - vector @xmath3 .",
    "the explicit covariance allows to construct the general form of the light - front wave function for a system with given spin .",
    "the relativistic deuteron wave function on the light front contains six spin components , in contrast to two components  s and d - waves  in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "its general form was found in @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we keep only three dominating components @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the relativistic deuteron wave function was calculated in @xcite by a perturbative way incorporating exact relativistic obep kernel found in light - front dynamics , and the nonrelativistic wave function as the starting point . for the kernel",
    "the set of six mesons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and the parameters corresponding to the bonn model @xcite were used .    in nonrelativistic region of @xmath10 the components @xmath11 and @xmath12 found by this way turn into the usual s- and d - waves , whereas other components become negligible .",
    "however , starting from @xmath13 gev / c the component @xmath7 dominates over all other components , including @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the physical meaning of this dominating extra component has been clarified @xcite by comparing , in @xmath14 approximation , the analytical expression for the amplitude of the deuteron electrodisintegration near threshold with the nonrelativistic one , including meson exchange currents . for the isovector transition , in the region , where so called pair term with the pion exchange dominates , this component ( together with similar component in the scattering state ) automatically incorporates 50% of the contribution of the pair term and therefore dominates too .",
    "another 50% is given by the contact ( instantaneous ) interaction ( see below ) .",
    "a peculiarity of the light - front dynamics is the presence of the so called instantaneous ( or contact ) interaction @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the meson @xmath17 , etc .",
    "this is a trace of disappeared diagrams corresponding to vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the fermion fields in this interaction are sandwiched with the factor @xmath18 that in the standard approach is the well known @xmath19 ( in addition to the standard factors of the nucleon - meson lagrangian , like @xmath20 , etc . ) .",
    "therefore the full electromagnetic vertex which we use to calculate the deuteron form factors corresponds to the sum of the impulse approximation and of the contact interaction .",
    "it partially takes into account the many - body currents . for the contact interaction",
    "we take into account the sum over all six mesons contributing to the bonn potential , with the parameters of the bonn model @xcite .",
    "the next step is to extract the deuteron form factors from the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "the physical amplitudes should not depend on the orientation of the light - front plane .",
    "however in practice , because of the incompatibility between the transformation properties of the approximate e.m .",
    "current and the wave function , the nonphysical @xmath3 dependence survives in the on - energy shell deuteron electromagnetic vertex . due to covariance , the general form of this dependence can be found explicitly and then separated from the physical form factors .",
    "the explicit formulas extracting the physical form factors @xmath21 from the nonphysical contributions were found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the polarization observable @xmath0 measured in experiment is a combination of the form factors ( see e.g. @xcite ) . besides momentum transfer it depends also explicitly on @xmath22",
    "our prediction @xcite for the polarization observable @xmath0 together with the most recent measurements are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the calculation is in close agreement with the existing experimental data in all the momentum range , including the new results obtained at tjnaf / cebaf @xcite which corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "this coincidence means that the deuteron structure at small distances is understood rather well .",
    "it is given by the relativistic nucleon - meson dynamics . in its turn",
    ", the relativistic nucleon - meson dynamics is well described theoretically , in the framework of the phenomenological nucleon - meson lagrangian .",
    "the parameters of this lagrangian are found phenomenologically .",
    "their calculation in the framework of qcd is a separate problem .",
    "this allows us to make the general conclusion that : _ in a large extent the relativistic nuclear physics can be developed independently of its derivation from qcd .",
    "_    however , these results can be improved in many respects .",
    "an exact solution of the equation for the deuteron is indeed feasible .",
    "it implies the redefinition of the parameters of the nn kernel in the framework of the light - front equations .",
    "this necessitates also a careful treatment of higher order contributions to the kernel .",
    "finally , the calculation of electromagnetic observables should include higher fock states ( @xmath24 , etc . ) and the meson exchange currents corresponding to the direct interaction of the photon with the intermediate mesons .",
