    "<S> layered local - moment systems ( e.g. layered perovskites@xcite r@xmath7mo@xmath8 ( r is some element , m is the transition metal ) and undoped parent compounds for high - tc superconductors ) are distinctly different from the cubic magnets because of the reduced value of magnetic transition ( curie or neel ) temperature , since it is determined in these systems mainly by weak interlayer exchange or anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> relatively small values of magnetic transition temperatures allow for both theoretical and experimental study of the evolution of magnetic properties in layered systems in the whole temperature range @xmath9 and some temperature region above @xmath10 .    at low temperatures magnetic excitations in layered ( as well , as cubic systems ) are described by the spin wave theory , considering periodic twists of spins with respect to the ordered state . </S>",

    "<S> such an analysis gives also a possibility to investigate the crossover between the two regimes , which corresponds physically to changing relevant magnetic fluctuations from spin - wave to the critical ones . </S>",
