    "the strong coupling between elastic and breakup channels in direct nuclear reactions involving deuterons led to the development of the continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) method where an effective three - body problem is solved approximately via the expansion of the full wave function in a selected set of continuum wave functions of a given pair subsystem hamiltonian .",
    "initial work by johnson and soper @xcite showed that deuteron breakup was very important to understand reactions involving the deuteron . in that work ,",
    "a two channel problem was solved where the deuteron continuum was represented by a single discrete s - state .",
    "later developments by rawitscher @xcite and austern @xcite helped to introduce a more realistic representation of the continuum ; further numerical implementations of the method proved its feasibility @xcite . originally applied to reactions with the deuteron ( e.g. @xcite ) , it has since been extended to describe reactions with radioactive nuclear beams ( e.g. @xcite ) , namely to study elastic , transfer and breakup cross sections that result from the collision of a halo nucleus with a proton or a stable heavier target such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite cdcc results obtained with two different basis sets , namely the basis set using the continuum of the projectile in the entrance channel , and the one using the continuum of the composite system in the final transfer channel , led to substantially different breakup cross sections for @xmath9 .",
    "these findings raise concern about the accuracy of the cdcc method , not only as a means to describe reaction dynamics , but also as an accurate tool to extract structure information on halo nuclei .",
    "an alternative approach to the solution of effective three - body problems is the solution of the faddeev equations @xcite for the wave function components or the equivalent alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite for the transition operators .",
    "the application of exact faddeev / ags equations to the study of direct nuclear reactions has been shadowed in the past by the difficulty in dealing with the long range coulomb force between charged particles @xcite . in recent calculations for the reaction @xmath0 @xcite",
    "separable potentials are used and the coulomb is taken into account only approximately .",
    "given the progress achieved recently @xcite for @xmath10 elastic scattering and breakup we can now address the solution of effective three - body systems where two of the particles have charge .",
    "this was done first for @xmath11 elastic scattering and breakup @xcite and later for @xmath12 elastic scattering and breakup @xcite where @xmath6 is a halo nucleus made up of a neutron and an inert @xmath13 core .",
    "more recently the same system was used to study the convergence of the faddeev / ags multiple scattering series @xcite at intermediate energy as a means to test the glauber method . in all these works @xcite we solve the ags equations without resorting to a separable representation of the underlying interactions .",
    "therefore the corresponding two - vector - variable integral equations are numerically solved without any approximations beyond the usual partial - wave decomposition and discretization of momentum meshes .",
    "although cdcc was initially introduced as a practical way of solving a complicated three - body scattering problem through a set of coupled schrdinger - like equations , later works @xcite tried to obtain a more formal justification of the method , by relating it to a truncation of an orderly set of faddeev equations .",
    "furthermore , it is argued that the cdcc solution approaches the exact ( faddeev ) solution as the model space is increased .",
    "although qualitative arguments are provided in those works to support the conclusions , they lack a numerical comparison between the cdcc and faddeev methods in specific cases .",
    "the possibility of performing this comparison , thanks to the recent developments in the numerical implementation of the ags equations , is another motivation for the present work .    given these important new developments we propose here to benchmark , in a few test cases , cdcc results with exact solutions of the ags equations . for this comparison",
    ", we have selected the reactions @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first two reactions correspond to classic cases for which there is data available @xcite .",
    "the third reaction involves the scattering of a halo nucleus on a very light target , for which elastic , breakup and transfer have been measured before @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : agsformalism ] we present the ags formalism , and in section  [ sec : differentcdcc ] we outline the different cdcc methodologies we use . in section  [ sec : calculations ] we describe the details of the calculations and in section  [ sec : results ] the results are presented .",

    "the cdcc method @xcite was introduced as an approximate solution to the three - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "its main objective is to provide a reliable yet practical way of describing reactions involving three - body breakup .",
    "let us consider specifically the breakup reaction @xmath74 . in cdcc , the wavefunction is expanded in terms of only one jacobi coordinate set @xmath75 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 are eigenfunctions of the projectile , @xmath78 being a general subscript for projectile bound ( continuum ) states , and @xmath79 the spectator wavefunction for the motion of the projectile relative to the target .",

    "the projectile is modelled by a real potential which produces its initial bound state , whereas the fragment - target interactions should contain absorption from channels not included explicitly in the model ( optical potentials ) . in principle , this is important for the validity of the cdcc method @xcite , since it reduces the coupling to the other three - body channels best described by other jacobi sets taken explicitly into account by the faddeev method .    for practical reasons , the integral over projectile scattering states",
    "is discretized and truncated at a maximum energy .",
    "there are several methods of discretization but here we use the average method , where the @xmath81 scattering radial functions @xmath87 are averaged over @xmath88 to be made square integrable @xcite .",

    "the normalisation constant is defined by @xmath92 .",
    "after a few steps of algebra and using the eigenvalue equation for the projectile @xmath93 , the standard cdcc equation becomes @xmath94 \\psi^{\\bm k}_{p}({\\bm r } ) =   - \\sum_{p ' \\ne p }",

    "the solution of the coupled equations provide the wavefunctions @xmath98 .",
    "the scattering observables ( associated to the elastic and breakup channels ) are extracted from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath98 .",
    "numerical solutions of eq .",
    "( [ cdcc - simple2 ] ) involve partial wave expansions of @xmath99 , @xmath98 and a multipole decomposition of @xmath100 .    in its standard form , cdcc models the breakup of a projectile as inelastic excitation ( cdcc - bu ) .",
    "however , the cdcc wavefunction of eq .   can also be used in the exit channel of a transfer reaction . in that case , the breakup process is understood as a transfer of the fragment to the continuum of the final composite system ( cdcc - tr * ) . in the cdcc - tr * scheme , the scattering observables can be obtained inserting the cdcc wavefunction in the prior form of the transition amplitude : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a distorted wave , generated by the potential @xmath103 . in this work , we chose @xmath104 as the single folding of the core - target and the fragment - target interactions over the projectile s ground state ( the watanabe potential ) .",
    "we notice that , if @xmath105 is the exact solution of the three - body hamiltonian , the transition amplitude ( [ tprior ] ) is exact and does not depend on the choice of the auxiliary potential @xmath106 . in practice , this wavefunction is replaced by an approximate one which , in the tr * approach , corresponds to the cdcc expansion in the final channel .",
    "the transfer to the continuum approach seems to provide a good description of the data in some cases @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed discussion of these two mechanisms is presented along with a comparative study . in principle , and as long as the cdcc model space is sufficiently large , one would expect that different choices of the jacobi coordinate produce the same results . however , in @xcite it is shown that this equivalence does not hold for a number of reaction observables .",

    "we present both , the energy distribution ( fig .  [ be11butrener ] ) and the angular distribution ( fig .",

    "for the energy distribution , two cdcc - bu calculations are shown , one with @xmath246 ( dash - dotted line ) and one with @xmath247 ( thin solid line ) for the @xmath156 motion .",
    "the significant difference between these two calculations suggests that the cdcc - bu calculation is not converged with respect to the number of @xmath156 partial waves .",
    "the calculation with @xmath246 reproduces reasonably well the shape of the energy distribution predicted by the ags calculation , but it underestimates this cross section at the peak by about 20% .",
    "this underestimation could be due to the contribution of higher @xmath156 partial waves or due to some breakdown of cdcc .",
    "the angular distribution is also in good agreement with the exact result for the whole angular range , except at very small angles .",
    "the cdcc - tr * calculation also reproduces reasonably well the energy distribution . for the higher @xmath13 energies , this calculation is however well above the ags result .",
    "moreover , some underestimation of the cross section is observed at the maximum of the distribution , as well as at low @xmath13 energies .",
    "we notice that these energies are associated with configurations in which the @xmath201 system is in a very high excited state , and these states are difficult to include in the cdcc - tr * calculation .",
    "the peak observed in the energy distribution of fig .",
    "[ be11butrener ] corresponds to @xmath117 quasi - free scattering and it is natural that it is best reproduced by cdcc - tr*. note that , as for the cdcc - tr * predictions for the transfer to the ground state , in the cdcc - tr * breakup , the fixed @xmath156 partial - wave independent interaction was used to generate the deuteron continuum .",
    "however in this case the results are not very sensitive to this potential choice .",
    "the cdcc - tr * angular distribution ( dashed line in fig .  [ be11butrangl ] ) reproduces well the faddeev calculation at small angles , but underestimates the cross section for angles beyond 50@xmath248 .",
    "we notice again that small angles are mainly associated with the @xmath249 quasi - free scattering region which is better described in a @xmath201 basis , as it is done in the tr * approach .",
    "conversely , these configurations are difficult to describe in the @xmath156 basis which explains the low convergence rate of the bu calculation at small @xmath13 scattering angles .",

    "we finish this section by noting that , even if the cdcc wavefunction is not appropriate to describe breakup in all regions of phase - space , this wavefunction can be accurate in a limited domain .",
    "for example , in the cdcc - bu calculations presented in this section , the cdcc solution can be a good approximation to the exact three - body wavefunction in the region of space that corresponds to small neutron-@xmath13 separations .",
    "a comparative study of reaction observables calculated within the three - body ags framework and the approximate cdcc equations is presented .",
    "the ags results shown here involve heavier nuclei where optical potentials together with the full treatment of the coulomb interaction are used to describe direct nuclear reactions driven by deuterons and halo nuclei .",
    "we perform calculations for the scattering of deuterons on @xmath7 at @xmath108 and @xmath226 at @xmath110 as well as @xmath6 on protons at @xmath254 and calculate elastic , breakup and transfer observables .",
    "the results indicate that , for reactions involving the elastic scattering and breakup of deuterons on carbon and ni targets , cdcc is in agreement with the full three - body results .",
    "our calculations also reveal that coulomb effects in the breakup of deuteron by @xmath7 are not negligible for proton forward - angle breakup . indeed , the method of screening and renormalization used to treat the coulomb interaction in the ags equations is stretched to its limit of applicability in these regions of phase space characterized by small momentum transfer in the @xmath128 subsystem , a situation never encountered before in @xmath10 @xcite or @xmath11 breakup @xcite .    for the @xmath255be - proton test case , the picture is more complicated . for elastic scattering",
    "the two methods are in good agreement , however still fall short to describe the data . for the transfer cross section , cdcc constructed on the deuteron continuum underestimates the cross section compared to the solution of the ags equations . and finally for the breakup observables , we only find good agreement between cdcc and faddeev in certain regions of phase space , depending strongly on the choice of the basis used for the cdcc expansion .",
    "specifically , in the energy regime dominated by @xmath256 quasi free scattering ( forward @xmath204be angle ) the representation based on the @xmath201 system ( cdcc - tr * ) accounts well for the full three - body effects , whereas for large angles of the detected fragment , corresponding to small excitations of the @xmath257be system , the basis constructed from the @xmath255be continuum ( cdcc - bu ) is more appropriate .",
    "a word of caution is required for the choice of the cdcc basis to be used for given kinematical regimes .",
    "it is also important to note that the rate of convergence of the cdcc observables is very slow , particularly for cdcc - bu .",
    "this may in part explain the disagreement found at some angles and energies of the detected fragments .",
    "the cdcc equations attempt to produce a wavefunction that describes all the three - body effects , from small internal projectile distances to very large ones .",
    "in fact , all cdcc - bu observables are obtained here from the asymptotics of the three - body wavefunction .",
