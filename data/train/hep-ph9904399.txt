    "the question whether neutrinos have non - zero mass has been an outstanding issue in particle physics for many decades .",
    "recently there have been new exciting developments in the indirect search for neutrino masses via neutrino oscillations .",
    "major progress has been achieved by studying atmospheric neutrinos , culminating in the announcement of evidence for muon neutrino oscillations by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite .",
    "the most striking signal presented in @xcite is the up - down asymmetry of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux .",
    "the choice of this particular quantity eliminates many theoretical uncertainties and the final result is very robust . in fact , at present time , this result represents perhaps the best evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "another very active area of research is the study of neutrinos coming from the sun .",
    "ever since the homestake experiment @xcite reported its first results , there has been disagreement between theoretical predictions and measurements of the solar neutrino flux . for many years , however , it was not possible to determine if the observed discrepancy was due to problems with the experiment and/or with the modeling of the sun , or if it was , in fact , a sign of new physics . in the last decade other neutrino experiments , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite , and more recently super - kamiokande @xcite , have also measured the solar neutrino flux , with different energy thresholds and using very different techniques .",
    "all four experiments confirm a deficit in the observed number of solar neutrino induced events .",
    "moreover , it has recently become clear that it is virtually impossible to concoct a solar model which would fit all the data @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of all experiments can be explained by assuming that the electron neutrino oscillates into a different flavor state .",
    "there are two neutrino oscillation scenarios that are capable of faithfully explaining the solar neutrino data @xcite .",
    "one scenario makes use of the msw effect @xcite , where the electron neutrino conversion into another neutrino flavor is due to flavor dependent interactions with solar matter .",
    "the other scenario assumes that the neutrino oscillation length is comparable to the earth - sun distance , and simple vacuum oscillations are sufficient .",
    "this scenario is also known as the `` just - so '' solution @xcite .",
    "both scenarios allow the electron neutrinos to oscillate into other active species or sterile neutrinos",
    ".    the solar neutrino energy spectrum is determined by several nuclear reactions which take place in the sun s core @xcite , and different experiments are sensitive to neutrinos produced by different nuclear reactions .",
    "super - kamiokande , for example , a very large water cherenkov detector , is currently sensitive to solar neutrinos with energies slightly above 5.5  mev .",
    "almost all neutrinos it detects come from the decay of @xmath3b ( @xmath3b @xmath4 @xmath3be@xmath5).he @xmath6he @xmath7 . ]",
    "another solar reaction that gives rise to neutrinos is the process of electron capture by a @xmath1be nucleus ( @xmath1be @xmath8 @xmath1li @xmath9 ) .",
    "neutrinos from this reaction have energies below the super - kamiokande threshold , but are accessible to the radiochemical experiments homestake , gallex , and sage . if one naively assumes that the suppression in the neutrino flux is due to the suppression of individual neutrino sources ( @xmath3b , @xmath1be , etc ) in the sun , the combination of the super - kamiokande data with that of the radiochemical experiments indicates that the flux of @xmath1be neutrinos is virtually absent @xcite ( the best fit value of the @xmath1be flux is in fact negative ! ) . in the case of neutrino oscillations , all solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle",
    "indicate that the @xmath1be neutrino flux is suppressed , in some cases very strongly .",
    "thus , at present , there is great demand for experiments that would accurately measure the flux of the @xmath1be neutrinos .",
    "two upcoming experiments , borexino and kamland , may have the capability to do exactly that .    in this paper , we present a quantitative study of what can be accomplished by measuring the seasonal variations of the @xmath1be neutrino flux at borexino and kamland . seasonal variations of the solar neutrino flux are of course expected , due to the earth s eccentric orbit .",
    "the number of neutrinos of all flavors reaching the earth is larger when the earth is closer to the sun than when it is farther away , and should vary as @xmath10 . in the case of no neutrino oscillations or of the msw solution to the solar neutrino puzzle ,",
    "the number of @xmath1be solar neutrino induced events is supposed to vary according to the @xmath10 law , following the variation of the total neutrino flux .",
    "this will be referred to as the `` normal '' seasonal variation .",
    "if vacuum oscillations are the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , large , anomalous seasonal variations of the number of @xmath1be solar neutrino induced events might be detected @xcite .",
    "it is well known that neutrino oscillation effects depend on the distance to the neutrino source , and different earth - sun distances may yield very different @xmath11 survival probabilities @xcite .",
    "the anomalous seasonal variation effect should be more pronounced in @xmath1be neutrinos than in @xmath3b neutrinos ( the latter was recently studied in @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to one important feature which distinguishes @xmath1be neutrinos from @xmath3b and other abundant types of solar neutrinos : because they are produced as part of a two - body final state , the neutrino energy spectrum is mono-energetic.li nucleus .",
    "borexino and kamland are only sensitive to the higher energy component . ]",
    "the details will become clear when we discuss the anomalous seasonal variation effect , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] .    in the case of no anomalous seasonal variations ,",
    "if one has enough statistics and a small enough background , the time variation of the data can be used to measure the solar neutrino flux , given that the number of background events is constant in time .",
    "we will analyze how well borexino and kamland can perform this type of measurement .",
    "we are particularly interested in analyzing the relevance of this technique when the number of electron neutrinos reaching the detector is very suppressed with respect to the standard solar model predictions , as might be the case if there are @xmath12 oscillations for the small angle msw solution .",

    "[ sec : flux ] we discuss how seasonal variations might be used to determine the solar neutrino flux at borexino and kamland , in such a way that no separate measurement of the number of background events is required . in sec .",

    "in particular we describe the region of the ( @xmath15 ) parameter space where vacuum oscillations can be discovered by studying the seasonal variations of the data . in secs .",
    "[ sec : measurement ] and [ sec : exclusion ] we describe how the measurement of the seasonal variation of the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux may be used to either measure the neutrino oscillation parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or exclude a large portion of the ( @xmath15 ) parameter space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results and conclude .",
    "as was already pointed out , measuring the flux of @xmath1be neutrinos is crucial towards understanding the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "borexino @xcite plans to do this measurement by using 300 tons of organic liquid scintillator to detect recoil electrons from elastic @xmath18-@xmath14 scattering . since the scintillator has no directional information , and the signal is characterized only by the scintillation light produced by the recoil electron , the background has to be kept under control .",
    "this places a very stringent constraint on the radio - purity of the scintillator and on the activity of the material in the detector .",
    "borexino anticipates 100 tons of fiducial volume for detecting solar neutrinos .",
    "kamland @xcite , which was originally conceived as a reactor neutrino experiment with an unprecedented baseline ( 170  km on the average ) , may also be able to study @xmath1be solar neutrinos , if rigorous yet attainable requirements on the radio - purity and activity are met .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that kamland will use 600 tons of fiducial volume for detecting solar neutrinos ( the size of the fiducial volume will depend on the background rate , which is currently unknown ) .",
    "we concentrate our analysis on borexino , which is an approved dedicated solar neutrino experiment , and discuss kamland , whose uses for solar neutrino studies are at present being proposed @xcite , as a possible higher statistics improvement .    it is important to define what is meant by `` measuring the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux . '' in reality , what the experiments are capable of measuring is the number of recoil electrons induced by solar neutrino interactions in a given recoil electron kinetic energy range ( kinematic range ) .",
    "this information can only be converted into a solar neutrino flux measurement if one knows the flavor composition of the solar neutrinos @xcite .",

    "explicitly , @xmath33 clearly , if @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to remember that @xmath36 and therefore @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio of the neutrino elastic cross sections depends on the energy of the incoming neutrino and the kinematic range to which each particular experiment is sensitive . for @xmath38  mev and the borexino ( kamland ) kinematic range 250800  kev ( 280800  kev ) , @xmath39 .",
    "it is this effective electron neutrino flux , @xmath32 , that is referred to , throughout this paper ( and in general ) , as the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux .    in order to determine the number of recoil electrons induced by solar neutrino interactions , it is crucial to determine the number of background events .",
    "the number of background events can be estimated by various techniques , which we do not address in this paper .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out , however , that this is a very difficult process and it would be highly desirable to have an independent way to determine the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux in order to make the final results more convincing .",
    "this may be possible if one looks at the seasonal variation of the number of detected events .    in the following",
    ", we study the seasonal variation of the event rate as a means to measure the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux .",
    "the distance between the earth and the sun varies slightly over seasons because of the eccentricity of the earth s orbit .",
    "( when the earth is closest to the sun ) occurs around january first .",
    "the eccentricity of the earth s orbit is @xmath40 , and hence the distance varies as @xmath41 to the first order in @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 is the time measured in years from the perihelion , and @xmath44  km is one astronomical unit .",
    "the neutrino flux varies as @xmath10 and hence shows a seasonal variation of about 7% from minimum to maximum .",
    "the change in the earth - sun distance between the aphelion and the perihelion is given by @xmath45 by fitting the event rate to the seasonal variation expected due to the eccentricity , @xmath46 one can extract the background event rate @xmath47 and the signal event rate @xmath48 independently .",
    "as long as the detector is monitored well and its performance is sufficiently stable , this method will be only limited by statistics .",
    "borexino expects 53 events / daybe electron capture throughout the paper .",
    "in particular we neglect the contribution of neutrinos produced in the cno cycle , which is about 10% of that from the @xmath1be neutrinos . ]",
    "according to the bp95 @xcite standard solar model ( ssm ) , together with 19 background events / day @xcite , after the statistical subtraction of the known background sources .",
    "this is done by pulse shape discrimination against the @xmath49-particle background and the measurement of bi - po pairs via @xmath49-@xmath50 coincidence .",
    "this in turn allows the statistical subtraction of processes in the @xmath51u and @xmath52th chains which are in equilibrium .",
    "it is also assumed that the experiment can achieve a radio - purity of @xmath53g / g for u / th , @xmath54g / g for @xmath55k , @xmath56 , and no rn diffusion .",
    "for kamland we use 466 events / kt / day for the signal and 217 events / kt / day @xcite for the background under similar assumptions but with larger cosmogenic background ( especially @xmath57c ) and some rn diffusion .",
    "assuming 600  t of fiducial volume , we expect 280 signal events / day and 130 background events / day . throughout the paper",
    ", we will assume that the number of background events is either constant in time or its time dependence is sufficiently well understood by monitoring .",
    "we neglect systematic effects and assume that there are only statistical uncertainties .    under these assumptions , fig .",

    "the important information one should obtain from this analysis is if one can indeed measure a nonzero @xmath1be solar neutrino flux .",
    "for example , in the case of the small angle msw solution , the @xmath11 survival probability is very close to zero and , assuming the expected number of background events , borexino s measured neutrino flux is less than 1.5  @xmath60 away from zero .",
    "the situation at kamland is much better , and in the case of the small angle msw solution a healthy 3 sigma - away - from - zero measurement of the flux is obtained , if the background is as low as expected .",
    "the significance of the measured flux increases for larger survival probabilities , as in the case of the large angle and the low @xmath61 msw solutions .    a similar analysis can be performed in order to determine how many background events each experiment can tolerate in order to claim a solar neutrino flux measurement which is 3  @xmath60 away from zero . fig .",
    "[ max_bkg ] depicts the maximum number of background events per day allowed for 3 years of borexino or kamland running .",

    "moreover , as we will show in this section , both borexino and kamland will be able to cover a large portion of the `` just - so '' parameter space , even without relying on a particular solar model or estimate of the background rate , just by analyzing the _ shape _ of their data . in this sense",
    "the discovery of an anomalous seasonal variation at one of these experiments would be as robust a result as the super - kamiokande measurement of the up - down asymmetry for the atmospheric muon neutrinos .    to illustrate the main idea , we choose a particular point ( @xmath75  ev@xmath67 , @xmath76 ) in the allowed region of the `` just - so '' parameter space and compute the corresponding seasonal distribution of the neutrino events at borexino after 3 years of running .",

    "it is intuitively obvious from the figure that the vacuum oscillation `` data '' points can not be fit by the `` theoretical '' curve even if the background and the solar neutrino flux are varied freely , unless one assumes neutrino oscillations .",

    ", several issues must be confronted .",
    "we will next address these issues one by one , and illustrate the discussion in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnwdthandcore ] .",
    "the first and the most obvious point is that the number of bins needs to be changed .",
    "the reason is that the frequency of the seasonal variations increases with @xmath61 , and above some value ( @xmath108  ev@xmath67 , for 12 bins ) integration over the bin size washes out the effect . to avoid this",
    ", we change the number of bins from 12 to 365 . after the change , the effect of binning kicks in at @xmath109  ev@xmath67 , as curve 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnwdthandcore ] illustrates .",
    "next , there are two physical effects one must take into account : one is the interaction of the neutrinos with solar matter ( the msw effect ) , and the other is the finite width of the @xmath1be solar neutrino line .",
    "one may worry about the wash - out of the seasonal variation effect due to the finite size of sun s core .",
    "however , matter effects make the core size effect irrelevant because the mixing angle in the sun s core is small and the oscillations effectively start at the level - crossing point ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : arrival ] ) ) .",
    "when a @xmath11 is created by the electron capture process in the core of the sun , its hamiltonian is dominated by the matter effect @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is the electron number density ) if @xmath112 for @xmath1be neutrinos .",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath113  ev@xmath67 in the following discussions , as the final sensitivity due to the anomalous seasonal variation is limited by @xmath114  ev@xmath67 as will be seen later in this section .",
    "then the mass mixing effect can be completely ignored at the time of the neutrino production , and one can safely take the produced neutrino to be in a hamiltonian eigenstate ( the one which corresponds to the larger energy in the sun s core ) . as it propagates through the sun",
    ", the neutrino follows the instantaneous hamiltonian eigenstate ( in the adiabatic approximation ) , and exits in the heavier mass eigenstate , @xmath115 .",
    "it also has a finite amplitude @xmath116 for hopping to the other hamiltonian eigenstate .",
    "the neutrino state that exits the sun can therefore be written as @xmath117 with the unitarity constraint @xmath118 . out of the sun ,",
    "the two mass eigenstates develop different phases due to the mass difference , @xmath119 .",
    "therefore the neutrino state that arrives at the earth is given by @xmath120 up to an overall phase factor .",

    "the second effect is the finite width of the @xmath1be line . to give some preliminary idea about the relative size of this effect , we first consider a simplified model .",
    "we assume for a moment that the only source of the line broadening is the doppler shift of neutrino energies arising from the thermal motion of the @xmath1be nuclei .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the sensitivity to anomalous seasonal variations is completely lost for @xmath154  ev@xmath67 . in this case",

    "the fit is performed by minimizing @xmath80 with respect to the incoming neutrino flux ( @xmath79 ) and the background rate ( @xmath78 ) , as in sec .",

    "one should easily note that the extracted 95% cl contour for the high point consists of only two `` islands '' , while for the low point one extracts a collection of `` islands '' .",
    "the reason for this is simple .",
    "when @xmath161",
    "ev@xmath67 , the oscillation length is slightly smaller than @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ deltal ] ) ) .",
    "this means that the seasonal variation of the `` data '' has a very particular shape ( as one may easily confirm by looking at figs .",
    "[ fig : illustratepoint ] , [ points ] ) , which can not be easily mimicked by other values of @xmath61 , even when the background rate and the incoming flux are varied in the fit procedure .",
    "when @xmath162  ev@xmath67 , the oscillation length is larger than @xmath74 , and the effect of seasonal variations is less pronounced .",
    "there is a collection of @xmath61 s that yields the same qualitative behavior . because our fit procedure allows for the background rate and the neutrino flux to float freely , a good agreement with the `` data ''",
    "is met for a large portion of the parameter space . in order to make this discussion clearer ,",
    "it is useful to describe in detail what happens to the number of electron neutrinos reaching the detector as a function of time .    in the case of the low point : initially , when the earth is at the perihelion , the @xmath11 survival probability is small and , as time progresses , monotonically increases until the earth reaches the aphelion ( after six months ) .",
    "the process happens in reverse order in the next six months , as expected .",
    "there are many other values of the oscillation length , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 , such that the survival probability monotonically increases for increasing earth - sun distance and therefore a similar qualitative behavior is to be expected .",
    "the main quantitative difference is in the ratio of the number of events detected in the perihelion and in the aphelion , which may be accounted for by varying the background rate and the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "this explains the existence of islands . for values of @xmath61 in between islands , the survival probability either increases _ and _ decreases for varying earth - sun distance , or monotonically _",
    "decreases_. the exact location of the islands and their widths can only be understood by analyzing the fit procedure , in particular the minimization of @xmath80 with respect to the background rate and the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "note that there are no `` islands '' above @xmath163  ev@xmath67 .",
    "this is because when the oscillation length is small enough ( or @xmath61 large enough ) , the survival probability _ can not _ only increase for increasing earth - sun distance , but necessarily reaches a maximum before the aphelion , and then decreases , independent of what the survival probability at the perihelion is .",
    "this situation is qualitatively different from the low point .    in the case of the high point :",
    "initially the survival probability is close to unity , decreases sharply as the earth moves further from the sun , and then grows rapidly , reaching a maximum when the earth is close to its aphelion , because the oscillation length is smaller than @xmath74 . in this case ,",
    "little variations in the oscillation length , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 , produce big qualitative changes , including the position and number of maxima and minima .",
    "there is still a small ambiguity ( _ i.e. _ two `` islands '' ) in determining @xmath61 for the high point .",
    "this happens when the oscillation length is such that the minimum of the survival probability happens in march / october and the survival probability is large enough at the perihelion and the aphelion .",

    "[ sec : sensitivity ] , especially in the region @xmath167  ev@xmath67 .",
    "this is due to the fact that a large number of points in the parameter space yield an annual variation of the @xmath11 flux which is much larger than 7% , but agrees with the shape of the normal seasonal variation . if in the fit procedure the signal is scaled down to reduce the amplitude of the variation and the background scaled up to increase the number of events , a good fit to the no oscillation case can be attained .",

    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , one notices that the kamland exclusion region is larger than the one excluded by borexino .",
    "this is , of course , expected because of kamland s larger fiducial volume and therefore higher statistics .",
    "second , when the solar neutrino flux is allowed to vary in the fit , the excluded region of the parameter space shrinks , as expected and discussed earlier .",
    "third , one can safely claim that , if no discrepancies are detected in the seasonal variation spectrum , the `` large '' @xmath61 ( several @xmath169  ev@xmath67 ) set of vacuum solutions ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : finalborexino ] and [ fig : finalkamland ] ) will be excluded , even at borexino . even when no knowledge of the incoming neutrino flux is used , a reasonable portion of the `` small '' @xmath61 ( several",
    "@xmath170  ev@xmath67 ) set of solutions is also excluded .",
    "when one assumes knowledge of the incoming neutrino flux , the entire allowed region is excluded .",
    "if the background rate is larger than expected , the excluded region diminishes accordingly .",
    "this is because when the constant background is enhanced with respect to the oscillation signal it is easier to achieve a reasonable @xmath80 for the fit even when the seasonal variations due to vacuum oscillations are significantly different from the no - oscillation case . in particular ,",
    "when the background rate is large enough that the seasonal distribution of the data is statistically consistent with a flat one , a reasonable @xmath80 for the fit can always be achieved simply by scaling the signal to zero and scaling up the background appropriately .",
    "explicitly , after three years of borexino ( kamland ) running the exclusion region vanishes if the background rate is @xmath1718 ( 40 ) times larger than anticipated , when both the background rate and the incoming neutrino flux are allowed to float in the fit or @xmath171500 ( 3000 ) times larger than anticipated when one assumes the neutrino flux predicted by the ssm .      if there is an overall , _",
    "i.e. _ , time - independent suppression of the flux ( which is the case for the msw solutions ) , the way to proceed towards excluding part of the vacuum oscillation parameter space is less clear .",
    "this is because such an experimental result neither agrees with the ssm prediction nor does it represent any `` smoking gun '' signature for neutrino oscillations , as is the case of anomalous seasonal variations .",
    "one does not know if the ssm prediction of the flux is simply wrong , or if there are neutrino oscillations consistent with one of the msw solutions or both .",
    "anyway , it is clear that ( in general ) the incoming neutrino flux should be considered unknown in the data analysis .",
    "the most conservative option is to follow the same analysis done in the previous subsection , and allow both the incoming neutrino flux and the background rate to float in the fit . in this case , the excluded region of the two - neutrino oscillation parameter space is reduced significantly , and may completely disappear .",
    "this is because when the number of signal events is reduced the annual distribution is closer to flat and a good fit is obtained even when the would - be annual variations are very different .",
    "this is very similar to what was previously discussed at the end of the last subsection , where we discussed what happens if the background rate turns out to be much larger than anticipated .",
    "explicitly , after three years of borexino running and a signal rate which is 21.3% of the ssm prediction ( as one would obtain in the case of the small angle msw solution ) , borexino is unable to exclude any portion of the vacuum oscillation parameter space , while kamland can still exclude about one half of the `` high '' and `` low '' @xmath61 preferred regions .",
    "if the background rate can be estimated by other means with 10% uncertainty , borexino and kamland will be able to exclude the entire``high '' @xmath61 region and a significant portion of the `` low '' @xmath61 region .    in order to go beyond the most conservative analysis",
    "discussed above , one would have to look at the overall situation of the solar neutrino puzzle at the time of the data analysis .",
    "it is likely that one will be able to do much better .",
    "for example , solar neutrino oscillations might have already been established by the sno experiment @xcite , and perhaps it is reasonable to assume the incoming solar neutrino flux predicted by the ssm",
    ". then it would be possible to exclude a region of the parameter space as large as the one in sec .",
    "[ subsec : consistent ] where one assumes the ssm flux .",
    "another possibility is that super - kamiokande or sno rules out the small angle msw solution by studying the distortions of the electron energy spectrum @xcite , and a large suppression of the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux would indicate that there is something wrong with the ssm . in this case , it is not clear how to proceed .",
    "we do not go into further discussions on all logical possibilities .",
    "we have studied possible uses of the seasonal variation of the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux at borexino and kamland .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "once the experiments accumulate enough data to see seasonal variations , the first step will be to determine if the observed pattern is consistent with the normal @xmath10 flux suppression .",
    "if a discrepancy is found , it will be a sign of vacuum oscillations . in this case",
    ", the seasonal variation of the data can be used to determine the oscillation parameters @xmath16 and @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the data are consistent with the normal pattern , the amplitude of the variation can be used to measure the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux and to exclude a significant portion of the vacuum oscillation parameter space .",
    "if the observed seasonal variations are consistent with the normal @xmath10 flux suppression , one can use the amplitude of the variation to determine what fraction of the observed recoil electrons are induced by the neutrinos coming from the sun .",
    "this method is limited by statistics , and the accuracy is worse when the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux is suppressed , as in the case of the small angle msw solution .",
    "in fact , in sec .  [",
    "sec : flux ] we found that in the case of a large suppression only kamland should be able to perform such a measurement , after 3 years of data taking .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we assumed the oscillation of electron neutrinos into other active flavors . in the case of oscillations into sterile neutrinos",
    ", the @xmath1be solar neutrino flux might be almost absent , and in this case neither borexino nor kamland are able to perform a measurement of the flux using this technique .",
    "an important advantage of this technique is that it does not require a separate estimate of the background rate , which may be a very difficult task .",
    "if the background rate can be reliably measured by some other means , one can obtain another measurement of the neutrino flux . in this case , the two results can then be compared for consistency , thus making the final result on the @xmath166be neutrino flux much more trustworthy",

    "our analysis shows that the outlook for discovering vacuum oscillations at both borexino and kamland is very favorable . a very important finding in sec .",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] is that the experiments may detect a deviation from the normal pattern of seasonal variations even without relying on the ssm prediction of the incoming neutrino flux or estimate of the background rate .",

    "the sensitivity region should be larger at kamland ( fig .",

    "[ sec : exclusion ] we presented the exclusion plots for both borexino and kamland , after three years of running . an important lesson from that section is that in order to exclude a large portion of the preferred region , the experiments will need to either measure the background rate or rely on the ssm prediction for the neutrino flux . in the absence of both , the results are rather weak .",
