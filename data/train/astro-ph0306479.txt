    "the dust found in young , massive circumstellar disks around ttauri and herbig ae / be stars consists mainly of two distinct species : a silicate component and a carbonaceous component ( savage & mathis  1979 , draine & lee  1984 ; malfait et al .",

    "in contrast to the situation for young optically thick disks , older optically thin debris disks are expected to allow a more detailed investigation of dust grain parameters , in particular the chemical components and the grain sizes .",
    "an important caveat to this claim of simpler modelling for debris disks is that because the dust dynamics are determined by a combination of radiation pressure , the poynting - robertson effect , and the ( possible ) production of dust due to collision processes and gravitational interaction with possibly embedded planets , the disk density distribution may be dictated by several additional parameters , the influence of which on the dust reemission / scattered light sed will be discussed in detail in sect .",

    "( 1999 ) , bouwman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and meeus et al .",
    "however , the seds of debris disks measured so far do not allow one to perform a comparably detailed chemical analysis ; sirtf is expected to be revolutionary in this regard .",
    "we consider the dust grains to be homogeneous spheres .",
    "although dust grains are expected to have a fractal structure , the scattering behaviour is similar to that of spheres ( see lumme & rahola  1994 for porous dust particle light scattering ) .",
    "furthermore , dust grains are expected to have a non - spherical shape ( see , e.g. , elvius & hall  1967 ; scarrott , draper , & warren - smith  1989 ; hajjar & bastien  1996 ; kastner & weintraub  1996 ; dollfus & suchail  1987 ; johnson & jones  1991 ; chrysostomou et al .  2000 ) .",
    "however , we do not consider the grains to be aligned on a large scale by magnetic fields and thus , the assumption of spherical grains is a valid approximation ( wolf , voshchinnikov , & henning  2002 ) .",
    "the optical parameters of the grains required for the estimation of the dust absorption , reemission and scattering , are derived from the complex refractive index @xmath44 and the grain radius .",

    "furthermore , we compare selected dust properties with the optical properties of `` astronomical silicate '' and graphite provided by weingartner & draine  ( 2001 ; see also draine & lee  1984 ) since these data are used in a large variety of simulations of circumstellar dust configurations . according to eqs .",

    "pantin , lagage , & artymowicz  ( 1997 ) find amorphous olivine ( mgfesio@xmath46 ) to be the dominant chemical dust component in the @xmath3  pic disk ( 55% amorphous olivine , 35% amorphous pyroxene , and 10% crystalline olivine ) .",
    "in contrast to this , molster , waters , & tielens  ( 2002a , b ) find narrow - band emission features in the sed of dust around evolved stars , clearly pointing to the existence of crystalline silicates . in order to cover this large range of different silicates",
    ", we investigate the main differences between a number of different amorphous pyroxene species ( mg@xmath47fe@xmath48sio@xmath12 with @xmath49=0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.95 and 1.0 ) , and amorphous olivine species ( mg@xmath50fe@xmath51sio@xmath46 with @xmath49=0.4 and 0.5 ) .",
    "the efficiency factors for 1@xmath2 m grains are shown in fig .",
    "[ si - reihe - q ] .",
    "despite the characteristic 10@xmath2 m and 19@xmath2 m maxima of the absorption efficiency , the most significant property is the strong dependence of the ultraviolet ( uv ) to near - infrared ( nir ) absorption efficiency on the fe content ( see jger et al .",
    "1994 for a detailed compilation and discussion of absorption bands of amorphous pyroxene ) . with increasing relative fe content the absorption efficiency increases by about three orders of magnitude in the case of a micron - sized grain in this wavelength range from fe - deficient mgsio@xmath12 to fe - rich mg@xmath52fe@xmath53sio@xmath46 .",
    "thus , the temperature and reemitted flux of the grains at a given radial distance from the star increases .",
    "these effects are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ si - reihe - sed ] where the resulting density distribution for our standard disk model ( see below ) is shown . furthermore ,",
    "the comparison with `` astronomical silicate '' ( weingartner & draine  2001 ) shows that it is much more similar to fe - rich than to fe - poor silicates . for comparison , the scattering / reemission sed of crystalline olivine ( mgfesio@xmath46 ) is shown .",
    "similar to fe - poor silicates , crystalline olivine has a very low absorption efficieny in the wavelength range of stellar emission ( see fig .",
    "[ scaabs-5 ] ) and can therefore only be traced ( by its pronounced numerous narrow emission features ) either based on highly accurate photometric measurements or if a high relative amount of this material is present in the disk .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the efficieny factors on the grain size is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ scaabs-1 ] , [ scaabs-2 ] , and [ scaabs-5 ] for fe - deficient and fe - rich amorphous silicate and crystalline olivine .    *",
    "carbon : * it is commonly assumed that the carbonaceous dust component occurs in the form of graphite ( see , e.g. , draine & lee  1984 , li & greenberg  1997 , weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast to this common assumption , the dust emissivity described by a power - law with a spectral index of @xmath54 ( campbell et al .",
    "1976 ; sopka et al .",
    "1985 ; martin & rogers  1987 ; grtler , kmpe , & henning  1996 ) can be explained by the occurence of very disordered two - dimensional material like amorphous carbon ( kittel  1963 ) .",
    "jger , mutschke , & henning  ( 1998 ) synthesized structurally different carbon material with an increasing sp@xmath0/sp@xmath1 ratio by pyrolizing cellulose materials at 400 - 1000@xmath55c .",
    "the different carbon structures therefore represent different graphite ( sp@xmath0 hybridization ) to diamond structure ( sp@xmath1 hybridization ) abundance ratios . in fig .",
    "[ scaabs-3 ] and [ scaabs-4 ] we show the efficiency factors calculated for the two extreme cases : the 400k carbon modification ( graphite - poor ) and 1000k carbon modification ( graphite - rich ) .",
    "as these figures show , carbon has a high absorption efficiency in the uv / visual wavelength range , but - in contrast to silicate species - no prominent absorption features ( see also fig .  [ si - reihe - sed ] ) .",
    "thus , it mainly adds a strong continuum to the sed .",
    "the absorption efficiency in the uv / visual wavelength range is comparable to fe - rich silicates .",
    "with increasing sublimation temperature the range of almost constant , high absorption efficiency is extended towards longer wavelengths .",
    "the particular turn - over point beyond which the absorption drops continiously , increases as the grain size is increased .",
    "it is noteworthy that the absorption efficiency of graphite as published by weingartner & draine  ( 2001 ) is smaller than that of the other carbon configurations in the mid - infrared wavelength range .",
    "finally , we illustrate the importance of scattering of stellar radiation by the dust in the case of iron - deficient and iron - rich silicate ( see fig .",
    "[ scattlight ] ) . mainly determined by the solar - type sed of the star ,",
    "the contribution of scattering to the resulting sed is negligible beyond @xmath56 m . at shorter wavelengths , however , the lower absorption efficiency in the case of an iron - deficient silicate results in a larger relative constribution of the scattered light , while the iron - rich amorphous olivine dust reemission dominates at wavelengths of a few microns .",
    "thus , if iron - poor silicates or crystalline olivine are the dominating dust species , spectral features of the star will be present in the near- to mid - infrared wavelength range even after correct substraction of the stellar sed ( e.g. , resulting from independent stellar models ) .",
    "in this section we explore the parameter space allowed by our adopted analytic disk model .",
    "we are strongly guided by observations and theoretical constraints in considering viable values for the disk density distribution , inner and outer disk radius , and the grain size distribution .",
    "based on hydrostatic models , the radial density distribution in ttauri disks is proposed to be in the range @xmath57 ( see , e.g. , kenyon & hartmann  1987 , dalessio et al .  1999 , chiang & goldreich  1997 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of the near - infrared - to - millimeter appearance of several spatially resolved ttauri disks has confirmed these predictions ( see , e.g. , burrows et al .  1996 ; stapelfeldt et al .",

    "2001 ; wood et al .  2002 ; wolf et al .",
    "optically thin debris disks which - in contrast to ttauri disks - are not dominated by gas , are assumed to cover this range of radial density profiles as well but also to manifest values outside of this range .    in the most simple model of debris disks ,",
    "structure is dominated exclusively by gravitation , radiation pressure , and poynting - robertson drag . in a collisionless system without sources or sinks and grains in circular orbits ,",
    "the exponent @xmath58 amounts to 1 ( see , e.g. , briggs  1962 ) .",
    "this `` classical solution '' approximately represents the overall distribution of dust in the solar system ( see , e.g. , ishimoto  2000 ) .",
    "however , as for instance gorkavyi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) pointed out , there exist several effects that may change this distribution remarkably , including resonance effects with planets , gravitational encounters with planets which occur in the form of elastic gravitational scattering , mutual collisions of particles , evaporation of dust grains , and existence of sources of dust with highly eccentric orbits ( such as the encke comet in the case of the solar system ; ( see , e.g. , whipple  1976 , sykes  1988 , epifani et al .",
    "the resulting density distribution is in most cases no longer described by a single power - law as stated in eq .",
    "[ eq_radprof ] , but depends strongly on the properties ( mainly the orbits and masses of planets and dust sources ) of each particular disk / planetary system .",

    "observed seds of selected disks around ttauri and debris - type disks have been found to show hints of inner cavities such that the inner radius of the disk is apparently much larger than the sublimation radius of possible dust species .",

    "1993 , rice et al .",
    "2003 ) and tw  hya ( calvet et al .",

    "taking into account the physical processes responsible for the spatial dust density distribution in debris disks , scattering of particles by massive planets is assumed to be the major effect in explaining these large inner holes : dust grains drifting inwards due to the poynting - robertson effect are likely to be scattered into larger orbits resulting in a lower dust number density within the planet s orbit .",
    "based on the assumed cavity sizes of the debris disks quoted above ( relative to the total sizes of these disks ) , we consider the following cases : 0.1au , 1.0au , and 10au and compare the resulting sed to the case of a disk without any gap , that is , extending inward to the dust sublimation radius .",
    "clearing the inner disk results in a loss of warm dust which is mainly responsible for the near / mid - infrared shape of the sed . with increasing gap size",
    "the minimum value of the mid - infrared flux becomes smaller and is shifted towards longer wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "[ innergap ] ) . because of the higher temperature and therefore more significant contribution to the near / mid - infrared spectrum by small grains , the decrease of the flux in this wavelength range is more pronounced when the relative number of small grains in the system goes up . keeping the disk mass constant ,",
    "the flux in the millimeter region ( not accessible by _ sirtf _ ) increases slightly , but the net flux is smaller compared to a disk without an inner gap .",
    "this is because the fraction of the stellar flux absorbed by a single dust grain decreases with increasing radial distance from the star ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_dist2 ] ) . applying the same explanation to the scattering cross section",
    "( see eq .",
    "[ eq_scatt ] ) , the slight decrease of the scattered stellar light with increasing gap size can be explained by analogy .",

    "greaves , mannings , & holland  2000b ; holland et al .",

[ sidi ] ) , while larger grains with radii of several tens of micron and larger can be more efficiently found by ( sub)millimeter measurements .",
    "one has to take into account that the abundance and spatial distribution of the small grain component , especially the one with @xmath61 ( see eq .  [ eq_beta ] ) , depends on the location of dust sources and the likelihood of collisional events .",
    "since these parameters are not necessarily correlated with the actual disk size , submillimeter / millimeter measurements are required to trace larger grains which are less affected by the radiation pressure and poynting - robertson effect .",
    "the question to be answered here is whether there are significant differences in the sed resulting from different disk sizes .    as result of our simulations , fig .",
    "[ rou ] shows the sed for disks with outer radii between 25 and 400au .",
    "the influence on the near / mid - infrared wavelength range is seen only as a decrease of the net flux with increasing disk size which is due to the decrease of the mean temperature of the disk . at several tens of microns and beyond 100@xmath2 m also the shape of the sed",
    "is affected because the smaller mean temperature results in an increase of the ( sub)millimeter  to - near / mid - infrared flux ratio .      in this section",
    "we consider dust models with a grain size distribution which is characterized by a ( minimal ) set of three parameters : the minimum and maximum grain radius ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) and a power - law exponent @xmath64 of the size distribution : @xmath65 since debris disks are assumed to be a place of continuous dust production due to collisional processes between larger particles ( rather than being nurtured from a hostile interstellar medium - see , e.g. , artymowicz & clampin  1997 ) , all three parameters depend on the particular debris disk system .",
    "in contrast to the interstellar medium or disks around very young stellar objects , all three parameters may therefore vary in a wide range even between different radial zones within one and the same disk ( gorkavyi et al .",
    "furthermore , the collision rate is assumed to decrease as the disk ages since the fraction of disk material present in larger bodies increases with time ( see , e.g. , kokubo & ida  2002 ) .",
    "this might allow us to classify debris disks based on their grain size distribution , at least on a statistical basis .",
    "_ constraints on the minimum grain size _",
    "@xmath62 : the smallest grain size expected to be present is determined on the one hand by the likelihood of collisional processes in the disk , and on the other hand by the optical properties of the dust and the strength of the stellar radiation field .",
    "if no collisions are occuring , the minimum grain size can be estimated from the ratio of the radiation pressure to gravity , also known as @xmath3 , ( burns et al .",
    "1979 ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the central stellar luminosity / mass , @xmath68 is the gravitational constant , @xmath69 is the speed of light , @xmath70 is the material density of the grain , and @xmath71 is the radiation pressure coefficient averaged over the entire stellar spectrum . those grains for which @xmath72 are `` blown away '' by radiation pressure on a timescale much shorter than the age of the star ( e.g. , aumann et al .  1984 )",
    "mid - infrared observations of the @xmath3  pic disk by weinberger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that there must exist a substantial amount of grains with radii @xmath73 m within 20au , while pantin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) even constrain the minimum grain size to be as small as @xmath74 m . in case of fomalhaut s debris disk , wyatt & dent  ( 2002 )",
    "derive a minimum grain size of @xmath75 m from submillimeter observations . in our parameter study",
    "we consider @xmath62 = 0.1@xmath2 m and 10@xmath2 m since having the bulk of the mass in larger grains does not produce a substantial mid - infrared contribution to the sed .",
    "_ constraints on the maximum grain size _",
    "@xmath63 : the upper grain size is a very uncertain parameter since debris disks are expected to harbour dust `` particles '' ranging from ( sub)micron - sized grains to planetesimals / planets as the result of an ( almost ) finished process of dust grain growth , planetesimal formation , and simultaneous dust production due to collision events ( see , e.g. , beckwith , henning , & nakagawa  2000 ) . however , according to the wavelength range considered , grains larger than @xmath54 mm will not give a remarkable contribution to the sed .",
    "the existence of these grains can therefore not be proven or ruled out by _ sirtf _  measurements .",
    "complementary ground - based ( sub)millimeter observations can in principal increase this upper grain size limit by about one order of magnitude . based on previous observations of the very limited number of debris disks only very weak constraints on upper grain sizes could be derived .",
    "paresce & burrows ( 1987 ) , for example , found an absence of significant colour excess in visible observations at the outer part of the @xmath3  pic disk , which implies that the dominant particles for the scattering are larger than a few @xmath2 m .",
    "furthermore , observations of main - sequence and pre - main - sequence ( post - herbig ae / be , post - t  tauri ) stars show that the distribution is broad and extends from below 1@xmath2 m to at least @xmath761 mm ( see , e.g. , skinner , barlow , & justtanont  1992 ; sylvester et al .  1996 ; sylvester & skinner  1996 ; li & greenberg  1998 ) . in our parameter study",
    "we consider @xmath63 = 0.1 mm , 1 mm , and 10 mm .",
    "_ constraints on the grain size distribution exponent _ @xmath64 : the equilibrium size distribution resulting from a collisional cascade can be described by a power - law ( eq .  [ eq_grsi ] ) with the exponent @xmath77 ( dohnanyi  1969 ) .",
    "furthermore , tanaka , inaba , & nakazawa  1996 could show that @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) describes the case of a self - similar ( and therefore infinite ) collisional cascade .",
    "wyatt & dent  ( 2002 ) find in fact a very good agreement of the dust sed from fomalhaut s debris disk with the assumption of @xmath79 ( see also holland et al .",
    "however , in general , real dust particle / planetesimal ensembles are expected to be characterized by size - dependent particle strengths , therefore resulting in a distribution of exponents @xmath64 as a function of grain size .",
    "the `` mean '' size distribution exponent could then be slightly shifted from 3.499 ( durda & dermott  1997 ) .",
    "for example , patin et al .  (",
    "1997 ) derived two different exponents to fit mid - infrared images of the @xmath3  pic disk : p=3.0 and 3.3 for the smallest grains ( with radii up to 10@xmath2 m ) and the larger population , respectively .",
    "since particle growth / collision processes are expected to be mainly dependent on the radial distance from the star ( weidenschilling & davis  2000 ) , the dependence on the ( mean ) grain size translates into a dependence of the exponent @xmath64 on the location within the disk .",
    "another argument for a clear deviation from @xmath79 comes from the fact that newly created small grains are likely to be removed from the system faster than larger ones may decrease this value , at least on short timescales , i.e. , as long as a small grain population resulting from collision processes is present ( see , e.g. , moro - martn & malhotra  2003 ) .",
    "we consider two different values of the exponent , @xmath64 = 2.5 and 3.5 .    in fig .",
    "[ sidi ] the seds resulting from dust disks with different grain size distributions are shown .",
    "based on the discussion above , we consider the following parameter combinations : @xmath62 = 0.1@xmath2 m , 10@xmath2 m ; @xmath63 = 0.1 mm , 1 mm , 10 mm ; and @xmath64 = 2.5 and 3.5 . comparing the seds within these parameter ranges and the considered wavelength range one can draw the main conclusion that the relative number of small grains in the system ( determined by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ) influences the shape of the sed . in particular we find that :    * increasing the maximum grain size results in a decrease of the net flux and a decrease of dust composition specific emission features . since the amount of the underlying continuum can be due either to almost featureless emission by carbon grains of arbitrary size ( distribution ) or large silicate grains , the maxium grain size might become the most difficult parameter to be derived from _",
    "measurements alone .",
    "however , millimeter measurements can be used to distinguish between the scenarios based on different slopes of the sed ( similar to what has been done in case of ttauri disks ; see beckwith & sargent  1991 ) . *",
    "given a fixed disk mass , increasing the grain size distribution exponent and decreasing the minimum grain size increases the relative amount of small grains and therefore pronounced dust - specific spectral features in the sed .",
    "the seds shown in fig .  [ sidi ] illustrate that the relative abundance of small grains and therefore the minimum grain size and grain size distribution exponent will be well - constrained disk parameters from sirtf measurements due to the abundance of spectral features in the 5 - 40@xmath2 m range ( see also fig .",
    "[ scaabs-1 ] , [ scaabs-2 ] , [ scaabs-5 ] ) .",
    "see   [ sizedis ] for a more detailed explanation and discussion .",
    "[ seddis ]    in this section we assess the likelihood of observing a particular sed given an assumed underlying distribution of the parameters we have varied in the previous subsections .",
    "we consider a plausible range of values for the minimum and maximum grain size , the radial density distribution exponent @xmath58 , and the grain size distribution exponent @xmath64 .",
    "the other disk and dust parameters are fixed : the inner radius (= sublimation radius ) , the outer radius (= 100au ) and the chemical composition of the dust ( amorphous olivine - mgfesio@xmath46 ) . according to the previous parameter range justifications for the variable quantities we calculate first the separate seds for @xmath80 grain sizes logarithmically distributed between 0.1@xmath2 m and 1000@xmath2 m in disks with 31 different radial density distribution exponents linearly distributed in the range @xmath81 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath82 separate seds . in the second step",
    "we select a lower and upper grain size randomly from this grain size distribution , assuming an equipartition of grain sizes on the prepared logarithmic grid of possible grain radii .",
    "furthermore , we randomly chose the grain size distribution exponent @xmath64 from one of 11 possible values linearly distributed in the range @xmath83 $ ] and one of the 31 radial density distribution exponents @xmath58 . in the third step",
    "we derive the net sed for a disk defined by these randomly chosen parameter settings based on the linear weighted combination of the single seds calculated in the first step . in order to allow the comparison of the ( shapes of ) seds resulting from the @xmath84 possible different disks ,",
    "the net luminosity is normalized to `` 1 '' ( arbitrary unit ) .",
    "for this reason , the single seds had to be calculated over a larger parameter range than in the previous studies in order to minimize neglected flux reemission appearing outside the considered wavelength range ; here we chose @xmath85m@xmath86 m ] . in fig .",
    "[ seddis ] the distribution of @xmath87 normalized , individual disk seds is shown , whereby the density of seds in the flux - wavelength - space is color - coded .",
    "this sed density distribution of course depends on the particular distribution of dust and disk parameters within the given parameter ranges . in order to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ seddis ] a second set of sed density distributions is shown for which the minimum and maximum grain size have been randomly selected from a linear distribution of grain sizes ( instead of from a logarithmic one as before ) .",
    "the main difference between the approaches is the much stronger pronounciation of the silicate emission bands in case of a logarithmic distribution since in that case both the mean minimum and mean maximum selected grain size is smaller than in case of a linear grid of possible grain size radii .",
    "the `` real '' ( unknown ) distribution of possible grain size boundaries depends on the outcome of collision processes .",
    "the comparison of observed sed density distributions with distributions as shown in fig .",
    "[ seddis ] but based on theoretically predicted collision scenarious may therefore provide a key to prove the underlying physics of collision processes in debris disks .",
    "the range in normalized flux density , however , over which possible debris disk seds are distributed does depend on the parameter range of the dust and disk parameters only , and is therefore the same in both apporaches .",
    "our simulations show that in case of a possible grain size distribution in the range of 0.1 - 1000@xmath2 m the most narrow distribution of already normalized seds still spans a range over more than one order of magnitude in possible fluxes ( in the range of @xmath88 m ) , but increases to above 3 orders of magnitude towards the lower and upper boundary of the considered wavelength interval .",
    "the scattering of the seds slightly decreases if the range of possible grain radii is decreased ( also fig .",
    "[ seddis ] ) .",
    "in particular , we find an additional minimum of possible flux values around @xmath89 m for our particular dust / disk setup in case of large grain size distributions ( @xmath90 m ) . this spectral regime may be the most diagnostic for determining disk masses relatively independent of the details of the assumed disk or grain properties .",
    "based on selected seds presented in previous sections we derive the colors @xmath6m@xmath7m@xmath8 and @xmath9m@xmath10m@xmath8 , applying the filter characteristics of the _ sirtf _  cameras irac ( 8@xmath2 m ) and mips ( 24@xmath2 m , 70@xmath2 m ) .",
    "the resulting color - color diagrams , shown in fig .",
    "[ col1][col3 ] , are normalized to a blackbody with a temperature of 9650k which sufficiently accurately represents the mid - infrared - to - submillimeter sed of the a0v standard star vega ( castelli & kurucz  1994 , decin et al .  2003 ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 here , @xmath93 is the dust scattering / reemission sed , @xmath94 and @xmath95 describe the wavelength - dependent filter transmission , and @xmath96 is the planck function .",
    "note in these figures that only the dust emission / scattering spectrum is represented ; the stellar photosphere has been removed in the seds .",
    "these diagrams reflect what has been outlined in the discussions about the possibility to distinguish between different disk models .",
    "for example , the color - color diagram for disks with different outer radii ( fig .",
    "[ col1 ] , upper right plot , based on the seds given in fig .",
    "[ rou ] ) shows a large dynamic range of colors and therefore clearly distinguishable models only in case of a small dust grains ( here : 0.1@xmath2 m ) .",
    "in contrast to this , a grain size distribution with grain radii of 10@xmath2 m and 1 mm the almost constant offset between the seds in the mid - infrared wavelength range results in a nearly constant value of @xmath6m@xmath97m@xmath8 .",
    "in preparation for _ sirtf _  and _ sofia _ observations of circumstellar debris disks we have investigated the influence of various disk and dust parameters on the resulting sed , in particular the offset from the stellar photospheric flux due to dust reemission and scattering processes . based on an analytic disk model we considered parameter ranges as suggested from existing observations of a small number of debris disk systems as well as constraints derived from theoretical approaches .",
    "we restricted our investigations primarily to the wavelength range accessible by _",
    "sirtf_.      1 .",
    "the correct estimation / substraction of the stellar photospheric flux is essential for the subsequent data analysis in two respects .",
    "first , it is important for the correct estimation of the dust continuum ( not taking into account any particular dust emission features ) which mainly constrains the disk mass , the upper grain size and grain size distribution exponent (   [ sizedis ] ) , the outer disk radius (   [ outerradius ] ) , and the overall radial disk density distribution exponent (   [ diskdendis ] ) .",
    "secondly , the strength of remaining stellar spectral features allows one to derive conclusions about the scattering to absorption efficiency ( or albedo ) of the dust grains and therefore - based on a simple silicate / carbon dust grain model - to derive constraints on the crystalline silicate / iron - poor amorphous silicate to iron - rich amorphous silicate / carbon ratio (   [ efficiencies ] ) .",
    "the characteristic amorphous silicate broad band solid state emission features are predicted to be of decisive importance for the characterization of the evolutionary state of debris disks .",
    "the appearance of these features depends strongly on the existence of small grains ( smaller than about 10@xmath2 m ) , the abundance of which , however , is assumed to be small in a collisionless system ( depending on the stellar sed ;   [ efficiencies ] and   [ sizedis ] ) .",
    "the strength of these features will allow to decide if collision processes took place still recently in the disk of the particular star .",
    "however , one has to take into account that only `` snapshots '' of the current , in respect of the timescale of the collisional events arbitrarily selected states of debris disks can be obtained .",
    "the sed and thus the derived smallest size of highly abundant grains does therefore not necessarily describe the real , `` mean '' evolutionary state of a particular disk ( if defined by the time - dependent collision rate ) .",
    "however , surveys based on a statistically large number of debris disk systems with large subsets of stars with a similar age will allow to derive general characteristics of debris disks as a function of their ( evolutionary ) age .",
    "the mid - infrared continuum will allow to conclude if an inner hole - due to the presence of at least one embedded planet - exists .",
    "furthermore , the inner radius of that gap (= orbit of the planet ) could be derived (   [ sec_gaps ] ) .",
    "the presented study was performed to address the most fundamental questions one will want to answer with the analysis of the sed of debris disk systems .",
    "based on this `` first - level '' analysis , a more detailed investigation of particular debris disk systems will be possible . for instance",
    ", the radial segregation of chemically different dust grains , the spatial distribution of ice - mantled grains with spectral features in the range of 10 - 100@xmath2 m range ( e.g. , warren  1984 ) , the possibility to distinguish qualitatively different planetary architectures embedded in debris disks ( moro - martn & malhotra  2002 ) , and the determination of characteristic wavelength ranges in which planetary radiation  in particular astrobiological tracers  can be separated from the underlying dust continuum radiation ( beichmann  1996 , fischer & pfau  1997 ) are tasks which are beyond the recent study and will be considered in a subsequent investigation .    s.  wolf was supported through the nasa grant nag5 - 11645 and through the sirtf legacy science program through an award issued by jpl / cit under nasa contract 1407 .",

    "<S> we present results of a study aimed at deriving fundamental properties of circumstellar debris disks from observed infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation is motivated by increasing telescope / detector sensitivity , in particular the expected availability of the _ space infrared telescope facility _ ( _ sirtf _ ) followed by the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( _ sofia _ ) , which will enable detailed studies with large source samples of late stage circumstellar disk and planetary system evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we base our study on an analytic model of the disk density distribution and geometry , taking into account existing constraints from observations and results of theoretical investigations of debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> we also outline the effects of the most profound characteristics of circumstellar dust including the grain size distribution and dust chemical composition . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that an increasing iron content in silicates mainly causes an increase of the dust absorption effiency and thus increases the dust reemission continuum . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the influence of the sp@xmath0/sp@xmath1 hybridization ratio in carbon grains on the spectral energy distribution is examined . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of various parameters on the resulting dust scattering and absorption / reemission spectral energy distribution and discuss the possibility for distinguishing between different disks from their infrared to submillimeter spectra </S>",
    "<S> . the strength and shape of amorphous silicate may be particularly diagnostic of debris disk evolutionary stages . since the appearance of these features at 10@xmath2 m and 20@xmath2 m depends on the relative abundance of small grains - and therefore the minimum grain size and slope of the grain size distribution </S>",
    "<S> - they can be used to trace recent collisional processes in debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> thus , debris disk surveys containing statistically large numbers of objects should reveal the likelihood of collisions and therefore the evolution of dust / planetesimals in debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our study underline the importance of knowledge of the stellar photospheric flux , especially in the near to mid - infrared wavelength range , for a proper analysis of debris disk spectral energy distributions : while the quality of subtraction of the direct stellar light at far - infrared wavelengths determines the accuracy of the mass estimate in the disk , our simulations show that the remaining stellar contribution due to scattering at near- to mid - infrared wavelengths constrains the dust grain size and chemical composition , e.g. the iron abundance in silicate grains . </S>"
