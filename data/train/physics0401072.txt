    "an 800-liter lxe ( liquid xenon ) scintillation @xmath0-detector is being developed for the meg experiment , which will search for the @xmath1 decay at the paul scherrer institute  @xcite .",
    "the meg calorimeter is designed to achieve superior performances such as @xmath2 for the @xmath0  energy , a position resolution @xmath3 mm , and @xmath4  ps for timing , where @xmath5 stands for the fwhm resolution .",
    "the lxe calorimeter is only based on scintillation light without any attempt to measure ionization .",
    "the final detector will have an active volume of 800-liter lxe and 800 pmts .",
    "since no such large size lxe detector was ever produced , smaller prototypes were made to gain a know - how in lxe calorimetry .",
    "the first prototype had an active volume of 2.34 liter lxe and 32 pmts @xcite .",
    "a second prototype has an active volume of 68.6 lxe and it is an important milestone in view of the final detector , since it allows to gain a practical knowledge of the behaviour of such a device . above all , the purification of lxe and the long - term stability are essential for ensuring a high light yield and a high performance of the detector .",
    "the optical properties of xenon in the vuv , where it emits when excited by ionizing radiation , determine the performances of the calorimeter .",
    "these properties are not very well known for lxe .",
    "measurements are difficult and experimental results are often not fully compatible .",
    "as it will be discussed in detail in the next sections , extensive measurements are available for gaseous xe at various pressures , many in the visible region and some in the uv .",
    "the present note critically examines the experimental data .",

    "within which xe can be described by a simple approximation of a more general expression valid for generic fluids .",

    "the observation that the simple clausius - mossotti equation ( depending only on the first virial coefficient @xmath36 , whatever the fluid density and state ) might be valid for noble gases has already been made @xcite . at a closer look for xe , it comes out that when one is approaching the region of the xe photon absorption lines , the clausius - mossotti equation is only marginally valid , but it can be considered an acceptable approximation still at the lxe emission line .",
    "xenon excited by ionizing radiation emits at @xmath32  nm , that is photons with @xmath37  ev .",
    "photon absorption lines are at higher energies starting from about 8.4 ev .",
    "the index of refraction @xmath21 and its absorbitive part @xmath38 were extensively studied in the energy region from 7.8 to 8.8 ev over a wide pressure range , from dilute gas to the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , when the density reaches high values , the absorption lines are distorted and broadened and a system of satellite lines appears , always at energies lower than the main lines .",
    "this phenomenon is explained in terms of exciton formationnm regions of the fluid . ]",
    "@xcite and can be immediately related to higher density terms in the virial expansion . as a consequence",
    "the clausius - mossotti relation is no longer linear in @xmath39 at photon energies close to the absorption lines .",
    "nevertheless we checked that , when one moves to lower energies , the linearity in @xmath39 appears to be recovered and the values of @xmath40 in ( [ eqn : f1 ] ) come out to be roughly the same , whatever the pressure .",
    "this means that in the virial expansion : @xmath41 \\rho_{m } \\label{eqn : f7}\\ ] ] the higher order terms give small contributions and that the @xmath36 term dominates .",
    "since , as already noted , some discrepancies exist among the optical data obtained by different authors , in lxe at 7.0  ev , no fully reliable value of optical parameters at 7.0 ev is available or can be extrapolated from higher energy measurements .",
    "the only conclusion we can reliably reach is that , in the energy region around 7.0 ev , the simple clausius - mossotti equation is valid with good approximation and that this statement rests on experimental data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pap1 ] , [ fig : pap2 ] , [ fig : pap5 ] , [ fig : pap6 ] and [ fig : pap7 ] where all the vuv results  @xcite were used to compute @xmath42 , in the hypothesis of the validity of the simple clausius - mossotti equation . one can observe that for energies up to @xmath43  ev the @xmath44 data are well fitted by a linear dependence on the density , over quite a wide density range from dilute gas to liquid .",
    "@xmath45 , the slope of the fitted lines , corresponds to a rather constant value , up to 8.1  ev , as it appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : pap10 ] . at higher photon energies ,",
    "hence closer to the xe photon absorption lines , the fits become increasingly worse , the linear model is rejected ( and the error on @xmath45 is meaningless ) .     as a function of the density @xmath46 , from the gas to the liquid phase at h@xmath47=7.9 ev . ]     as a function of the density @xmath46 , from the gas to the liquid phase h@xmath47=8.0 ev . ]     as a function of the density @xmath46 , from the gas to the liquid phase h@xmath47=8.1 ev . ]     as a function of the density @xmath46 , from the gas to the liquid phase h@xmath47=8.2 ev . ]     as a function of the density @xmath46 , from the gas to the liquid phase h@xmath47=8.3 ev . ]     as a function of the density @xmath46 , at different photon energies .",
    "@xmath45 approximately corresponds to a constant value up to @xmath48  ev . ]",
    "one can therefore conclude that , when @xmath49 is reasonably far from the absorption region , most of the information obtained for gaseous xenon in various physical conditions can be used for predicting the optical properties of lxe at the emission wavelength @xcite .",
    "the experimental determinations of the refractive index in lxe , at the xe emission wavelength of @xmath50  nm @xcite and at @xmath51  nm @xcite , are presented in fig.[fig : pap3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the errors on @xmath21 are the ones quoted in the papers with the exception of @xcite , which has very small errors from point to point , but a systematic error on @xmath21 which is not clearly stated ; we assumed a systematic error of @xmath52 .",
    "the measured refractive index is compared with an extrapolated value we derived , based on the simple clausius - mossotti equation utilizing vuv data obtained in gas at low density @xcite .",
    "one can observe a rather good agreement between the measured @xmath21 and the extrapolated value .",
    "the measurement corresponding to @xcite gives a @xmath21 value at 180 nm which is somewhat low , but the experimental error , quoted in the paper , appears to us over - optimistic .",
    "since we assumed ( and checked ) the validity of the simple clausius - mossotti equation , the relation between @xmath53 and @xmath45 is fixed .",
    "we present in fig.[fig : pap4 ] the dispersive behaviour of @xmath45 as a function of the photon energy @xmath54 .",
    "the open circles are the vuv measurements @xcite obtained at low density ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the dashed line is the fit to those points .",

    "the experimental measurements of the refractive index @xmath21 in lxe at @xmath50 and @xmath67 @xcite are also shown by their corresponding @xmath45 , as black symbols .",
    "we discuss now the relation between the index of refraction @xmath21 and the rayleigh scattering length @xmath68 . for dilute xe",
    "a simple relation is valid : @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath38 is the wave number of the radiation and @xmath70 is the number of molecules per unit volume . for a dense fluid like",

    "this expression reduces to ( [ eqn : hr ] ) in the case of dilute gases .",
    "+ since xenon is a non - polar fluid , the second part of ( [ eqn : h1 ] ) comes out to be neglegible  @xcite . the derivative appearing in the first part of ( [ eqn : h1 ] ) can be computed from the clausius - mossotti equation ( [ eqn : f2 ] ) .",

    "vs @xmath21 from equation [ eqn : h3 ] ( black points ) .",
    "the average over the lxe emission spectrum is also shown ( open points ) .",
    "the only available experimental measurement of both @xmath68 and @xmath21 is compared with the prediction of our model . ]",
    "@xmath68 vs @xmath21 from equation ( [ eqn : h3 ] ) ( black circles ) is presented in fig.[fig : pap15 ] .",
    "the input values for the refractive index @xmath53 are the ones obtained from a fit to the low pressure vuv measurements @xcite .",
    "the simple clausius - mossotti relation ( [ eqn : f2 ] ) ( and its linearity as a function of @xmath39 ) is assumed to be valid .",
    "there are only two published measurements of the rayleigh scattering length in lxe at @xmath80 which gave @xmath81 @xcite and @xmath82 @xcite ( in this last case the refractive index was also measured ) ; we note that the two values are far apart .",
    "these determinations were obtained for light produced by radioactive source excitation of lxe .",
    "this means that the measured @xmath68 is an average over the 14  nm fwhm lxe emission spectrum . in checking the validity of equation ( [ eqn : h3 ] ) an average over the lxe emission spectrum",
    "must therefore be performed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pap15 ] equation ( [ eqn : h3 ] ) is also shown after averaging over the lxe emission spectrum ( open circles ) ; the differences between the two curves are small . in the same figure the only available experimental measurement of both @xmath21 and @xmath68 @xcite ( black square ) is compared with the extrapolated values for the same two quantities ( open triangle ) obtained , as already explained , from the low - pressure vuv data and the clausius - mossotti relation .    in the case of small amounts ( ppm ) of other rare gases , like ar or kr ,",
    "added to xe , ( [ eqn : h3 ] ) preserves its validity and @xmath68 does not vary appreciably .",
    "this is not true in the case of absorbing contaminants , as it was shown during the tests of the large prototype detector @xcite .",
    "the experimental determination of lxe optical properties at the @xmath32  nm emission line is not sufficiently complete and reliable . the literature on optical characteristics of xe in other spectral regions and at various densities is critically examined .",
    "these data can be used to evaluate the refractive index @xmath21 and the rayleigh scattering length @xmath68 in the vuv for lxe since the validity , with good approximation , of the simple clausius - mossotti relation is confirmed from dilute gas to liquid densities .",
