    "reliable flux calibration is important for accurate photometry , and to compare observations taken by different observers , at different times or different sites , with different equipment and possibly different filter bandpasses .",
    "ground based optical calibration is traditionally achieved by observing with the same equipment both standard stars and at least some stars in the field of interest , during periods known to be photometric . in principle",
    "this permits calibration of program stars on a standard photometric system to better than 1% , but in practice filter and instrumental mismatches , atmospheric and other variations during this process often limits effective calibration to 2% or worse .    internal relative flux calibration of single or repeated data sets",
    "are routinely achieved to 0.2% or better , including during non - photometric conditions , by reference to non - variable stars in the observed field .",
    "but significant questions arise about effective cross calibration of observations from different epochs .",
    "the situation is particularly complicated for time - domain science , where multiple sites , telescope apertures , filters and sets of instrumentation become involved , or when time constraints or observing conditions preclude traditional calibrations .",
    "offsets between otherwise very accurate data sets can be much larger than expected .",
    "this can introduce significant uncertainty in multi - observation analysis , or obscure real variations .",
    "cross comparisons can be facilitated by parallel wide - field observations along the line of sight to each image , as in the cfht skyprobe facility @xcite , or other `` context '' camera systems .",
    "but having multi - filter standards within each digital image offers many simplifying advantages .",
    "the ideal scenario for calibration of optical imaging data would be if there were all - sky stars of adequately known brightness on standard photometric systems , and present in sufficient numbers to provide a few in every digital image .",
    "precursors to such standards include i ) the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) of 360 million objects , observed with a 2.5 m telescope to about 22mag in _ ugriz _ filters and covering about @xmath13 of the sky @xcite , ii ) the 2mass whole sky survey of about 300 million stars observed with two 1.3 m telescopes to about 15mag in @xmath3 filters @xcite , and iii ) the usno nomad catalog @xcite , which contains over 1 billion stars covering the whole sky .",
    "it is often used for automatic astrometric fits , and has calibrated photographic @xmath2-band photometry ( on the landolt system ) with a dispersion of about 0.25mag .",
    "the tycho2 catalog @xcite provides a consistent set of all - sky optical standards , observed with the _ hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "it provides @xmath122.5million stars to about 13.5 & 12.5mag in @xmath14 & @xmath15 filters . while this catalog contains less than 1% of the stars in the 2mass catalog , and has large photometric errors at the faint end , it forms the basis along with 2mass and nomad for an effective and consistent all - sky photometric catalog , that can be used now by many optical telescopes to achieve reasonable automatic flux calibration .",
    "the average density of tycho2 stars varies from @xmath12150 stars per square degree at galactic latitude @xmath16 , through @xmath1250 stars per square degree at @xmath17 to @xmath1225 stars per square degree at @xmath18 @xcite , so it is typically possible to find 515 tycho2 stars within a 30-arcmin field of view .",
    "these numbers obviously decrease for smaller fields of view , and become uninteresting for fields of view much smaller than 15-arcmin .",
    "the footprints in equatorial coordinates of several catalogs discussed here are shown in figure [ footprint ] .",
    "@xcite described how to produce synthetic _",
    "magnitudes for about 1.6 m tycho2 stars brighter than 12mag in @xmath15 and 13mag in @xmath14 .",
    "the present paper extends this to 2.4 m tycho2 stars , with synthetic magnitudes on both the landolt and sloan standard photometric systems , and to other filter systems calibrated here such as stromgren and ukirt @xmath19 & @xmath7 .",
    "the methodology permits _ post facto _ extrapolation to other filter systems of interest , and can be applied to future all - sky catalogs of greater depth and accuracy .    in section  [ synthetic ]",

    "this is the basic convolution methodology used in the hst _ synphot _ package . from the synphot user s guide we can form :    @xmath24    where the numerical factor for the nominal @xmath21 at v=0 brings the resultant magnitudes close to standard values ] .",
    "additionally , as discussed in the `` principles of calibration '' section of the synphot user s guide , we can form the effective wavelength    @xmath25    and the source - independent pivot wavelength    @xmath26    and form a magnitude system based on @xmath27 as @xmath28 where the numeric constant , as derived in @xcite , has the advantage of bringing @xmath29 close to the ab79 system of @xcite .",
    "the bandpass zeropoints in equation [ eq-1 ] are to be determined .",
    "@xcite adopted a different approach based on mean flux per frequency in the bandpass @xmath30 .",
    "the differences between this and the _ synphot _ methods for calculating magnitudes are typically of order 0.02 to 0.04  mag over most of the color range , but for very red stars with non - smooth spectra can become as large as 0.1  mag in @xmath31 , which has an extended red tail .",
    "importantly , the _ synphot _ approach produces less zeropoint dispersion for stars covering a wide range of type and color , and is adopted here .",
    "all the filter - bands discussed here ( except the medium - band stromgren filters ) are illustrated in figure [ figfilt ] . only the wavelength coverage and particularly the _ shape _ of the system bandpass matters ,",

    "they reinforce the advances that have been made in accurate flux calibration , as the result of careful work by @xcite .",

    ".    it may seem that the landolt system response curves would provide the optimum synthetic matches to landolt photometry , but this is not necessarily the case , and not shown by our results in table [ tbl - zp ] and illustrated in figure [ uizero ] .",
    "both landolt and kron - cousins measurements seek to emulate the original johnson system for ubv .",
    "both apply calibrating steps in terms of color to their instrumental magnitudes , to bring them into correspondence with standard system values extending back several decades .",
    "these steps are summarized in @xcite for example , and in @xcite to illustrate how equipment changes over time have required slightly different color corrections to maintain integrity with the original system definition .",
    "these calibration steps are further reviewed in @xcite .",
    "real photometry is done with bandpasses that can vary with evolving instrumentation .",
    "we could measure synthetic magnitudes in the landolt bandpasses and apply color corrections to achieve `` standard '' values .",
    "but synthetic photometry of flux calibrated spectra has the advantage of being able to select bandpass profiles that minimize dispersion and color effects .",
    "we have not attempted to optimize any bandpasses here , but have selected amoung those available from the literature . for ubvri , the results in table [ tbl - zp ] indicate that these are best provided by the @xmath52 bandpasses .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions are 0.027 , 0.020 , 0.008 , 0.014 and 0.016 mag for @xmath52 respectively in table [ tbl - zp ] , for the full color range from white dwarfs to vb8 ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "figure [ uizero ] illustrates that the selected bands show much less zeropoint dispersion than do @xmath53 , with negligible trend with color . in figure [ uizero ] ( and for other zeropoint figures ) the ordinate is inverted so that zeropoints that appear vertically higher result in larger ( fainter ) magnitudes .",
    "this is _ not _ a criticism of landolt system response curves , which enable accurate photometry with appropriate calibration and color corrections , but indicates that the selected @xmath52 system profiles are best for deriving synthetic spectrophotometry of flux calibrated spectra to properly match landolt photometry .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions for @xmath54 from @xcite are worse , at 0.050 and 0.024 mag respectively .",
    "the dispersion for @xmath55 is marginally worse than for @xmath56 , where @xmath56 has a slightly more elongated red tail than @xmath55 .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions for @xmath5 and @xmath9 ( primed and unprimed ) in table [ tbl - zp ] , typically closer to 0.02 mag than 0.01mag , indicate both the accuracy and the limitations of comparing synthetic photometry of well calibrated spectra with good standard photometry .",
    "tighter fits can be obtained by restricting the selection of comparison stars , for instance to only wd standards , but such zeropoints can then be a function of color and lead to synthesized magnitude errors for other stellar types much larger than the nominal dispersion for a restricted set of standards .",
    "we are gratified that these comparisons match so well over a large range of color and standard types , confirming the increasing correspondence ( currently at the 13% level ) between spectrophotometric and photometric standards .",
    "this sets the basis for enabling synthetic magnitudes of an extended spectral library to be calibrated on standard photometric systems .",
    "the system transmission functions for @xmath1 have been taken from @xcite .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions for @xmath1 are 0.045 and 0.020 respectively , which is acceptable given the typical errors in the photometric values for fainter stars , and several stars included here .",
    "there are a total of 7 values covering a color range from white dwarfs to g dwarfs for @xmath14 , but only 5 with accurate @xmath15 information , with hd209458 ( g0v  out of planet occultation ) being the reddest comparison standard for @xmath1 .",

    "we refer to ( upper case ) @xmath6 for these filter bandpasses , where we are using the subscript `` v '' to refer to both the vista / ukidss consortium and the fact that these are _ vega _ based magnitudes .",
    "the ukirt wfcam detector qe is not included in the system bandpass but , unlike a ccd , is roughly flat over these wavelengths .",
    "the dispersions for @xmath6 zeropoints , compared to only 5 and 4 ukirt standards measured with the wfcam filters , are 0.038 and 0.031 mag respectively .",
    "the @xmath57 zeropoint for g158 - 100 is suspect as its _ calspec _ spectrum is not well defined at 1@xmath32 .",
    "@xmath6 zeropoint determinations may improve as more photometric standards in common with spectrophotometric standards are measured .",
    "the zeropoint results and somewhat restricted color ranges for @xmath58 are illustrated in figure [ bvzyzero ] .",
    "having a wider color range here for comparison would clearly be advantageous , but there are several mitigating factors .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath6 bandpasses are more `` rectangular '' in shape than are the @xmath42 and @xmath59 bandpasses for example .",
    "they have effective wavelengths that vary less with color , and are therefore less susceptible to color effects suffered by filters with extended `` tails '' .",
    "the range of effective wavelengths from white dwarfs to vb8 are 416.3 to 440.4 nm , 524.3 to 543.1 nm , 875.1 to 884.9 nm , and 1018.8 to 1023.2 nm for @xmath58 respectively .",
    "also the @xmath60 colors derived from our synthesized _ libmags _ flux library ( see section [ library ] ) follow the standard tycho2 conversion formulas , with standard deviations less than 0.02 & 0.03mag respectively over a large color range .    @xmath61    @xmath62    similarly , as shown in section [ zy ] , the synthesized @xmath63 and @xmath64 data fit well over a wide color range , indicating an extended range of validity beyond that illustrated in figure [ bvzyzero ] .    the @xmath57 data are included because several survey cameras ( panstarrs , skymapper , dark energy survey ( des ) , ukidss / vista and our lcogt monitoring cameras are using or plan to use a y filter at @xmath121 micron .",
    "this is further discussed in section [ zy ] .",
    "the transmission functions of the 2mass filters , including detector and typical atmosphere , have been taken from the _ ipac _ website .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions for @xmath20 , indicated graphically in figure [ jkzero ] , are about 0.02 mag , quite comparable to the typical ( low ) 2mass errors for these stars , and the zeropoints show no trend with color .",
    "the transmission functions for the jhk filters on the mauna kea observatory ( mko ) system have been taken from @xcite .",
    "unlike the 2mass system bandpasses , these do not include detector qe or atmosphere .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions for @xmath7 are 0.02 , 0.02 and 0.04 respectively , for relatively few standards , but they do show trends with color .",
    "we indicate the @xmath47 zeropoint for vb8 in figure [ jkzero ] but , due to uncertainty with its catalog magnitude , have not included it in the @xmath47 zeropoint average .",
    "the transmission functions for the stromgren filters ( not illustrated ) are from @xcite .",
    "the zeropoints derived in table [ tbl - zp ] are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for stromgren @xmath8 respectively .",
    "these are averaged over 7 _ calspec _ white dwarfs for which stromgren photometry was found in the literature .",
    "the validity of these zeropoints for redder stars is not demonstrated , but the effective wavelength variations with color are small for medium band filters with `` rectangular '' profiles , so zeropoint variations with color should not be large for the stromgren filter bandpasses .      the @xmath69 filter system profile shown in figure [ figfilt ] is a `` mould '' r - band interference filter with rectangular profile , of the type used at many observatories to measure r on the landolt system . in this case",
    "it is the cfh12k 7603 filter originally from cfht and now used by ptf .",
    "the @xmath69 system profile includes the ccd response and atmospheric transmission appropriate to 1.7 km and airmass1.3 , although both of these are roughly flat in this region .",
    "the zeropoint ( table [ tbl - zp ] ) for this filter profile excludes vb8 , since the lack of a red - tail results in magnitudes which are too faint for stars redder than @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ rpplot ] shows ( upper panel ) the comparison of @xmath71 with landolt @xmath72 color , which results in a tight 2-segment curved fit .",
    "the lower two panels show @xmath71 and @xmath73 against the sloan @xmath74 color , both of which show reasonable 2-segment linear fits , confirming that rectangular - shaped `` mould '' r observations can be reliably converted to standard r magnitudes .",
    "@xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78      the usno nomad catalog @xcite contains bvr and jhk data for many stars .",
    "the nomad @xmath36 data for brighter stars are typically derived from tycho2 @xmath1 using standard conversion formulas referenced in section [ zp ] .",
    "it is possible to compare these converted values with synthesized bv magnitudes , but it is better and more accurate to compare as we have done the tycho2 @xmath1 values directly with their synthesized values in the @xmath1 system bandpasses .",
    "the nomad jhk magnitudes are from 2mass , so do not provide additional information .",
    "the nomad r - band data are derived from the usno - b catalog which was photometrically calibrated against tycho2 stars at the bright end , and two fainter catalogs as described in @xcite , with a typical standard deviation of 0.25 mag .",
    "figure [ rnomad ] illustrates our comparison of nomad r - band data against landolt standards , and 16 _ calspec _ standards .",
    "the data are plotted as the differences @xmath79 vs. @xmath80 .",
    "a @xmath81 clip has been applied which excludes about 10 stars plotted as black crosses , but retains more than 98% plotted as grey ( red in electronic color version ) crosses .",
    "the dashed histogram of all the stars shows the distribution of these differences plotted with increasing number to the right against the magnitude delta on the ordinate .",
    "this shows a good one - to - one fit , with zero mean offset and a @xmath11 dispersion of 0.25mag for sigma clipped landolt stars .",
    "the equivalent dispersion is 0.17mag for the _ calspec _ stars excluding vb8 .",
    "the location of the red m dwarf vb8 is indicated : the photographic r band , like the `` mould '' type r - band above lacks the red - tail of the kron / cousins / landolt r filter , so measures magnitudes which are too faint for extremely red stars where the flux is rising rapidly through the bandpass .",
    "it would be preferable to compare digitized photographic r - magnitudes with synthesized values in the appropriate system bandpass , but this is clearly impossible , and probably would not improve this calibration .",
    "the nomad r - band calibration is linear over a significant magnitude range and the dispersion is roughly constant with magnitude , probably indicating the difficulties of measuring digitized plates rather than any linearity or systemic calibration issues .    in section",
    "[ matching ] we include the nomad @xmath2 band data together with tycho2 and 2mass magnitudes to provide 6-band spectral matching of the tycho2 stars , where the catalog @xmath2 is matched to our synthesized @xmath82 magnitude , because inclusion does improve the fits slightly over just tycho2/2mass fits .",
    "we adopt a photometric error of 0.25mag for all nomad @xmath2 magnitudes .",
    "the system transmission functions of the unprimed @xmath9 filters used in the imaging camera , including typical atmosphere and detector response , have been taken from the _ skyservice _ website at johns hopkins university ( jhu ) .",
    "those for the primed @xmath0 filters used for standard observations have been taken from the united states naval observatory ( usno ) website , for 1.3 airmasses .    in order to compute zeropoints for the imaging survey ( unprimed ) sloan bandpasses @xmath9 , we computed conversion relations between the primed and unprimed sloan system values by comparing synthetic magnitudes of digital library spectra from @xcite , as listed in electronic table _ libmags _ ( section [ library ] ) .",
    "this approach avoids many complexities detailed in @xcite , but produces tight correspondence between synthetically derived sloan primed and unprimed magnitudes , over a wide color range .    with the exception of two zeropoint adjustments for @xmath83 and @xmath84 ,",

    "@xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    these relations were used to convert sdss standard values on the primed system to unprimed values ( and _ vice versa _ when only dr7 data was available , eg . for lds  749b , p177d , p330e & gd50 )",
    "then compared with synthetic magnitudes computed in the unprimed bandpasses to derive their zeropoints and dispersions .",
    "the sdss dr7 u - band data for vb8 appears too bright , likely because of the known red leak . the dr7 i - band magnitude is close to the r - band magnitude , and appears too faint for such a red star . as mentioned in section [ catmag ] we have omitted the @xmath48 and @xmath49 band data for vb8 from our zeropoint averages .",
    "the zeropoint dispersions for @xmath0 and @xmath9 listed in table [ tbl - zp ] are about 0.02 mag ( slightly worse for the g - band ) for up to 14 standards covering a wide color range .",
    "there is little evidence for non - zero zeropoints in _ griz _ ; they are zero to within our measured dispersions , and we have chosen to set them zero .",

    "we find synthetic spectrophotometry with the published sloan system transmission functions ( @xmath0 & @xmath9 ) matches sloan standard values well , with the quoted zeropoints and no color terms .",
    "we note however that there are commercial `` sloan '' filters available that have excellent throughput , but which do not match the bandpasses of the sloan filters precisely , for instance with an @xmath92 break close to 800 nm .",
    "we checked synthetic spectrophotometry of our library spectra with a measured set of such filters ( and standard atmosphere & ccd response ) against standard sloan values .",

    "the factors are not completely independent , but are inter - connected by the library spectra themselves .",
    "fitted magnitudes in u / u or b / g for instance can be improved slightly by reducing the scale factor for these bands , but at the expense of slightly worse fits in redder bands .",

    "good fits normally have @xmath142 because of the normalization by photometric errors and number of filters , but higher values are possible when there are significant differences between catalog and synthetic magnitudes in one or more bands    several fits at the top of the ordered list may have close , and good fits .",
    "these typically represent uncertainty between close spectral types , metal - rich spectra of slightly earlier type , metal - weak spectra of later type , or confusion between dwarf , giant or even supergiant spectra of similar colors .",
    "additional constraints used to discriminate between these cases are described below .",
    "the predicted magnitudes of fits with similar @xmath132 values are themselves similar to within 13% .",

    "we did not use parallax measurements directly to determine distance , as they are not available for most catalog stars .    for catalog stars with",
    "low or no known proper motion , we set a somewhat arbitrary galactic upper distance limit of 20kpc .",
    "usually this excludes supergiants , except where the catalog star is bright , but does not exclude giant fits .",
