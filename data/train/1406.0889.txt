    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments under applied magnetic field at low temperatures show detailed low lying magnetic excitations in the so called tridiminshed iron icosahedron magnetic molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic molecule consists of nine iron fe@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and three phosphorous atoms that are situated on the twelve vertices of a nearly perfect icosahedron . </S>",
    "<S> the three phosphorous atoms form a plane that separates the iron cluster into two weakly coupled three- and six - ion fragments , \\{fe@xmath2 } and \\{fe@xmath3 } , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field ins results exhibit an @xmath4 ground state expected from a perfect equilateral triangle of the \\{fe@xmath2 } triad with a powder averaged @xmath5-value @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> two sets of triplet excitations whose temperature and magnetic field dependence indicate an @xmath7 ground state with two non - degenerate @xmath8 states are attributed to the \\{fe@xmath3 } fragment . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting may result from a finite coupling between the two fragments , single - ion anisotropy , antisymmetric exchange couplings , or from magnetic frustration of its triangular building blocks .    </S>",
    "<S> single - molecule magnets have been emerging as the necessary ingredients to transform molecular electronics into molecular spintronics , albeit not without challenges in synthesis , characterization , and theoretical modeling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> progress in synthesizing , by design , bulk magnetic molecules has brought about new insights into magnetic phenomena in the nanoscale regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a current challenge in this research area is the synthesis of magnetic clusters that can operate as nano - switches . </S>",
    "<S> one such hypothetical system is an iron based icosahedron magnetic cluster \\{fe@xmath9 } , that theoretical calculations show undergoes a first order metamagnetic transition with an associated hysteretic behavior that renders it magnetic nano - switch like properties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the perfect icosahedron has not yet materialized , a closely related molecule of tridimished icosahedron \\{fe@xmath10 } , with the chemical formula [ ( fe@xmath10-@xmath11-o)@xmath12(o@xmath2pph)@xmath2(o@xmath13ccme@xmath2)@xmath14 , has been synthesized and characterized@xcite . in each \\{fe@xmath10 } </S>",
    "<S> cluster , fe@xmath0 ions ( spins @xmath1 ) occupy nine of the twelve sites of an icosahedron ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : molecule ] ) whereas the remaining three vertices are occupied by p atoms of tri - phenylphosphonate . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of exchange paths and susceptibility data indicate that the icosahedron can be divided into two nearly decoupled clusters : an \\{fe@xmath3 } cluster , with an @xmath7 ground state , and an \\{fe@xmath2 } triangle with @xmath4 ground state .    here , we report on the low - lying magnetic excitations of a partially deuterated polycrystalline sample of the \\{fe@xmath10 } molecule and their dependence on temperature and applied magnetic field obtained from inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> ins has become a pivotal tool in determining the magnetic spectra of magnetic molecules@xcite in particular , since the seminal study by caciuffo and coworker of the \\{fe@xmath15 } molecule with frustrated afm couplings that render the molecule @xmath16 ground state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , ins has been employed to the cr@xmath15 afm ring to detect propagation of quantum fluctuations along the ring@xcite , and in the related \\{cr@xmath17ni } ring to demonstrate that under external magnetic field an avoided crossing between energy levels of different total - spin quantum numbers can be identified@xcite . in a systematic study of various magnetic molecules , </S>",
    "<S> frustration effects have been classified by use of ins experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> employing ins , we monitor the response of the \\{fe@xmath10 } nano cluster to magnetic field and temperature to obtain a comprehensive picture of the low - lying excitations .    } molecule used in this study . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the core icosahedron is occupied by nine iron and three phosphorus ions . </S>",
    "<S> the three phosphorus atoms separate the iron atoms into two \\{fe@xmath3 } and \\{fe@xmath2 } fragments . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the topology ( and exchange pathways ) in the \\{fe@xmath3 } and \\{fe@xmath2 } clusters . </S>",
    "<S> arrows , representing spins , illustrate geometrical frustration but do not correspond to actual spin orientations in each fragment . ]    the ins measurements were performed on approximately 4 g of polycrystalline sample that was sealed under helium atmosphere in a copper can and placed in a dilution refrigerator with the capability to cool the sample to base temperature of 0.1 k , and to apply magnetic field up to 5 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic neutron spectra were collected on the osiris time - of - flight spectrometer at isis , which was set up at a fixed final neutron energy of @xmath18 mev that was selected by a pyrolytic graphite pg(002 ) analyzer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution , that osiris provides , is approximately 23 to 27 @xmath19ev over the energy - transfer range from zero to 2 mev.@xcite the obtained energy @xmath20 momentum - transfer ( @xmath21 ) slices of the spectra exhibit distinct excitations that are dispersionless as expected from non - interacting ( i.e. , zero - dimensional ) magnetic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the variation of the magnetic form factor of fe@xmath0 is less than 5% over the measured @xmath22-range . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore integrate intensities over the measured @xmath22 range to improve signal statistics , without loss of information . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of ins for magnetic molecules has been extensively detailed in the literature@xcite .     to 1.8 @xmath23 for \\{fe@xmath10 } at @xmath24 k at 0 and at 2 tesla . </S>",

    "<S> we reduce the data by using a procedure we employed in similar ins studies of the \\{mo@xmath27fe@xmath28 } and \\{cr@xmath15 } magnetic molecules.@xcite the quasi - elastic term representing the instrumental resolution function , the incoherent and static disorder due to the sample , is modeled by a sum of two co - centered peaks : a dominant gaussian and a minor lorentzian . to obtain reliable parameters of the gaussian / lorentzian , </S>",
    "<S> the spectra at various temperatures are refined simultaneously , with extra peaks due to magnetic excitations from the sample , while maintaining the same values of these parameters for the refinements of the various data sets at all measured temperatures , and fields . by subtracting the co - centered gaussian / lorentzian function from data , such as those shown in the inset of fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data - reduction](a ) we obtain the intrinsic magnetic excitations from the sample as shown in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data - reduction](a ) at 0.1 k at 0 and at 2 t@xcite . using this procedure </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the spectra as a function of temperature at zero magnetic field ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : temp ] ) and as a function of applied magnetic field at base temperature fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data - reduction](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra at base temperature consist of two types of excitations ; one that appears at zero magnetic field and the other emerges only with the application of external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the spectra in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : data - reduction ] shows a weak peak at @xmath29 mev that did not show any magnetic field or temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore attribute this excitation to a low energy vibrational and or rotational excitation of the molecule and therefore is irrelevant to the present study .     and @xmath30 t. the solid line is a fit to the data at @xmath31 using sum of six gaussians the positions of which are indicated by arrows . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) illustration of the energy levels of the \\{fe@xmath3 } cluster at @xmath32 k and at higher temperatures , showing the emergence of the peak at 0.5 mev from the partially populated @xmath33 to the next @xmath34 level.,width=2 ]    figure  [ fig : temp](a ) shows intrinsic spectra of two excitations centered at @xmath35 and at @xmath36 mev at various temperatures that we attribute to @xmath33 and @xmath34 spin states , as justified below . </S>",
    "<S> each of the two excitations is adequately described by three gaussians with peak positions that are evenly displaced at @xmath37 and at @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated by a fit to the data with a sum of six gaussians ( solid line ) to the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath41 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : temp](b ) at 0.1 k at zero field . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic susceptibility is practically @xmath42-independent given by@xcite @xmath43^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant . as the temperature increases </S>",
    "<S> , an excitation emerges at exactly the difference between the centers of the two excited states at @xmath45 mev , characteristic of discrete thermally induced excitation from the lower , now populated level @xmath46 , to the upper near - by @xmath47 state . </S>",
    "<S> this new excitation ( @xmath45 ) is narrower than the combined triplet as expected by selection rules between these two @xmath8 states as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : temp](c ) , namely , @xmath48 and for the magnetic quantum numbers , @xmath49 . further evidence that these excitations are magnetic in origin is demonstrated by the strong effect the magnetic field has on the spectra , in particular in shifting the spectra to lower and higher energies ( albeit smeared and impossible to resolve ) from the @xmath37s as expected from zeeman effect on the magnetic quantum states @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> . these observations are consistent with the low - lying magnetic states of the \\{fe@xmath3 } cluster as shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : temp](c ) . while two degenerate excited @xmath8 states at approximately 1 mev ( with six degenerate magnetic quantum numbers ) </S>",
    "<S> have been predicted in a previous study for this molecule@xcite , the ins presented here shows a more detailed magnetic structure with two @xmath8 states that are split into their quantum magnetic numbers . </S>",
    "<S> similar splitting in the spin - excitations of the singlet ground state of srcu@xmath13(bo@xmath2)@xmath13 has been attributed to the dzyaloshinski - moriya type interaction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such splitting can also be due to finite coupling between the two \\{fe@xmath3}-\\{fe@xmath2 } fragments or due to single - ion anisotropy albeit very weak at that as the @xmath51 configuration of fe@xmath0 has orbital angular momentum approaching @xmath52 , and hence the second order spin - orbit coupling , that commonly induces a single - ion - anisotropy term , is practically negligible , but can not be excluded a priori . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , magnetic frustration that originates from the triangular building blocks of the \\{fe@xmath3 } fragment ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : molecule ] ) although as conjectured settle into a total spin @xmath7 for this cluster,@xcite may yet possess more nuanced excited states as those reported here .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) linewidth of the excitations shown in ( a ) as a function of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a linear fit with parameters included in the figure.,width=2 ]    the pronounced magnetic field dependent excitation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : field2](a ) indicates effectively a second ground state for the system that naturally is attributed to the \\{fe@xmath2 } fragment of the molecule , suggesting the absence or a very weak coupling between the two fragments . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation shifts to higher energies and broadens with the increase in magnetic field , with a peak position that is perfectly linear in magnetic field with a slope that yields a zeeman splitting of an @xmath4 ground state with a @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : field2](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the theoretical ground state of the tri - nuclear \\{fe@xmath2 } fragment with a single exchange coupling among nearest neighbors , namely a doubly degenerate @xmath4 ground state@xcite with small variations from the values obtained by epr measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the close to perfect @xmath54 value is a remarkable result as it is an angular average over any crystalline anisotropy for polycrystalline sample with random crystallographic orientation with respect to the applied magnetic field . a possible explanation to the field dependent linewidth shown in fig .  [ fig : field2](c ) </S>",
    "<S> may be explained by assuming a special @xmath55value anisotropy reported in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> this study reported an effective @xmath5-value that depends on the angle between the external magnetic field and the non - crystallographic @xmath56 axis of the 3-spin triangle such that @xmath57 for @xmath58 perpendicular , and a pair of values @xmath59 and 2.25 for @xmath60 parallel to the @xmath56 axis . for a crystalline with angle @xmath61 between the @xmath56 axis and a field direction we write an effective @xmath5-value @xmath62 , where @xmath63 so that the zeeman splitting for a single crystal is @xmath64\\mu_bh.\\ ] ] averaging over @xmath61 yields a single value at @xmath65 as observed , with a second moment average , i.e. , line - width @xmath66 , linear in @xmath60 as shown fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : field2](b ) . the linear dependence of the fwhm as a function of @xmath60 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : field2](c ) indicates no ( or unresolved ) energy gap close to the ground state that for the perfect \\{fe@xmath2 } triangle consists of a degenerate pair of @xmath67 doublets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior suggests that the @xmath4 ground state is doubly degenerate as expected from a magnetically frustrated triangle@xcite diminishing the possibility of a mutual coupling between the two fragments . </S>",
    "<S> based on the linewidth behavior of the excitations at low magnetic fields , we estimate that any splitting due to the removal of this degeneracy is on the order or less than 5 @xmath19ev . </S>",
    "<S> the first excited state for the perfect @xmath68 \\{fe@xmath2 } with a single afm exchange coupling @xmath69 in a heisenberg hamiltonian , ( @xmath70 ) is a total spin @xmath71 at @xmath72 from the ground state , and based on the value reported for @xmath73 mev@xcite is beyond the energy range available with osiris .    to summarize , high resolution inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the\\{fe@xmath10 } tridiminshed iron icosahedra magnetic molecule yield comprehensive magnetic spectra that provide the necessary benchmark for theoretical development of a complete hamiltonian for this system . </S>",
    "<S> the ins unequivocally shows two sets of ground states , @xmath7 and @xmath4 , that are attributed to the two \\{fe@xmath3 } and \\{fe@xmath2 } fragments of the molecule that may be very weakly coupled . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the degeneracy predicted for the first @xmath8 excited states of the \\{fe@xmath3 } fragment is removed presumably by finite coupling between the fragments or by inherent frustration in the triangular building blocks of the fragment . </S>",
    "<S> our magnetic field dependent results at base temperature reveal a remarkable single @xmath4 ground state with @xmath74 as expected from a perfect equilateral triangle \\{fe@xmath2 } fragment . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a clear near by excited state for the \\{fe@xmath2 } fragment suggests the @xmath4 is doubly degenerate as expected from a frustrated triangular arrangement of half - integer spins@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the two fragments \\{fe@xmath2 } and \\{fe@xmath3 } with triangular building - blocks may shed light on the effect of topological magnetic frustration in magnetic molecules .    </S>",
