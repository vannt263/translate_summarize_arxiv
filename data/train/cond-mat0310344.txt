    "complex networks , as for instance represented by the internet , the social acquaintance network between individuals , biological networks of interacting proteins , and others ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further examples ) , became recently a central research focus in statistical physics .",
    "in general a network consists of a set of nodes  ( sites or vertices ) and a set of edges  ( bonds or arcs ) , connecting the nodes with one another . a system with many interacting degrees of freedom , e.g. , computers , individuals , proteins etc . , or generally called agents , can be modeled by a network by identifying the agents as the nodes and the interaction between them as the edges .",
    "real world networks neither have a regular structure ( as for instance periodic lattices or grid graphs have ) nor a fully random structure @xcite .",
    "they rather display a broad distribution of the degree , where the degree @xmath6 of a node is the number of neighbors connected to it . some networks , the so - called scale - free networks @xcite , display a power - law degree distribution @xmath7 , which is is found in various disciplines .",
    "the heterogeneous structure of scale - free networks has a significant influence on thermodynamic or dynamic systems embedded into them .",
    "for instance , the nature of equilibrium  @xcite or nonequilibrium  @xcite phase transitions are quite different from those observed in corresponding systems on regular periodic lattices . in the present work we are interested in the nature of diffusive and relaxational dynamics performed by a random walker in scale - free hierarchical network  . as a very recent application",
    "we note that in the context of peer - to - peer computer networks random walk search strategies have been proposed @xcite , in which a query message is forwarded to a randomly chosen neighbor at each step until the desired object ( typically a particular data set ) is found . in view of these algorithmic developments",
    "it appears therefore quite natural and important to study random walks on complex networks .",
    "in addition , the random walk is a fundamental stochastic process  @xcite and turns out to be a useful tool in characterizing the structure of complex networks  .    in regular networks of periodic lattices in @xmath8 dimension ,",
    "the random walk motion is characterized by normal diffusion which is characterized by a length scale that grows algebraically as @xmath9 in time @xmath4 .",
    "the exponent @xmath10 is universal , i.e.   it does not depend on the microscopic details of the lattice  the only condition being that only nearest neighbor jumps on a regular @xmath8-dimensional lattice are allowed .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath11 or the return probability to the initial node in @xmath4 time steps decays algebraically as @xmath12 . on random networks ,",
    "on the other hand , the autocorrelation function shows a stretched - exponential decay as @xmath13 with @xmath14  .",
    "random walks were also studied in the small - world network of watts and strogatz  @xcite , which interpolates between regular networks and random networks by stochastically changing connections between nodes with a particular rewiring probability @xmath15 .",
    "in essence a small - world network is obtained from a regular network with edges of fraction @xmath15 being replaced by shortcuts connecting pairs of nodes selected randomly . for nonzero @xmath15 ,",
    "an interesting crossover behavior is observed  @xcite : a random walk obeys the scaling law for regular networks for short times @xmath16 , and then that for the random networks for large times @xmath17 .",
    "the crossover time scale @xmath18 is determined by the time interval at which a random walker hits shortcuts . since the mean distance between shortcuts is @xmath19 , the crossover time scales as @xmath20 . for @xmath17",
    ", it is numerically found that the autocorrelation function also shows a stretched - exponential decay as @xmath21 with @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "there has been a growing interest recently in the study of random walks on scale - free networks  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on random walks on a hierarchical network , which is a model for a scale - free network with a modular structure  . unlike most scale - free network models it is a deterministic network as those of jung _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and dorogovtsev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . due to its deterministic nature a number of characteristic structural features",
    "are known exactly  @xcite . as we will see in the following , we can study various properties of the random walk analytically .",
    "the analytic results will shed light on the stochastic processes in general scale - free networks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the hierarchical network model and the random walk is introduced .",
    "our results for the scaling laws for the relaxation time and the autocorrelation functions are presented in sec .",
    "these results are derived with the help of an exact mapping of the random walk problem to a constrained dynamics of an ising spin chain , the details of which mapping are described in sec .",
    "we also find that a random walk on a hierarchical network is similar to the diffusion in ultrametric space , which is elaborated in sec .",
    "finally we summarize our work in sec .",
    "some biological networks which are scale - free exhibit a modular structure , which is not incorporated into most scale - free network models .",
    "the hierarchical network has been proposed as a model for the scale - free networks with the modular structure  .",
    "it is constructed iteratively starting from a seed  ( first generation ) @xmath23 consisting of a _ hub _ and @xmath24 _ peripheral nodes_. they are fully connected with each other .",
    "it is useful to represent the hub and the peripheral nodes with the coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an integer @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "nodes in @xmath29 , the network of the @xmath30th generation , are identified via coordinates that are @xmath30-tuples of integers @xmath31 .    from a given graph @xmath32 ,",
    "the next generation network @xmath33 is constructed by adding @xmath24 copies of @xmath34 with their peripheral nodes connected to the hub of the original @xmath35 . the original hub and",
    "the peripheral nodes in the copies become the hub and peripheral nodes of @xmath36 , respectively . then",
    ", each node whose coordinate was @xmath37 is assigned to @xmath38 if it belongs to the original @xmath34 or to @xmath39 with @xmath28 if it belongs to the @xmath27th copy of @xmath34 .",
    "so the hub has @xmath40 for all @xmath41 and a peripheral node has @xmath42 for all @xmath41 .",
    "there are @xmath43 nodes in @xmath29 , @xmath44 of which are peripheral nodes .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the configuration and the coordinate representation of @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "the iteration can be repeated indefinitely and the emerging network is scale - free for @xmath47 with the degree distribution exponent @xmath48  @xcite .     with @xmath46 .",
    "the hub is represented with a filled square , and the peripheral nodes are with empty circles . ]",
    "the node connectivity is represented by the adjacency matrix @xmath49 ; @xmath50 if a node @xmath51 is connected to @xmath52 or 0 otherwise . the network is undirected , hence @xmath53 and the connectivity is easily described in terms of the coordinates  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will use @xmath54 for a dummy index from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , while @xmath27 from @xmath57 to @xmath56 , and we denote the @xmath58-tuple of @xmath55 as @xmath59 .",
    "the network growth rule implies * ( a ) * the existence of connections of @xmath58-th generation hub to all @xmath58-th generation peripheral nodes , more precisely in coordinate language : nodes @xmath37 with @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 are connected to the following nodes : @xmath63 with @xmath64 . and",
    "it implies * ( b ) * the existence of connections between peripheral nodes and lower level hubs plus connections to other peripheral nodes within the same elementary unit ; in coordinate language : a node @xmath37 with @xmath65 for @xmath61 and @xmath66 is connected to the following nodes : @xmath67 ( \\cdots 0y_m \\cdots y_{n+1 } { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ 0$}}_n ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    we study a discrete time random walk on the network .",
    "this stochastic process is defined by the following rules : the walker at node @xmath51 and time @xmath4 selects one of the neighbors of @xmath51 to which @xmath51 is connected and jumps to this neighbor at time @xmath70 .",
    "thus the transition probability for a jump from a node @xmath51 to a node @xmath52 is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath49 is the adjacency matrix and @xmath72 is the degree of the node @xmath51 .",
    "this stochastic process in discrete time is described by a master equation for the time evolution of @xmath73 , the probability finding the walker at node @xmath51 and time @xmath4 .",
    "the master equation reads @xmath74 .",
    "equivalently , defining the state vector @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the state in which the walker is at node @xmath51 , one can rewrite the master equation as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the transition operator whose elements are @xmath79 .    in the infinite time limit",
    "@xmath80 the probability distribution converges to the stationary state distribution @xmath81 , which is given by @xmath82 with @xmath83 for the random walk on arbitrary undirected network  . in the hierarchical network",
    "the degree of all nodes are known exactly  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the hub has the largest degree @xmath84 and the peripheral node has the degree @xmath85 the sum of all degrees is given by @xmath86    a quantity of particular interest is the scaling law for the relaxation time @xmath87 , which is the characteristic time scale for the approach of the probability distribution @xmath73 to the stationary state distribution @xmath88 .",
    "also of interest is the nature of the relaxation dynamics , for which we consider the decay of the autocorrelation function @xmath89 which is the overlap between a state @xmath90 with itself after @xmath4 time steps .",
    "when @xmath91 , it reduces to the returning probability of the random walker to the origin  ( starting node ) @xmath51 after @xmath4 time steps . in the limit @xmath80 the autocorrelation function converges to a value determined by the stationary state distribution @xmath92",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath93 for @xmath94 will be studied for various states @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we present our the main results . they are derived using the exact mapping of our random walk process onto a constrained dynamics of an ising spin chain .",
    "details of the mapping and the derivations of the formulas deduced from it and used in the present section are delegated to the next section .",
    "consider the motion of the random walker located initially on a particular node , say @xmath95 .",
    "the memory of the initial position will be lost when all components @xmath96 s are flipped at least once , which defines the relaxation time scale @xmath87 .",
    "the node connectivity summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ z2nz ] ) and ( [ nz2z ] ) tells us that @xmath96 may flip only when all @xmath97 s with @xmath98 are equal to @xmath55  ( if @xmath60 ) or all are not equal to @xmath55  ( if @xmath99 ) .",
    "hence , the random walker should follow the path @xmath100 to loose the memory of its initial state .",
    "each process requires a simultaneous flip of @xmath101 components from zero to nonzero values or vice versa , which may occur after many trials .",
    "for instance , the random walker at @xmath102 may hop to @xmath103 or @xmath104 instead of to @xmath105 .",
    "when it jumps to a wrong node , say @xmath104 , first it should hop to a node @xmath106 , and then try another hopping toward the destination . in this respect",
    "the dynamics we are considering is of a hierarchical nature . utilizing this observation we will show in the next section that the associated time scale @xmath107 for the process increases exponentially as @xmath108 .",
    "we define @xmath109 for further use .",
    "therefore , the relaxation time @xmath87 , which is given by @xmath110 , scales _ exponentially _ with @xmath30 as @xmath111 since @xmath112 , the relaxation time scales _ algebraically _ with @xmath0 as @xmath113 with the dynamic exponent @xmath114      to be specific we consider the autocorrelation functions for the following states :    1 .",
    "@xmath115 is the state corresponding to the hub @xmath116 is the state corresponding to the peripheral nodes @xmath117 3 .",
    "@xmath118 and @xmath119 are the states @xmath120 with zero and nonzero components alternating .",
    "the stationary state probability distribution is determined by the degree distribution . since the degree of all nodes is known , it is easy to show that @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 in the large @xmath30 limit .",
    "the exponential decrease of the stationary state probability and the exponential increase of the relaxation time suggests a power - law decay of the autocorrelation function in time .",
    "indeed , we find that the autocorrelation functions decay algebraically for @xmath94 as @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "quite remarkably , the decay exponent depends on the state  a manifestation of the fact that the network under consideration is not homogeneous .",
    "in addition to the power - law dependency in @xmath4 , the functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 also decay as @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively , i.e.  algebraically with the number of generations in the network .",
    "so , the power - law decay in time is observed only in finite systems for the states @xmath115 and @xmath134 , since in the limit @xmath135 the functions @xmath136 and @xmath137 vanish .",
    "in this section , we explain the exact mapping of the random walk problem onto the constrained dynamics of an ising spin chain .      using the coordinate representation of the nodes ,",
    "one may map the state @xmath76 with a random walker at a node @xmath138 in @xmath139 to a spin configuration @xmath140 of an @xmath141-state potts spin chain of length @xmath30 , where @xmath142 denotes the state of the spin at site @xmath41 ( @xmath143 ) in the chain .",
    "a jump of the walker corresponds to a transition between spin configuration . in this way",
    "the connection rules define the time evolution of the spins .    in the context of spin dynamics ,",
    "it is useful to define a _ zero domain _  ( zd ) and a _ nonzero domain _  ( nzd ) ; the zd is a domain of spins that are all in the zero - state , i.e.@xmath144 ; and the nzd is one in which all spins are in a non - zero state .",
    "in particular , a domain including the spin @xmath145 will be called a _ boundary domain_. the node connectivity imposes the constraint that spins outside the boundary domain can not flip in a given spin configuration .",
    "so it suffices to consider the transition of spins in the boundary domain .",
    "equation  ( [ z2nz ] ) implies that spins in a boundary zd evolve in one time step according to @xmath146 with @xmath147 . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ nz2z ] ) implies that spins in a boundary nzd evolve as @xmath148 with @xmath149 .",
    "note that the boundary domain size decreases in most cases .",
    "it increases only when all spins in the boundary domain flip .",
    "the operator @xmath78 is symmetric under any permutation @xmath150 among nonzero spin states .",
    "taking advantage of the symmetry , we restrict ourselves to the subspace which is invariant under all such permutations .",
    "the subspace is spanned by the states @xmath151 and latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     @xmath45 with @xmath46 as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , @xmath153 corresponds to the state with the walker at the hub , and the states @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 correspond to the states in which the walker can be found with equal probability on nodes @xmath157 s , @xmath158 s , and @xmath159 s , respectively .",
    "one may regard the two - state variable @xmath160 as the ising spin .",
    "then the random walk problem in the subspace reduces to an * ising spin chain * with a particular constrained dynamics .",
    "in fact , the state defined in the previous section are equal to the ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered states : @xmath161 of up / down spins of size @xmath58 evolves in one time step according to @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "each spin state has a different multiplicity factor , so the transition probabilities @xmath165 and @xmath166 are not uniform in @xmath41 .",
    "note that the spin up - down symmetry is broken for @xmath47 .",
    "it is restored for @xmath167 , in which case the corresponding network is not scale - free .    .",
    "solid  ( dashed ) lines with the arrow represent the transition with the probability @xmath166  ( @xmath165 ) , where @xmath58 is the boundary domain size of a source state and @xmath41 is the number of flipped spins .",
    "self - loops from states with a @xmath168 boundary domain to themselves with weights @xmath169 are omitted .",
    "the parts inside the boxes with @xmath170 being ignored are equivalent to the configuration space of @xmath171 ; the configuration space has a hierarchical structure . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we illustrate a diagram of the configuration space of the spin chain of length @xmath172 displaying the spin configurations and possible transitions between them .",
    "qualitative features of the ising spin dynamics are easily read off from the diagram : ( i ) the configuration space has a tree structure , if one ignores self - loops from the states with a @xmath168 boundary domain to themselves  ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "( ii ) the configuration space has a hierarchical structure , that is , the configuration space of @xmath29 contains those of @xmath174 with @xmath175 as parts  ( see figure .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the condition that only spins in a boundary domain may flip imposes severe constraint on the spin relaxation dynamics . in a given ising spin configuration , @xmath176 may flip after @xmath177 aligns parallel to it , @xmath178 may flip after @xmath177 and @xmath176 align parallel to it , and then , in general , @xmath179 may flip after all spins @xmath180 with @xmath181 align parallel to it .",
    "in other words , the boundary domain size grows up to @xmath58 in order to flip @xmath179 .",
    "the boundary domain growth is the essential mechanism in the spin relaxation dynamics . in the language of a domain wall ,",
    "a domain wall at site @xmath182 , i.e. , @xmath183 , plays a role of a dynamic barrier since it prevents spins @xmath184 with @xmath185 from flipping .",
    "consider a spin configuration with a boundary domain of size @xmath58 .",
    "the size of the boundary domain increases only when all @xmath58 spins inside the domain flip simultaneously .",
    "when @xmath181 spins flip , the boundary domain size reduces to @xmath41 .",
    "then the spin system should grow the boundary domain size up to @xmath58 to return to the initial state and try another flip to increase the boundary domain size .",
    "it shows that the boundary growth process has a hierarchical nature , which is inherited from to the hierarchical structure of the configuration space .",
    "we investigate the characteristic time scale associated with the boundary domain growth process . due to the hierarchical nature of the dynamics",
    ", we find that the time scale satisfies a recursion relation . to be more specific , we consider the mean first passage time  ( mfpt ) @xmath186  ( @xmath187 ) , which it takes to flip all spins in the boundary domain of @xmath58 up  ( down ) spins simultaneously for the first time .",
    "note that such time scales do not depend on spins outside the boundary domain , so they do not depend on the total chain length @xmath30 .        before proceeding ,",
    "we derive a useful formula for the mfpt in a _ tree - like _ structure . consider a node  ( or state )",
    "@xmath188 which is connected to @xmath189 nodes @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "the transition probability from @xmath188 to @xmath190 is given by @xmath192 , and to itself by @xmath193  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . by the tree - like structure ,",
    "we mean that @xmath190 can be reached from @xmath194 only through @xmath188 for all pairs of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , no matter how many loops there are in the shaded areas .",
    "then , @xmath195 , the mfpt from @xmath188 to @xmath190 , is given by @xmath196 where @xmath197 denotes the mfpt from @xmath194 to @xmath188 and @xmath198 is set to zero .",
    "the first term corresponds to the transition to @xmath190 in a single step , the second term to a round trip via @xmath199 or staying at @xmath188 followed by the transition to @xmath190 , and so on .",
    "the infinite sum can easily be evaluated which yields @xmath200    the configuration space of the ising spin chain has a tree structure .",
    "so we can make use of the formula in eq .",
    "( [ formal_t ] ) .",
    "take a spin state with a boundary domain of @xmath58 up spins as @xmath188 in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is connected to spin states with boundary domains of @xmath41 down spins ( @xmath201 ) with the transition probabilities @xmath165 , which leads to @xmath202 likewise , one also obtains that @xmath203 after lengthy but straightforward calculations , the recursion relations can be solved exactly to yield @xmath204 for @xmath205 and @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",

    "the spin system loses the memory of the initial state when all spins flip at least once .",
    "note that @xmath215 is the last spin to flip .",
    "so , the characteristic relaxation time is given by the time at which @xmath215 flips for the first time .",
    "it can flip when all spins align ferromagnetically , which requires that spins @xmath216 align , which also requires that spins @xmath217 align , and so on . therefore the relaxation time is given by @xmath218 .",

    "the sum is dominated by the last term @xmath222 for all spin states .",
    "therefore we conclude that the characteristic relaxation time averaged over all states scales as @xmath223 , which gives @xmath224 , i.e.  the important formulas in eqs .",

    "the spin system loses the memory as more and more spins fluctuate . due to the hierarchical nature of the spin dynamics",
    ", the spin fluctuations grow from one boundary of the chain , namely , from @xmath177 .",
    "so , it is useful to define a length scale @xmath226 which is determined by the condition that @xmath227 for @xmath228 and @xmath229 , where @xmath230 denotes the spin state at time @xmath4 .",
    "all spins at sites @xmath231 have flipped at least once up to @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , we will call those sites the _ perturbed domain _ , and @xmath101 the _ perturbed domain size_. roughly speaking , @xmath226 is the maximum size of the boundary domain up to time @xmath4 .",

    "the state @xmath232 has the highest density of domain walls .",

    "the solid lines have the slope @xmath281 . ]",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath130 and @xmath131 is also confirmed via the numerical simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show a plot of the autocorrelation function evaluated in the ising spin chain of length @xmath282 with @xmath46 . as @xmath30 increases , the decay follows the power law in @xmath4 with the exponent @xmath281 .",
    "we also checked that the power - law scaling regime overlaps in the plots of @xmath283 and @xmath284 vs @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to generalize the argument for the autocorrelation function to an arbitrary state @xmath209 whose stationary state probability scales as @xmath285 .",
    "since the perturbed domain size grows in time as @xmath286 , the value of @xmath225 at @xmath287 is given by the stationary state probability for the spin configuration @xmath288 in the chain of length @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath289 .",
    "eliminating @xmath101 , one obtains that @xmath290 with a state - dependent exponent @xmath291  @xcite .",
    "the stationary state distribution is determined by the degree distribution .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the non - universality ( i.e.  state dependence ) of the decay exponent is a consequence of the broad distribution of the degree in the underlying network .",
    "in the preceding sections it turned out that the origin for the power - law decay of the autocorrelation functions is the hierarchical organization of the configuration space ; the spins  ( or the random walker ) overcome the dynamic barriers successively expanding the number of accessible configurations .",
    "we note that this phenomenon is very similar to the one observed in the diffusion in an ultrametric space  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we compare ultrametric diffusion with the random walk problem we have studied in this paper .",
    "consider a dynamical system with @xmath0 states @xmath292 .",
    "the system in state @xmath293 may perform transitions to any other state @xmath294 with a transition probability @xmath295 .",
    "one can define the distance between two states as @xmath296 and thus provide the state space with a metric .",
    "if the transition probabilities satisfy the relation @xmath297 for all @xmath293 , @xmath294 , and @xmath298 , the corresponding metric is called an _",
    "ultrametric _ and the state space is an ultrametric space .",
    "the simplest example of an ultrametric space is represented by a rooted tree generated as follows : we start from a single vertex at the @xmath299th hierarchy and branch @xmath300 vertices in the next @xmath301th hierarchy .",
    "each of them branches into @xmath300 vertices .",
    "it is repeated until one has @xmath302 vertices at the zeroth or bottom level .",
    "one then associates the vertices at the bottom level with the @xmath0 states .",
    "the transition probabilities between two states are assigned to @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is a constant and @xmath305 is the _ hierarchical distance _ between them , namely the hierarchy level of their common ancestor at the lowest level .",
    "it is easy to see that the transition probabilities satisfy the ultrametric relation , and thus an ultrametric space of @xmath0 states is obtained . as an example , we illustrate in fig .  [ fig6 ] the rooted tree with @xmath306 and @xmath307 for an ultrametric space of @xmath308 states . in this example , two states @xmath57 and @xmath309 have the common ancestors at the hierarchy level @xmath310 and @xmath311 , hence @xmath312 , while @xmath313 .",
    "the autocorrelation function can be calculated exactly , see e.g. , ref .",
    "the exact result is also understood with a simple scaling argument .",
    "suppose that the system is in a state @xmath293 initially .",
    "since the transition probability to a state at the hierarchical distance @xmath101 is given by @xmath314 and there are @xmath315 such states , it takes @xmath316 time steps for the system to reach one of the states within the hierarchical distance @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the autocorrelation function at time @xmath317 is given by @xmath318 .",
    "eliminating @xmath101 , one obtains that the autocorrelation function decays algebraically as @xmath319 with @xmath320 .",
    "the power - law decay is valid for @xmath321 , while the dynamics is unstable for @xmath322 . at the marginal case ,",
    "a stretched exponential decay @xmath323 may occur when the transition probability decreases as @xmath324 with the hierarchical distance  @xcite .",
    "comparing the phenomenology , it is clear that the diffusion in the hierarchical network is essentially the same as the ultrametric diffusion . in both processes ,",
    "the relaxation takes place by overcoming dynamic barriers successively and increasing associated length scale .",
    "the length scale corresponds to the perturbed domain size @xmath325 in the former , and to the hierarchical distance @xmath326 in the latter .",
    "the length scale grows logarithmically in time , which is a consequence of the exponential increase of the dynamical barrier height .    note , however , that the diffusion in the hierarchical network is not the ultrametric diffusion in a strict sense since the ultrametric relations are not valid .",
    "the configuration space of the ising spin system has a tree structure with _ all vertices _ corresponding to physical states .",
    "the ultrametricity would hold only if vertices at the bottom hierarchy would represent physical states , see figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "such a difference does not modify the ultrametric nature of the relaxation from the state @xmath232 and @xmath233 , which are located at the end branch in the configuration space . on the other hand ,",
    "the relaxation from @xmath269 and @xmath252 , which are in the center of the configuration space tree , are influenced by the non - ultrametricity .",
    "it is reflected in the @xmath327 and @xmath328 factors in the autocorrelation functions @xmath329 and @xmath330 , respectively .",
    "pseudo - ultrametric diffusion is also observed for the random walks on a tree structure  @xcite and on the one - dimensional lattice with hierarchically distributed dynamic barriers  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the random walk problem on the hierarchical network .",
    "the random walk problem on the network of @xmath331 nodes is mapped to a specially constrained dynamics of a @xmath141-state potts spin chain of length @xmath30 . using the symmetry property ,",
    "it is further mapped to a specially constrained dynamics of an ising spin chain . from the analysis of the mfpt",
    ", it is shown that the characteristic relaxation time scales as @xmath332 with @xmath208 and @xmath333 .",
    "it is also shown that the autocorrelation function decays algebraically in time as @xmath334 for @xmath94 with a non - universal ( i.e.  state - dependent ) exponent @xmath335 .",
    "the power - law scaling behavior is closely related to the ultrametric diffusion .",
    "the exponent is given by @xmath336 for a state @xmath337 whose stationary state probability is @xmath338 .",
    "the stationary state probability is determined from the degree of the corresponding nodes in the network .",
    "the broad distribution of the degree gives rise to the non - universality ( state - dependency ) of the decay exponent .",
    "the power - law decay of the autocorrelation functions appears in marked contrast to the stretched - exponential decay in random networks   and in the small - world networks  @xcite . in order to investigate the origin of the emergence of the power - law scaling",
    ", we have also studied the random walks on the hierarchical networks with @xmath167 . at @xmath167 , the hierarchical network is not scale - free any more .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the same mapping to the ising spin system with the configuration space of the same tree structure .",
    "so we can obtain the scaling behaviors of the relaxation time @xmath87 using eqs .",
    "( [ t+- ] ) and ( [ t-+ ] ) , and of the autocorrelation function using the same scaling arguments : the relaxation time scales as @xmath339 .",
    "and the autocorrelation functions decay algebraically in time with the _ universal _ ( state - independent ) exponent , i.e. , @xmath340 . for @xmath167 ,",
    "the corresponding spin dynamics has the spin up - down symmetry .",
    "so , @xmath131 and @xmath130 decay in the same way as @xmath341 with the same dependency on @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the scaling behavior of the relaxation time and the autocorrelation functions was confirmed numerically .    comparing the results for @xmath167 and @xmath342 ,",
    "we conclude that the power - law scaling behavior of the relaxation time and the autocorrelation functions has its origin in the tree structure of the spin configuration space as shown in fig .",
    "we also conclude that the non - universality of the decay exponent for @xmath342 results from the scale - free degree distribution .",
    "the hierarchical network itself does not have a tree structure .",
    "but , after the mapping , the random walk problem on the network reduces to that on the tree structure . in general",
    ", it is not known _ a priori _ whether such a mapping exists for an arbitrary network",
    ". it would be interesting to study the random walk problem on general networks in order to scrutinize the robustness of the power - law scaling behavior and the effect of the scale - free degree distribution on the relaxation dynamics .",
    "such work is actually in progress .",
    "we note that the very slow relaxation dynamics of the ising chain representation of the random walk problem on the hierarchical network is due to the severe constraints of the dynamics imposed by the restrictions for possible transitions . constrained dynamics in otherwise ( for instance thermodynamically ) very simple models lead quite frequently to a slow or _ glassy _",
    "dynamics @xcite , for which reason kinetically constrained models are often used as models for the dynamics in glasses and spin glasses .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a model also occurs in the context of diffusion in complex networks as we have demonstrated in this work .",
