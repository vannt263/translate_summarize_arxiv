    "in order to make this result compatible with deninger s description of the gamma factors of @xmath4-functions as regularized determinants and with consani s archimedean cohomology @xcite , this formulation of manin was reinterpreted in terms of noncommutative geometry by consani ",
    "marcolli @xcite .",
    "in particular , the model proposed in @xcite for the  fibre at infinity \" uses a noncommutative space which describes the action of the schottky group @xmath5 on its limit set @xmath6 via the crossed product @xmath1-algebra @xmath7 .",
    "this is a particular case of a cuntz ",
    "krieger algebra given by the graph @xmath1-algebra of the finite graph @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the cayley graph of @xmath10 .",
    "following the same analogy between schottky uniformization of riemann surfaces and @xmath0-adic uniformization of mumford curves , consani and marcolli extended their construction @xcite to the case of mumford curves , @xcite .",
    "more interesting graph @xmath1-algebras appear in the @xmath0-adic case than in the archimedean setting , namely the ones associated to the graph @xmath8 , which is the dual graph of the specialization of the mumford curve and to @xmath11 , which is the dual graph of the closed fibre of the minimal smooth model of the curve .",
    "after these results of consani  marcolli , the construction was further refined in @xcite and extended to some classes of higher rank buildings generalizing the rank - one case of schottky groups acting on bruhat  tits trees .",
    "the relation between schottky uniformizations , noncommutative geometry , and graph @xmath1-algebras was further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the main question in this approach is how much of the algebraic geometry of mumford curves can be recovered by means of the noncommutative geometry of certain @xmath1-algebras associated to the action of the schottky group on the bruhat ",
    "tits tree , on its limit set , and on the drinfeld upper half plane , and conversely how much the noncommutative geometry is determined by algebro - geometric information coming from the mumford curve .    in this paper",
    "we analyze another aspect of this question , based on recent results on circle actions on graph @xmath1-algebras and associated kms states and modular index theory , @xcite .",
    "in particular , we first show how numerical information like the schottky invariants given by the translation lengths of a given set of generators of the schottky group can be recovered from the modular index invariants of the graph @xmath1-algebra determined by the action of the @xmath0-adic schottky group on the bruhat ",
    "tits tree .",
    "we then analyze the relation between graph weights for this same graph @xmath1-algebra and theta functions of the mumford curve . unlike the previous results on mumford curves and noncommutative geometry , which concentrated on the use of the graph @xmath1-algebra associated to the _ finite _ graph @xmath11 or @xmath8 , here we use the full infinite graph @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bruhat  tits tree , with boundary at infinity @xmath14 , the @xmath15-points of the mumford curve , with @xmath15 a finite extension of @xmath16 .",
    "the fact of working with an infinite graph requires a more subtle analysis of the modular index theory and a setting for the graph weights , where the main information is located inside the finite graph @xmath11 and is propagated along the infinite trees in @xmath12 attached to the vertices of @xmath11 , towards the conformal boundary @xmath17 .",
    "the graph weights are solutions of a combinatorial equation at the vertices of the graph , which can be thought of as governing a momentum flow through the graph .",
    "we prove that for graphs such as @xmath12 faithful graph weights are the same as gauge invariant , norm lower semicontinuous faithful semifinite functionals on the graph @xmath1-algebra .",
    "this is the basis for constructing kms states associated to graph weights , which are then used to compute modular index invariants for these type iii geometries .",
    "the theta functions of mumford curves in turn can be described as in @xcite in terms of @xmath5-invariant currents on the bruhat ",
    "tits tree @xmath13 and corresponding signed measures of total mass zero on the boundary .",
    "we show that this description of theta functions leads to an inhomogeneous version of the equation defining graph weights , or equivalently to a homogeneous version , but where the weights are allowed to have a sign instead of being positive and are also required to be integer valued .",
    "we also show that there is an isomorphism between the abelian group of @xmath5-invariant currents on the bruhat - tits tree and linear functionals on the @xmath18 of the graph @xmath1-algebra of the quotient graph @xmath19 .",
    "this implies that theta functions of the mumford curve define functionals on the @xmath20-theory of the graph algebra , with the only ambiguity given by the action of @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we discuss how to use the spectral flow to construct solutions of the inhomogeneous graph weights equations and how to use these to construct theta functions in case where one has more than one ( positive ) graph weight on @xmath12 .",
    "it would be interesting , in a similar manner , to explore how other invariants associated to type iii noncommutative geometries , such as the approach followed by connes ",

    "the results of this section relate the theta functions of mumford curves to the @xmath20-theory of a @xmath1-algebra which is not directly the graph algebra @xmath19 we worked with so far , but the `` boundary algebra '' @xmath841 .",
    "however , it is known by the result of theorem  1.2 of @xcite that the crossed product algebra @xmath796 is strongly morita equivalent to the algebra @xmath19 . in fact",
    ", we use the fact that @xmath13 is a tree and that the @xmath0-adic schottky group @xmath5 acts freely on @xmath13 , so that @xmath842 . thus @xmath19 is strongly morita equivalent to @xmath843 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 is the universal covering tree of @xmath12 and @xmath5 can be identified with the fundamental group so that the argument of theorem 4.13 of @xcite holds in this case and the result of theorem  1.2 of @xcite applies .",
    "thus the @xmath20-theory considered here can be also thought of as the @xmath20-theory of the latter algebra and we obtain the following result .    [ thetak ] a theta function @xmath699 defines a functional @xmath844 .",
    "two theta functions @xmath845 define the same @xmath846 if and only if they differ by the action of @xmath21 .",

    "the second statement is then a direct consequence of proposition [ thetakth ] and .",
    "corollary [ thetak ] shows that there is a close relationship between the @xmath20-homology of @xmath19 and theta functions . in the next section",
    "we make a first step towards constructing theta functions from graphical data and spectral flows .",

    "we would like to construct an inhomogenous graph weight @xmath848 from these data .",
    "the motivation for the construction is as follows . in the case of a special graph weight",
    ", the spectral flow only sees edges and paths in the zhyvot @xmath151 of @xmath92 .",
    "consequently @xmath849 thus in some sense the spectral flow is trying to reproduce the graph weight , but misses information from edges not in @xmath151 .",
    "alternatively , one may think of restricting @xmath313 to the zhyvot and asking whether it is still a ( special ) graph weight .",
    "this is usually not the case , for exactly the same reason .",
    "so to obtain @xmath848 we begin with the ansatz that @xmath324 is the function given to us with our graph weight and that @xmath850 so that we require @xmath851 for all @xmath852 .",
    "we now compute @xmath853 hence to obtain an inhomogenous graph weight , we must have @xmath854 here are some possible choices of @xmath855 .",

    "however , 3 ) is more subtle . at present",
    "we have no way of deciding whether we can always find a @xmath607 so that the function @xmath855 in 3 ) is non - negative for @xmath324 associated to the zhyvot action .",
    "it would seem that passing to field extensions allows us to construct graph weights adapted to the ( new ) zhyvot so that both 3 ) and 4 ) fail .",
    "the reason is we may increase @xmath710 while keeping @xmath708 constant .",
    "we describe here another construction of inhomogenous graph weights adapted to the zhyvot action .",
    "this uses special graph weights , with @xmath868 only on the edges inside the zhyvot , so it does not apply to the construction of theta functions , where one needs @xmath737 ( which is @xmath869 outside of the zhyvot ) , but we include it here for its independent interest .",
