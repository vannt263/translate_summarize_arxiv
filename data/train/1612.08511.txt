    "first three compounds la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath2 , pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath2 and rusr@xmath8gdcu@xmath8 show that @xmath0 decreases upon the isotope substitution @xmath9o@xmath10o . the isotope shift of @xmath0 for zrzn@xmath8 was not determined because the shift of @xmath0 is very small and there was uncertainty arising from different impurity levels .",
    "the compound srruo@xmath2 exhibits a positive isotope shift , that is , @xmath0 increases upon @xmath11o isotope substitution .",
    "we think that mechanisms of the isotope effect for the first three materials and the last one srruo@xmath2 are different .",
    "the large curie temperature shift @xmath0(@xmath9o ) = 222.7k to @xmath0(@xmath11o ) = 202.0k was reported when @xmath12 for la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath2@xcite .",
    "we consider that this shift is caused by strong electron - lattice coupling with some relation to large magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "there is a suggestion that the ferromagnetic transition is caused by the double - exchange interaction@xcite and a strong electron - lattice interaction originating from the jahn - teller effect@xcite .",
    "pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath2 is also a member of materials that exhibit the colossal magnetoresistance phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the curie temperature was lowered due to the isotope substitution @xmath9o@xmath13@xmath11o ; @xmath0(@xmath9o ) = 112k is shifted to @xmath0(@xmath11o ) = 106k when @xmath14 .",
    "it is expected that the isotope effect arises from the same mechanism as for la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath2@xcite .    as for strontium ruthenates ,",
    "raman spectra of srruo@xmath2 films showed anomalous temperature dependence near the ferromagnetic transition temperature@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the electron - phonon interaction plays a role in srruo@xmath2 .",
    "recently , the isotope effect of the curie temperature @xmath0 has been reported in srruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "this material is an itinerant ferromagnet with @xmath15k .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature was increased about 1k upon @xmath11o isotope substitution .",
    "a softening of the oxygen vibration modes is induced by the isotope substitution ( @xmath9o@xmath13@xmath11o ) .",
    "this was clearly indicated by raman spectroscopy .",
    "the raman spectroscopy also confirmed that almost all the oxygen atoms ( more than 80 percent ) were substituted successfully .",
    "the increase of the atomic mass leads to a decrease of the debye frequency @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , the raman spectra clearly indicate that the main vibration frequency of @xmath9o at 372@xmath17 is lowered to 351@xmath17 for @xmath11o by oxygen isotope substitution in srruo@xmath2 .",
    "this shift is consistent with the formula @xmath18 where @xmath1 is the mass of an oxgen atom .",
    "thus , experiments confirmed that the isotope shift of @xmath0 is induced by the decrease of the frequency of the oxygen vibration mode .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the isotope shift of the curie temperature theoretically .",

    ", we examine the corrections to the ferromagnetic state due to the electron - phonon interaction , by examining the ladder , self - energy and vertex corrections . in the section 5 ,",
    "we calculate the oxygen - isotope shift of @xmath19 on the basis of the spin - fluctuation theory .",
    "we show that the both theories give consistent results on the isotope effect .",
    "the reduction of the debye frequency results in the increase of relative strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath20 .",
    "this results in a positive isotope shift of @xmath19 .",
    "this is a picture that indicates the positive isotope shift of @xmath0 ; @xmath21 .",
    "we start from the hubbard model with the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath20 to describe a ferromagnetic state .",
    "the curie temperature @xmath0 is determined by the gap equation .",
    "the effective attractive interaction due to the phonon exchange reduces @xmath20 to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) in the neighborhood of the fermi surface .",
    "the effective attraction , however , shows no isotope shift in the stoner theory because the curie temperature is determined by the interaction at the fermi surface and then the variation of @xmath16 has no effect on @xmath0 .",
    "the electron - phonon vertex correction reduces the magnetization and this leads to the isotope effect .",
    "although the vertex correction is on order of @xmath24 , for the debye frequency @xmath16 and the fermi energy @xmath25 , the isotope effect can be observed by precise measurements when the curie temperature is as large as 100k or more than that .",
    "the isotope effect in itinerant ferromagnets was first investigated on the basis of the stoner theory in ref.@xcite , and the formula for isotope coefficient @xmath26 was given . a fluctuation effect , however , is not included in the stoner theory .",

    "we present the formula of the isotope coefficient on the basis of the spin - fluctuation theory , and show that the isotope effect observed by experiments is consistent with this formula .",
