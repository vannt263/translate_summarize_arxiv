    "in the late 1980s the idea of using _ argumentation _ to model nonmonotonic reasoning emerged ( see @xcite as well as @xcite for excellent overviews ) . nowadays argumentation theory is a vibrant subfield of artificial intelligence , covering aspects of knowledge representation , multi - agent systems , and also philosophical questions . among other approaches which have been proposed for capturing representative patterns of inference in argumentation theory @xcite , dung",
    "s abstract argumentation frameworks ( afs ) @xcite play an important role within this research area . at the heart of dung s",
    "approach lie the so - called _ argumentation semantics _",
    "@xcite for an excellent overview ) . given an af @xmath0 , which is set - theoretically just a directed graph encoding arguments and attacks between them , a certain argumentation semantics @xmath1 returns acceptable sets of arguments @xmath2 , so - called @xmath1-_extensions_. each of these sets represents a reasonable position w.r.t .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 .    over the last 20 years a series of abstract argumentation semantics were introduced .",
    "the motivations of these semantics range from the desired treatment of specific examples to fulfilling a number of abstract principles .",
    "the comparison via abstract criteria of the different semantics available is a topic which emerged quite recently in the community ( @xcite can be seen as the first paper in this line ) .",
    "our work takes a further step towards a comprehensive understanding of argumentation semantics .",
    "in particular , we study the following question : do we really need the entire af @xmath0 to compute a certain argumentation semantics @xmath1 ?",
    "in other words , is it possible to unambiguously determine acceptable sets w.r.t .",
    "@xmath1 , given only partial information of the underlying framework @xmath0 . in order to solve this problem let us start with the following reflections :    1 .   as a matter of fact , one basic requirement of almost all existing semantics",
    "is that of conflict - freeness , i.e. arguments within a reasonable position are not allowed to attack each other .",
    "consequently , knowledge about conflict - free sets is an essential part for computing semantics .",
    "2 .   the second step is to ask the following : which information on top on conflict - free sets has to be added ?",
    "imagine the set of conflict - free sets given by @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , there has to be at least one attack between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , this information is not sufficient to compute any standard semantics ( except naive extensions , which are defined as @xmath6-maximal conflict - free sets ) since we know nothing precise about the neighborhood of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the following three afs possess exactly the mentioned conflict - free sets , but differ with respect to other + ( a1 ) at ( -0.6,0 ) [ circle , thick , draw , label = left:@xmath7@xmath4 ; ( b1 ) at ( 0.4,0 ) [ circle , thick , draw]@xmath5 ; + ( a2 ) at ( 2,0 ) [ circle , thick , draw , label = left:@xmath8 @xmath4 ; ( b2 ) at ( 3.0,0 ) [ circle , thick , draw ] @xmath5 ; + ( a3 ) at ( 4.6,0 ) [ circle , thick , draw , label = left:@xmath9 @xmath4 ; ( b3 ) at ( 5.6,0 ) [ circle , thick , draw ] @xmath5 ; + ( a1 ) to [ thick , bend right ] ( b1 ) ; ( b2 ) to [ thick , bend right ] ( a2 ) ; ( a3 ) to [ thick , bend right ] ( b3 ) ; ( b3 ) to [ thick , bend right ] ( a3 ) ; 3 .",
    "the final step is to try to minimize the added information .",
    "that is , which kind of knowledge about the neighborhood is somehow dispensable in the light of computation ?",
    "clearly , this will depend on the considered semantics .",
    "for instance , in case of stage semantics @xcite , which requests conflict - free sets of maximal range , we do not need any information about incoming attacks .",
    "this information can not be omitted in case of admissible - based semantics since incoming attacks require counterattacks .",
    "the above considerations motivate the introduction of so - called verification classes specifying a certain amount of information . in a first step ,",
    "we study the relation of these classes to each other . we therefore introduce the notion of being _ more informative _ capturing the intuition that a certain class can reproduce the information of an other .",
    "we present a hierarchy w.r.t .  this ordering .",
    "the hierarchy contains 15 different verification classes only .",
    "this is due to the fact that many syntactically different classes collapse to the same amount of information .",
    "we then formally define the essential property of a semantics @xmath1 being _ verifiable _ w.r.t .  a certain verification class .",
    "we present a general theorem stating that any _ rational _ semantics is exactly verifiable w.r.t .",
    "one of the @xmath10 different verification classes . roughly speaking ,",
    "a semantics is rational if attacks inbetween two self - loops can be omitted without affecting the set of extensions .",
    "an important aside hereby is that even the most informative class contains indeed less information than the entire framework by itself .",
    "in this paper we consider a representative set of standard semantics .",
    "all of them satisfy rationality and thus , are exactly verifiable w.r.t .  a certain class .",
    "since the theorem does not provide an answer to which verification class perfectly matches a certain rational semantics we study this problem one by one for any considered semantics . as a result , only @xmath11 different classes are essential to classify the considered standard semantics .    in the last part of the paper we study an application of the concept of verifiability .",
    "more precisely , we address the question of strong equivalence for semantics lying inbetween known semantics , so - called intermediate semantics .",
    "strong equivalence is the natural counterpart to ordinary equivalence in monotonic theories ( see @xcite for abstract argumentation and @xcite for other nonmonotonic theories ) .",
    "we provide characterization theorems relying on the notion of verifiability and thus , contributing to a more abstract understanding of the different features argumentation semantics offer . besides these main results",
    ", we also give new characterizations for strong equivalence with respect to naive extensions and strong admissible sets .",
    "an _ argumentation framework _ ( af ) @xmath12 is a directed graph whose nodes @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 being an infinite set of arguments , so - called _ universe _ ) are interpreted as _",
    "arguments _ and whose edges @xmath15 represent _ conflicts _ between them .",
    "we assume that all afs possess finitely many arguments only and denote the collection of all afs by @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 we say that @xmath4 _ attacks _ @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , we write @xmath18 as well as , for some @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 if there is some @xmath22 attacked by @xmath4 or attacking @xmath5 , respectively .",
