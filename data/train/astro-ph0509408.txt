    "most of our knowledge about the masses of the progenitors to neutron stars is based on theoretical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "quantitative observational constraints are difficult to establish .",
    "the few previous , tentative estimates have relied on inferring these masses from traces of the interactions of the progenitors with their surroundings @xcite , on developing scenarios by which individual accreting x - ray binaries could have formed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or on demonstrating that the progenitor was a member of a population of coeval stars with well - determined masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first two methods remain uncertain because of their dependence on assumptions in the relevant models .",
    "the third class of results are potentially the most reliable , although there is sometimes debate over the whether the neutron stars and the stellar associations are related ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we report the discovery of a neutron star in _ chandra",
    "_  observations of the galactic star cluster westerlund 1 .",
    "the cluster contains an exceptional population of @xmath950 massive , post - main - sequence stars that are only 4@xmath131 myr old @xcite .",
    "its total mass of @xmath9@xmath14@xmath10  is contained in a region only @xmath129 pc across , which suggests that the stars were born in a single episode of star formation @xcite .",
    "this makes it an ideal cluster for placing limits on the initial masses of progenitors to compact objects .",
    "we observed westerlund 1 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ advanced ccd spectrometer spectroscopic array ( acis - s)@xcite on two occasions : 2005 may 22 for 18 ks ( sequence 5411 ) and 2005 june 18 for 42 ks ( sequence 6283 ) .",
    "the event lists were reduced using the standard tools and techniques described on the web site of the _ chandra x - ray center _ ( cxc ) .",
    "we used the wavelet - based algorithm wavdetect @xcite to identify 238 individual point - like x - ray sources in the entire image ( which covered approximately four times the area displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : img ] ) .",
    "half of these sources are located in the central portion of the image shown . above our completeness limit of @xmath15  ph",
    "@xmath16 s@xmath1  ( 0.58.0 kev ) , we find that the central surface density of x - ray sources is @xmath17 arcmin@xmath18 .",
    "for comparison , observations of the galactic plane at @xmath19 and @xmath20 reveal only 0.17@xmath130.04 sources arcmin@xmath18 at this flux level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the surface density of sources can be modeled as a lorentzian function with half - width @xmath21@xmath13@xmath22 arcmin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] ) . therefore , even without considering the properties of individual x - ray sources , any one located within 17 of the core of westerlund 1 has a @xmath990% chance of being a cluster member .",
    "most of the x - ray sources have wolf - rayet or o ( wr / o ) stars as counterparts in optical or infrared images , and are probably colliding - wind binaries . however , some of the wr / o stars could be in binaries with accreting compact objects , and x - ray sources without obvious stellar counterparts could be isolated pulsars .",
    "we did not find any obvious candidates for accreting black holes ( j. s. clark , in prep ) .",
    "the best means of identifying neutron stars is to search for rotationally - modulated x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , for the brightest sources , we adjusted the arrival times of their photons to the solar system barycenter and computed fourier periodograms using the rayleigh statistic ( @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the individual x - ray events were recorded with a time resolution of 3.2  s , so the nyquist frequency was @xmath120.15  hz , which represents the limit below which our sensitivity could be well - characterised .",
    "however , we computed the periodogram using a maximum frequency of @xmath120.6 hz , to take advantage of the limited sensitivity to higher frequency signals , and to ensure that any observed signal was not an alias .",
    "we searched the two observations separately , so that a search for signals from a single source required 3221 independent trials for the may observation , and 6239 trials for the june observation .",
    "the corresponding single - source detection threshold powers for 99% confidence in each observation are @xmath23=12.7 and 13.3 , respectively , where the powers have been normalised so that poisson noise produces power with a mean value of 1 .",
    "this power can be related to the root - mean - squared ( rms ) amplitude of a sinusoidal signal by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of photons from the source .",
    "a fully - modulated signal would have an amplitude of 0.71 , so the minimum number of counts required to detect a signal are @xmath25=51 and 53 , respectively .",
    "we searched 8 sources above this count limit in the may observation , and 16 sources in the june observation .",
    "one periodic signal from the brightest x - ray source in the field ,   ( @xmath26 = 251.79250,45.87136 [ j2000 ] , @xmath1303 with 90% conf . ) , significantly exceeded the expected noise in both observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : periodogram ] ) .",
    "we refined an initial estimate of the period by computing pulse profiles from non - overlapping 5000 s intervals during each observation , and modelling the differences between the assumed and measured phases using first - and second - order polynomials .",
    "the reference epochs of the pulse maxima for the two observations were 53512.860265(4 ) and 53539.67325(2 ) ( mjd , tbd ) .",
    "the best - fit periods were 10.6112(4 ) s and 10.6107(1 ) s for 2005 may and june , respectively .",
    "this placed a limit on the difference in period between the two observations of @xmath27 ms , or on the period derivative of @xmath0 s s@xmath1 . from the quadratic fits to the phases during the individual may and june observations , we found @xmath28 and @xmath29 ms ( @xmath30 s s@xmath1 and @xmath31 s s@xmath1 ) , respectively . unfortunately , there was a @xmath122 cycle ambiguity when trying to predict the phases over the month interval between observations , so the period can not be refined further using the current observations .",
    "nonetheless , the stability of the signal from   suggests that it is produced by the rotation of neutron star .",
    "we extracted spectra of  using standard tools and the acis_extract routine .",
    "we found no evidence that the intensity of the source changed between may and june , so we combined the spectra obtained from both observations .",
    "we modeled the spectrum using xspec version 12 @xcite .",
    "all uncertainties were computed using 1@xmath32 confidence intervals ( @xmath33@xmath341 ) .",
    "the spectrum could be described equally well ( @xmath3510% chance probability ) by black body , bremsstrahlung , or power law continuum models that were absorbed and scattered by the interstellar medium ( ism ) . to facilitate comparisons with other isolated neutron stars ,",
    "we report the parameters of black body model ( @xmath36 ) , for which we derive an absorption column of @xmath37 @xmath16 , a best - fit temperature of @xmath38 kev , and an apparent radius of @xmath5 km . comparing the three continuum models",
    ", we found that the interstellar extinction toward the source is @xmath39 @xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with the range measured for other cluster members , @xmath40\\times10^{22}$ ] @xmath16 , where the dispersion can be accounted for by variable extinction caused by a foreground molecular cloud ( see clark  2005 ) . the observed flux was @xmath41 erg @xmath16 s@xmath1   ( 0.58.0 kev ) .",
    "we de - reddened the three models , and found @xmath42  erg s@xmath1   ( 0.58 kev ) .    to evaluate whether  is an accreting system , we searched for an infrared counterpart in @xmath43-band images taken with the sofi instrument on the eso new technology telescope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kimage ] ) .",
    "there was no counterpart to the pulsar within the 03 uncertainty in its location ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the upper limit to its intensity was @xmath43@xmath4418.5 , ruling out a companion with @xmath8@xmath91 @xmath10  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the faintest stars that have contracted onto the main sequence in westerlund 1 have @xmath11=2@xmath10(brandner , in prep . ) .",
    "the spectrum and luminosity of  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) demonstrate that it is not a conventional radio pulsar .",
    "first , the power lost as the pulsar spins down is too small to produce the observed x - ray emission . assuming that it is a 10  km , 1.4@xmath10  neutron star ( @xmath45 g @xmath46 ) , the upper limit to the period derivative ( @xmath47 s s@xmath1 ) implies that the spin - down energy is @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "this is similar to the observed x - ray luminosity , whereas magnetospheric emission from a radio pulsar with @xmath49  erg s@xmath1  would produce @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "second , the x - ray emission is inconsistent with thermal emission from a young , cooling neutron star .",
    "although the characteristic temperature of the emission ( @xmath51@xmath120.6 kev ) is consistent with the high end of the range expected for cooling neutron stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the luminosity is @xmath52 times lower than would be expected if the surface of the neutron star had a uniform temperature .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray emission is consistent with that of highly - magnetized ( @xmath53@xmath9@xmath54 g ) , slowly rotating pulsars , which are referred to as magnetars @xcite .",
    "known magnetars have spin periods between 5 and 12 s , @xmath55 erg s@xmath1 , and spectra that peak at @xmath122 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission is also consistent with that from faint , wind - accreting neutron stars , such as a 0535 + 26 ( @xmath56=104 s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , x per ( @xmath56=837 s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 4u 0115 + 63 ( @xmath56=3.6 s ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , forming a close , accreting binary from a system that initially contained two stars with @xmath8@xmath940@xmath10  ( see below ) and @xmath8@xmath71@xmath10  would present a significant challenge to models for producing low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we suspect that  is a magnetar .",
    "it is likely that  is associated with westerlund 1 , because galactic x - ray pulsars with @xmath56=330 s are rare ( only @xmath1220 known ; * ? ? ? * ) . to evaluate the chance that this pulsar is a random galactic object unassociated with westerlund 1",
    ", we attempted to determine the surface density of slow x - ray pulsars on the sky .",
    "previous searches for x - ray pulsars were biased toward the most luminous x - ray sources , so we searched @xmath12350 fields in the galactic plane ( @xmath57@xmath7@xmath58@xmath75@xmath59 ) that were observed with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_. aside from @xmath1215 known examples that were the targets of the relevant observations",
    ", we found no new pulsars with @xmath56=330 s ( a. nechita , in prep ) .",
    "therefore , the chance of discovering a slow x - ray pulsar in any pointing is @xmath350.3% .",
    "( we note that the @xmath1215 known slow x - ray pulsars within the more conservative latitude range of @xmath60@xmath71@xmath59  have a surface density of @xmath610.03 degree@xmath18 .",
    "the acis - s fov is @xmath120.07 degree@xmath18 , which also implies that the chance of finding a slow pulsar in a _",
    "chandra _",
    "observation is @xmath610.2% . )",
    "moreover ,  lies only 17 from the center of westerlund 1 ( 2.3@xmath62 $ ] pc in projection ) .",
    "based on the spatial distribution of x - ray sources described above , a source at that location has a @xmath6110% chance of being a random association .",
    "we conclude that this pulsar is a member of westerlund 1 with @xmath6199.97% confidence .",
    "the fact that  is member of westerlund 1 places a lower limit on the initial mass of its progenitor . @xcite have established that the cluster is only 4@xmath131 myr old , so that the minimum mass of a star that could have undergone a supernova is @xmath1240 @xmath10 .",
    "this is supported by the identification of several o7o8v stars in the cluster , which have zero - age main sequence masses of 3437 @xmath10  ( j. s. clark , in prep . ) .",
    "therefore ,  was produced by a star with @xmath11@xmath940@xmath10 .",
    "previously , only three secure lower limits were obtained on the masses of progenitors to neutron stars , all of which were for magnetars .",
    "first , a shell of hi around 1e 1048.15937 was interpreted as ism displaced by the wind of a progenitor with @xmath11=3040@xmath10@xcite .",
    "second , sgr 1900 + 14 was suggested to be a member of a star cluster @xmath7@xmath63 myr old @xcite , placing a lower limit on the progenitor mass of @xmath64@xmath6520@xmath10 .",
    "finally , sgr 180620 was claimed to be a member of a star cluster that is only @xmath354.5  myr old",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing a limit of @xmath11@xmath6550@xmath10(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our evidence that  also descended from a star with @xmath11@xmath940 @xmath10  dispels much of the doubt that the previous results represented chance associations .",
    "these results demonstrate that some stars with @xmath11@xmath940  @xmath10  do not collapse into black holes at the ends of their lives , but instead form neutron stars .",
    "this implies that massive stars can lose @xmath4495% of their mass either before or during supernovae . before supernovae ,",
    "stars could lose mass through strong winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or be stripped of mass by binary companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during supernovae",
    ", rapidly - rotating cores could drive mass away through magneto - hydrodynamic winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to determine the importance of these effects , it is necessary to identify additional neutron stars in star clusters and constrain the masses of their progenitors",
