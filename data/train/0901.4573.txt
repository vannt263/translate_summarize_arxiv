    "in 1942 combining fluid hydrodynamics and electromagnetism hannes alfvn discovered a new mode of waves , thus opening a new field of research .",
    "he studied the mutual interaction between conducting fluid motion and electromagnetic fields and discovered these waves ( alfvn , 1942 ) that later on were named _",
    "alfvn waves_. however , to be verified the waves needed to be detected in laboratory experiments .",
    "this was done in the late 40s and beginning of the 50s , in experiments with mercury and liquid sodium .",
    "it was discovered that in liquid metals the waves are strongly damped . in the 60s , experiments in plasma",
    "demonstrated weakly damped alfvn waves with the properties predicted by the theory . since then",
    "this field has expanded mainly due to space studies and thermonuclear research , making possible , among other things , to create high temperature plasma in laboratories .",
    "an alfvn wave propagating in a plasma is a traveling oscillation of the ions and the magnetic field .",
    "the ion mass density provides the inertia and the magnetic field line tension provides the restoring force .",
    "the wave vector can either propagate in the parallel direction of the magnetic field or at oblique incidence .",
    "the waves efficiently carry energy and momentum along the magnetic field lines .",
    "identification of alfvn waves in the solar wind by means of spacecraft measurements was first achieved in late 60s . in 2007 , tomczyk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reported the detection of alfvn waves in images of the solar corona with the coronal multi - channel polarimeter instrument at the national solar observatory , new mexico .",
    "also in 2007 , several research groups reconfirmed that alfvn waves have sufficient energy to heat the solar corona and momentum to accelerate the solar wind ( de pontieu et al .",
    ", 2007 ; okamoto et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the sun is a benchmark for stellar research providing an example of a cool main sequence star losing mass .    since the discovery of the high velocity winds from o and b supergiant stars by morton ( 1967 ) and his co - workers ( morton , jenkins & brooks , 1969 ) , the theories of stellar winds had their interest amplified .",
    "on another part of the hr diagram , the winds from evolved k and m stars , characterized by low velocities , demanded a different theoretical approach .",
    "although presenting very different terminal velocities , in the range of 600 - 3500 km s@xmath0 for early - type and 10 - 100 km s@xmath0 for late - type k and m stars , these stars present a similarity : both luminous early and late - type stars are losing mass at a rate as high as 10@xmath1 @xmath2 yr@xmath0 ( lamers & cassinelli , 1999 ) .",
    "the idea that a flux of alfvn waves could accelerate winds of stars in many regions of the hr diagram remount from a few decades ago ( hollweg , 1973 , 1987 ; hartmann & macgregor , 1980 ; holzer , fla & leer , 1983 ; underhill 1983 ; hartmann & avrett , 1984 ; jatenco - pereira and opher , 1989a , b , c ; dos santos , jatenco - pereira and opher , 1993 ; jatenco - pereira , opher and yamamoto , 1994 ; among others ) .",
    "the belief that alfvn waves are present in the magnetized winds of cool giant stars is supported by the fact that these waves are observed in the solar wind ( smith et al .",
    ", 1995 ; balogh et al . , 1995 ) . if there are oscillations in the magnetic field at the base of the wind , alfvn waves will be generated .",
    "as they propagate outward , the dissipation of their energy and the transfer of their momentum to the plasma can heat and accelerate the wind . as an example of how these waves can be used as an acceleration mechanism of a stellar wind",
    ", we show later on this paper a simple model to explain the mass - loss in a typical supergiant k5 star ( section 3 ) . in section 2",
    ", we present the issue of the damping of the alfvn waves . in section 4 , we apply this model to a typical k5 supergiant star and in section 5 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "for cool red giant stars the flux of alfvn waves can provide an efficient driving mechanism for the wind . in this mechanism",
    "it is the wave magnetic pressure that accelerates the wind .",
    "hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) showed that if the waves are not damped , the resultant terminal velocities are much higher than observed . assuming that the waves are damped with a constant damping length",
    ", they obtained terminal velocities and mass - loss rate consistent with the observations .    in order to improve the model presented by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989a ) discarded the use of an artificial constant damping length for the waves and considered three different physical damping mechanisms : ( i ) the nonlinear damping , ( ii ) the resonant surface damping , and ( iii ) the turbulent damping .",
    "they showed that , for an isothermal atmosphere with @xmath3  k , their model can reproduce the observed large mass - loss rates and the small ratios between the terminal velocity and the escape velocity at the base ( @xmath4 ) of these stellar winds .    to illustrate this mechanism",
    ", we present a simplified version of this model ( see vidotto & jatenco - pereira , 2006 ; falceta - gonalves , vidotto & jatenco - pereira , 2006 for a more complete analysis ) .",
    "we focus our study on the resonant surface damping for the alfvn waves .",
    "a surface wave exists at the interface separating two environments , e.g. , open magnetic flux tubes .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic surface waves may decay through a process called  resonance absorption \" ( hollweg , 1987 ) , that leads to a concentration of the surface wave energy into the thin resonant layer . in this layer",
    ", the energy may be dissipated locally as heat or concentrated in the form of turbulent alfvn waves which may propagate further and be dissipated elsewhere , or concentrated in other forms , such as high energy particles , electric currents , etc . in the present paper",
    "we suggest that resonant absorption dissipates the energy locally as heat with the damping length @xmath5 given by ( jatenco - pereira & opher , 1989a ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the damping length of the wave at the base of the wind , @xmath8 is the alfvn - mach number , the alfvn speed is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the cross - section of a flux tube at a radial distance @xmath11 .",
    "the index `` @xmath12 '' indicates that the parameter is being evaluated at the stellar surface , i.e. , at @xmath13 .",
    "if a large damping length is considered ( i.e. , there is a smooth damping of the wave throughout the wind ) , there will be a non negligible outward force acting beyond the critical point of the wind , creating thus a high - speed wind .",
    "hence , the damping length can not be too large .",
    "this will also assure that the wkb approximation is valid in the wind we study .",
    "the first attempts in accelerating winds by means of alfvn waves considered that the waves were propagating in an isothermal ambient .",
    "this assumption simplifies the equations , since the energy equation simply reads @xmath14 constant .",
    "however , if we are interested in modeling the temperature profile of the wind , there is a need to solve a consistent energy equation simultaneously with the mass and momentum equations of the wind . in this way , we are able to obtain both the temperature and the velocity profiles of the wind and compare them with observations .      for a long time",
    ", it is known that the coronal holes are the source of the high - speed solar wind streams at the earth s orbit ( e.g. , peter & judge , 1999 ) .",
    "solar coronal holes observations show a superradial expansion of the magnetic flux tubes : the area expansion of a solar coronal hole is @xmath15 times greater than for a radial expansion ( lie - svendsen , hansteen & leer , 2002 ; esser et al . , 2005 ; tu et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989a ) implemented the alfvn wave driven wind model by taking into account our knowledge on coronal holes in the sun .",
    "we apply the same assumption for cool giant stars . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that in the wind of a typical k5 supergiant star , the non - radial expansion factor is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the solid angles measured at the stellar surface and at the edge of the coronal hole , respectively .",
    "hence , in order to model the diverging geometry for the magnetic field , we follow the idea given by kuin and hearn ( 1982 ) .",
    "thus , the cross - section of a flux tube at a radial distance @xmath11 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , the superradial index , is a parameter that determines the divergence of the geometry from the stellar radius @xmath21 up to the transition radius @xmath22 , as shown in figure  [ geometry ] .",
    "for a given @xmath23 , @xmath22 is obtained by @xmath24 hence , we have @xmath25 considering this geometry , the conservation of magnetic flux yields a magnetic field intensity of @xmath26 a detailed study of the diverging geometry of the magnetic field in the winds of late - type stars can be found in jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989a ) .    .",
    "the magnetic field geometry is divergent up to the transition radius @xmath22 , i.e. , it has a superradial index @xmath27 . beyond @xmath22 ,",
    "the magnetic field lines become radial and the index equals @xmath28 . ]      the equation of mass continuity expresses the conservation of mass . if the flow velocity is denoted by @xmath29 and the gas density is @xmath30 , we have in steady - state @xmath31 the constant @xmath32 in equation  ( [ mass ] )",
    "is computed at the wind base , i.e. , @xmath33 .    assuming a steady flow , the equation of motion is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational attraction force",
    ", @xmath36 is the pressure gradient , and @xmath37dr$ ] is the alfvn wave magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is the magnetic field amplitude of the wave .",
    "it is related to the energy density @xmath39 of the wave by @xmath40 the energy equation is determined through the balance between wave heating , adiabatic expansion , and radiative cooling ( hartmann , edwards , & avrett , 1982 ) .",
    "assuming an ideal gas , we can write the gas pressure as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath43 is the gas temperature , and @xmath44 is the mean mass per particle .",
    "thus , neglecting conduction , we write the energy equation as    @xmath45    the term @xmath46 is the rate at which the waves do work on the gas .",
    "@xmath47 is the wave heating rate , i.e. , the rate at which the gas is being heated due to dissipation of wave energy , and @xmath48 is the radiative cooling rate , both in erg  @xmath49  s@xmath0 .",
    "the wave heating can be written as ( hollweg , 1973 ) @xmath50 and the radiative cooling is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electron density , @xmath53 is the hydrogen density and @xmath54 is the radiative loss function . here , we adopt @xmath54 given by schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1993 ) and calculate @xmath52 as hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) .",

    "the model is applied here to the wind of a typical k5 supergiant star with a mass of 16  m@xmath65 and a radius of 400  r@xmath65 .",
    "we adopt a temperature of @xmath66  k at the base of the wind , and assume that the magnetic field intensity is @xmath67  g at this location . in our model , we adopt an initial wave flux of @xmath68  erg  @xmath69  s@xmath0 , which is of the same order of magnitude as the one estimated for the sun ( banerjee et al . , 1998 ) , and take @xmath70 and @xmath71 . the initial density is @xmath72 .",
    "we perform the calculations until @xmath73 , where the terminal velocity has been already reached .      similarly to the wind first studied by parker ( 1960 ) , the momentum equation ( eq .  [ [ momentum2 ] ] )",
    "has a critical point when the term in brackets on the left - hand side becomes zero , and hence the bracketed term on the right - hand side must necessarily be zero too .",
    "the requirement that the wind velocity should increase through the critical point determines the initial velocity at the base of the wind , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "hence , to find the critical solution for a given set of initial conditions , we iterate the initial velocity until the solution passes through the critical point . together with the initial density , the initial velocity determines the mass - loss rate .",
    "our results are shown in figure 2 , where the velocity and the temperature profiles obtained were plotted for @xmath75 .",
    "we obtained a terminal velocity of @xmath76  km  s@xmath77 and a mass - loss rate of @xmath78  m@xmath65  yr@xmath0 .",
    "these results compares favorably with observations : observationally , the terminal velocity should be lower than the surface escape velocity in a ratio around 1:2 , and the mass - loss rate should range from @xmath79 to @xmath80 m@xmath65 yr@xmath0 ( linsky 1998 ) .        according to roddier & roddier ( 1985 )",
    ", the cii emission detected in cool winds of giant stars is associated to regions with temperatures of @xmath81  k. carpenter , robinson , & judge ( 1995 ) obtained , for the wind of @xmath82  cru ( m3.4iii ) , a maximum temperature of @xmath83  k. carpenter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a maximum temperature of @xmath84  k for the wind of @xmath85  vel ( k5ib ) .",
    "for @xmath86  aur ( k4ib ) , eaton ( 1993 ) found that the wind temperature reaches @xmath87  k at @xmath88 .",
    "we can see in figure 2 an abrupt rise in the temperature of the wind : the temperature rises from @xmath89  k to @xmath90  k in the range from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "this heating is mainly due to the dissipation of the alfvn waves , ie , caused by the wave damping . at large distances ,",
    "when almost all the flux of alfvn waves has been dissipated , the flow expands adiabatically .",
    "hence , in the absence of strong heating , the temperature tends to fall monotonically with the adiabatic exponent @xmath93 .",
    "as to exemplify the effects of the choice of @xmath7 in our model , we have run a second model taking into account a different value of initial damping length : @xmath94 . comparing this second model with the previous one",
    ", we obtained a value of @xmath95 km / s while for the first model a flow with a terminal velocity of @xmath96 km / s was achieved .",
    "this situation is explained by the position where a large fraction of the energy is deposited in the wind .",
    "if energy is mainly deposited in the super - critical part of the flow , as is the case for the second model , the initial structure of the wind is not modified , i.e. , it maintains the same mass - loss rate , but the super - critical part is accelerated . comparing the mass - loss rate",
    ", we obtained for the first model @xmath97  m@xmath65  yr@xmath0 , while for the second @xmath98  m@xmath65  yr@xmath0 .",
    "we presented here some characteristics of alfvn waves and showed how these waves can be used as an acceleration mechanism of stellar winds . as a particular case , we evaluated the wind temperature and velocity profiles of a typical k5 supergiant star using an outward - directed flux of alfvn waves as the main acceleration mechanism of the wind . for a typical k5 supergiant star",
    ", we obtained a high mass - loss rate and a low terminal velocity consistent with observations .",
    "it is important to notice that after the recent report on the unambiguously detection of alfvn waves in the solar corona , these waves will increase their applicability in the sun and in several astrophysical environments .",
