    "the distribution of stellar masses that form in one star - formation event in a given volume of space is called initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "some theoretical studies consider that the imf should vary with the pressure and temperature of the star - forming cloud in such a way that higher - temperature regions ought to produce higher average stellar masses while others have exactly opposite views ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "detailed knowledge of the imf shape in different star forming environments is therefore essential .",
    "one would like to know whether it is universal in time and space or not .",
    "for this , in a galaxy , its young ( age @xmath13 100 myr ) star clusters of different ages , abundance etc . need to be observed , as they contain dynamically unevolved , ( almost ) coeval sets of stars at the same distance with the same metallicity . for a number of such reasons , populous young star clusters of the large magellanic clouds ( lmc ) are the most suitable objects for investigating the imf .",
    "they provide physical conditions not present in our galaxy e.g. stellar richness , metallicity and mass ranges ( see @xcite and references therein ) . unlike the galactic counterparts , where corrections for interstellar absorption are not always trivial since it could be large as well as variable @xcite , for lmc star clusters it is relatively small .",
    "its treatment is therefore not a problem .",
    "furthermore , choosing young ( age @xmath11 myr ) clusters reduces the effects of dynamical evolution on their mf .",
    "the present day mass function of these stellar systems can therefore be considered as the imf .",
    "the study of young lmc star clusters is thus important for providing the answer to the question of universality of the imf .",
    "both ground and hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations have therefore been obtained ( see and references therein ) for a few of the large number of young lmc star clusters @xcite .",

    "the photometric data of the clusters under study have been used to study extent of the clusters along with their colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and mass function in the following sub sections .",
    "the spatial surface density profile of stars can be used to determine cluster radius , @xmath51 , which is taken as the distance from the cluster center where the average cluster contribution becomes negligible with respect to the background stellar field .",
    "it can also be used to estimate extent of field star contamination in the cluster region . for this , first we derive the cluster center iteratively by calculating average x and y positions of stars within 150 pixels from an eye estimated centre , until it converged to a constant value .",
    "an error of about 10 to 20 pixels is expected in locating the cluster centre .",
    "the ( x , y ) pixel coordinates of the cluster centres are given in table [ tab : radden ] .",
    "for determining the radial surface density of stars in a cluster , the imaged area has been divided into a number of concentric circles with respect to the above estimated cluster centre , in such a way that each zone contains statistically significant numbers of stars .",

    ", it has been accounted far in the determination of @xmath56 .",
    "the assumed concentric circles and the stellar surface densities derived in this way for the clusters under discussion are shown in figs 4 to 6 and 8 to 12 .",
    "presence of clear radius - density variation confirms the relatively small diameters ( compactness ) of the star clusters under study .",
    "the level of field star density derived from the outer region are also shown in these figures .",
    "the field star densities up to @xmath57 mag are in the range of 69 to 102 star arcmin@xmath58 with an average value of about 80 stars arcmin@xmath58 . for ngc 2002 and ngc 2136",
    ", the field stellar density is also estimated from a @xmath59 region lying @xmath60 away from cluster center .",
    "the derived mean densities are 78 and 56 stars arcmin@xmath58 respectively .",
    "the corresponding values derived from the outermost region of the clusters ( @xmath61 ) are 79 and 80 stars / arcmin@xmath62 . within our statistical uncertainty ,",
    "they are similar .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that the extent of field star contamination is similar in all the clusters under discussion .",
    "we also derive the spatial variation of the field star density from the imaged field regions taking @xmath63 pix and @xmath64 pix as its center and the same are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2002 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : n2136 ] .",
    "it is seen that the stellar density of the field region follows the background densities derived from the outermost regions of these two clusters .",
    "this indicates that stars with @xmath65 can be used to estimate field star contamination in the cluster . from these numbers as well as the cluster sequences present in the cm diagrams discussed below",
    ", one may say that the field star contamination in the stars brighter than @xmath66 mag is not strong enough to smear the cluster sequences and hence affect the results derived below .",
    "as our data are substantially incomplete in the crowded central region of the clusters , we are unable to evaluate the value of stellar density at the cluster center .",
    "consequently , the radius at which central stellar density becomes half can not be determined .",
    "however , the radial density profiles of all the clusters clearly indicate the innermost cluster region ( @xmath13 30 pixel ) where stellar crowding is so large that it can not be used to determine the cluster mf accurately . similarly , the outermost regions of the clusters where the stellar density becomes flat is clearly defined and we have considered this as the cluster radius . in figs 4 to 6 and 8 to 12 , one can see that for all the clusters beyond a radius @xmath67 , the number of stars up to 20 mag per unit area drops to a uniform level which might be considered as a good approximation of the background density . the cluster radius for the target clusters range from 120 pixels ( @xmath68 ) for ngc 2006 & sl 538 to 260 pixels ( @xmath69 ) for ngc 2136 .",
    "its value is about @xmath70 for ngc 1767 and ngc 2098 while the remaining clusters have a radius of about @xmath71 . in order to see radial variations of mf",
    ", the entire cluster region ( excluding core ) has been divided into two annulus region i.e. ring 1 and ring 2 .",
    "the pixel values of the cluster radius , core region , ring 1 and ring 2 are listed in table [ tab : radden ] .      in order to properly analyse the cmds of our lmc clusters ,",
    "it is necessary to delineate the cluster sequences from the unavoidable field star contamination .",
    "we therefore constructed cmds of stars located at different radial distances from the cluster center .",
    "this helps us to clearly distinguish cluster features from those characterising the surrounding lmc fields .",
    "consequently , two cmds for each cluster , one representing the features of the clusters while other characterising the surrounding field region are constructed .",
    "figures [ fig : n1767 ] to [ fig : n2002 ] and [ fig : n2003 ] to [ fig : n2136 ] show the cmds of the cluster ( @xmath72 ) as well as of the field ( @xmath65 ) regions . for ngc 2002 and ngc 2136 , we also show the cmds of a nearby field ( @xmath73 ) regions in figs 7 and 13 respectively .",
    "a characteristic ms from @xmath74 mag to 20 mag is seen in all the clusters , except ngc 2136 where it begins at around @xmath75 16 mag , indicating their youthful ( age @xmath76 myr ) nature .",
    "in addition , the brighter end ( @xmath77 mag ) is also populated by a few blue and red supergiants .",
    "this is in contrast to the field regions which is only sparsely populated by stars towards lower ms ( @xmath78 mag ) .",
    "red clump of stars near @xmath79 mag , @xmath80 mag and @xmath81 mag in the cmds , are populated by evolved stars arising from the old age ( @xmath82 1 gr ) stellar populations of the lmc .",
    "such a feature has also been observed in other ccd photometric studies of lmc star clusters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these are intermediate age core helium burning stars of the lmc field forming a clump in the cmds .    for constructing mass functions of the clusters under study ,",
    "we need determination of distance , age and reddening for each object and the same are being described below .",
    "a value of @xmath83 mag for the true distance modulus of the lmc is now well constrained since it is derived using more than two dozen independent measurements ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the individual determinations , however , vary from 18.1 to 18.8 mag primarily due to different standard candles being used e.g. the red clump , tip of red giant branch , cepheids , rr lyrae stars , mira variables , sn1987a , eclipsing binaries etc .",
    "we adopt @xmath84 mag as distance modulus for lmc in the present study .",
    "being everything similar , smaller distances result in lower ages and affect the derived mass ranges for mfs .",
    "a closer analysis indicates that adopting distance modulus 0.4 mag different changes the derived mass functions significantly , although its effect on mf slopes are observed to be negligible @xcite .",
    "we use the stellar evolutionary models by @xcite to estimate clusters ages and adopt a constant value of metallicity @xmath85 ( fe / h @xmath3 0.3 dex ) .",

    "effects of metallicity variation on the derived mf slope indicate that it becomes flatter with decreasing value of z. a change in z from 0.02 to 0.004 has a negligible effect on the mf slope , see fig .",

    "reddening towards surrounding lmc region is observed to be around @xmath88 mag as estimated from all sky maps at 100 @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "based on hi emission map @xcite , the predicted @xmath90 towards cluster lie between 0.05 to 0.1 mag .",
    "however , the intra - galactic reddening across lmc is observed to vary and it may be as high as 0.3 mag in some regions @xcite .",
    "we therefore adjusted the value of reddening to best fit the isochrones to the ms .",
    "our age estimates are greatly facilitated by the presence of a few blue and red supergiants .",
    "the best estimate for age lies between two isochrones identified for each cluster and are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : n1767 ] to [ fig : n2002 ] and [ fig : n2003 ] to [ fig : n2136 ] and accordingly , we adopt mean age ( @xmath91/myr ) and uncertainty .",

    "the present age estimates for ngc 2006 ( @xmath93 myr ) and sl 538 ( @xmath94 myr ) are consistent with the corresponding estimates of @xmath24 myr and @xmath23 myr by @xcite .",
    "our age estimate ( @xmath1 myr ) for ngc 2098 is significantly younger than the estimate of 63 - 79 myr by @xcite . for all other clusters",
    "this is the first reliable estimate of age using main - sequence turn - off point in the cmds .",
    "however , studies using integrated spectra of star clusters and single population stellar library derive about 10 myr systematically younger ages @xcite . barring ngc 2098 and ngc 2136 , their age estimates for the remaining 7 clusters of our sample lie between 6 to 8 myr , while , our estimates range from 15 to 20 myr .",
    "the age estimates derived from integrated spectra using theoretical models seem to be biased towards blue ms stars .",
    "a gap in the ms is defined as a band , not necessarily perpendicular to the ms , with no or very few stars .",
    "@xcite first located a gap in ms around @xmath95 mag which arise due to onset of convection in the stellar envelope .",
    "gaps seem to appear as statistically distinct features in ms of star clusters @xcite . ms gaps in the present sample were identified visually and",
    "the gap parameters are listed in table [ tab : age ] . except ngc 2136 ,",
    "all the target clusters have about 0.3 to 0.5 mag wide gap between @xmath96 @xmath97 to @xmath98 mag .",
    "this seems to be characteristic feature of stellar evolution as the brighter gap location corresponds to the younger clusters .",
    "stellar evolution models do predict paucity of stars around and beyond the ms turn off .",
    "however , some clusters seem to have clumpy ms with more than one gaps , for example , ngc 2003 and ngc 2011 show gaps of smaller amplitude ( @xmath99 mag ) at fainter magnitudes .",
    "both these clusters have elongated spatial structures and may have star forming history different from the other clusters .",
    "it is therefore noted that the gaps may also arise due to stochastic effects of star formation and sampling along the main sequence and it may not represent any genuine astrophysical effects .      the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of lmc star clusters and their corresponding field region is derived from star counts in bin width of 0.5 mag in @xmath45 from the @xmath45 , @xmath100 diagrams .",
    "it has been preferred over other cmds due to fainter limiting magnitude and better data completeness .",
    "the main factors which limit the precise determinations of cluster mf from present observations are data incompleteness and field star contamination as the central region of the clusters are more likely to suffer from data incompleteness while the outer region is more affected by field star contamination .",
    "moreover , the present photometry is generally not able to resolve the central 30 pixel diameter region of each cluster .",
    "we therefore , estimate the lfs for the inner ( ring 1 ) , outer ( ring 2 ) , and entire regions of each cluster excluding the core .",
    "these regions are marked in the radial density profile of the respective clusters ( see sect [ sec : radden ] ) and also listed in table [ tab : radden ] .    for data completeness factor ( cf )",
    ", we follow the usual daophot procedure of adding and recovering the artificially selected stars with known magnitudes and positions in the original @xmath45 and @xmath50 frame and the effective cf is taken to be smaller value of them .",
    "we estimate cf separately for inner , outer , and entire regions as well as the corresponding field regions which is usually defined as @xmath101 ( see table [ tab : radden ] ) . in the case of ngc 2002 and ngc 2136",

    "our age estimates for ngc 2006 and sl 538 were found to be consistent with the previous @xmath124 photometric estimate by @xcite . for ngc 2098 ,",
    "our estimates are lower by about 30 myr than @xcite .",
    "thus , the ages of all the clusters in our sample are significantly lower than their typical dynamical ages of a few 100 myrs .",
    "2 .   for younger ( @xmath13 25 myr ) clusters , the age estimates based on a recent population synthesis models by @xcite and integrated spectra are systematically lower by about 10 myr than the present age estimates based on cmds .",
    "3 .   assuming an lmc distance modulus of 18.5 mag , the derived reddening for the clusters in our sample was found to be consistent with that derived from hi emission and 100 @xmath89 all sky dust maps .",
    "4 .   in the mass range of @xmath125 ,",
    "the mf slopes for 8 out of 9 sample clusters were found to be similar with values of @xmath6 ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "for ngc 1767 the slope was found to be significantly shallower with @xmath126 .",
    "the present mf values are consistent with those derived by @xcite for ngc 2006 and sl 538 .",
    "@xcite studied the star formation history and imf of the field population of 30 doradus super association and found that it has a salpeter slope in the mass range of 7 to 40 @xmath5 .",
    "mass function slopes of the inner and outer cluster regions indicates the presence of mass segregations in ngc 2002 , ngc 2006 , ngc 2136 and ngc 2098 . for ngc 2098 , @xcite derive the dynamical relaxation time ,",

    "this may indicate that the value of @xmath127 for lmc star clusters could be few hundreds of myr .",
    "the ages of lmc star clusters under study are therefore significantly smaller than their dynamical relaxation time . consequently , observed mass segregation in these clusters is probably primordial in nature . a compilation of both ground and space based observations of extremely young galactic and mc star clusters ( cf .",
