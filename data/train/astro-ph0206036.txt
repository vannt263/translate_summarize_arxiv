    "this has encouraged the study of plausible new particle candidates for the dark matter .",

    "given the requirements of neutralino production in the early universe , it is possible to study the phenomenology of such dark matter candidates in detail ( see , e.g. , jungman , kamionkowsky , and griest 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , the annihilation of neutralinos has often been considered a potential source of detectable secondaries : high energy particles and electromagnetic radiation . in this sense",
    ", dark matter can be visible through the radiation caused by the annihilation secondaries ( berezinsky , gurevich and zybin 1992 ; berezinsky , bottino and mignola 1994 ; gondolo and silk 1999 ; bergstrm et al .",

    "recent advances in cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations have shown that the large scale structure of the universe can be explained in terms of a hierarchical scenario in which large halos of dark matter are generated by the continuous merging of smaller halos ( ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this picture ,",
    "a dark matter halo is the superposition of a smooth component on a scale comparable with the virial radius of the forming structure and a clumped structure made of thousands of smaller mass halos . as we discuss below , this scenario can have important consequences for the detection of signals from neutralino - antineutralino ( @xmath2 ) annihilation .",
    "cdm simulations also show that most halos are well described by a density distribution with cusps at the center of each halo .",
    "the exact shape of the central cusp is still a matter of debate .",
    "most recent simulations favor profiles with density cusps varying from the moore et al .",
    "profile ( moore et al . 1999 ) where @xmath3 to a navarro , frenk , and white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro , frenk and white 1996 ) where @xmath4 ( see also power et al .",
    "the more concentrated the central cusp , the easier to detect annihilation products since the annihilation rate is proportional to the square of the dark matter density .",
    "the existence of cuspy halos is still unclear since observations of galaxy rotation curves provide no evidence of central cusps ( see , e.g. , salucci 2001 ) .",
    "however , the survival of cusps in galactic centers is highly dependent on the galaxy s merger history in particular on the history of formation of galactic center black holes ( merrit and milosavljevic 2002 ) . the central regions of small mass dark matter halos ( i.e. , dm clumps ) are less affected by the dynamics of baryonic matter and less likely to have black hole mergers at their centers .",
    "thus , a cuspy profile may well describe the density of dm clumps .",
    "another important piece of information is embedded in the spatial distribution and survival history of clumps on their way to the central part of the host galactic halo .",
    "tidal interactions significantly affect clump distribution and structure and these effects are only beginning to be resolved in cdm simulations for relatively large mass clumps ( stoehr et al .",
    "2002 ) . given the lack of a clear understanding of present distribution of dm clumps in the galaxy halo , we consider two different scenarios that bracket the present uncertainties .",
    "for simplicity we call these two approaches type i and type ii .",
    "we show that the present uncertainties lead to large variations in the resulting gamma - ray signal .    in the type i scenario ,",
    "the clump position in the host galaxy determines its external radius . in the case of nfw and moore profiles , the location of the core",
    "is then determined by assuming a fixed fraction of this external radius . in the type ii scenario ,",
    "the concentration parameter , defined as the ratio of the core radius to virial radius of a clump , is modeled as in wechsler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for clumps for a given mass .",
    "we show that in this scenario the clumps are gradually destroyed on their way to the center of the galaxy , such that the inner part of the galactic halo is depleted of clumps .",
    "this second scenario seems compatible with numerical simulations ( power et al .",
    "2002 , stoehr et al .",
    "the uncertainties on clump distribution and concentration bracketed by these two scenarios strongly affect the resulting @xmath0-ray emission from the annihilation of neutralinos : while in the type i scenario , the highly concentrated clumps produce strong @xmath0-ray emission , in the type ii scenario the low concentration clumps imply @xmath0-ray fluxes several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we introduce the clump density profiles ; in section 3 we discuss the distribution of clumps in the galaxy and the calculations of the gamma ray flux ; in section 4 we present our results , consisting of the spectra and anisotropies of the @xmath0-ray emission in the type i and ii scenarios , for different shapes of the clumps density profiles .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "the contribution to the diffuse @xmath0-ray background from @xmath2 annihilation in the clumpy halo depends on the distribution of clumps in the halo and on the density profile of clumps .",
    "our purpose here is to investigate the wide variety of possibilities currently allowed by the results of simulations and suggested by some theoretical arguments , concerning the density profiles of dark matter clumps .",
    "we consider three cases : singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) , moore et al .",
    "profiles , and nfw profiles .    the moore et al .",
    "and the nfw profiles are both the result of fits to different high resolution simulations ( moore et al .",

    "although there is ongoing debate over which profile is most accurate , it is presently believed that a realistic descriptions of the dark matter distribution in halos will follow a profile in the range defined by the moore et al .",

    "neutralino annihilations are faster than the cusp formation rate , so that @xmath9 remains constant . to estimate @xmath8 , following berezinsky , gurevich and zybin 1992 , we set the annihilation timescale equal to the free - fall timescale , so that @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 annihilation cross - section , @xmath14 is newton s constant , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the clump mass and the neutralino mass .",
    "we modeled the smooth galactic halo density with a nfw density profile ( eq .",
    "( [ nfw_profile ] ) ) , with @xmath17 kpc and @xmath18 determined by the condition that the dark matter density at the sun s position be @xmath19 .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the clump density profile are the density normalization @xmath18 , the clump radius @xmath20 and , in the case of moore et al . and nfw profiles , the clump fiducial radius @xmath21 .",
    "in order to fix these fundamental parameters we have considered two different scenarios ( type i and ii ) .    in the type",
    "i scenario , the radius of a clump with fixed mass is determined by its position in the galactic halo .",
    "more specifically , the radius of the clump is located at the radius where the clump density equals the density of the galactic ( smooth ) dark matter halo at the clump position ( namely @xmath18 ) .",
    "the physical motivation for such a choice is to account for the tidal stripping of the external layers of the clump while the clump is moving in the potential of the host halo .",
    "for the nfw and moore profiles , the fiducial radius @xmath21 has been taken as a fixed fraction of @xmath20 : @xmath22 .    in the type ii scenario the external radius of the clumps",
    "is taken to be their virial radius , defined in the usual way : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is 200 times the critical density of the universe @xmath25 g/@xmath26 ( we assume @xmath27 ) . in this scenario ,",

    "layers of the clump outside the fiducial radius are stripped off by the galactic halo tidal forces . the stripping distance defined in this way",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] .    from this estimate",
    "it is easy to see that most clumps in the inner parts of the host halo are stripped of most of their mass , so the number of clumps in the inner regions is very low .",
    "in fact , most clumps that are able to reach the central part of the galaxy merge with the smooth dark matter profile .",
    "only relatively lower mass older clumps can reach closer to the inner regions without significant disruption since they are in general more concentrated and have denser cores .",
    "numerical simulations show the disappearance of large clumps in the centers of galaxy size halos , but they can not resolve the smaller mass clumps that may eventually make their way into the core of the galaxy . in order to bracket the plausible range in clump distributions , we make the very conservative assumption in scenario ii that the inner 10 kpc of the galaxy halo have no clumps at all .",
    "in order to determine the gamma ray emission from the dm clumps , we model the distribution of clumps in the galaxy with a fit to numerical simulations as in blasi and sheth ( 2000 ) .",
    "the probability distribution function of clumps with a given mass and at a given position @xmath36 ( measured from the galactic center ) is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization constant and @xmath39 is the scale radius of the clump distribution ( assumed to be 10 kpc as in blasi and sheth 2000 ) .",

    "@xmath54 is the total number of photons emitted per unit time and energy by a dm clump of mass @xmath49 .",

    "note that eq .",
