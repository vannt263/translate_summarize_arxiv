    "the quest to understand the origin of the tiny fluctuations about a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe lies at the heart of both modern cosmology and high - energy physics .",
    "inflationary theory offers the most satisfying and plausible explanation for the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "inflation is a phase of superluminal expansion of space itself , within @xmath0 of the big bang , during which quantum fluctuations are stretched to cosmological scales ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "results from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments have established that the universe is almost spatially flat , with a nearly gaussian , scale - invariant spectrum of primordial adiabatic perturbations ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these features are all consistent with the simplest models of inflation . by providing accurate measurements of the e - mode ( gradient component ) polarization of the cmb ,",
    "the esa mission planck will offer more stringent tests of the inflationary paradigm @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even with such an accurate characterization of the scalar perturbations , a decisive confirmation of inflation will be lacking and large uncertainties in the allowed inflationary potentials will persist .",
    "inflation predicts the existence of primordial gravitational waves on cosmological scales . their detection would firmly establish the existence of a period of inflationary expansion in the early universe , and confirm the quantum origin of cosmological fluctuations that led to the large scale structure observed today .",
    "the search for primordial b - mode ( curl component ) polarization of the cmb provides the only opportunity to detect in the foreseeable future the imprint of these gravitational waves .",
    "measuring the amplitude of these tensor perturbations at one length scale would fix the energy scale of inflation and its potential .",
    "measuring their amplitude at more than one length scale would provide a powerful consistency check for a broad class of inflationary models .    if as suggested by recent cmb and large scale galaxy surveys , the power spectrum of primordial perturbations is not exactly scale invariant , then in a wide class of inflationary models the level of gravitational waves will be within the range accessible to a properly designed mission , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : underlyinganisotropies ] .",
    "the bulk of the statistical weight for detecting inflationary b modes is concentrated at two angular scales on the sky ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : underlyinganisotropies ] ) : firstly , at the reionization bump at multipoles @xmath1 and secondly at the multipole region from about 20 to 100 ( corresponding to angles larger than @xmath2 on the sky ) . given that most of the signal lies on large angular scales , a full - sky survey with exquisite stability and control of systematic errors of both instrumental and astrophysical origin is required , hence the need to go to space .",
    "the b mode polarization is a clean probe of gravitational waves , since primordial scalar perturbations do not contribute to b - modes , and the effects due to intervening gravitational lenses are calculable and of order @xmath3 .",
    "this sets the sensitivity target for the mission .",
    "in fact , as shown by the blue dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : science ] , the lensing contribution to the b - mode is below the primordial b - mode for tensor to scalar perturbation ratios , @xmath4 , above few  @xmath5 at least at multipoles @xmath6 , while , for example , a lensing subtraction at @xmath7% accuracy level ( in terms of angular power spectrum ) is adequate to identify the primordial b - mode for @xmath8 above few  @xmath9 .",

    ". , height=396 ]    a confirmation of inflation and determination of the inflationary potential would have profound implications for fundamental physics by providing new experimental data on the physics near the planck scale .",
    "the constraints established would be indispensable for model building in string and m theory .",
    "the energy scales probed by polarization measurements lie many orders of magnitude beyond any conceivable accelerator experiment .",
    "consequently , the quest for primordial gravitational waves from inflation constitutes a unique window for constraining the new physics near the planck scale , which will help understand how quantum gravity unifies with the other fundamental interactions .",
    "the implementation of this mission requires significant advances in three main areas : ( 1 ) a sensitivity to tensor modes of a factor of about 100 with respect to planck , ( 2 ) control of systematic effects at the level of a few nk , and ( 3 ) a precise ( @xmath20% ) knowledge of the galactic foreground polarization .",
    "aspects ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , related to the b - pol design , will be extensively discussed in the following sections .",
    "concerning ( 3 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : science ] compares the cmb b - mode ( for various @xmath8 values ) to the b - mode expected from the most relevant polarized foregrounds and their potential residuals assuming different levels of accuracy for their subtraction assuming b - pol sensitivities .",
    "as is evident , a removal of the foreground , and in particular of the galactic emission , at the level of about 1% is necessary to detect the primordial cmb b mode for @xmath21 .",
    "foreground subtraction to this level can already be achieved exploiting already ( or soon ) available all - sky ( or large area sky coverage ) surveys .",
    "important new data sets will become available in the next years regarding polarized foregrounds in the microwave ( e.g. , further wmap surveys , quad , bicept , ebex , boomerang , quiet , c@xmath22over , spider , planck , etc . ) , radio ( e.g. s - pass , pgms , c - bass , gem ) and far - ir ( e.g. pilot ) bands . in parallel",
    ", it will be crucial to generalize to polarization the component separation methods successfully applied to temperature data ( e.g. wiener filtering , maximum - entropy , spectral - matching ica , cca , phase methods ) as well as to refine the already existing component separation methods for polarized data ( e.g. template fitting methods , ica , fastica , polemica ) , and to develop new techniques .    obviously , the broad frequency coverage proposed for b - pol is crucial to allow the application of these methods at the required level of sensitivity .",
    "finally we remark that because of its high sensitivity and accuracy in polarization , a mission devoted to b - modes would make substantial contributions in several other areas of astrophysics , such as the physical modeling of galactic magnetic fields , interstellar dust and gas properties including turbulence effects @xcite , and of cosmology , such as gravitational lensing of the cmb , cosmological reionization , and magnetic fields in the early universe ( see e.g. respectively @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "b - pol is a medium class satellite with broad frequency coverage to enable reliable removal of galactic foreground contamination and an angular resolution good enough to access both multipole windows for detecting primordial gravitational waves from inflation . accessing the first window requires a full - sky survey , possible only from space . the required sensitivity would nominally require more than 100 years of integration time for the esa - planck mission , and moreover much better control of systematics in polarization .    to reach the required instrument performances ,",
    "the detector sensitivity @xmath23 of 50 @xmath24 can be achieved for an overall instrumental efficiency of 0.5 and a total bolometer nep ( noise equivalent power ) of typically @xmath25 , close to background limited performance .",
    "the sensitivity goal in the 6 bands requires a large number of pixels and a long duration mission .",
    "typical values are a total of 2000 detectors for a mission duration of 2 years .",
    "the resulting baseline instrumental configuration is summarized in table [ bpol_char ] .",
    ".main characteristics of the b - pol instrument [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the rejection of parasitic signals from the side lobes , together with the need of a full sky coverage and the need to avoid sun , earth and moon emission , led to choosing an l2 orbit for planck .",
    "the same considerations apply to b - pol .",
    "a soyuz launcher that would take off from kourou offers the most cost effective solution compatible with the instrument requirements .",
    "a lissajous orbit around l2 is preferred to a halo orbit because it is easier to control .",
    "it can be phased to avoid eclipses for the entire duration of the mission and can cope with larger payload masses . the mission would last 2 to 4 years depending on the actual cryogenic performance .",
    "the transfer from earth to l2 would last 2 to 4 months .",
    "the calibration and performance verification phase would last 2 months . to achieve optimal sky coverage and redundancy ( both in terms of hits per pixel and angular coverage )",
    ", b - pol uses a complex scan that consists of a precession about the anti - solar axis and a nutation about this precession axis , very much like the wmap mission .",
    "these two motions , with adequately related rotation periods ensure a large sky coverage ( @xmath26 ) over a short timescale ( @xmath27  days ) which together with a shorter ( @xmath28  seconds ) polarization modulation is optimal for @xmath29 noise and instrumental drifts rejection . inflight calibrations are required to correct for gain , polarization angle , differential gain of bolometer pairs , and contamination factors for each receiver ( @xmath30 into @xmath31  &  @xmath32 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 mixing ) .",
    "such calibration is achieved using a set of polarized and unpolarized sky sources observed throughout the entire mission .",
    "onboard artificial sources are also envisaged for more frequent calibration transfer .",
    "the search and discovery of primordial b modes provide a unique window for exploring new physics near the planck scale .",
    "there are no competing experimental probes able to access this domain .",
    "we have presented an implementation of a cmb polarization mission called b - pol that fits within the tight requirements for medium - size missions within the esa cosmic - vision 2015 - 2025 program .",
    "the instrument would survey the sky from the lagrangian point l2 of the sun - earth system for two years , and produce maps of the _ polarized _ microwave background anisotropy with sensitivity to @xmath33 two orders of magnitude better than planck .",
    "b - pol would explore the entire parameter space spanned by the `` large - field '' inflationary models , and consequently is capable to measure the energy scale of inflation . if , as suggested by current cmb and large scale galaxy surveys , the power spectrum of primordial perturbations is not exactly scale invariant , then in a wide class of inflationary models the level of gravitational waves will lie well within the range probed by b - pol .",
