    "lattice investigations of hadronic structure require the calculation of hadronic matrix elements of composite operators . in general , one has to convert the bare lattice operators into renormalized continuum operators by multiplication with the appropriate renormalization coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "the accuracy of perturbative calculations of these @xmath0 factors remains uncertain , even if tadpole improvement @xcite is used , as more than a one - loop computation is rarely available .",
    "therefore a nonperturbative calculation by monte carlo simulations appears to be an attractive alternative @xcite .",
    "we have performed such a computation for operators that determine moments of hadronic structure functions .",
    "computing the @xmath0 factors for a rather large range of renormalization scales we try to find out at which scales ( if at all ) perturbative behavior sets in such that the multiplication with perturbative wilson coefficients makes sense . for further details and results",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use standard wilson fermions in the quenched approximation . at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 )",
    "we work on a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) lattice . for both @xmath5 s",
    "we have studied three values of the hopping parameter @xmath6 .    in this talk , we shall concentrate on one particular example , namely the operator @xmath7{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!4}$ } } - \\frac{1}{3 } \\sum_{i=1}^3     \\gamma_i { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!i}$ } } \\right )   q \\,,\\ ] ] ( @xmath8 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) whose hadronic matrix elements are proportional to the momentum fraction @xmath9 carried by the quarks . working with wilson fermions",
    "it is straightforward to write down a lattice version of the above operator .",
    "one simply replaces the continuum covariant derivative by its lattice analogue .",
    "we follow the procedure proposed by martinelli et al .  @xcite .",
    "it applies the definitions used in ( continuum ) perturbation theory to vertex functions calculated by monte carlo simulations on the lattice . to be more specific",
    ", we calculate the quark - quark green function ( a matrix in color and dirac space ) with one insertion of the operator @xmath10 at momentum zero in the landau gauge . amputating the external quark legs we obtain the vertex function @xmath11 as a function of the quark momentum @xmath12 . defining the renormalized vertex function by @xmath13 we fix the renormalization constant @xmath14 by imposing the condition @xmath15 at @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the renormalization scale .",
    "so we calculate @xmath14 from @xmath18 with @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the born term in the vertex function of @xmath10 computed on the lattice , and @xmath20 denotes the quark field renormalization constant .",
    "the latter is calculated from the quark propagator @xmath21 : @xmath22 again at @xmath16 .",
    "( [ defz ] ) defines a renormalization scheme of the momentum subtraction type , which we call mom scheme . in order to convert our results into the more popular @xmath23 scheme we have to perform a finite renormalization .",
    "the corresponding renormalization constant @xmath24 is computed in continuum perturbation theory using dimensional regularization .",
    "neglecting quark masses we obtain in the landau gauge @xmath25 + o(g^4 ) \\ , ,     \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 for the gauge group su(3 ) . because of the noncovariance of the condition ( [ defz ] ) , @xmath24 depends on the direction of the momentum @xmath12 .    for the scale dependence ,",
    "the renormalization group predicts ( at fixed bare parameters ) @xmath27 in terms of the running coupling @xmath28 , the @xmath5-function @xmath29 , and the anomalous dimension @xmath30 .",
    "an analogous formula describes the @xmath5 dependence at fixed renormalized quantities .",
    "calculating the necessary two- and three - point functions with the help of momentum sources @xcite we achieve small statistical errors with a moderate number of configurations . after extrapolating to the chiral limit ( linearly in @xmath31 ) we multiply by @xmath32 .",
    "for the presentation of our results we convert lattice units to physical units using @xmath33 gev@xmath34 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath35 gev@xmath34 ( @xmath2 ) as determined from the string tension @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 parameter is taken to be @xmath37 mev .",
    "the scale dependence of our @xmath0 s should be described by the renormalization group factor @xmath38 ( see ( [ rengroup ] ) ) .",
    "hence we divide our numerical results by this expression ( evaluated in two - loop approximation with @xmath39 gev@xmath34 ) and define @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 we hope to obtain a @xmath17 independent answer , at least in a reasonable window of @xmath17 values .",
    "there @xmath42 would be large enough to allow for perturbative scaling behavior .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath42 should be small enough to avoid strong cut - off effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.r.v2b ] we plot @xmath41 versus the renormalization scale @xmath42 for our operator @xmath10 .",
    "the errors are purely statistical . a `` flat '' region seems to start at @xmath43 gev@xmath34 . note that the @xmath1 data and the ( perturbatively rescaled ) @xmath2 data agree except for the lowest values of @xmath42 .",
    "this indicates that the observed @xmath17 dependence is physical . for other operators ,",
    "the results look qualitatively similar , although in most cases a window starts only at @xmath44 gev@xmath34 , where it is hard to believe that cut - off effects are negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we compare the nonperturbative values for @xmath0 in the @xmath45 scheme with ( tadpole improved ) one - loop lattice perturbation theory .",
    "we plot the results for all operators with derivatives studied in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath46 versus @xmath47 , the number of derivatives .",
    "one - loop perturbation theory underestimates the increase of @xmath0 with @xmath47 .",
    "tadpole improvement works in the right direction for @xmath48 without being quantitatively satisfactory .",
    "however , the differences between the three methods decrease as @xmath5 ( and @xmath42 ) becomes larger .",
    "in summary , we have performed a comprehensive study of nonperturbative renormalization for various operators in the framework of lattice qcd .",
    "twist-2 operators appearing in unpolarized ( polarized ) deep - inelastic scattering have been studied for all spins @xmath49 ( @xmath50 )  @xcite .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath0 for the operator considered in this talk agrees with perturbative expectations to a good approximation already for moderate values of @xmath42 .",
    "however , most of the other operators containing covariant derivatives seem to approach perturbative scaling only for rather large values of the renormalization scale where cut - off effects might contaminate the results .",
    "the behavior at smaller @xmath42 could be nonperturbative physics , but at present we can not exclude the possibility that it is faked , e.g. , by finite - size effects . in any case , it might not always be sensible to combine these nonperturbative @xmath0 s with perturbative wilson coefficients using a scale of , say , @xmath51 gev@xmath34 .",
    "we have therefore started a nonperturbative calculation of the wilson coefficients .",
    "first results are reported in ref .",
