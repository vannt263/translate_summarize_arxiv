    "gallay , r. joly , and the author @xcite ) , and that it was shown that this structure is sufficient ( in itself , that is without the use of the maximum principle ) to prove results of global convergence towards travelling fronts .",
    "these ideas have been applied since in different contexts , for instance by g. chapuisat @xcite , muratov and m. novaga @xcite , n. d. alikakos and n. i. katzourakis @xcite , c. luo @xcite .",
    "even more recently , the same ideas enabled the author ( @xcite ) to push one step further ( that is , extend to systems ) the program initiated by p. c. fife and j. macleod in the late seventies with the aim of describing the global asymptotic behaviour ( when space is one - dimensional ) of every _",
    "bistable _ solution , that is every solution close to stable homogeneous equilibria at both ends of space ( @xcite ) . under generic assumptions on the potential @xmath3",
    ", these solutions approach a stacked ( possibly empty ) family of bistable travelling fronts at both ends of space , and approach in between a pattern of stationary solutions going slowly away from one another .",
    "these stacked families of fronts are called _ terraces _ by some authors ( see @xcite , where new results of the same flavour were recently obtained in the scalar case @xmath37 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend to the case of radially symmetric solutions in higher space dimensions the results ( description of the global asymptotic behaviour ) obtained in @xcite for bistable solutions when spatial domain is one - dimensional .",
    "thus we are going to consider solutions of system [ syst_higher_dim ] ( in higher spatial dimension @xmath9 ) that are altogether radially symmetric and stable at infinity ( in space ) . or equivalently solutions of system [ syst_rad_sym ] that approach a stable homogeneous equilibrium when the radius @xmath38 approaches @xmath5 .",
    "our aim is to prove that , under generic assumptions on the potential , these solutions approach a stacked family of ( radially symmetric ) bistable front going to infinity ( a `` propagating terrace '' ) , and behind these travelling fronts a pattern of stationary solutions going slowly away from one another ( a `` standing terrace '' ) .",
    "unfortunately , the results that we were able to reach at this stage only achieve the first step of this program ( ) , and few information will be given concerning the behaviour of the solution behind the propagating terrace ( ) .",
    "in the early eighties , the global behaviour of radially symmetric solutions of reaction - diffusion equations ( in the scalar case @xmath37 ) has been studied by several authors , in particular c. r. c. t. jones and k. uchiyama , @xcite .",
    "they extended a number of results that had been established for similar equations on the real line , concerning global convergence towards monostable or bistable fronts , and threshold phenomena ( always with the use of the maximum principle ) .",
    "an extensive study of threshold phenomena for radially symmetric solutions was recently provided by muratov and zhong , @xcite .",
    "the present paper can be viewed as a first attempt to extend some of those results ( bistable setting only ) to the more general case of systems ( and thus without the maximum principle ) .",
    "the path of the proof is very similar to the one used in the spatial dimension one case , @xcite .",
    "it is based on a careful study of the relaxation properties of energy or @xmath39 functionals ( localized in space by adequate weight functions ) , both in the laboratory frame and in frames travelling at various speeds .",
    "the differences are mainly of technical nature , they are related to the two following specific features of the ( reduced ) system [ syst_rad_sym ] :    * the `` curvature '' term @xmath40 ( which fortunately approaches zero when the radius @xmath38 approaches plus infinity ) ; * the fact that space is reduced to the half - line @xmath41 ( thus is in this sense less `` homogeneous '' than the full real line ) .",
    "observe that , due to these two features , the gradient structure in every travelling frame does not persist , strictly speaking , for the reduced system [ syst_rad_sym ] : the additional curvature term is not of gradient type , and in a travelling frame the space domain itself depends on time",
    ". only for @xmath38 approaching plus infinity do we recover ( asymptotically ) the gradient structures in travelling frames .",
    "the whole paper is thus nothing but an attempt to show that the proof set up in @xcite can be adapted to the case of system [ syst_rad_sym ] , in other words that the two technical difficulties above can be overcome .",
    "this section presents strong similarities with sections of @xcite and of @xcite , where more details and comments can be found .    for the remaining of the paper",
    "it will be assumed than the space dimension @xmath9 is not smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "indeed the case @xmath43 was already treated in @xcite , and several definitions , estimates , and statements will turn out to be irrelevant without this assumption ( see for instance the definition of the weight function @xmath44 in ) .",
    "let us consider the two following banach spaces of continuous and uniformly bounded functions equipped with the uniform norm : @xmath45 system [ syst_higher_dim ] defines a local semi - flow in @xmath46 ( see for instance d. b. henry s book @xcite ) .    as in @xcite ,",
