    "within the last decade , numerical simulations have substantially increased in performance and accuracy contributing to what has been denominated the new era of precision cosmology . statistical measures such as the matter power spectrum",
    "can now be calculated to sub - percent level precision , making it possible to obtain competitive constraints of fundamental cosmological parameters with galaxy surveys .",
    "this precision is , however , only obtained in a regime where structure formation behaves in a regular , strictly hierarchical way , owing to a well behaved linear power spectrum with a close to power - law scaling .",
    "as soon as this basic assumption is relaxed , standard numerical methods are not guaranteed to work anymore . in the case of a suppressed power spectrum , as it appears prominently in hot and warm dark matter models , standard numerical methods produce artefacts near the suppression scale by enhancing small non - physical modes present in the initial conditions @xcite .    along with the development of numerical schemes , analytical techniques such as the extended press - schechter ( eps ) approach @xcite and the halo model",
    "@xcite have been put forward to describe nonlinear structure formation .",
    "they do not achieve the same precision than numerical simulations , but they provide qualitative understanding of the physical processes involved and they have the advantage of not requiring big computer facilities .",
    "however , these analytical techniques again only work in the case of a reasonably behaved initial power spectrum with nearly power - law scaling .",
    "as soon as the initial power spectrum is significantly suppressed , standard eps approaches and subsequently the halo model fail to predict the right clustering @xcite .",
    "understanding structure formation of cosmologies with suppressed perturbations is not merely an academical exercise but a necessity in order to capture the full range of scales of cosmic clustering . as a matter of fact ,",
    "all reasonable dark matter ( dm ) scenarios exhibit a suppression of perturbations below a certain scale either due to particle free - streaming or due to interactions in the early universe .",
    "for the prime dm candidate , the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , the mass scale of suppression lies somewhere between roughly @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath1 depending on the specific model parameters @xcite , which is orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest galaxies we observe .",
    "other promising dm candidates such as the sterile neutrino or the gravitino have higher primordial velocities , pushing the regime of power suppression to larger scales where it becomes relevant for galaxy surveys such as in the case of warm or mixed dm .",
    "more exotic scenarios like interacting dm @xcite , self - interacting dm @xcite , asymmetric dm @xcite , or ultra - light axion dm @xcite can also lead to suppressed power at rather large scales either because they interact with the cosmic plasma , with dark radiation or because they undergo scalar field oscillations on astrophysical scales .",
    "since the power suppression of different dm scenarios happens at different scales and is of varying shape , it is crucial to properly quantify the nonlinear clustering in this regime in order to distinguish between different dm species and to contribute towards a solution of one of the outstanding puzzles in modern physics .    in this paper",
    "we study nonlinear structure formation starting from initial power spectra with arbitrary small - scale suppressions . as working examples",
    ", we investigate the cases of warm dm , mixed dm , wimp dm , and pure cold dm .",
    "we run a suite of @xmath3-body simulations for these models and carefully remove artificial structures which tend to populate simulations of suppressed initial power . at the same time , we develop an extended press - schechter method able to cope with arbitrary linear power spectra .",
    "we then calculate important quantities , such as the halo mass function , the number of satellites , and the concentration - mass relation of halo profiles .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmmodels ] we give a short overview of different dm scenarios and discuss how they suppress perturbations .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] contains a summary of the simulations and analysis techniques including a discussion about subtracting artefacts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eps ] and [ sec : concentrations ] we present our modified press - schechter approach and use it to predict mass function , number of milky - way satellites and concentrations . finally , we conclude in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] and give further details about the removal of artefacts in the appendix .",
    "the physical mechanisms leading to the power suppression below a certain scale depend on the dark matter ( dm ) candidate but is usually either particle free - streaming , tiny interactions with the primordial plasma , or more exotic phenomena in the early universe .",
    "both the scale and the detailed shape of the suppression strongly vary depending on the characteristics of the dm particle , i.e. its mass , momentum , and interaction cross - sections . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the most common dm scenarios and outline their effects on nonlinear structure formation .",
    "dark matter models with a steep cutoff - suppression at dwarf galaxy scales , similar in shape to the one obtained from particles with a fermi - dirac momentum distribution , are usually referred to as warm dm ( wdm ) .",
    "typical power spectra of wdm models are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] ( red , cyan , purple , and pink lines ) .",
    "implicitly , the wdm regime is defined to lie in the rather narrow band where the suppression of perturbation has a significant effect on dwarf galaxy formation but is still in agreement with observations .",
    "furthermore , wdm is generally assumed to reduce potential small - scale inconsistencies , such as the _ missing satellite _ or the _ too big to fail _ problem , occurring in a @xmath4cdm universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review on these topics ) .",
    "recent studies point out that both requirements  passing observational constraints and alleviating small scale inconsistencies  seem impossible to combine because constraints from lyman-@xmath5 are prohibitively strong in the case of wdm @xcite . while some question the accuracy of the lyman-@xmath5 measurements , more and more people believe that the small - scale inconsistencies are a consequence of poorly understood baryonic processes of galaxy formation @xcite .    however , it is possible and worthwhile to use structure formation in order to find upper limits on the scale of dm suppression .",
    "the strongest constraints currently come from flux observations of the lyman-@xmath5 forest ruling out particle masses below @xmath6 kev at the 2-@xmath7 confidence level @xcite .",
    "other limits are obtained from dwarf galaxy counts disfavouring particle masses below @xmath8 kev @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 refers to the equivalent thermal mass , assuming a fermi - dirac momentum distribution .",
    "the prime candidate for wdm is the hypothetical sterile ( or right - handed ) neutrino , which can be readily added to the standard model .",
    "sterile neutrinos are well motivated because they provide an explanation for the measured mixing angles of active neutrinos , and because all other fermions exist with both left and right chirality @xcite .",
    "the particle mass of sterile neutrino dm is expected to lie in the kev - range , what makes it an ideal candidate for warm or lukewarm dark matter depending on the suppression scale which is governed by particle mass and momentum distribution .",
    "the recent tentative discovery of an x - ray line at 3.5 kev from galaxy clusters and m31 by two independent research groups @xcite might provide additional motivation for sterile neutrino dm . since sterile neutrinos decay radiatively , the confirmation of such a signal would be a smoking gun for a @xmath10 kev particle , which would translate into a thermal mass of @xmath11 kev depending on the production mechanism in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the measured x - ray line is , however , disputed , since there are some conflicting bounds from galaxies where the signal is not measured ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "better astronomical data is needed to check if the signal is real and if the flux coincides with the expectations from decaying dm .      in principle , dark matter can be made of two or more particle species with different properties .",
    "particularly interesting in terms of structure formation is a mixture of cold with warm or hot dm .",
    "this leads to qualitatively different initial power spectra with gradual suppression over many orders of magnitude in scale in contrary to the steep cutoff known from wdm .",
    "the effect is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] , where we plot the dimensionless power spectra of different mixed dm ( mdm ) scenarios ( consisting of a cdm part and a thermal wdm part with @xmath12 kev ) with increasing mixing fraction @xmath13 .",
    "the concept of mdm is neither new nor particularly exotic .",
    "in fact , it is clear that there must be more than one dm component since neutrinos are known to have non - zero mass .",
    "current observations constrain the sum of neutrino masses to the range of @xmath14 ev @xcite , yielding a mixing fraction @xmath15 .",
    "however , the very small neutrino masses result in an evenly damped power spectrum at all relevant scales for halo formation , very similar to the case of pure cdm with low @xmath16-normalisation @xcite .    instead of two ( or more ) distinct particles acting as dm components , mdm - like compositions can also arise due to multi - channel dm production in the early universe , yielding momentum distributions that mimic the case of several dm components .",
    "prime example is again the sterile neutrino which can be produced via resonant oscillations with active neutrinos @xcite , where some subdominant part is always produced out of resonance leading to particle momenta from two overlapping distributions @xcite",
    ". the effect can be even stronger if the sterile neutrinos with nonzero mixing angle are produced via the decay of heavy scalars yielding a momentum distribution with two distinct peaks @xcite .",
    "the most popular group of dark matter candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) with the neutralino as prime candidate .",
    "the popularity of wimp dm comes from the fact that such particles naturally appear in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , and that they are produced via thermal freeze - out at roughly the right amount to account for the observed dm abundance ( this is usually referred to as the _ wimp miracle _ , see * ? ? ? * for a summary ) .",
    "as wimps are heavy ( with particle masses in the gev or tev scales ) and weakly interacting , they become non - relativistic very early leading to extremely small suppression scales . depending on the parameters of the model",
    ", the mass scale of wimp dm suppression is expected to lie between roughly @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath1 @xcite .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] we plot the power spectra of neutralino dm with a mass of @xmath17 ( brown line ) and @xmath18 gev ( orange line ) and corresponding decoupling temperatures of @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev .",
    "these spectra are compared to the hypothetical case of pure cdm ( black line ) .",
    "the suppression of power in wimp scenarios happens at very high wave - numbers roughly following an exponential cutoff @xcite .",
    "we will show later on that such wimp models suppress structure formation at a halo mass of about @xmath21 @xmath1 .",
    "there are many more dm candidates with variable suppression scales depending on their interaction and free streaming properties .",
    "for example , dm can be self - interacting , as in the case of atomic or mirror dm @xcite , or it can interact with photons @xcite and neutrinos @xcite all yielding strong suppression of small - scale modes . other possibilities with similar effects on small scales are decaying dm @xcite , later - forming dm @xcite , or ultra - light axion dm @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to obtain suppressed small - scale perturbations from effects not related to dark matter .",
    "inflation could lead to a running of the spectral index , gradually reducing power on small scales @xcite , or it could induce a strong cutoff similarly to the case of wdm @xcite .",
    "we run and analyse numerical simulations of different resolution with linear power spectra representing cold , warm , mixed , and wimp dark matter ( dm ) scenarios .",
    "the initial conditions are generated from the linear power spectra illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] , which are selected to cover different scales of power suppression as well as a variety of shapes from steep cutoffs to shallow decreases towards large wave - numbers .",
    "the linear power spectra have been calculated with the boltzmann solver class @xcite , which comes with an option for multiple dm species of arbitrary mass and momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "we use cosmological parameters obtained by planck , i.e @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "the simulations are performed with pkdgrav2 @xcite , applying a standard force softening of 1/50 times the mean particle separation . for the halo",
    "finding , we use ahf with particle unbinding and an over - density criterion corresponding to spherical tophat collapse @xcite .",
    "a list summarising the main characteristics of the simulations is given in table [ sims ] .",
    "most of the runs suffer from artificial clumping at the scale of suppressed perturbations .",
    "this is not only the case for wdm , where the effect has been observed many times before , but also for wimp - dm and even for the mdm scenarios with initial power spectra that never drop to zero . in the next sections ,",
    "we discuss the issue of artificial halo formation in more detail , and we discuss how artefact can be filtered out of halo catalogues from numerical simulations .      artificial clumping is a serious problem in simulations where the initial power is suppressed below a characteristic scale , usually referred to as the free - streaming or damping scale .",
    "standard n - body techniques can not cope with this setup and produce many small - scale haloes that are resolution dependent and therefore non - physical @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the artificial clumping does not only happen in setups with a steep cutoff and zero physical power below a certain scale , but also in mdm scenarios , where the suppression of perturbations is much smoother and the power spectrum never drops to zero .",
    "recently , there has been attempts to overcome the problem of artefacts with a novel n - body technique tracking the dark matter sheet in phase - space @xcite . with this method , the amount of artificial haloes in wdm simulations",
    "is drastically reduced @xcite .",
    "the method is , however , not fully operational yet , since it has difficulties to cope with high - density regions , where the six - dimensional phase - space sheet undergoes multiple foldings .",
    "further studies seem needed in order evaluate whether this promising method can be improved to simultaneously deal with artificial clumping and accurately calculate regions of high density .",
    "in this paper we use a standard n - body technique combined with a post - processing method to identify and remove artificial haloes from the halo catalogue .",
    "the method is explained in the following section .",
    "several methods of different complexity to identify artificial haloes have been proposed in the past . @xcite",
    "removed haloes on the basis of visual inspection , @xcite suggested to subtract a power - law component in the halo mass function , @xcite identified artefacts by measuring the spin of haloes found with the friends - of - friends technique . the most complex and arguably most complete method to remove artefacts has been proposed by @xcite , using both the shape of proto - haloes in the initial conditions ( i.e. the volume spanned by all particles ending up in a halo ) as well as their overlap between realisations with different resolution . in a first step ,",
    "@xcite measured the sphericity of proto - haloes , removing all objects that are unusually elongated .",
    "this selection criterion is based on the observation that artefacts originate from the collapse of larger modes to walls and filaments , pushing already aligned particles together until they cluster into non - physical clumps . in a second step , they analysed the resolution dependence of haloes , removing all objects that do not appear in two simulations of the same initial field but different resolution",
    ".     +    in this paper , we use a similar method than the one proposed by @xcite and apply it to cosmological simulations .",
    "this is more challenging than the original application which was limited to substructures within a milky - way - size host haloes . in our case",
    "we use a less stringent limit of 1000 particles for the minimal halo size , which means that we have up to a quarter of a million haloes per simulation with masses spanning more than four orders of magnitude .",
    "these haloes are in varying large - scale surroundings and at different stages of their evolution , making it hard to reliably separate real haloes from artefacts . in the following ,",
    "we show that although no perfect separation is possible , most artefacts can be reliably identified while only a small fraction of real haloes is erroneously removed .",
    "we use the simulations with the fewest and the most artefacts  the cdm and the wdm ( @xmath12 kev ) run  to illustrate the method and estimate the efficiency of filtering out artefacts without erroneously removing physical haloes .",
    "further information on how halo catalogues of the remaining dm models are affected by the method is provided in the appendix .",
    "the first step of the algorithm consist of measuring the ellipticity of proto - haloes in the initial conditions ( ics ) using the inertia tensor @xmath31 where the sum goes over all the proto - halo particles and @xmath32 is the kroenecker delta .",
    "the vector @xmath33 corresponds to the particle position with respect to the centre - of - mass of the proto - halo .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath34 are directly related to the axis @xmath35 of an ellipsoid with the same inertia tensor .",
    "this means it is possible to define the axis ratios @xmath36 and @xmath37 providing a measure of the proto - halo sphericity is used to distinguish between artefacts and real hales .",
    "we find it advantageous to use both @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the filtering procedure .",
    "] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : halohistogram ] we show histograms of haloes with ellipticity parameters @xmath38 ( blue ) and @xmath39 ( red ) .",
    "the top row corresponds to the cases of cdm ( left ) and wdm with @xmath12 kev ( right ) .",
    "while for cdm both parameters follow approximately gaussian distributions , the wdm case exhibits secondary peaks at low values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is a clear indication for the presence of an artificial population of haloes with very elongated proto - haloes .",
    "the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : halohistogram ] illustrates the same statistics for the mdm models with mixing factor @xmath40 ( left ) , @xmath41 ( middle ) , and @xmath42 ( right ) .",
    "the distributions do not show secondary peaks , but they are considerably broader and shifted towards lower values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 than in the case of cdm , indicating the presence of a subpopulation of artefacts in these models as well .    based on the information of fig .",
    "[ fig : halohistogram ] , we set cuts of @xmath43 and @xmath44 on the halo samples , removing all objects with smaller ellipticity parameters in all dm models .",
    "we will call this the _ spericity cut _ in the following . in the wdm model ,",
    "the values @xmath45 and @xmath46 lie at the minimum between the two peaks of real and artificial haloes , filtering out 60 percent of all haloes . in the case of cdm ,",
    "on the other hand , the same values remove less than 5 percent of all haloes .",
    "this is a small loss considering the fact that changing the halo - finder can translate into ten percent differences in the abundance of haloes @xcite .",
    "the second step of the algorithm consists of additionally filtering out haloes with a poor match between simulations of the same initial field but different resolution .",
    "we again follow @xcite and define the merit function @xmath47 for every proto - halo , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the proto - halo volumes in the low resolution ( lr ) and high resolution ( hr ) simulations , and where @xmath50 is the overlap of the two ( i.e the shared volume ) .",
    "the merit function can be computed with any standard merger - tree algorithm based on particle ids ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as they can be used to link haloes between different simulations .",
    "since standard merger - tree codes require the same particle numbers between analysed snapshots , we formally increase the particle number of the lr output by splitting every lr particle into @xmath51 particles corresponding to the hr particles of the same phase - space volume .",
    "this simple trick allows us to use the publicly available code mergertree ( out of the ahf - package , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to calculate the number of shared particles between all haloes in the lr and hr simulations .",
    "this then trivially leads to the merit function of eq .  [ merit ] since every particle can be related to a small volume element in the initial conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : halohistogram2 ] we illustrate the histograms of haloes with respect to the merit function @xmath52 for cdm ( black ) , wdm ( red ) , and mdm ( blue , green , and magenta ) .",
    "the top panel shows all haloes with more than 1000 particles , i.e before applying the _",
    "spehricity cut_. while the cdm distribution only exhibits one distinct peak at @xmath53 , the wdm distribution has a peak at @xmath54 plus a secondary , much broader feature at @xmath55 which can be attributed to artefacts .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : halohistogram2 ] shows the same statistics for the haloes which are not filtered out by the _ sphericity cut_. while the cdm distribution does hardly change , the broad feature at low @xmath52 in wdm is substantially smaller , indicating that most of the artefacts have already been filtered out .",
    "however , some artefacts survive the _ sphericity cut _ and still contribute to the histograms of the bottom panel .",
    "this is emphasised by the relative excess of wdm and mdm haloes at low values of @xmath52 .    in order to filter out the remaining artefacts visible in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : halohistogram2 ] , we use the statistics of the merit function to apply a second selection cut of @xmath56 ( illustrated by the grey dashed line ) which we will call the _ resolution cut_. this further removal should capture most of remaining artefacts , while keeping the majority of the real haloes in the sample . for the cases of cdm and wdm the _ resolution cut _",
    "filters out an additional 15 and 40 percent of the remaining haloes .    in summary ,",
    "we note that applying solely the _ sphericity cut _ leads to rather conservative results in the sense that cdm haloes are hardly affected , but it does not filter out all of the wdm ( and mdm ) artefacts . applying both the _ sphericity _ and the _ resolution cut _ filters out more artefacts , but it also removes some of the real objects .",
    "the halo mass function of fig .  [ fig : massfct ] illustrates how the method of removing artefacts affects the total halo abundance at different masses .",
    "empty and filled symbols illustrate the mass function before and after the removal of haloes . filled symbols appear twice illustrating the effect of only applying the _",
    "sphericity cut _",
    "( upper symbols ) and both the _ sphericity _ and _ resolution cut _ ( lower symbols ) . the coloured area in between therefore illustrates the inherent uncertainty of the method .",
    "many aspects of nonlinear structure formation can be analytically described by the extended press - schechter ( eps ) approach , which assumes linear growth of perturbations followed by immediate halo formation above a certain threshold ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the threshold is derived from an idealised spherical or ellipsoidal collapse calculation . despite of these oversimplified assumption ,",
    "the eps model is able to reproduce fundamental statistics of structure formation , such as halo mass function , accretion history or bias @xcite .",
    "this is , however , only true for a pure cdm scenario where the initial power spectrum behaves as a quasi power - law which is never steeper than @xmath57 .",
    "as soon as the initial power spectrum is suppressed further ( i.e. becomes steeper than @xmath57 ) , the standard eps model completely fails to predict the right clustering . in this section ,",
    "we show how the formalism needs to be adapted in order to give adequate predictions for cosmologies with arbitrary initial power spectra including steep cutoffs or gradual suppressions .",
    "we thereby follow and extend the method developed in @xcite .",
    "the most used application and the starting point of the eps model is the halo mass function . in the standard scenario",

    "the first crossing distribution @xmath61 is obtained with the excursion - set approach , which follows random walk trajectories counting events of first up - crossing of the collapse threshold @xcite .",

    "other common choices for @xmath75 are a sharp-@xmath78 filter ( a tophat function in fourier space ) or a gaussian filter @xcite .",
    "the usual recipe to construct the eps halo mass function consists of combining eq .",

    "motivated by this discrepancy at the largest scales , @xcite heuristically modified the first - crossing distribution by setting @xmath80 , what leads to very good agreement with simulations over all mass scales , but it technically consists of allowing for one free parameter .",
    "this modified model is commonly referred to as the sheth - tormen mass function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : massfct ] we show the expected good agreement between the sheth - tormen mass function ( dotted lines ) and simulations of a cdm cosmology ( black squares ) , which holds over a wide range of halo masses and redshifts . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : massfct ] also shows the complete failure of the sheth - tormen mass function to reproduce the halo abundance of wdm , mdm or wimp dm simulations ( coloured symbols ) around the scale of suppression ( the coloured area between the two sets of filled symbols designate the uncertainty in the method to filter out artificial haloes , the empty symbols illustrate the raw data , including real haloes and artefacts ; see sec .",

    "the inability of the standard eps approach to model cosmologies with suppressed power spectra has been reported by several papers in the past @xcite , and different methods to solve this problem have been proposed .",

    "this possibility was initially discussed in a paper by @xcite and has been adapted to wdm by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason why the sharp-@xmath78 filter does a better job than the standard top - hat filter lies in the asymptotic behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) towards small radii . with a sharp-@xmath78 filter , this integral naturally depends on the shape of the power spectrum for any radius . with a top - hat filter , on the other hand ,",
    "the integral becomes completely insensitive to the shape of the power spectrum as soon as the latter decreases faster than @xmath57 .",
    "instead , the mass function becomes solely driven by the shape of the filter function and strongly deviates from the halo abundance in simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed discussion ) .    for the case of a sharp-@xmath78 filter , the functional form of the halo mass function ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ sepsmassfct ] ) can be further simplified .",

    "( [ stfirstcrossing ] ) , ( [ variance ] ) , and ( [ sharpkfilter ] ) as well as with an appropriate relation between filter scale and mass , we get a closed set of equations yielding the halo number density per mass scale .",
    "the sharp-@xmath78 filter has an important drawback we havent discussed so far , namely that it has no well defined mass @xmath52 associated to its filter scale @xmath84 .",
    "this means that , apart from the proportionality @xmath85 due to the spherical symmetry of the filter , the halo mass is unconstrained . introducing a free parameter @xmath86 ,",
    "the relation between filter scale and mass can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 gives the best match to simulations . ] .",
    "the calibration of the parameter @xmath86 is done once and does not change for different dm scenarios .",
    "the sharp-@xmath78 model has two main advantages compared to the standard eps approach : first , it consistently uses the same filter ( the sharp-@xmath78 function ) for the entire excursion - set calculation , while the eps approach usually relies on the sharp-@xmath78 filter to calculate the first crossing distribution and on the tophat filter to connect it to the number density of haloes .",
    "second , the sharp-@xmath78 method is based on the original first - crossing distribution from ellipsoidal collapse , while the sheth - tormen model introduces a heuristic parameter adjustment .",
    "the second advantage is counterbalanced by the fact that the sharp-@xmath78 filter does not have a well defined mass . at the end , both the sharp-@xmath78 and the sheth - tormen model have one free parameter , which needs to be adjusted to simulations .    the halo mass function from the simulations ( symbols ) , the sheth - tormen model ( dashed lines ) , and the sharp-@xmath78 model ( solid lines ) are all plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : massfct ] . for the case of cdm ( black ) ,",
    "the sharp-@xmath78 mass function closely follows both the simulation measurements and the sheth - tormen model . for the case of wdm (",
    "red , cyan , purple , pink ) , mdm ( green , magenta , blue ) , and wimp dm ( brown , orange ) , the sharp-@xmath78 mass function gives a reasonably good match to simulations , while the sheth - tormen approach fails to match the flattening or the turnaround visible in simulations .",
    "in @xcite the sharp-@xmath78 model has been reported to underestimate the halo abundance when the suppression scale lies in the exponential tail of the halo mass function ( i.e. for @xmath89 ) , which generally happens at very high redshift .",
    "it turns out , however , that this discrepancy between the sharp-@xmath78 model and the data is greatly reduced for haloes defined by a spherical overdensity instead of a friends - of - friends linking criterion ( see * ? ? ?",
