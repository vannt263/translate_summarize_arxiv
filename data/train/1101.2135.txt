    "problems of communication are at the centre of attention of several branches of sociology @xcite , with some overlaps from psychology to telecommunication . there , statistical physics has also a bridgehead @xcite , where ideas like agent simulations @xcite , social networks @xcite and evolutionary games @xcite are as common as non - equilibrium processes @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite . despite this interest",
    ", a split remains between social sciences and sociophysics @xcite , because different aspects of reality are qualified as interesting by researchers on both sides .",
    "it is worthwhile , then , for a sociophysicist to investigate a problem formulated by a social scientist ; in this way , the above split can be at least reduced .",
    "here we are interested in the problem how messages are received and accepted , as formulated by john zaller @xcite  the equations of zaller are briefly summarised also in 2-nd section of @xcite .",
    "although the mathematical formalism we use here differs from the original one , the core of the social process remains  we hope ",

    "[ sec - care ] for detailed description.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in this process , a community is subject to a stream of messages from media .",
    "they are noticed or not , depending on how their political content fits individual profiles of the receivers ; further , they are accepted or not on a similar basis .",
    "the model description by zaller @xcite was reformulated in @xcite in the spirit of the bounded confidence model @xcite , where messages are represented as points in the plane of issues . in the next step ,",
    "communication between agents was introduced to the model @xcite .",
    "this generalisation mate the approach even more close to the bounded confidence model , then it is justified to term it as the zaller  deffuant model . in both works",
    "@xcite , a community was subject to a stream of messages , where positive and negative opinions on a given issue appear with equal frequencies .",
    "the proper outcome of opinions should then be `` i do nt know '' , and the quality of the social performance can be measured by an evaluation of the variance @xmath0 of the opinion distribution . a large variance could be interpreted as many extreme opinions ; in this case , the performance is poor . on the contrary",
    ", a small variance means that most people remain undecided . in @xcite , where the communication between agents was absent ,",
    "the variance was found to be anti - correlated with the tolerance parameter @xmath1 , which measured an individual ability to receive / accept distant messages . in @xcite , an intensive exchange of messages between agents",
    "was demonstrated to lead to unanimity .",
    "this option was found to deteriorate the collective performance , by producing agents who are strongly convinced in their opinions . simply , the probabilities that an agent answers ` yes ' and ` no ' were always either one and zero or zero and one , but never a half and a half .",
    "this was a consequence of an effective attraction between agents on the plane of issues @xcite .",
    "paradoxically , for large values of the tolerance parameter @xmath1 the attraction was even more effective , and the deterioration of the performance was even stronger , than for small @xmath1 .",
    "below we consider a modification of the process .",
    "previously @xcite , the only criterion to receive a message by an agent is if the distance between this message and the ones received earlier does not exceed the given value of the tolerance parameter .",
    "now , agents address their messages to those neighbours which are most close in the plane of issues .",
    "there , the distance is between most close opinions .",
    "moreover , the tolerance parameter for the interpersonal messages is assumed to be twice larger than its value for the messages from media .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate , that this individualised way of communication destroys the unanimity . as a consequence ,",
    "the variance of opinions @xmath0 decreases monotonously with the mean value of the tolerance parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the message space is a square @xmath2 .",
    "initially , @xmath3 agents are randomly distributed inside this square at positions @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) .",
    "this set of agents is exposed to the stream of subsequent @xmath6 external messages , which appear on the message space at randomly selected positions @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "agent @xmath9 accepts information @xmath10 if any of his / her so far accepted messages @xmath11 is closer than @xmath1 to @xmath12 .    between each two external messages ,",
    "approximately ten messages are sent by randomly selected agents to their nearest neighbours , in the same way as in @xcite . to complete this , a nearest neighbour @xmath13 for each agent @xmath9 is detected . as noted above , distances are compared between nearest messages previously accepted by given agents .",
    "then each agent @xmath9 tries to send to his / her nearest neighbour @xmath13 this of so far accepted messages @xmath14 @xmath15 which is closest to the neighbour s information @xmath16 .",
    "if this selected and sent message @xmath14 is closer than @xmath17 to the set @xmath18 then it is accepted by @xmath13 as his / her @xmath19-th message @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] the schematic sketch of the messages space with initial agents distribution , their set of accepted messages and incoming messages are presented .",
    "the initial agents positions are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a dozen of subsequent messages appear at the positions @xmath26 . among them",
    "messages @xmath27 were neglected by all agents .",
    "the subsequent sets of messages @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 were accepted by agents @xmath31 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the solid lines represent the borders of agent s acceptance area for incoming messages .",
    "the dashed lines show the borders for interpersonal interaction ( information exchange ) among the nearest neighbours .",
    "messages @xmath32 and @xmath33 will be shared among agents @xmath34 as soon as the message @xmath35 arrives .    similarly to the procedure described in ref .",

    "note that while for one simulation the state of unanimity is characterized by a small variance , the variance averaged over populations with unanimous and extreme opinions is large . for comparison the same histogram for agents",

    "while many people believe that the content of laws of physics is free of values , the situation in sociology is much less clear @xcite . _ toutes proportions gardes _ , we can repeat the question of values , regarding our results . the unanimity can be treated as a valuable state , where long discussions do not destroy a coherent action .",
    "however , the condition of unanimity can also be a threat for individual freedom .",
    "as we see , values are to be selected on basis of individual experience and of demands of the situation .    in a recent work on a similar model , we evaluated the statistical meaningfulness of communities as dependent on the tolerance parameter @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we found , that the community structure is most meaningful when the overall communication is weak ; in this case social connections are rare but once some exist , they strongly determine the local behaviour .",
    "these results are parallel and supplementary to the results obtained here . as an integrated picture ,",
    "an opposition emerges : a common and uniform communication against a local one , unanimity against diversity of opinions , loose contacts with everybody or well - defined social clusters .",
    "the role of the parameter of tolerance remains ambiguous .",
    "when an interpersonal communication is absent , the tolerance improves understanding of messages from media @xcite , but in the presence of communication it can lead to unanimity around a random opinion @xcite .",
    "our main conclusion here is that individually addressed messages maintain the diversity .",
