    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process  ( asep ) has been widely studied in the past decades  @xcite .",
    "it is a nonequilibrium driven diffusive system of particles subject to the exclusion interaction . despite its simplicity ,",
    "the asep describes various nonequilibrium processes such as bio - polymerization  @xcite , surface growth  @xcite , traffic flow  @xcite , for example .",
    "furthermore , the asep in one dimension is exactly solvable via the bethe ansatz  @xcite and the matrix product ansatz  @xcite or direct solution of recursion relations  @xcite .",
    "the exact solution contributes to deeper understanding of fluctuation phenomena  @xcite and nonequilibrium phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "most studies on the asep have been performed on one - dimensional  ( 1d ) chains . on the other hand ,",
    "there are many quasi-1d systems which involve long - range links .",
    "if a polymer chain folds randomly , there arise contacts between different polymer segments which are far apart along a backbone  @xcite .",
    "those contacts can be regarded as long - range links for a transport process on a network of polymer chains .",
    "a gene regulatory protein diffuses along the dna chain to search for its target gene  @xcite .",
    "it can make a long - range jump by dissociation from and reassociation with the dna .",
    "recent studies show that real world traffic networks have a complex structure with long - range links  @xcite . in this respect , interests are growing in the study of the asep on complex networks  @xcite .    in this work , we address the question : what is the transport capacity of a complex network for particles interacting via mutual exclusion ? in order to contribute to this issue we consider the asep on a 1d chain with long - range links , called shortcuts , for open boundary conditions .",
    "it will turn out that the shortcuts cause a drastic change in the phase diagram of the asep .",
    "we start with a brief review of the 1d asep .",
    "the original model is defined on a 1d lattice .",
    "the lattice sites are either occupied by at most one particle or empty .",
    "multiple occupancy on a site is prohibited  [ exclusion interaction ] .",
    "particles may hop to the left and right with a bias to one direction  [ asep ] .",
    "a closely related equilibrium process is the so - called symmetric simple exclusion process  ( ssep ) where particles hop in both directions with equal rates . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the model has a trivial steady state where every microscopic configuration is equally likely irrespective of the hopping bias  @xcite .",
    "however , the bias is relevant for the dynamic scaling behavior . in the context of growing interfaces",
    ", the ssep belongs to the edward - wilkinson  ( ew ) universality class  @xcite , and the asep to the kardar - parisi - zhang  ( kpz ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "both classes are characterized by the power - law scaling @xmath9 between characteristic time and length scales .",
    "the scaling exponent is given by @xmath10 for the ew class and @xmath11 for the kpz class  @xcite .",
    "for open boundary conditions the chain is coupled to particle reservoirs at both ends .",
    "one acts as a particle source emitting particles at a rate @xmath3 , and the other as a sink absorbing particles at a rate @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the system driven by the open boundaries displays nonequilibrium phase transitions between low - density  ( ld ) , high - density  ( hd ) , and maximal - current  ( mc ) phases  @xcite .",
    "the system belongs to the ld phase if the capacity of the particle source @xmath3 controls the particle flux , i.e. if @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the hopping rate of the particles .",
    "the system belongs to the hd phase when the outgoing rate @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath3 and @xmath15 .",
    "the overall particle density is determined by the outgoing rate @xmath4 and there is a macroscopic congestion of particles .",
    "when both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are larger than @xmath15 , the capacity of the system is limited by the capacity of the bulk .",
    "such a phase is called the mc phase , where the overall particle density is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in the 1d asep ,",
    "particle hopping is a short - ranged process between neighboring sites .",
    "there are a few attempts to study the effect of a long - range hopping on the phase diagram of the asep for open boundary conditions .",
    "szavits - nossan and uzelac considered the asep with a probabilistic long - range hopping  @xcite .",
    "a particle can hop to any site at a distance @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 .",
    "they obtained that the phase diagram remains the same as that of the 1d asep for @xmath18 . for @xmath19 , however , the system does not display any phase transition .",
    "considered a boundary - driven 1d asep model where particles may perform a short - range hopping between nearest - neighbor sites or a long - range hopping  @xcite . upon a long - range hopping ,",
    "a particle jumps to an empty site directly behind a next particle in front of it .",
    "it was found that the long - range hopping introduces an instability towards a so - called empty - road phase .",
    "otwinowski and boettcher considered the asep on a one - dimensional chain decorated with hierarchically organized long - range links  @xcite .",
    "this model displays the ld and hd phases .",
    "besides , depending on the way the long - range hopping is implemented , an intermediate phase may also be realized .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the role of long - range hoppings in a driven system in a generic setting . for that purpose ,",
    "we study the asep on a 1d chain with open boundary conditions and additional long range links connecting randomly - selected pairs of sites .",
    "the result is a graph similar to a small - world network  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we couple this network to two particle reservoirs , a particle source connected to one boundary site and sink to another .",
    "in contrast to the 1d asep , particle source and sink now are connected via the small - world network .",
    "this setup describes a generic scenario for directed transport through a complex network with limited capacity .",
    "it is generally believed that long - range links make a system defined on a small - world network homogeneous  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our study shows that the system develops a localized shock which separates a 1d backbone into an empty region near the entrance and a fully - occupied region near the exit .",
    "such an inhomogeneity is caused by the interplay between the boundary driving and the long - range hopping .",
    "the steady - state position of the shock depends on the particle input and output rates , which results in an interesting phase diagram .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce a boundary - driven asep in a 1d chain with long - range links . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present numerical results obtained from monte carlo simulations . measuring the overall particle density @xmath8 , we obtain a numerical phase diagram which consists of an empty  ( e ) phase , a jammed  ( j ) phase , and a shock  ( s ) phase .",
    "the overall particle density takes the value of @xmath20 in the e  ( j ) phase , while it varies continuously in the s phase .",
    "the shock phase is characterized by a localized shock which separates a 1d backbone into empty and jammed domains . in order to understand the mechanism for the shock formation and the phase transition",
    ", we develop an approximate analytic theory .",
    "this is presented in sec .",
    "we summarize and conclude the paper in sec .",
    "sites , short - range links , and long - range links . the site @xmath21 and @xmath1",
    "are attached to a particle source and sink , respectively . ]",
    "consider a graph @xmath22 consisting of @xmath1 sites which are labeled as @xmath23 .",
    "every pair @xmath24 with @xmath25 is connected with a short - range link to form a 1d backbone .",
    "in addition , we select @xmath0 pairs of sites at random and add long - range links between them  ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . the shortcut density , the total number of long - range links divided by @xmath1 , is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "every link has an orientation : a link between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is directed from @xmath26 to @xmath27 if @xmath28 and vice versa .",
    "such a direction will be referred to as a forward direction .",
    "it is assumed that the boundary site @xmath21 , called an entrance , is attached to a particle source where particles are fed into the system at constant rate .",
    "the other boundary site @xmath29 , called an exit , is attached to a particle sink which absorbs particles at a constant rate .",
    "we consider the asep process on such a graph .",
    "more precisely the particle dynamics is defined as follows : a particle enters the system at a rate denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "particles which have entered the system are then allowed to hop along forward links at rate one . if a particle is located at a site which is connected to others via multiple forward links one of these is randomly chosen . for each forward link",
    "the selection probability is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the number of forward links at a given site @xmath26 .",
    "a particle can leave the system at site @xmath1 ( the exit ) at a rate denoted as @xmath4 . throughout the process , particles are subject to the exclusion principle which forbids multiple occupancy . therefore any trial move violating the exclusion principle",
    "is rejected .",
    "one can represent the structure of a graph @xmath22 with an adjacency matrix @xmath32 whose elements @xmath33 take the value of @xmath34 only if there is a forward link from site @xmath27 to @xmath26 . due to the link directionality , @xmath35 for all @xmath28 .",
    "then , the hopping probability of a particle from site @xmath26 to @xmath27 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the number of forward links out of site @xmath26 .",
    "it should be noticed that the hopping probability is a quenched random variable .",
    "it varies from one realization of a graph to another .",
    "consequently , the quenched average over different realizations of the graph is necessary .    here , we are interested in the particle density distribution and the current .",
    "let @xmath38 be the occupation number at site @xmath26 .",
    "it is a stochastic variable evolving according to the asep dynamics . for a given realization of the graph ,",
    "its average value is governed by the time evolution equation @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 here the angle bracket @xmath42 represents the average of a quantity @xmath43 for different realizations of the stochastic noise .",
    "in contrast to the 1d - asep particle conservation in the bulk does not imply that the current is the same for every link .",
    "therefore , the current can be defined in several ways .",
    "an obvious choice is to count the number of particles entering or leaving the system since the particle reservoirs are each connected via a single link .",
    "the incoming current @xmath44 through the entrance and the outgoing current @xmath45 from the exit are given by @xmath46 in the bulk site @xmath26  ( @xmath47 ) , the current @xmath48 is defined as the total current of particles departing from sites @xmath49 and arriving at sites @xmath50 .",
    "it is given by @xmath51 with this definition of the current , the time evolution of the density is given by @xmath52 for @xmath40 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , all values of the local currents @xmath48 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 should be the same in the steady state , where @xmath55 .",
    "the time - evolution equations ( [ dni_dt ] ) , ( [ dn1_dt ] ) , and ( [ dnl_dt ] ) already illustrate the difficulty in calculating the quantities of interest . in order to determine the particle density two - point correlations have to be calculated , which in turn require higher order correlation functions .",
    "furthermore , the quenched average over the random variables @xmath56 is necessary .",
    "an exact solution of this process is not available .",
    "so , we will investigate the model using a numerical simulation method in the following section .",
    "in this section we present numerical results obtained from monte carlo simulations . for a simulation ,",
    "one generates a graph @xmath22 with an adjacency matrix @xmath57 consisting of a 1d chain of @xmath1 sites and @xmath0 shortcuts .",
    "particles on @xmath22 move in the following way : first , we select a random variable @xmath58 with equal probability .",
    "( i ) if @xmath59 , we add a particle to the entrance site @xmath21 with probability @xmath3 if it is empty .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath60 , we try to move a particle ( if any ) at site @xmath16 to a target site @xmath27 selected among @xmath61 with probability @xmath62 given in ( [ p_hop ] ) .",
    "the particle move can be carried out if the target site is empty .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath63 , we remove a particle ( if any ) at the exit site @xmath29 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the time is incremented by unity after @xmath64 trials .",
    "we are interested in the particle distribution and the current in the steady state . after a transient period of time interval @xmath65 , we average the occupation number for the time interval @xmath66 to obtain the steady - state occupation number distribution @xmath67 .",
    "note that the mean occupation number varies from one realization of a graph to another . in a second step a quenched average @xmath68_{\\mathcal{g}}$ ] over graph realizations",
    "is necessary .",

    "the system size is @xmath74 and the shortcut density @xmath75 . ]",
    "the overall behavior of the particle density @xmath8 and the current @xmath72 is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "those data were averaged over @xmath76 graph realizations over a time interval @xmath77 after a transient interval @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] suggests that there exist three different regimes .",
    "when @xmath3 is small , the overall density @xmath8 is close to zero . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath8 is close to 1 when @xmath4 is small .",
    "a finite - size - scaling  ( fss ) analysis reveals that the system indeed undergoes nonequilibrium phase transitions between three different phases , which will be discussed below .     at fixed @xmath79 .",

    "the scaling function has a limiting behavior @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "the fss indicates that system undergoes a continuous phase transition at a critical point @xmath89 . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the density of vacant sites is zero .",
    "that is to say , the system is fully occupied by particles .",
    "such a macroscopic state will be called a _",
    "jammed phase_. near the critical point with @xmath91 , the density of empty sites scales as @xmath92    figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the plot of @xmath8 along a line @xmath80 .",
    "the data are well fitted to a fss form  @xcite @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the scaling function has a limiting behavior @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "hence we conclude that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at a critical point @xmath99 .",
    "the particle density vanishes for @xmath100 .",
    "such a macroscopic state will be called an _",
    "empty phase_. near the critical point with @xmath101 , the particle density scales as @xmath102    .",
    "the location of symbols  ( @xmath103 between the e and s phases , and @xmath104 between the s and j phases ) is determined from the fss analysis .",
    "the solid lines are the phase boundary obtained from the mean - field and annealed approximation developed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . ]    repeating the fss analysis , we obtain the numerical phase diagram as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the phase diagram consists of the empty  ( e ) phase with @xmath105 and the jammed  ( j ) phase with @xmath106 .",
    "the other phase with @xmath107 will be called a shock  ( s ) phase .",
    "although the phase diagram looks similar to that of the asep on 1d chains  @xcite , the nature of the phases is different .",
    "the particle distribution is intriguing in the s phase . taking @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,",
    "we have measured the particle density distribution @xmath110 in the steady state at a given realization of @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows typical distributions . there is a phase separation between a region with @xmath111 and a region with @xmath112 . the domain boundary between the two regions",
    "is called a shock .",
    "the localized shock gives a hint why there are phase transitions into the e and j phases .",
    "the system can be in the e  ( j ) phase when the shock is absorbed at the exit  ( entrance ) .",
    "hence it is crucial to understand the mechanism for the shock formation .",
    "this will be discussed in the following section .    .",
    "parameter values are @xmath113 , @xmath75 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . ]    before proceeding , we present a physical argument for the phase diagram .",
    "it is known that the diameter @xmath114 of the small - world network with nonzero shortcut density @xmath2 scales as @xmath115  @xcite .",
    "this means that any site can be reached from a given site within @xmath114 steps  @xcite .",
    "then , a particle injected at the entrance can move toward the exit with a diverging speed @xmath116 along the backbone in the @xmath117 limit when @xmath3 is so small that the exclusion is irrelevant near the entrance .",
    "consequently , particles can escape instantly from the system and the e phase can be realized .",
    "using the same argument we can understand the origin of the j phase .",
    "a hopping of a particle from one site to another is equivalent to a hopping of a hole in the opposite direction .",
    "hence , when @xmath4 is small enough , a hole injected at the exit can travel toward the entrance with the diverging speed in @xmath118 steps and the j phase can be realized .",
    "the s phase is a result of competition between the empty domain  ( which is stabilized by the long - range hopping of particles ) and the jammed domain  ( which is stabilized by the long - range hopping of holes ) .",
    "this argument clearly shows that the small - world property is crucial in the formation of the e , j , and s phases .",
    "the small - world property emerges at any nonzero value of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hence we expect that those phases replace the ld , hd , and mc phases of the conventional asep in 1d chains immediately as one turns on the long - range links .",
    "we have also performed the numerical simulations with @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in both cases",
    "we observe qualitatively the same phase diagram . as @xmath2 increases , the e phase expands while the j phase shrinks .",
    "for example , when @xmath80 , we found that @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 at @xmath119 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath126 , we found that @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 at @xmath119 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , respectively . we do not find a simple explanation for the observed @xmath2 dependence of the phase boundary",
    "we adopt a mean field approximation by assuming that @xmath130 for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 . applying the mean field approximation to ( [ dni_dt ] ) , ( [ dn1_dt ] ) , and ( [ dnl_dt ] ) yields that @xmath131 where the auxiliary quantities are defined as @xmath132 and @xmath133 with the kronecker @xmath134 symbol . the quantities",
    "@xmath135 and @xmath136 can be interpreted as particle evaporation and deposition rates at site @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "they depend on the structure of an underlying graph through @xmath56 and the whole particle density distribution @xmath137 .",
    "this interpretation of the rates @xmath135 and @xmath136 allows to relate our model to the 1d asep with constant evaporation and deposition rates which was studied in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that model the rates @xmath135 and @xmath136 in our model depend on the particle distribution as well as on the realization of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the steady - state density satisfying @xmath138 is given by @xmath139 since @xmath135 and @xmath136 depends on the particle distribution , ( [ sce ] ) should be solved self - consistently .",
    "the self - consistent equation can be solved numerically via iteration .",
    "starting from any trial distribution , one updates it by evaluating the right - hand side of ( [ sce ] ) .",
    "a particle distribution converges to a steady - state distribution without difficulty .    in order to test the mean field approximation",
    ", we compare the particle density profile obtained from the monte carlo method and the mean field approximation . for a given graph @xmath22",
    ", we have performed the monte carlo simulation and solved the self - consistent equation for the steady - state density profile .",
    "they are compared in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the mean field approximation reproduces the phase separation and the shock in the density profile . in many cases ,",
    "a mean field result is remarkably close to a monte carlo result  ( see the top and middle panels in figure  [ fig5 ] ) . on the other hand , in some cases",
    ", there is a noticeable quantitative discrepancy between them  ( see the bottom panel in figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the mean field result still indicates the presence of the shock clearly .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the mean field theory is suitable for the description of the phase transitions .",
    "the density profile given by the solution of ( [ sce ] ) depends on a graph realization @xmath22 .",
    "we have to perform the quenched average over graph realizations to obtain the disorder - averaged density profile @xmath140_{\\mathcal{g}}$ ] .",
    "the quenched average is analytically intractable .",
    "hence we further make an approximation by replacing an adjacency matrix element @xmath33 , which is a quenched random variable , with its disorder - averaged value @xmath141_{\\mathcal{g}}$ ] .",
    "such an approximation is called an annealed approximation .",
    "the annealed approximation is useful in studying physical systems on graphs or networks  @xcite .    on a graph of @xmath1 sites , there are @xmath0 long - range links . hence the probability to find a long - range links between two sites @xmath26 and @xmath142",
    "is given by @xmath143 .",
    "short - range links are connecting sites @xmath26 and @xmath144 for @xmath25 . taking account of the short- and long - range links",

    "the parameter @xmath148 is replaced by @xmath149_{\\mathcal g } / [ k_j]_{\\mathcal g}$ ] with @xmath150_{\\mathcal g } = ( 1 + 2p(l - j-1)/l)$ ] .    in the annealed approximation ,",
    "the self - consistent equation for the disorder - averaged density @xmath151 becomes @xmath152 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are given by @xmath153 with the boundary terms @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "equations  ( [ rho_i ] ) , ( [ r_i_av ] ) , and ( [ q_i_av ] ) are the starting point for further analysis .",
    "we first consider the sites with @xmath156 near the entrance .",
    "ignoring @xmath157 corrections , one can approximate @xmath135 and @xmath136 as @xmath158 with the boundary term @xmath159 and the overall particle density @xmath8 .",
    "these expressions allow for an interpretation for an effective dynamics near the entrance : a particle at site @xmath26 performs a short - range jump to site @xmath144 with probability @xmath160 or annihilates spontaneously with the probability @xmath161    due to the effective annihilation , the particle density should decay to zero exponentially with the distance from the entrance along the backbone with a characteristic length scale @xmath162 unless @xmath106 .",
    "this feature is consistent with the density profile shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",

    "these expressions suggest that particles near the exit have a following effective dynamics : a particle at site @xmath26 performs a short - range hopping to site @xmath144 with the probability @xmath167 and particles are created spontaneously at each site with the probability given by the second term in ( [ q_out ] ) . due to the creation",
    ", the particle density should saturate to unity as one departs from the exit along the backbone .",
    "the density profiles stemming from the both boundaries converge to different values of 0 and 1 .",
    "so , there must emerge a shock as a domain boundary .",
    "the position of the shock along the backbone is denoted by @xmath168 , which is related to the overall particle density as @xmath169 making use of the shock structure , the quantity @xmath170 in ( [ q_out ] ) is given by @xmath171 with @xmath157 corrections being ignored .",
    "correspondingly , the particle creation probability near the exit is given by @xmath172    so far we have established the shock state .",
    "effectively , particles near the entrance hop to the right with the probability @xmath173 or are annihilated with the probability @xmath174 . this dynamics results in a density profile @xmath175 which decays to zero as @xmath26 increases . near the exit ,",
    "particles are created effectively with the probability @xmath176 and hop to the right with the probability @xmath177 .",
    "this results in a density profile @xmath178 which converges to unity as @xmath26 decreases from @xmath1 .",
    "both profiles should be matched at a position @xmath179 to yield a shock .",
    "this situation is similar to the driven 1d asep with particle creation and annihilation  @xcite or boundary driven multi - lane systems  ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when the creation and annihilation rates are spatially uniform and inversely proportional to the lattice size , the system also develops a shock in the stead - state density profile  @xcite . in comparison with the model studied in  @xcite ,",
    "the creation and annihilation rates are not uniform in space : particles are annihilated near the entrance and created near the exit .",
    "the difference results in the feature that the shock separates the empty and the fully jammed domains .    the parameters @xmath174 and @xmath180 depend on the the overall particle density @xmath181 , which should be determined self - consistently .",
    "the overall density can be obtained from the current conservation , which will be explained in the following subsection .",
    "particles are injected at the entrance ( @xmath21 ) , move to the right , and are removed at the exit  ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "so , the system can carry a nonzero current .",
    "the incoming current at the entrance and outgoing current at the exit are given by @xmath182 because @xmath183 and @xmath184 are governed by the @xmath8-dependent effective dynamics , the incoming and the outgoing currents are given as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "particle number conservation requires that the incoming and outgoing currents should be the same in the steady state .",
    "the equality @xmath185 determines the overall particle density @xmath8 , hence the phase diagram .",
    "the effective dynamics is still too complex and does not allow for the closed - form solution for @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , the exact phase diagram will be obtained from numerical solutions of the self - consistent equations and the current - balance condition . before doing so",
    ", we apply an approximate scheme to the self - consistent equations in order to gain a physical insight .    in terms of the effective dynamics ,",
    "all particles introduced at the entrance have to be transferred toward the exit and therefore annihilated from the entry area .",
    "so , the incoming current can also be written as @xmath187 using the explicit forms given in ( [ r_in ] ) and ( [ q_in ] ) , the self - consistent equation for the density becomes as @xmath188 for @xmath189 .",
    "because of the continuous annihilation of particles , we expect that @xmath190 decays monotonically and rather fast to zero . in order to gain a qualitative understanding we can ignore @xmath191 in the denominator to obtain that @xmath192 inserting these approximate solutions into ( [ jin_sum ] ) , one obtains that @xmath193",
    "comparing the two expressions for @xmath44 given in ( [ jin ] ) and ( [ jin_trial ] ) , one finds a solution for @xmath194 , which yields that @xmath195 it is a decreasing function of @xmath8 with @xmath196 and @xmath197",
    ".    one can carry out a similar analysis to obtain an approximate expression for @xmath198 .",
    "first , the outgoing current given in ( [ jout ] ) should be equal to the total particle creation rate , that is to say , @xmath199 it is easy to show that the void density @xmath200 satisfies self - consistent equations @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "again the transport of particles via long ranged links can be understood as spontaneous creation of particles at sites close to the exit .",
    "therefore , we expect that @xmath200 decays to zero as @xmath26 decreases from @xmath1 .",
    "so we can ignore @xmath203 in the denominator as in the previous case .",
    "a similar calculation then yields @xmath204 this is an increasing function of @xmath8 with @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath45  ( dashed lines ) against @xmath8 . ]",
    "the particle number conservation requires that the incoming current and the outgoing current should be the same in the steady state .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows schematic plots of @xmath207 and @xmath208 in three different situations . in the first case",
    ", the current curves may intersect with each other at @xmath209 with @xmath210 as shown in figure  [ fig6](a ) .",
    "this case corresponds to the shock phase .",
    "the intersection determines the shock position @xmath211 .",
    "if @xmath8 becomes greater  ( smaller ) than @xmath212 due a stochastic fluctuation , then the incoming current becomes smaller  ( greater ) than the outgoing current .",
    "consequently , the particle density is attracted toward the steady - state value and the shock is driven toward the steady - state position .",
    "this explains the reason why there is a localized sharp shock  @xcite .",
    "the second case with @xmath213 for all values of @xmath8 is shown in figure  [ fig6](b ) .",
    "then , the shock is localized at the entrance and the steady - state density is equal to one . in this case",
    "the system belongs to the jammed phase .",
    "the third case is sketched in figure  [ fig6](c ) .",
    "if @xmath214 for all values of @xmath8 , the shock is localized at the exit and the steady - state density is equal to zero .",
    "then the system belongs to the empty phase .",
    "we have solved numerically exactly the self - consistent equations for @xmath215 and @xmath216 to obtain the incoming and outgoing currents as a function of @xmath8 at each set of values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the current balance condition allows us to evaluate the steady - state particle density and the current , hence the phase diagram . the resulting numerical phase diagram in the @xmath73 plane",
    "is presented in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the phase diagram at @xmath75 consists of the empty phase , jammed phase , and the shock phase , which is consistent with the monte carlo result .",
    "there is a quantitative discrepancy in the location of the phase boundaries , which is caused by the approximations .",
    "the annealed approximation requires the self - averaging property  @xcite .",
    "the self - averaging property in the small - world network was tested for the equilibrium ising model  @xcite . to test the self - averaging property in our nonequilibrium model ,",
    "we have measured the relative sample - to - sample fluctuation of the particle density @xmath217_{\\mathcal g }   - [ \\langle \\frac{1}{l } \\sum_i n_i \\rangle]_{\\mathcal g}^2 \\right ) } /   [ \\langle \\frac{1}{l } \\sum_i n_i \\rangle]_{\\mathcal g}$ ] . in the e and j phases , it decays to zero as @xmath218 suggesting a strong self - averaging  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it converges to a finite value in the s phase , an indication of non - self - averaging .",
    "this tells us that the annealed approximation has a limitation .",
    "it explains successfully the mechanism of shock formation , but not its average position due to the strong fluctuations .",
    "a refined approach beyond the annealed approximation is necessary to study the sample - to - sample fluctuation phenomena in the s phase .",
    "we have studied the boundary - driven asep in the 1d chain with long - range links .",
    "this setup represents a generic situation for directed transport in a complex network , e.g. , the exchange of data between two sites of a computer network .    the backbone of nearest neighbor links ensures the existence of a path between start and destination .",
    "the long ranged links add shortcuts to the transport network that are in principle able to enhance the capacity of the system .    considering the typical results for",
    "transport problems on complex networks one would also expect that long - range shortcuts , added randomly on to a lattice , are believed to suppress fluctuations and make a system homogeneous .",
    "this is , however , not the case when there is a boundary driving .",
    "compared to the pure one - dimensional system it turns out that the long - range links play an essential role .",
    "they generate a localized shock which separates the 1d chain backbone into an empty and jammed regions .    adopting the mean field and the annealed approximations ,",
    "we have derived effective dynamics near the entrance and the exit , which are similar to those of the asep with spontaneous particle annihilation and creation , respectively .",
    "the effective theory reveals the mechanism for the shock formation and for the phase transition .",
    "the phase diagram consists of the empty , shock , and jammed phases .",
    "the shock phase is characterized by presence of a localized shock and separating a low and a high density domain .",
    "the shock position and the overall particle density @xmath8 vary continuously with the model - parameters . in the empty  ( jammed ) phase ,",
    "the shock is anchored to the exit  ( entrance ) to yield @xmath20 .    in conclusion ,",
    "our study shows that a driven system on a spatially disordered structure displays an inhomogeneous pattern .",
    "the appearance of a localized shock is reminiscent of one - dimensional systems without particle - conservation in the bulk .",
    "in contrast to these systems the mechanism driving the localization of the shock is neither the competition between bulk and boundary reservoirs nor an optimal partitioning between multiple lanes . here ,",
    "the long - ranged links enhance the mass transfer between entry and exit and thereby stabilize the position of the shock .    considering more generally the transport capacity of a complex network between arbitrary sites our results have important consequences .",
    "they indicate that , as far as the capacity of the feeding particle reservoir does not exceed the capacity of the exit reservoir , the sites of the backbone are only rarely occupied and can be used in parallel for transport issues between other sites .",
    "contrary , overfeeding the backbone leads to a complete blockage of the sites in question which may spread over the whole network .",
