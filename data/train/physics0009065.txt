    "the intensive investigations of the cr@xmath1-doped laser media testify about their high potential in the tunable generation in mid - ir between 2  5 @xmath2 m .",
    "a special interest is connected with cr@xmath1 : znse  active medium due to its excellent material properties : high thermal conductivity which is close to that one of yag , the absence of excited state absorption , and very broad gain band which allows for tunable generation in 2  3 @xmath2 m range .",
    "the latter is very attractive for a lot of applications : remote sensing , spectroscopy , ophthalmology , and neurosurgery .    at this moment , the pulsed@xmath3 and continuous - wave operation@xmath4 in cr@xmath5 : znse lasers was demonstrated with ingaas and tm : yalo laser pumping , which demonstrated high efficiency and favorable lasing abilities of this active crystal .    a very interesting property of cr@xmath1 : znse is the high coefficient of the nonlinear refraction@xmath6 that results from the relatively small bandgap , i. e. , in fact , from the semiconductor nature of the material .",
    "as it is known , the higher nonlinear refraction is favorable to self - starting of kerr - lens mode locking@xmath7 .",
    "the decrease of kerr - lens mode locking threshold allows to simplify the laser configuration , to improve the ultrashort pulse stability , and to increase the lasing efficiency .",
    "another advantage of cr@xmath1 : znse as media for ultrashort pulse laser is a very broad gain band , which can support the generation of 12 fs pulses .",
    "however , high nonlinear refraction coefficient is the source of some shortcomings .",
    "as it was shown@xmath8 , the kerr - lens mode - locked lasers demonstrate a variety of unstable regimes that can destroy the ultrashort pulse and prevent from the pulse shortening .    here , for first time to our knowledge",
    "we analyze the kerr - lens mode locking abilities of cr@xmath1 : znse laser .",
    "the analysis of znse nonlinear properties is presented that is necessary for an optimization of the laser design and for investigation of self - starting ability and ultrashort pulse stability in cr@xmath1 : znse laser .",
    "as it is known@xmath6 , the two - photon absorption , raman scattering and stark effect strongly contribute to nonlinear refractivity in semiconductors .",
    "the main parameter , which defines a value of nonlinear refraction coefficient @xmath9 , is the bandgap energy @xmath10 :    @xmath11=\\frac{k\\sqrt{e_{p}}g_{2}(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega } { e_{g}})}{% n_{0}e_{g}^{4}}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath12 is the linear coefficient of refraction ; @xmath13 for the most of direct gap semiconductors ; @xmath14 is a material - independent constant ; @xmath15 is the function depending only on the ratio of photon energy and the energy gap of the material . for znse @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath15 we used the following approximation in the below bandgap region :    @xmath17which was obtained from experimental data presented in ref@xmath7 .",
    "in addition to dependence of @xmath15 on wavelength , we have to take into account the dispersion of @xmath12 . for znse",
    "the next approximation is valid :    @xmath18(here @xmath19 is in meters ) . a resulting dependence of @xmath20 on wavelength is shown in fig .",
    "1 . there is a strong kerr nonlinearity producing self - focusing effect .",
    "the value of @xmath20 exceeds the typical values of the most of dielectric crystals by two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , this is not sufficient for the estimation of the nonlinear properties of znse . despite the fact that znse has cubical lattice , there is not center of inversion in crystal . as result , the medium possesses the second - order nonlinear properties . the corresponding nonlinear coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "although there is no efficient frequency conversion , the existence of second - order nonlinearity can strongly contributes to the nonlinear refractivity due to so - called cascaded second - order nonlinearity , which can be used for kerr - lens mode locking@xmath22 .",
    "usually , change of the index of refractivity has non - kerr character , but the kerr - like approximation @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the field intensity ) is valid if@xmath25 @xmath26 , where    @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the fundamental frequency and wave number , correspondingly ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the linear refractive index and wave number for the second harmonic .",
    "our calculations showed , that the kerr approximation for znse is valid up to intensities of @xmath33 at 2 @xmath2 m and @xmath34 at 3 @xmath2 m , and it is used throughout present work .",
    "the nonlinear coefficient of refraction due to cascading second - order nonlinearity is@xmath25 :    @xmath35    note , that in the case of the normal dispersion of @xmath12 the nonlinearity due to second - order nonlinearity has a defocusing nature .",
    "the dependence of @xmath9 on the wavelength is shown in fig .",
    "one can see , that the nonlinear refraction is very strong . as result of the joint contribution of third- and second - order nonlinearities ,",
    "a net - coefficient of nonlinear refraction is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the nonlinearity is focusing up to 1.2 @xmath2 m and defocusing in mid - ir range .",
    "an experimental value of @xmath20 measured at 1.06 @xmath2 m demonstrates an excellent agreement with the corresponding value of calculated curve in fig .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath20 enables us to estimate a mode locking efficiency due to kerr - lensing .",
    "we have used the method presented in @xmath36 : for each fixed value of the focal length of the mirror @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) we varied a folding distance and the position of active medium trying to maximize the value of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the effective transmission of the hard aperture .",
    "this parameter defines the inverse saturation intensity of the efficient fast saturable absorber , induced by joint action of kerr self - focusing in active medium and difractional losses at aperture . for the common kerr - lens mode - locked lasers @xmath40 . in the case of znse",
    "the modulation parameter is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen , that the kerr - lensing efficiency in this case is higher by two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is interestingly , that the defocusing nature of the nonlinearity does not affect the process of the cavity optimization essentially : the change of the sign of @xmath20 only slightly affects the position of active medium and folding distance .",
    "the optimized cavity configuration is shown in fig .",
    "calculated values of @xmath38 suggest a good kerr - lens mode locking ability of cr@xmath1 : znse  laser . however , the strong self - phase modulation while being the positive factor facilitating self - focusing , can , on the other hand , destabilize an ultrashort pulse generation due to automodulational instability@xmath8 . in order to estimate the mode locking stability in cr@xmath1 : znse  laser we performed the numerical simulation on the basis of fluctuation model and distributed scheme of the laser generation .",
    "the master equation was :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the field , @xmath43 is the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath44 is the saturated by full field energy gain coefficient , @xmath45 is the inverse bandwidth of the spectral filter , @xmath46 is the net - group delay dispersion , @xmath47 is the self - phase modulation parameter , @xmath48 is the active medium length , @xmath49 is the diffraction loss , defined from configuration of laser , @xmath50 = @xmath51 .    the strong self - phase modulation and self - focusing dominate over the gain saturation .",
    "the last factor provides the negative feedback in laser that stabilizes ultrashort pulse .",
    "the critical parameter defining the ultrashort pulse dynamics is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the gain saturation fluency .",
    "the decrease of this parameter worsens the pulse stability . to comparison , in znse @xmath54",
    "is ten times lower than in ti : sapphire .",
    "therefore , to obtain the stable pulse generation , we have to increase @xmath54 e.g. by increasing @xmath45 .",
    "the stable pulses were obtained for @xmath55 .",
    "the pulse duration was about 300 fs for 800 mw absorbed pump power .",
    "an additional stabilization factor is the minimization ( down to zero ) of net - dispersion .",
    "the character of the pulse destabilization needs some comments .",
    "the typical scenarios are shown in figs .",
    "the pulse behaviors presented here were calculated for the same set of the laser parameters but for different initial noise samples .",
    "there are the possibilities for multipulse generation ( fig .",
    "6 ) , generation of the breezer - like pulse and its subsequent disintegration ( fig .",
    "7 ) , and the collapse of the pulse into several pulses ( fig . 8) .",
    "note , that breezer - like pulse is formed without action of the soliton mechanism in laser because of net - dispersion in this case is close to @xmath56 .",
    "the regime depicted in fig .",
    "8 is characterized by low - frequency modulation of the generation spectrum that at last leads to the pulse collapse .",
    "it should be noted , that the generation of the stable single pulse is depended on the random noise sample , too .",
    "the analysis of the nonlinear properties of znse ",
    "crystal was performed .",
    "it was found , that the strong second - order cascading nonlinearity in the combination with third - order phase nonlinearity causes a strong focusing kerr nonlinearity in near - ir and defocusing quasi - kerr nonlinearity in mid - ir ranges . as result ,",
    "the efficiency of the kerr - lensing in active medium is two - three orders of magnitude higher than in typical active media of femtosecond lasers",
    ". the optimal cavity configuration for kerr - lens mode locking was found .",
    "but , as the analysis testifies , the main problem of the ultrashort pulse generation in cr@xmath1 : znse  laser is the pulse destabilization due to strong self - phase modulation .",
    "this requires to decrease the bandwidth of spectral filter .",
    "the last allows to generate 300 fs pulses .",
    "the self - start of kerr - lens mode locking has a statistical character , that is depended on the noise sample .",
    "the investigation of the pulse destabilization testifies about formation of the breezer - like pulses and pulse collapse due to low frequency perturbations .",
