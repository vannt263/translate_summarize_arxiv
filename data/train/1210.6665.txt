    "in many optoelectronic devices , synthetic macromolecules , and biological processes , electronic excitation energy is transported from one location to another .",
    "electronic energy transfer is thus an important process in physics , chemistry , biology , and engineering .",
    "a considerable body of recent work has focused on electronic energy transfer in photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the initial steps of photosynthesis involve energy transfer over a range of distances and timescales : energy is transferred among the chromophores inside individual antenna complexes ; from one antenna complex to another ; and from the antenna complexes to the reaction center , where the excitation energy is used to separate charges and eventually split water .",
    "two regimes for energy transfer in photosynthesis have been well understood since about the 1950s based on the balance between inter - chromophore electronic coupling ( @xmath1 ) and the coupling of any individual chromophore to its bath ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "frster theory can be used when the coupling to the bath dominates , @xmath3 , and redfield theory can be used when the coupling between chromophores dominates , @xmath4 .",
    "but in the intermediate - coupling regime where @xmath5 , energy - transfer processes are neither well understood nor straightforward to treat mathematically . some theoretical progress has been made in the past two decades @xcite .",
    "energy - transfer theories are important , and they need to be verified by experiments . because the events are fast  usually nanosecond timescales or faster  it is natural for measurements to use femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "most typical are pump - probe spectroscopy measurements @xcite , but technical advances @xcite have made two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy ( 2d es ) measurements of photosynthetic proteins @xcite frequent as well .",
    "one of the most interesting observations from 2d es measurements of photosynthetic proteins are distinct cross peaks with oscillating amplitudes @xcite .",
    "cross peaks can be signatures of coupling ( in several forms ) or energy transfer @xcite .",
    "cross peaks with oscillating amplitudes are most often signatures of intramolecular vibrational modes ( vibrational coherence ) or strong electronic coupling ( electronic coherence ) @xcite .",
    "similar coherent oscillations have been observed in photosynthetic proteins using related techniques as well @xcite .",
    "the measured coherences have evoked questions about energy transfer in the intermediate - coupling regime in biological systems and even larger questions about the nature of photosynthetic complexes @xcite .",
    "femtosecond spectroscopy is a powerful tool that will continue to be the primary source of new insight into the mechanisms governing energy transfer in photosynthesis .",
    "yet a nagging question persists regarding the disconnect between the coherent excitation via femtosecond pulses used in experiments and the almost fully incoherent excitation via sunlight that photosynthetic organisms experience in natural conditions : can incoherent excitation produce the same coherences observed in femtosecond spectroscopy measurements ?",
    "a few theoretical studies relate to this question @xcite , but no experiment has been performed or even suggested . fortunately there is an established , joint theoretical and experimental framework that can address the question .",
    "this is the lesser - known technique called _ noisy - light spectroscopy _ which was developed concurrently with ( one - dimensional ) ultrafast laser spectroscopy . in 1984 ,",
    "morita and yajima @xcite , asaka et al , @xcite , and beach and hartmann @xcite independently demonstrated that noisy light could be used to achieve femtosecond - scale time resolution in degenerate four - wave mixing experiments . during the subsequent decade a variety of noisy - light analogues to more traditional ultrafast experiments",
    "were developed @xcite .",
    "although noisy light offers some advantages , it is not as generally useful as its short - pulse counterpart .",
    "one exception is coherent anti - stokes raman scattering spectroscopy ( i@xmath6cars ) , where the noisy - light version has proven to be a very useful tool that is still being used to investigate a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "noisy sources have found occasional uses and advantages in other spectral regimes as well @xcite .",
    "the main feature and utility of noisy - light spectroscopy is that the time resolution is given by the coherence time of the light , not the temporal envelope . in principle",
    ", the noisy beam may be continuous wave ( cw ) , although in practice it is often pulsed on the ordered of nanoseconds ( still essentially cw relative to femtosecond and picosecond material dynamics ) . in a typical experiment such as i@xmath6cars , the noisy - light beam enters a michelson interferometer to generate identical twin beams .",
    "one of the beams is delayed in time relative to the other by a controllable spatial delay in one arm of the interferometer .",
    "this can be generalized to multiple identical noisy beams with several controllable delays for more complicated techniques .",
    "both short pulses and noisy light are spectrally broad , and in principle they could have identical optical spectral densities . but the differences between the excitation sources give rise to fundamentally different physical processes . for femtosecond pulses",
    "the frequency components must be _ phase locked _ ( not to be confused with phase matched ) .",
    "that is , all frequency components must have a specific phase relationship so that the interference generates a stable femtosecond laser pulse @xcite .",
    "short pulses are ideally suited for direct time measurements ; however , there are at least two disadvantages . first , femtosecond - pulse experimental setups are expensive and the experiments have strict stability requirements .",
    "in contrast , noisy - light experiments have more relaxed stability requirements and require fewer expensive pieces of equipment .",
    "there are several reasons for this , but the most important is that noisy light is unaffected by dispersion @xcite , unlike short pulses where extensive efforts are often required @xcite .",
    "second , finely resolved spectral information must be determined through analysis of the time information .",
    "the phase - locking requirement prevents direct probing of the sample spectrally , although gross spectral probing is possible since experimentally accessible femtosecond pulses do not have infinitely broad spectra . on the other hand",
    ", the spectrum of noisy light is completely _",
    "phase unlocked_. that is , the phase of any one frequency component is completely independent of any other frequency component . in a sense",
    "each frequency component is behaving as if it came from an independent cw source .",
    "in other words , the noisy light source is built from an incoherent superposition of monochromatic cw light ; this random superposition produces a spatially coherent laser beam whose electric field is a stochastic function of time .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider how noisy light would interact with a photosynthetic pigment - protein complex . because of its phase - incoherent nature",
    ", noisy light is an important step closer to sunlight than are femtosecond pulses . in this work",
    "we use the well - established technique of factorized time correlation ( ftc ) diagram analysis @xcite  along with direct calculation of the spectroscopic signals  to describe a noisy - light version of two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy ( i@xmath0 2d es , where i@xmath0 indicates four incoherent beams ) . the theory is presented and discussed for noisy light interacting with a bloch four - level system .",

    "this assumption  which has been used successfully in noisy - light spectroscopy for almost three decades  allows the four - point time correlator to be expressed in terms of two - point time correlators , @xmath72 this approximation makes the mathematics more tractable and still captures the essential features of noisy - light spectroscopy .",
    "zhang and coworkers have considered noisy - light fields with a variety of statistical characteristics and have considered the four - point correlator directly for special cases @xcite .",

    "the development of noisy - light spectroscopy has been hindered by the added mathematical complexity imposed by the quasi - cw and stochastic features of the light .",
    "the quasi - cw nature of the noisy light forces one to consider all possible time orderings of the field - matter interactions in the perturbative treatment of the nonlinear signal @xcite .",
    "the stochastic nature of the light requires explicit use of the bichromophoric model @xcite to handle the nontrivial averaging at the intensity level .",
    "the total field is the phase - matched sum of the signal fields launched from each of the individual chromophores in the sample . in the homodyne detection scheme ,",
    "the mod - square of this sum is dominated by the cross terms , meaning those fields launched from two distinct chromophores .",
    "the total intensity is then very well represented by the sum of all pairwise , meaning two - chromophore , contributions .",
    "this bichromophoric model leads to the familiar @xmath73 dependence of the signal intensity in the coherent nonlinear spectroscopies , where @xmath74 is the number density of chromophores in the sample . for short - pulse spectroscopies ,",
    "this point is not of practical relevance .",
    "the third - order polarization alone is sufficient for describing the nonlinear signal .",
    "going to the intensity level is trivial ",
    "it is just the mod - square of the calculated polarization . for noisy - light spectroscopies",
    ", however , stochastic averaging of the noise at the intensity level requires that special attention be given to the signal intensity .",
    "the correlations among the various noisy - light field interactions on the two ( otherwise independent ) chromophores must be explicitly treated .",
    "these correlations are fundamental to the understanding of noisy - light spectroscopies .",
    "explicit use of the bichromophoric model requires assigning distinct timelines ( @xmath28 and @xmath75 ) to each of the two generic chromophores .",
    "the two timelines allow for the ( in general ) different histories of evolution for each chromophore .",
    "subsequent stochastic averaging links the @xmath28 and @xmath75 time variables in a nontrivial way .",
    "the heterodyne detection scheme considered for this work replaces the second chromophore field in the bichromophoric model with the local - oscillator field . in principle",
    "one would not need explicit use of the bichromophoric model but doing so is desirable because it mirrors the homodyne scheme and , as will be shown below , is beneficial for subsequent analysis .",
    "as it turns out , one can apply a diagrammatic representation of the mathematical expressions describing any given noisy - light signal @xcite .",
    "these diagrams are called factorized time correlation ( ftc ) diagrams , and the complete set of these diagrams represents the breakdown of the noisy - light signal into its elementary physical components .",
    "the set of ftc diagrams for the i@xmath0 2d es measurement considered here are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftcs ] . in general , the set of ftc diagrams is isomorphic with the set of intensity - level terms for a given noisy - light spectroscopy . because the topological operations performed on the ftc diagrams",
    "represent mathematical operations performed on the analytic intensity - level terms , conceptual tools have been developed to connect the topological operations with the mathematical operations .",
    "the conceptual tools also allow one to glean considerable physical insight from the ftc diagrams @xcite .",
    "three of the conceptual tools  accumulation , synchronization , and color locking  will be particularly important for ftc diagram analysis of the i@xmath0 2d es signal .",
    "although extensive discussions have been previously presented @xcite , these three concepts will be briefly reviewed here because of their utility in the remainder of this work .      across the ensemble of chromophores",
    ", the noisy fields may act on a given ensemble member at any time during the pulse duration .",
    "for those sequences of field actions that produce the noisy - light signal considered in this work , the ability of the fields to act at any time on a given chromophore must be summed over the ensemble of chromophores contributing to the production of the nonlinear signal . from a topological point of view",
    "this is represented on an ftc diagram as the freedom of a tick mark to ` slide along a timeline ' .",
    "since the noisy beams are ` always ' present , any time intervention ( represented by a tick mark on the ftc diagram ) , or correlated pair of interventions , is free to slide along the timeline provided the specific time ordering associated with a given ftc diagram is maintained .",
    "that is , during the sliding along the timeline , tick marks can not cross one another .",
    "to ` slide along the timeline ' indicates the potential for the field action to take place at any time over which the tick mark is permitted to slide .",
    "however , an individual tick mark is locked to a partner tick mark by the segment representing a pair correlator .",
    "the two tick marks , thus linked , correspond to a correlated event pair that must slide along the timeline together .",
    "this ability to ` slide along the timeline ' is called _ accumulation_. physically , accumulation represents the summation over the ensemble of chromophores in which the correlated noisy field interventions have the ability to act at any time relative to the other correlated pairs of actions that produce the signal .",
    "mathematically , it represents integration over the time intervals between the light - matter interactions .",
    "the second conceptual tool is concerned with the event coupling between the two timelines ( @xmath28 and @xmath75 ) .",
    "this coupling involves inter - timeline pair correlators .",
    "this implies tight _ synchronization _ between the two chromophores of the events linked by a given correlator line .",
    "the ` precision ' or ` strength ' of this synchronization is inversely proportional to the coherence time of the noisy light . for simplicity",
    "the correlation functions are taken to be @xmath76-functions , thus synchronization is perfectly precise  the coherence time of the noisy light is taken to be zero .",
    "for this work synchronization occurs between the @xmath28 timeline where the polarization on the chromophore is being developed and the @xmath75 timeline representing the local oscillator field .      noisy light has a broad spectrum similar to that of femtosecond pulses , with the important distinction that it is completely _ phase unlocked_. one says the noisy light is _ color locked _ , because each color ( or , equivalently , each frequency ) is coherent only with itself ",
    "it is uncorrelated with any other color .",
    "color locking is a consequence of the wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite which is expressed mathematically most conveniently by examining a pair correlator in frequency space : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the optical spectral density of the noisy light . in the context of noisy - light spectroscopy",
    ", this implies that regardless of the spectral density of the sources , only identical frequencies may correlate to one another in a pairwise fashion .",
    "the consequence of color locking on ftc diagram analysis is extremely important : _ whichever frequency component happens to act from one field of a correlated pair ( represented by one end of a line or arrow ) , the other field of the correlated pair ( represented by the other end of the line or arrow ) must act with the same frequency component_. this allows one to maintain the use of correlator terminology for a single color and refer to a @xmath48-@xmath48 color - locked pair correlator , where @xmath48 is a single frequency component of the noisy light .      to date",
    ", ftc diagram analysis has been applied to several noisy - light spectroscopies @xcite and also explored in a more general context @xcite to elucidate the underlying mathematical structure of the diagrams . in all previous work",

    "the @xmath75 timeline represents that of the local oscillator . in the heterodyne scheme",
    "the distinction between the two timelines is trivial but nonetheless formally important .",
    "there is a single tick mark placed at the right terminal side of the horizontal line representing the local oscillator action at the detector during the quadrature event which brings the signal to the intensity level .",
    "this means @xmath80 .    in femtosecond",
    "2d es , the local - oscillator delay is not related to the signal - generation process other than as a _ temporal reference _ that is removed via spectral interferometry in post - processing of the data @xcite .",
    "importantly , for simulations of femtosecond 2d es , the local oscillator can be ignored altogether except mentioned that it allows one to recover the phase and amplitude of the emitted signal . in i@xmath0 2d es , the action of the local oscillator is slightly different .",
    "the local oscillator serves as a _ temporal anchor _",
    "( setting @xmath80 ) because of synchronization ( described above and in refs @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting , but somewhat of an aside , that for homodyning in noisy - light experiments , the detection event is not part of the @xmath50-point field correlator .",

    "<S> recent work has shown that electronic coupling between chromophores can lead to coherent oscillations in two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements of pigment - protein complexes measured with femtosecond laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> a persistent issue in the field is to reconcile the results of measurements performed using femtosecond laser pulses with physiological illumination conditions . </S>",
    "<S> noisy - light spectroscopy can begin to address this question . in this work we present the theoretical analysis of incoherent two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy , i@xmath0 2d es . </S>",
    "<S> simulations reveal diagonal peaks , cross peaks , and coherent oscillations similar to those observed in femtosecond two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the results also expose fundamental differences between the femtosecond - pulse and noisy - light techniques ; the differences lead to new challenges and new opportunities . </S>"
