    "a picture is emerging in recent years according to which binary interaction plays a major role in the evolution of very massive stars .",
    "the main processes involved are mass transfer and merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the best example is @xmath0 carinae , one of the most massive binary systems in our galaxy , composed of a primary luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , and a somewhat evolved massive o - star secondary .",
    "the estimated masses are @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the orbital period is five and a half years @xcite , and the orbit is highly eccentric , @xmath3 . for several weeks",
    "every periastron passage the binary system experiences a strong interaction , possibly with some mass transfer . along the rest of the orbit",
    "the winds from the two stars collide with each other .",
    "the colliding winds determine many of the emission and absorption properties of .",
    "the x - ray emission , for example , comes directly from the post - shock regions of the two winds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the binary interaction was much stronger during the two eruptions in the nineteenth century , when the primary is thought to have been in an unstable state .",
    "huge amounts of mass were lost during the 1837.9  1858 great eruption ( ge ; see @xcite for a review on the ge and some other observed properties of ) .",
    "the bipolar homunculus nebula surrounding the system and containing most the ejected mass is the most prominent structural feature from the ge ( @xcite ) .",
    "some non - negligible fraction of the mass lost by the primary star was accreted by the secondary star during these twenty years @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate was higher near periastron passages , accounting for observed luminosity peaks during the ge .",
    "both the ge and the weaker 1887.3  1895.3 lesser eruption ( le ) that followed it are the source of most of the circumbinary medium ( cbm ) .",
    "the le was a much less energetic eruption ( @xcite ) and only @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 were ejected from the primary ( @xcite ) .",
    "material ejected during the le is thought to be the source of the dense inhomogeneous blobs and the gas in their surroundings closer to the binary system ( @xcite ) .",
    "these blobs are known as the weigelt blobs ( wbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the wbs are concentrated on the nw side of @xmath0 car that is closer to us , but there is also dense material in other directions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction of the primary wind with the wbs environment ( wbe ) is the subject of our study .",
    "from hst / stis spectra of fe  ii , [ fe  iii ] , [ ni  ii ] and [ ni  iii ] lines from wbs c and d , @xcite found the radial velocity of the wbs to be @xmath6 , and concluded that the wbs were originated in the le . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented hst observations of wbs c and d together with simulations of their propagation and concluded that they formed during the period 1910  1942 , preferably during a brightening event which took place in 1941 .",
    "for the purpose of this paper it is immaterial when the dense wbe was ejected , but the uncertainty should be kept in mind .",
    "the most controversial property of the binary system is the direction of the semi - major axis in the equatorial plane , the so called longitude angle @xmath7 ( the argument of periapsis ) .",
    "it is defined such that @xmath8 for the case where the secondary is closest to us at apastron passages , and it is furthest away from us during periastron passages . for @xmath9",
    "the secondary is furthest from us at apastron passages , while it is closest to us at periastron passages .",
    "there is no dispute on the orbital plane location .",
    "the disputing camps have a literally opposite view , with one camp arguing for @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the other camp arguing for @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the quest for the longitude angle is not a small technical curiosity .",
    "its value is connected to the type of interaction between the winds of the two stars and between the winds and the cbm .",
    "for example , if the secondary is towards us near periastron passages , @xmath11 , then the several - weeks decline in the x - ray emission occurring around periastron passages must be accounted for by accretion of the primary wind by the secondary star @xcite .",
    "this is because the dense primary wind can not account for much x - ray obscuration .",
    "this in turn , implies that accretion was much more vigorous during the ge , with implications to the energy source of the ge .",
    "namely , a value of @xmath11 supports the claim for accretion as the extra energy source of the ge @xcite , hinting to an accretion event as the energy source for other transient outbursts @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the interaction of the primary wind with a simple model of the wbe . in section [ sec : velocity ]",
    "we describe the flow structure and previous works .",
    "the numerical setup is described in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "the interaction of the primary wind with the wbe model is described in section [ sec : interaction ] , and a comparison between our simulation results and observations is conducted in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "our short summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the recent dispute over the value of the longitude angle is centered around the interpretation of the velocity structure at hundreds of au from the binary system .",
    "@xcite presented observations of velocity structures of broad ( @xmath12 ) [ fe  ii ] emission line which extend to @xmath13 from the binary system , and [ fe  iii ] , [ ar  iii ] , [ ne  iii ] and [ s  iii ] lines which extend up to a projected distance of only @xmath14 from ne to sw .",
    "@xcite observed all those forbidden lines disappearing during the spectroscopic event  the several weeks period near periastron passages when large variations in emission and absorption properties occur .",
    "@xcite took hst / stis spectra of [ fe  iii ] emission lines from slits in different position angles through the central source of . while the low velocity component of these lines was associated with the wbs , @xcite interpreted the high velocity components of these lines as being formed by winds collision gas as it flows away from the binary system .",
    "@xcite presented more hst / stis high - ionization forbidden - line observations taken after the 2009 spectroscopic event , this time in the form of complete intensity maps .",
    "based on comparison with sph simulations and under the assumption ( which we dispute in the present paper ) that the lines originate by the colliding - winds material as it flows outward , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , concluded that the high velocity components of the forbidden - line observations fit an orientation in which the secondary star is in the direction of the observer for most of the binary orbit .",
    "namely , the longitude angle ( the argument of periapsis ) is @xmath10 according to their interpretation .",
    "@xcite also presented hst / stis spectra of high ionization lines ( [ fe  iii ] and [ n  iii ] ) around @xmath0 car extending over more than a full cycle .",
    "they also found that most of the emission arrives from the wbs region .",
    "moreover , they found a variation of the intensity of the lines over the entire orbital cycle , in addition to the fast increase before periastron that was followed by the typical decrease of the spectroscopic event .",
    "@xcite identified a fast blue - shifted component of the high ionization lines that appears concentrated near the stars and elongated perpendicular to the bipolar axis of the system .",
    "@xcite suggested that this component is related to the equatorial outflow and/or to dense material known to exist along our line of sight to the system .",
    "@xcite performed 3d numerical simulations of the colliding stellar winds , but completely ignored the slow dense ejecta in the equatorial plane  the wbe .",
    "the high resolution observations reported recently by @xcite and @xcite that extend to @xmath15 from the binary system overlap with the wbe as mapped by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reexamined the observations and interpretation of @xcite and @xcite , and concluded that the interaction with the wbe can not be ignored when modeling emission from that region .",
    "hence , @xcite claimed , the conclusion of @xcite that @xmath11 can not account for the velocity map does not hold .",
    "instead , @xcite suggested that the contribution of the winds collision gas to the observed velocity structure at hundreds of au is small .",
    "the main contribution to the asymmetric flow structure is of the freely expanding primary wind as it collides with the wbe . because the wbe is closer to us , and for most of the time the secondary is away from us for @xmath11 , the secondary wind does not intercept the primary wind flowing towards the wbe .",
    "observations by @xcite present evidence of latitude - dependent velocity of the @xmath0 car primary wind .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , attribute this observed dependence of the primary wind velocity on the latitude to its collision with the secondary wind . in our model ,",
    "the winds collision occurs on the other side of the binary system , and has no effect on the wbe region .",
    "hence , in our simulations we choose a simple radial wind , independent of the latitude .    in the scenario proposed by @xcite",
    "the primary stellar wind collides with the slow dense material in the wbe and goes through a shock wave .",
    "the post - shocked gas reaches a temperature of @xmath16 but rapidly cools to @xmath17 and is compressed .",
    "this warm dense gas is expected to become a source of some emission lines , including forbidden lines .",
    "@xcite further showed that the intensity and location of the different velocity components of the [ fe  iii ]  @xmath184659 extended forbidden line can be explained by the interaction of the primary wind with the wbe .",
    "@xcite made a schematic drawing of the flow structure but did not conduct any numerical simulations of the flow .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wbe ] we present the observed inner region taken from figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the region surrounding the dense wbs , the wbe , around hundreds of au on the nw direction ( upper right in the image ) is quite complicated .",
    "the exact structure is not known as we see material in projection .",
    "it is assumed that the dense gas is near the equatorial plane that is inclined to line of sight by @xmath19 .",

    "the inset corresponds to the square marked around the center of the image.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the present paper we limit ourselves to show that the general velocity structure can be explained by the interaction of the primary wind with the wbe , as we can not reproduce accurately the exact density near the equatorial plane .",
    "it will be clear that by rebuilding the wbe in the numerical code we can reproduce the flow structure .",
    "a big uncertainty is the structure of the dense gas and its velocity when it was formed a century ago .",
    "another uncertainty in reproducing the image is the emissivity at each point due to the lack of knowledge of the ionizing radiation flux from the secondary .",
    "indeed , the velocity maps change over the orbital period .    considering the above , we take very simple wbe structures , either one or two spherical dense blobs ( clouds ) .",

    "we define the numerical @xmath23 axis to lie along the line of sight .",
    "the numerical @xmath24 and @xmath25 axes are defined so that the center of the primary star , that is the source of the wind , the observer and the centers of the clouds that form the wbe in our model are all in the @xmath26 plane ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the wbe model is symmetric about the @xmath28 plane .",
    "the @xmath25 axis and the vector from the primary star to the center of the large wbe cloud define a plane that corresponds to the equatorial plane of the binary system .",
    "the grid size is @xmath29 in the @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 directions , with 128 equal - size cubical cells along each axis ( single cell size is @xmath30 ) .",
    "the wind of the @xmath0 car primary star is modelled by a radial outflow from the central region of the grid ( the inner 100 au ) , with a mass loss rate of @xmath31 and velocity of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the wbe has been ejected by the system more than a century ago .",
    "however , some dense equatorial outflow might have been continued for tens of years .",
    "it is impossible to know the exact mass loss history and mass loss rate that led to the formation of the wbe . considering that our goals are ( a ) to show that the interaction of the primary wind with the wbe can not be neglected , and ( b ) to show that this interaction can in principle give the velocity maps at hundreds of au from the system , we consider two very simple models . in those models",
    "the wbe is composed either from one or two spherical clouds that start with zero velocity .",
    "a more realistic value would be to start the wbe with some radial outflow velocity of @xmath6 .",
    "however , if we choose to model the outflow velocity with a non - zero value , we would need to change the initial conditions of the simulation so that the center of the wbe is closer to the center of the binary system , and then let the system evolve over 50 years . as there are still many uncertainties regarding the past evolution of both the wbe and the primary stellar wind , such a simulation would require additional parameters related to the evolution of the wbe and the primary stellar wind to be added to our model .",
    "such delicate modelling of the past evolution is not in the focus of the present paper , and we choose a simplified model of the system taking the radial outflow velocity to be zero .",
    "another uncertainty is the history of the primary wind , that could have been weaker until recently , or could have been stronger in the equatorial plane until recently .",
    "it is hard to know .",
    "we simply base our two models on the present existence of the wbe and its location . considering these",
    ", we run our simulations for @xmath33 , until the wind launched from the center of the grid fills the entire grid .",

    "we perform 3d gas flow simulations of the interaction of the @xmath0 car primary wind with the dense gas clouds ( wbe ) in the equatorial plane of the binary system . considering the complex and vaguely resolved structure of the wbe ( see figure [ fig : wbe ] ) , we choose two simple models for the wbe : ( 1 ) the wbe is modelled by a single spherical cloud ;",
    "( 2 ) the wbe is modelled by two spherical clouds , one large and one small ( see figure [ fig : initial ] for more details ) . for comparison with [ fe  iii ]",
    "observations @xcite we construct synthetic emission maps at different velocity intervals ( see figure [ fig : gull ] ) .",
    "the exact reconstruction of the synthetic maps is made difficult by the high uncertainties in the ionization degree of iron in the wbe , and in the varying amount of ionizing radiation produced by the secondary star .",
    "taking these into account we use a simple prescription to calculate the emission .",
    "we assume that the emission is produced only by warm gas with temperatures of @xmath69 , and take the emission intensity to be proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "this set of simplifying assumptions allows only qualitative comparisons .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : gull ] , we can qualitatively explain the velocity maps in the red , zero , and blue - shifted velocity intervals .",
    "the observed zero - velocity component is explained by the presence of slow dense warm material that constitutes the shocked wind and the wbe .",
    "we also compare the results of our simulations with the hst / stis spatially resolved [ fe  iii ] spectra of @xmath0 car , as given by @xcite . while we are able to reproduce some of the large scale features in the observed line profiles , the overall agreement between the observed and the synthetic line profiles is somewhat limited . to obtain better agreement the wbe structure",
    "must be better resolved , and the ionization degree of iron and the ionizing radiation must be calculated .",
    "these are complicated tasks that are much beyond the present study .    based on the results of our simulations",
    "we conclude that the observed emission maps and line profiles can be explained as a result from the interaction between the primary star wind and the wbe , as previously suggested by @xcite .",
    "as the wbe is closer to the observer than the center of the binary system is , it follows from our results that the primary star ( which blows the freely expanding wind ) is also closer to the observer than the secondary star for the majority of the binary period , e.g. the longitude angle of the binary system is @xmath87 .",
    "our results add to a growing number of observations in favour of this longitude angle , and dispute the claim made by @xcite and @xcite that the observed velocity maps and line profiles exclude a value of @xmath11 .",
    "our result shows that this orientation can account for the observations , and that the collision of the primary wind with the wbe can not be ignored .",
    "we admit though that the winds collision should also be considered . including both winds collision and the wbe interaction is very demanding numerically , and should be the goal of future studies .",
    "knowledge of the exact orientation of the @xmath0 car binary system is of importance for correct interpretation of observations in the upcoming 2014 spectroscopic event .",
    "knowing the correct value of @xmath7 will allow us to better understand the interaction of the binary system near periastron passages , and aid in further study of the accretion processes that took place during the great and lesser eruptions , deepening our understanding of interacting lbv binary systems .",
