    "<S> in this paper the dynamical spin effects of the light - front holographic wavefunctions for light pseudoscalar mesons are studied using two different assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> these improved wavefunctions are then confronted with a number of sensitive hadronic observables : the decay constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , their @xmath2-moments , the pion - to - photon transition form factor , and the pure annihilation @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath5 , @xmath6 and their ratio @xmath7 as constraint conditions , the @xmath8 analyses for holographic parameters , including the mass scale parameter @xmath9 and effective quark masses , are all consistent with the mass scale which controls the slopes of the light - quark hadronic regge trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also show how the improved light - front holographic distribution amplitudes regulate the end - point divergences which appear in the annihilation amplitudes of @xmath10 decays .    * </S>",
