    "the cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) @xcite provides a new architecture for 5 g cellular systems . in c - rans , the baseband processing of base stations is carried out in the cloud , i.e. , a centralized base band unit ( bbu ) , which launches joint signal processing with coordinated multi - point transmission ( comp ) and makes it possible to mitigate inter - cell interference .",
    "the separation of the bbu and the radio units ( rus ) brings a new segment , i.e. , fronthaul links , to connect both parts .",
    "the limited capacities of fronthaul links have a significant influence on the system performance of c - rans .",
    "there are several existing works on fronthaul links in c - rans .",
    "efficient signal quantization / compression for fronthaul links is designed to maximize the network throughput for the uplink and downlink in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in @xcite , fronthaul quantization and",
    "transmit power control are optimized jointly . in @xcite",
    ", energy - efficient comp is designed for downlink transmission considering fronthaul capacity . in @xcite ,",
    "the capacities of fronthaul links are allocated under a sum capacity constraint to maximize the total throughput . in @xcite ,",
    "the fronthaul links are reconfigured to apply appropriate transmission strategies in different parts according to both heterogeneous user profiles and dynamic traffic load patterns .",
    "however , these existing works have all focused on the physical layer performance without consideration of bursty data arrivals at the transmitters or of the delay requirement of the information flows . since real - life applications ( such as video streaming , web browsing or voip ) are delay - sensitive , it is important to optimize the delay performance of c - rans .",
    "to take the queueing delay into consideration , the fronthaul allocation policy should be a function of both the channel state information ( csi ) and the queue state information ( qsi ) .",
    "this is because the csi reveals the instantaneous transmission opportunities at the physical layer and the qsi reveals the urgency of the data flows .",
    "however , the associated optimization problem is very challenging . a systematic approach to",
    "the delay - aware optimization problem is through a markov decision process ( mdp ) . in general , the optimal control policy can be obtained by solving the well - known _",
    "bellman equation_. conventional solutions to the bellman equation , such as brute - force value iteration or policy iteration @xcite , have huge complexity ( i.e. , the curse of dimensionality ) , because solving the bellman equation involves solving an exponentially large system of non - linear equations .    in this paper , we focus on minimizing the average delay by fronthaul allocation .",
    "there are two technical challenges associated with the fronthaul allocation optimization problem :    * * challenges due to the average delay consideration * : unlike other works which optimize the physical layer throughput , the optimization involving average delay performance is fundamentally challenging .",

    "the associated bellman equation is to obtain the priority function , and there is no easy and systematic solution in general @xcite . *",
    "* challenges due to the coupled queue dynamics : * the queues of data flows are coupled together due to the mutual interference .",
    "the associated stochastic optimization problem is a @xmath0-dimensional mdp , where @xmath0 is the number of data flows .",
    "this @xmath0-dimensional mdp leads to the curse of dimensionality with complexity exponential to @xmath0 for solving the associated bellman equation .",
    "it is highly nontrivial to obtain a low complexity solution for dynamic fronthaul allocation in c - rans .    in this paper , we model the fronthaul allocation problem as an infinite horizon average cost mdp and propose a low - complexity delay - aware fronthaul allocation algorithm . to overcome the aforementioned technical challenges",

    "technique , we obtain a closed - form approximate priority function and the associated error bound . based on that , we obtain a low - complexity delay - aware fronthaul allocation algorithm .",
