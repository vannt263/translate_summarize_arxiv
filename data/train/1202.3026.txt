    "our knowledge about the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath4 is still limited .",
    "although @xmath4 as the first radial excitation state of the @xmath0 has been predicted and studied for a long time , it is very recently that we gained more detailed information about its decay properties in experiment at cleo  @xcite and bes - iii  @xcite .",
    "the exclusive decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to a pair of light vector mesons are of great interests among many other properties of these two states .",
    "one reason is that the @xmath8 decay channel turns out to be one of the most important decay channels for both @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , the branching ratios for @xmath9 are typically at order of @xmath10 to @xmath11 . in contrast",
    ", these decay channels should be suppressed by the so - called helicity selection rule ( hsr )  @xcite .",
    "such an observation of the hsr violation indicates the importance of qcd higher twist contributions or presence of a non - pqcd mechanism that violates the hsr .",
    "the contradiction between the data and the hsr expectations based on the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) has drawn much attention , and various attempts have been made to understand the underlying dynamics  @xcite .",
    "another reason is that @xmath12 exclusive decays can also be closely related to the long - standing so - called",
    " @xmath7 puzzle \" in @xmath13 .",
    "the decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 into light hadrons are supposed to be via the valence @xmath3 annihilations into three gluons in pqcd to the leading order at a typical distance of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the following relation similar to that between @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be expected : @xmath15 in the heavy quark limit , i.e. @xmath16 is infinitely large , the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath4 can be neglected .",
    "hence , the branching ratio fraction becomes @xmath17 similar to the  12% rule \" between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays . in the above equation @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the values of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 wavefunctions at their origins , respectively . on the other hand , in terms of the leading contributions from a potential quark model",
    ", deviations can be expected and one has @xmath20 where the kinematic corrections can not be neglected .    in the case of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays , many theoretical efforts have been made in order to understand the origin of a significant deviation from the  12% rule \" in @xmath21 and @xmath22 in recent works  @xcite , we show that the interferences between the strong and em decay amplitudes in both @xmath13 are essential for understanding the  @xmath7 puzzle \" .",
    "similar ideas had been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a numerical study of the overall decay channels for @xmath13 indeed suggests such a phenomenon  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the intermediate charmed meson loops can be considered as a long - distance effect to suppress the strong transition amplitudes due to their destructive interference with the short - distance strong transition amplitude in the @xmath23 decays .",
    "as the spin-0 partner of @xmath24 , the decays of @xmath2 provide an alternative way to examine the role played by the intermediate meson loop ( iml ) effects in the explanation of the  @xmath7 puzzle \" . in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the lack of experimental data at that moment , the long - distance iml could not be well constrained , and it was assumed that the iml contributed about @xmath25 of the amplitudes in @xmath9 channel . with the recent availability of experimental data from bes - iii  @xcite , we can fit five channels of @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , to constrain both the short and long - distance contributions . the short - distance contribution in @xmath31",
    "can thus be extracted by the ratio of the wave functions at the origin between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", the evolution of the iml to @xmath4 gives the long - distance contribution in @xmath31 .",
    "note that the em contributions via fig .",
    "[ fig - power](b ) is negligibly small in comparison with the strong ones via fig .",
    "[ fig - power](d ) .",
    "it makes the decays of @xmath32 an ideal place to single out the roles played by the short and long - distance strong transitions .",
    "as follows , we will first provide the details of our formulations for the short and long - distance iml transitions in sec .",
    "the numerical results and analysis are presented in sec .",
    "iii , and a brief summary is given in the last section .     and",
    "@xmath33 . ]",
    "this section provides the details of our theoretical approach for @xmath32 .",
    "the first part is a parametrization of the short - distance contributions via hard gluon radiations in @xmath34 when the @xmath35 and @xmath36 annihilate at the wavefunction origin .",
    "the second part is the intermediated charmed meson loop transitions which account for the long - distance contributions .",
    "namely , it describes non - negligible light quark pair creations before the @xmath3 annihilation .",
    "these two mechanisms , in principle , have no double counting in the decays .",
    "an obvious advantage for the exclusive decays of @xmath34 is that these transitions , similar to @xmath38 , have only one unique lorentz structure for the @xmath39 couplings .",
    "as stressed a number of times before , this will allow a parametrization of the effective coupling constant contributed by different mechanisms . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a parametrization scheme is proposed for the short - distance transitions where the okubo - zweig - iizuka singly disconnected ( sozi ) and doubly disconnected ( dozi ) processes can be parameterized by the gluon counting rule .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the transition amplitudes for @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 potential , and parameter @xmath43 denotes the coupling strength of the sozi transitions .",
    "parameter @xmath44 is the ratio of the dozi transition over the sozi transition .",
    "it should be pointed out that the additional gluon exchanges in dozi are not necessarily perturbative . however , since they are higher twist contributions we expect that their contributions would be small .",
    "this effect can be parameterized by @xmath44 , of which a small value suggests a suppressed dozi contribution  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the su(3 ) flavor breaking parameter @xmath45 , of which its deviation from unity reflects the change of couplings due to the mass difference between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the amplitudes for other charge combinations of @xmath48 and @xmath29 are implicated .",
    "a commonly used form factor is adopted in the calculation of the partial decay widths : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the three momentum and relative angular momentum of the final - state mesons , respectively , in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "we adopt @xmath52 gev , which is the same as in refs .",
    "such a form factor will largely account for the size effects from the spatial wavefunctions of the initial and final state mesons .",
    "a well - developed effective lagrangian approach is applied to estimate the long - distance iml transition amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams for @xmath0 decays into @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 via the intermediate charmed meson loops are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - fey ] .",

    "in this work , we have studied the decay properties of @xmath0 and @xmath71 as an alternative process for the test of intermediate meson loop transitions .",
    "the availability of experimental data for @xmath9 allows the determination of our model parameters which then can be used as inputs in @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath13 is essentially important for isolating the short and long - distance transition amplitudes in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 decays .",
    "the predicted branching ratios for @xmath71 turn out to be consistent with the recent data from bes - iii  @xcite .",
    "this investigation provides additional information for the iml transitions .",
    "similar to @xmath72 , the iml effects are negligible in @xmath9 since their masses are far below the open charm thresholds .",
    "it was found that the iml transitions played an important role in @xmath73 since the mass of @xmath6 was close to the @xmath74 threshold  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the iml contributions in @xmath71 are not as significant as those in @xmath73 since the contributing open charm threshold starts with @xmath75 which is much higher than @xmath74 .",
    "this interesting feature suggests that the same iml mechanism would have rather different manifestations in different processes .",
    "we stress that such a correlated study is crucial for disentangling some of those long - standing puzzles in the charmonium energy region .",
    "we should also mention that our conclusions are based on the hypothesis that the flavor components of @xmath0 and @xmath4 are dominated by @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the connection of their spatial wavefunctions with those of @xmath5 and @xmath6 will make sense .",
    "if @xmath0 or @xmath4 possesses some other internal structures  @xcite , the relation between their branching ratios will be affected to some extent , which however , is not our focus in this work .",
