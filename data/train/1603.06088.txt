    "<S> many examples of this kind of sets can be constucted in a recursive way similar to that of the von koch snowflake .    to be more precise , we start with a bounded open set @xmath420 with finite perimeter @xmath421 , which is , roughly speaking , our basic `` building block '' .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath434 , i.e. @xmath435 . + </S>",
    "<S> therefore both the perimeter and the @xmath3-perimeter do not notice the fractal nature of the ( topological ) boundary of @xmath62 and indeed , since @xmath436 , we get @xmath437 for every @xmath4 . for example , in the case of the sierpinski triangle , @xmath56 is an equilateral triangle and @xmath69 , even if @xmath438 is a self - similar fractal .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath455 , @xmath456 and @xmath457 . </S>",
    "<S> then define a new building block @xmath458 and the set @xmath459 this new set has exactly the same structure of @xmath62 , since we are using the same collection @xmath460 of affine maps .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath461 and @xmath462 for every @xmath463 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath464 satisfies @xmath443 .    roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , what matters is that there exists a bounded open set @xmath56 s.t . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath465 this can be thought of as a compatibility criterion for the affine maps @xmath460 . </S>",

    "<S> actually , in general it will be a mix of unrectifiable pieces and smooth pieces . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we can not hope to get an analogue of corollary @xmath469 . </S>",
