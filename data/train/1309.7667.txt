    "stability of a metric against small space - time perturbations , usually termed as _ classical _ , _ gravitational _ or _ dynamical _ stability ( in order to distinguish from the thermodynamical stability , which has quantum origin ) , is a basic criteria of viability of a black hole model .",
    "while stability of four - dimensional black hole solutions has been very well ( but not exhaustively ) investigated , stability of higher - dimensional black holes has been less studied . in",
    "higher than four dimensions , absence of the traditional uniqueness theorem allows for a wide class of solutions with event horizons of various topologies @xcite .",
    "this makes the problem of stability even more appealing , because it allows one to discard inviable solutions .",
    "in addition , perturbation , quasinormal modes and stability of higher - dimensional asymptotically de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes and branes play an important role in the ds / cft @xcite and ads / cft correspondences @xcite .",
    "linear stability of higher - dimensional generalization of schwarzschild black holes ( given by the tangherlini solution ) was analytically proven for arbitrary @xmath2 by kodama and ishibashi @xcite . for a broad class of d - dimensional black holes allowing for the electric charge and lambda term the perturbation equations",
    "were reduced to the wavelike form @xcite . however , the analytical treatment of the stability problem looks intractable in @xmath9 if either the charge or lambda term is not zero .",
    "therefore , in a number of cases the stability problem was attacked numerically through the investigation of dominant resonance frequencies of the perturbation ( quasinormal modes ) in frequency domain , and through modeling of the evolution of perturbation in the time domain .    in this way ,",
    "i.e. , by numerical investigation of a black - hole quasinormal spectrum , stability of various of higher - dimensional black holes was analyzed . in @xcite and @xcite numerical evidence of linear stability of @xmath10-dimensional schwarzschild - ads ,",
    "reissner - nordstrm - ads and schwarzschild - de sitter black holes was found in the einstein - maxwell theory . in our earlier paper",
    "@xcite it was shown that @xmath8-dimensional nonextremal reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes are unstable when the electric charge and @xmath1-term are large enough .",
    "some other cases , including higher curvature corrections , dilaton , etc were considered in the literature ( reviewed in @xcite and @xcite ) . yet , as the above works used numerical treatment of the problem , each fixed value of @xmath2 was treated `` one by one '' leaving aside the general proof of ( in)stability for arbitrary @xmath2 .    here",
    "we shall study the ( in)stability of extremally charged reissner - nordstrm(-de sitter ) black holes numerically , and generalize the results to an arbitrary number of space - time dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "in @xcite the instability was demonstrated for @xmath7 highly charged but _ nonextremal _ black holes .",
    "here we shall find critical values of the cosmological constant @xmath1 which correspond to the threshold of instability of the _ extremally charged _ reissner - nordstrm - de sitter solution for @xmath7 .",
    "then , we shall extrapolate the data to higher @xmath2 and find a remarkably simple dependence of critical @xmath1 on @xmath2 , also indicating that the asymptotically flat extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes must be linearly stable for arbitrary @xmath2 . using the numerical data from @xcite for the nonextremally charged case here",
    "we shall show that the threshold values of black - hole parameters can be fitted by a simple analytical formula as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii gives basic formulae for the space - time metric , the master perturbation equations , and the time - domain integration method which we used .",
    "iii is devoted to the analysis of numerical data and its extrapolation to small values of the cosmological terms and large @xmath2 .",
    "iv describes the procedure of fitting of numerical data for the threshold parameters by an analytical formula .",
    "v , the conclusion , is a brief summary of results on stability of static higher - dimensional black holes in the einstein - maxwell theory studied by now .",
    "the metric of a @xmath2-dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de - sitter black hole has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12    the perturbation equation can be treated separately for scalars , vectors , and tensors and can be reduced to the wavelike form @xcite for each case , @xmath13 where _ the tortoise coordinate _",
    "@xmath14 is defined as @xmath15    we shall be interested here in the scalar type of gravitational perturbations , for which the effective potential has a negative gap , and , thereby , the instability is possible .",
    "this type of perturbations is referred to as the `` - '' type ( see ( 5.61 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the effective potential @xmath16 depends on the following parameters : the number of space - time dimensions @xmath2 , black hole mass @xmath17 , electric charge @xmath18 , lambda - term @xmath1 , multipole number @xmath19 .",
    "usually the instability occurs at the lowest multipole number @xmath20 . in our case",
    "higher multipoles are more stable . therefore , here we shall show numerical data only for @xmath20 perturbations of the `` - '' type .    we shall measure all the quantities in the units of the horizon radius ( @xmath21 ) . thus we define @xmath22    in order to parameterize the cosmological constant and the black - hole charge we introduce two dimensionless parameters , @xmath23 where @xmath4 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the cosmological and inner horizons .",
    "then , using the following equations , @xmath25 we can find @xmath1 and @xmath18 in terms of these parameters @xmath26 it is easy to see from ( [ paramaterization ] ) that , when @xmath1 or @xmath18 is zero , the corresponding dimensionless parameter , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , vanishes . by definition",
    ", @xmath29 corresponds to the extremal charge of a black hole . as @xmath30 the size of a black hole approaches to its extremal value in the de sitter universe .",
    "values of the parameters at the onset of instability we shall call _ critical _ or _ threshold _ values .    we shall study the evolution of the black hole perturbations of scalar `` - '' type ( @xmath20 ) in time domain using a numerical characteristic integration method @xcite , that uses the light - cone variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the characteristic initial value problem , initial data are specified on the two null surfaces @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the discretization scheme we used is @xmath35 where we have the following definitions for the points : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this method was tested for finding accurate values of the damped quasinormal modes ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently it has been also adopted for finding _ unstable _ , growing , quasinormal modes in @xcite for black strings and for gauss - bonnet black holes @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the time - domain and accurate frobenius methods ( as well as with the wkb method in the region of its validity @xcite ) is excellent . to test the reliability of the method",
    ", we increased the precision of the whole numerical procedure and decreased the grid of integration : unchanging of the obtained profiles of @xmath40 signifies that we have reached sufficient accuracy of computation .",
    "a thorough study of profiles of @xmath41 at sufficiently late time in the region of instability shows that the moment at which the growth of the signal starts depends on the value of @xmath27 . at a fixed spatial",
    "coordinate the smaller @xmath27 , the later is the moment at which growth of the profile begins ( fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) . with a personal computer and reasonable computation time",
    ", one can not find the asymptotic tails for time , which is much later than @xmath42 .",
    "thus , an extrapolation to large @xmath43 ( and small @xmath27 ) is necessary .",
    "fortunately , all the numerical values obtained here for the `` starting moments '' of instability ( let us designate them as @xmath44 ) obey the inverse cubic law very well : @xmath45 where the constant @xmath46 depends on @xmath2 and is positive for @xmath47 .",
    "thus , numerically found @xmath46 are _ threshold values of @xmath27 corresponding to the onset of instability for the extremally charged black hole_. then , it is natural to try to find these critical values of @xmath27 for any @xmath2 , and the extrapolation to higher @xmath2 also obeys a remarkably simple law ( see fig .",
    "[ 2 ] ) :    @xmath48    where the constant @xmath49 is close to unity . by fitting",
    "the numerical values of @xmath46 found for @xmath50 we obtain @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the critical value of the normalized cosmological constant @xmath27 corresponding to the onset of instability goes to zero as the number of space - time dimensions @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "that is , the _ extremally charged reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes unstable for all @xmath52 , while the pure reissner - nordstrm solution must be stable for arbitrary @xmath2_. the latter statement may look too strong and simply means that if there is an instability for the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution at some large @xmath2 , it has a different nature from the one we observed for reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes . if , contrary to our observation , the constant @xmath46 were negative at some @xmath2 , that would mean that one should expect an instability of the pure reissner - nordstrm solution ( @xmath53 ) at this value of @xmath2 .",
    "we computed time - domain profiles at a value of spatial coordinate @xmath54 fixed somewhere near the peak of the potential barrier .",
    "although the values of @xmath44 almost do not depend on the choice of @xmath54 , we considered profiles of @xmath41 at the same fixed @xmath54 for all values of @xmath27 on figs .",
    "[ 1 ] and  [ 2 ]",
    ". however , the choice of @xmath54 at the potential peak allows one to reduce the period of initial outburst to minimum .",
    "we take a constant as initial conditions on the null surface from the side of the black hole and a gaussian at the other null surface .",
    "we also computed time - domain profiles with another choice of initial conditions , namely , a constant at both null surfaces .",
    "although the profiles and , consequently , @xmath44 depend softly on the choice of initial conditions , we observe the same behavior of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath27 . by fitting these points",
    "we find the same critical values of @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the onset of instability does not depend on the choice of the initial conditions , and the point @xmath54 where the time - domain profile is considered .",
    "it is possible that some fine - tuning of the initial conditions could lead to unbounded growth of the signal just after the initial outburst for all @xmath55 .",
    "however , for the considered initial conditions the growing mode appears with a relatively small amplitude .",
    "that is why we observe growing at relatively late time , i.e. , when the stable ( damped ) modes are faded out .",
    "as @xmath27 approaches @xmath46 the growing rate of the unstable mode decreases and , therefore , it dominates at later time . that is why @xmath44 increases as @xmath56 .    the instability of extremal reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes found recently in @xcite is qualitatively different from the one we observe here .",
    "the instability discussed in @xcite propagates only along the event horizon and , therefore , at the linear order can not be observed by an external observer , so that for the observer the system still should look stable @xcite . the instability which we analyzed here propagates outside the event horizon and",
    "thereby may serve as criteria for viability of the black hole model or as an indication of bifurcation towards a new solution .",
    "a simple formula ( [ rho - c ] ) for critical values of @xmath27 motivated us to look at the nonextremal case as well and study critical values of @xmath28 for fixed @xmath27 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "taking data from our earlier paper @xcite , we have observed that for each @xmath55 the critical value of @xmath28 can be approximated by a simple function @xmath57 where constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend only on @xmath27 . according to numerical data , @xmath60 for each @xmath27 , so that for @xmath61 the right - hand side is always negative : i.e. , @xmath62 for @xmath61 .",
    "that is why we prefer the following equivalent exponential fitting : @xmath63 comparing @xmath58 and @xmath64 for various values of @xmath27 , we have observed a remarkable relation : @xmath65    by fitting the critical value of @xmath66 ( see fig .  [ 3 ] ) as @xmath67 we found the following coefficients :    [ cols=\">,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the current status of ( in)stability for static higher - dimensional black holes in the einstein - maxwell gravity is briefly summarized in table  [ tabl - i ] .",
    "in addition , we obtained the approximate analytical formula ( [ sigma - c ] ) relating parameters of a nonextremally charged black hole at the onset of instability ( see fig .",
    "[ 6 ] for comparison of the formula with the numerical data ) .    at the onset of instability",
    ", the dominant unstable mode has @xmath68 , which means that the perturbation approaches a constant at late times .",
    "the destiny of the unstable space - time can be learnt only within the fully nonlinear approach .",
    "the shape of a slightly perturbed black hole at the onset of instability was considered by us in @xcite .",
