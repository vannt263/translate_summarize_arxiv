    "water is an anomalous substance in many respects .",
    "its specific volume at ambient pressure starts to increase when cooled below @xmath0 .",
    "this density anomaly can be well explained by the tetrahedral structure of water . each molecule form hidrogen bonds with neighbors molecules by donating and receiving electrons from the hidrogens .",
    "but this is not the only peculiarity of water .",
    "while for most materials diffusivity decreases with increasing pressure , liquid water has an opposite behavior in a large region of the pressure - temperature phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this diffusivity ( or dynamic ) anomaly is due to the following mechanism : the increase in pressure disturbs the tetrahedral structure of water by the inclusion of an interstitial fifth molecule that shares an hydrogen bond with another neighbor oxigen . as a result , the bond is weakened and the molecule is free to move .",
    "the shared bond breaks and the molecule , by means of a small rotation , connects to another molecule enabling the translational diffusion @xcite .",
    "the structure and anomalies are therefore deeply related .",
    "the quantification of structure usually employs errington and debenedetti s translational order parameter @xcite @xmath1 that measures the tendency of pairs of molecules to adopt preferential separations , and steinhardt s @xcite orientational order parameter @xmath2 . for normal liquids , @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    "increase upon compression , because the system tends to be more structured . for systems with tetragonal symmetry",
    "@xcite the suitable orientational order parameter is @xmath4 that quantifies the extend to which a molecule and its four nearest neighbors assume a tetrahedral arrangement .",
    "it was found that in spc / e water both @xmath3 and @xmath5 decrease upon compression in a certain region of the pressure - temperature ( p - t ) phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this region is referred as the region of structural anomalies .",
    "is the tetrahedral structure the only one where anomalies would exist ?",
    "the answer to this questions is no .",
    "isotropic models are the simplest framework to understand the physics of liquid state anomalies . a number of such models , in which single component systems of particles interact via core - softened potentials @xcite have been proposed .",
    "they possess a repulsive core that exhibits a region of softening where the slope changes dramatically .",
    "this region can be a shoulder or a ramp .",
    "these isotropic models are design to represent interacions in water and other materials in an effective way .    recently , we investigated a system of particles interacting through a core - softened , ramp - like potential@xcite that has density , diffusion , and structural anomalies similar to that found for spc / e water . in this work",
    ", we use the same model to investigate the relation between the local structure of the fluid , as measured by the pair distibution function , and the density anomaly .",
    "the model we study consists of a system of @xmath6 particles of diameter @xmath7 , inside a cubic box whose volume is @xmath8 , resulting in a density number @xmath9 .",
    "the interacting effective potential between particles is given by    @xmath10 + a\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\left(\\frac{r - r_{0}}{\\sigma } \\right)^{2}\\right ] , \\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) is a lennard - jones potential of well depth @xmath12 and the second term is a gaussian centered on radius @xmath13 with height @xmath14 and width @xmath15 . with @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 , this potential has two length scales within a repulsive ramp followed by a very small attractive well , as we can see in figure [ cap : pot ] .    ) with parameters @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 in reduced units .",

    "( [ eq : potential ] ) was found density anomaly @xcite . in the neighborhood of the density anomaly region ,",
    "molecular dynamics simulations were carried out , in order to investigate density , diffusion , and structural anomalies . besides the confirmation of the presence of density anomaly we demonstrated that diffusion and structual anomalies are also present in our model @xcite .",

    "we found that the structural anomalous region have inside the diffusion anomaly region which in its turns englobes the density anomaly region .",

    "@xcite ) .    in order to understand the relation between structure and density anomaly , we analyse the pair distribution functions of our model ( fig . [ cap : allgrs ] ) .",
    "we see clearly three well defined regimes , namely :    \\(i ) for a low density , below the region where density anomaly occurs ( see fig . [",
    "cap : pt ] ) , the remarkable point is that the first peak ( close to the core ) of the @xmath29 are too modest , and the population of particles at this distance is negligible .",
    "note the arrows indicating the direction of temperature increase .",
    "\\(ii ) for intermediate density , inside the region of density anomaly , we have a considerable increasing of the first peak of the @xmath29 compared to the low density regime , specially at low temperatures .",
    "note that for temperatures @xmath30 and @xmath31 , just inside the density anomaly domain ( see the tmd line in fig .",
    "[ cap : pt ] ) the @xmath29 had experience a special accented growth compared to the higher temperatures . in the first peak the bottom @xmath29 corresponds to the lowest temperature and the top , to the highest temperature .",
    "the second peak of the @xmath29 , close to 2.5@xmath7 , has an opposite behaviour , and the arrow is downward .",
    "\\(iii ) for a high density , above the density anomaly region , the interesting thing to note is the inversion of the arrow in the first peak of @xmath29 .",
    "close to the core , the lowest temperature has the highest first peak .",
    "the trend in the second peak remains unchanged .",
    "this analysis suggests that the behaviour of the @xmath29 underlies the density anomaly effect in a close way .",
    "the anomaly develops when the inner peak , close to core distances , becomes increasingly important .",
    "we see that the first peak of the @xmath29 tends to increase faster for low temperatures upon compression than for the high temperatures .",
    "this suggests a connection between density anomaly and strucuture depending on the derivative of the @xmath32 with respect to the temperature at fixed density .",
    "a similar study of @xmath29 for several densities at constant temperature was also applied to show its pattern related to the structural anomaly region@xcite .    ) .",

    "the three isochores shown in this figure correspond to the regions below , inside , and above the region where density anomaly occurs , i.e. inside the tmd line ( solid line ) .",

    "using molecular dynamic simulations we have studied the density behavior , the diffusivity , and the structure of fluids interacting via a three - dimensional continuous core - softened potential with a continuous force .",
    "our model exhibits a region of density anomaly , inside which the density increases as the system is heated at constant pressure , and a region of diffusion anomaly , where the diffusivity increases with increasing density @xcite . in the pressure - temperature phase diagram , the density anomaly region lies inside the diffusion anomaly one .",
    "complementary to the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies , both @xmath3 and @xmath2 behave anomalously in a large region of the temperature@xmath40density plane .",
    "this continuous core - softened pair potential , despite not having long - ranged or directional interactions , exhibits thermodynamic , dynamic @xcite , and structural anomalies@xcite similar to the ones observed in spc / e water @xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of anisotropy in the interaction potential is not a requirement for the presence of thermodynamic , dynamic and structural anomalies .",
    "we also found that the pattern of isochoric change of the pair distribution fuction @xmath29 with temperature is closely related to the presence of density anomaly .",
    "the inset of this anomaly may be related to the derivative of population of molecules with respect to the temperature in a distance corresponding to the core distance ."
