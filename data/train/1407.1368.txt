    "double-@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) decay is a second - order weak process in which a nucleus decays to the neighboring nucleus by emitting two electrons and , usually , other light particles  @xcite , @xmath7 owing to the huge @xmath0 decay background , events of this process could , so far , only be recorded in some even - even nuclei , where the @xmath0 decay is energetically forbidden .",
    "there are several @xmath6 decay modes including the two - neutrino double-@xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) decay mode , @xmath9 and the neutrinoless ( @xmath1 ) decay mode , @xmath10    the @xmath8 mode is allowed in the standard model ( sm ) , while the existence of the @xmath1 decay would require to go beyond the sm .",
    "evidence for the @xmath1 decay would be a proof that neutrinos with definite masses are majorana particles and that neutrino masses have an origin beyond the sm  @xcite . this conclusion is independent of the underlying mechanism governing the weak process  @xcite .",
    "so far , half - lives of the @xmath8 decay have been measured in 11 isotopes , which are of the order of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath1 event has never been seen .",
    "only limits of the half - lives can be drawn from current experiments , which are @xmath12 .",
    "searches for the @xmath1 signals in the @xmath6 candidates are ongoing or proposed in a number of laboratories around the world ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "limits of the half - lives @xmath13 drawn from experiments provide stringent limits on the parameters associated with the assumed underlying mechanism . assuming a long - range interaction based on the exchange of a light majorana neutrino between two weak interaction vertices and restricting the currents to the standard @xmath14 form , the part that is proportional to the neutrino mass will be picked out from the neutrino propagator by the same helicity of the coupled leptonic currents  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case the associated parameter is the effective majorana neutrino mass .",
    "this is called the mass mechanism .",
    "being regarded as the minimal extension of the sm , the mass mechanism is the most popular assumption in current existing theoretical calculations .",
    "using the mass mechanism , one expects that the @xmath1 observation , combined with the results of neutrino oscillation experiments , will allow to obtain important information about the character of the neutrino mass spectrum , about the minimal neutrino mass @xmath15 and about the majorana charge - parity violating phase  @xcite . to extract the neutrino mass , the inverse half - life can be factorized as @xmath16^{-1}=g_{0\\nu } g_a^4(0)\\left|\\frac{\\langle m_\\nu\\rangle}{m_e}\\right|^2{\\left|m^{0\\nu}(0_i^+\\rightarrow 0_f^+)\\right|^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath17 and the electron mass @xmath18 are",
    "constants , and the kinematic phase - space factor @xmath19 can be determined precisely  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the accurate knowledge of the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) @xmath20 plays a crucial role for extracting the effective neutrino mass @xmath21 from the measurement of the decay rate .    the calculation of the nme requires two main ingredients .",
    "one is the decay operator , which reflects the mechanism governing the decay process .",
    "the other is the wave functions of the initial and final states .",
    "they are provided by theoretical nuclear models and carry the nuclear structural information .",
    "methods used in the literature to calculate the wave functions include the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa )  @xcite , the interacting shell model ( ism )  @xcite , the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite , the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb )  @xcite , and the nonrelativistic energy density functional ( nredf ) theories  @xcite .",
    "in the phfb , the beyond - mean - field correlation connected with the restoration of broken rotational symmetry is taken into account . in the nredf ,",
    "additional correlations connected with particle number projection , as well as fluctuations in quadrupole shapes  @xcite and pairing gaps  @xcite , are included .",
    "therefore , this method is also referred to as the multireference density functional theory .",
    "all these methods used so far are based on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the nonrelativistic reduced transition operators are therefore adopted in the calculations of the nmes for the neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay .    in the past decades ,",
    "covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) has been proven to be a very powerful tool in nuclear physics . on the mean - field level ,",
    "the single - reference cdft , or the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory , provides a good description of the static ground - state properties for finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic version of energy density functional ( redf ) takes into account lorentz invariance , which puts stringent restrictions on the number of parameters .",
    "the spin - orbit potential is included naturally and uniquely , as well as the time - odd components of the nuclear mean field . with the merits inherited",
    ", this method has also been generalized beyond the static mean - field level by the rpa  @xcite and qrpa  @xcite or by the multireference cdft ( mr - cdft ) method  @xcite , so that it could be applied for the description of the excited states , electromagnetic properties , and the weak transitions including the single- and double-@xmath0 decay .",
    "relativistic qrpa calculations based on the cdft have been carried out for the nmes of the @xmath8 decay  @xcite , where the transition operator has the same form as that used in the nonrelativistic studies .",
    "however , research in the @xmath1 mode has still to be done .",
    "the purpose of this work is to close this gap and to give a relativistic description for the nmes of the @xmath1 decay within the framework of mr - cdft .",
    "first , mr - cdft is able to give a unified description of all the @xmath1 candidates including heavy deformed nuclei .",
    "furthermore , reliable wave functions can be provided , with the restoration of symmetries by angular momentum projection ( amp ) and particle number projection ( pnp ) , as well as the inclusion of configuration mixing by the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "in addition , because the wave functions are dirac spinors , the transition operator derived from the feynman diagram of weak interaction , which is a @xmath22 matrix , can be directly sandwiched between the initial and final states without further reduction .",
    "therefore , this investigation also provides a way of testing the validity of the nonrelativistic reduction for the decay operator adopted in the nonrelativistic studies .    as the first attempt we investigate the @xmath1 decay of @xmath2nd , which is one of the most promising candidates for the @xmath1 decay experiments",
    "it has the second highest endpoint energy ( @xmath23 ) and the largest phase - space factor @xmath19 for the decay  @xcite .",
    "it does not seem feasible that this heavy deformed nucleus can be treated in the near future by a reliable shell - model calculation .",
    "however , research has been done with other methods so that comparisons can be made . in particular ,",
    "detailed discussion can be found for @xmath2nd and the daughter nucleus @xmath2sm in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the results for the spectra of low - lying excited states , the @xmath24 transition probabilities , the collective wave functions , and the nmes between them .",
    "we investigate the same nuclei to have a direct comparison of the results from two different state - of - the - art energy density functional ( edf ) methods , one of them nonrelativistic and another relativistic .",
    "previous research has shown that the nuclear deformation is responsible for the suppression of the transition matrix element for @xmath2nd .",
    "therefore , we pay particular attention to the effects of deformation and the corresponding shape fluctuations .",
    "moreover , @xmath2nd is one of the two isotopes where the transition to the first @xmath25 excited states of their daughter nuclei have been recorded in the @xmath8 decay experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore , from the experimental point of view , it is interesting to evaluate also the @xmath4 transition in addition to the ground - state to ground - state transition .",
    "there have been numerous discussions about the uncertainties in the calculated nmes related to the closure approximation , the inclusion of the high - order currents and the tensorial part induced by the high - order currents , the treatment of the finite nucleon size correction as well as the short - range correlation , and the use of different renormalized values for the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath17 , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite . because it is not our prior task in this paper to estimate these uncertainties , we just clarify here a few things about our calculations .",
    "( 1 ) the matrix elements are calculated in the closure approximation .",
    "( 2 ) the high - order currents are fully incorporated and the tensorial part is included automatically in the relativistic formalism .",
    "( 3 ) the finite nucleon size correction is taken care of by the momentum - transfer - dependent form factors .",
    "( 4 ) according to a recent study  @xcite , realistic values of short range correlation have only a small effect ( @xmath26 ) on the matrix elements ; thus , we omit the contribution of short - range correlation presently .",
    "( 5 ) investigations  @xcite show that the chiral two - body hadronic currents provide important contributions to the quenching of gamow - teller transitions . a momentum - transfer dependence for this quenching effect",
    "is predicted .",
    "therefore , it is more reasonable to include the contributions of two - body currents approximately ( on the one - body level ) by introducing an effective @xmath27 than introducing a renormalized constant @xmath28 . because the study on the effect of chiral two - body currents is far beyond the scope of this paper , the coupling constant is set to @xmath29 ( not to some renormalized values ) in the following discussion .",
