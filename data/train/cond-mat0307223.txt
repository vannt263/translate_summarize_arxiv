    "transport properties of two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des s ) subjected to a transverse magnetic field were extensively studied in late 60s and early 70s . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath203 in the range where the oscillations of microwave photoconductivity under consideration were observed experimentally is rather weak . the electron heating caused by the photon - assisted impurity scattering processes",
    "is compensated by the relaxation processes with the electron transitions from higher to lower ll s with the emission of acoustic phonons . as shown recently  @xcite , these relaxation processes contribute to the dissipative conductivity ( their contribution is negative ) complicating the spectral dependence of the microwave photoconductivity .",
    "a nontrivial dependences of the maxima / minima span on the microwave power are consistent with those observed experimentally  @xcite and are attributed to the multi - photon effects including the absorption and emission of real and virtual phonons ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a relatively large width of the microwave photoconductivity maxima and minima",
    "is often identified with an extra broadening of ll s ( in comparison with the ll broadening corresponding to the electron collision time determining the electron mobility ) associated with more complex interaction discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , this effect can be attributed to the nonlinear effects of the ac microwave field and strong electric - field dependences of the local photoconductivity characteristics combined with strong long - range fluctuations of the electric field . in the presence of strong long range ( @xmath154 ) electric - field fluctuations the macroscopic properties of the 2des ,",
    "in particular , the domain structures with the scale exceeding @xmath204 can be determined by the components of the dissipative photocurrent averaged over these fluctuations @xmath205 and @xmath206 . due to a strong electric field dependence of @xmath207 ( see eq .  ( 18 ) ) , the dependences of the averaged quantities on the components of the averaged electric field @xmath208 and @xmath209 ( where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the potential drop along the current and the hall current , respectively ) as well as their spectral dependences can be significantly different from those of the local dissipative current .",
