    "recently the small - world networks ( swns ) @xcitehave attracted much attention since it can mimic social and biological networks , internet connections , airline flights and other complex networks .",
    "well - established classical models have been numerically and analytically investigated , which focused on the crossover behavior @xcite , the scaling properties @xcite and the percolation of the dynamic processes @xcite in the model , etc . very recently",
    "zhu and xiong have generalized the swns to a quantum version by regarding the bonds as quantum hopping links for the motion of an electron and investigated the localization - delocalization transition of electron states@xcite . until now",
    "the transition point is found only by using the level statistics method combined with the finite - size scaling method@xcite .",
    "however the finite - size scaling method is not suitable for swns with high connections since the number of connections grows very rapidly with the swns size@xcite .",
    "the level statistics method is successful in the location of the metal - insulator transition in disorder systems @xcite , but it is not suitable in quasiperiodic systems because the level spacing distribution @xcite can not be always written as the crossover of poisson distribution and wigner - dyson distribution",
    ".    on the other hand , the connection between the entanglement ( such as von neumann entropy ) and localization properties of eigenstates is revealed recently . by measuring the von neumann entropy ,",
    "the local entanglement was studied at the ground state in the hubbard model for the dimer case @xcite and in the extended hubbard model for different band filling @xcite .",
    "it is found that the von neumann entropy is suitable to describe quantum phase transition @xcite and analyze the interplay between itinerant and localized feature@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study von neumann entropy for an electron moving in periodic , random and quasiperiodic quantum small - world networks(qswns ) , respectively . in periodic qswns , there are no localization - delocalization transitions because all eigenstates are extended . in random qswns , we find the spectrum averaged von neumann entropy is a suitable quantity to analyze the localization - delocalization transition of electron states .",
    "finally , we propose quasiperiodic qswns based on one - dimensional harper model . with the help of von neumann entropy",
    ", we find that there are two regions of the potential parameter in the model .",
    "the behaviors of electron states in different regions are similar to that of periodic and disorder qswns , respectively .",
