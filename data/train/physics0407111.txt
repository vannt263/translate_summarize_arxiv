    "the calibration was done before and after each of the measurements .",
    "we did not measure the floor - normal velocity , which suffers from mean shear and hence is less suited to studying vortex tubes than the spanwise velocity .",
    "the measurement positions were at @xmath30 m , where the boundary layer was well developed .",
    "the 99% thickness , i.e. , the height at which the mean streamwise velocity @xmath31 is 99% of its maximum value @xmath32 , was 0.8 m. the displacement thickness @xmath33 was 0.2 m. here @xmath34 is the height for the velocity @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the 99% thickness and displacement thickness were independent of the incoming - wind velocity .",
