    "protoplanetary disks are the birth - sites of planetary systems , and the mass distribution of disks relates directly to the masses of planets that may potentially form .",

    "measuring the distribution and time - evolution of disk mass around young stars provides critical constraints on planet formation .    a widely used method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for measuring disk masses is to observe emission from optically thin dust , and then use assumed grain properties to convert observed fluxes into dust masses .",
    "the assumed opacities imply that most of the dust mass still resides in particles smaller than about 1 mm .",
    "if mass is already sequestered in larger bodies like planetesimals ( which emit much less per unit mass ) , then the assumed opacities lead to underestimated disk masses .",
    "an assumed gas - to - dust ratio is then used to estimate the total ( gas+dust ) circumstellar mass .",
    "while gas dominates the total mass budget , the mass and surface density of solids are crucial for understanding core formation as well as the potential for accretion of giant planet atmospheres ( since fast core formation allows gas accretion before disk dispersal ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at short wavelengths ( @xmath10 @xmath11 m ) ,",
    "the dust in protoplanetary disks is optically thick even for masses @xmath12 m@xmath7 .",
    "observations at sub - mm and mm wavelengths are necessary to measure optically thin dust emission , and hence to determine the total mass of dust in the disk .    while disk masses have been well - studied in low - density star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , these are not the typical birth - sites of stars .",
    "most stars form in rich clusters like the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "isotopic abundances in our solar system suggest that it , too , may have formed in a dense , orion - like environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "expanding millimeter continuum surveys to include rich clusters allows the determination of the frequency and evolution of massive disks in typical star ( and planet ) formation environments .",
    "rich clusters are relatively challenging to observe because of their distances and high stellar density .",
    "high angular resolution and sensitivity are required .",
    "only a handful of rich clusters have been observed to date : the orion nebula cluster @xcite , ic 348 @xcite , and ngc 2024 @xcite .",
    "these existing surveys have detected very few disks with @xmath130.1 m@xmath7 of material , in part because of limited sensitivity and areal coverage .",
    "the large number of non - detections implies that the bulk of the disk mass distribution has not yet been constrained .",
    "indeed , stacking analysis of non - detected cluster members suggests average disk masses approximately 10 times smaller than the detection thresholds of previous surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we present a new 1.3 mm wavelength interferometric survey of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) with alma .",
    "the onc is the logical first choice for early alma observations , since it is a young , embedded stellar cluster comprised of hundred of stars spanning a broad mass range .",
    "the trapezium region contains hundreds of stars within a several arcminute radius , and pre - main - sequence evolutionary models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fitted to spectroscopic and/or photometric data indicate that most stars are less than approximately one million years old ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can therefore investigate here correlations of disk properties with stellar and/or environmental properties .",
    "we mapped a region around the omc1 bn / kl outflow in the orion nebula cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the primary goal of the program ( as proposed ) is to study the outflow in molecular lines , and this will be the topic of a companion paper . here",
    "we focus on the compact circumstellar disks within the imaged region .",
    "the map is comprised of 108 mosaicked pointings in the northwest region of the omc1 outflow and 39 pointings in the southeast region .",
    "the fields were observed at 230 ghz frequency ( band 6 ) , corresponding to a wavelength of 1.3 mm .",
    "observations were taken between 19 july 2014 and 05 april 2015 .",
    "the angular resolution of the observations was approximately @xmath14 . at the distance to orion , @xmath15",
    "pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the linear resolution is approximately 400 au .",
    "thus , any objects with radii smaller than @xmath16 au will be unresolved by these observations .",
    "alma compact array ( aca ) observations were also obtained as part of this program in order to map the extended outflow well , but we do not use these data here since our focus is on the compact disks .",
    "we observed continuum emission using four 1.875 ghz- wide bands centered at 216 , 228 , 231 , and 233 ghz .",
    "substantial parts of the bandpass contained spectral line emission and were flagged for the continuum data reduction .",
    "averaging continuum data over all spectral windows , the effective central frequency is 225 ghz .",
    "one 2 ghz window was devoted to co(2 - 1 ) at 231 ghz , and two other windows targeted c@xmath6o and sio at 218 ghz , and so at 216 ghz .",
    "all spectral windows had frequency resolution of about 1 mhz , providing velocity resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath17 .",
    "we adopted the reduced alma data products .",
    "the reduction included heavy flagging to remove strong spectral lines from the continuum , as well as the standard flux , bandpass , and gain calibrations .",
    "the sources used for calibration included j0607 - 0834 , j0541 - 0541 , j0423 - 013 , j0725 - 0054 , uranus , and ganymede .",
    "the @xmath18 data were inverted using a briggs robust weighting parameter of 0.5 , resulting in a synthesized beam with dimensions @xmath19 .",
    "the rms varies across the field because of strong extended emission from omc1 .",
    "typical noise values in clean regions of the continuum image are 0.5 mjy / beam .",
    "the noise is 5 mjy km s@xmath17 in a typical spectral line channel , although in channels with strong emission from the omc1 outflow the rms can rise to @xmath20 mjy km s@xmath17 .",
    "we searched for sub - mm emission toward the positions of known near - ir sources , because detection of sub - mm continuum flux would indicate disks ( as opposed to embedded spherical sources ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore make use of previous near - ir observations that identified cluster members @xcite .",
    "we supplement this catalog with new data , because the previous observations did not cover the complete region we mapped with alma .",
    "we observed the omc1 region in orion with gems at the gemini south telescope between 30 december 2012 and 28 february 2013 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "this dichotomy was interpreted as evidence that stars within the euv - dominated region of the trapezium stars experience significant disk evaporation , while disks can survive intact in the fuv - dominated region at larger cluster radii .",

    "it is therefore unclear whether stars that currently lie within 0.03 pc of @xmath53 ori c have been there for a substantial fraction of the lifetime of the cluster . on the other hand , it may be that the ionization front from @xmath53 ori c has turned on recently , uncovering proplyds as it advances through the cloud .",

    "observations of taurus suggest a significant correlation between disk and stellar mass @xcite . while we see no such correlation in the onc , at present the statistical significance of this result is limited both by the small number of alma detections and the small number of spectroscopically - determined stellar masses for extincted cluster members . to date",
    ", stellar masses have been determined spectroscopically for less than half of the sources in our alma - detected sample @xcite .",
    "we plot disk mass versus stellar mass for this sub - sample in figure [ fig : massmass ] . in the near future",
    ", deeper alma observations will yield a larger sample of disk masses , and near - ir spectroscopy will provide stellar masses of embedded cluster members in the onc .      while we determined dust masses above , and converted them to total gas+dust masses using an assumed gas - to - dust ratio , one can also use spectral line data to attempt to measure gas masses directly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "many proplyds , including some within 0.03 pc of @xmath53ori c , have radii greater than 100 au @xcite .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that the lack of co detections can be explained by unusually compact disks .",
    "the non - detection of any disk in the co data suggests a relative lack of gas in these disks . the gas - to - dust ratio is likely much smaller than 100",
    "this is consistent with previous results : @xcite inferred values of the gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath63 in taurus . in the onc , where strong ionization from @xmath53 c and the other trapezium stars can cause strong photoevaporative winds from circumstellar disks , we expect still lower gas - to - dust ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "detecting gas from disks in the onc likely requires better sensitivity than the observations presented here . assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 10",
    ", the distribution of @xmath64 values shown in figure [ fig : mdist ] suggests that we would need sufficient sensitivity to detect @xmath65 m@xmath5 of gas . using the lower limit from @xcite ,",
    "this could represent co(2 - 1 ) flux @xmath66 mjy km s@xmath17 .",
    "one caveat is that the strong molecular emission from the orion cloud could obscure gas emission from disks lying in the background .",
    "while most proplyds appear to reside in front of the cloud , it is possible that some gas - rich disks in the background could be missed .",
    "there are strong detections of a few large proplyds at relatively large cluster radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such large , gas - rich disks would be more likely to photoevaporate if they resided close to the trapezium stars .",
    "thus , the gas content of many , if not most , disks in the onc , may be substantially lower than these examples .      the disk mass distribution shown in figure [ fig : mdist ] indicates that only a small percentage of onc cluster members have masses comparable to or larger than the mmsn . adopting 10 @xmath67 as the minimum value of the mmsn @xcite",
    ", we find 12 disks above this level . compared to the @xmath0 near - ir and optically identified cluster members surveyed , this represents a detection rate of only 2% .",
    "such a low detection rate may be at odds with the known existence of giant planets around other stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "around fgk stars , the detection rate of planets more massive than jupiter is @xmath68 , and extrapolation to larger orbital radii suggests that up to 20% of fgk stars in the galaxy may host giant planets @xcite .",
    "the detection rate around m dwarfs is @xmath6910 times lower , @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses in the onc peaks at 0.2 m@xmath7 @xcite , implying most cluster members are m dwarfs .    a giant planet detection rate near 2% may therefore be be an appropriate benchmark in this case .",
    "since @xmath52 of onc cluster members in our survey have disk masses similar to the mmsn , the planet formation potential in this young region seems close to the final outcomes seen around main - sequence m dwarfs in the field .",
    "however the disk masses plotted in figure [ fig : mdist ] assume a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "the non - detection of any sources in co emission ( as well as previous results for young stars in taurus ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that this ratio may be substantially lower . in that case , the fraction of disks with total masses greater than 10 m@xmath5 could approach zero .    according to the approach used to derive the mmsn ,",
    "this would imply that none of the systems in the onc can form jupiter - mass planets .",
    "however this conclusion can be avoided if we re - examine a key assumption in the mmsn model .",
    "specifically , that model assumes that all of the heavy elements in jupiter and other planets had to condense out from solar - composition gas . if there is sufficient dust to build planetary cores ( perhaps from an earlier condensation event ) , then a much smaller amount of gas is needed to build the planetary atmospheres .",
    "for example , a 30 m@xmath70 solid core , massive enough to accrete a large gaseous atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , requires only @xmath31 m@xmath5 of solar - composition gas to become a jupiter - like planet .",
    "it is the mass of disk solids , which determine the formation timescale of a crossover - mass core , that provides a tighter constraint on planet - formation potential . a more accurate definition for the minimum mass of dust and gas needed to form a planetary system like ours may be @xmath71 m@xmath72 of dust and @xmath28 m@xmath5 of gas .",
    "this argument suggests that 2% is the correct number for gauging giant planet formation potential , since a gas+dust mass of 10 m@xmath5 in figure [ fig : mdist ] corresponds to 0.1 m@xmath5 of dust .",
    "accounting for uncertain dust opacity ( i.e. , mass hidden in already - grown pebbles or planetesimals ) , the solid content of disks in the onc may be still higher than inferred above .",
    "lower dust opacities , which account for this hidden mass of solids , are physically plausible as long as they do not push the high end of the inferred disk mass distribution into a gravitationally unstable regime . assuming most stars in our sample have masses @xmath65 m@xmath7 , we would surmise that disks could not have total masses larger than @xmath61 m@xmath7 ( 100 m@xmath5 ) because disks more massive would become gravitationally unstable .",
    "figure [ fig : mdist ] suggests that adjusting the distribution up substantially , to account for uncertain opacity , is not physically plausible if the gas - to - dust ratio is 100 , since it would produce some disks with more than 100 m@xmath5 of material .",
    "however if the gas - to - dust ratio is only 10 , then such an adjustment is allowed on physical grounds .",
    "such an adjustment might also produce many systems with sufficient solids to form giant planet cores within gas disk lifetimes .",
    "we presented alma observations of compact emission from protoplanetary disks in the omc1 outflow region of the orion nebula .",
    "we mosaicked a field containing @xmath0 near - ir - identified young stars , of which approximately 100 are known proplyds identified with hst .",
    "we detected continuum emission at 1 mm wavelengths towards @xmath1 of the proplyd sample , and @xmath2% of the larger sample of near - ir objects .    using standard assumptions about the dust opacities and gas - to - dust ratios",
    ", we converted our measured fluxes into dust and dust+gas disk masses .",
    "the 4@xmath3 detection threshold in our map corresponds to a ( dust+gas ) disk mass of @xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "the fraction of disks with more than 10 m@xmath5 is @xmath52 , similar to the detection rate of planets around m dwarfs ; m dwarfs are the dominant stellar constituent of the onc .",
    "none of the sources detected in continuum emission are seen in co(2 - 1 ) or c@xmath6o(2 - 1 ) emission .",
    "while computing the emission in a single transition is highly uncertain , even the full range of existing models predicts that disks with gas - to - dust ratio of 100 would be detected in our observations .",
    "since none were , we suggest that disks in this region have gas - to - dust ratios that are substantially lower than 100 .",
    "the disks detected here , which appear to be gas poor , still have substantial solid content . with a standard dust opacity assumption",
    ", our measurements suggest that 2% of disks have enough solids to build jupiter - mass cores .",
    "however solids may already be sequestered in larger bodies at the age of our sample , in which case our measurements would be consistent with higher solid disk masses .",
    "such disks are physically plausible , because the low gas - to - dust ratio means that high solid masses need not lead to global gravitational instability . since uncertain opacities allow inferred dust disk masses to be adjusted upwards , the potential for giant planet formation likely exists around significantly more than 2% of onc cluster members .",

    "<S> none of these disks are detected in contemporaneous co(2 - 1 ) or c@xmath6o(2 - 1 ) observations , suggesting that the gas - to - dust ratios may be substantially smaller than the canonical value of 100 . </S>",
