    "the rationale for the _ xmm_-large scale structure ( _ xmm_-lss ) survey was presented in @xcite . a first catalogue for the 5.5 @xmath0   surveyed until year 2003 was presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in the present paper",
    ", we supersede the first release with a new version which covers the entire 11.1 @xmath0area of the survey .",
    "all the data were processed or re - processed afresh with the latest version of our pipeline ( see section [ secxamin ] ) .",
    "we release two families of x - ray database tables ( see section [ seconline ] ) , a standard catalogue ( termed 2xlss ) for event files truncated to a common uniform exposure of 10 ks , and a _ deeper _ catalogue ( termed 2xlssd ) using the full exposure time .    the _ xmm_-lss survey area , located around @xmath1   @xmath2 , was covered in the optical band by the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey wide and deep synoptic fields ( cfhtls - w1 and d1 ) ; in the nir band partially by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) ; in the ir by the _",
    "spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ) ; and in the uv by the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ; @xcite ) all - sky survey .",
    "we release also a multiwavelength database table ( using data from the sources just described ) in conjunction with each of the x - ray table families .",
    "data from the present catalogue have already been used in other works , published , submitted or in preparation , e.g. , , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ secnewcat ] we describe the layout and content of our catalogue , in particular section [ seconline ] presents our database system by which users can have public access to the entire data tables and associated data products ( a reduced summary will be available via the centre de donnes de strasbourg [ cds ] ) ; section [ secnewproc ] describes the x - ray data processing and section [ secopt ] the generation of the multiwavelength catalogue .",
    "finally some statistics are presented in section [ secstat ] , and concluding remarks in section [ secconclusion ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,>,<,<,<,>,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     probabilities of chance association between a counterpart and an x - ray source are computed using formula ( [ eq1 ] ) in section  [ secoptprob ] , where the density @xmath3 is computed from simple linear fits as reported in table [ tabprob ] .",
    "the same table indicates also the magnitudes or fluxes used to look - up at the density for the appropriate band .",
    "we did only a rough estimate of the parametrization of the density for the entire _",
    "xmm_-lss area , neglecting any possible spatial variation .",
    "x - ray to cfhtls probability , called @xmath4 , is computed for sources with a cfhtls counterpart in the order : d1 if present , else w1 . in the case of undefined cfhtls magnitudes ,",
    "the pointing tile limiting magnitude was used ( read directly from the w1 table , or fixed to @xmath5 for d1 ) .",
    "the other probabilities , x - ray to swire probability @xmath6 , x - ray to ukidss probability @xmath7 , and x - ray to galex probability @xmath8 , are computed as given in the notes in table [ tabprob ] .",
    "a probability of 99 ( `` undefined '' ) is assigned whenever it could not be computed .",
    "a statistics of the probability ranking defined in section  [ secoptprob ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fighisto ] .",
    "this figure indicates an acceptable tuning with the cfhtls , swire and ukidss catalogues , while _ galex _ data are perhaps _ overtuned _ in the sense that there is an excess of good probabilities .",
    "this may indicate that the probability computation has to be revised .",
    "we provide here details on the comparisons : ( a ) between 2xlssd   and version i xlss   ( section  [ secxstatnewold ] ) ; ( b ) between 2xlssopt and 2xlssoptd ( section [ secappcompoct ] ) ; ( c ) between our catalogues and the xmds one ( section [ secappxmds ] ) ; ( d ) between our catalogues and the 2xmm one ( section [ secappwatson ] ) .",
    "we first checked that the new pipeline version provides results consistent with the previous idl version by performing detailed tests on simulated and real _ xmm _",
    "the detection parts of both pipelines give nearly identical results for point - like and extended sources .",
    "the characterization parts ( maximum likelihood fitting ) are in excellent agreement for point - like sources . regarding extended sources , comparison of fluxes , sizes and likelihoods estimates from the two pipelines are in very good agreement .",
    "some differences do however show up for individual faint sources or sources close to the detector borders and gaps .",
    "these differences can be attributed to statistical fluctuations , and comparing these values to the input characteristics of simulated sources in a statistical sense , we conclude that both pipelines perform equivalently .",
    "finally we compared directly the results .",
    "the association between sources in the version 2 catalogues ( 2xlss   and 2xlssd ) with the earlier xlss   release ( in the smaller area covered by the latter ) is possible using the database column @xmath9 , as explained in section  [ secnaming ] .",
    "2824 sources are common between xlss   and 2xlssd   ( out of 3385 in xlss ) .",
    "there are 452 objects appearing only in 2xlssd   in the pointings covered by xlss , and 561 xlss   objects not confirmed in 2xlssd . a majority ( respectively 95% of the former and 88% of the latter ) have a poor detection likelihood ( @xmath10 corresponding conventionally to @xmath11 ) . as an example of the rather good agreement between the two catalogue versions ( mainly between the older and newer xamin   version , and",
    "also between the 6   vs 10   band merging ) we compare the fluxes between xlss   and 2xlssd   ( which makes sense since xlss   was also using full exposures ) , via the plots given in fig .",
    "[ figcompa3 ] .",
    "there are 20837 potential counterpart sets for 6721 x - ray sources in input for 2xlssoptd , and 16813 for 5572 sources for 2xlssopt ( the comparison includes negative rank _ rejected _ counterparts since rejection may act differently because of the displacement ) . of these , 1188 entries ( for 428 x - ray sources )",
    "in 2xlssopt have no obvious correspondent in the deep 2xlssoptd .                            in 38 additional cases ( only 0.2% of the common ones )",
    "the counterpart set is the same between a couple of 2xlssopt and 2xlssoptd entries , but the latter are not associated by column @xmath12 .",
    "i.e. two sources have the same counterpart set but are not the closest . in 10 cases",
    "this is due to ambiguous band merging , but in the rest ( which is anyhow an extremely small number ) this probably means that there are two 10 ks sources both displaced from but close to a given full exposure one ( or v.v . ) .",
    "the 2171 remaining 2xlssopt counterpart sets ( covering 1479 individual 2xlss   x - ray sources ) can be _ altogether different _ from all counterpart sets in 2xlssoptd for the associated x - ray source ( the x - ray source position moved so much that entire counterpart sets are farther than 6   from either position ) , or may partially match ( from 1 to 4 out of the 5 d1 , w1 , swire , ukidss or galex catalogues ) .",
    "a different approach for the comparison is to consider only the _ best counterparts _ i.e. those ranked 0 - 1 ( by definition one per x - ray source ) .",
    "let us exclude the 1607 2xlssoptd ( 24% of 6721 ) x - ray sources not confirmed in the 10ks catalogue , and the 528 2xlssopt ( 8% of 5572 ) new in the 10ks catalogue , and let us concentrate on the common sources . of their best counterparts :                          a subset of the xmds ( _ xmm _  medium deep survey ) data was published as the xmds / vvds @xmath14 catalogue (; the same paper contained also the logn - logs of the entire catalogue ) .",
    "contextually to the release of the entire xmds catalogue through our database contextually with version 2 _ xmm_-lss ones ( see table  [ tabtables ] ) , we report here some details of a comparison between the catalogues presented in this paper ( mainly 2xlssd ) and xmds .      1 .",
    "the xmds covers the fields g01 to g19 in table  [ tabpointing ] 2 .",
    "xmds data were analysed with a _ fully independent _ ( and more traditional ) pipeline based on the one by @xcite .",
    "the xmds pipeline uses the sas to detect candidates in 5 energy bands simultaneously ( and not in 2 independent bands with later merging ) operating on event files merged from all 3 _ xmm _  cameras and from the entire _ xmm _  field of view ( not just the central 13 ) , 4 .",
    "it then applies the @xcite characterization , which is robust but oriented to point sources only ( unlike the wavelet method in xamin   which handles better extended sources ) .",
    "the event pattern selection is different ( non - standard and broader in xmds ) .",
    "the removal of redundant sources is handled differently , in particular the primary detection is chosen differently , the position is inherited from the primary detection , but the flux is obtained stacking data from all overlapping pointings .",
    "the astrometric correction offsets are different . 8 .",
    "also the xmds catalogue does not include spurious objects ( but only those above a probability threshold ) , so the difference between the raw database table and the catalogue is only due to the overlap removal procedure .        as anticipated in section  [ secxmds ] ,",
    "the xmds catalogue includes 1168 sources , by definition all in the g - labelled fields .",
    "comparison with the 2xlssd   or 2xlss   catalogues may also involve adjacent b fields if the _ xmm_-lss overlap removal procedure preferred those .",
    "the association between xmds and _ xmm_-lss sources is done within a radius of 10 .",
    "the comparison occurs naturally with the deep catalogue , because it involves the _ same _ input ( odf ) event data ( for the full exposures ) with different pipelines and procedures . of those 1168 objects :                  similarly 43 are potential ultrasoft sources ( the band with the highest s / n ratio in xmds is the a band [ 0.3 - 0.5 kev ] , which is not processed by the current release of xamin ) , so they are legitimately excluded ;                concerning the distance between the ( astrometrically corrected ) x - ray positions in the xmds and 2xlssd   catalogues , 58% of the sources are closer than 2 , 88% closer than 4   and only 4% more distant than 6 , in general concentrated among the sources with lesser significance , and the few extended ones .",
    "the agreement between xmds and 2xlssd   positions , peaking around 1 , is better than the typical inter - band distance between 2xlssd   detections in the two energy bands , which peaks around 2 . compare panels ( d ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ figdisthisto ] .",
    "we have cross calibrated graphically the detection likelihood of xamin   with the chance probability of the xmds ( for definition see @xcite ) and the detection likelihood of xamin   with the significance in terms of number of @xmath17 of the xmds ( see and references therein ) .",
    "we only show the latter in fig .",
    "[ xmdssn ] .",
    "one can see that a likelihood of 75 corresponds more or less to the @xmath14 level , and one of 40 to the @xmath16 level .",
    "the xmds by construction includes measurements in all 5 energy bands even if the source is above the probability threshold only in one .",
    "if we consider as good detections for xmds only those with @xmath18 in the band , we have that , of the sources in common with 2xlssd :          the fluxes , computed for xmds according to the prescriptions of @xcite and for _ xmm_-lss as explained in section  [ secflux ] , are compared in fig .",
    "[ xmdsflux ] .",
    "extended sources classified c1 are excluded as their 2xlssd   flux is set to undefined .",
    "the fluxes match qualitatively , although there is a systematic difference : namely 2xlssd   fluxes are 0.895 lower than the xmds fluxes in the b band , while they are only 1.040 higher in the cd band .",
    "it can be seen that a larger scatter in fluxes occurs for the sources which have poorer significance in either catalogue , while outliers are generally due to sources presumably falling near a chip gap on one detector ( and as such characterized by a fluxflag of 2 ) , or exceptionally by residual c2 extended sources ( for which the _ xmm_-lss flux is computed from the point - like rate ) .",
    "it is also possible , similarly to what was done in section [ seccompoct ] , to compare the counterparts in optical ( and other ) bands between the xmds catalogue and one of our _ xmm_-lss catalogues .",
    "in doing this one should consider :    1 .   that the identification procedure for xmds is historically different from the one used here , in particular it was done in several incremental steps , and uses distances capped to 2   in the computation of probabilities , 2 .   that the catalogues used for xmds were in larger number ( for a total of 27 ) and included many other , including older , data sources ( e.g. vvds , radio data , simbad and ned , cfhtls t003 , etc . )",
    "therefore we present a comparison limited to the 2xlssoptd catalogue ( the one which matches better xmds in exposures ) , and , for xmds , to _",
    "reduced counterpart sets _ considering only cfhtls t004 d1 and w1 , swire dr6 and galex .",
    "ukidss was not included since 2xlssoptd uses release dr5 , while xmds used release dr3 .",
    "more specifically we consider only the 1057 x - ray sources in common between xmds and 2xlssd , as described in [ secappxmdsx ] .",
    "they correspond to 4316 counterpart sets ( of any rank ) in 2xlssoptd and 4916 in xmds .",
    "we found that a large fraction ( 3620 ) of the possible counterpart sets are identical ( i.e. they have the same counterparts , irrespective of ranking , in both catalogues ) .",
    "we quickly compared our 2xlssd   catalogue with the 2xmm catalogue .",
    "namely we used the 2xmmi - dr3 `` slim '' reduced catalogue , which contains exposure - merged sources ( not individual detections ) , and thus somewhat compare with our post overlap - removal catalogues .",
    "we restricted a comparison to a rectangular area fully encompassing 2xlssd   and noticed that such an area includes precisely just our pointings , with the only exception of a single additional pointing centered on the bright star mira ceti ( obsid 014850  0201 ) .",
    "the rectangular area contains 6181 2xmm sources . since the slim catalogue does not contain indication on the pointings , we can tentatively flag sources in the mira ceti field as the 60 within 13   from the respective pointing centre .",
    "we checked the association with our 6721 2xlssd   sources within the customary radius of 10 .",
    "we find :          we note that 59% of the unassociated 2xlssd   sources have a rather poor likelihood ( @xmath19 ) , and 93% are below @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath16 ) . despite the different definition of the 2xmm likelihood ( parameter @xmath21 )",
    ", we note that of 1141 unassociated 2xmm sources , 67% have @xmath22 .    of the associated cases ,",
    "all but 69 have a single association .",
    "the ambiguous ones are all plain couples , and usually well separated ( one 2xmm source at 1 - 2   from the 2xlssd   position , and the other at 8 - 9 ) .",
    "the distance between the astrometrically corrected position ( 2xmm used the usno catalogue for this purpose ) for the associated primary ( closest ) cases is within 2   in 55% of the cases , within 4   in 86% and within 6   in 95% ( while 90% of the 69 secondaries are above 6 ) .",
    "the histogram of distances however peaks at a 1   offset ( not unlike xmds vs 2xlssd ) .",
    "the common subset contains 100 of our extended sources , and 88 2xmm extended sources ( i.e. those with their parameter @xmath23 ) .",
    "56 are considered extended in both catalogues .",
    "110 of our extended sources do not appear at all in 2xmm , and 113 2xmm extended sources do not appear in 2xlssd .",
    "the 2xmm slim catalogue does not contain count rates .",
    "it contains fluxes in several energy bands , but these are different from ours .",
    "we can directly compare the sum of 2xmm bands 2 and 3 with our b band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) , while at harder energies we can compare the sum of 2xmm bands 4 and 5 ( 2 - 12 kev ) with our cd band ( 2 - 10 kev ) .    the comparison of the fluxes is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2xmm ] .",
    "the average 2xmm/2xlssd   flux ratio for common point - like sources is 0.92 in the soft band ( same energy range ) , and 1.22 in the hard bands ( where 2xmm extends 2 kev further ) .",
    "again , considering the differences in the pipelines , the agreement is acceptable ."
