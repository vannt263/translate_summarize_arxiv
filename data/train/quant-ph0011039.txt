    "transfer of information was the focus of attention [ 1 - 3 ] of research on decoherence since the early days . in the intervening two decades",
    "this perspective was not forgotten [ 4 ] , but the study of different mechanisms of decoherence [ 5 - 9 ] took precedence over considerations of information - theoretic nature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to sketch a few ideas which tie the `` traditional '' points of view of einselection and decoherence ( especially the issue of the preferred pointer basis ) to various other aspects of decoherence that have a strong connection with information - theoretic concepts .",
    "a large part of our discussion shall be based on a simple model of conditional dynamics , which is a direct generalization of the `` bit by bit '' measurement introduced in [ 1 ] and studied in [ 3 ] .",
    "we shall introduce the model in section 2 and use it to compute the  price \" of information in units of action in section 3 .",
    "section 4 defines information theoretic quantum _",
    "discord _ between two classically identical definitions of mutual information .",
    "discord can be regarded as a measure of a violation of classicality of a joint state of two quantum subsystems .",
    "section 5 turns to the evolution of the state of the environment in course of decoherence .",
    "the _ redundancy ratio _ introduced there can be regarded as a measure of objectivity of quantum states .",
    "a large redundancy ratio is a sufficient condition for an effective classicality of quantum states .",
    "the simplest example of an entangling quantum evolution is known as the controlled not ( c - not ) .",
    "it involves two bits ( a `` control '' and a `` target '' ) .",
    "their interaction leads to :    @xmath0 @xmath1 where the state @xmath2 is defined through a basis - dependent negation :    @xmath3    classical c - not `` flips '' the target bit whenever the control is in the state `` 1 '' , but does nothing otherwise .",
    "quantum c - not is an obvious generalization .",
    "the distinction between the classical and quantum c - not comes from the fact that both quantum and classical bits can be in an arbitrary superposition .",
    "thus , c - not starting from a superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 will in general lead to an entangled state .",
    "moreover , when both the control and the target start in hadamard - transformed states : @xmath6 c - not reverses direction :    @xmath7 @xmath8    above , we have dropped labels : the original control is always to the left , as was the case in eq .",
    "we say `` the original '' , because the hadamard transform of eq .",
    "( 3 ) reverses the direction of the information flow in the quantum c - not . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the sign of the former control ( left ket ) flips when the former target is in the state @xmath9",
    ".    study of such simple models has led to the concept of preferred pointer states [ 1 ] and einselection [ 2,3 ] .",
    "we shall not review here these well known developments , directing the reader instead to the already available [ 10 ] or forthcoming [ 11 ] reviews of the subject .",
    "controlled shift ( c - shift ) is a straightforward generalization of c - not .",
    "the original truth table ( an analogue of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) can be written as : @xmath10 \" and  the apparatus @xmath11 \" , reflecting this nomenclature in notation ) .",
    "equation ( 5 ) implies eq .",
    "( 1 ) when both @xmath12 and @xmath11 have two - dimensional hilbert spaces",
    ". moreover , when @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes a model of a pre - measurement : @xmath14 as in the case of c - not , in the respective bases latexmath:[$\\ {    imply a one - way flow of information , from @xmath12 to @xmath11 .",
    "however , a complementary basis [ 12,13 ] can be readily defined : @xmath16 it is analogous to the hadamard transform we have introduced before , but it also has an obvious affinity to the fourier transform",
    ". we shall call it a hadamard - fourier transform ( hft ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the orthonormality of @xmath17 immediately implies : @xmath18 the inverse of hft can be easily given : @xmath19 consequently , for an arbitrary @xmath20 ; @xmath21 to implement the truth table of eq .",
    "( 5 ) we shall use observables of the apparatus :    @xmath22 @xmath23    as well as the observable of the system : @xmath24 the interaction hamiltonian of the form ; @xmath25 acting over a period @xmath26 will induce a transition ; @xmath27    selected so that the associated action is @xmath28 a perfect one - to - one correlation between the states of the system and of the apparatus can be accomplished , since : @xmath29 has to be evaluated modulo @xmath30 ( where @xmath30 is the number of the orthogonal states of the apparatus ) so that when @xmath31 , the apparatus states can `` rotate '' through @xmath32 and stop where the interaction takes it .",
    "the integer @xmath33 can be regarded as the gain factor . as eqs .",
    "( 14 ) - ( 17 ) imply , the adjacent states of the system ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) get mapped onto the states of the apparatus that are @xmath33 apart `` on the dial '' .    when the dimension of the hilbert space of the system @xmath35 is such that @xmath36 the above model provides one with a simple example of amplification .",
    "it is possible to use it to study the utility of amplification in increasing signal to noise ratio in measurements [ 11 ] .",
    "it also shows why amplification can bring about decoherence and effective irreversibility ( although c - shift is of course perfectly reversible ) .",
    "we shall employ c - shift to study the cost of information transfer , to introduce information ",
    "theoretic discord , the measure of the classicality of correlations , and to discuss objectivity of quantum states which arises from the redundancy of the records imprinted by the state of the system on its environment .",
    "transfer of information is the objective of the measurement process and an inevitable consequence of most interactions .",
    "it happens in course of decoherence .",
    "here we shall quantify its cost in the units of action .",
    "the consequence of the interaction between @xmath12 and @xmath37 is the correlated state @xmath38 , eq .",
    "while the joint state of @xmath39 is pure , each of the subsystems is in a mixed state given by the reduced density matrix of the system    @xmath40    the correlation brought about by the interaction , eq .",
    "( 6 ) , leads to the loss of information about @xmath12 and @xmath11 individually .",
    "the entropy of each increases to @xmath41 as the evolution of the whole @xmath39 is unitary , the entropies of the subsystems must be compensated by the decrease of their mutual entropy , i.e. , by the increase of their mutual information : @xmath42 above , @xmath43 is the joint entropy of @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity , eq .",
    "( 21 ) , was introduced in the quantum context as a measure of entanglement some time ago [ 3 ] and has been since rediscovered and used [ 14 ] .",
    "the cost of a bit of information in terms of some other physical quantity is an often raised question . in the context of our model",
    "we shall inquire what is the cost of a bit transfer in terms of action .",
    "let us then consider a transition represented by eq .",
    "the associated action must be no less than @xmath45 when @xmath46 are mutually orthogonal , the action is :    @xmath47    in planck ( @xmath48 ) units .",
    "this estimate can be lowered by using a judiciously chosen initial @xmath32 which is a superposition of the outcomes @xmath49 .",
    "for a two - dimensional hilbert space the average action can be thus brought down to @xmath50 [ 1,3 ] . in general ,",
    "an interaction of the form @xmath51 saturates at the lower bound given by    @xmath52    as the dimensionality of the hilbert spaces increases , the least action approaches @xmath53 per completely entangling interaction .",
    "the action per bit will be less when , for a given @xmath30 , the transferred information is maximized , which happens when @xmath54 in eq .",
    "then the cost of information in planck units is @xmath55 the cost of information per bit decreases with increasing @xmath30 , the dimension of the hilbert space of the smaller of the two entangled systems .",
    "this result is at the same time both enlightening and disappointing : it shows that the cost of information transfer is not `` fixed '' ( as one might have hoped ) .",
    "rather , the least total amount of action needed for a complete entanglement is at least asymptotically fixed as eqs .",
    "( 23 ) show .",
    "consequently , the least price per bit goes down when information is transferred `` wholesale '' , i.e. , when @xmath30 is large . yet , this is enlightening , as it may indicate why in the classical continuous world ( where @xmath30 is effectively infinite ) one may be ignorant of that price and convinced that information is free .",
    "mutual information can be defined either by the symmetric formula , eq .",
    "( 21 ) , or through an asymmetric looking equation which employs conditional entropy : @xmath56 above , @xmath57 expresses the average ignorance of @xmath12 remaining after the observer has found out the state of @xmath37 . in classical physics , the two formulae , eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 26 ) , are strictly identical , so that the _ discord _ between them :    @xmath58 always disappears [ 15 ] : @xmath59    in quantum physics things are never this simple : to begin with , conditional information depends on the observer finding out about one of the subsystems , which implies a measurement .",
    "so @xmath60 must be carefully defined before eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) become meaningful .",
    "conditional entropy is non - trivial in the quantum context because , in general , in order to find out @xmath57 one must choose a set of projection operators @xmath61 and define a conditional density matrix given by the outcome corresponding to @xmath61 through @xmath62 where in the simplest case @xmath63 is a projection operator onto a pure state of the apparatus . a normalized @xmath64 can be obtained by using the probability of the outcome @xmath65 @xmath66    the conditional density matrix @xmath67 represents the description of the system @xmath12 available to the observer who knows that the apparatus @xmath11 is in a subspace defined by @xmath61 . for a pure initial state and an exhaustive measurement",
    "the conditional density matrix will also be pure .",
    "we shall however consider a broader range of possibilities , including joint density matrices which undergo a decoherence process , so that @xmath68 this transition is accompanied by an increase in entropy @xmath69 and by the simultaneous disappearance of the ambiguity in what was measured [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "now , @xmath64 is no longer pure , unless @xmath70 .",
    "that is , a measurement of the apparatus in bases other than the pointer basis will leave an observer with varying degrees of ignorance about the state of the system .",
    "more general cases when the density matrix is neither a pure pre - decoherence projection operator @xmath71 to the left of the arrow in eq .",
    "( 31 ) nor a completely decohered @xmath72 state on the right are possible and typical .    to define discord @xmath73 we finalize our definition of @xmath60 : @xmath74 above",
    ", we have used an obvious notation for the density matrix conditioned upon pure states @xmath75 .",
    "we emphasize again that the conditional entropy depends on @xmath76 , but also on the choice of the observable measured on @xmath11 . in classical physics",
    "all observables commute , so there is no such dependence .",
    "thus , non - commutation of observables in quantum theory is the ultimate source of the information - theoretic discord .",
    "the obvious use for the discord is to employ it as a measure of how non - classical the underlying correlation of two quantum systems is . in particular , when there exists a set of states in one of the two systems in which the discord disappears , the state represented by @xmath76 admits a classical interpretation of probabilities in that special basis . moreover , unless the discord disappears for trivial reasons ( which would happen in the absence of correlation , i.e. , when @xmath77 ) , the basis which minimizes the discord can be regarded as  the most classical \" . for @xmath78 the states of such preferred basis and",
    "their corresponding eigenvalues can be treated as effectively classical [ 11 ] .",
    "the vanishing discord is a stronger condition than the absence of entanglement . in effect",
    ", @xmath78 implies existence of the eigenstates of @xmath76 which are products of the states of @xmath12 and of @xmath11 .",
    "an instructive example of this situation arises as a result of decoherence : when the off - diagonal terms of @xmath76 disappear in a manner illustrated by eq .",
    "( 31 ) , the discord disappears as well .",
    "the discussion of decoherence to date tends to focus on the effect of the environment on the system or on the apparatus .",
    "the destruction of quantum coherence and the emergence of preferred pointer observables whose eigenvalues are associated with the decoherence - free pointer subspaces was the focus of the investigation .    here",
    "we shall break with this tradition . according to the theory of decoherence , the environment is monitoring the system .",
    "therefore , its state must contain a record of the system .",
    "it is of obvious interest to analyze the nature and the role of this record . to this end",
    ", we shall use mutual information introduced before defining the _ redundancy ratio _ @xmath79 above , we imagined a setting where the system is decohering due to the interaction with the environment which is composed of many subsystems @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 is a measure of how many times  how redundantly  the information about the system has been inscribed in the environment .",
    "an essentially identical formula can be introduced using the asymmetric @xmath82 , eq .",
    "it is easy to establish that the discord is always non - negative and , hence , that @xmath83 the subscript indicating maximization may refer to two distinct procedures : @xmath84 will obviously depend on the manner in which subsystems of the environment are measured .",
    "in fact , it is convenient to use @xmath85 to define a basis - dependent @xmath86 in a manner analogous to eq .",
    "( 33 ) . maximizing @xmath87 with respect to the choice of the choice of states @xmath88",
    "[ 11 ] is an obvious  counterpoint \" to the predictability sieve [ 16 - 19 ] , the strategy which seeks states that entangle the least with the environment .",
    "there is one more maximization procedure which may and should be considered : the environment can be partitioned differently  for example , it may turn out that more information about the system can be extracted by measuring , say , the photon environment in some collective fashion ( homodyne ? ) instead of directly counting the environment photons .",
    "it is clear that for such optimization to be physically significant , it should respect to some degree the natural structure of the environment .",
    "in addition to the redundancy ratio one can define the rate at which the redundancy ratio increases . the redundancy rate is defined as @xmath89 either the basis dependent or the basis - independent versions of @xmath90 may be of interest .",
    "the physical significance of the redundancy ratio rate is clear : it shows how quickly the information about the system spreads throughout the environment .",
    "it is , in effect , a measure of the rate of increase of the effective number of the environment subsystems which have recorded the state of the system @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that either @xmath91 or @xmath92 can keep on increasing after the density matrix of the system has lost its off - diagonal terms in the pointer basis and after it can be therefore considered completely decohered . indeed , direct interaction between the system and the environment is not needed for either @xmath93 to change .",
    "for example , information about the system inscribed in the primary environment may be communicated to a secondary , tertiary , and more remote environment ( which need not interact with the system at all ) .",
    "it is natural to define objectivity and , therefore , classicality with the help of @xmath93 . in the limit",
    "@xmath94 the information about the preferred states of the system is spread so widely that it can be acquired by many observers simultaneously [ 11 ] .",
    "moreover , it already exists in multiple copies , so it can be safely cloned in spite of the no - cloning theorem [ 20 ] .",
    "thus , a state of the system redundantly recorded in the environment has all the symptoms of `` objective existence '' .",
    "in particular , such well - advertised states can be found out without being disturbed by approximately @xmath93 observers acting independently [ 11,21 ] ( each simply measuring the state of @xmath95 fraction of the environment ) .",
    "information theory offers a useful perspective on the measurement process , on decoherence and , above all , on the definitions of classicality .",
    "discord can be used to characterize the nature of quantum correlations and to distinguish the ones that are classical .",
    "the redundancy ratio is a powerful measure of the classicality of states : while a vanishing discord is a necessary condition for classicality of correlations , the redundancy ratio is a direct measure of objective existence of quantum states .",
    "objectivity can be defined operationally as the ability to find what the state is without disturbing it [ 11,21 ] .",
    "objective existence of quantum states would make them effectively classical , and was the ultimate goal of the interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "we have established it here by investigating einselection from the point of view of information theory and by shifting focus from the system to the environment which is monitoring the system .",
    "these advances clarify some of the interpretational issues which are now a century old .",
    "the relation between the epistemological and ontological significance of the quantum state vectors is now apparent : objective existence of the quantum states is a direct consequence of the redundant records permeating the environment .",
