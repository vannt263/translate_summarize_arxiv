    "another generalization of density functional theory to treat excited states is the ensemble density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , a different and quite promising method to calculate excited states based on time - dependent density functional theory has been developed  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach  @xcite is to calculate excitation energies perturbatively using the non - interacting kohn - sham hamiltonian as the zeroth - order hamiltonian . in the kohn - sham formulation of density",
    "functional theory  @xcite , the interacting electron system is replaced by a system of non - interacting electrons in an effective local potential that yields the true ground state density . in the perturbative approach ,",
    "the zeroth - order excitation energies are simply the differences of kohn - sham eigenvalues .",
    "remarkably , it has been recently shown  @xcite that , for atomic systems , the excitation energies obtained as differences of kohn - sham eigenvalues lie between the triplet and singlet experimental excitation energies , corrected for relativistic and finite nuclear mass effects , with the exception of the @xmath2 transition of ionized lithium .",
    "this finding is surprising since , except for the highest occupied orbital , there is no strict relationship between the kohn - sham eigenvalues and excitation energies .    in an attempt to improve on these results and determine the singlet - triplet splitting , we calculate excitation energies to first - order in perturbation theory .",

    "in order to evaluate the excitation energies to first - order in the coupling constant ( eqs .  [ de0 ] ,  [ de1 t ] and  [ de1s ] ) and in the more standard perturbation scheme , we need to determine an accurate exchange - correlation potential , kohn - sham orbitals and eigenvalues and the exchange component of the exchange - correlation potential for the system of interest .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] , the accurate exchange - correlation potential used in eq .  [ ks ] for the determination of the kohn - sham orbitals and eigenvalues is obtained starting from an accurate density and searching for a potential that yields the desired density as a solution of the kohn - sham equations ( eq .",

    "the exchange component of the exchange - correlation potential is simply given by the condition that it cancels the self - interaction term in the hartree potential in the case of two electrons in the singlet ground state .",
    "for a many - electron system , the exchange potential is obtained as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and in tables  [ table1 ] ,  [ table2 ] and  [ table3 ] , we show the excitation energies to zeroth - order and to first - order in the two perturbative schemes for helium , ionized lithium and beryllium respectively .",
    "the zeroth - order excitation energies are simply given by the difference in the kohn - sham eigenvalues and , as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , lie between the experimental triplet and singlet excitation energies to an accuracy of four significant digits , provided that relativistic and finite nuclear mass effects are taken into account .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath2 transition for ionized lithium .",
    "the first - order excitation energies obtained from standard perturbation theory are on average less accurate than the zeroth - order energies . in contrast , the excitation energies to first - order in the coupling - constant are on average better than the zeroth - order energies but the improvement is not consistently present for all the excitations . with the exception of the @xmath46 to @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 excitations for beryllium , the singlet - triplet splittings , obtained from either first - order scheme , are too large .",
    "note that for the two - electron systems , as shown in appendix  [ a1 ] , eqs .",
    "[ de1 t ] and  [ de1s ] yield a symmetrical splitting around the zeroth - order excitation energy .    from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , it is clear that the theoretical predictions for the higher excitation energies converge to the experimental excitation energies both in zeroth - order and in first - order coupling constant perturbation theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation energies from first - order standard perturbation theory converge to a too large value for helium and ionized lithium and a too low value for beryllium .",
    "it is apparent that the zeroth - order energies must converge to the experimental energies since the highest occupied kohn - sham eigenvalue is the negative of the ionization energy  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the ionization limit for each system has been indicated by an arrow .",
    "there is an explanation of why the higher excitation energies from first - order coupling constant perturbation theory converge to the experimental excitation energies  @xcite .",
    "coupling constant perturbation theory is based on the coupling constant hamiltonian in which the external potential is varied to keep the charge density constant for all values of the coupling constant @xmath1 . since the ionization energy is related to the asymptotic decay of the charge density , it is independent of the coupling constant .",
    "now , let us consider a perturbation expansion of the ionization energy and charge density in powers of the coupling constant",
    ". since the ionization energy and density are independent of the coupling constant , each term in the series , except the zeroth - order term , must be zero .",
    "if we perform perturbation theory to a finite order , the ionization energy is still strictly constant at each order : since the ionization energy is obtained as an energy difference , each order of perturbation theory contributes only to that same order .",
    "we note in passing that this is not true of the density . at a given order of perturbation theory , the density is correct only to that order since the @xmath50-th order wavefunction gives an @xmath51-th order contribution to the charge density that is canceled only by going to the @xmath51-th order of perturbation theory .",
    "finally , we note that the reason why the first - order energies in the standard perturbation theory are too high for helium and ionized lithium and too low for beryllium is that the correlation potential , @xmath52 , is mostly positive for the former and entirely negative for the latter  @xcite . as explained in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , the first - order excitation energies in standard perturbation theory differ from the energies to first - order in the coupling constant in having @xmath45 instead of only @xmath52 in eqs .  [ de1 t ] and  [ de1s ] .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] that the zeroth - order and first - order in coupling constant results are accurate not only close to the ionization limit but over most of the energy range .",
    "this calls for some further explanation beyond that provided above . in ref .",
    "@xcite the accuracy of the zeroth - order excitation energies is attributed to the additional fact that the kohn - sham orbitals and the quasi - particle amplitudes satisfy the same equation to order @xmath53 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the accuracy of the first - order excitation energies , obtained as differences of first - order total energies of the ground and excited states , does not extend to the individual total energies of the ground and excited states . from eq .",
    "[ h1 ] , we obtain for the ground state energy to first - order in the coupling constant : @xmath54 now , @xmath55 yields an energy that is a little worse than the energy from either the optimized effective potential ( oep ) method  @xcite or the hartree - fock method since the hartree - fock wavefunction is the best single - determinant wavefunction , while @xmath56 can be either negative or positive .",
    "for example , it is negative for beryllium but positive for helium , ionized lithium and neon .",
    "consequently , at least for some systems , the ground state energies obtained from the first - order formula are worse than those from hartree - fock and the typical errors in hartree - fock total energies is considerably larger than the errors we obtain for the perturbative excitation energies .",
    "we summarize the results in table  [ rms ] which shows the root mean square errors in the excitation energies for our three test systems in zeroth - order and first - order perturbation theory . for the perturbation in the coupling - constant ,",
    "the errors are reduced by about a factor of two for helium and beryllium and a factor of three for ionized lithium . for the standard perturbation theory ,",
    "the errors are about a factor of two worse than in zeroth - order for helium and beryllium while a slight improvement is obtained for ionized lithium .",
    "in addition to the excitations from the highest occupied level , that we have considered so far , we also studied the core - level excitation of beryllium from the 1s orbital to the 2p orbital , 1s@xmath57 2s@xmath57 @xmath37s @xmath58 1s@xmath37 2s@xmath57 2p@xmath37 @xmath37p .",
    "the experimental energy is 4.243 hartree  @xcite , while the zeroth - order perturbative energy is 4.017 hartree and the first - order perturbative energies for the @xmath59p and @xmath37p states are 4.440 and 4.460 hartree respectively .",
    "clearly , neither the zeroth- order nor the first - order energies agree with experiment as closely as do the energies of excitations from the highest occupied level .",
    "this is related to the fact that the eigenvalues of the occupied orbitals , other than the highest , are not strictly related to the corresponding ionization energies .",
    "just as mller - plesset perturbation theory is commonly used in quantum chemistry calculations , density functional functional perturbation theory could become a feasible technique to access excited states .",
    "however , the results presented above were obtained using the true kohn - sham potentials whereas practical implementations of the method would need to use potentials obtained from approximate exchange - correlation functionals . in fig  [ f2 ]",
    ", we compare the zeroth - order excitation energies obtained from the local density approximation ( lda ) and the optimized effective potential method with those obtained from the true kohn - sham potential .",
    "the lda does not bind any of the unoccupied orbitals in helium and binds only the lowest two unoccupied orbitals in beryllium .",
    "hence , the sparsity of lda data in fig  [ f2 ] . since the highest occupied level in lda is always too shallow , the zeroth - order lda excitation energies are on average too small .",
    "however , note that the lowest excitation energies of beryllium from all three potentials are very close .",
    "the reason is that this excitation is within the same principal quantum number shell ( @xmath60 ) and , consequently , both orbitals involved in the excitation explore the same , rather limited , spatial region .",
    "the oep excitation energies are too high for helium and ionized lithium and too low for beryllium , which of course is due to the correlation potential being predominantly positive for the former and negative for the latter  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , we present the same comparisons for the excitation energies obtained within first - order coupling - constant perturbation theory .",
    "the first - order oep and first - order exact kohn - sham energies split in a roughly symmetrical way about the corresponding zeroth - order values while the first - order lda energies have a large positive shift relative to the lda zeroth - order .",
    "the reason is the following . the second term in eqs .",
    "[ de1 t ] and  [ de1s ] , @xmath61 , is strictly zero for both the true kohn - sham potential  @xcite and for the oep potential  @xcite when @xmath29 is the highest occupied level . on the other hand",
    ", this identity does not hold for the lda exchange potential which is in fact considerably shallower than the true one , resulting in a large positive contribution from this term .",
    "note that all three quantities , @xmath29 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , depend on whether they are being calculated for the true kohn - sham theory , oep or lda but the main difference comes from the change in @xmath44 .",
    "we do not show gga results in figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] but we find that the existing gga s do not yield a large improvement upon the lda results .",
    "this is to be expected since the gga potentials also fail to have the correct asymptotic decay at large distances and are too shallow for much of the region where the charge density is appreciable .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in using time - dependent density functional theory ( tdft ) to calculate excitation energies . in performing these calculations",
    ", a choice has to be made for the static potential and for the dynamic response . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , we compare the tdft excitation energies of helium , obtained by petersilka , gossman and gross  @xcite using our exact kohn - sham potential and the dynamic response from oep , to our first - order coupling - constant perturbation theory results .",
    "the agreement is very close and on the scale of the plot the difference between the two theories can only be detected for the lowest two excitations . for two electron systems ,",
    "it is indeed possible to show that the tdft excitation energies obtained within the single - pole approximation , using the exact kohn - sham potential and the time - dependent oep kernel , are strictly identical to the excitation energies derived in first - order perturbation theory in the coupling constant ( eqs .",
    "[ de1 t ] and  [ de1s ] ) .",
    "the fact that , in this case , the single - pole approximation gives the leading correction to the kohn - sham eigenvalue differences  @xcite explains the close agreement found in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] .    as mentioned in the introduction , an older method for calculating excitation energies is the @xmath0scf method  @xcite .",
    "relative to perturbation theory , @xmath0scf has the advantage that , when using approximate functionals , it can be applied even when the corresponding approximate exchange - correlation potential does not bind any unoccupied orbital . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , we compare the excitation energies of beryllium from @xmath0scf , using the lda potential . the results obtained for beryllium are somewhat more accurate than those from perturbation theory using the lda or oep potentials but of course not as good as the perturbation theory results using the true kohn - sham potential . also for ionized lithium , we find that , although less accurate than the perturbation results with the exact kohn - sham solutions , the @xmath0scf energies are more accurate than the lda perturbative energies and of comparable accuracy to the perturbative oep results",
    ".    one can ask if it is possible to improve upon the perturbation theory results obtained with the exact exchange ( oep ) functional by adding an approximate correlation functional .",
    "unfortunately , the correlation potentials obtained from the lda and various gga correlation functionals bear no resemblance to the true correlation potential  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest  @xcite in orbital - dependent correlation functionals , the most popular one being the colle - salvetti functional  @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] , we also show the correlation energies obtained from adding the colle - salvetti correlation functional to the true exchange ( oep ) functional .",
    "the energies are improved for beryllium but are worse for helium and ionized lithium since the colle - salvetti correlation potential is mostly negative for all three systems whereas the true correlation potential is negative for beryllium but mostly positive for helium and ionized lithium .",
    "clearly , a present obstacle to the success of perturbation theory in the coupling constant seems to be the lack of an accurate approximation for the exchange - correlation functional . since approximate functionals such as the local density or generalized gradient approximations bind few ( if any ) unoccupied orbitals , combining an exact treatment of exchange with a local orbital - dependent correlation functional , better than the colle - salvetti functional , appears to be the most promising possibility in this direction .",

    "<S> we consider two perturbative schemes to calculate excitation energies , each employing the kohn - sham hamiltonian as the unperturbed system . using accurate exchange - correlation potentials generated from essentially exact densities and their exchange components determined by a recently proposed method , we evaluate energy differences between the ground state and excited states in first - order perturbation theory for the helium , ionized lithium and beryllium atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently observed that the zeroth - order excitations energies , simply given by the difference of the kohn - sham eigenvalues , almost always lie between the singlet and triplet experimental excitations energies , corrected for relativistic and finite nuclear mass effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order corrections provide about a factor of two improvement in one of the perturbative schemes but not in the other . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energies within perturbation theory are compared to the excitations obtained within @xmath0scf and time - dependent density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the excitation energies in perturbation theory using approximate functionals such as the local density approximation and the optimized effective potential method with and without the colle - salvetti correlation contribution . </S>"
