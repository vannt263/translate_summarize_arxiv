    "this is illustrated by simulation results in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which is for a magnetic field of 40  gauss and @xmath161 . as seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : eitres ] , for fixed @xmath48 the free parameters available to achieve the eit resonance condition on both the probe and the coupler transitions are the atom velocity @xmath46 in @xmath15-direction and the coupler detuning @xmath50 .",
    "the range of available velocity classes to satisfy the conditions follow from the maxwellian density distribution of thermal atoms , @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the root - mean - square atomic velocity in one dimension . here , @xmath164  m / s , @xmath165 denotes the total atomic volume density in the cell , and @xmath166 is the velocity - dependent volume density per m / s . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : eitres ] , the resonant velocities only depend on @xmath48 , which is zero in the simulation , and on the ground- and intermediate - level zeeman shifts ( notably not on @xmath50 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the a - transition is near - resonant for atoms with velocities @xmath167  m / s .",
    "this leads to optical pumping to near @xmath168 , as shown in the middle and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , as well as high photon scattering rates for atoms in this velocity class , as seen in the left panel in fig .",
    "similarly , the a-transition is near - resonant for atoms with velocities @xmath169  m / s , leading to optical pumping to near @xmath170 and high photon scattering rates for atoms in that velocity class .",
    "the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] further shows that atoms near those velocities account for most absorption , independent of @xmath50 .",
    "atoms with velocities between @xmath171  m / s and 48  m / s are optically pumped to some intermediate value of @xmath172 ; however , these atoms have low photon scattering rates , and they contribute little to the overall absorption behavior . also , in our magnetic - field range the resonant velocities are much smaller than the root - mean - square atomic velocity .",
    "therefore , the density reduction in @xmath166 due to the maxwell distribution is only on the order of @xmath173 and has no significant effect on the spectra .",
    "further inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows an asymmetry between positive and negative velocities , as well as in the degree to which the @xmath172-values approach the limits @xmath174 ( corresponding to perfect optical pumping into the aligned states , which have @xmath175 ) .",
    "the asymmetry is a result of the quadratic zeeman effect in the @xmath160 state .",
    "the levels @xmath176 are considerably more closely spaced than the levels @xmath177 ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "hence , the @xmath176 zeeman splittings in @xmath160 match the splittings of the @xmath178 in the ground state @xmath159 much more closely than the @xmath177 splittings in @xmath160 match the splittings of the @xmath179 in @xmath159 .",
    "this leads to higher photon scattering rates at @xmath180  m / s .    in the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we indicate the extremal values of @xmath172 . at coupler detunings away from the eit features , the @xmath172-values peak at -3.84 ( lower photon scattering , @xmath181  m / s ) and 3.48 ( higher photon scattering , @xmath182  m / s ) .",
    "it is therefore seen that higher scattering rates correspond with somewhat less efficient pumping . in the eit signals ,",
    "the less efficient optical pumping at @xmath182  m / s leads to quite pronounced satellite peaks b , c and d on the blue side of peak a , at @xmath183  mhz . from figures  [ fig1]-[fig4 ]",
    "it is evident that the peak a corresponds with @xmath184 , b corresponds with @xmath185 etc .",
    "hence , the incomplete optical pumping into @xmath184 causes the relatively strong b , c and d satellite peaks .",
    "conversely , the more efficient optical pumping at @xmath186  m / s into @xmath187 leads to less pronounced satellite peaks b and c on the red side of peak a , at @xmath188  mhz in the eit spectrum .",
    "it is further noteworthy that away from the eit resonances the coupler beam has very little effect on optical - pumping behavior .",
    "this reflects the fact that away from the eit resonances there is no velocity - detuning pair @xmath189 that satisfies a eit double - resonance for both coupler and probe fields .",
    "however , on the eit resonances the coupler inhibits probe - photon scattering , leading to substantial drops in photon scattering and optical - pumping efficiency .",
    "for instance , the eit peak labeled a reduces @xmath172 from about 3.48 to 3.16 , and the eit peak labeled a reduces @xmath190 from about 3.84 to 3.66 .",
    "the corresponding `` grooves '' in the photon - scattering and optical - pumping maps are clearly seen in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we have found the asymmetry trends in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as well as the back - action of eit onto optical pumping at other magnetic fields as well .",
    "the asymmetries in photon scattering and optical pumping , seen between positive and negative coupler detunings @xmath50 and velocities @xmath46 , are due to the nonlinear zeeman effect and generally increase with magnetic field .",
    "asymmetry already becomes evident at fields as small as about 5  gauss ; in lesser fields the nonlinear zeeman effect is so small that spectra , photon - scattering and optical - pumping maps are essentially symmetric in @xmath50 and @xmath46 .",
    "we have also observed asymmetry of rydberg eit spectra in a series of analogous experiments for polarization cases 852  @xmath191/ 510  @xmath192 and 852 @xmath192/ 510 @xmath191 .",
    "the experimental results and corresponding simulations are shown in top and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , respectively . when the magnetic field is only 5  gauss , the rydberg eit spectra are almost symmetric about @xmath50 because in fields that small there is no significant quadratic zeeman effect . in contrast , at 40  gauss the rydberg eit spectra for the two polarization cases in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are highly asymmetric , in a way that closely resembles the asymmetry seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] . especially , there are three clear satellite peaks , b , c and d , on the blue side of a , while there are no significant satellite peaks , b etc , on the red side of a. the increase in asymmetry at larger magnetic fields reflects the increasing importance of the quadratic zeeman effect in those fields .    it is also noted that the quadratic zeeman effect brings about an asymmetry in overall background absorption . at 5",
    "gauss the absorption away from the eit peaks is almost the same for @xmath191- and @xmath192-polarized probe fields , while at 40  gauss the @xmath86-polarized probe is considerably more absorbed than the @xmath97-polarized probe .",
    "note the corresponding difference in the number of scattered photons in the simulations ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . another interesting observation in the 40-gauss data in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the clear appearance of the `` type - ii''-peaks . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the `` type - ii''-transitions , shown by dashed green arrows , have much lower rabi frequencies than the dominant `` type - i''-transitions ( solid green arrows ) .",
    "the difference in rabi frequencies is caused by different degrees of electron - spin overlap between the intermediate and the rydberg states .",
    "since the rydberg state is in the deep hyperfine paschen - back regime , the frequency shift between corresponding type - i and type - ii lines is @xmath193  mhz / gauss , corresponding to 112  mhz in the right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( see horizontal arrows ) .",
    "we have performed rydberg eit spectroscopy in a cesium room - temperature vapor cell when an axial magnetic field in the range between 0 and 50  gauss is applied .",
    "the rydberg eit spectra exhibit characteristic sets of peaks and satellite lines that become highly asymmetric , in fields as small as @xmath194  gauss .",
    "we have modeled the spectra using quantum monte carlo wave - function simulations .",
    "the asymmetries and other features in the eit spectra were found to be due to the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "the simulations also allowed us to obtain insight into the optical - pumping behavior in a magnetic field , when an eit coupler beam is present .",
    "the presented all - optical , eit - based spectroscopic method may enable future studies that involve a magnetic field , such as plasma physics and field diagnostics in magnetized spectroscopic cesium or rubidium cells .",
