    "the quantum state estimation(or say quantum tomograph)@xcite is the task of inferring the density operator @xmath1 of a quantum system by appropriate measurements . like a classical probability distribution",
    "it can not be measured on a single system , but can only be estimated on an ensemble sequence of identically prepared systems . since @xmath1 can be spectral decomposed as @xmath3 ,",
    "the estimation of @xmath1 can be divided into two parts : the estimation of the spectrum @xmath4 and the estimation of the eigenstates @xmath5 .",
    "if we do not mind damaging the state , we can take measurements on each copy of @xmath1 and the estimations are simple .",
    "however , if we want the estimations are nondestructive , then the question becomes challenging . instead of measuring each state individually , we need collective operations on all @xmath0 states simultaneously . for the spectrum ,",
    "keyl and werner@xcite proposed a scheme based on the irreducible representations of permutation group and showed that the young frame is a good estimation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is still unclear that what kind of mathematical structure can be used to estimate the eigenstates . in this paper",
    ", we focus on this problem and try to give a solution for the qubit systems .",
    "it is well known that a qubit system can be geometrically represented as a bloch sphere@xcite .",
    "suppose the spectrum decomposition of @xmath1 is @xmath6 , then the eigenstates @xmath7 are determined by the axis @xmath8 ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "to estimate @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we only need to know the orientation of the axis @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the axis @xmath8 is determined by the plane @xmath11 and the plane @xmath12 , so the estimation of @xmath7 reduces to estimate the orientation of the plane @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the following ,",
    "we will show that , for any plane which passes through the center point of the bloch sphere , there exists a corresponding subspace in the @xmath0-fold hilbert space .",
    "the projective measurement onto the subspace can distinguish whether @xmath1 lies in the plane or not . successively performing these measurements , we can scan the bloch sphere to locate the plane @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it will be shown that this measuring scheme scarcely disturb the state if @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "bloch sphere ]",
    "before giving the main results , we briefly introduce the strongly typical set@xcite which will be very useful for understanding our estimating method .",
    "we use the notation @xmath13 to denote a classical binary sequence @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the number of @xmath16 in @xmath13 . for a binary distribution @xmath17",
    ", the strongly typical set @xmath18 is defined as : @xmath19 when @xmath20 is small , @xmath18 is the collection of the sequences for which the number of @xmath16 is about @xmath21 , and the number of @xmath22 is about @xmath23 .",
    "now we explain how to estimate the plane @xmath11 .",
    "define a basis @xmath24 by : @xmath25 clearly , this basis is corresponding to a diameter of the circle @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 , then @xmath28 corresponds to the projection of @xmath1 onto the basis @xmath29 ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "+ construct a  yes / no \" measurement @xmath30 by @xmath31 perform this measurement on @xmath32 , then we get the result  yes \" with probability @xmath33 . + * proposition1 * _ for any @xmath34 and @xmath35 , when @xmath0 is sufficiently large , we have _ +   + ( 1-a ) _ if @xmath36 , then _ @xmath37 _ where @xmath38 is trace norm_. + ( 1-b ) _ if @xmath39 , then _ @xmath40 + ( 1-c ) _ _ let @xmath41 be the entanglement fidelity__@xcite _ of the measurement , then _ @xmath42 + @xmath43 is the center @xmath44 of the bloch sphere .",
    "because @xmath28 is the projection of @xmath1 onto the basis @xmath24 , the condition @xmath36 implies that @xmath1 lies in a thin layer which takes @xmath44 as center and is perpendicular to the basis @xmath29 and is @xmath20 thick(see fig.2(a ) ) .",
    "the proposition(1-a ) reveals that if @xmath1 lies in the layer , the measurement will almost always give the result ",
    "proposition(1-b ) reveals that if @xmath1 is outside the layer(see fig.2(b ) ) , the result will almost always be  no \" .",
    "so the measurement can distinguish whether @xmath1 lies in the thin layer or not .",
    "since the parameter @xmath20 can be as small as desired , the layer can be viwed as a plane .",
    "if the layer contains @xmath1 , the layer approximate to the plane @xmath11 ! furthermore , because @xmath45 can be arbitrary small , the measurement fidelity @xmath41 is arbitrarily close to 1 , which means that the measurement scarcely disturb @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , we can construct a sequence of measurements to find the plane @xmath11 .",
    "we begin with the measurement @xmath46 , if we get the result  yes \" , then @xmath11 is found ; if  no \" , perform the next measurement @xmath47 . if we get the result  yes \" , then the work is done ; if  no \" , perform the next measurement @xmath48 ; ...... as @xmath49 increases , the layer rotates about the @xmath50-axis and scans the whole bloch sphere gradually . repeat the above procedures until for some @xmath49 we get a  yes \" , then the orientation of @xmath11 is got .",
    "a problem of this estimation scheme is that the fidelity decreases with the increasing times of measurement .",
    "however , this problem can be overcome if @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "proposition(1-c ) tell us that for any @xmath20 and @xmath45 , there exist a positive number @xmath51 , if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 .",
    "suppose we need @xmath54 times of measurement to find @xmath11 and the whole fidelity is @xmath55",
    ". then we can reasonably assume that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a continuous increasing function on @xmath45 and @xmath54 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "for a given @xmath20 , @xmath54 is up to @xmath60 because the measurement interval is @xmath20 .",
    "we can choose @xmath61 such that @xmath62 , and choose @xmath0 such that @xmath63 .",
    "in this case , @xmath64 , so @xmath65 .",
    "in other word , when n is large enough , @xmath55 will be close to 1 .",
    "the plane @xmath12 can be estimated in the same way .",
    "we can define a basis @xmath66 as @xmath67 this basis corresponds to a diameter of the circle @xmath68 .",
    "+ construct a measurement @xmath69 by @xmath70 similarly , this measurement can tell us whether or not @xmath1 lies in the thin layer which is perpendicular to the basis @xmath66 , and such a measurement scarcely disturb @xmath32 . as @xmath71 increases , the layer rotates about the @xmath72-axis .",
    "thus a measuring sequence can be constructed to find @xmath12 .",
    "proving proposition1 is quite a mathematical work and we need some knowledge about the method of types@xcite which was developed by csiszar and korner",
    ". we still use @xmath13 to denote a binary sequence @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the number of @xmath16 in @xmath13 .",
    "the type @xmath73 of @xmath13 is the relative proportion of @xmath16 and @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath74 . the collection of sequences of type @xmath75 is called the type class of @xmath75 , denoted as @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is the number of elements in @xmath76 , then @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the shannon entropy function . +",
    "the strongly typical set @xmath18 can be stated as @xmath81 if we produce binary sequence according to the distribution @xmath82 , then @xmath18 is a high probability set , i.e. for any fixed @xmath34 and @xmath35 , when n is large enough , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the probability that @xmath13 occurs .",
    "this property reveals that if we produce binary sequences according to the distribution @xmath85 , then the sequences are practically always in @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we give a stronger lemma . +",

    ". let @xmath93 . given @xmath88",
    ", it can be verified that if @xmath94 , then @xmath95 . so @xmath96 .",
    "thus we have @xmath97 the second inequality follows from ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "now we can prove the proposition1 .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "let @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath43 can be decomposed as @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 first we prove ( 1-a ) .",
    "the condition @xmath36 is equivalent to @xmath102 . from lemma1 , we know that for the distribution @xmath103 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 so proposition(1-a ) is proven .",

    "the second equality holds because for any sequence @xmath13 with type @xmath75 , the number of 0 is @xmath111 and the number of 1 is @xmath112 .",
    "the inequality is due to ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",

    "the proof of ( 1-c ) is very simple .",
    "according to@xcite , for any quantum operation @xmath124 , the entanglement fidelity @xmath125 .",
