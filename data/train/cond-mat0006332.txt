    "melting of crystals has always been an exciting subject in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the lindemann criterion allows to estimate the melting temperature in a simple way .",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for the melting is still debated .",
    "it was widely admitted that the melting in three dimensions ( 3d ) occurs when one of the phonon modes is softened by the temperature @xmath0 so that instability of the crystalline phase takes place leading to the liquid phase . in 2d , this scenario is not valid .",
    "mermin @xcite has shown in 1968 that long - range crystalline order is destroyed by @xmath0 if the elastic interaction is power - law - decayed with distance .",
    "nelson and halperin@xcite have shown that the 2d melting is due to defects , analogous to the case of kosterlitz - thouless transition for xy spins in 2d @xcite .",
    "inspired by this defect - mediated melting , several workers have attempted to prove that in 3d the melting may be also due to dislocations and defects @xcite . the soft - mode scenario , though theoretically possible , is not the one frequently observed in numerical calculations .",
    "works on defect theory up to 1989 have been summarized and developed in the book by kleinert@xcite .",
    "recently , several numerical investigations@xcite and analytic approximations@xcite have shown that dislocations and defects are responsible for melting .",
    "in particular , burakowsky , prestoni and silbar @xcite have shown that melting properties of most of elements of the periodic table can be explained by excitations of linear dislocations in the crystal using a polymer theory .",
    "katsnelson and trefilov @xcite have also recently developed a route toward a melting theory based in defects .",
    "they have emphasized the concept of the geometrical frustration @xcite , i. e. the 3d euclidean space can not be filled by the closest packing structure , the tetrahedral one .",
    "therefore they proposed that superdense regions and voids around them are to be formed near melting by thermal activation .",
    "these regions were suggested to be the precursor of the destruction of the crystalline order .    in this paper , we investigate by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation the melting of a 3d crystal where atoms interact with each other via the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential .",
    "we show that defects which occur in the solid phase when the transition temperature is approached from below are responsible for the melting .",
    "section ii is devoted to a description of our model and mc method .",
    "results are shown in section iii .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we consider a crystal of face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure which is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath1 where the interaction between atoms at @xmath2 and @xmath3 is described by the potential @xmath4 . for simplicity , the distance dependence is supposed to be given by the lj potential @xmath5 $ ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 being a characteristic length of the system chosen in such a way that the nn distance in the fcc lattice is equal to @xmath8 when only nn interactions are taken into account .",
    "the fcc lattice constant is therefore equal to 1 in the ground state .",
    "different potentials for cohesive interactions are envisageable , for example the so - called gupta many - body potential@xcite which has been recently used to study the melting process of a fcc crystal@xcite .",
    "we have shown that defects created near melting play an important role in the melting mechanism . in the present paper",
    "we would like to clarify how defects are topologically distributed and how they destroy the crystal order .",
    "to this end , we choose the lj potential which is simpler for implementing a volume - variable algorithm as will be described below .",
    "however , most of the conclusions concerning the melting mechanism are similar for these two potentials . details of a precise comparison will be given elsewhere .",
    "in this work , we studied a fcc lattice with different system sizes , using periodic boundary conditions , at constant pressure .",
    "interactions up to a cutoff distance @xmath9 have been taken into account .",
    "this is about the fourth - nearest - neighbor distance in the perfect fcc crystal .",
    "the following algorithm was used .",
    "starting from the solid state where atoms are on the fcc lattice sites , we heat the system up to a temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we equilibrate the system first locally at constant volume and then globally at variable volume , as explained hereafter .",
    "the local equilibration at constant volume is done as follows : we take an atom and move it to a nearby random position . this position is accepted if it lowers the atom energy .",
    "otherwise it is accepted with a probability according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we repeat this for all atoms : we say we achieve one mc step / atom .",
    "next , we change the system volume by a random amount : all atom positions are thus rescaled with the volume variation .",
    "we recalculate the energy and accept or reject this new volume using a constant pressure metropolis algorithm . for a general method ,",
    "see ref .. in the following we work at zero pressure .",
    "we find that the equilibrium is reached very fast with alternately 10 consecutive local mc steps / atom followed by one volume variation step , and so forth . in all , we performed about @xmath10 mc sweepings at each @xmath0 .",
    "physical quantities such as averaged internal energy per atom @xmath11 and radial distribution function @xmath12 are averaged over the next @xmath10 mc steps / atom .    from the plot of @xmath13 versus @xmath0",
    ", we can identify the transition temperature from solid to liquid state .",
    "furthermore , to investigate the melting mechanism we have computed the following quantities : angular distribution of neighbors , distribution of defects , number of nearest - neighbors ( nn ) etc .",
    "as we discuss below , due to the particular fcc structure we can not use the voronoi method which would give confusing results if care is not taken .",
    "let us show first in fig .",
    "1(a ) @xmath11 versus @xmath0 . one observes a discontinuity of @xmath11 indicating clearly that the transition is of first - order as expected for a 3d melting .",
    "this is confirmed by the jump of the average fcc lattice constant shown in fig .",
    "these figures show results for three different system sizes .",
    "since the transition is of first order , the transition temperature @xmath14 can not be defined with precision ( due to hysteresis ) .",
    "moreover for sizes greater than 500 particles the melting temperatures fall within the same interval .",
    "therefore , in the following we will show results for the system of n=1372 particles .",
    "we take @xmath14 as the lower limit of the transition temperature region . from fig . 1",
    ", we take @xmath15 .",
    "note that as our simulation cell does not contains surfaces , this transition temperature , corresponds to the metastability limit of the crystal s ability to superheat rather than to the thermodynamical melting point @xcite . in the following , we will call for simplicity , t@xmath16 at this transition temperature and associate the phenomena with an apparent melting point since the structure loss all local order at this temperature .    fig .",
    "2 shows the radial distribution function between atoms at a low @xmath0 ( @xmath17 ) in the solid phase .",
    "the first ( second , third , ... ) peak corresponds to the nn ( nnn , third neighbors , ... ) distance of the fcc structure .    to calculate the coordination number @xmath18 of a site",
    ", we integrate the radial distribution function up to the first minimum .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "2 , integrating @xmath12 over @xmath19 up to about @xmath20 ( first minimum ) will give @xmath21 .",
    "integrating @xmath12 from @xmath22 up to the next minimum at @xmath23 gives @xmath24 and so on .",
    "these coordination numbers verify the fcc structure .",
    "we use this method instead of the frequently used voronoi construction because the voronoi polyhedra in a slightly distorted fcc structure have small faces and short edges and the coordination number could not be precisely calculated because these small faces appear and disappear frequently due to thermal excitations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to complete our structure determination , we also calculate @xmath25 , the angular distribution of neighbors around a site within a plane up to a certain distance .",
    "the function @xmath25 gives the probability to have two neighbors of an atom forming an angle @xmath26 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 an example of angular distribution taken at @xmath17 .",
    "the peak at 60 ( 90 , 120 ) degrees corresponds to the angular distribution of the nn ( nnn , 3rd nn ) atoms in the fcc structure .",
    "let us increase @xmath0 near the transition .",
    "the radial distribution @xmath12 at @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . the main differences with the low @xmath0 structure shown in fig .",
    "2 are :    * all the minima between the peaks are raised .",
    "this is evidence that the crystal order is reduced at @xmath27 . in particular",
    ", the minimum between the first and second peaks does not correspond to @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that a diffusional dynamics is activated near melting .",
    "this is the origin of the formation of defect clusters we will discuss below . *",
    "another feature is the strong reduction of the second and fourth peaks .",
    "the cubic symmetry is therefore weakened and the remaining correlated part of the system is within the ( 111 ) planes .    integrating @xmath12 over @xmath19 between two consecutive minima ,",
    "one obtains the coordination number @xmath21 only at @xmath29 of the total crystal sites .",
    "@xmath30 of the sites have 11 nn , @xmath31 have 13 nn and @xmath32 have 10 nn . at this stage , it is worthwhile to stress that though the temperature is still below @xmath14 , such an important percentage of sites ( @xmath33)exhibit defects . the crystal structure can not be therefore considered as a defect - free one which is used in the search for a phonon soft - mode responsible for the elasticity instability at the melting .    the angular distribution for @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "one observes a strong deviation from the low-@xmath0 one shown in fig .",
    "the cubic symmetry is reduced and the persistence of the ( 111 ) structure is seen in this figure : the peak at 90 degrees characteristic of the cubic symmetry is broadened and reduced whereas the other two peaks of the ( 111 ) one still have some structure .    for @xmath34 ,",
    "i.e. a temperature just above the transition , we find the following striking result : @xmath35 of sites with 11 nn , @xmath36 with 10 nn , @xmath37 with 12 nn , @xmath38 with 9 nn , @xmath39 with 8 nn , @xmath40 with 13 nn , @xmath41 with 7 nn and with 14 nn .",
    "note that the percentage of 12-nn atoms has dropped from @xmath29 at @xmath27 to @xmath37 at this temperature .",
    "the average nn number is therefore 10.71 .",
    "let us analyze now the structure of the observed defects .",
    "for this purpose we calculated the radial and angular distributions _ between defects _ as follows : whenever we are at a defect , i.e. atom with a coordination number different from 12 , we search for defects around it up to a certain distance and realize histograms .",
    "figure 6 shows the radial distribution of defects at @xmath27 around defects with @xmath42 .",
    "one observes that i ) the defects are surrounded by other defects at a distance ( 0.696 ) slightly shorter than the equilibrium nn distance indicating that at this temperature defects form clusters ii)there is a larger number of defects at a distance 0.876 very close to @xmath43 , indicating that defects occupy the sites at the middle of the fcc cube which are normally vacant in the equilibrium configuration .",
    "this finding is important since it shows that defects forms clusters with two shells : the inner are defects at 0.696 and the outer at 0.876 from the center defect .",
    "at this temperature , this kind of defects are uncorrelated at larger distance ( see fig .",
    "the situation for defects with @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "7 . in this case",
    "the second peak is less intensive and order at larger distance appear as we discuss below .",
    "angular distributions between defects at @xmath27 shows a shift of a few degrees of the peaks toward smaller angles for defects with @xmath42 as expected for @xmath18 larger than 12 ( see fig .",
    "however for defects with @xmath44 , only the first peak is lowered , while the other two peaks are shifted a few degrees higher .",
    "let us analyze more carefully the distribution of the clusters formed by the defects .",
    "we have computed the number of defects _ inside _ each cluster . as we previously stated",
    "we have seen that defects are not isolated but they are arranged in separated inner and outer groups within a defect cluster .",
    "the outer groups appear and dissapear while the simulation evolves , making the cluster size vary . to quantify the sizes of these clusters we have obtained a histogram representing the probability to have a cluster with a given number of particles .",
    "the results are plotted in figs .",
    "9 at low , intermediate and near the melting point temperatures . at low temperature [ fig .",
    "9(a ) ] , where the density of defects is very low , they appear mainly in pairs .",
    "these pairs of defects are completely isolated and not important for the thermodynamical properties . as the temperature increases , larger clusters of defects start to be created [ fig .",
    "9(b ) ] . note that at temperatures near melting , clusters of all sizes are present with the same probability up to a large given number of particles [ fig .",
    "9(c ) ] . when the cluster size reaches a given critical value the system melts .",
    "we can interpret these defect clusters as a set of dislocation arrays or alternatively as liquid zones inside a solid bulk . to enforce this interpretation",
    "we show the radial distribution between defects in fig .",
    "10 for defects with @xmath42 at @xmath34 .",
    "one observes a large double peak indicating defects at distances between nn and nnn equilibrium distances and pronounced peaks at around 3rd neighbor distance ( @xmath45 ) and at 2 .",
    "this suggests that defects are linked over large distances near the transition .",
    "note that this correlation is in fact insinuated below @xmath14 as is seen in fig . 7 for defects of c=11 at t=0.7 .",
    "the scenario proposed by burakowsky , prestoni and silbar @xcite is somewhat verified .",
    "we recall that this theory states that melting appears as a result of dislocation generation .",
    "when the density of the dislocation array reach a given critical value , the entropy of these arrays compensates the increase of energy produced by the local breakdown of the perfect crystalline order .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our results were obtained with simulations using a combination of local and volume updates .",
    "however the use of only collective updates with variable volume as in our previous work@xcite does not alter our conclusion though the equilibrating time is somewhat longer .",
    "we have studied the melting mechanism of a fcc solid with the lj potential .",
    "the results show that defects created in the solid phase become numerous enough to cause the crystal to melt . at the transition , about one fourth of the total sites do not have the coordination number 12 of the perfect structure . just above the transition , only about 20@xmath46 have 12 nn .",
    "our analysis of the structure of defects shows that a defect is surrounded by atoms at @xmath19 about @xmath47 ( nn distance ) and by atoms at @xmath19 about @xmath43 which is not the nnn distance ( = 1 ) of the perfect structure .",
    "a closer examination shows that these atoms are themselves defects created by dislocating atoms to somewhere between nn and nnn distances .",
    "these dislocated positions correspond to bridge positions in the potential landscape .",
    "we note that statistics taken between defects shown above indicate that defects are linked together at the transition . in other words ,",
    "the assumption of linear defects by burakowsky , prestoni and silbar@xcite is somewhat verified here . by linear defects",
    ", one should understand strings of defects which are not necessarily straight lines of defects . of course , other aspects of their theory should be further checked .",
    "but this is out of the scope of the present work ."
