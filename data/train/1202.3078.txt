    "the compositions of stars provide a test for models of galactic chemical evolution , with the general assumption being that the photospheric chemical composition of most stars represents the local galactic chemical composition where they formed .",
    "van den bergh @xcite and schmidt @xcite first noted that the ratio of low - metallicity g dwarfs to solar - metallicity g dwarfs in the local neighbourhood is too small to be explained by the ` simple model ' of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the simple model , as summarized by tinsley @xcite , is a model assuming ( 1 ) the solar neighbourhood can be modeled as a closed system ; ( 2 ) it started as 100% metal - free gas ; ( 3 ) the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) is constant ; and ( 4 ) the gas is chemically homogeneous at all times .",
    "each of the assumptions in the simple model are demonstrably false , but it is an important starting point for the development of more complex models .",
    "the process of solving the g dwarf problem and explaining the galaxy s chemical enrichment history has been underway for nearly five decades . the solution will require discarding one or more the simple model s assumptions .",
    "the introduction of a variable imf ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    ".    the g dwarf problem does not apply only to the local neighbourhood : the g dwarf problem exists in other galaxies as well @xcite .",
    "while g dwarf lifetimes would suggest that some g dwarfs may have left the main sequence during the galaxy s lifetime , the paucity of low - metallicity stars locally also extends to the longer - lived k dwarfs @xcite .",
    "mould @xcite suggested that there may be an m dwarf problem : using spectra of six m dwarfs and infrared spectroscopy of sixteen old disc m dwarfs , he estimated the abundance dispersion for m dwarfs and found evidence that suggested a common chemical history of g and m dwarfs .",
    "we have directly tested the existence of an m dwarf problem by estimating the metallicity of 4141 m dwarf stars with temperatures in the range where our analysis method is valid , @xmath1 , using cah and tio molecular band strengths measured from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra @xcite and find that there is an m dwarf problem in the galactic disc similar to the previously known g and k dwarf problems .",
    "this does not suggest a new solution to the m , k , and g dwarf problems , but rather shows that for all stars with main sequence lifetimes comparable or larger than the age of the galaxy , and where chemical abundance surveys have been performed , the number of low - metallicity stars is insufficient to match the simple model .",
    "m dwarfs are inherently faint objects , and therefore must be nearby to appear bright enough to obtain high - resolution spectra , @xmath2 , of sufficient quality to measure atomic absorption lines for abundance analyses , while using a reasonable amount of telescope time .    molecular band indices cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 @xcite measured from low - resolution spectra , @xmath3 , have been shown to be useful in classifying cool dwarfs .",
    "cah2 and cah3 correlate well with spectral type and the combination of cah2 or cah3 with tio5 separates cool dwarfs into rough metallicity classes : dwarfs , subdwarfs , and extreme subdwarfs @xcite .",
    "woolf , lpine , & wallerstein @xcite used metallicities of 88 m dwarfs , estimated using atomic lines measured from high - resolution spectra @xcite , to develop and calibrate a method to use cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 molecular band indices to estimate m dwarf metallicities more precisely .",

    "based on the maximum errors the empirical data appear to allow , as opposed to standard statistical errors based on repeated measurements of the same quantity .",
    "most errors should be less than half of those maxima .",
    "we used cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 indices measured from sdss spectra to estimate metallicities for the 4141 m dwarfs in our sample .",
    "the stars were placed in 0.1 dex [ fe / h ] bins from @xmath121.5 to 0.1 .",
    "this extrapolates slightly beyond the limits for which our method was calibrated .",
    "the number of stars in bins with [ fe / h ] less than @xmath120.50 is very small , so extrapolating to [ fe / h ] = @xmath121.55 at the low metallicity end makes little difference .",
    "the number of stars in the @xmath0 \\approx + 0.1 $ ] bin is less certain because the entire bin is outside our calibration , but the bin is included to show that , if our calibration continues to be correct a little beyond where testing stopped because of a lack of stars for the calculation , it appears that the trend in number of stars versus metallicity drops for @xmath0 > 0 $ ] .",
    "our spectroscopic sample contains 4141 low - mass stars selected from the sdss @xcite munn ` special plates , ' which were made public as part of the sdss data release 4 @xcite .",
    "the munn plates were targeted to be a magnitude - limited sample of m and late - k dwarfs with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and be located near the @xmath15 , @xmath16 galactic sight line .",
    "this sample was previously used to study the kinematics of the local milky way thin and thick discs @xcite to roughly 2 kpc above the galactic plane and are contained in the larger sdss m dwarf spectroscopic samples @xcite .",
    "we analysed the 8859 spectra that were observed using the hammer spectral typing facility @xcite and rejected stars that had poor quality ( snr @xmath17 3 near h@xmath18 ) and spectral types earlier than k5 ( resulting in 7714 stars ) .",
    "as part of our analysis , we computed radial velocities ( rv ) by cross - correlating each spectrum with the appropriate @xcite m dwarf template . in the case of k5 and k7 dwarfs",
    ", we used the m0 template for our rv determinations .",
    "the computed velocities were used to correct the stellar spectra to zero radial velocity .",
    "we then computed the tio5 , cah2 and cah3 molecular band indices @xcite from the velocity - corrected spectra .",
    "additional stars were removed from the sample if their molecular band indices , temperature , or [ fe / h ] fell outside the range covered by the woolf et al .",
    "@xcite metallicity calibration , leaving the 4141 stars for our study .",
    "all stars with temperature and [ fe / h ] within the metallicity calibration have @xmath19 colours larger the 0.2 value used in the initial selection , so the colour limit should introduce no selection effects for our metallicity statistics .",
    "low metallicity main sequence stars ( subdwarfs ) are less luminous than higher metallicity stars with the same temperature or spectral type @xcite . because the sdss m dwarf sample was selected to fall within a magnitude range , the subdwarf m stars must be closer on average than the higher metallicity stars , and thus sample a smaller volume of our galactic neighbourhood .",
    "we must correct for this to avoid introducing a malmquist bias - like effect and overcounting the number of more luminous stars .",
    "we used stars from @xcite for which parallax data were available and thus absolute magnitudes could be calculated to find the luminosity variation with metallicity for m dwarfs in our temperature range .",
    "an absolute magnitude difference function was found by fitting a three dimensional ` surface ' to the [ fe / h ] , cah2@xmath22cah3 , and @xmath23 data points calculated for the stars .",
    "cah2@xmath22cah3 acts as a temperature proxy in the calculated fit .",
    "we found that for the best - fitting surface , the magnitude change with metallicity did not depend on cah2@xmath22cah3 ( temperature ) within the range of our metallicity calibration .",
    "for example , two 3500 k stars with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and -1.0 differ in magnitude by the same amount as two 4000 k stars with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and -1.0 .",
    "the fit to the data points is @xmath24 } + c\\rm{[fe / h]}^2 + d(\\rm{cah2 + cah3 } ) \\\\   + e(\\rm{cah2 + cah3})^2 , \\nonumber % \\end{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the root mean squared deviation between the absolute v magnitudes calculated using parallax and apparent v magnitudes and those calculated using the above formula is 0.450 .",
    "the @xmath23 values calculated from equation [ eq : eq2 ] , @xmath23 ( model ) , are compared to those calculated from observed @xmath20 magnitudes and trignometric paralax , @xmath23 ( observed ) , in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "we did a similar fit using the absolute r magnitudes and found coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , with the root mean squared deviation between the @xmath35 values calculated from paralax and r measurements and from the formula being 0.485 .    because there is no temperature dependence in the difference in magnitude ( or luminosity ) for m dwarfs of the same temperature but with different metallicities",
    "there is also no temperature dependence in the volume correction due to metallicity .",
    "we can apply the same volume sampling correction for all stars in our sample without considering temperature .",
    "the magnitude - limited volume sampled for each metallicity bin is proportional to the distance cubed .",
    "the distance to a star is proportional to the square root of its luminosity for a given apparent magnitude .",
    "so for a given stellar luminosity , l , the sampled volume is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "subdwarfs with smaller luminosities are sampled from a smaller volume , so we multiply the numbers of stars in the metallicity bins by the inverse of the volume factor , @xmath37 , to correct for the volume difference . the @xmath20 and @xmath21 luminosity and absolute magnitude differences and the volume correction factor for different [ fe / h ] values as calculated using @xcite stars are shown in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the sdss stars in our sample were selected for observation using an sdss @xmath38 magnitude cutoff .",
    "we must therefore use @xmath39 , the difference in @xmath38 absolute magnitude caused by varying metallicity , in our volume correction .",
    "none of the stars used for our volume correction due to metallicity differences have sdss photometry available , so they can not be used to calculate @xmath39 directly .",
    "instead , we first use @xmath40 and @xmath41 to estimate @xmath42 , the difference in sdss @xmath43 magnitude due to metallicity differences .",
    "we then use @xmath44 , the difference in @xmath45 colour due to metallicity differences , to calculate @xmath39 to use for our volume correction .    the sdss @xmath43 photometric band overlaps the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands .",
    "differences in metallicity should therefore cause differences in @xmath43 absolute magnitude similar to the differences found for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the corrections for @xmath20 and @xmath21 differ at most by 0.06 magnitudes . assuming that @xmath42 is equal to the mean of @xmath40 and @xmath41 should therefore introduce errors smaller than a few percent .",
    "we have therefore estimated the necessary corrections using updated synthetic spectra ( hauschildt , private communication ) based on phoenix calculations @xcite , finding the mean differences in @xmath46 colours in the spectra relative to the [ fe / h ] = 0.0 spectrum for temperatures between 3500 k and 4000 k. we then calculated the difference in @xmath38 magnitude due to metallicity differences : @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath38 luminosity ratio and volume corrections were calculated in the manner described previously for @xmath20 and @xmath21 and are reported in table [ t1 ] .    an alternate method to calculate @xmath44",
    "would use a published empirical colour - temperature calibration to estimage @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 colours for stars of m dwarf temperatures then use an existing empirically - derived formula to transform these to an @xmath45 colour .",
    "@xcite provide such a colour - temperature calibration .",
    "the m dwarf metallicities used in their calibration are based on kinematics , with young disc stars assigned @xmath0 = -0.1 $ ] , old disc stars @xmath51 , and halo stars @xmath52 , unless the star is in a cluster , in which case the cluster metallicity was used .",
    "if we use their empirical calibration rather than the colours from synthetic spectra , we find much smaller corrections for @xmath44 .",
    "for example , the @xmath45 correction for @xmath0 = -1.5 $ ] stars is @xmath53 if calculated from synthetic spectra , but is about 0.02 if calculated from the empirical calibration data .",
    "our goal is to compare the trend for m dwarf stars with a model which has predicted more low - metallicity stars than have been observed .",
    "we will therefore avoid the possibility of under - counting low - metallicity stars by using the larger correction based on synthetic spectra which tends to increase the corrected number of low - metallicity stars . in the end , because the number of observed stars drops off so quickly with decreasing metallicity , our conclusions do not depend on which of these corrections we use . we correct by multiplying the number of stars in each metallicity bin by the values in the @xmath54 column in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the empirically - based difference between @xmath40 and @xmath39 is very small , so if someone prefers not to use the correction based on synthetic spectra , one can multiply by the value in the @xmath55 column instead .",
    "we note that the sdss sample has both a faint @xmath38 magnitude limit and a bright @xmath38 magnitude limit , meaning that the volumes sampled are effectivly spherical shells .",
    "the ratio of the distances to the faint magnitude cutoff is the same as the ratio of the distances to the bright magnitude cutoff however , so the volume ratio of the unsampled inner spheres is the same as the volume ratio of the spheres defined by the faint limit : no additional correction is required to account for the bright magnitude cutoff .",
    "the observational direction for our sdss m dwarf sample , near @xmath15 , @xmath16 , means that the more distant stars in the sample are farther from the plane of the galactic disc and thus in a region with a lower stellar number density . without correcting for this effect we would overestimate the fraction of fainter , low - metallicity subdwarf stars which are found in a denser region of the disc .",
    "we use the difference in distances due to metallicity and a model of the milky way stellar number density distribution to correct for this effect .",
    "@xcite report absolute @xmath43 magnitudes , @xmath56 , for m dwarfs based on photometric parallax .",
    "figure  2 from their paper plots @xmath56 vs spectral type . from this figure",
    "we find that the typical @xmath56 for stars in our data set , mostly m0 to m2 dwarfs , is about 9.0 .",
    "this is consistent with the absolute magnitude of the few warmer m dwarfs with reported sdss photometry and trigonometric parallax @xcite .",
    "a @xmath57 star with @xmath58 , the mean observed @xmath43 magnitude for our sample , is at a distance @xmath59 pc .",
    "@xcite report the stellar number density distribution for the milky way , providing an exponential equation to calculate estimates of changes in density with radial distance from galactic centre and perpendicular distance from the plane of the disc ( juric et al . equation 23 ) .",
    "stellar number density variation due to differences in radial distance from galactic centre is minimal for our stars , given the direction and distance to the sample .",
    "we assume the radial terms from the juric et al .",
    "equation are constant and recognize that @xmath60 is above the plane of the galaxy and the direction to the stars in our sample places them below the plane .",
    "the equation thus becomes @xmath61 ) , where c is the stellar number density at the vertical centre of the disc at the solar radial distance , @xmath60 is the solar distance above the galactic plane , @xmath62 is the distance to the star measured in the direction perpendicular below the plane , and @xmath63 is the scale height for the disc , thin or thick .",
    "note that this form of the equation is not valid for stars above the plane or closer to the centre of the plane than the sun .",
    "we use this modified equation to find the ratio of the stellar number density @xmath64 for a star in our sample with a distance @xmath62 compared to the local density @xmath65 : @xmath66 @xcite report @xmath67 pc for the thin disc , @xmath68 pc for the thick disc , and @xmath69 pc .    to make a rough correction for differences in stellar number density caused by metallicity we first use @xmath42 from table [ t1 ] to find the luminosity ratio relative to a [ fe / h ] = 0 star for each metallicity bin : @xmath70 .",
    "the ratio of the distances for stars with the same apparent magnitude is then @xmath71 .",
    "if we then assume that the mean distance to a [ fe / h ] = 0 star in our sample is 501 pc we can use the distance ratio to find the mean distance to stars in the other metallicity bins . because @xmath72 for our sample , the distance perpendicular to the galactic plane is @xmath73 .",
    "we calculate the ratio of the stellar number density at the typical perpendicular distance , @xmath62 , for stars in each metallicity bin relative to the local solar neighborhood density using equation [ eq : density ] .",
    "we calculate the ratio for both thin disc stars , @xmath74 , and thick disc stars , @xmath75 , and use these and the local 12% thick disc fraction @xcite to calculate the density ratio @xmath76 . for each metallicity bin",
    "we divide this density ratio @xmath77 by the value found for the [ fe / h ] = 0 bin to get @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the stellar number density at the typical distance to solar metallicity stars in our sample . to correct for differences in stellar number density",
    "we multiply the number of stars in each metallicity bin by the inverse of this density ratio , @xmath80 , as reported in table [ t1 ] .",
    "we note that the volume correction and the stellar number density correction act in opposite directions : fainter , lower metallicity stars are sampled in a smaller volume , but in a region with a higher density of stars .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     other studies have found that the number of stars peaks at a metallicity centred in the range @xmath81 \\la 0.0 $ ] for g and k dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the peak for m dwarfs is at the high end of this range and note that our peak is more narrow than that typically found .",
    "there has been some `` narrowing '' of the reported metallicity distribution over time since the first reports of the g dwarf problem in the 1960 s , probably as a result of a reduction of the uncertainties as the methods for calculating elemental abundances have improved .",
    "our results for m dwarfs most closely match those found by favata et al .",
    "@xcite for k dwarfs , however . in their study of g and k dwarfs",
    ", they separated stars into two groups with effective temperatures hotter and cooler than 5100 k and found very different metallicity distributions .",
    "they did not report mean and standard deviations for their corrected distributions , but we estimate from the values on their plots that the warmer stars showed a distribution similar to those previously reported for g dwarfs , centred at @xmath82 \\approx -0.28 $ ] with @xmath83 , and that the cooler star distribution dropped off more sharply toward lower metallicities and was more sharply peaked with a centre at @xmath82 \\approx -0.03 $ ] and @xmath84 .",
    "luck & heiter @xcite , report elemental abundances for stars within 15 pc .",

    "it appears that the trend of higher mean metallicity and narrower peaks seen for the metallicity distributions for cooler stars seen in the favata et al .",
    "and luck & heiter data applies to the even cooler m dwarfs in our sample .",
    "` simple ' models of galactic chemical evolution produce higher numbers of long - lived low metallicity stars than we find for m dwarfs and others have found for g and k dwarfs .",

    "the smooth dotted curve in figure [ f2 ] is derived from the cumulative distribution described by equation [ eq : tinsley ] , given that the increase in the cumulative distribution must be caused by stars in each successive metallicity bin .",

    "galactic chemical evolution models normally include a region about 1 kpc wide in the galactic plane and about 1 kpc perpendicular to the plane to include stars that formed in the thin disc but which now leave the local neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "the sdss magnitude limits mean that our sample reaches out to about 2 kpc @xcite and that no nearby m dwarfs are included .",
    "the part of the survey which includes our m dwarf spectra is centred near the southern galactic cap @xcite .",
    "much of the sampled region is more distant than the thin disc scale height , so we expect a larger fraction of thick disc stars to be included in the sample than would be found locally .",
    "including a larger fraction of stars outside the thin disc would presumably mean including more low - metallicity stars than would be found in a sample from the local neighbourhood .",

    "<S> we present evidence that there is an m dwarf problem similar to the previously identified g dwarf and k dwarf problems : the number of low - metallicity m dwarfs is not sufficient to match simple closed - box models of local galactic chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the metallicity of 4141 m dwarf stars with spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) using a molecular band strength versus metallicity calibration developed using high resolution spectra of nearby m dwarfs . using a sample of m dwarfs with measured magnitudes , parallaxes , and metallicities , we derived a relation that describes the absolute magnitude variation as a function of metallicity . </S>",
