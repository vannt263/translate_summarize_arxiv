    "<S> we report the synthesis of mno@xmath0 microspheres using hydrothermal and conventional chemical reaction methods . </S>",
    "<S> the microspheres of mno@xmath0 consist of nanowires having a diameter of 20 - 50 nm and a length of 2 - 8 @xmath1 m. the value of the oxygen vacancy @xmath2 estimated from the x - ray photoelectron spectrum ( xps ) is  0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization versus temperature curve indicates a magnetic transition at about 13 k. it is found that a parasitic ferromagnetic component is imposed on the antiferromagnetic structure of mno@xmath0 , which might result from distortion of the lattice structure due to oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic transition temperature t@xmath3 is about 10 k lower than that of the bulk mno@xmath4 single crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 61.46 + w , 75.75 + a , 75.50 -y 81.07 -b    the possibility of controlling the structure and the chemical composition of materials at the nanoscale level is of great interest for both basic science and technological applications . in particular , one dimensional(1-d ) nanometric structures of oxides have attracted intensive attention@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example mno@xmath4 has distinctive properties which have enabled its use as catalysts , ion - sieves , and electrode materials@xcite . both @xmath5- and @xmath6- mno@xmath4 are poential candidates for cathodes and catalysts in li / mno@xmath4 batteries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can be converted into li@xmath7mn@xmath4o@xmath8 cathode by electrochemical li@xmath9 intercalation , in which li@xmath9 was inserted or extracted during the charging or discharge process . </S>",
    "<S> mno@xmath4 nanowires are of great interest due to that their morphology simultaneously minimize the distance over which li@xmath9 must diffuse during the discharge and charging processes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may provide the opportunity to determine the theoretical operating limits of a lithium battery as the 1-d nanowire is the smallest structure for the efficient electron transport . </S>",
    "<S> mno@xmath4 nanowires or nanostructure materials also contain much highly surface area which may become more ideal host materials for the insertion and extraction of lithium ions and chemical reactions . therefore , well defined 1-d nanostructures appear as a much better candidate for studies on the space - confined transport phenomena as well as applications . </S>",
    "<S> considerable effort has been made to prepare bulky or nanocrystalline mno@xmath4 with different structures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , single crystal mno@xmath4 nanowires have been synthesized using a hydrothermal method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mno@xmath4 also possesses an interesting magnetic structure@xcite . up to now , very few investigations on the magnetic properties of nano - sized mn - oxides have been reported . in this letter , we report the synthesis of microspheres of mno@xmath0 consisting of nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the microspheres were prepared using both hydrothermal and room temperature chemical reaction methods . </S>",
    "<S> the structure , morphology , composition and magnetic properties of the mn - oxide microspheres were studied using x - ray diffraction(xrd ) , scanning electron microscopy(sem ) , transmission electron microscopy(tem ) , magnetic measurements and x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy(xps ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the materials synthesized here were prepared by oxidation of hydrated manganese sulfate mnso@xmath8.h@xmath4o with an equal amount of ammonium persulfate ( nh@xmath8)@xmath4s@xmath4o@xmath10@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mnso@xmath8.h@xmath4o ( 0.08mol ) and ( nh@xmath8)@xmath4s@xmath4o@xmath10 ( 0.08 mol ) were dissolved in 150 ml distilled water at room temperature to form a clear solution . </S>",
    "<S> half of the solution was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave , sealed and maintained at 120 @xmath11 for 12 h. another half of the solution was kept at room temperature in air for 6 h. after the reaction , the resulting black solid from each solution was filtered and washed with distilled water and acetone several times , then dried at 60 @xmath11c for 24 h. x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using cu-@xmath12 radiation shows the material to be single phase , @xmath5-mno@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization curves of the samples were measured using a squid magnetometer in a field of up to 6 t from 1.5 k to 300 k. the morphology was studied using sem(jeol-6340f ) and tem . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray photoelectron spectra were collected using a `` kratos '' model axis 165 xps spectrometer with a mg source and an al monochrometer .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the x - ray diffraction patterns of the samples obtained by both methods . </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction peaks can be indexed to @xmath5-mno@xmath4 with lattice parameters a=9.784@xmath13 and c=2.863@xmath13 , space group i4/m . </S>",
    "<S> the xrd pattern of the room temperature treated sample(fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) shows much broader , and less intensive peaks , due to its smaller grain size and the many crystal defects . </S>",
    "<S> there are some changes in the relative peak intensities in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , suggesting a preferred orientation among the mn - oxide grains . </S>",
    "<S> the mean size of the particles ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) is about 40 nm as determined by the scherrer formula using the width of the [ 211 ] peak from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( a ) , and was further confirmed by sem and tem imaging(fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) .    fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the sem((a)-(d ) ) and tem(e ) images of the samples prepared by the two methods . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and ( b ) show a sea urchin - like sphere with a diameter of 4 - 8 @xmath1 m for the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method . </S>",
    "<S> these microspheres consist of bundles of small wires with a diameter of 20 - 50 nm(see tem image ( e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures 2(c ) and ( d ) show the typical morphology of the mno@xmath4 obtained by the reaction carried out at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the diameter of these microspheres varies from 1 to 4 @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> the microspheres are also made up of smaller needle - like wires , however , they are not so sharply defined as compared to the samples made by the hydrothermal method . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrothermal treatment increases the diameter of the microspheres and the length of the nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the concentration of the solution is very important in forming the microspheres . </S>",
    "<S> the microspheres can be synthesized when the mn@xmath14 concentration is higher than 0.3 mol / l . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that , at high mn@xmath14 concentrations , the formation of microspheres by aggregation of the nanowires is favored by a decrease in the total surface energy of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical room temperature x - ray photoelectron spectrum of the mn@xmath0 prepared by the hydrothermal method is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . the peaks of mn ( 3s , 3p , 2p , 2s ) and o ( 1s , 2s ) are observed . </S>",
    "<S> auger peaks from mn and o are also observed as o kll and mn lmm lines . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energies of the mn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states are 641.5 and 653.6 ev , respectively , which are lower than those of the standard mno@xmath4(642.1 and 653.8 ev ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in binding energy is likely due to the oxygen vacancies formed in these materials which would decrease the mn - o bond strength . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated relative ratio of mn to o is 37:63 corresponding to a composition of about mno@xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows the zero field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling(fc ) magnetization curves of mn@xmath0 prepared by the hydrothermal method measured under different magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> a kink is observed at about 13 k in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( a ) and ( b ) , corresponding to the nel magnetic transition temperature t@xmath3 . this temperature is lower than that of a mno@xmath4 single crystal @xcite t@xmath3=24.5 k , which is due to the small grain size effect@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kink as well as the difference between the zfc and fc curves becomes smaller as the applied magnetic field increases . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( a ) shows the zfc and fc curves of the sample prepared at room temperature . a similar phenomenon is observed , except that the transition peaks are much broader and the magnetization value is higher which may be due to more defects and a larger distortion in this sample . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 is the magnetization versus applied magnetic field curves of the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method . at 1.8 k </S>",
    "<S> , the m - h curve shows a small hysteresis , which indicates that a ferromagnetic component is superposed on the antiferromagnetic curve . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the m - t curves in that the magnetization increases with decreasing temperature suggesting a ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic structure is formed in this compound . at 300 k , </S>",
    "<S> nearly linear m - h curves reveal that a paramagnetic state exists in this temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic component at low temperature may result from the noncollinear molecular field that cants the two antiparallel sublattices due to the distortion of the crystal structure , especially arising from the oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the small canted angle between the moments of the mn sublattices leads to a small ferromagnetic moment@xcite . </S>"
