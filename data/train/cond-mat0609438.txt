    "the numerical investigation of strongly correlated fermion systems on a lattice is a fundamental goal of modern condensed matter physics .",

    "exact diagonalization , on the other hand , is only possible for a small number of sites because of the exponential growth of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "a useful and numerically feasible approach to treat fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit is the so - called dynamical mean field theory .",
    "development of this field started with the demonstration by mller - hartmann and by metzner and vollhardt @xcite that the diagrammatics of lattice models of interacting fermions simplifies dramatically in an appropriately chosen infinite dimensional ( or infinite coordination ) limit .",
    "this insight was developed by georges , kotliar and co - workers @xcite who showed that if the momentum dependence of the electronic self - energy may be neglected ( @xmath0 ) , as occurs in the infinite coordination number limit , then the solution of the lattice model may be obtained from the solution of a quantum impurity model plus a self - consistency condition .",
    "quantum impurity models are amenable to numerical study .",
    "a well - established method is the hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite , which employs a discrete hubbard - stratonovich transformation to decouple four - fermion terms .",
    "the method however requires the discretization of imaginary time into equal slices , which restricts it to relatively high temperatures .",
    "further , analysis of the `` slater - kanamori '' interactions relevant to partially filled d - orbitals requires a very large number of hubbard - stratonovich fields @xcite .",
    "this further complicates the simulations .",
    "recently , a new class of continuous - time impurity solvers has been developed @xcite .",
    "these diagrammatic qmc approaches rely on an expansion of the partition function into diagrams and the resummation of diagrams into determinants . a local update monte carlo procedure",
    "is then used to sample these determinants stochastically .",
    "two complementary approaches have been formulated : the weak coupling method @xcite uses a perturbation expansion in the interaction part , while the hybridization expansion method @xcite treats the local interactions exactly and expands in the impurity - bath hybridization . in the weak - coupling case , the determinantal formulation , which eliminates or at least greatly alleviates the sign problem , originates from wick s theorem . in the hybridization expansion , when starting from a hamiltonian formulation , the determinants emerge naturally from the trace over the bath states @xcite .",

    "the matsubara green function is required for the computation of the self - energy and the hilbert transform , so measuring the green functions directly in frequency space allows one to avoid the fourier transformation from imaginary time to matsubara frequencies . in the weak coupling algorithm",

    "for @xmath89 near 0 or @xmath55 , the green function converges rapidly , whereas the variance of these measurement values is relatively large for @xmath90 .",
    "the number of imaginary time slices does not influence the performance of the algorithm , and thus can be chosen arbitrarily large .",

    "similar to the weak coupling case , formula ( [ strongmeas ] ) could be fourier transformed and @xmath91 measured directly . however",
    ", this approach is not advantageous , because the computation of the exponentials is very expensive compared to the rest of the simulation , and the binned values can easily be computed on a fine grid . since the measured values are in any case not a small correction to a known function , the hybridization expansion algorithm has more difficulties obtaining accurate results for the high - frequency behavior .    as noted in ref .",

    "we estimate that similar modifications in the code for the hybridization expansion algorithm would provide a speed - up of at least a factor of 10 .",

    "this is the question which is relevant to people interested in implementing either of the methods and avoids the tricky ( if not impossible ) task of separating the different factors which contribute to the uncertainty in the measured results . because the variance of the observables measured in successive iterations of the self - consistency loop turned out to be considerably larger than the statistical error bars in each step , we determined the mean values and error bars using 20 dmft iterations starting from a converged solution .",

    "this noise is the consequence of the statistical errors in the green function and can hence be reduced by running the simulation for a longer time ( see fig .",
    "[ selfenergy_tau_omega.fig ] ) . however , fig .",
    "[ selfenergy_tau_omega_rubtsovwerner.fig ] also shows that even for the shorter runs , the data remain accurate up to sufficiently large @xmath140 that a smooth patching onto the analytically known high - frequency tail appears feasible .",
    "furthermore , since the hybridization expansion results in this section have all been obtained without any patching or smoothing and nicely agree with those from the weak - coupling solver , it seems that this uncertainty in the high - frequency tail is not a serious issue .",
    "+      we have tested both continuous time algorithms away from half filling , in a region where the half - filled model at zero temperature has a gap ( @xmath147 ) and in a region without gap ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) .",
    "a comparison of the green functions and self - energies has shown that both algorithms produce the same result within numerical precision and are much faster than hirsch - fye .",
    "both continuous time algorithms have no sign problem away from half filling ( @xcite , @xcite ) and again the time needed to obtain a given accuracy is mostly determined by the size of the matrix . in the case of the weak coupling algorithm it decreases continuously away from half filling , while in the case of the hybridization expansion the perturbation order first increases with doping if the half - filled model has a gap , and then decreases ( see fig .  [ matrix_size_u2_beta30.fig ] ) .",
    "for all regions of parameter space tested , the hybridization expansion approach yields the smaller matrix sizes and is therefore substantially faster .",
    "the matrix sizes become comparable only in the limit of filled or empty bands .    for the hybridization expansion algorithm ,",
    "we have also computed the matrix size for @xmath150 and much lower temperatures @xmath151 , 200 and 400 .",
    "these results showed that the perturbation order for a given filling remains proportional to @xmath55 , so that the shape of the curve remains the same as shown for @xmath152 in fig .",
    "[ matrix_size_u2_beta30.fig ] . in particular",
    "this means that the formation of the  kondo resonance \" ( which contains the physics of coherent low energy quasi - particles ) in the slightly doped system at low temperatures does not lead to any dramatic change in the perturbation order .",
    "we compared the performance of three different impurity solvers : the hirsch - fye auxiliary field approach which for the last 15 years has been widely used in dmft calculations , and two recently developed continuous - time algorithms , which are based on a stochastic sampling of an expansion of the partition function in the interaction and hybridization , respectively .",
    "both continuous - time methods were found to be much more efficient than hirsch - fye for all relevant values of temperature , interaction strength and filling .",
    "because the time - discretization in hirsch - fye simulations furthermore introduces a systematic error which can be substantial and is difficult to estimate without a careful analysis involving several runs for different @xmath108 , it makes sense ( in most cases ) to replace the method by one of the continuous - time solvers .",
    "the hybridization expansion leads to much smaller matrix sizes at intermediate and strong couplings , than the weak - coupling expansion .",
    "hence it allows access to much lower temperatures .",
    "our analysis has shown that the hybridization expansion is particularly powerful at calculating low - frequency components of the green function and quantities which are sensitive to these components , such as the quasi - particle weight .",
    "the method has more difficulties capturing the high - frequency behavior correctly . in the weak - coupling approach ,",
    "the algorithm perturbs around the non - interacting solution , which has the correct high - frequency tail and if the green function is measured directly in frequency space , the intermediate and high matsubara frequencies can be determined very accurately .",
    "its power has also been demonstrated with recent applications to the kondo lattice , multi orbital models @xcite , and cdmft @xcite .",
    "we do not expect the noise in the high frequency components to be a serious problem , because the noise appears at high enough frequencies that a smooth patching onto the analytically known tail seems feasible .",
    "however , the application of the hybridization expansion algorithm to a model with arbitrary density of states will be an important test .",
    "efforts to use it in the simulation of vanadium oxide are under way and results will be presented elsewhere .",
