    "the question of which physical processes produce the holes observed in the 21 cm line in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of many galaxies such as in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( kim et al 1999 ) , holmberg ii ( ho ii , ddo 50 , ugc 4305 ) ( puche et al . 1992 ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1997 , stanimirovi et al . 1999 ) and the western magellanic bridge ( muller et al . 2003 ) has been a controversial and puzzling issue in the past . on the observational side ,",
    "there are evidences that many of the shell and void - like structures observed in the ism of different galaxies , especially in the outer parts of their galactic disks are unlikely to be the result of supernova explosions .",
    "kim et al . ( 1999 ) came to this conclusion for the lmc in view of the weak correlation that exists between the positions of some of the shells and the regions . using a multicolor bvr imaging approach , a careful study by rhode et al .",
    "( 1999 ) of the 51 holes in ho ii , previously selected by puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , shows no signs of the presence of remnant stellar clusters inside 86 percent of these holes . additionally , using h@xmath2 photometry",
    ", they could not confirm the presence of any ongoing star formation process inside the holes .",
    "based on these observations , they concluded that those holes can not be supernova driven expanding shells . furthermore , stewart et al .",
    "( 2000 ) observed the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) emission of ho ii .",
    "the fuv emission is sensitive to massive star formation on a timescale which is comparable to the lifetime of the largest holes in ho ii ( @xmath3 100 myrs ) .",
    "only 3 out of the 51 holes selected by puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have associated fuv emission whereas in the rest of the holes the emission is concentrated at their edges .",
    "furthermore , only very little fuv emission is detected outside the 2@xmath4 - 3@xmath4 radii inner region , indicating that star formation has played only a little role in the outer region .",
    "x - ray observations of ho ii using rosat pspc by zezas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kerp et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that most of the holes are devoid from hot gas",
    ". however , kerp et al . ( 2002 ) showed that a few x - ray sources ( sources 2 and 4 in fig . 1 in their article ) ,",
    "located outside the stellar disk but within the distribution of ho ii have emission that might be associated with thermal plasma radiation which is characteristic of supernova remnants .",
    "this suggests that , the supernova scenario can not be entirely ruled out in the case of those few holes .",
    "alternative mechanisms which could lead to the creation of the holes in ho ii have been discussed by several authors ( rhode et al .",
    "1999 ; bureau & carignan 2002 ) .",
    "some of the proposed scenarios are related to the supernova scenario , like invoking a non standard initial mass function and modifying the holes energetics which helps to reduce the number of supernovae needed to create them .",
    "the latter scenario was pointed out by rhode et al .",
    "it would however require a reduction of the supernova rate by a factor of @xmath5 in order to have a remnant stellar cluster with a luminosity that falls below their detection limit .",
    "this in turn would require that the expansion velocities in the case of the largest holes have been overestimated by a factor @xmath6 by puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which seems unlikely .",
    "the scenario of an extremely top - heavy imf in ho ii is also not supported by any observations of significant variations in the imf measured in different environments like the milky way or other nearby galaxies ( leitherer 1999 ) and thus , seems also very unlikely .",
    "holes could also be created by the impact of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) on the gaseous disk . in the case of the milky way and other galaxies",
    ", it has been shown that some holes are associated with high velocity gas ( heiles 1984 for the milky way ; van der hulst & sancisi 1988 for m101 ) . in the case of ho",
    "ii , only one object has been identified by rhode et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as a possible hvc .",
    "this object has an estimated mass of 1.2@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath9 and a total kinetic energy of @xmath10 ergs .",
    "this amount of energy is enough to create any of the observed holes in ho ii .",
    "aside from being statistically not very significant , this cloud has been detected on only one pixel in the whole data set . as already pointed out by rhode et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the signal detected from that pixel could also be assimilated to noise under the assumption that the noise in the data set is gaussian . only a more sensitive study of the structure around ho ii can shed more light on the existence and role of hvcs .",
    "by re - processing the low resolution map of puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , bureau & carignan ( 2002 ) have unveiled the large scale structure of the in ho ii to be comet - like .",
    "they interpret this as gas in ho ii experiencing ram - pressure stripping under the effect of the intra - group medium ( igm ) and that this process might lead to the formation of some holes or to the enlargement of existing ones .",
    "this scenario would only work if the igm density is @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "bureau & carignan ( 2002 ) pointed out to the fact that tidal interactions on the scale of the subgroup of galaxies containing ho ii , kar 52 and ugc 4483 could also affect the morphology of ho ii .",
    "however , a preliminary analysis of the structure on the subgroup scale by bureau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) does not support the scenario of gas being tidally stripped from the disk of ho ii in the direction of kar 52 and vice versa .",
    "it is also inconclusive with regard to the role played by ram pressure stripping .    in this work",
    ", we investigate whether the morphology could also emerge as the result of internal gas dynamics as earlier suggested by elmegreen ( 1997 ) .",
    "our aim is to explore the role played by turbulence and by thermal ( field 1965 ; field et al .",
    "1969 ) and gravitational instabilities ( kolesnik 1991 ) ( ti and gi , respectively ) on the formation of large scale structure in the ism .",
    "we use three dimensional hydrodynamical isothermal simulations of driven turbulence to investigate if holes like those in ho ii are formed as a natural consequence of the turbulence present in the medium .",
    "we then study the effect of heating and cooling and take the self - gravity of the gas into account . in a post - process approach ,",
    "we build two dimensional emission maps in the 21 cm hyperfine structure line and compare them to observations .",
    "ti has been traditionally considered as an important agent of structure formation in the ism .",
    "burkert & lin ( 2000 ) performed a linear perturbation analysis of ti and studied numerically under which condition the transition from the linear to the non - linear regime occurs .",
    "snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , used high resolution 1d simulations to study the behavior of ti in the presence of forced flows .",
    "koyama & inutsuka ( 2000 , 2002 ) have investigated with 1d and 2d simulations which include detailed cooling , heating and chemistry , the propagation of shocks in the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the development of ti in the post - shock region .",
    "kritsuk & norman ( 2002a , b ) showed , using three dimensional simulations , that a time fluctuating background heating supports turbulence in a multiphase ism .",
    "piontek & ostriker ( 2004 ) investigated the interplay between ti and the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 2001 ) .",
    "vzquez - semadeni et al . ( 2000 ) and gazol et al . (",
    "2001 ) used local two dimensional numerical simulations to investigate ti in the ism on a scale similar to ours ( 1 kpc ) .",
    "they focused on the segregation of the medium into two distinct gaseous phases .",
    "a major success of their model is that they were able to reproduce a mass fraction of the unstable gas which is in good agreement with the observations ( heiles 2001 ) , but they did not build emission maps that can be compared with observations .",
    "wada & norman ( 1999 , 2001 ) and wada et al . ( 2000 ) have shown that the combined effect of ti and gi with turbulence can lead to the formation of holes .",
    "they performed global two dimensional numerical simulations of an lmc type galactic disk and constructed from their hydrodynamical data emission maps in the 21 cm and the co(1 - 0 ) lines .",
    "they transformed their two dimensional grid into a three dimensional one by assuming a constant scale height for the disk , divided in a number of grid cells . though they used a rather sophisticated approach to solve the radiation equation in each of the newly created cells , the local densities in all cells along a given line of sight",
    "were assumed to be the same , which is a major simplification . additionally ,",
    "although a similarity in the complex network of holes and shells is observed between their simulated map and observations of the structure in the 21 cm line of the lmc , they did not quantify the hole and shell - like structures .",
    "this contrasts with our simulations which take into account the complexity of the three dimensional structure , which arises self - consistently .",
    "the holes formation process by ti and gi in the ism of dwarf irregular galaxies is critically reviewed by snchez - salcedo ( 2001 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our set of simulations .",
    "the radiative transfer approach we use to construct the emission maps is described in  3 . in ",
    "4 we define the observable quantity which we use to compare our models with observations . in ",
    "5 we present the observational data and in  6 we evaluate the autocorrelation length in our simulated maps and compare it with the observations . in  7 , we summarize our results .",
    "we use the zeus-3d code ( stone and norman 1992a , b ) to solve the equations ( mass , momentum and internal energy conservation ) of ideal gas dynamics .",
    "in addition , we solve the poisson equation to account for the self - gravity of the gas in some of the simulations .",
    "the poisson equation is solved using a fft - solver following an algorithm by burkert & bodenheimer ( 1993 ) which is derived from press et al .",
    "the grid represents a 1 kpc@xmath13 volume of the ism , and the calculations are performed with a resolution of 128@xmath13 grid cells .",
    "a polytropic equation of state with a specific heat ratio of 1 is used in isothermal simulations and 1.4 in simulations including cooling and heating .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in all three directions .",
    "the medium is originally uniform in density with an average density @xmath14 @xmath12 , which is the typical value for the warm interstellar medium .",
    "we first performed a number of isothermal simulations ( runs isoimj in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) in which the turbulence is driven on different length scales and with different mach numbers ( i indicates the driving wave number and j the mach number ) .",
    "the initial density fluctuations for the isothermal runs are generated following the description given in klessen ( 1998 ) and klessen & burkert ( 2000 ) .",
    "the density fluctuations are described by a power spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath16 , which implies that the energy is distributed equally on all scales . we should however mention that since the medium is constantly driven , its evolution is rather independent of the initial conditions .",
    "we mimick the turbulence driving by compensating for the energy lost through dissipation by injecting random motions to the gas such that the total injected energy is equal to the energy - dissipation rate following the description of mac low ( 1999 ) . with this prescription ,",
    "the medium is driven at a certain scale which is defined by a certain characteristic wave number @xmath17 ( i.e. , characteristic driving scale @xmath18 ) .",
    "the medium is evolved over two dynamical timescales .",
    "the dynamical timescale is defined as the ratio of the box size @xmath19 to the initial _ rms _ turbulent velocity @xmath20 years , where @xmath19=1 kpc and @xmath21 km sec@xmath22 .",
    "the value of 10 km s@xmath22 has been chosen as being a typical value of the warm phase in the ism . in these isothermal simulations ,",
    "the medium reaches a dynamical equilibrium ( stationary probability distribution functions , pdfs , of the density , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) after @xmath3 one dynamical timescale with the largest over - densities being of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "the density and velocity distributions inherited after evolving the medium for one dynamical timescale in the isothermal regime ( with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) are used as initial conditions for simulations including cooling and heating ( runs co0jgi in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "g stands for runs where self - gravity is included ( t otherwise ) , j describes the cooling efficiency ( see below ) and i the above mentioned wave number value .",
    "the simulations are evolved for two dynamical times after heating and cooling are turned on .",
    "the timestep that is used to evolve the internal energy is the cfl timestep which means that the energy net losses / gains are assumed to affect implicitely the determination of the timestep at each iteration . in our simulations , this can be justified by the fact that the largest changes in the internal energy in a given cell do not exceed a few percents of the initial available energy reservoir .",
    "a similar approach has been adopted by several authors who have used the zeus code in astrophysical problems that involve cooling and heating of the gas ( e.g. , pavlovski et al .",
    "2002 ; smith et al .",
    "an initial _ rms _ mach number of 1 is reasonable given the observed velocities of a few km s@xmath22 with temperatures of a few 1000 k. the initial density distribution for the simulations with cooling is inhomogeneous with ( @xmath26 and temperature is set initially everywhere to @xmath27 k. we assume the cooling and heating terms in the energy equation to be , respectively , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the later term is responsible for keeping a non - zero fraction of the gas in the intermediate temperature regime by heating up the envelopes of dense clouds and restoring cold gas to the diffuse phase .",
    "the temperature is allowed to vary between @xmath30 k and @xmath31 k. we set @xmath32 mimicking the density squared dependence in the cooling function describing radiative cooling ( spitzer 1972 ) and @xmath33 , thus mimicking a constant background heating .",
    "we use a simple prescription to account for the self - shielding of the clouds by nulling the heating term in the inner cells of a cloud and applying a shape dependent linear heating at the boundary cells of the cloud .",
    "this introduces a shielding density , @xmath34 above which the shielding of the clouds becomes effective .",
    "an inner cell is defined as a cell where all of its 26 neighoring cells have a density which is higher then the shielding density .",
    "a surface cell is defined as a cell where the number of neighboring cells with density larger than @xmath34 is greater than zero and less then 26 and the amount of heat it receives is proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of cells in the surrounding of the considered cell which have a density lower than @xmath34 .    in this paper , we shall analyze a number of models for which the combination of free parameters leads to ti , with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean particle density of the gas .",
    "this choice of parameters leads to ti where the thermal - equilibrium pressure decreases when density increases , and this for the whole temperature range ( see eq . 9 in vzquez - semadeni",
    "however , with the imposed upper and lower temperature limits , gas can be forced to be in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. , cold gas at the minimum temperature @xmath41 is not allowed to cool below @xmath41 if its cooling rate is larger than its heating rate ; the same arguments applies for warm gas which gets trapped at @xmath42 .",
    "we vary the cooling rate @xmath43 in the different simulations .",
    "the cooling rate is inversely proportional to the cooling timescale @xmath44 ( dib et al .",
    "2004 ) which can be parameterized as a fraction @xmath45 of the dynamical time : @xmath46 .",
    "dib et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have run a large number of simulations similar to those presented in this paper , but for decaying turbulence . in those simulations",
    "the mass fractions of cold ( @xmath47 k ) and intermediate ( @xmath48 k ) are checked after they have reached equilibrium ( or pseudo - equilibrium ) values .",
    "they found that ti always takes place for values of @xmath49 ( see .",
    "fig 1 . in their paper ) . for @xmath45 @xmath50 (",
    "corresponding to small values of @xmath43 ) the kinetic energy is dissipated before ti comes into play and no significant over - densities can be produced . on the other hand , for very small values of @xmath45 ( large @xmath43 ) the available reservoir of thermal energy",
    "is radiated extremely fast and the medium achieves everywhere its minimum temperature .",
    "the simulation then resembles an isothermal simulation with a @xmath51 mach number close to unity .",
    "snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discussed the development of ti in 1d numerical simulations as a function of the parameter @xmath45 in the presence of forced flows .",
    "they show that ti always takes place when @xmath49 regardless of the forcing strength . in our simulations involving cooling ,",
    "the driving occurs on large scales and @xmath45 is smaller than one , thus enabling the development of ti .",
    "the turbulent medium initially fulfills everywhere the jeans stability criterion . after cooling",
    "is turned on , the gas cools preferentially inside the high - density fluctuations which become even more dense due to the large induced pressure gradients ( particularly in the case of the smaller values of @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , perturbations evolve in a highly dynamical way .",
    "the first significant over - densities ( a factor of a few 100 ) are produced by means of ti .",
    "condensations disappear either under the effect of localized turbulence , merge to form denser and larger condenations , or eventually the effect of background heating which affects mostly their outer boundaries . in the case of a weak cooling ( large value of @xmath45 ) , the condensations that form do not reach the stage of gravitational collapse , but they continue to cool and condense in order to achieve a pseudo - pressure equilibrium with the warmer phase . in the models where ti is efficient ( small value of @xmath45 ) , some of the most massive clumps become gravitationally bound and begin to contract under the effect of gravity , leading to even denser structures with central densities of a few 10@xmath13@xmath12 . in a later stage , condensations start merging and form larger condensations which ultimately will end up into a unique dense object . in order to understand the separate effects of ti and gi ,",
    "we have performed a simulation with @xmath52 but without self - gravity ( e.g. , model co03t2 ) .",
    "this simulation evolves in a similar way to model co03g2 until the point where condensations with central densities of a few 100 @xmath12 are formed , but these condensations do not merge together and the medium is segregated into two phases coexisting under rough pressure equilibrium conditions .",
    "the time evolution of the pdfs in simulations co03t2 and co03g2 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively , illustrates the difference between the two models and the role played by gravity .",
    "whereas the medium in model co03t2 settles in a pseudo - stationary bimodal distribution , the pdf of model co03g2 shows an increasingly moving tail towards higher densities as dense strcutures accrete additional matter under the effect of gravity .",
    "the implications on how these different behaviors could be interpreted from observations will be detailed in section 6 . fig .",

    ", the peak density has already reached a value of @xmath55 @xmath12 .",
    "the detailed structure in the three dimensional space can not be compared directly to observations .",
    "rather , observations of large scale structures of the ism are presented as emission maps in different atomic or molecular lines .",
    "the relatively low average density of our simulated medium ( 0.5 @xmath12 ) will not show up in emission maps of the high density tracers such as co , cs and n@xmath56h@xmath57 and despite the fact that we have some detectable emission in the co(1 - 0 ) line , the number of cells where this signal can be registered is very small . to make a direct comparison with observations possible",

    "we choose @xmath117 to be the value of the length scale when @xmath114=0.2 .",
    "the autocorrelation length is then defined as the average of the three autocorrelation length values derived from maps calculated for the three projections of the simulation box .",
    "houlahan & scalo ( 1990 ) pointed out that the estimate of @xmath114 on small scales might be affected by structures with characteristic scales that are larger than the box size .",
    "this indeed might happen for some of the smaller boxes , if a box with the smallest size we consider ( 125 pc ) is centered on a condensation which is larger than the box itself . in that case",
    "the estimate of @xmath117 might be dominated by the self terms and would not be accurate .",
    "however , on those small scales ( 125 pc ) , we calculate , at each time step , the value of @xmath117 @xmath119 times on independent sub - boxes and many of those sub - boxes are not centered on dense condensations which happen to be larger than them .",
    "so , due to the large statistics , we are confident that we pick up the signature of cross terms ( undoubtedly always affected by the self terms ) even on the smallest scales we consider . in order to confirm this statement , we have checked , at the smallest scale we consider ( i.e. , @xmath120 pc @xmath121 cells ) , what is the fraction of points that have @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath60 is the emissivity and i and j the indices in each direction .",

    ", we can evaluate what is the fraction of points that are part of a gradient on that scale .",
    "the closer to unity the fraction of points which fall in this category is , the lesser the probability that independant structure or substructure exists on that scale .",
    "we find , for directions @xmath124 and @xmath73 , respectively , the following fractions at @xmath53 : for @xmath52 0.49 and 0.44 , for @xmath125 0.54 and 0.55 and for @xmath126 the values of 0.64 and 0.58 .",

    "in order to check the validity of the comparison of @xmath117 on a particular scale between the observations and the synthetic maps , the dependence of @xmath117 on the size @xmath127 of the analyzed region must be checked in ho ii . for a given scale @xmath127 , we subdivide the observed map of ho ii in side by side boxes , each of size @xmath127 , excluding pixels within a distance @xmath127 from the edges of the map to avoid contamination by the outer pixels which might not belong to ho ii . for larger scales",
    "we additionally consider squared regions that are shifted by a third of the box size in order to increase the number of boxes on which we evaluate @xmath117 .",
    "the characteristic autocorrelation length at a given scale is calculated by averaging the individual values .",

    "the shape of the @xmath0 relation suggests that the structure is correlated for scales less than @xmath128 kpc . on larger scales , structures in different regions",
    "seem to form independently .",
    "the relationship between the position of the turnover point in the @xmath0 relation and the length scale of the driving mechanism as well as the value of the slope in the linear regime is what we attempt to explore in the next section using comparisons between the observed and simulated maps of ho ii . for the @xmath0 relation in ho ii , a linear fit to the data points for scales ranging between 0.25 kpc and 6 kpc yields a slope of @xmath129 ( i.e. , fit over - plotted to the data in fig .",

    "we first analyze the set of isothermal models in which the turbulence is driven at different length scales and at different mach numbers . these are labeled isoimj in table . 1 , where i stands for the wavenumber on which the energy is injected and j the mach number .",

    "larger then @xmath134 the @xmath0 relation nearly flattens .",
    "the turnover point in the @xmath0 relation seems to be associated with the scale of the driving mechanism .",
    "therefore , it can only show up if @xmath117 is calculated from small scales up to scales that are larger than @xmath134 .",
    "a comparison of the models and the observations at a given scale is meaningful , only if that scale lies below the turning point of the @xmath0 relation both in the models and the observations .",
    "a small increase in @xmath117 is still visible with increasing scale .",
    "this is probably due to the presence of a non zero upward energy cascade which distributes some of the injected energy on scales larger than @xmath134 . the direct comparison of fig .  [ fig8 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] implies that energy is injected into the ism of ho ii on a scale of the order of @xmath3 6 kpc .",

    "the kinetic energy power spectrum drawn by stanimirovi & lazarian ( 2001 ) for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) speaks for a large scale driver operating in the smc as well .",
    "the spectrum shows no signs of energy injection up to the largest scale they have considered ( 4 kpc ) .",
    "the linear regime below the turning point is governed by the energy decay of the turbulence from large to small scales .",
    "thus , the slope of the @xmath0 relation in that regime is an indication of the gas equation of state .",
    "a linear fit to the @xmath0 data for scales smaller or equal to @xmath134 in models iso2m1 and iso4m1 yields a slope of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "this is a factor @xmath137 smaller than the value yielded by the observations and is probably an indication that the hypothesis of isothermal gas is not entirely valid .",
    "we now check if these conclusions still hold when turbulence is driven at different @xmath138 mach numbers .",
    "we compare the observations to models iso2m05 , iso2m1 , iso2m2 , iso2m3 and iso2m5 where turbulence is driven with mach numbers of 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 , respectively . in these simulations turbulence",
    "is driven with a wave number @xmath24 ( @xmath139 kpc ) and thus , a comparison of these models to the observations is performed at the 0.5 kpc scale .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows that the autocorrelation length remains independent of the strength with which turbulence is driven .",
    "we now turn to more realistic models where the cooling and the heating of the gas are present , as well as self - gravity .",
    "we should mention that the purpose of this section is not to recover the precise structure of the gas in ho ii , but rather to show qualitatively the importance of the combined effects of turbulence and the gas thermodynamics in generating the observed structures .",
    "the models have the ratios of the cooling time to the dynamical time of @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( strong , intermediate and weak cooling ) . in these simulations turbulence",

    "the advantage of comparing the autocorrelation length on the 0.5 kpc scale is that a large number of independent 0.5 kpc@xmath142 squares can be selected from the map of ho ii ( we select @xmath143 0.5 kpc@xmath142 squares ) , thus enhancing the accuracy of the observed value at this scale . though the observed value is only an estimate of the characteristic autocorrelation length at the time of the observations and although the holes and shells are continuously interacting , the selected sample is large enough to consider the observed value at the @xmath144 kpc scale @xmath145 pc as a realistic stable value . due to the non - linear evolution of structures under cooling and gravity , a time average for the value of @xmath117 is not meaningful , as it could smear out the true behavior of the gas . in order to distinguish the effects of ti and gi on the large scale structure as it would appear in the map , we compare two models with the same cooling rate ( @xmath52 ) but with and without self - gravity ( models co03g2 and co03t2 , respectively ) .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows that the evolution of @xmath146 is nearly similar in both models until @xmath147 , despite the fact that in the case of the run with gravity , the condensations that form following the early condensation process by ti are a few order of magnitude denser than in the case without self - gravity .",
    "only when the larger and denser condensations start accreting the smaller ones , @xmath146 rises again .",

    "<S> we suggest that large holes observed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies such as the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and ( ho ii , ddo 50 , ugc 4305 ) can form as the combined result of turbulence coupled with thermal and gravitational instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this problem with three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations , taking into account cooling and heating processes and the action of the self - gravity of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an algorithm for radiative transfer to post - process the simulated data and build emission maps in the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line . with this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to reproduce the structure of the shells and holes as observed in regions of the ism , where no stellar activity is detected . in order to quantify the comparison of our synthetic maps to the observations </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the physical scale - autocorrelation length relation ( @xmath0 relation ) both on the synthetic maps and the map of ho ii . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 relation shows a linear increase of the autocorrelation length with the physical scale up to the scale of energy injection and flattens for larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the @xmath0 relation between the observations and the synthetic maps suggests that turbulence is driven in the ism of ho ii on large scales ( @xmath1 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the @xmath0 relation in the linear regime in ho ii is better reproduced by models where turbulence is coupled with a weak efficiency cooling of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between turbulence and the thermodynamics of the gas for structure formation in the ism . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis can be used to determine the scale on which kinetic energy is injected in the ism of dwarf irregular galaxies , and to derive , in a first approximation , the cooling rate of the gas . </S>"
