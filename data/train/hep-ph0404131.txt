    "the nucleon axial charge , @xmath1 , is a fundamental quantity in qcd as it in some sense quantifies spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the low - energy hadronic theory .",
    "it is known very accurately from neutron beta decay experiments , @xmath2 ( in units of the vector charge @xmath3 )  @xcite and therefore serves as an important test of nonperturbative , first - principles calculations of hadronic properties using lattice qcd .",
    "fortunately , it is relatively straightforward to compute @xmath1 in numerical lattice qcd simulations . in spite of this , there is still no consensus as regards @xmath1 from lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a trend toward under predicting  @xcite @xmath1 has led to some controversy regarding the possibility of large finite - volume effects  @xcite .",
    "a recent quenched simulation using domain - wall fermions over several volumes finds that large finite - volume effects do seem to account for the discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "the somewhat tentative current state - of - affairs is primarily due to the fact that current computational limitations use quark masses , @xmath4 , that are significantly larger than the physical values , lattice spacings , @xmath5 , that are not significantly smaller than the physical scales of interest , and lattice sizes , @xmath6 , that are not significantly larger than the pion compton wavelength  @xcite .",
    "it is confidence in the extrapolations of these quantities that will allow a confrontation between lattice qcd predictions for @xmath1 and other hadronic observables and experiment .",
    "while the dependence of @xmath1 on the lattice parameters can be described by an effective field theory ( eft ) , calculability requires maintaining the hierarchy of mass scales : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a typical momentum in the system of interest , @xmath9 is the pion mass and @xmath10 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath11 is the pion decay constant ) .",
    "lattice simulations are only now beginning to achieve the hierarchy of scales necessary to utilize a perturbative extrapolation .    here",

    "this bound ensures that ( non - pionic ) hadronic physics is completely contained inside the lattice volume . in addition , the bound @xmath15 ensures that the lattice volume has no effect on spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "these two bounds , taken together , then imply that in order to have a perturbative eft description @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath17 , and therefore @xmath18 , momentum zero - modes must be treated nonperturbatively  @xcite and one is in the so - called @xmath19-regime  -regime . however , to our knowledge no systematic finite - volume calculation of baryon properties has been done in the @xmath19-regime . ] .",
    "we will consider the range of pion masses  , @xmath20 , and therefore we will take @xmath21 , keeping in mind that the eft may be reaching the limits of its validity when this bound on @xmath6 is saturated , particularly when the pions are light . for the observables considered here ,",
