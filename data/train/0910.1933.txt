    "the roots of the idea that our four - dimensional universe might be a three - brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk can be traced back to string theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the present day brane world scenarios in their various flavors are influenced , in one way or other , by string theory .",
    "one of the most successful of such higher dimensional models is that proposed by randall and sundrum where our 4-dimensional world is considered as a brane in a 5-dimensional bulk having the geometry of an ads space @xcite .",
    "they were successful in explaining what is known as the hierarchy problem ; the enormous disparity between the strength of the fundamental forces .",
    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario has had a great impact on our understanding of the universe and has brought higher dimensional gravitational theories to the fore . in the rs type models",
    ", only gravitons can wander into the bulk whereas ordinary matter and gauge fields are confined to the brane .",
    "such a confinement is achieved by the application of the israel junction conditions . later on , shiromizu",
    ", maeda and sasaki ( sms ) @xcite showed how to systematically project the einstein field equations , written in the bulk , onto the brane using the gauss - codazzi equations and the israel junction conditions @xcite , assuming @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "these field equations differ from the standard einstein field equations in @xmath2 in that they have additional terms like @xmath3 which depend on the energy - momentum tensor on the brane and the electric part of the weyl tensor @xmath4 , leading to the appearance of a quadratic term in the friedmann equation @xcite .",
    "brane world scenarios have paved the way for a new understanding of dark matter among other things for which static , spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations on the brane are of primary interest @xcite . as an example , the galaxy rotation curves have been accounted for in @xcite by studying the vacuum solutions in a brane world scenario in which the brane admits a family of conformal killing vector fields , leading to exact solutions of the field equations in parametric forms .",
    "these solutions were then used to explain the galaxy rotation curves without postulating the existence of dark matter .",
    "other brane world scenarios have emerged since the seminal work of rs , the most influential of which is the model proposed by dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) @xcite . in this model",
    "the bulk space is assumed to be flat but there is an additional @xmath2 induced gravity term appearing in the action .",
    "the cosmological implications of the dgp model was first studied in @xcite where it was shown that the universe experiences a self accelerating phase at late times .",
    "the dgp model predicts modifications to gravity at large distances , in contrast to rs type models which modify gravity at small scales .",
    "other brane world models have been proposed in which the condition of @xmath1 symmetry is relaxed and the confinement of matter to the brane is achieved through the use of a confining potential @xcite .",
    "brane world models in the context of higher order gravity have also been studied @xcite where the gauss - bonnet term is included in the bulk action and the @xmath2 field equations are derived in the usual manner .",
    "theories of gravity in which the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action is replaced with a generic function of @xmath5 have been gaining momentum in the last few years . in this regard , brane world scenarios have also been proposed both in the context of @xmath6 scalar - tensor type models @xcite where such a function of the ricci scalar is assumed to form the action in the bulk and dgp models @xcite where the induced action on the brane contains the @xmath7 term . however , the study of a rs type model with @xmath7 as the action in bulk space has been lacking .",
    "such a setup would be of interest since there is no a priori reason as to why the action in @xmath6 should be the standard eh , in contrast to @xmath2 where the standard eh action seems to be , to a large extent , adequate in describing the cosmos .",
    "it is therefore the purpose of the present work to obtain the einstein field equations on the brane from a @xmath7 action in the bulk within the framework of the rs model , using the sms procedure . in doing so",
    ", we obtain the term @xmath8 which completely depends on @xmath0 and its derivatives .",
    "interestingly , for a conformally flat bulk space , this quantity is conserved , that is , @xmath9 .",
    "this is of course welcome since one may identify such a term with some kind of matter whose origins lie in the geometry of the bulk .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the work presented in @xcite is an attempt to assume a generic @xmath7 function as the action for the bulk space in the presence of a real scalar field .",
    "however , their method of obtaining the field equations on the brane is based on assuming a specific metric for the bulk which makes dealing with the problem different from what we propose to do .    in what follows ,",
    "we first derive the field equations on the brane from a generic @xmath0 action assumed for the bulk .",
    "we then study both the static , spherically symmetric and cosmological solutions of the resulting field equations .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "we start by deriving the einstein field equations on the brane , assuming the following action for the bulk @xmath10,\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the matter lagrangian , @xmath12 is the bulk metric and @xmath13 is the bulk ricci scalar .",
    "after variation of @xmath14 with respect to the bulk metric @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath16 where a prime represents derivative with respect to the argument . rearranging the above equation",
    ", we obtain the effective einstein field equations in the bulk @xmath17 where @xmath18.\\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain the field equations on the brane we start by invoking the gauss equations @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the induced metric on the brane , @xmath21 is the unit vector normal to the four - dimensional brane , @xmath22 is the riemann tensor on the brane and @xmath23 is the extrinsic curvature . after contracting equation ( [ eq5 ] ) one obtains @xmath24 and @xmath25h^a_{~\\mu}h^b_{~\\nu}+\\mathcal{r}_{ab}n^a",

    "assuming @xmath44 symmetry , we can replace the jump in the extrinsic curvature by the value of the extrinsic curvature at the location of the brane , hence @xmath45 now , by expressing the extrinsic curvature in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and using the relation @xmath46 obtained by contracting equations([eq2 ] ) , we finally obtain the effective einstein equations on the brane @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51_{y=0},\\label{eq24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath52 we note that for @xmath53 , we obtain the usual induced equations first obtained in @xcite .",
    "we also note that in the case of constant curvature bulk we have @xmath54 and by equation ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) we obtain @xmath55 since @xmath0 is a constant .",
    "this means that we can identify @xmath8 as representing the energy - momentum tensor of an unknown type of matter . in the case of an arbitrary curvature bulk",
    "we have the following conservation equation @xmath56",
    "in this section we consider static , spherically symmetric and cosmological solutions to the einstein field equations given by equation ( [ eq20 ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we start by studying the black hole solutions and then move on to study the cosmological solutions . in all the solutions presented below , we assume a specific form for the function @xmath7 , namely @xmath57 .",
    "we begin by taking the following static , spherically symmetric bulk metric @xmath58 if we assume that the brane is devoid of matter then the second and third terms in ( [ eq20 ] ) become zero . taking the normal vector to the brane as @xmath59 ,",
    "the einstein field equation becomes @xmath60 where @xmath8 is given by equation ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "let us take the constant curvature solutions of equation ( [ eq29 ] ) as @xmath61 the components of @xmath62 are then given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant depending on the cosmological constant @xmath65 and @xmath66 and obtained from the equation @xmath67 equation ( [ eq30 ] ) represents a schwarzschild - anti de - sitter like solution which is compatible with @xcite , so we can identify @xmath68 by @xmath69 as in ordinary schwarzschild solutions . in the case",
    "@xmath70 we recover the standard schwarzschild - anti de - sitter solution . in the case of a vanishing brane cosmological constant",
    ", we also have the above solution reduced to @xmath71 depending only on @xmath66",
    ". therefore , @xmath8 plays the role of the cosmological constant in this case .",
    "the form of the above solution suggests that , in very general terms , it may be used to explain the galaxy rotation curves .    for the sake of completeness , let us also consider the case where @xmath72 which has been considered in many works . in this case , the equation for @xmath73 is similar to equation ( [ eq32 ] ) except that the coefficient @xmath64 is replaced by @xmath74 . in the case of vanishing cosmological constant",
    "we find @xmath75      in order to investigate the cosmological solutions we consider the standard robertson - walker metric @xmath76+dy^2,\\label{eq35}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the scale factor .",
    "we now consider a perfect fluid form for the brane matter with a linear equation of state @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant . again , with @xmath59 and the assumption that the cosmological constants in both the bulk and brane are zero , we obtain the einstein field equations as follows @xmath80 let us consider a power law form for the scale factor @xmath81 the einstein equations then become @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 the solution is given by @xmath85     as a function of @xmath66 . ]    in figure [ fig1 ] we have plotted @xmath73 as a function of @xmath66 . for an accelerating universe we must have @xmath86 .",

    "we obtained the quantity @xmath8 which originates from the geometry of the bulk space . for a conformally flat bulk ,",
    "this quantity is conserved and could therefore be identified with a new kind of matter .",
