    "a full @xmath3 @xmath4 calculation was also performed @xcite for a specific combination of form factors which does not involve arbitrary renormalization constants .",
    "the result allowed to estimate the symmetry breaking corrections to a low energy theorem proposed by sirlin @xcite , which generalizes the ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite .",
    "the fundamental properties of causality and unitarity are important ingredients in chpt .",
    "dispersion relations for scattering amplitudes and form factors or their inverses were used in performing low order calculations @xcite , @xcite , or as a method of effective resummation of the high order terms @xcite , @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall consider an alternative dispersive method suitable especially for form factors @xcite,@xcite , which uses as input an information about the modulus along the unitarity cut , leading to constraints on the values inside the analyticity domain .",
    "the technique was for the first time combined with the ope expansion of a qcd polarization function in @xcite .",
    "recently , this formalism was successfully applied to the form factors describing the weak semileptonic decays of heavy mesons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "quite strong constraints on the shape of these form factors near zero recoil have been obtained by combining the dispersive formalism with the predictions of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the predictive power of the technique was considerably increased @xcite , @xcite , @xcite by the simultaneous treatment of several form factors with different unitarity thresholds , connected among them near zero recoil by hqet .",
    "it is of interest to apply this formalism to the form factors of the light pseudoscalar mesons , for which chiral symmetry predicts definite correlations for certain kinematical points .",
    "a first investigation of the weak form factors of the @xmath5 decay in this framework was performed in @xcite .",
    "similar techniques were applied in @xcite in order to parametrize the modulus of the pion electromagnetic form factor in the time like region . in the present paper",
    "we perform an analysis of the electromagnetic and weak form factors of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , with emphasis on their low energy expansions .",
    "the purpose of the investigation is to see whether the dispersive approach is useful for testing the rigorous predictions of chiral symmetry and for constraining the free parameters of chpt . to this end",
    "we present generalizations of the standard technique suitable for incorporating additional information provided by experiments or chpt .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the dispersive formalism : first we present the form factors of interest and some of their properties , then we describe the physical input of the method and the standard mathematical techniques used for optimally exploiting this input . in section 3 we illustrate the simultaneous treatment of several form factors with different unitarity branch points by performing a test of a low energy theorem of chpt . in section 4 we derive constraints on the taylor coefficients at zero momentum of the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "we first give the simple unitarity bounds obtained from the standard formalism and then show how they are improved using additional information on the phase and the modulus of the form factor along a part of the unitarity cut . in the last section we present some conclusions .",

    "the cut starts at @xmath15 for the electromagnetic form factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and at @xmath18 in the case of the weak form factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 . at @xmath21 the conservation of the electromagnetic current and the ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite",

    "it is useful to point out that an alternative integral condition for the electromagnetic form factors can be obtained by using as input , instead of ope in the euclidian region , a lower bound on the hadronic muon anomaly .",
    "this method was first proposed in @xcite , and starts from the the vacuum polarization contribution of the hadronic part of the muon anomaly @xmath71 where @xmath72 by introducing ( [ amu ] ) in the unitarity relation ( [ unitelm ] ) we obtain the inequality @xmath73{\\rm d}t\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which restricts the electromagnetic form factors along the unitarity cut . in the calculations we adopted the conservative lower bound @xmath74 @xcite , based on the experimental value , the weak radiative corrections and an estimate of the hadronic box diagram .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly review the standard techniques for exploiting in the optimal way the conditions ( [ condelm ] ) , ( [ condw ] ) , ( [ condit ] ) or ( [ condit1 ] ) in order to obtain constraints on the form factors and their derivatives inside the analyticity domain .",
    "it is useful to introduce a compact notation , defining the form factors @xmath75 as @xmath76 and denoting by @xmath77 the unitarity branch points : @xmath78 we now apply to each integral with the lower limit @xmath77 appearing in the conditions ( [ condelm ] ) , ( [ condw ] ) , ( [ condit ] ) or ( [ condit1 ] ) the following conformal mapping @xmath79 by this transformation the complex @xmath80 plane is mapped onto the unit disk in the complex plane @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 and the unitarity cut @xmath83 becomes the boundary @xmath84 . for simplicity",

    "the inequality ( [ l2norm ] ) is a standard boundary condition in @xmath100 norm for the functions @xmath101 @xcite , from which one obtains constraints on the size and shape of these functions at interior points .",
    "the results are expected to be stronger if one keeps in ( [ l2norm ] ) the contributions of all the functions @xmath101 and exploits in addition the correlations among them provided by symmetries at some kinematical points .",
    "this technique proved to be very useful in the case of the weak form factors of heavy mesons , using hqet near zero recoil . in principle , a difficulty in applying the formalism to the excited states is the presence of the unphysical cuts below the unitarity branch points . in the case of heavy mesons ,",
    "the unphysical cuts are well approximated by a few narrow resonances of known masses , which can be treated by adequate techniques with no assumption about the residua @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the situation is more complicated in the case of the light mesons .",
    "in applying the relation ( [ l2norm ] ) we recall that the functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 , _ i.e. _ the electromagnetic form factor of the pion and the weak form factors are analytic below their unitarity branch points , while the kaon electromagnetic form factors , denoted here as @xmath104 and @xmath105 , have an unphysical cut along the region @xmath106 , below the unitarity threshold of the @xmath107 production . in the variable @xmath81",
    "this cut is placed inside the unit disk @xmath108 , along the segment @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes the image of the two pion production threshold by the conformal transformation ( [ mapp ] ) for the kaon form factors : @xmath111 the dispersive formalism can be applied to this case only if some assumptions about the unphysical cut are adopted .",
    "for instance , if the phase of the kaon form factors along the unphysical cut is supposed to be known , the problem can be treated by means of a suitable modification of the standard techniques .",
    "then one can use the inequalities ( [ condelm ] ) or ( [ condit ] ) to correlate the low energy expansions of the electromagnetic and weak form factors or to test some predictions of chiral symmetry .",
    "in this section we will illustrate the procedure by testing the consistency of the relations ( [ sirlin1 ] ) proposed by sirlin @xcite , with the requirements of unitarity and perturbative qcd introduced in the condition ( [ condit ] ) .",
    "we adopt for the phase of the kaon electromagnetic form factors a model similar to the one proposed in @xcite for the pion form factor , and generalized to include a narrow @xmath112 resonance , with the su(3 ) relation @xmath113 between the residua .",
    "we assumed therefore that the phases of the form factors @xmath114 and @xmath115 along the unphysical region are @xmath116\\,,\\quad t_\\pi < t",

    "we shall use now the information on the phase in order to remove the unphysical cut of the kaon form factors . to this end",
    "we shall use a so - called omns function @xcite , which exactly compensates the known phase of the form factors along this part of the cut , leaving us with functions analytic below the unitarity threshold . in what follows",
    "we describe briefly the method .",

    "of course , there is a large arbitrariness in such an extension , but the results are independent of the particular values of @xmath123 for @xmath126 .",
    "the reason is that , being analytic and without zeros in the @xmath80-plane cut along @xmath127 , and with regular values on the boundary , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are outer functions , so by multiplying a class of functions with them , the class is not changed @xcite . by construction ,",

    "therefore , the inequality @xmath347 which follows from ( [ l2pi3 ] ) , defines an allowed domain in the plane of these taylor coefficients . in principle",
    "this domain can be further reduced : indeed , in addition to the boundary condition ( [ condlb1 ] ) , the function @xmath348 defined in ( [ f_pi ] ) has known error - affected values along the region @xmath321 , where it is holomorphic .",
    "the inclusion of this additional information is not trivial , and we will not treat this problem here , using the simple inequality ( [ l2pi3n ] ) . in particular , for @xmath230 and @xmath208 fixed , this inequality gives the allowed domain of the parameters @xmath210 and @xmath232 of the expansion ( [ taylor ] ) .    in a numerical application we used the same phase @xmath235 as in the preceeding subsection and the modulus @xmath349 from the aleph data @xcite . using @xmath350 and @xmath351 , we obtain for the quantity @xmath325 defined in ( [ m0 ] ) the estimate @xmath352 .",

    "we recall that these strong bounds are obtained with no specific parametrization and without any assumption about the high energy behaviour of the form factor .",
    "in the present paper we investigated the form factors of the light pseudoscalar mesons in a dispersive formalism which uses as input the ope expansion of the qcd polarization functions , combined with hadronic unitarity and analyticity .",
    "we derived constraints on the size and shape of the form factors , which are of interest in particular for testing the low energy predictions of chpt .",
    "generalizations of the original mathematical techniques , suitable for including additional informations about the form factors were developed .    in section 3",
    "we performed a test of sirlin s theorem @xcite , @xcite , which requires the vanishing of a certain combination of form factors which is free of arbitrary renormalization constants in chpt at @xmath360 . to this end",
    "we treated simultaneously in the dispersive formalism all the electroweak form factors of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "a difficulty is the large unphysical cut of the kaon electromagnetic form factors , which spoils the model independence of the results .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of heavy mesons , where the weak form factors of the ground state and of the excited ones have very close branch points and the unphysical cuts are well approximated by a few number of poles . in that case the simultaneous treatment of several form factors related among them by heavy quark symmetry led to strong model independent bounds near zero recoil @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the present paper we adopted for the phase of the kaon form factors along the unphysical cut a model inspired from the resonance chiral effective theory , which turned out to be consistent with qcd and sirlin s theorem .",

    "the main results are presented in section 4 , where we derived model independent constraints on the taylor coefficients of the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "we showed how to implement in the dispersive formalism the knowledge of the phase of the form factor along a part of the unitarity cut , even when this part consists of several disjoint intervals . to this end",
    "we applied the lagrange theory for functional optimization , which led to an integral equation for the generalized lagrange multiplier .",
    "the knowledge of the phase considerably improves the simple bounds on the higher taylor coefficients yielded by the dispersive formalism . in the present paper we illustrated this statement using a realistic model of the phase @xcite , which reproduces the one - loop chpt expression @xcite below @xmath361 and the present experimental data @xcite above @xmath362 .",
    "the accurate data provided on the phase @xmath363 by the future @xmath240 experiments @xcite,@xcite will be a precious input to the formalism . in section 4",
    "we obtained also improved constraints on the taylor coefficients if both the phase and the modulus of the form factor are given along a part of the cut , even if this information is used in an nonoptimal way .",
    "the interior of the ellipse shown in fig .",
