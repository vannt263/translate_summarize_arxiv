    "higher - dimensional gravity has been attracting a lot of attentions motivated by the tev - gravity scenarios @xcite .",
    "if the three - dimensional space is a @xmath0-brane in large or warped extra dimensions , the planck energy could be of @xmath1 , and the trans - planckian collision will happen at accelerators such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the intermediate state of a collision with sufficiently high energy and small impact parameter is expected to be a mini black hole , and this motivated a lot of works ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "at this time , no evidence for black hole signals has been found , and the restrictions for the planck energy and the minimum black hole mass @xmath2 ( such that the produced object can be regarded as a black hole if @xmath3 ) have been derived @xcite . another motivation for studying higher - dimensional gravity is the ads / cft correspondence , which conjectures the duality between gravity in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and the conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of that spacetime .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , the phenomena in cft for which direct calculation is difficult due to strong coupling effect can be predicted by calculating the dual gravitational system .",
    "one of the important approaches for higher - dimensional gravity is to explore the nonlinear dynamics of higher - dimensional spacetimes by numerical relativity .",
    "several formulations and codes of higher - dimensional numerical relativity have been developed so far @xcite , and interesting simulations have been performed : the time evolution of gregory - laflamme instability @xcite , slow - velocity collision of black holes @xcite , dynamics of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in kaluza - klein spacetimes @xcite , and bar - mode instability of rapidly rotating myers - perry black holes @xcite . in these works , time evolutions of spacetimes are simulated in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , which is the simplest theory of higher - dimensional gravity .",
    "one of the interesting extensions of higher - dimensional numerical relativity is to include the higher - curvature terms . in four dimensions ,",
    "the lagrangian density that leads to the second - order equation of the metric is just the ricci scalar .",
    "however , in higher - dimensions , the lagrangian density including higher - curvature terms also leads to the second - order equation if the combination of higher - curvature terms are chosen appropriately .",
    "these theories are gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity @xcite or , more generally , lovelock gravity @xcite . among these higher - curvature theories ,",
    "we take attention to gb gravity in this paper .",
    "the gb term gives a quadratic correction with respect to the riemann tensor to gr , and this gb correction arises in the low - energy limit of the heterotic string theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gb term may have important effects on the mini black hole phenomena at accelerators .",
    "also , the ads / cft correspondence in the context of gb gravity has been considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the black holes in gb gravity have interesting properties .",
    "although some part of gb gravity resembles gr , the other part does not .",
    "for example , the solution of a static spherically symmetric black hole found in ref .",
    "@xcite has two branches : the non - gr branch that is asymptotically ads and the gr branch that is asymptotically flat ( see @xcite for a detailed study on causal structures of these solution ) . the gb version of birkoff s theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite for lovelock gravity ) states that the spherically - symmetric vacuum spacetime ( at least locally ) corresponds to one of the two branches .",
    "the black hole of gr branch is shown to be unstable for @xmath4 against scalar mode and for @xmath5 against tensor mode if the coupling constant @xmath6 of the higher - curvature term is sufficiently larger than appropriate power of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant and @xmath9 is the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass of the black hole @xcite ( see also @xcite for a study that proves the generic appearance of instability of a spherically - symmetric black hole in lovelock gravity ) .    the gb version of numerical relativity ( say , numerical gb gravity ) , if it is developed , would play important roles to explore nonlinear phenomena in gb gravity .",
    "for example , the temporal evolution of the instability of a small spherically symmetric black hole could be followed by simulations to clarify the final end state .",
    "also , by simulating the time evolution from initial data of a nonstationary rotating black hole , it would be possible to obtain an indication for the stationary rotating black holes whose analytic solutions have not been found to date ( but see @xcite for a numerical construction of the black hole with two equal rotational parameters ) . of course , the simulation of high - velocity collision of black holes is an interesting issue to clarify the effect of higher - curvature terms on mini black hole phenomena at accelerators ( see @xcite for a partial result for a head - on collision of the aichelburg - sexl particles in gb gravity ) .",
    "there are few studies for numerical gb gravity .",
    "the @xmath10 formalism , which is the extension of the adm formalism to gb gravity , has been done by torii and shinkai @xcite . similarly to the adm formalism , einstein - gauss - bonnet equation is decomposed into the hamiltonian and momentum constraints and the evolution equations . on the other hand , the numerically stable formalism of gb gravity which is analogous to , e.g. , baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formalism @xcite has not been developed yet , and also",
    ", no simulation of numerical gb gravity has been done .",
    "when one simulates a spacetime in gb gravity , similarly to the case of gr , the first step is to prepare an initial spacelike hypersurface ( i.e. , initial data ) by solving the constraint equations . in this paper , we focus attention to the method for preparing initial data of black hole systems in gb gravity . as a first step ,",
    "the initial data are assumed to be momentarily static ( i.e. , time symmetric ) . in gr ,",
    "the brill - lindquist initial data @xcite are well known and widely used as the initial data of momentarily static multi black holes ( see also @xcite for higher - dimensional studies ) .",
    "we discuss the extension of the brill - lindquist initial data to gb gravity , and successfully generate the initial data for one black hole and two equal - mass black holes .    using the two - black - hole initial data",
    ", we discuss whether the penrose inequality @xcite holds in this system .",
    "the penrose inequality states that the area of an apparent horizon ( ah ) is not greater than that of the schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole with the same adm mass . in the case of the momentarily static initial data ,",
    "the penrose inequality was proved for @xmath11 using the conformal flow method @xcite .",
    "it is of interest whether such a bound on the ah area holds or not in gb gravity .",
    "in addition to the original penrose inequality , we also discuss whether the ah area is bounded from above by that of the spherically - symmetric black hole in gb gravity .",
    "the results suggest that both of the inequalities are held in this system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review gb gravity and @xmath10 formalism in this theory focusing attention to the part that is related to our study . in sec .",
    "iii , general framework for constructing the gb version of the brill - lindquist initial data is explained .",
    "the equation for the conformal factor @xmath12 is a laplace equation with formal source term which is highly nonlinear in @xmath12 , and we prove the regularity of the source term which is necessary for the existence of the solution . in sec .",
    "iv , the one - black - hole initial data are constructed numerically , and we show the agreement of the data with the time - symmetric slice of a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime . in sec .",
    "v , the two - black - hole initial data are constructed . using those data",
    ", we analyze the condition for the ah formation , and the penrose inequalities in this system are discussed .",
    "vi is devoted to summary and discussion . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the unit @xmath13 , while the gravitational constant @xmath8 is explicitly written .",

    ", @xmath14 denotes the dimensionality of the spacetime @xmath15 with the metric @xmath16 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath17 , which is the dimensionality of a spacelike hypersurface @xmath18 in the spacetime @xmath15 . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume the spacetime to be vacuum .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet action @xcite in @xmath14-dimensional spacetime is @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the ricci scalar , the ricci tensor , and the riemann tensor , respectively , and @xmath6 is the coupling constant with dimensionality of squared length .",
    "the action   gives the gravitational equation as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the case @xmath27 , the term @xmath28 in the action gives a topological invariant as proved in the generalized gauss - bonnet theorem @xcite , and hence @xmath29 .",

    "the reason for this conjecture as follows .",
    "if the cosmic censorship holds , an ah is formed in an eh , and since the eh is located outside of the ah , its area is expected to be larger than that of the ah . because of the area theorem by hawking , the area of the eh will increase and asymptote to that of a final stationary black hole . since the horizon area of a rotating black hole is smaller than that of a schwarzschild black hole with the same mass , and the final mass is smaller than the adm mass because of the gravitational radiation , the inequality is expected to hold . on the other hand , if the system with an ah whose area is greater than the bound of , the validity of the cosmic censorship , one of the assumptions of the above discussion , may be suspected .",
    "the penrose inequality has been attracting a lot of attentions , and it was proved for momentarily static initial data for @xmath27@xmath244 @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "this example does not contradict the cosmic censorship , but contradicts the assumption that the area of the eh is larger than that of the ah .",
    "but the penrose inequality can be modified to match this counterexample as follows .",
    "the ah in a usual sense can be regarded as a `` black hole ah '' since it is formed in a black hole . on the other hand",
    ", we can consider a `` white hole ah '' formed in a white hole whose past - directed outgoing null geodesic congruence has zero expansion . in the above counterexample",
    ", the black hole ah is located inside of the white hole ah , and the area of the white hole ah satisfies the penrose inequality .",
    "therefore , if we adopt the outermost horizon , the penrose inequality still holds .",
    "this penrose inequality for the outermost horizon can be proved in spherically - symmetric case assuming weak energy condition @xcite .    in gb gravity ,",
    "the relation between the penrose inequality and the cosmic censorship becomes unclear because the above reasoning for the penrose inequality may not hold since @xmath219 may violate the energy condition .",

    "the proof for the gr case can not be applied to the gb case at least straightforwardly , because it is unclear if @xmath219 satisfies the energy condition .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to test the inequality using the initial data constructed in this paper .",
    "other than the original version of the penrose inequality , we can consider another inequality that may be expected to hold in gb gravity .",

    "the values of @xmath249 are smaller than unity , suggesting that the inequality   is kept in this system .",

    "is that the typical one - dimensional length of the system is restricted from above if an ah is formed , implying that an arbitrarily long ah does not form . but this statement holds only for @xmath27 , because the black hole can be arbitrarily long in higher dimensions as expected from the black string solution , and explicitly shown in @xcite .",

    "this hyperhoop conjecture was discussed in several papers @xcite , and the results support its effectiveness .",
    "let us consider a two - black - hole system with total mass @xmath9 , and suppose the two black holes to be momentarily at rest with a typical distance @xmath259 . in four dimensions ,",

    "the numerical work in this paper is the first step toward simulations of black holes in gb gravity , and a lot of extensions can be considered .",
    "for example , it is necessary to extend our method of generating time - symmetric initial data to the method of generating time - asymmetric initial data like a boosted black hole . for this purpose ,",
