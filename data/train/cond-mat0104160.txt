    "recently , many experiments@xmath6 have detected there exists a soliton lattice phase between spatially homogenous commensurate phase with finite gap and incommensurate ( ic ) phase with vanishing gap ( free massless boson field ) when some quasi - one - dimensional(1d ) spin - peierls ( sp ) materials were placed in an external magnetic field .",
    "these experiments confirm the 20-year - old prediction of a field - induced transition from the sp state into a spin - lattice modulated phase@xmath7 and demonstrated that this novel phase has the form of a soliton lattice.@xmath8 the density of solitons can be tuned continuously by adjusting the magnetic field , so that their internal structure can be systematically studied",
    ".    in deed , physical realization of sp systems offers the unique possibility to check the understanding of this fundamental 1d hamiltonian for arbitrary band filling . applying the canonical jordon - wigner transformation ,",
    "the hamiltonian of such a sp chain placed in an external magnetic field @xmath9 can be mapped onto that of interacting ( spinless ) fermions system with band filling tuned by @xmath9 . an convenient way to deal with 1d fermi systems",
    "is bosonization . after adopting the bosonization technique ,",
    "the hamiltonian of such a 1d fermi system is transformed into a modified sine - gordon model with a linear spatial modulation in the cosine potential . in the boson picture ,",

    "it is neglected in present paper .",
    "an alternative realization of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with fixed @xmath15 refers to the interaction fermion system with tunable particle concentration .",
    "for example , the charge - density - wave degree freedom of the 1d extended hubbard model@xmath17 is described by this model .",
    "away from the half filling , or @xmath18 , people usually assumes that the cosine potential can be neglected due to the rapid oscillation.@xmath19 however , according to this statement , the energy gap would drop suddenly to zero at @xmath20 .",
    "we believe it is more likely that the cosine potential might experience an intermediate lattice phase before entering into the free boson field regime .    in absence of @xmath15 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is a standard quantum sine - gordon model .",
    "many works have been done about this case both in field theory and in condensed matter physics.@xmath21 by a variational method coleman@xmath22 first discovered that the energy density of the system is unbounded below when the coupling constant @xmath23 exceeds @xmath24 , this corresponds to the kosterlitz - thouless ( k - t ) phase transition by the equivalence between the 2d coulomb gas and sine - gordon model , the ground state is a spatially homogenous commensurate phase .    in presence of finite @xmath15",
    ", the spatial modulation parameter favors the ic phase whereas the cosine term itself favors the commensurate phase , this makes the model more complicated .",
    "previously , many results for the hamiltonian ( 1 ) have been obtained in the classical limit.@xmath25 in the quantum case , this cosine potential is usually considered to shrink to zero with any finite @xmath15 , the crossover between commensurate and ic phases would happen abruptly .",
    "schulz has discussed a similar quantum system as hamiltonian ( 1)@xmath26 , he found that the domain wall structure appeared in the ground state in the case of the chemical potential exceeding a threshold value and the energy gap was finite , for large chemical potential the presence of the gap was unimportant .",
    "in fact , his result implied that there existed a soliton lattice phase which had finite density of domain walls between commensurate phase with finite gap and ic phase with vanishing gap .    after taking a shift @xmath27",
    ", the hamiltonian ( 1 ) seems as same as that of schulz .",
    "but if one pays attention to the boundary condition of boson operator @xmath11 , he will find that two models are different since the boundary conditions of system will be altered under this shift , namely , @xmath28 , therefore the physical properties will be also changed .",
    "we prefer the former ( zero charge sector ) , since this integral is proporational to the particle number after normal ordering in the fermion picture . to our knowledge , with finite @xmath15 , the complicated configuration between commensurate and ic phases has not been explored clearly .    in present paper ,",
    "we develop a new method to give a quantitative discussion on the soliton lattice phase of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "our basic idea refers to a variational procedure with respect to a spatially inhomogenious gaussian wave functional which is introduced to determine an approximate ground state of the model .",
    "our results show that as long as @xmath15 shifts from zero , the soliton lattice phase appears in the ground state for @xmath29 . only in the regime of @xmath5",
    "the ic phase with vanishing gap can emerge in the ground state for small @xmath30 .",
    "the paper is set up as following . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a new spatially inhomogenious gaussian wave functional and calculate the energy and the renormalization mass of the ground state . the phase diagram and the evolvement of the soliton lattice phase with varying spatial modulation parameter",

    "it is obviously difficult and far beyond our present abilities to solve this equation for the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "here we try a variational method by choosing some general ansatz for @xmath32 , then we calculate the expectation value of the hamiltonian and minimize the energy with respect to the variational parameters in the ansatz .",
    "if we consider the field operator @xmath33 , the cosine term will oscillate in the space yielding zero contribution to the ground state .",
    "this may not be the most favorable configuration of the ground states .",
    "one may shift @xmath11 to compensate @xmath34 as much as possible to lower the value of the cosine potential term , however , the integration of @xmath35 should be zero since it must satisfy the boundary condition . thus @xmath11 should take a kink after some distance , moreover , the modulation of @xmath11 induces a  distortion energy  @xmath36(@xmath37 .",
