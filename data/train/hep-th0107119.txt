    "this suggests that the number of traces is a conserved quantum number at large @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , disconnected graphs dominate in two - point functions of multi - trace operators , so it appears that a product of single - trace operators gives a state which is a direct product of noninteracting single particle states .",
    "altogether , this leads to the conclusion that the number of particles in ads should be mapped into the number of traces in the cft .",
    "it is well known that the dominance of planar graphs at large @xmath21 is only true for operators whose dimensions are small . for correlation functions of operators",
    "whose dimensions scale sufficiently fast with @xmath21 , it fails badly @xcite .",
    "it is readily checked that when @xmath19 is sufficiently large , combinatorial factors in non - planar diagrams can overwhelm the usual suppression by powers of @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath19 is large , even the planar calculation ( [ ortho ] ) does not show orthogonality of states created by operators with different numbers of traces .",
    "for example , ( [ ortho ] ) shows that the planar contribution to the two - point function scales as : @xmath69 it is rather unlikely that the large non - planar contributions to this two - point function will conspire to cause it to cancel at large @xmath21 , although they should correct the apparently non - unitary growth of ( [ 2ptgrow ] ) , in conjunction with non - perturbative effects .",
    "the salient point is that although it is hard to do an exact computation of the two - point function even in free field theory , there is no reason to expect that states created by high dimension operators with different numbers of traces are orthogonal .",
    "`` trace number '' is simply not a good quantum number .",
    "a consequence of this for the ads / cft duality is that we can not map cft trace number into particle number in an ads fock space for states of high dimension .",

    "the effective mass of the scalar field , induced by the large angular momentum , is @xmath74 .",

    "equivalently , semiclassical supergravity calculations can only trusted for particles with masses below the string scale ( @xmath76 ) and the planck scale ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "another criterion that can be applied is to require that the wavelength of modes on the @xmath8 is larger than the string length or planck length .",
    "this gives bounds @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "it is clear that for such small values of @xmath19 the two - point function ( [ ortho ] ) approaches zero , the planar approximation is valid , and the standard mapping of one - particle states to single - trace operators continues to hold .    in  @xcite",
    ", it was argued that a large class of states with large angular momenta should be described by spherical , bps d3-branes which are extended on @xmath8 but localized at a point on @xmath70 .",
    "such spherical brane configurations on an @xmath8 of radius @xmath20 are supported by the angular momentum @xmath19 and the @xmath21 units of background flux .",

    "since @xmath81 can not exceed @xmath20 , there is a bound on the angular momentum @xmath82 .",
    "the semiclassical description of giants shows that there is a clear distinction between single- and multi - giant states , and that , despite being non - perturbative objects , they interact weakly with perturbative gravitons and with each other .",

    "the dual cft two - point function ( [ ortho ] ) shows that the planar approximation for correlation functions , and with it the argument for orthogonality of multi - trace operators , breaks down at least when @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , since single- and multi - giant states are clearly orthogonal at weak coupling , large giants can not be described by single- and multi - trace chiral primaries of large r - charge .",
    "indeed , traces can be a good description at most when @xmath86 .",
    "what is more , since trace number is not a good quantum number at large @xmath19 , the bound on the r - charge of single trace chiral primaries can not be mapped meaningfully to the angular momentum bound for giant gravitons .",

    ", these wrapped d3-branes can not split into multi - brane or brane - graviton states .",
    "the corresponding chiral operator in the cft is therefore easy to identify , since it must be the lowest - dimension chiral operator with a certain conserved charge corresponding to the wrapping charge of the brane . in many cases",
    "this charge is a baryon number , and the operator is baryon - like .    in each case , there are also chiral operators with the cancelling topological charge . a product of chiral operators , each of which carries topological charge but whose combination is neutral , is naturally associated to a combination of wrapped d3-branes each of which is topologically nontrivial but which when joined together are topologically trivial .",
    "such d3-branes are in the same class as the giant gravitons of  @xcite , which are topologically - trivial bps brane states that are dynamically stabilized by their angular momentum",
    ". as we will see , these products of topologically - charged chiral operators are always determinants of neutral combinations of the matrix - valued fields in the cft .",
