    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide the possibility of creating in the laboratory a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons , or qgp . so far a large amount of interesting data have been accumulated in the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , which strongly suggest a new kind of matter may have been formed at rhic .",
    "one of the most striking evidences of the formation of qgp is the strong suppression of hadron spectra with large transverse momentum ( or high @xmath3 ) in @xmath1 collisions as compared to @xmath2 collisions  @xcite .",
    "this kind of suppression agrees with the prediction of jet quenching theory  @xcite , which has provided compelling explanations on many novel phenomena at high @xmath3 observed at rhic , such as the suppression of @xmath5 production at high @xmath3 , and the disappearance of back - to - back correlations of high @xmath3 hadrons  @xcite .    in the picture of jet quenching or parton energy loss ,",
    "an energetic parton will loss energy by multiple scattering in the medium when it propagates through the hot qgp medium .",
    "the majority of current approaches to the medium - induced parton energy loss may be divided into four major schemes which included higher twist(ht )  @xcite , path integral approach to the opacity expansion ( bdmps - z / asw )  @xcite , finite temperature field theory approach(amy )  @xcite and reaction operator approach to the opacity expansion ( glv )  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the energy loss of light quarks and gluons is proportional to the gluon density and has a quadratic dependence on the total distance traversed by the propagating parton due to the non - abelian lpm interference effect in multiple scatterings  @xcite .",
    "moreover it is expected that the gluon energy loss in nuclei is @xmath6 times of the quark energy loss due to the different color factors for quark - gluon vertex and gluon - gluon vertex  @xcite . because high @xmath3 proton ( anti - proton ) production in @xmath2 collisions is dominated by gluon fragmentation whereas high @xmath3 pion at @xmath2 collisions is dominated by quark fragmentation , it is expected that larger gluon energy loss than quark energy loss in hot / dense medium will lead to a smaller @xmath0 ratio at high @xmath3 in @xmath1 collisions than in @xmath2 collisions at the same energy @xcite .    however , star collaboration recently published very interesting measurements which indicate that @xmath7 and @xmath8 ratios at high @xmath3 in central au+au collisions  @xcite approach those in @xmath2 and @xmath9 collisions  @xcite , and the nuclear modification factor of protons is similar to that of pions @xcite . to solve the discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations ,",

    "it is found that conversions between quark and gluon jets indeed lead to an increase in the final number of gluon jets in central heavy ion collisions than the case without conversions , but to explain experimental data observed by star a conversion enhancement factor @xmath10 would be needed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the @xmath0 ratio in @xmath1 collisions with @xmath11 gev by using a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd inspired parton model , which has been very successful in describing the high @xmath3 region physics in @xmath2 collisions  @xcite .",
    "later by including the nuclear effects it is extended to consider the single hadron and di - hadron productions in @xmath1 collisions and has given a very good description on the high @xmath3 pion and charged hadron productions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation in the model shows that the ratio of gluon / quark jets in nlo is larger than in lo calculations  @xcite . in the same framework",

    "to explain the observed @xmath0 ratios at star collaboration phenomenologically , two different scenarios in jet quenching theory are considered : one is the case that gluon energy loss is equal to quark energy loss in nuclear medium ; another with a strong jet conversion mechanism where a appreciable quark jets are converted into gluon jets",
    ". both scenarios will effectively increase the total number of final gluon jets passing through the hot qgp medium , and thus give a higher @xmath0 ratios , which are found to reproduce the experimental data fairly well .",

    "therefore the final fractions of gluon and quark jets contributing to the hadron spectra will be modified by the net quark - to - gluon conversion .",
    "furthermore , our numerical results in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fraction ] ) show that even if without net quark - to - gluon conversions high @xmath3 proton ( anti - proton ) production is dominated by gluon fragmentations whereas high @xmath3 pion is dominated by quark fragmentations in central @xmath1 collisions .",
    "consequently , larger @xmath0 ratios are found in central @xmath1 collisions with conversion than without conversion , @xmath116 and @xmath117 shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ratio - p - pie - conversion ] ) .",
    "similar to the case in fig.([fig : ratio - p - pie ] ) , the ratios of ( anti)-proton over pion in central @xmath1 collisions with conversion are smaller than those in @xmath2 collisions . according to @xmath118 from fig .",
    "( [ spec - pie - conversion])([fig : spec - proton - conversion ] ) , one can get @xmath119 as one can see in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ratio - p - pie - conversion ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 ratios in central @xmath1 collisions with conversion are similar to those in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "however @xmath8 ratios in central @xmath1 collisions with conversion are smaller than those in @xmath2 collisions because the number of anti - quark jets is smaller than that of quark jets and the effect of conversion mechanism is not obvious for anti - quark jets .",
    "we note that in the conventional jet quenching theory , because a gluon jet always lose more energy than a quark jet with the same initial energy in a hot qcd medium ( except in the case when both quark jet and gluon jet lose all of their energies ) , and at high @xmath3 @xmath77 meson is dominated by valence quark fragmentation whereas proton is dominated by gluon fragmentation , the @xmath0 ratio at large transverse momentum in @xmath2 collision should be no less than those in @xmath45 collisions .",
    "the two scenarios considered in this paper will raise the @xmath0 ratios in @xmath45 collisions therefore becoming closer to those in @xmath2 , but will never go beyond . only in the extreme case in @xmath45 collisions at large @xmath3 ,",
    "all quark jets are converted into gluon jets , or equivalently there are only gluon jets , we can get higher @xmath0 ratio in @xmath45 collisions at large @xmath3 . though current data at star seems to imply that proton over pion ratio in @xmath1 reactions is enhanced relative to that in @xmath2 collisions , with large error bars at high @xmath3",
    ", we still can not reach a unambiguous conclusion . if in the future more accurate experimental measurements confirm that at high @xmath3 region , @xmath0 ration in @xmath45 collision is enhanced significant compared with that in @xmath2 collision , a dramatic change of our understanding of parton energy loss mechanism will be needed .",
    "because we focus on @xmath0 ratios at the high @xmath3 region , in our calculations we have ignored the contribution of parton recombination / coalescence mechanism in the qgp .",
    "we expect this negligence underlines the rather large discrepancy between our numerical simulations and experimental data in the intermediate @xmath3 region , where the recombination / coalescence mechanism in the hot qgp should play a very important role @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigate @xmath114 and @xmath115 ratios at large transverse momentum in @xmath1 collisions with jet quenching based on an next - to - leading order pqcd parton model .",
    "two scenarios are considered to explain the anomaly of @xmath0 ratios observed by star collaboration that @xmath0 ratios at high @xmath3 in central @xmath1 collisions  @xcite approach those in @xmath2 and @xmath9 collisions  @xcite .",
    "firstly , we investigate the consequence in scenario i where gluons lose the same amount of energy in qgp as quarks and demonstrate that it will enhance the @xmath114 and @xmath115 ratios for central @xmath1 collisions .",
    "secondly , we explore the effect of strong jet conversion in scenario ii where a net of quark - to - gluon conversion also result in similar @xmath114 and @xmath115 ratios in central @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions . in both scenarios , the final number of gluon jets passing through the hot and dense medium is increased as compared to the original jet quenching picture , and jet conversion scenario is favorable when @xmath28 ratio is considered because @xmath4 in the latter scenario is found to fit data better than that in the former scenario .",
    "this kind of studies should improve our understanding on the flavor dependence of energy loss and lead us to a unified picture of jet quenching .",
    "we note that in our approach the effect of energy loss is taken into account through the medium - modified effective fragmentation functions and the evolution of the hot nuclear medium is described by a simple 1 + 1d bjorken evolution based on hard - sphere geometry .",
    "this approach has given very well descriptions on inclusive pion suppression  @xcite , di - hadron production  @xcite and photon - tagged hadron production  @xcite , but several improvements will be needed to make a more realistic consideration of parton energy loss in the hot medium created at rhic .",
    "one direction is to simulate the medium evolution with the 3 + 1d hydrodynamics model as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which may give corrections to the total parton energy loss though the effect of local density dropping due to the transverse expansion of the medium will be offset by the longer path length in the transverse direction @xcite in the qgp phase .",
    "also one could study the in - medium parton shower @xcite to make a more differential study of jet quenching than the adoption of the effectively modified parton fragmentation function .",
    "furthermore a more detailed medium dependence of jet energy loss can be obtained by introducing the energy loss probability distributions @xcite , which will reduce the difference of energy losses of quark and gluon jets by properly incorporating kinematical constraints , and thus raise the @xmath0 ratios .",
    "last but not the least , in our calculation we have assumed that the pions and protons are formed outside of the medium , and the hadronization of pions and protons in a+a collisions are the same as that in p+p collisions .",
    "larger @xmath0 ratios may be obtained and help to resolve the @xmath0 puzzles observed in a+a collisions at star if one assumes that protons in a+a collisions can be formed inside the medium due to its larger mass relative to pion , though so far how to model hadronizations of partons with large @xmath3 in medium and whether it is distinct from that in vacuum is still an open question and under hot debate .",
    "nevertheless , intensive theoretical studies will be needed to see whether we can resolve the puzzle of @xmath0 ratios in a more beautiful and natural way by improving our model and including all the relevant effects discussed above .",
