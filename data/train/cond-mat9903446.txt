    "whereas classical ordinary diffusion of a single particle is universally known , diffusion of _ interacting _ particles does not seem to have drawn much attention .",
    "a notable exception is the seminal paper by fisher @xcite , which introduces basic ideas and solves , in various cases , the problem of finding the probability for the reunion of a given number of `` drunken walkers '' wandering on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the so - called tracer problem also received some attention , following the solution given by harris @xcite for the @xmath2 case ( recent bibliography on this subject can be found in mallick thesis @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , intensive work @xcite , @xcite and references therein , has been done one the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( @xcite ) which describes the biased motion of a lattice gas with hard - core interaction .",
    "the interaction between diffusing particles appears to be relevant in many fields : one - dimensional hopping conductivity @xcite , ion transport in biological membranes @xcite , @xcite , channelling in zeolithes @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the interactions are expected to play a dominant role in low - dimensionality systems and/or sytems with geometrical constraints .",
    "such problems have been analyzed in the continuous space limit of the so - called single - file model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "i here consider one of the simplest problems , namely that of two diffusing particles on a @xmath2-lattice with a repulsive contact interaction , by directly solving the lattice master equation using elementary methods and obtaining the exact two - body probability at all times ; this allows to find the behaviour @xmath3 of the mean square dispersion of the coordinates .",
    "the totally asymmetric version of this problem ( directed random walk in which each particle can move only in one direction ) was treated in ref .",
    "@xcite using a bethe ansatz ; among other results , these authors gave explicit asymptotic behaviour of the two first moments of the coordinates in the case of two diffusing particles .",
    "the continuous space limit of the model here considered is simply related to the problem of a single fictitious particle subjected to a perfectly reflecting barrier , as shown below . on the other hand , working on a lattice",
    "seems to be usually the most natural approach on physical grounds and is even a necessity when no continuous limit exists ; an example of such a situation is the pure growth problem , equivalent to a directed walk , for which continuous limit of the master equation generates a purely mechanical liouville equation , in which diffusive effects have disappeared @xcite .",
    "when the continuous limit exists , it is expected on physical grounds that both versions provide essentially the same results in the long time limit , when part of the microscopic details become irrelevant . nevertheless ,",
    "although leading terms are expected to coincide , subdominant corrections may play a rather important role , as shown below , since they usually follow power - laws in time with small exponents entailing that corrections are long - lived .",
    "when the relevant experimental timescale is short , results obtained by scaling hand - waving asymptotic arguments are of little physical interest and continuous models may even display serious shortcomings : as an example , as shown below , the velocity at short times turns out to be infinite in the continuous approximation whereas its lattice analogue is perfectly well defined and is finite .",
    "in addition , somewhat surprinsingly , lattice effects persist even in the final regime , as constrasted to the ordinary diffusion of a single particle .",
    "this is why , as a whole , lattice models in continuous time are worthy to investigate : the discreteness of space , appearent in the transient as well as in the long - time dynamics , is not a minor feature of the problem . to be sure , lattice problems are by nature less `` universal '' than continuous ones in the sense that most results obtained in such a framework usually depend on microscopic details such as the lattice structure ( @xcite ) ; nevertheless , they usually contain much more physically relevant information than continuous ones and , as such , can suggest high - resolved in time new experiments .",

    "ii ) when separated by more that one lattice spacing , each member of the pair has a symmetric diffusive motion , independently of the other ; for simplicity , it is assumed that hopping can occur between one site and its nearest - neighbours .",
    "the hopping probability per unit time is denoted as @xmath7 and allows to define a diffusion constant @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the lattice spacing and @xmath10 the diffusion time .",
    "iii ) when the two particles are located on two adjacent sites , each of them can only move onto the empty available site : this models the contact interaction . as a consequence",
    ", the two particles can not stand on the same site and can not cross each other .",
    "any initial condition thus definitely induces a left - right symmetry breaking .",
    "conventionally , with the above initial condition , the particle located at @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) at time @xmath12 will be given the label @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) .    with these assumptions , the master equation ( m. e. ) for the probability @xmath14 to find the two particles located on sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 at time @xmath17 can be written following the standard procedure .",
    "one first considers the evolution of @xmath14 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a finite time interval , by exhausting all basic elementary jumps and expressing their probabilities in terms of the products @xmath20 ; by forming the difference @xmath21 , by dividing both sides by @xmath19 and taking the limit @xmath22 , one eventually obtains the time - continuous following m. e.

    "the lattice effects indeed go to zero at infinite times , but in such a slow manner that subdominant terms can not be neglected on reasonably large times .    on the opposite , with no surprise , the behaviours at short times are markedly different ( see ( [ m11tcourt ] ) and fig.[figxx2tc ] ) ;",
    "for instance , the finite initial drift velocity in the lattice model ( see ( [ m11tcourt ] ) , which could be observed with high - time resolution experiments , is infinite in the continuous approximation ( eq .",

    "the additional term to the current is negative for all @xmath143 , as it must clearly be .",
    "obviously enough , the results of the continuum approximation are related to the simpler problem of a single fictitious brownian particle in the presence of a perfectly reflecting wall . for the two particles 1 and 2 , the diffusion equation writes : @xmath144 the solution here satisfying the initial and boundary conditions",
    "@xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "an easy way to solve such an equation is to transform to the center - of - mass frame by setting @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ; indeed , the diffusion constant @xmath115 plays the same role as an inverse mass in a mechanical two - body problem .",
    "this allows to rewrite the diffusion equation ( [ diffusion ] ) as the following : @xmath150 with @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "equation ( [ diffcdm ] ) displays the diffusion of the center - of - mass ( with a constant @xmath113 ) , decoupled from the diffusion of the relative coordinate ( with a constant @xmath114 ) in the presence of a perfectly reflecting barrier at the origin .",
    "this means that the problem can be solved in two steps , by considering first the diffusive motion of a single fictitious particle with a doubled diffusion constant and by subsequently adding the effect of the center - of - mass motion . as a whole ,",
    "the solution of the present problem in its continuous version is given by : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the normalized gaussian function describing the free diffusive motion of the center of mass with the diffusion constant @xmath113 , whereas @xmath155 is the solution for the single particle ( fictitious ) constrained by the reflecting wall .",
    "as well known ( gardiner , 1990 ) , if the fictitious particle stands at @xmath156 with probability one at @xmath4 , one has : @xmath157 by taking @xmath158 , by using ( [ soldiff ] ) and by performing all the integrations , one recovers the expression given in ( [ px1x2 t ] ) , directly obtained as the limit taken from the lattice version .",
    "note however that the present problem can not be considered as a single particle one : the separation of the center - of - mass motion is trivial in the sense that it happens as the consequence of discrete space homogeneity , but this center - of - mass , itself having a diffusive motion ( not a purely kinematical one ) , does participate to the spreading in such a way that correlations are always present ; this is the reason why @xmath159 does not factor out ( see ( [ px1x2 t ] ) and ( [ px1x2tfou ] ) ) and sustains never - ending correlations , as simply expressed by ( [ corrt ] ) . on a deeper level , it is seen that the stochastic motion of each particle is no more markoffian : the fourier transforms ( [ f1carc ] ) , ( [ f2carc ] ) are not of the form @xmath160 and do not satisfy the bachelier - smoluchovski - chapman - kolmogorov chain equation .",
    "the presence of one particle thus strongly alters the nature of the motion of the other .",
    "the simple problem of two particles diffusing on a lattice with contact repulsive interaction was fully solved at all times by finding the two - particle characteristic function , from which marginal one - particle densities and moments can be easily derived . at short times , the repulsion induces a linear increase of the position for each particle , associated to a finite velocity , and a linear variation of the second cumulant , with a diffusion constant which is halved for obvious physical reasons . in the final regime",
    ", each particle still has an effective anomalous drift , its coordinate growing like @xmath0 , associated to a vanishing velocity .",
    "on the other hand , the mean square dispersion asymptotically follows a normal diffusion law ; nevertheless , by comparison with its value in the absence of interaction , the diffusion constant is reduced by the non - trivial factor @xmath90 . as a whole , there is a cross - over between two normal diffusion regimes , the diffusion constant varying from @xmath113 at short times to @xmath161 at large times . independently of the long - lived subdominant terms",
    ", it is seen that each particle does not recover its `` free '' diffusion constant , even at infinite times .",
    "for sure , this is a low - dimensionnality effect .    taking the limit of continuous space",
    "first allows to make explicit connection with the problem of a fictitious particle in the presence of a totally reflecting barrier .",
    "second , by analyzing this limit , it can be seen that marked differences exist between the lattice and the continuous versions . with no surprise ,",
    "behaviours at short times are very different ( the initial drift is finite in the lattice , infinite in the continuum ) .",
    "in addition , due to weakly decreasing subdominant terms , behaviours still substantially differ in both frameworks , even at large times : it can be said that lattice effects persist for physically relevant times , formally vanishing only at infinite times .",
    "thus , when it is a given physical feature , the discreteness of space can not be ignored .",
