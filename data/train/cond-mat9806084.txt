    "the phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in hole - doped rare - earth manganites has , in recent times , been the subject of intense research efforts  @xcite .",
    "these oxides belong to the abo@xmath2 class of perovskite oxides and contain a mixed valency of mn , which occupies the b site .",
    "the a site is occupied by rare - earth ions like nd , la etc . or by divalent ions like pb , ca etc",
    ". these oxides , therefore , have the general formula re@xmath3ae@xmath4mno@xmath2 , where re is la , nd etc . and",
    "ae is ca , pb etc .",
    "there are a number of basic issues which need to be resolved to understand the unusual transport properties of these materials .",
    "one of the interesting properties is the sharp peak in resistivity ( @xmath5 ) close to its ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the peak in @xmath5 is generally believed to arise from an insulator - metal like transition on cooling below @xmath1 .",
    "since the system shows a transition from an insulator like state above @xmath1 to a metallic state below @xmath1 , it is likely that there is a change in the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath0 ) , near @xmath1 .",
    "the change in the dos at @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) is thus ushered in by changing the temperature .",
    "this issue is of fundamental importance as @xmath6 will decide the nature of charge transport in the material .",
    "questions like the existence of a gap in the dos at @xmath0 , localization of states near @xmath0 etc .",
    "are still unresolved .",
    "we formulate the following definite questions which we would like to seek answers to : ( 1 ) is there a finite dos at @xmath0 below @xmath1 i.e. in the metallic state , and if so , whether it has a temperature dependence ? ( 2 ) does a gap open up in the dos near @xmath0 above @xmath1 , i.e. in the paramagnetic insulating state and if so whether it is temperature dependent ?    in this paper",
    "we report our extensive investigations of the dos of these materials as a function of temperature , using variable temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "we have carried out our studies on epitaxial thin films and single crystals of various compositions .",
    "mainly we have studied two systems , namely , la@xmath7ca@xmath8mno@xmath2 epitaxial thin films and single crystals of the system la@xmath3pb@xmath4mno@xmath2 .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath3pb@xmath4mno@xmath2 were grown by the flux method using pbo and pbf@xmath9 as solvents  @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio has been optimized to lower the growth temperature , to combat the high volatility of the flux .",
    "in addition , the heating , soaking and cooling temperatures have been optimized .",
    "the precursors , homogenized in a ball mill , are transferred to a platinum - iridium crucible and closed tightly with a platinum lid .",
    "the growth process is carried out in a cylindrical resistive furnace , controlled by a programmable temperature controller .",
    "the charge is soaked at 1050@xmath10c for 24 hours and slow - cooled in steps of several ramp rates ranging from 0.2 to 1.5@xmath10c / hour to 850@xmath10c , and thereafter furnace - cooled to room temperature .",
    "crystals of typical dimensions 1.5 @xmath11 1.5 @xmath11 1.5 mm@xmath12 are obtained by this method .",
    "the composition of the as - grown crystals are found by edx analysis .",
    "the lead content is varied by changing the charge - to - flux ratio .",
    "single crystals of the compound ( la@xmath13nd@xmath14)@xmath3pb@xmath4mno@xmath2 are grown by a similar method ( this compound will be , hereinafter , referred to as ( ndla)@xmath3pb@xmath4mno@xmath2 , which signifies that the nd and la concentrations are @xmath15 ( 1-x)/2 , for the particular compound studied here ) .",

    "epitaxial films of la@xmath7ca@xmath8mno@xmath2 ( referred as lcmo ) , were prepared by pulsed laser ablation on laalo@xmath2 substrates , using the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resistivity of the samples were measured by four - probe van der pauw method ( for the single crystals ) or four probe linear method ( for the thin film ) .",
    "the magnetoresistance was measured using a superconducting solenoid .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) was done in a home - made variable temperature stm .",
    "the schematic diagram of the stm / s setup is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the stm was operated from 100 k up to 375 k. during the experiment the stm chamber is kept in a cryopumped environment and all other pumps are disconnected from the system .    since we have operated our stm from temperatures up to 375 k and down to 100 k , we have chosen samples having a wide range of @xmath1 to get data for a good range both above and below @xmath1 .",
    "the single crystals surfaces were scraped mechanically to expose a fresh surface before loading it in the stm .",
    "the thin films was cleaned with methanol before loading it in the stm chamber .",
    "mechanically cut pt - rh(13% ) tips were used for all the tunneling experiments .",
    "the samples were baked at about 370 k , in a vacuum of 5 @xmath11 10@xmath17 torr , for 24 hours prior to the stm / s measurements .",
    "the stm chamber was then cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures and the chamber was isolated from the external pumps .",
    "the samples were further baked , at around 340 k , in a cryopumped environment for 5 - 6 hours to avoid condensation of residual gases on the sample surface .",
    "the samples were then imaged at various magnifications and at different temperatures .",
    "the images obtained also served as a test of the cleanliness of the sample surface .",
    "the images were taken in the constant current mode , with the tip bias kept at 1.5 v and the tunneling current , during imaging was stabilized at values ranging from 1 to 2 na ( exact values are specified for the particular images ) .",
    "reproducible images were obtained over long durations indicating that the surfaces were stable and only after obtaining reproducible images , tunneling spectroscopy was carried out .",
    "this ensured the cleanliness of the sample surface before the @xmath18 spectra were recorded .",
    "we found that if gases like nitrogen are made to condense on the surface , most of the features in the @xmath18 curves are washed out and the surface can not be imaged . during data acquisition",
    "no external pumps were used and only the cryopump placed inside the chamber was used to retain the vacuum .    for recording the @xmath18 spectra ,",
    "the tip bias was kept at 1.5 v and the tunneling current ( @xmath19 ) was stabilized at a particular value .",
    "the feedback was then put to hold mode and the tip bias was swept between @xmath20 1 v at a frequency of 6 hz and a set of @xmath18 curves thus obtained , were recorded digitally using a 16 bit ad card .",
    "the gain of the current amplifier is 10@xmath21 v / a and the least count of the ad card is 300 @xmath22v , so the minimum measurable current with this setup is about 3 pa .",
    "the data were recorded at a rate of 7.2 khz .",
    "a set of 5 @xmath18 curves were averaged .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 curves were obtained by numerical differentiation of such average @xmath18 curves .",
    "this procedure was repeated for different values of stabilization currents and at different points on the sample surface , at each temperature .    to determine the exact value of the gaps observed ,",
    "variable distance tunneling measurements were carried out for one sample ( ( ndla)@xmath25pb@xmath26mno@xmath2 ) .",
    "this was done only for positive tip bias ( filled states of the sample ) .",
    "the procedure followed was the same as above except , the tip bias was swept from 0.01 to 2 v instead of @xmath201 v and the feedback was kept in the sample mode . with an active feedback loop the tip went closer to the sample for lower biases , in order to keep the @xmath19 constant .",
    "this gave us a large dynamic range for the measurement of @xmath19 and we were able to measure the correct voltage value for which the @xmath19 goes to zero and hence the correct energy value for the band edges .",
    "for details of this method see ref .",
    "in figure 2 we show the resistivity data of the samples studied .",
    "the materials , as expected , show a peak in @xmath5 at a temperature close to @xmath1 .",
    "we designate this temperature , where the peak in @xmath5 occurs , as @xmath27 .",
    "the resistivities of the single crystals are much less than that of the thin film . however , due to the small size of the crystals , the absolute values of @xmath5 have uncertainties .",
    "the details of the samples are given in table i. some of the quantities were not measured due to experimental limitations , but the essential quantities for our subsequent analyses and conclusions have been measured .",
    "the resistivities are shown in zero field or in an applied field ( 3 or 6 tesla ) .",
    "for the lcmo film the maximum magnetoresistance ( mr ) is in excess of 80 % for an applied field of 6 t. for ( ndla)@xmath25pb@xmath26mno@xmath2 the maximum mr ( at 3 t ) is nearly 70 % .",
    "here we have defined the mr as @xmath28 .",
    "it can be seen from the data on the ( ndla)@xmath25pb@xmath26mno@xmath2 system that the @xmath1 and @xmath27 can be varied over a large temperature range by substituting nd in place of la .",
    "this is expected , because the @xmath1 , in these materials , decreases as the average a - site cation radius ( @xmath29 ) decreases . here a - site refers to the a - site of the abo@xmath2 structure .",
    "substitution of smaller nd in place of la thus leads to the reduction of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows an atomic resolution image obtained for the sample la@xmath30pb@xmath31mno@xmath2 .",
    "the distance between the brighter spots is 4.02 @xmath20 0.2    as derived from our calibration done on graphite .",
    "these materials have a pseudo - cubic structure and the unit cell is nearly cubic or rhombohedral with @xmath32 60.52@xmath33 ( for a perfect cube , @xmath34 = 60@xmath33 ) , as obtained from x - ray structure determination .",
    "the mn - o - mn distance in these materials is around 3.87  .",
    "the distance observed by us is thus close to this distance and the difference can arise due to the uncertainty in calibration .",
    "one may thus argue that the surface exposed has mn - o - mn chains .",
    "however , we have not been able to ascertain , unambiguously , the chemical identity of the imaged atoms . to determine the chemical identity of the atoms , furthers studies involving bias dependent imaging of the surface have to be performed .",
    "we also observe a distortion from the perfect square array , as can be seen from the 4.02 @xmath11 4.02    parallelogram drawn in figure 3 .",
    "figure 4 shows a 853    @xmath11 906    image of the lcmo thin film .",
    "this image shows atomically smooth terraces , which end in atomic level steps as marked by the arrows .",
    "these are typical growth patterns often observed in thin film samples of these oxides  @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath23 @xmath35 curves for two of the samples , la@xmath36pb@xmath37mno@xmath2 single crystal and lcmo thin film . in our subsequent discussions we have referred to these curves . we have shown the data for three distinct regions , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . to avoid overcrowding of data ,",
    "we have shown only a cross - section of the data taken .",
    "the @xmath41 curves , for all the samples , show qualitative variations with temperature , when the temperature is changed across the @xmath1 .",
    "this is obvious directly from the @xmath41 curves . before a detailed discussion of the results , we point out some preliminary observations which can be made from the @xmath41 curves shown above , which are common to all the samples studied . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the @xmath41 curves resemble those for a good metal , like platinum .",
    "there is a finite value of the zero - bias conductance ( @xmath42 ) , and the @xmath41 curves are parabolic .",
    "the parabolic nature of the @xmath41 curves is essentially a property of the tunneling barrier  @xcite .",
    "this is expected as the metallic state is stabilized below @xmath1 . for comparison we show , in figure 6 , the @xmath41 curve for a 500    film of platinum at 307 k. the inset shows the @xmath41 curve for the same film at 134 k. the calculated curves shown in the figure are discussed later in section iv b. the film was grown on a fire - polished glass surface using electron - beam evaporation , in a base pressure of 10@xmath43 torr .",
    "as the temperature is increased to @xmath44 , @xmath42 goes to zero and a gap like feature opens up near zero bias i.e. the fermi level . as the temperature is increased further to @xmath40 , @xmath42 becomes non - zero again and the gap like feature vanishes .",
    "but these @xmath41 curves are qualitatively different from the metal - like @xmath41 curves for @xmath45 .",
    "we will see below that this particular feature of the tunneling data for @xmath40 implies the existence of a soft gap near @xmath0 , with additional contributions to @xmath42 arising due to finite temperature .",
    "the tunneling spectroscopy data as presented in the previous section need to be analyzed quantitatively before further conclusions can be drawn from them .",
    "there are different recipes for obtaining the density of states from tunneling data  @xcite . however , the problem becomes involved if the dos itself is temperature dependent .",
    "this is in addition to the temperature dependence which arises through the fermi function @xmath46 . in the following ,",
    "we have tried to take into account all these effects to derive certain quantitative conclusions about the dos .",
    "we have arranged the following discussion in four subsections , to analyze our data , so that quantitative information about the dos ( @xmath47 ) can be obtained to the extent possible . in the first section",
    "we analyze the data for energy @xmath48 0.2 ev which is the region away from @xmath0 so that the overall temperature dependence of @xmath47 can be obtained . in the second section",
    "we analyze the @xmath47 near the @xmath0 for the ferromagnetic region ( @xmath38 ) . in the third section",
    "we analyze the data for temperatures near the transition temperature @xmath1 ( @xmath44 ) . in the fourth section",
    "we have investigated the region close to @xmath0 , for the paramagnetic regime ( @xmath40 ) .      in this section",
    "we discuss the features in the dos for @xmath48 0.2 ev . figure 7 shows the @xmath51 curves for different temperatures , for some of the samples studied .",
    "@xmath52 is the normalized conductivity @xmath53 .",
    "this quantity is generally used as a measure of the dos , independent of the barrier parameters  @xcite .",
    "the division of the differential conductance @xmath54 by @xmath55 reduces the effect of the barrier parameters . within certain limits",
    "@xmath52 does give a measure of the dos  @xcite .",
    "this quantity @xmath56 is not well - defined near zero - bias , when there is a gap like feature in the dos ( low @xmath42 ) near the fermi level  @xcite . due to this limitation",
    "we have calculated @xmath52 outside the region of very low @xmath42 ( @xmath57 0.2 v ) , from the observed data .",
    "the tunneling spectra for the low bias region will be discussed in the following sections . from figure 7",
    "we conclude that the dos for @xmath48 0.2 ev changes dramatically with temperature , when the temperature is changed across @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior shown in figure 7(a ) is a typical example . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the dos has a stronger dependence on energy , on both the filled ( @xmath58 ) and unfilled ( @xmath59 ) side than that for @xmath40 .",
    "also the temperature dependence of @xmath56 saturates for @xmath60 0.75 , as shown in the inset of figure 7(b ) where we have shown an example for la@xmath30pb@xmath31mno@xmath2 , which has a @xmath61 400 k ( we could not measure @xmath1 due to experimental limitations , however , the @xmath27 = 401 k ) .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath56 at a given voltage @xmath62 volts ( @xmath63 ) is shown in figure 8 to find out the extent of variation in @xmath56 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath62 volts , as it is away from @xmath64 and thus represents states away from @xmath0 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 8 that @xmath63 is higher for @xmath38 than that for @xmath40 ( a preliminary observation has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and similar observations have been reported in ref .",
    "this implies that the dos is higher in value for @xmath38 , in this energy range , and it has a distinct temperature variation as t changes through @xmath1 . eventually , for @xmath65",
    ", a temperature independent value is obtained .",
    "this was seen before in the inset of figure 7(b ) .",
    "the behavior seen in figure 8 has two noteworthy features .",
    "first , there is a distinct peak in @xmath63 at @xmath44 .",
    "this is    seen in all the samples .",
    "second , the peak is sharper for the single crystal than for the thin film .    for @xmath44 ,",
    "a gap like feature is present in the dos near @xmath0 and this results in a very sharp increase in the dos beyond a particular voltage .",
    "this is seen in figure 8 as a rapid increase of @xmath63 , close to @xmath1 .",
    "the increase in dos at higher energies ( away from @xmath0 ) , in the temperature range close to @xmath1 where there is a gap at @xmath0 , may imply a transfer of relative spectral weights to higher energies when the gap opens up .      for @xmath38 , there is a finite tunneling conductance at zero bias , @xmath42 .",
    "this is expected since , for @xmath38 , the metallic state is stabilized and",
    "so we conclude that there is a finite dos at @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however @xmath42 also depends on the barrier parameters of the tunnel junction formed between the tip and sample , in addition to @xmath67 ) and the temperature . for tunneling spectroscopy done at variable temperature",
    "it is difficult to ensure the constancy of these parameters .",
    "the usual normalization procedures which remove the effect of the barrier parameters , do not describe the region near zero bias ( i.e. near @xmath0 ) satisfactorily . to remove this dependence on the barrier parameters and also get an estimate of the relative change of @xmath67 ) with temperature , we normalize @xmath42 by the tunneling conductance at 0.9 v ( @xmath68 ) . but @xmath68 itself might have a temperature dependence due to the change in dos with temperature at that energy .",
    "we expect that the variation of @xmath69 , due to the variation of @xmath68 , can be accounted for if the observed temperature dependence of @xmath68 itself , is taken care of by some normalization factor which is independent of the barrier parameters and depends only on the dos at that energy .",
    "therefore , we plot the quantity : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the value of @xmath52 at a sample bias of 0.9 volts and at a temperature @xmath72 .",
    "this quantity is known experimentally and it is independent of the barrier parameters and depends only on the dos at that particular energy at a temperature @xmath72 .",
    "this normalized ratio @xmath73 in equation 1 is thus expected to mostly reflect the variation arising from the temperature variation of @xmath6 .",
    "the plots of @xmath74 for three different samples are shown in figure 9 .",
    "for all the samples @xmath73 shows a rise below @xmath1 ( or @xmath27 ) as the material enters the metallic state and it reaches a temperature independent value at lower temperatures . for the epitaxial film the growth of @xmath74 ( and hence of @xmath6 )",
    "is gradual whereas for the single crystals this rise is rather sharp .",
    "_ these observations would imply that n(e@xmath75 ) grows rapidly below @xmath1 and reaches a temperature independent value , as in a metal .",
    "this is a very important conclusion of our experiment .",
    "_    the observed parabolic shape of the @xmath41 curves and the fact that @xmath73 has a negligible dependence on temperature below @xmath1 indicate that the dos near @xmath0 is flat in the scale of @xmath76 and temperature independent below @xmath1 , just like a metal . to strengthen this conclusion , quantitatively",
    ", we carried out a simple calculation using the expression for tunneling current given below and a constant dos for both tip and sample .",
    "equation 2 gives the expression for the tunneling current for a trapezoidal barrier  @xcite : @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\tilde{t}(s , e , w)de \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the barrier penetration factor @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the energy of the electron , @xmath81 is a constant dependent on the tip - sample effective junction area , @xmath82 is the tip - sample distance , @xmath83 is the average work function of the tip and sample surface , @xmath84 is the bias between tip and sample , @xmath72 is the temperature , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the tip and sample dos respectively , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the electron mass ) and @xmath46 is the fermi function at temperature @xmath72 . in the above expression all the energies are measured w.r.t .",
    "@xmath0 which is the zero of the energy scale .",
    "figure 10(a ) shows a comparison between an experimental @xmath41 curve , taken on the lcmo thin film at 160 k ( @xmath38 ) , and a calculated @xmath41 curve using constant tip and sample dos , a tip - sample distance of 6.5    and a work function of 1.2 ev .",
    "the good agreement between the observed data and the calculated curves , supports our conclusion that below @xmath1 , the dos near and at @xmath0 is finite and metal - like . for comparison ,",
    "the experimental and calculated @xmath41 curves ( using again a constant tip and sample dos and equation 2 ) for a 500    platinum film are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the change in conductivity ( @xmath89 ) below @xmath1 will arise from a change in the mobility ( @xmath22 ) and/or a change in the carrier concentration ( @xmath90 ) [ @xmath91 .",
    "the increase in @xmath22 below @xmath1 is expected due to the suppression of the spin disorder scattering as the local magnetization builds up .",
    "however , if @xmath6 rises rapidly below @xmath1 , and builds up from a zero value at @xmath1 , it is expected that the effective carrier concentration @xmath90 also rises as the sample is cooled below @xmath1 . _ the large variation in @xmath5 near @xmath1 ,",
    "may be a consequence largely of a variable @xmath6 , giving rise to a large variation in @xmath90 , with a lesser contribution coming from the temperature dependent mobility @xmath92 .",
    "_      for @xmath44 , the value of @xmath42 , goes to zero and a gap opens up in @xmath47 near @xmath0 , as is evident from the @xmath41 curves shown in figure 5 and the plot of @xmath74 vs. @xmath72 shown in figure 9 .",
    "the gap ( @xmath94 ) is shown for one @xmath41 curve in figure 5 .",
    "on heating from below @xmath1 this gap opens at @xmath1515 - 20 k below @xmath27 ( or @xmath1 ) and sharply rises to the maximum value .",
    "we denote the temperature where the gap opens as @xmath95 .",
    "it then decreases in magnitude as the temperature is increased further above @xmath1 and finally disappears as the temperature is increased well beyond @xmath1 and the observed @xmath42 becomes non - zero .",
    "these observations would indicate that close to @xmath1 a gap develops in the dos near @xmath0 .",
    "this gap collapses as the sample is cooled below @xmath1 .",
    "the nature of the dos near @xmath0 for @xmath96 will be discussed later .",
    "these features are observable both in the epitaxial film and single crystals . however , the transitions are sharper for the single crystals .",
    "there is also a very interesting similarity between @xmath95 and the temperature where the mr of the material shows a peak",
    ". it will be interesting to see if such large mr actually arises due to such drastic changes in dos on the application of a magnetic field , when the sample temperature is near @xmath1 . in figure 11",
    "the maximum values of the gaps ( @xmath97 ) observed in different materials have been plotted against the @xmath1 ( or @xmath27 ) of the materials .",
    "it is clear that the observed @xmath97 has a strong correlation with the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 s of these materials are related to the bandwidths . _",
    "a material with larger bandwidth has a larger @xmath1 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath97 as @xmath1 increases would imply that @xmath97 decreases as the bandwidth increases .",
    "this is an important conclusion .",
    "_ this also shows that any mechanism that can change the bandwidth , will change the value of @xmath97 and hence the transport properties close to @xmath1 .",
    "eventually , for @xmath98 400 k ( as in materials like la@xmath36sr@xmath37mno@xmath2 ) the gap is expected to reduce to extremely small values .",
    "interestingly , the largest @xmath1 observed in these materials is around 400 - 450 k. these values of the gaps , measured by tunneling , are comparable to the transport activation gap in these materials , as estimated from the @xmath5 vs. @xmath72 data , which are @xmath15 0.1 ev ( see table i ) .",
    "to verify that the gap is real i.e. the current actually goes to zero within the gap region , we carried out variable separation tunneling spectroscopy , as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this technique",
    ", the tip is brought closer to the sample as the bias between the tip and sample and consequently @xmath19 approaches zero ( the particular method used is described in brief in section ii ) .",
    "this gives a high dynamic range in the measurement of the tunneling current .",
    "this method enables us to effectively measure tunneling currents over a few orders of magnitude , so that we can properly define the band - edges .",
    "although we have not converted the variable distance measurements to constant distance measurements , our purpose , of verifying the band - edges , is still served from just the as- acquired data . this experiment was done only for positive tip bias i.e. for the filled states of the sample .",
    "therefore we were able to observe the band - edge only for the filled states of the sample .",
    "figure 12 shows the variable distance conductance ( @xmath99 ) data , and it shows the gap feature , denoted by @xmath100 , just like the constant distance tunneling data .",
    "the experiment was done at 270 k and the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( at @xmath102 270 k ) , agree to within 0.01 ev .",
    "this combination of the two techniques gives a quantitative foundation to the observed gap .",
    "above @xmath1 , the gap near @xmath0 closes again and @xmath104 assumes a finite value .",
    "this implies , essentially , appearance of finite dos at @xmath0 .",
    "however the transport in the material is still activated .",
    "this is possible only if the new states arising close to @xmath0 are localized .",
    "we have to interpret our tunneling data carefully since , at such high temperatures , the temperature itself plays an important role in determining the shape of the @xmath41 curves .",
    "however , we have carried out numerical calculations again using equation 2 , to find out if the observed disappearance of the gap at high temperatures is due to the thermal smearing of the tunneling spectra , and _ have found that the disappearance of the gap can not be explained due to the thermal smearing alone_. in order to explain our tunneling data for @xmath40 we have to make the following proposition .",
    "we propose that the gap which developed near @xmath0 for @xmath105 , collapses to a soft , coulomb gap for @xmath40 .",
    "the presence of a soft , coulomb gap suggests that the states around @xmath0 are localized .",
    "one then has an interplay of coulomb interaction and disorder .",
    "however , further investigation is required before issues like the existence of a coulomb gap can be established beyond doubt . at this moment",
    "we can only state that using the above model , we can fit our data quantitatively .",
    "however , we can not guarantee that this is the only way to explain the data . in the following ,",
    "we describe the model calculations which were carried out to determine the nature of the dos for @xmath40 .    in figure 10(b ) , we show the comparison of the experimental @xmath41 curve taken at 328 k ( i.e. for @xmath96 ) for the lcmo thin film sample , with the calculated @xmath41 curves ( using equation 2 ) at that temperature .",
    "the dotted line shows the calculated curve using a constant dos for the tip and sample .",
    "the tunneling distance and the work function were taken as 2.5    and 1.2 ev respectively .",
    "this can be taken as the background voltage dependence of @xmath106 for the tunnel junction , due to just the barrier parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "but unlike for @xmath38 , the measured @xmath41 curve dips below the calculated constant dos curve for @xmath107 0.4 volts , therefore suggesting that there is a dip in the dos near the fermi level for @xmath108 0.4 ev . also , there is a significant asymmetry in the measured @xmath41 curve .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath41 curve using the model dos , shown in the inset of figure 10(b ) , for the sample and a constant dos for the tip in equation 2 and the same barrier parameters used for the constant dos calculation , for the bias region @xmath109 0.4 .",
    "the model dos is taken as a quadratic function of @xmath110 .",
    "the value of the model dos is non - zero at @xmath0 ( which was required for a good match with our experimental data ) , unlike a coulomb gap .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the dos , in the presence of a coulomb gap , has an explicit temperature dependence which results in a change in the width of the coulomb gap as well as a non - zero value for the dos at @xmath0 , at such high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath41 curve using this model dos is shown as the solid line in figure 10(b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tunneling distance estimated from the @xmath41 curves for @xmath38 ( about 6.5  ) is much larger than that estimated from the @xmath41 curves for @xmath40 ( about 2.5  ) .",
    "this could again be a consequence of the fact that the states near @xmath0 are localized for @xmath40 .",
    "the asymmetry in the experimental @xmath41 curves for @xmath40 , is reproduced , to a certain extent , by our calculation using the model dos .",
    "therefore from the analysis given above , we conclude that for @xmath40 a coulomb ( soft ) gap is formed at @xmath0 .",
    "to summarize , our experiment suggests that the hard gap existing close to @xmath1 , closes at a temperature somewhat higher than @xmath1 and gives way to a soft gap with localized states near @xmath0 .",
    "this is an important observation .",
    "however , more experiments are needed to confirm the above picture .",
    "from the tunneling studies carried out and the discussion in the above sections , it is clear that the density of states of hole doped manganites show large changes near @xmath0 , when the temperature is changed across @xmath1 .",
    "this plays an important role in determining the transport properties , like resistance and magnetoresistance , of these materials . when the temperature is changed across @xmath1 ,",
    "there is a transfer of spectral weight in the dos .",
    "below @xmath1 the metallic state is stabilized and there is a finite dos near @xmath0 , which is flat in the scale of @xmath76 .",
    "when the temperature is increased from below @xmath1 , a gap appears in the dos near @xmath0 , just below @xmath1 .",
    "the value of this gap is comparable to the transport gap , estimated from the resistivity data above @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum value of this gap is higher for the samples with lower @xmath1 .",
    "it may happen that , if near @xmath1 the applied magnetic field modifies this feature of the dos near @xmath0 , then this will be reflected as a large change in @xmath5 and can thus be the origin of cmr in these materials .",
    "our experiment suggests that , on heating much above @xmath1 , the hard gap gives way to a soft gap near @xmath0 , indicating that the states near @xmath0 are localized .",
    "opening up of a hard gap can arise from jahn - teller effect whereas , a soft gap arises from coulomb interactions for localized states .",
    "our data suggest that there is a presence of both these factors above @xmath1 , modifying the nature of dos .        currently on lien to : national physical laboratory , dr . k.s .",
