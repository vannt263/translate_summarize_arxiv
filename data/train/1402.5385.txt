    "we denote by @xmath6 the invariant hilbert scheme of alexeev and brion @xcite corresponding to the triple @xmath7 ; see section [ sec ihs ] for more details .",
    "this is a quite thrilling and somewhat mysterious object , and there is a large number of articles dedicated to its study . it has rendered services to the classification theory of spherical varieties ; see @xcite for an overview and further references .",
    "moreover , in many cases the invariant hilbert scheme furnishes a canonical candidate for a resolution of singularities of the categorical quotient @xmath8^g)$ ] .",
    "indeed , if we take @xmath9 the hilbert function of the general fibers of the quotient morphism @xmath10 ( see section [ sec ihs ] for the precise definition of @xmath11 ) , then we have the so - called _ hilbert - chow morphism _",
    "@xmath12 , which is a projective morphism that maps a unique irreducible component @xmath13 of @xmath14 , the so - called _ main component _ ,",

    "it is difficult to get control about the invariant hilbert scheme in a hands - on way .",
    "it has been described only in some very special situations where @xmath14 was generally first shown to be smooth by some ad hoc arguments .",
    "examples where @xmath9 can be found in the references mentioned above , and examples where @xmath17 takes values in @xmath18 can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath14 is singular , explicit descriptions of examples as well as a general strategy to describe the singularities were missing so far .",
    "the goal of this article is to describe an algorithm which provides zariski - local equations of @xmath14 at an arbitrary point ; see section [ section algorithm ] and in particular algorithm [ algo main ] .",
    "this is , in some sense , the strongest form of information that one can have about a scheme . to achieve this",

    "[ cas3 ] @xmath29 acting on @xmath30 ( section [ caso3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath0 be as in situation [ cas1 ] or [ cas2 ] , and let @xmath9 be the hilbert function of the general fibers of the quotient morphism @xmath31 .",
    "then the main component of the invariant hilbert scheme is smooth , and thus the hilbert - chow morphism @xmath32 is a resolution of singularities . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath14 is reduced , connected , and the union of two irreducible components @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is smooth in situation [ cas1 ] but singular in situation [ cas2 ] .",
    "moreover , we give a description of the special fiber @xmath35 , both as an abstract scheme as well as in terms of the @xmath1-stable ideals that it parametrizes . even in the case where we do not succeed to describe the invariant hilbert scheme completely",
    ", our algorithm proves helpful .",
    "we obtain the following information in situation [ cas3 ] :    let @xmath1 and @xmath0 be as in situation [ cas3 ] , and let @xmath9 be the hilbert function of the general fibers of the quotient morphism @xmath10 .",
    "then the invariant hilbert scheme @xmath14 is connected and has at least two irreducible components .",
    "we give more detailed formulations of these results in the sections [ hclasssongeneral ] and [ two others ] .",
    "these examples have entered the focus by the work @xcite because they were the first examples with classical groups acting on classical representations where the invariant hilbert scheme was known to be singular . however , this was shown simply by calculating the dimension of the tangent space and comparing it to the dimension of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , no further properties of @xmath14 such as reducibility , or the smoothness of the main component @xmath13 , were given .",
    "our results also show that the geometry of the invariant hilbert scheme can be very diverse .",
    "thus , it is important to have many more examples , and our algorithm gives a powerful tool to calculate them .",
    "let us explain how we obtain these results .",
    "the strategy is to _ localize _ geometric properties of @xmath14 in special points and then to compute local equations at these points via algorithm [ algo main ] .",
    "the question is : which points in @xmath14 contain most information and how do we find them ? in situations [ cas1 ] to [ cas3 ] , there is each time an algebraic subgroup @xmath36 acting on @xmath14 .",
    "imagine that we want to study the singular locus @xmath37 for example .",
    "clearly , @xmath38 is closed and @xmath39-stable . as @xmath12 is projective ,",
    "also @xmath40 is closed and @xmath39-stable , hence it contains a closed @xmath39-orbit . in situations [ cas1 ] to [ cas3 ] , there is only one closed orbit for the @xmath39-action on @xmath15 , and it consists in a single point , say @xmath41 .",
    "the crucial argument is that now borel s fixed point theorem implies the existence of fixed points in the projective scheme @xmath42 for any borel subgroup @xmath43 .",
    "this technique of localizing borel fixed points of @xmath14 obviously applies to many other geometric properties such as non - reducedness or reducibility .",
    "moreover , these fixed points can be calculated by hand in many examples . in our case",
    ", there are two fixed points each in situations [ cas2 ] and [ cas3 ] , and a single one in situation [ cas1 ] .",
    "this stipulates the following general strategy :    1 .",
    "[ find fp ] find the fixed points for the @xmath44-action on @xmath14 .",
    "2 .   [ connect fp ] try to connect these fixed points to the main component @xmath13 in order to show connectedness .",
    "[ tgt ] determine the tangent space of @xmath14 at these fixed points .",
    "[ step33 ] for each of these fixed points , look for subgroups of @xmath44 isomorphic to @xmath20 and satisfying hypothesis [ hypo weights ] .",
    "( there are such groups for all fixed points in situations [ cas1 ] to [ cas3 ] , except for one fixed point in situation [ cas3 ] . )",
    "[ calculate loc ring at fp ] for every fixed point satisfying hypothesis [ hypo weights ] , calculate an affine open neighborhood in @xmath14 thanks to algorithm [ algo main ] .",
    "steps [ find fp ] , [ connect fp ] , and [ step33 ] are done by hand or by ad hoc methods for each example , steps [ tgt ] and [ calculate loc ring at fp ] are done with a computer algebra system .",
    "a documented macaulay2 file containing all the computations in situations [ cas1 ] to [ cas3 ] is available on the webpage of the authors .",
    "equivariant deformation theory has been studied by rim in @xcite .",
    "this includes the case where @xmath1 acts non - trivially on the base space of the versal deformation .",
    "the difference to our work is that firstly we study embedded and not abstract deformations , and secondly here we study invariant deformation theory , that is , deformations where @xmath1 acts trivially on the base space .",
    "moreover , in our case due to the existence of the invariant hilbert scheme , it is unnecessary to assume the existence of a versal deformation of the underlying variety without group action ( and in fact a versal deformation does not exist in our examples ) .",
    "let us also mention that , when @xmath1 is a finite group and @xmath2 is a finite subscheme , our algorithm seems to be folklore . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath1 is trivial , then the invariant hilbert scheme @xmath14 is a punctual hilbert scheme ; the study of this latter via deformation theory can be found in the first chapters of @xcite for instance .",
    "an example where @xmath45 is the binary tetrahedral group can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , even in the particular setting where @xmath1 is a ( non - trivial ) finite group , we did not find any explanation for the validity of the algorithm .",
    "that is why we include a full treatment there .",
    "the text is structured as follows . in section [ sec generalities ]",
    "we recall some basics about the invariant hilbert scheme and the reynolds operator .",
    "section [ sec defo ] is the heart of this paper .",
    "there we develop an invariant deformation theory , which we present in a constructive way .",
    "our algorithm can be deduced rather immediately from the presentation of the theoretical results .",
    "we summarize it in a completely algorithmic fashion in section [ section algorithm ] . in section [ subsec gm action ]",
    "we add hypothesis [ hypo weights ] on the positivity of weights , and deduce its theoretical consequences . in particular",
    ", there we give the argument for the stop condition of our algorithm , which is formulated in an algorithmic way in section [ subsec stop ] .",
