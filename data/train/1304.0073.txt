    "there exist some possible cases that the single millisecond pulsar can be formed due to the evaporation of companion by the millisecond pulsar radiation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kluzniak et al . 1988 ) ) .",
    "direct supporting of the millisecond pulsar spin - up model has been found , for instance , the accreting x - ray millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 is discovered in low mass x - ray binary system ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) ) , and double pulsars psr0737 - 3039a / b are found with one millisecond pulsar and a normal pulsar ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van den heuvel 2004 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lyne 2004 ) ) . the spin - up line in fig.1",
    "is also called the equilibrium spin period line ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) ) , which expresses the relationship between the magnetic field and the spin period , when a neutron star is spun up to the kepler orbital period at the magnetosphere radius .",
    "the equation of the spin - up line can be written as : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the `` equilibrium '' spin period , @xmath7 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the accretion rate , @xmath10 is the maximum possible `` eddington - limit '' accretion rate ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the stellar radius in units of @xmath13 cm and @xmath14 is the neutron star mass .",
    "let the accretion rate be @xmath11 and @xmath15 in the spin - up line equation , there will be two spin - up lines as shown in fig.[bpsr186 ] . with the 186 binary pulsars given in the figure",
    ", it can be seen that almost all of the binary pulsars are above the spin - up line with the accretion rate @xmath15 . however , there are three exceptions : j0514 - 4002a , j1801 - 3210 and j1518 + 4904 .",
    "these three binary pulsars lie below the spin - up line with @xmath16 , which correspond to the inferred accretion rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "thus from the distribution of the binary pulsars in fig.1 , it can be suggested that @xmath15 is a critical minimum accretion rate for the millisecond pulsar formation .",
    "the real ages of millisecond pulsars have not yet been satisfactorily determined , although their characteristic ages can be as long as the hubble time . during the millisecond pulsar spin - up evolution , the maximum critical accreting mass for a millisecond pulsar to reach the spin period of several milliseconds is about @xmath19 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zhang , wang & zhao et al .",
    "2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wang , zhang & zhao et al .",
    "2011 ) ) , and the time of spinning - up should be less than the hubble age of about @xmath20 .",
    "thus , a critical mass accretion rate for a millisecond pulsar formation can be evaluated by @xmath21 if the accretion rate is much lower than this critical value , the neutron star should have no chance to accrete sufficient mass to be spun - up to a spin period of several milliseconds .",
    "[ bpsr186 ] , @xmath15 and the death line , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]",
    "the 186 binary pulsars in the b - p diagram show us that almost all binary pulsars lie above the minimum spin - up line with @xmath16 . in theory",
    ", it can also be deduced that with the maximum accretion mass within hubble time in binary system , the accretion rate will be @xmath22 .",
    "if the accretion rate is lower than that value , a pulsar in the binary system will have no chance to become a millisecond one even with the maximum accretion mass during the evolution .",
    "so , it can be conclude that @xmath16 is the minimum rate for the millisecond pulsar formation in the binary system .",
