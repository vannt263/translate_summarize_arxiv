    "a rapid progress in kerr - lens mode - locking technique allows to reach 14 and 12-fs pulse durations in cr : lisgaf and cr : lisaf lasers , respectively  @xcite .",
    "these active media are attractive due to possibilities of sub-20 fs pulse generation directly from the diode - pumped laser . at the same time , the lasers demonstrate a significant stokes shift of the pulse spectrum at such short pulsewidths  @xcite .",
    "this shift decreases the accessible bandwidth due to the worse overlap of the gain and the pulse spectra , thus setting a limit to pulse duration  @xcite .",
    "therefore , investigation of the nature of the ultrashort pulse spectrum transformation has not only academic but also practical significance .    a number of explanations for the ultrashort pulse spectrum shift in mode - locked lasers have been suggested .",
    "for example , it was supposed , that due to the high - order dispersions the spectral region of negative group - delay dispersion , which is optimal for pulse formation , may be displaced  @xcite .",
    "however in the framework of the perturbation theory the third - order dispersion does not contribute to the pulse carrier frequency , but results in spectrum asymmetry and fragmentation  @xcite . only in the case of the non - steady - state operation",
    "there is a possibility for the strong dynamic frequency shift  @xcite .",
    "a more realistic explanation of the frequency shift takes into account frequency filtering due to reabsorption in the gain medium  @xcite .",
    "however , as it will be shown below , this explanation can not explain the dependence of the frequency shift on the pulse energy .",
    "moreover , such dependence suggests that a nonlinear mechanism is involved in the frequency shift .    as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stimulated raman scattering in active medium is a very suitable nonlinear process , which can produce the experimentally observed stokes frequency shift in sub-50 fs domain .",
    "the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was based on the soliton perturbation theory that did not allow to take into account the effect of high - order dispersion and frequency - dependent dissipative lasing factors such as asymmetric gain band , spectral filtering on the output mirror , reabsorption in the gain medium and gain saturation .    in this work",
    "we performed a numerical analysis of the spectral characteristics of ultrashort pulses on the basis of a relatively simple model of the kerr - lens mode locking ( klm ) .",
    "the main advantages of our model is taking into consideration of the high - order dispersion , exact profiles of the loss and gain bands , frequency dependent reabsorption in the active medium , gain saturation and fast absorber action of the kerr - lensing .",
    "the obtained results are in a good agreement with experimental data and allow to estimate the contribution of the different factors to spectral characteristics of ultrashort pulses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first a summary of relevant measurements and experimental results is given , followed by the construction of the analytical and computational models .",
    "we then present the results of our calculations and discuss the influence of each of the abovementioned factors separately .",
    "finally , we present the results of simulation with all factors included , using distributed and discrete - element models .",
    "systematic stokes shift of the ultrashort modelocked pulse in cr : lisgaf- and cr : lisaf - based klm oscillators has been first reported in 1997  @xcite , where the stimulated raman scattering has been suggested as a possible mechanism .",
    "it has been found , that i ) the shift could be observed in oscillators with different dispersion characteristics , ii ) the shift increases with the pulse energy , and iii ) the shift increases with pulse shortening . at pulse durations below 20 fs ,",
    "the peak of the pulse spectrum may shift as far as 50 - 70 nm into the infrared as compared to the cw wavelength or modelocked spectrum at long pulse durations ( @xmath2840 nm in cr : lisgaf )  @xcite .",
    "later , analogous shifts in cr : lisaf have been reported by uemura and torizuka  @xcite and r. gbel _ et al _",
    "all mentioned experiments used the common optical scheme , differing only in pump arrangements and dispersion compensation techniques .",
    "the schematic diagram of the laser oscillator is shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "this is a representative scheme for any x - shaped klm laser , because different types of dispersion compensation can always be represented by lumped dispersion of a chirped mirror . for modeling purposes we used the parameters of experiments , reported in refs .",
    "@xcite : the brewster - angled 4 mm long lisgaf crystal doped with 1.4% cr , beam diameter in cr : lisgaf crystal 40@xmath360  @xmath4 m .",
    "the high reflectors ( hr ) had negligible dispersion",
    ". the dispersion of the chirped mirrors ( cm ) has been calculated from its original design , and additionally measured by white - light interferometry .",
    "the intracavity dispersion was calculated using the dispersion data of cr : lisgaf  @xcite , measured dispersion curves of the chirped mirrors and calculated dispersion of the output coupler ( fig .",
    "[ dispfig ] ) .",
    "we also used the experimental loss spectra ( mirror transmission and ground - state absorption in cr : lisgaf ) as shown in fig .",

    "the resonator was slightly asymmetric , with distances between the curved mirrors ( radii of curvature 100  mm ) and end mirrors being 88 and 109  cm , corresponding to 72  mhz pulse repetition rate .",
    "modelocking has been achieved primarily by the hard aperture in form of an adjustable slit close to the output coupler ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "[ exshift ] shows normalized output spectra at different pulse peak power , demonstrating the spectral shift .",
    "similar spectral behaviour has been observed also in cr : lisaf oscillators .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity we provide experimental data and perform simulations on cr : lisgaf only .    the raman gain spectrum of undoped lisgaf crystal has been measured according to the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the orientated crystalline quartz as a reference , and taking into account the thermal phonon population factor .",

    "is polarized along the @xmath7 axis , corresponding to the polarization of light in the laser .",

    "[ shifts ] by the dashed lines @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the letters alongside of squares , circles and triangles denote the intracavity pulse energy obtained from the numerical simulation ( see table  [ energies ] ) .",
    "the pulse energy variation results from the change of modulation parameter @xmath15 , i.e. due to the change of the cavity configuration .",
    "the curve @xmath13 illustrates the case when there is no reabsorption and raman scattering in the active medium .",
    "the dependence of frequency shift on pulse energy is not monotonous : at the minimum pulse width ( 15 fs in our case ) there is no stokes frequency shift , contradicting the experimental data .",
    "moreover , the maximal shift ( of about 6 nm ) is by an order of magnitude less than that observed in the experiment .",
    "it is clear , that gain band asymmetry and output loss alone can not produce large self - frequency shift in cr : lisgaf laser .",
    "stronger contribution is provided by the reabsorption in the active medium ( curve @xmath14 on fig .",
    "[ shifts ] ) . for small energies",
    "the simulation result ( point _ e _ on fig .",
    "[ shifts ] ) coincides with the prediction made on the basis of elementary model of net - gain maximum shift ( solid curve ) .",
    "the rise of the pulse energy increases the shift ( up to 25 nm in our case ) , much more than in the previous case , although still by a factor of two less than in the experiment .",
    "note , that after certain pulse energy the spectral shift is again decreasing .",
    "this is caused by the increase of the pulse duration for the large energies ( point _ h _ on fig .",
    "[ shifts ] ) , due to the nonlinear loss saturation , resulting in reduced spectrum width .",
    "the laser approaches the condition of the cw operation , described by solid curve ( although the conditions of pulsed gain saturation strongly differ from those in cw - regime ) .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the net - gain shift model fails to provide correct description of the experimental data by a factor of two .",
    "however , taking the stimulated raman scattering into account allows to obtain large frequency shifts , increasing with pulse energy growth . in fig .",
    "[ shifts ] the curve @xmath16 demonstrates the raman scattering action in the absence of reabsorption effect .",
    "as the simulation demonstrates , the red components originate from the amplified raman signal , which pulls the whole spectrum over the long wavelength limit at the given pump power , defined by the spectral filtering .",
    "note the pronounced threshold - like character of the effect .",
    "for the small energies ( point @xmath17 ) the spectral shift is negligible , but the energy growth causes very strong shift ( 60 nm in our case ) in good agreement with experimental results  @xcite and with analytical prediction  @xcite . since the gain saturation does not play important role in this case , the dependence of frequency shift on gain coefficient is insignificant .",
    "as already mentioned above , the main contribution to the stimulated raman process comes from the energy transfer from the blue part of the pulse spectrum ( pump ) to the red one ( stokes ) .",
    "the efficiency of the stimulated raman scattering is therefore defined by the product of intensities at pump and stokes frequencies .",
    "the separation between stokes and pump components is fixed , it is equal to the raman line frequency @xmath18 . therefore , decreasing the pulse spectrum width strongly suppresses the effect and reduces self - frequency shift . assuming that the pulse spectrum has exponential fall - off to the blue and red sides",
    ", we see that the dependence of the raman shift on the pulse spectrum width should be asymptotically exponential at long pulse durations .",
    "this is also the result of the analytical theory in ref  @xcite , where sech@xmath19 pulse shape has been assumed .",
    "as the raman effect strongly depends on the pulse intensity and raman gain , it should be especially pronounced in low - gain lasers working with low output coupling and high intracavity pulse energy , such as cr : lisgaf , cr : lisaf , cr : yag .",
    "these materials also possess strong and broad raman lines  @xcite .",
    "large power - dependent red - shift in cr : lisgaf and cr : lisaf is well documented  @xcite . in femtosecond",
    "cr : yag lasers , femtosecond pulse spectrum is also always red - shifted with respect to the cw wavelength in the same resonator  @xcite .",
    "finally , we can compare the simulation results in case of distributed and discrete - element models . in the case of the high - order dispersion action",
    "the transition to the distributed - element model does not significantly change the spectral characteristics of the pulse ( the dot curve in fig .",
    "[ dcurves ] , _ b _ ) . the long - wavelength `` shoulder '' of the spectrum in the case of the net dispersion corresponding to solid curve in fig .",
    "[ dcurves ] _ a _ is somewhat stronger than in the distributed model .",
    "this is because this `` shoulder '' results from local dispersion maximum due to the chirped mirror ( cm@xmath20 on fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) , which is the closest to the output mirror .",
    "additionally , the self - phase modulation contribution is found to be slightly higher in comparison to the distributed model .",
    "however , all these changes are not qualitative .",
    "we found also that the transformation of the spectrum on each laser elements is small ensuring the validity of the distributed model .",
    "it should also be noted , that the transition from the distributed to the discrete model slightly increases the contribution of the raman scattering , seen by the lower threshold energy .",
    "using the numerical simulations performed in the framework of one - dimensional distributed and discrete - element models , we analysed the spectral characteristics of a cw kerr - lens mode - locked cr : lisgaf - laser .",
    "the two main factors causing the ultrashort pulse self - frequency shift have been established : the nonlinear shift of the net - gain band due to the gain saturation in the presence of reabsorption in the active medium and the stimulated raman scattering .",
    "the first effect is essential for comparatively small pulse energies and produces wavelength shifts up to 30 nm .",
    "the raman scattering occurs as a result of pulse energy growth and causes the large ( over 50 nm ) red shift .",
    "the contribution of the high - order dispersion ( up to the eighth order ) , gain - band asymmetry and spectral characteristics of output coupler were estimated as well .",
    "however , their effect on the pulse central frequency is much smaller than that of the stimulated raman scattering , which is the main cause of spectral red - shift in kerr - lens modelocked laser .",
    "the shift values obtained from the numerical simulations are in good agreement with experimental data .",
