    "non - experts , however , do not automatically imagine and think about these phenomena correctly .",
    "for example , many students find it difficult to picture atoms in _ perpetual _ motion , colliding elastically with no loss of energy over time  even though this picture is essential to understanding how a gas can exert a steady pressure.@xcite physics students gradually learn quantitative approaches to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , but their qualitative understanding can lag behind their symbol - pushing skills .",
    "moreover , at the undergraduate level , the thermal physics curriculum tends to be restricted to a disappointingly narrow range of systems :    * `` ideal '' gases in which the particles do nt attract or repel each other at all ; and/or * systems in equilibrium ( so that the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics applies ) ; and/or * very large systems ( in the `` thermodynamic limit '' ) , for which fluctuations and surface effects are negligible .",
    "of course , these restrictions are usually necessary in order to perform accurate pencil - and - paper calculations .",
    "to study systems that are free of these restrictions , researchers often use molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite in their basic form , these simulations integrate newton s second law numerically to determine the motions of a moderately large number of classical particles . in this approach",
    "there is no difficulty with incorporating forces between the particles , or with studying nonequilibrium states .",
    "simulating very large systems is computationally expensive , so fluctuations and surface effects are necessarily apparent ( for better or for worse ) in practical simulations",
    ".    molecular dynamics is gradually making its way into science education , from two directions .",
    "at the elementary level , there are now simulations with animated graphics that are intended to give precollege students and chemistry students a qualitative understanding of the atomic view of matter , and especially of the differences between solids , liquids , and gases.@xcite meanwhile , at a more advanced level , a growing number of text materials@xcite for computational physics and statistical physics are presenting molecular dynamics template codes and encouraging students to modify them and use them to perform quantitative numerical `` experiments . ''    the purpose of this article is to encourage more widespread use of molecular dynamics simulations in physics instruction at all levels , so that more students will understand the atomic view of matter and learn to apply it , both qualitatively and quantitatively , to a wider variety of phenomena .",
    "there are especially many opportunities to incorporate molecular dynamics simulations into courses in introductory physics and thermal physics . in these courses",
    "the students rarely have time to do their own coding , yet they are ready to appreciate the principles behind a molecular dynamics simulation and , with sufficiently flexible software , to use it to gain solid qualitative understanding and to conduct serious numerical experiments .",
    "software intended for this type of student use does exist,@xcite but it is not widely used and in my opinion there is a need for a greater diversity of software options . in an attempt to partially fill this need ,",
    "i have written an interactive molecular dynamics simulation with animated graphics in html5/javascript , which is provided as an online supplement to this article.@xcite readers may wish to run this simulation while reading the rest of the article . there is no need to view the source code of this simulation , but i have tried to make the code easy for beginning programmers to read , in the hope that curious students will look to see how it works , and in the hope that other instructors will modify and adapt it to fulfill a still wider variety of educational needs .",
    "the next two sections summarize the lennard - jones model that is widely used in molecular dynamics simulations , and discuss some details of implementing the model on a computer .",
    "these sections mostly review material that can readily be found elsewhere , but are included for completeness .",
    "section iv then briefly summarizes some of the qualitative behavior of the simulated lennard - jones system .",
    "section v lists several user interface features that facilitate extensive and open - ended exploration of the system s behavior .",
    "a collection of 20 student exercises is presented in section vi , and further enhancements to a basic molecular dynamics simulation are briefly described in section  vii .",
    "in the simplest molecular dynamics simulations , the model consists of @xmath0 classical , spherically symmetrical particles interacting pair - wise .",
    "a commonly used form for the interaction@xcite is the lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential energy function , @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the distance between the centers of the two particles and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "this function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ lennardjonesplot ] , where we see that the potential reaches a minimum value of @xmath5 at @xmath6 and rises very steeply for @xmath7 .",
    "thus we can think of @xmath3 as a rough measure of the diameter of the particles . the attractive @xmath8 term in eq .",
    "( [ lj ] ) represents the long - range behavior of the van der waals force between uncharged , nonpolar molecules.@xcite there is no good theoretical or experimental basis for the exact form of the repulsive @xmath9 term , which is chosen for computational convenience . in any case",

    "values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are adapted from ref .",
    ", p.  582 .",
    "the @xmath4 values can vary by 10% or more , depending on what experimental data are used to fit the lennard - jones function . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ bosons ]    computational physicists generally use ( with no loss of generality ) a natural system of units in which the lennard - jones parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both equal to  1 , along with the particle mass  @xmath10 and boltzmann s constant  @xmath11 : @xmath12 this article and the accompanying code also use this natural unit system , even though the intent is to reach students who may have never worked physics problems in non - si units . working in natural units and converting between unit systems are essential skills that all scientists and engineers must learn at some point .",
    "still , in some educational settings it will be appropriate to work in more familiar units .",
    "table  i lists some approximate values of lennard - jones parameters that can be used to model different noble gases , including the natural units of temperature ( @xmath13 ) , velocity ( @xmath14 ) , and time ( @xmath15 ) .    to keep the particles from drifting outward indefinitely , a simulation must either use periodic boundary conditions or provide an additional confining force . while the former choice is preferable for many research studies , students find it easier to conceptualize molecules that bounce off of walls.@xcite using walls also offers some other advantages , as described below",
    ".    it would be most natural to model atoms moving in three - dimensional space , and we could then make quantitative comparisons to experimental data for real three - dimensional noble gases and their condensed phases .",
    "however , a two - dimensional simulation can demonstrate most of the important physical principles equally well , and is preferable for many educational purposes .",
    "then the student can see all the simulated atoms at once on a graphical display , and interact with them in a natural way using a mouse or other pointing mechanism .",
    "both graphics and pointing interactions become awkward , though certainly not impossible , with a three - dimensional simulation .",
    "a two - dimensional simulation also typically requires fewer particles , so it can run at a faster animation rate .    in summary",
    ", this article is primarily about two - dimensional dynamical lennard - jones simulations with fixed - wall boundary conditions .",
    "for those who are interested in understanding the computational algorithms of a molecular dynamics simulation , and perhaps coding their own simulations , abundant resources are available.@xcite the following remarks merely provide a brief overview and highlight a few important issues .    to integrate newton s second law for the @xmath0-particle lennard - jones system , a common ( and easy ) approach is to use the velocity verlet algorithm .",
    "the program stores the positions ( @xmath16 ) , velocities ( @xmath17 ) , and accelerations ( @xmath18 ) of the @xmath0 particles , and repeatedly steps these variables forward by small time increments ( @xmath19 ) in the following sequence :    1 .",
    "use the current velocities and accelerations to update all of the positions to second - order accuracy : @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   use the current accelerations to update all of the velocities by half a time step : @xmath21 .",
    "3 .   compute the new accelerations from the updated positions , using the lennard - jones force law ( i.e. , the gradient of eq .",
    "( [ lj ] ) ) .",
    "4 .   use these new accelerations to update the velocities by another half time step : @xmath21 .",
    "( thus , steps 2 and 4 together update the velocities by a full time step to second - order accuracy in a symmetrical way , using the average of the old and new accelerations . )",
    "the simulation will run faster with a larger value of @xmath19 , but this also reduces the accuracy and , worse , can lead to a runaway instability ( exponentially increasing total energy ) if @xmath19 is too large . in practice , @xmath22 ( in natural units ) usually produces good results under the conditions that are of most interest .    the system s total energy can be calculated at any time , using eq .",
    "( [ lj ] ) to calculate the potential energy .",
    "the total energy should be conserved , so monitoring the energy is a good way to check the accuracy of the simulation .",
    "if the system is in thermal equilibrium , then its temperature @xmath23 should be related to the total kinetic energy @xmath24 by the equipartition theorem : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes an average and @xmath27 is the dimensionality of space . in two dimensions , and in units where @xmath28 , the temperature is just the average kinetic energy per particle .",
    "importantly , however , this interpretation is accurate only for systems in thermal equilibrium . as the system evolves from a nonequilibrium state toward an equilibrium state the `` temperature '' ( computed from eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) ) will drift . even after equilibrium is reached , for the relatively small systems ( @xmath29 ) considered here , the instantaneous `` temperature '' will fluctuate significantly and so a time average is needed to obtain an accurate temperature measurement .    with fixed - wall boundary conditions ,",
    "the instantaneous pressure is simply the total force per unit area ( or per unit length in two dimensions ) exerted on ( or by ) the walls .",
    "this too will fluctuate significantly , so a time average is necessary to get a good pressure measurement .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations are computationally intensive , so programmers must pay attention to calculation times and optimization opportunities .",
    "traditionally these simulations are coded in fortran or c , but today it is also feasible to use interpreted languages , such as java or javascript , so long as the interpreter employs just - in - time compilation with good optimization.@xcite on a personal computer it is now fairly easy to simulate and draw 1000 lennard - jones particles at aesthetically pleasing animation rates , and even the current generation of higher - end smartphones and tablets can feasibly simulate and animate hundreds of particles .",
    "the computational bottleneck is in step 3 of the algorithm , which calculates the lennard - jones force between each interacting pair of particles .",
    "the number of pairs is @xmath30 , so the calculation time ( per simulated time step ) grows in proportion to @xmath31 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "programmers using c - derived languages should compute the powers of @xmath2 in the lennard - jones force using repeated multiplication , rather than the much slower `` pow '' function .",
    "another easy optimization is to truncate the lennard - jones interaction at a cutoff of @xmath32 ( in natural units ) , setting both the force and the potential energy to zero beyond the cutoff ( and adding a small constant to the energy within the cutoff , to eliminate the resulting discontinuity ) ; then there is no need to calculate the force for pairs that are separated by more than the cutoff .",
    "the use of a cutoff also makes it possible@xcite to organize the force calculations in such a way that the calculation time grows only in proportion to  @xmath0 rather than  @xmath31 .",
    "any lennard - jones simulation , if it includes graphical output and a way to generate an assortment of initial states , can quickly demonstrate a wide variety of interesting behaviors .",
    ", colored according to speed with lighter colors corresponding to higher speeds.,width=283 ]    figure [ equilibriumpictures ] shows snapshots of several equilibrium states of the two - dimensional lennard - jones system . in each case",
    "the system was simply left to evolve ( with constant energy , volume , and number of particles ) until its macroscopic properties appeared to be stable .",
    "the gas , liquid , and solid phases are readily apparent at suitable densities and temperatures .",
    "the gas phase can be far from ideal , with small clumps of atoms constantly forming and breaking apart . a hexagonal crystal structure spontaneously forms to give the rigid solid phase , but forms only partially , over short distances , in the non - rigid liquid phase .",
    "under many conditions this fixed - volume system will settle into an inhomogeneous mixture , with a condensed crystal or droplet constantly exchanging atoms with a surrounding gas .",
    "at one special density ( about 0.35 particles per unit volume ) and temperature ( about 0.50 ) , density variations occur on all possible length scales ; this is the critical point .",
    "fascinating as these equilibrium states are , however , they are just the beginning . with suitable initialization",
    ", a lennard - jones simulation can also show a huge variety of nonequilibrium states and their subsequent evolution toward equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ nonequilibriumpictures ] shows just a few of the possibilities .    exploring",
    "the evolution of nonequilibrium states can give students a vivid understanding of the arrow of time .",
    "naturally , none of the configurations in fig .  [ nonequilibriumpictures ] will ever recur spontaneously after the system has equilibrated.@xcite an especially instructive exercise is to reverse all the atoms velocities after the system has evolved toward equilibrium for a short time , and observe whether the original nonequilibrium state is restored .",
    "tiny numerical round - off errors , amplified by the chaotic behavior of the system , will almost always set a time limit beyond which the behavior can not be reversed .",
    "chaotic behavior occurs even when there are as few as two atoms , as is easily demonstrated using simple configurations such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ chaoticbouncers ] .",
    "in order to explore configurations like those shown in figs .  [ equilibriumpictures ] through [ chaoticbouncers ] , students must have ways to put the lennard - jones system into a wide variety of initial states .",
    "the easier this process is , the more different behaviors they can discover . directly manipulating the state of the system can also make the simulation more interactive and enjoyable .",
    "of course , there can be good pedagogical reasons to restrict the range of possible configurations , in order to focus students attention on certain phenomena .",
    "for a simulation to come across as more than a mere movie , however , students should be able to carry out at least some of the following actions :    * add and remove atoms .",
    "* change the volume of the container .",
    "* change the system s energy , e.g. , by multiplying all the velocities by a given factor .",
    "* drag an individual atom around and/or pull it with a simulated force , using mouse / pointer / touch interactions .",
    "* reverse the motions of all the atoms . * exert a uniform `` gravity '' force that pulls all the atoms downward . *",
    "save and restore the state of the system . *",
    "edit the detailed numerical position and velocity data , or import data from a spreadsheet .",
    "there are many possible ways to implement each of these features .",
    "for example , the code that accompanies this article@xcite uses a slider to control the number of atoms , inserting each new atom at the first available open space in a grid ; ljfluidapp@xcite instead requires the user to select the number of atoms from a menu before initialization ; atoms in motion@xcite uses buttons to add atoms at random locations one at a time ; virtual molecular dynamics laboratory@xcite uses mouse clicks to place added atoms ; and states of matter@xcite shows a simulated bicycle pump that sprays new atoms into the container .",
    "each of these design choices has its advantages and disadvantages , and these choices can have significant effects on the ways that the simulation will be used .    since the early days of graphical user interfaces",
    ", however , experts have recognized qualities of good interface design that help users feel comfortable with software . among these qualities",
    "are responsiveness , permissiveness , and consistency.@xcite responsiveness means that user inputs produce immediate , rather than delayed , effects , so the user can quickly learn what the controls do .",
    "permissiveness means that the software lets the user perform any reasonable action at any time , rather than imposing arbitrary restrictions,@xcite so the user feels in control of the software rather than the other way around .",
    "and consistency means that user - interface controls are easily recognizable , so the user does nt need to guess at meanings or read lengthy instructions . while some physicists may consider these qualities to be irrelevant to the content of a simulation , for a student they can make the difference between doing the bare minimum to complete an assignment , and actively engaging to explore widely and learn deeply .",
    "if students are to perform quantitative numerical experiments , the user interface must also include data output",
    ". this output can be as simple as pressure and temperature readouts , or as detailed as a complete dump of all the atoms position and velocity values .",
    "the exercises in the following section assume that the software provides a means of collecting the required data.@xcite",
    "the following exercises are designed for use in undergraduate courses at the beginning and intermediate levels .",
    "they illustrate and reinforce the concepts of thermal physics using numerical data for a nontrivial system , and highlight the idealizations ordinarily made in undergraduate courses , often showing when and how these idealizations break down .",
    "some of the exercises could be developed further into advanced projects .",
    "all of these exercises can be carried out using the software that accompanies this article.@xcite some of them can also be done using other existing software , and further software options will undoubtedly become available in the future . in most cases , instructors should supplement the exercises with software - specific instructions for configuring the system and acquiring the needed data.@xcite the exercises use natural units , but could be augmented by asking students to convert results to conventional units ( see table  i ) , or adapted for use with software that uses conventional units .",
    "many of the exercises require that students use a spreadsheet program or other plotting software .    1 .",
    "* basic phase behavior .",
    "* run the simulation under a variety of conditions , adjusting the number of atoms , volume , and energy , and waiting for the system to equilibrate at each setting , until you have produced each of the following states of matter : ( a ) a pure gas , with plenty of space around most atoms and no large clumps ; ( b ) a pure liquid , with little space between atoms but no long - range order ; ( c ) a pure solid , with all the atoms in orderly rows ; ( d ) a liquid droplet surrounded by gas ; ( e ) a solid crystal surrounded by gas .",
    "for each of these states , write down the following data : number of particles , volume ( actually area in two dimensions ) , total energy , kinetic energy , potential energy , temperature , and pressure",

    "a critical yet intrinsic limitation is that these simulations do not incorporate any quantum effects .",

    "other approaches@xcite can be used to introduce students to thermodynamic systems at low temperature , at least when the systems are in equilibrium .",
