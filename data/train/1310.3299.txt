    "this video is a visualization of 490 nm diameter fluorescently labeled ps spheres suspended in a 1 mmol / l sodium tetraborate aqueous solution at a volume fraction of @xmath1 flowing through a fused - silica microchannel ( nominal cross - sectional dimensions of 30 @xmath0 m @xmath2 350 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the visualizations use evanescent - wave illumination generated by the total internal reflection of light at the fused silica - fluid interface , and the exponentially decaying intensity of the illumination ensures that only particles within about 0.5 @xmath0 m of the channel wall are visible in these images .",
    "the first set of video clips shows the near - wall particle dynamics in poiseuille flow at a pressure gradient @xmath3 0.4 bar / m . in this",
    "set , flow goes from left to right , the vertical dimension of the field of view is about 200 @xmath0 m , and the particles ",
    "blink due to brownian diffusion .",
    "the next segment shows what happens to the particle dynamics when an electric field along the streamwise direction of @xmath4 v / cm ( so the anode is upstream , and the cathode is downstream , and the mobile counterions , which are cations , are driven in a direction opposite to the poiseuille flow ) .",
    "more particles are visible , suggesting that the negatively charged particles are attracted to the negatively charged wall .",
    "the next three segments show particle dynamics for poiseuille flow at the same @xmath5 with an electric field @xmath6 v / cm , @xmath7 v / cm and -@xmath8 . at @xmath6 v / cm , even more particles are visible , and the formation of  chains of perhaps @xmath9 particles can be observed . at the two highest values of @xmath10 ,",
    "dense streamwise bands of particles are evident , with a cross - stream dimension of roughly 10 @xmath0 m . at the end of the @xmath11 v / cm clip ,",
    "the electric field is turned off , and the bands disappear within about 15 s.    the next set of video clips shows the bands at a reduced magnification at different streamwise locations at @xmath11 v / cm , where @xmath12 is measured from the bend at the upstream end of the straight section of this microchannel .",
    "flow still goes from left to right , and the entire 350 @xmath0 m cross - stream dimension of the channel is visualized .",
    "this set shows that the bands occur over most of the entire 4 cm length of the channel ; the bands appear to become more defined as @xmath12 increases .",
    "the last set of video clips ( with a vertical dimension of @xmath13 m ) shows that the bands are deflected by obstacles , here debris stuck on the channel wall . as a final note , our previous studies ( cevheri & yoda ( 2013 )  evanescent - wave particle velocimetry studies of combined electroosmotic and poiseuille flow, proceedings of the 10th international symposium on particle image velocimetry ( delft , the netherlands ) ) show that applying a positive electric field to the same dilute particle suspension driven by a poiseuille flow repels the particles from the negatively charged wall ."

    "<S> this fluid dynamics video , presented at the 66th annual meeting of the american physical society division of fluid dynamics ( pittsburgh , pa ) , shows how dielectric colloidal polystyrene ( ps ) particles with a negative surface charge in a dilute suspension flowing through a microchannel can be manipulated and assembled into streamwise structures by using a combination of shear and an applied negative electric field along the streamwise direction . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these structures are only observed within about 1 @xmath0 m of the wall , which also has a negative surface charge , and are not present in the bulk flow . </S>"
