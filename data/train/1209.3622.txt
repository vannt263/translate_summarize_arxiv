    "@xmath0 bosons are a ubiquitous feature of theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) appearing from a variety of concepts such as @xmath1 gauge extensions of the sm motivated by supersymmetry or grand unified theories , kaluza - klein excitations of sm gauge fields or excitations of composite exotic vector mesons in technicolor theories to name a few .",
    "the obvious channel to search for such objects at hadron colliders is drell - yan ( dy ) production of a lepton pair , i.e. , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "the strongest limits on @xmath0 s at both tevatron and the lhc come from this signature .",
    "the tevatron places limits on the @xmath0 mass , @xmath4 , at around 1 tev  @xcite ( for a sequential @xmath0 ) while the latest lhc limits lie around 2.3 tev  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological studies on how to measure the @xmath0 properties and couplings to sm particles in this clean dy channel have been performed .",
    "these proceedings summarise a recently published paper  @xcite addressing the use of the top - antitop final state , i.e. , @xmath5 , to probe these @xmath0 properties .",
    "while it may not have as much ` discovery ' scope as the dy channel , owing to the large qcd background combined with the complex six - body final state and the associated poor reconstruction efficiency , it remains important to extract the couplings of new physics to the top quark .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the top decays before hadronising , transmitting spin information to its decay products , allows for the definition of spin asymmetry observables which provide an extra handle on @xmath0 couplings not present in non - decaying final states .",
    "we study the scope of the lhc to profile a @xmath0 boson mediating @xmath6 production , in both standard kinematic variables as well as spatial / spin asymmetries , by adopting some benchmark scenarios for several realisations of the sequential , left - right symmetric and @xmath7 based @xmath0 models ( specifically , the same as those in accomando _",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the issue of distinguishability of various models using these observables is addressed .",
    "we define the asymmetry observables considered with the aim of determining their power to discriminate between @xmath0s .",
    "we refer the reader to our paper for a more detailed discussion on these as well as the selection of benchmark models , statistical uncertainties and definitions of significance .",
    "this study investigated charge ( spatial ) and spin asymmetries and their dependence on top couplings to profile and distinguish the models considered .    a selection of charge asymmetry variables",
    "were investigated with the most sensitive found to be @xmath8 , defined by the rapidity difference of the top and antitop , @xmath9 , while also cutting on the boost of the @xmath10 system .",
    "this increases the contribution from the @xmath11 initial state by probing regions of higher partonic momentum fraction , @xmath12 , where its parton luminosity is more important : @xmath13 the two spin asymmetries considered , termed double ( @xmath14 ) and single ( @xmath15 ) , are defined as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the number of observed events and its first(second ) argument corresponds to the helicity of the top ( anti)quark .    defining a generic neutral current interaction in terms of gauge , vector and axial couplings @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the feynman rule @xmath21 the asymmetric term in the polar angle of the @xmath0 matrix element ( which contributes to the charge asymmetry ) is proportional to @xmath22 where @xmath23 labels the initial state partons .",
    "the dependence on the chiral couplings of the spin asymmetries can be expressed analytically , using helicity formulas from arai _ et al . _",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath24 for a neutral gauge boson exchanged in the @xmath25-channel , where @xmath26 . these imply that @xmath27 depends only on the square of the couplings similarly to the total cross section and that @xmath28 is only non - vanishing for non - zero vector and axial couplings of the final state tops and is additionally sensitive to their relative sign .",
    "we present a selection of results profiling the spatial and spin asymmetry distributions of the benchmark @xmath29 models compared to the sm including interference effects .",
    "the set of benchmarks are split into two categories : those with a vanishing vector or axial coupling ( the @xmath30 models with the ` b - l ' generalised left - right symmetric model ) are classed as the ` @xmath30 ' type while the rest , with both couplings non - zero , are referred to as the ` generalised models ' .",
    "the variables described in section  [ sec : defcalc ] were computed as a function of the @xmath10 invariant mass within @xmath31 gev and compared to the tree - level sm predictions .",

    "we also show a selection of two bin plots integrating the cross sections over an ` on - peak ' range ( @xmath36 gev ) and evaluating the corresponding partially integrated asymmetry .",
    "overall the figures ( particularly the two bin plots ) show that the majority of benchmark models can be distinguished from one another using these variables , noting in particular the sensitivity of @xmath28 to the relative sign of the vector and axial couplings which allows for a clear distinction between the @xmath37 ( sequential ) and @xmath38 models ( left - right symmetric ) models in the ` generalised ' category .",
    "@xmath27 depends on the couplings in the same way as the total cross section and therefore models that can not be distinguished in the invariant mass spectrum will remain so in this variable .",

    ", the significance between various models is a measure of how well they can be distinguished . in most cases the significances are important ,",
    "showing that this variable would certainly be effective in disentangling the ` generalised ' models with the discrimination decreasing slightly for higher masses .",
    "however we do demonstrate in the paper that the @xmath28 variable is more effective to this end although the observable itself may be more difficult to extract . although not shown in these proceedings , a similar statistical analysis was performed in determining how much integrated luminosity would be required to achieve a significance of 3 between models in the various observables .",
    "we showed that in many cases , the models can be distinguished at the relatively early stages of the lhc ( @xmath39 100 fb @xmath35 at 14 tev ) .",
    "the cases where this is not possible reflect mostly instances where the couplings are too similar and would be difficult to disentangle .",

    "we have presented an overview of a phenomenological study on classes of @xmath29 models in both spin and spatial asymmetries of @xmath10 production and showed that there is much scope to observe deviations from the sm and even distinguish between various models , particularly for spin asymmetries .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath10 channel would certainly be a useful complement to the more popular dy channel in the aim of profiling a @xmath0 resonance should one be observed in the near future .",
    "it is worth noting that the classes of models studied are benchmarks put forward to set bounds on @xmath29 masses best probed in the di - lepton channels .",
    "other models could be better suited to the @xmath10 channel , such as leptophobic / top - phillic @xmath29s occurring in composite / multi - site and extra - dimensional models .",
