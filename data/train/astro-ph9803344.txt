    "the radial inflow of matter produces a shock front above the white dwarf surface which gives rise to hard x - rays and polarized cyclotron radiation in the ir to uv range . in the simplest physical model ( lamb 1985 )",
    "half of this shock radiation intercepts the white dwarf surface and is reradiated as thermal emission from the heated accretion spot in the uv and soft x - ray band .",
    "x - ray observations , most notably with the  satellite , had and have a great impact on the study of magnetic cataclysmic variables .",
    "the rather high intensity , strongly variable and soft x - ray emission allows to set up selection criteria ( e.g. using the  data base ) with a high detection / identification rate which reflects in the fact that about 80% of all magnetic cataclysmic variables have been discovered at x - ray wavelengths ( beuermann 1998 ) .    during the search for supersoft x - ray sources in the  ( trmper 1983 ) all - sky - survey ( rass ) , we have found a bright x - ray source showing strong scan - to - scan variability in the x - ray count rate as measured in the pspc .",

    "the x - ray spectrum of 18   ( fig .",

    "in addition to this soft component there is faint but detectable hard emission ( above 0.5 kev ) which could be explained by the usual bremsstrahlung emission of am her variables .",
    "the temperature of this bremsstrahlung component can not be confined with our spectra ( fig .",

    "we have plotted the folded light curve in three distinct energy ranges ( fig .",
    "[ foldlc3 ] ) : ( i ) in channels 1020 , mostly affected by absorption effects , ( ii ) in channels 3055 , the part of the blackbody flux not affected by interstellar absorption and ( iii ) channels 55235 , the high - energy part of the  spectrum which is dominated by the hard , bremsstrahlung component .",
    "two main characteristics are obvious : first , there is no great difference between the two soft panels except the relative depth of the intensity dips , suggesting that intrinsic absorption of soft x - ray photons plays only a minor role in the x - ray modulations outside of the dips .",
    "second , the main intensity peak in soft x - rays is not accompanied by a corresponding peak above 0.55 kev . moreover , the hard photon intensity peaks at a different phase .    the eclipse light curve is clearly asymmetric , with the egress being faster than the ingress by a factor 23 ( see fig . [ unfoldlc ] ) . in order to investigate possible absorption effects we have divided the data into 19 phase bins and fitted the sum of a blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung model to the data , with the bremsstrahlung temperature again fixed at 20 kev and the blackbody temperature fixed at the best fit value of the phase - averaged spectrum ( 30 ev ) .",
    "thus , only the absorption and the two normalizations were free fit parameters . in order to have more than 1000 photons in each phase bin , the bin size covering the eclipse had to be chosen twice as large as the other bins .",
    "the result is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ foldlc ] and shows more or less the same absorbing column for all phase intervals except the eclipse interval .",
    "thus , we draw the following two conclusions : ( 1 ) the asymmetry in the eclipse light curve can not be explained by increased cold absorption during the ingress as compared to the egress .",
    "( 2 ) the mean non - zero flux observed during eclipse is more absorbed than the emission outside eclipse by a factor of 23 .",
    "this absorption alone could cause a drop of the x - ray count rate in the pspc by a factor of 610 during this phase interval !",
    "however , cold absorption of that amount should only reduce the pspc count rate below about channel 25 , whereas fig .",
    "[ foldlc3 ] reveals that the drop in intensity occurs at basically all energies . in order to effectively absorb photons up to channel 100",
    "would require a cold absorbing column ( of the stream ) of 10@xmath27 @xmath14 incompatible with the pulse height spectrum during this phase interval .",
    "thus , we conclude that the intensity drop around phase 0 ( 0.050.05 ) is not exclusively due to cold absorption but needs either partial covering or warm absorption .",
    "as noted above , 18 is optically identified with a v=15 mag cataclysmic variable .",

    "a significant period was found for both observing runs .",

    "these velocity differences suggest significant evolution in the accretion geometry between these two epochs .",
    "for example , there may have been changes in the proportion of the accretion rate travelling to the two magnetic poles .",
    "we have determined equivalent widths of some emission lines from these may 1993 spectra , e.g. 61.3   ( h@xmath29 ) , 51.3   ( h@xmath30 ) , 51.9   ( heii 4686  ) , and 13.2   ( hei 4471  ) . it is worth not only to mention the large equivalent widths but also the high ratio of he ii / h and he ii / he i.    the photometric observations revealed 0.3 mag variations , but there were no optical eclipses . folding the data with the above ephemeris gives the curves as shown in fig .",
    "[ phot ] . during october 1992 ,",
    "the low intensity part occurs around the phase of the x - ray eclipse while the maximum of the high intensity part is about 90  later .",
    "this suggests that the emission is dominated by cyclotron emission and the modulation is due to its beaming perpendicular to the magnetic field lines . during june 1992",
    "the optical light curve is distinctly different : the phasing seems to be shifted , the amplitude is much smaller ( about 0.1 mag ) and the shape is nearly symmetric .",
    "the maxima in the optical continuum also vary in amplitude from cycle to cycle , but they consistently appear near or just after the time at which the radial velocity crosses the midpoint from red - shifted to blue - shifted phases .    a check of 48 astrograph plates ( f series ; exposure time typically 3050 min . ) taken at sonneberg observatory between 19301932 and 19491968 showed the object to be either constant near the limiting magnitudes of the plates ( amplitude smaller than 0.2 mag ) or invisible on plates of poorer quality ( wenzel 1994 ) .",
    "the coincidence of periods derived from the x - ray and optical data and the stability of the eclipse feature over more than 5 years suggest that the binary system is synchronized .",
    "the evidence of an x - ray eclipse without a corresponding optical eclipse together with the shape and variations with time of the x - ray eclipse imply that ( 1 ) the optical and x - ray radiation originate from different emission regions and ( 2 ) the x - ray emitting region is confined to a small region near the white dwarf .",
    "the localized x - ray emitting region strongly indicates a magnetic cv subclass , since the x - ray emission from an inner accretion disk would only show eclipses when the disk is occulted by the companion star  and",
    "such eclipses are evident in both x - ray and optical light .",
    "the supersoft x - ray spectrum further suggests an am her / ` polar ' subtype ( rather than ` intermediate polar ' type ) , since the association between am her objects and luminous emission in soft x - rays is well established .",
    "we note , however , that the discovery of three intermediate polars with strong soft x - ray emission has changed this clear association ( haberl and motch 1995 ) .",
    "however , the consistency of singular optical and x - ray periods in the case of 18 indicates the likelihood of spin / orbital synchronous rotation , another classic property of am her binaries . finally , the large equivalent widths of the optical emission lines also suggest a polar nature .",
    "an independent confirmation of the polar classification comes from polarimetric observations ( szkody 1995 ) .",
    "the circular polarization in the 57007700   range reaches a maximum of 4% in two peaks separated by a minimum which occurs at the time of photometric minimum .",
    "the relatively short time scales observed for x - ray eclipse ingress , egress , and duration argue against the interpretation of eclipses as the disappearance of the x - ray emitting region behind the limb of the rotating white dwarf .",
    "we therefore interpret the eclipse as a self - eclipse of the x - ray emitting region by the accretion stream .",
    "x - ray spectral evidence for increased absorption column associated with the eclipse and the variable eclipse length provide further support for this conclusion .",
    "although one would expect the optical light curve to be more complex than the x - ray light curve due to several reasons ( cyclotron radiation is beam - modulated and can be self - eclipsing ; the recombination component is modulated by projection of the partially optically thick stream ; additional light may be seen from the illuminated side of the secondary ) , the observed optical light curve is surprisingly smooth . despite the stream - eclipse of the accretion spot in x - rays",
    ", the optical light is not affected due to its probable origin from a more extended region , including a portion of the accretion column upstream from the x - ray emitting area .",
    "the lack of optical eclipses suggests an inclination of @xmath31  ( assuming a typical m5/6 companion ) .    during mid eclipse ,",
    "there is still detectable emission not only in the total flux , but also in the soft x - ray component .",
    "thus , it seems possible that the accretion spot is not fully eclipsed or we see another , uneclipsed emission component .",
    "the presence of x - ray emission at all phases implies that @xmath32 90  ( with @xmath29 being the colatitude of the accreting magnetic pole ) .",
    "combining this with the condition of stream eclipse ( @xmath33 ) we derive the following constraints on @xmath34 and @xmath29 :    @xmath35    the x - ray light curve is very complex , and there are large differences seen when comparing observations well separated in time .",
    "this might suggest that the density and/or the size of the accretion stream vary with time and thus cause changes in the size and/or vertical extent of the accretion spot .",
    "in this regard , we note that the eclipse duration is not constant . also , there are large changes in the characteristics of a secondary minimum , as noted in section 2.1.2 and shown in fig .",
    "[ foldlc3 ] .",
    "furthermore , the eclipse length seems to be correlated with the intensity of the x - ray emission before and after the eclipse . during the oct .",
    "1992 observation ( cycle 4269 in fig .",
    "[ unfoldlc ] ) with its x - ray low - state , the eclipse length is only 0.07 phase units , whereas it is 0.1 during the high - state in sep .",
    "1993 and even 0.12 in the last eclipse observed . a higher x - ray intensity may be caused by an increase in the rate of mass transfer , perhaps leading to a larger width of the accretion stream , which then increases the duration of the x - ray eclipse .    a significant larger ingress ( 57 min . ) than egress ( 22.5 min .",
    ") is measured .",
    "such asymmetry is possible if the impact area is not a circle but an arc due to the coupling of the stream to nonpolar field lines ( see e.g. beuermann  1987 and their notion of `` x - ray auroral oval '' .",
    "alternatively , the accretion stream can be imagined to impact the white dwarf surface not from a perpendicular direction thus forming an elongated footprint on the white dwarf surface .",
    "the slow fall of x - ray intensity into the eclipse minimum then can be understood as being due to two effects : first , the projected area of the footprint decreases due to the rotation of the white dwarf and secondly , the stream starts to occult the footprint area .",
    "this is consistent with the observed x - ray spectral property that the absorbing column does not change during the start of the slow fall into eclipse minimum ( phase interval 0.00.1 , see fig .",
    "[ foldlc ] ) , but only during the eclipse ( phase interval 0.10.2 ) .",
    "such behaviour is also consistent with the interpretation of the variation of the polarization being due to varying aspects of an emission region extended in longitude ( szkody  1995 ) .",
    "a size estimate of this elongated emitting region beyond an axis ratio of about 23:1 is hard to evaluate since the relative sizes of the emitting region and the stream are important .",
    "the x - ray eclipse occurs about 35  after the blue - to - red crossing of the radial velocity curve . in our interpretation of a stream - eclipsing geometry",
    "this is consistent with the picture that the emission lines are produced in the ballistic part of the accretion stream .",
    "we note , however , that the radial velocity amplitude is lower than one would expect as the maximum free fall velocity .    the best fit blackbody temperature and the normalization transform into a corresponding blackbody radius of the emission region of 750 ( d/100 pc ) km .",
    "bearing in mind the above mentioned elongation this is understood as the radius of a circle which has the same area as the elongated emitting region .",
    "if true , this implies a stream diameter near the white dwarf surface of the order of 8501050 km .    besides the herewith presented 18  several other polars",
    "have been found where the accretion stream was identified as the cause of narrow absorption dips in the euv / x - ray light curves : ef eri ( patterson  1981 , beuermann  1991 ) , uz for ( warren , vallerga and sirk 1995 ) , ek uma ( clayton & osborne 1994 ) , qs tel ( beuermann & thomas 1993 , buckley  1993 , schwope  1995 ) , hu aqr ( schwope  1993 , hakala  1993 , schwope  1997 ) , qq vul ( beardmore  1995 ) and v2301 oph (= 1h1752 + 081 ) ( hessman  1997 )",
    ". another stream - eclipsing polar may be axj2315592 which has recently been found from asca observations ( misaki  1996 , thomas and reinsch 1996 ) .",
    "the euve light curves of uz for show that both the phase and the amplitude of the dips vary over the 3-day observation suggesting variations in the density and position of the accretion stream similar to what we observed in the  light curves of 18 . also , the x - ray light curve of qq vul as observed with rosat is surprisingly similar to that of 18  ( as given in fig .",
    "[ foldlc ] ) .      as in several other am her binaries , the soft x - ray luminosity of 18 is larger than the hard one , a fact known as ` soft x - ray problem ' ( rothschild  1981 ) .",
    "kujpers & pringle ( 1982 ) proposed that non - stationary accretion of dense blobs can heat the photosphere from below .",
    "this implies that high magnetic field systems should have a weak bremsstrahlung component , which is proved by a comparison of soft - to - hard flux ratios with measured magnetic field strengths in different am her systems ( beuermann & schwope 1994 ) . according to this correlation a magnetic field larger than 40 mg",
    "is suggested for 18  which has one of the highest ratios of soft / hard emission among polars .",
    "this would produce a very impressive zeeman split in the h absorption lines coming from the white dwarf as well as strong cyclotron humps ( depending on the viewing angle ) .",
    "however , since we observed the system `` only '' in its robust state of accretion , the optical spectrum is strongly dominated by the accretion stream making the determination of the magnetic field impossible .",
    "we have identified the  all - sky - survey x - ray source 18  as a v=15 mag .",
    "am her type object with a period of 6780.65@xmath50.01 sec ( 1.8835145@xmath50.000003 hr ) .",
    "while the optical light shows a smooth sinusoidal intensity variation , the x - ray light curve exhibits a double wave structure with a nearly complete eclipse and a broad dip about 0.35 phase units later .",
    "we interpret the eclipse as being due to the self - occultation of the emission region by the accretion stream .",
    "18  is one of the x - ray brightest stream - eclipsing am her variables and the study of this source allows a deep insight in the geometry of this binary system .",
    "further phase - resolved spectroscopy and polarimetry during a possibly upcoming optical low state should eventually reveal the magnetic field geometry .",

    "<S> we present x - ray and optical data of the newly discovered am her variable 18 . </S>",
    "<S> this x - ray source was observed in the  all - sky - survey in september 1990 and subsequently discovered as a highly variable and soft x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up pointed observations confirmed the strong variability and revealed a periodic flux modulation including a sharp and nearly complete eclipse of the x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> based on the shape and duration of this eclipse as well as the lack of optical eclipses we favour an interpretation in terms of a self - eclipse by the accretion stream . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum averaged over the full period is dominated by soft emission below 0.5 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of soft ( blackbody ) to hard ( bremsstrahlung ) bolometric energy flux is 1670 , distinguishing this object as another example of a polar with an extreme strong excess in soft x - rays . </S>"
