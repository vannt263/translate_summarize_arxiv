    "in many systems , the development of long range order is controlled by the dynamics of domain walls .",
    "the coarsening of domain structures evolving towards equilibrium has been studied extensively in pure systems @xcite but little is known quantitatively about domain growth in the presence of quenched disorder . in random systems , the nonequilibrium dynamics plays an even more important role than in pure systems and is most relevant for understanding experiments , since many random systems become glassy at low temperatures with ultraslow dynamics which prevent full thermal equilibrium from being established within the accessible time scales .",
    "this slow dynamics is due , at least in cases in which it is qualitatively understood , to the large free energy barriers that must be overcome for order to be established on long length scales .",
    "some of the best studied cases both experimentally and theoretically are a variety of random magnetic systems , particularly spin glasses and random field magnets @xcite .",
    "both of these systems have engendered a great deal of controversy about their equilibrium behavior and the resolution of these controversies has been greatly hampered by the inability of experiments to reach equilibrium .",
    "one might well argue , however , that the most interesting properties of such random systems are , in fact , not their equilibrium properties , but the non - equilibrium dynamics involved in their sisyphean struggle to reach equilibrium .",
    "because of the dominance of the behavior of so many random systems by the interplay between equilibrium and non - equilibrium dynamic effects , it is important to find models with quenched randomness for which solid results about dynamics can be obtained . in particular , one would like to be able to analyze the effects of activated dynamics caused by large barriers and compare results to predictions which come from either phenomenolgical scaling approaches to the dynamics  often known somewhat misleadingly as  droplet models \" @xcite , or from mean field approaches @xcite .",
    "many of the interesting phenomena go under the general name of _ aging _  the dependence of measurable properties such as correlations and responses on the history of the system , in particular on how long it has equilibrated for : its  age \" .",
    "for example , one would like to compute quantities which probe the violations of the fluctuation dissipation relations caused by non - equilibrium effects and compare them with results obtained in mean field models@xcite ; this has been done previously for coarsening of pure models @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest non - trivial random models , and one in which coarsening occurs , is the random field ising model ( rfim ) in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "although this system does not have true long - range order , for weak randomness it exhibits a wide range of scales over which dynamics is qualitatively like those of other random systems , especially those , like two dimensional random field magnets and two - dimensional spin glasses , which do not have phase transitions but exhibit much dynamic behavior qualitatively similar to their three - dimensional counterparts which do have phase transitions .",
    "in particular , the weakly random 1d rfim has a wide range of length scales over which the typical size of ordered domains grows logarithmically with time at low temperatures . in 1d ,",
    "the rfim is equivalent to a spin glass in an applied magnetic field ; this , or some analogous 1d systems should be conducive to experimental investigation .",
    "for a recent review on the rfim see e.g. @xcite .    the _ equilibrium _ properties of the 1d rfim and of the 1d spin glass in a field have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "several thermodynamic quantities such as the energy , entropy and magnetization have been computed exactly at low temperature for a binary distribution of the randomness in @xcite and for continuous distributions in @xcite .",
    "results are also available for distributions of bonds with anomalous weight near the origin @xcite .",
    "the free energy distribution has been studied in @xcite .",
    "equilibrium correlation functions are harder to obtain and only a few _ explicit _ exact results exist . for the binary distribution",
    "some results are presented in @xcite .",
    "certain special limits have been solved , such as the infinite field strength limit which is related to percolation @xcite , but for , e.g. , higher cumulants of averages of truncated correlations , only the general structure has been discussed @xcite .    in this paper we derive a host of exact results for the _ nonequilibrium dynamics _ of the rfim and for the 1d ising spin glass in a field , and , as a side benefit , also obtain many equilibrium results , some new .",
    "those of our results for equilibrium quantities that can be compared with previously known ones are found to agree with these .",
    "here we focus on the universal regime of the rfim in which both the random field and the temperature are much smaller than the exchange coupling , the length and time scales are sufficiently long and the random field dominates the dynamics . with the random field being weak and the temperature low ,",
    "the equilbrium correlation length is long and essentially the same as that at zero temperature  the imry - ma length .",
    "the coarsening of domains starting from initial conditions with only short distance correlations  such as a quench from high temperature  will , after a rapid initial transient , be dominated by the randomness over a wide range of time scales .",
    "the basic tool that we use in this paper is a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method which we have developed recently to obtain exact results for the non equilibrium dynamics of several 1d disordered systems @xcite .",
    "most of our previous results have been for the _ sinai model _ that describes the diffusion of a random walker in a 1d _ random static force field _ which is equivalent to a random potential that itself has the statistics of a 1d random walk @xcite .",
    "it can readily be seen that individual domain walls in the classical rfim diffuse in a random potential of exactly this sinai form , the complication being that they annihilate upon meeting . as shown in @xcite the rsrg",
    "can also be applied to many - domain - wall problems such as that which corresponds to the rfim .",
    "a few of the results of this paper have already been presented in a short paper @xcite ; the aim of the present paper is to show in detail how the rsrg method applies to such disordered spin models and to explore more of its consequences .",
    "although we will give here a detailed discussion of the rsrg for the spin model , we will rely on ref .",
    "@xcite for many results about the single particle diffusion aspects of the problem ; these we will only sketch , referring the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "as for the single particle problem , the rsrg method allows us to compute a great variety of physical quantities , remarkably , including even some which are not known for the corresponding pure model ( e.g. the domain persistence exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "this provides another impetus for the study of the random models . using the rsrg",
    "we also obtain the equilibrium behavior which corresponds to a well defined scale at which the decimation is stopped .",
    "the rsrg method is closely related to that used to study disordered quantum spin chains @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature of the rg is coarse - graining the energy landscape in a way that preserves the long time dynamics . despite its approximate character , the rsrg yields for many quantities asymptotically exact results . as in @xcite",
    "it works because the width of the distribution of barrier heights grows without bound on long length scales , consistent with rigorous results of @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that an exact rg has also been applied to the problem of coarsening of the _",
    "pure 1d _ soft - spin ising @xmath13 model at zero temperature for which persistence exponents have been computed @xcite .",
    "extensions to higher dimensions of the rsrg method for equilbrium quantum models have recently been obtained @xcite ; these introduce hope that other dynamical models could be studied in higher dimensions as well .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ secmodel ]",
    "we define the rfim and spin glass models and their dynamics and in section [ summary ] we summarize some of the main results and the physics involved . in section [ secrsrg ]",
    "we explain how the rsrg method is applied to the rfim , give the corresponding equations and fixed point solutions and discuss the properties of the asymptotic large time state . in section [ secsingle ] we derive exact large time results for single time quantities such as the energy , the magnetization and the domain size distribution . in section [ secsinglecorr ]",
    "we obtain the time dependent single time two spin correlation functions both with and without an applied field . in section [ secaging ]",
    "we compute the two time spin autocorrelation as well as the two - point two - time correlations . in section [ secrare ]",
    "we study aging phenomena which necessitate considering rare events which dominate all moments of the thermal ( truncated ) correlations , which we obtain , as well as the response to a small uniform magnetic field applied after a waiting time @xmath4 as in a typical aging experiment .",
    "we also compute the fluctuation dissipation ratio @xmath5 . in section [ secpersist ]",
    "we compute the persistence properties  the probabilities of no changes  of a single spin , of the local magnetization and of domains .",
    "finally in section [ secfinite ] we obtain the distribution of the total magnetization and of the number of domains for large finite size systems .",
    "a brief discussion of the possibilities for experimental tests of the predictions and speculation on the applicability of the some of the general features to higher dimensional systems are presented at the end of the paper .",
    "various technical results are relegated to appendices . in appendix",
    "[ cvfull ] the convergence towards the asymptotic state is shown . in appendix [ autobias ] the time dependent single - time two - spin correlation functions in an applied field is derived while in appendix [ appssss ] , the two - point two - time correlations are computed in detail and in appendix [ appfinite ] some of the finite size properties are analyzed .",
    "we consider the random field ising chain consisting of n spins @xmath14 with hamiltonian :    @xmath15    with independent random fields @xmath16 with identical distribution whose important moments are : @xmath17 so that @xmath18 can be considered as a uniform applied field and @xmath19 is the mean - square disorder strength ; here and henceforth we denote averages over the quenched randomness  usually equivalent to averages over different parts of the system  by overbars .",
    "the statics and the dynamics of the random field ising model ( rfim ) can be studied in terms of domain walls living on the dual lattice : on the bonds @xmath20 will be indexed by their left - hand site @xmath21 .",
    "a configuration of spins @xmath22 can be represented as a series of  particles \" @xmath23 corresponding to domain walls of type @xmath24 at positions @xmath25 , and  particles \" @xmath26 corresponding to domain walls of type @xmath27 at positions @xmath28 ; these must of course occur in an alternating sequence @xmath29 .",
    "[ the relation between the numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 of domain walls depends on the boundary conditions : for instance in a system with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath32 , while in a system with free boundary conditions , @xmath33 . ]",
    "it is very useful to introduce the _ potential _ felt by the domain walls :    @xmath34    and rewrite the energy of a configuration @xmath22 in terms of the positions of the set of domain walls as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the energy of the reference configuration where all spins are ( + ) : @xmath37 each domain wall costs energy @xmath38 ; the domain walls a feel the random potential @xmath39 ; whereas the b walls feel the potential @xmath40 , i.e. the two type of domain walls feel _ opposite _ random potentials .",
    "let us first recall some known features of the statics . in the absence of an applied field ( @xmath41 ) the system is disordered at @xmath42 and contains domains with typical size given by the imry ma length : @xmath43 obtained from the following simple argument : the creation of a single pair of domain walls ( @xmath23 , @xmath26 ) a distance @xmath44 apart costs exchange energy @xmath45 independent of @xmath44 .",
    "but the random potential has typical variations @xmath46 , and thus the typical energy that the system can gain on a length @xmath44 by using a favorable configuration of the random potential is of order @xmath47 .",
    "the two energies become comparable for @xmath48 and for @xmath49 , it becomes favourable for the system to create domain walls .",
    "thus the ground state will contain domains of typical size @xmath50 .",
    "one should note the difference between the case of e.g. bimodal distributions ( for which the ground state can be degenerate ) and continuous distributions for which it is non - degenerate ; we will generally consider continuous distributions for simplicity .    at positive temperature without a random field ,",
    "the thermal correlation length @xmath51 gives the typical size of domains in the system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath52 .",
    "but in the presence of the random field the equilibrium state at finite temperature is dominated by the random fields and still given by the imry ma picture provided : @xmath53 which is the regime studied in the present paper .    in presence of a uniform applied field",
    "@xmath54 the system at low temperature will contain domains of both orientations but with different typical sizes leading to a finite magnetization per spin @xmath55 .      in this paper we will study the magnetization non - conserving dynamics of the rfim model ( [ rfimmodel ] ) starting from a random initial condition at time @xmath56 corresponding to a quench from a high temperature state .",
    "although our results are independent of the details of the dynamics ( provided it satisfies detailed balance and is non - conserving ) let us for definiteness consider glauber dynamics where the transition rate from a configuration @xmath57 to the configuration @xmath58 obtained from @xmath57 by a flip of the spin @xmath59 , is : @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which satisfies the detailed balance condition and where @xmath61 is the energy difference between the two configurations , which takes the following possible values in terms of domain walls : @xmath62    in this paper we focus on the regime : @xmath63 in which ( [ regime ] ) holds .",
    "the randomness will dominate on length scales that are sufficiently large so that the cumulative effect of the random field energies is greater than @xmath52 ; i.e. for scales @xmath64 so that there will be only one basic length and time scale , it is simplest to consider @xmath65 .",
    "there will be a wide range of time scales during which the domains grow from initial sizes of @xmath66 to sizes of order @xmath50 by which time the system will be close to equilibrium . since the imry - ma length @xmath50 is very large , we expect universality of the long time dynamics , as we indeed find .      in this paper",
    "we also consider the 1d ising spin glass in a uniform field @xmath67 :    @xmath68    as is well known , in the case of a bimodal @xmath69 distribution with equal probabilities for either sign , 1d ising spin glasses in a field are equivalent via a gauge transformation to random field ferromagnets .",
    "more precisely , setting @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and defining @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 , the gauge transformation gives the new hamiltonian @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "since the @xmath77 are independent random variables taking the values @xmath78 with probability 1/2 , the fields @xmath79 are also independent random variables taking the values @xmath80 with probability 1/2 .",
    "hence the new hamiltonian describes a @xmath81 random field ising model with @xmath41 and @xmath82 in ( [ rfimmodel ] ) .",
    "the physical interpretation is as follows .",
    "the spin glass chain in zero field ( @xmath83 ) has two ground states , given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , which correspond , via the gauge tranformation , to the pure ising ground states @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the presence of a field @xmath88 ,",
    "the ground state of the spin glass is made out of domains of either zero field ground states .",
    "their typical size is thus given by the imry - ma length @xmath89 .",
    "these domains correspond to the intervals between frustrated bonds since at the position of a domain wall one has @xmath90 .",
    "similarly each domain has magnetization :    @xmath91    which is thus proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding barrier of the sinai random potential , a property which will be used below .    via the gauge transformation , the non equilibrium dynamics ( e.g. glauber dynamics ) of the spin glass in a field starting either from ( i ) random initial conditions ( corresponding to a quench from high temperature ) or from ( ii ) the pure ferromagnetic state ( obtained by applying a large magnetic field that is quickly reduced to be @xmath92 ) corresponds to the non equilibrium dynamics ( e.g. glauber ) of the rfim also starting from random initial conditions .",
    "thus in the regime @xmath93 many of the universal results obtained for the rfim will hold directly for the spin glass in a field .",
    "thus we will study the two models in parallel in the present paper .",
    "an important complication in applying the results to 1d spin glasses is that the strengths of the exchange couplings will in general be random .",
    "this provides an extra random potential for the domain walls which has , however , only short range correlations .",
    "the conditions for there to be a wide regime of validity of the universal coarsening behavior found here is that the distribution of exchanges be _ narrow _ : @xmath94 ideally , with @xmath95 or smaller .",
    "note that the equilbrium correlation length will be set by @xmath96 for small @xmath67 as the domain walls can easily find positions with @xmath97 that are near to extrema of the potential caused by the random fields .",
    "having defined the models , before turning to the details of the calculations , we now briefly decribe the important physics and summarize our main results .",
    "as for any ising system , the static and dynamic properties of random spin chains can be fully described in terms of domain walls between  up \" and  down \" domains .",
    "the crucial simplification in 1d is that the domain walls , which come in two types @xmath98 and @xmath99 , are point objects . as discussed above",
    ", a random field induces a potential that the walls feel which has the statistics of a random walk so that its variations on a length scale @xmath44 are of order @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath23 walls tend to minima of the potential while the @xmath26 walls tend to maxima .",
    "if they meet they annihilate but , on the time scales of interest here , the probability that a pair is spontaneously created , @xmath101 can be ignored .",
    "as shown by sinai @xcite , the motion of a single domain wall in such a random potential is completely dominated by the barriers that have to be surmounted to find low energy extrema .",
    "since the time to surmount a barrier of height @xmath102 is of order @xmath103 , and to find a minima a distance @xmath44 away a barrier of order @xmath104 will have to be overcome , the typical distance a wall moves in time @xmath105 is only of order @xmath106 .",
    "although this motion is controlled by rare thermal fluctuations that take the wall over a large barrier , the position of a wall that started at a known point can , at long times , be predicted with surprising accuracy .",
    "this is because the width of the distribution of barriers to go distances of order @xmath44 is as broad as the magnitude of the lowest barrier which enabled the wall to move that distance .",
    "thus at long times , when the barriers become very high , the probability of going first over other than the lowest surmountable barrier that delimits the region in which the wall is currently , is extremely small .",
    "the position of a single wall at long times is thus determined by its initial position and by the height of the maximum barrier which it _ could _ surmount up to that time ; this quantity , which we denote @xmath107 yields a well defined region that the wall can explore up to time @xmath105 .",
    "the boundaries of the appropriate region that encompasses the wall s initial position are determined by @xmath108 .",
    "the wall will be in local equilbrium in this  valley \" on time scales of order @xmath105 and thus tend to spend most of its time near the bottom of the valley .",
    "this behavior , as proved by golosov @xcite , implies that the long time dynamics of a single wall is pseudodeterministic : rescaled by the typical distance it has gone , @xmath109 , the wall s position is _ asymptotically deterministic _ at long times .    in a random field ising chain , the two types of domain walls move in random potentials which are identical except for their sign .",
    "when walls meet , they annihilate . not surprisingly , since each wall can move a distance of order @xmath109 in time @xmath105 and they can not pass through each other or occupy the same position , the density of domain walls remaining at time @xmath105 is simply of order @xmath110 so that the correlation length starting from random ( or short - range correlated ) initial conditions grows as @xmath111 this is in sharp contrast to the much faster power - law growth of the correlation length in most non - random systems , for example , the @xmath112 for ising systems with non - conserved order parameter",
    ".    the time - dependent correlation length can be more precisely defined from the average non - equilibrium correlation function .",
    "this , and most other non - equilibrium properties , are scaling functions of the ratio of lengths to powers of log - times , as is characteristic of  activated dynamic scaling \" @xcite which occurs in many random systems .",
    "we find that in zero applied field the average equal - time correlation function behaves as @xmath113 whose fourier transform is at large time : @xmath114\\ ] ] with @xmath115 denoting the real part .",
    "these results obtain until the non - equilibrium correlation length @xmath116 reaches the equilibrium correlation length @xmath117 it is intriguing that the _ form _ of the non - equilibrium correlations in the universal scaling limit are _ identical _ to those of the equilibrium correlations , the only difference being the correlation length .",
    "a remarkable property of the coarsening in the rfim chain was conjectured in @xcite : the positions of the _ set _ of domain walls and hence all of the correlations in the non - equilibrium state are _ asymptotically deterministic _ at long times .",
    "this means that while the evolution of the domain wall structure is only logarithmic in time , the domain wall configurations of two runs following quenches using the same sample converge to each other much more rapidly : as a power of time !",
    "more precisely , the probability that the spin configurations of the two runs measured at the same time after the quench differ substantially in a region of size of order @xmath118 decays to zero as a non - universal power of time , becoming negligible well before the system is anywhere near equilibrium .",
    "[ strictly speaking , because in rare region , as discussed later , fluctuations of the position of an individual or neighboring pair of domain walls will exist , one will need to do a certain amount of time averaging for this pseudodeterminism to become most evident ]    the asymptotic determinism will occur even if the initial conditions were macroscopically distinct in the two runs : for example , if one was quenched from a high temperature state in zero applied field , and the other from a high temperature state with a small net magnetization caused by a uniform applied field .",
    "this pseudodeterminism in a system with many degrees of freedom is a dramatic effect ; it implies that history dependence can , even under strongly non - equilibrium conditions , be weak ; one might thereby be fooled into thinking that such history independence implies equilibrium .    while the equal - time correlations during coarsening converge to an equilibrium - like form , two - time quantities show interesting history dependence , generally depending on _ both _",
    "times rather than just the time difference as they would do in equilibrium .",
    "there are typically three regimes : the later time , @xmath105 , much longer than the earlier , @xmath119 , the two times of the same order , and the _ difference _ between the two times , @xmath120 much smaller than either time .",
    "the scaling variables in these three regimes are , respectively , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . in the first and third of these , the condition for asymptopia , that the scaling variable is small , is very difficult to attain in practice , thus knowing the full form of the scaling functions is essential for analyzing experimental or numerical data .",
    "note that only in the last of these regimes should one expect to find equilibrium - like behavior characteristic of the local equilibrium that is being probed .    in this paper",
    "we compute a variety of correlations and response functions that illustrate some of the interesting non - equilibrium behavior .",
    "the simplest of these is the temporal autocorrelations of a single spin . with no applied field , the average autocorrelation function",
    "is found to decay as a power of the ratio of the correlation lengths at the two times : @xmath124 for @xmath125 with the exponent @xmath126 . in a three dimensional spin glass ,",
    "the autocorrelation function determines the non - equilibrium decay of the magnetization after a large uniform field is turned off below the transition temperature@xcite .",
    "there are complications here due to the fact that a small applied field needs to be left on to provide the randomness , but the basic physics is similar .    the single spin autocorrelation function provides some information on how much memory the system has of its earlier history .",
    "more information is provided by the two - spin two - time correlation function @xmath127 which converges to a scaling function of @xmath128 and @xmath129 whose fourier transform in @xmath130 , @xmath131 , we compute exactly , to our knowledge the first such computation for a physical model pure or random . for an ideal spin glass",
    "in which there are no correlations between the positions of positive and negative exchanges and the distribution of the exchange strengths is symmetric in @xmath132 , this correlation function , @xmath133 , is the average over the randomness  or equivalently a positional average over the regions being probed by the scattering  of the product of the magnetic scattering intensity at time @xmath105 and wavevector @xmath134 and that at time @xmath119 and wavevector @xmath135 .",
    "other properties associated with  aging \" can also be computed exactly ; we study the thermal fluctuations around the configurations at two different times and the dynamic linear response to a uniform magnetic field that is turned on after waiting for some time for the system to equilibrate . in equilibrium , these are related by the fluctuation dissipation theorem but we find , as expected , that this relation generally fails except in the limit that the time difference is much less than the waiting time .",
    "the behavior we find is , however , rather different from that found in mean - field models @xcite and we discuss the contrasts between these results .    in random systems controlled by zero temperature fixed points , such as is the case in the regime of scales studied here , thermal fluctuations and linear response functions are both dominated by rare spatially isolated regions of the system  although which regions dominate depends on the time scales and properties of interest .",
    "the study of these thus involves the _ corrections _ to the deterministic approximation to the dynamics that led , as discussed above , to exact asymptotic results for many other quantities .",
    "the dominant events are rare by a factor of , typically , @xmath136 , but nevertheless still lead to universal results .    ",
    "persistence \" properties provide another probe of how much memory a system retains of its initial configuration , for example , what the probability is that a spin has never flipped . surprisingly , this and other related quantities  including some which are not known in pure systems  can also be computed exactly for the rfim chains .",
    "the coarsening process taking place in non equilibrium dynamics of the rfim starting from random initial conditions can be thought of as a reaction - diffusion process in a 1d random environment ( sinai landscape ) for the domain walls .",
    "indeed , in the regime @xmath137 considered in this paper , the creation of pairs of domain walls is highly suppressed .",
    "the dynamics of the domain walls is thus dominated by the random field as follows .",
    "the domains walls a quickly fall to the local minima of the random potential @xmath138 , whereas the b walls quickly move to the local maxima of @xmath139 .",
    "then they slowly diffuse by going over barriers in _ opposite _ sinai potentials @xmath140 . when an a and a b meet , they annihilate preserving the alternating abab ... sequence",
    ".    we can thus use the real - space renormalisation procedure introduced in @xcite to study the sinai diffusion of a single particle , and extend it to take into account the annihilation processes . in the single particle case this procedure was shown to be asymptotically exact at long length and time scales . here",
    "it is also expected to be asymptotically exact at large time , since as in the sinai case , we find that the the effective distribution of the random barrier heights become infinitely broad in the limit of large scales .",
    "thus the motion over the barriers becomes more and more deterministic at long times .",
    "we briefly outline the renormalization procedure , detailed in @xcite , for the diffusion of a particle in the sinai landscape @xmath139 .",
    "grouping segments with the same sign of the random field , one can start with no loss of generality from a `` zigzag '' potential @xmath139 where each segment (  bond \" ) is characterized by an energy barrier @xmath141 and a length @xmath142 . from the independence of the random fields on each site , the pairs of bond variables @xmath143 are independent from bond to bond and",
    "are chosen from a distribution @xmath144 normalized to unity .    the rg procedure which captures the long time behaviour in a given energy landscape ,",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "it consists of the iterative decimation of the bond with the _ smallest barrier _ and hence the shortest time scale for domain walls to overcome it @xcite @xcite .",
    "this smallest barrier , say , @xmath145 , together with its neighbors , the two bonds @xmath146 , are replaced by a single renormalized bond with barrier @xmath147 and length @xmath148 this defines a renormalized landscape at scale @xmath149 where all barriers smaller than @xmath149 have been eliminated .",
    "since the distribution of barriers is found to become broader and broader @xcite an arrhenius argument implies that the diffusion of a particle becomes better and better approximated at large time by the following `` effective dynamics '' @xcite .",
    "the position @xmath150 of a particle that started at @xmath151 at @xmath56 coincides with  or is at least very close to  the bottom of the renormalized bond at scale @xmath152 which contains @xmath151 .",
    "note that we choose time units so as to set the microscopic ( non - universal ) inverse attempt frequency to unity @xcite .",
    "this rg procedure is thus essentially decimation in _",
    "time_. processes that are faster than a given time scale are decimated away and assumed to be in local equilibrium .    in the presence of domain walls of type a and b",
    ", we must keep track of both the diffusion and the possible reactions of the domain walls that occur during the decimation . upon the decimation of bond 2",
    "( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , there are four possible cases , illustrated on figure [ fig2 ] , according to whether or not there is an a at the bottom of bond ( 2 ) and whether or not there is a b at the top of bond ( 2 ) . if ( i ) there are no a , no b , then one simply renormalise the bond and nothing happens to the domain walls . if ( ii ) there is an a but no b then a goes to the bottom of the new renormalized bond .",
    "if ( iii ) there is a b and no a then b goes to the top of the new renormalized bond . and",
    "if ( iv ) there is both an a and a b then the two domain walls meet and annihilate upon decimation .",
    "this annihilation will occur at a time of order @xmath153 determined by the barrier of the decimated bond : by assumption , @xmath149 at this scale .",
    "the only truly new process compared to the single particle diffusion is the case ( iv ) .",
    "the above rg rule is consistent with the large time dynamics in this case for the following reason . since a and b domains diffuse with independent thermal noises , the time it takes for them to meet is again @xmath154 ( accurate on a log scale ) . indeed",
    "the probability that they meet at a point at potential @xmath155 is @xmath156 ( as can be seen from considering the equivalent @xmath157 diffusion problem ( of the pair of wall positions ) with an absorbing wall at @xmath158 ) .",
    "the second difference from the procedure in the case of the single particle , is that it must be stopped when the renormalisation scale @xmath149 reaches the energy cost of creation of a pair of domain walls : @xmath159 indeed beyond this scale @xmath160 one must take into account creation of pairs of domain walls . as will be shown below , the state _ at",
    "_ @xmath161 gives the final equilibrium state .",
    "independently of whether the bonds contain domain walls ( a or b ) or not , which is studied in the next section , one can study the evolution under rg of the landscape .",
    "since the rg rules preserve the statistical independence of the variables @xmath143 from bonds to bonds , it is possible to write closed rg equations for the landscape , i.e. for @xmath162 and @xmath163 which denote the probabilities that a @xmath164 renormalized bond at scale @xmath149 has a barrier @xmath165 and a length @xmath166 , each normalized by @xmath167 .    @xmath168    where @xmath169 denotes a convolution with respect to @xmath166 only and @xmath170 with respect to both @xmath171 and @xmath166 with the variables to be convoluted denoted by dots .",

    "even armed with the statistical properties of the renormalized landscape , we still have to determine the long time distribution of the occupation of the extrema of this landscape by @xmath23 and @xmath26 domain walls . at first sight",
    "this seems a difficult problem .",
    "indeed the positions of a s and b s can be correlated over many bonds of the renormalized landscape since there are a priori empty maxima and minima and the domain wall positions must respect the alternating constraint ababab .",
    "however , the rg analysis becomes simple if the system reaches at some stage a `` full '' state which has one a wall at each minimum and one b wall at each maximum of the renormalized landscape as illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] .. it is easy to see that such a `` full '' state is preserved by the rg procedure .",
    "also note that this `` full '' state would obtain from the beginning if , for instance , the initial condition were completly antiferromagnetic .",
    "generally , we consider random initial conditions and thus the initial state is not a `` full '' state .",
    "however , one can show that the system converges _ exponentially _ in @xmath149 towards a `` full '' state , as we now discuss .",
    "the renormalisation procedure for the coarsening process of the rfim has the following important property : the configuration for the spins at scale @xmath149 depends only on the _ renormalized _ landscape at @xmath149 and on the _ initial _ configuration of the spins ( e. g. equilibrium at high temperature before the quench at @xmath56 ) . in particular it does not depend on the initial landscape or  except occasionally at early times before the barrier distribution becomes very broad  on the whole history of the reaction - diffusion processes of domain walls .",
    "let us first consider one ascending bond with extremities @xmath181 of the renormalized landscape and assume that there were initially @xmath182 domain walls in the interval @xmath181 .",
    "neglecting for the time being the influence of the two neighboring bonds , it is easy to see that the state at @xmath149 is determined only by @xmath182 and does not depend on the order in which the reactions between domain walls have occured : indeed , it is determined by the _",
    "parity _ of @xmath182 and by the nature of the domain wall closest to the bottom end .",
    "there are several cases    \\i ) if @xmath183 , then the final state of the occupation of the endpoints of the bond is @xmath184 .",
    "\\ii ) if @xmath182 is odd , and if the domain wall closest to the bottom is of type a , then the final state is @xmath185    \\iii ) if @xmath182 is odd , and if the domain wall closest to the bottom is of type b , then the final state is @xmath186    \\iv ) if @xmath182 is even with @xmath187 and the domain wall closest to the bottom is of type a , then the final state is @xmath188    \\v ) if @xmath182 is even with @xmath187 and the domain wall closest to the bottom wall is of type b , then the final state is @xmath184 .",
    "of course , to obtain the real occupation of the top and the bottom ends of one renormalized bond , one needs to consider what happens also on the two neighboring renormalized bonds and to compute the probabilities of the various states , taking properly care of the alternating constraint abab .",
    "this is done in appendix [ cvfull ] .",
    "it is found that the crucial feature is that in order for a bond not to have both ends occupied by domain walls , either it or one of its neighboring bonds must have had _ no _ domain walls on it initially .",
    "since the bonds tend to become progressively longer with time , the chance of this occuring drops rapidly with increasing @xmath149 .",
    "this will be true even if the positions of the domain walls have some local correlations , in particular for the case of an initial state that corresponds to a high temperature configuration in a small magnetic field so that there is an initial magnetization and the typical distances between a neighboring @xmath23 and @xmath26 wall will depend on which of the two is on the left .",
    "we thus find that the system converges towards the `` full '' state of the renormalized landscape exponentially fast in @xmath149 , with a non - universal coefficient that depends on the initial concentration of domain walls , on the inital magnetization , and on the strength of the randomness .",
    "this corresponds to a _ power law _",
    "decay in time , as @xmath189 with @xmath190 non - universal , of the probability that a maximum or minimum of the renormalized landscape at time @xmath105 is unoccupied .",
    "the positions of the full set of domain walls at long times are thus asymptotically deterministic and independent of the initial conditions provided these have only short range correlations .",
    "concretely , this asymptotic determinism can be characterized by the typical mean distance between  missing \" domain walls , i.e. , deviations from the deterministic full state .",
    "the distance between these  errors \" will grow exponentially in @xmath149 and hence as a power of time .",
    "the only exceptions to this are associated with fluctuations in the ( nominally ) _ full _ states : because of the rare times or configurations in which domain walls are either about to annihilate or are spending substantial fractions of their time in more than one valley ; these fluctuation induced  errors \" we will study in detail later ; they decay far more slowly with time than any persistent initial condition induced differences between runs .    since all the universal quantities that we will study have length scales that grow much more slowly  typically logarithmically  in time , or probabilites of occuring which decay much more slowly with time  typically as powers of @xmath191",
    " we restrict consideration in what follows to the analysis of full states . note that our results for the biased case in which there is a small uniform field applied in addition to the random field do yield power law growth of the correlation length with time , but in the regime of validity of these results , the power law is very small and again the effects of  missing \" domain walls are negligible at long times .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the rg procedure must be stopped at @xmath192 since at this scale one must start to take into account the energetic benfits of creation of pairs of domain walls . at scale @xmath161",
    "the typical domain size is the imry - ma length @xmath193 , and the energy can not be lowered further by _ any _ process in the full state . indeed , moving the domains walls without changing their number can not lower the total energy since domain walls already occupy all tops and bottoms of the renormalized potential .",
    "decreasing the number of domain walls by two can also not lower the energy since the gain is @xmath194 while the loss due to the random field for walls separated by a bond of barrier @xmath195 is @xmath196 .",
    "similarly , adding two walls the cost is @xmath194 and the gain is @xmath197 since the only positions they can occupy are by definition separated by a barrier @xmath198 which has already been decimated . thus if the renormalization is stopped at @xmath199 , in the small field , low @xmath52 scaling limit the configuration of the walls corresponds precisely to the ground state and , up to negligible thermal fluctuations , to the thermal _",
    "equilibrium state_. thus we are able to compute equilibrium properties straightforwardly from the renormalization group analysis .",
    "thus the rg allows one to study the approach to equilibrium starting from any initial condition characterized by typical domain sizes @xmath200 , where @xmath201 represents the temperature before the quench .",
    "as explained above , under these conditions the relaxation towards equilibrium always takes place by diffusion and annihilation of domain walls before any domain creation can occur .",
    "a qualitatively different type of evolution towards equilibrium takes place in the other limit ( not studied here ) : @xmath202 still imposing @xmath203 .",
    "this is a regime of initial temperatures low enough that the initial density of domains is very small . in that case",
    "a very different relaxation process towards the _ same equilibrium state _ discussed above takes place : for @xmath204 well separated domain walls diffuse independently with very rare annihilations .",
    "when @xmath149 reaches @xmath199 many domain walls are  suddenly \"  within a factor of two or so in time  created and the large initial domains break into many smaller ones of size @xmath50",
    "thus , the relaxation is more abrupt in this case than in the more interesting one studied in the present paper .",
    "from the knowledge of the fixed point for renormalized landscape ( [ solu - biased ] ) and the fact that the system reaches the full state ( exponentially fast in @xmath149 ) where each top is occupied by a b domain and each bottom by a a domain , we can immediately compute several simple quantities .",
    "we will compare these results with the existing exact results known in the statics .",
    "specializing ( [ solu - biased ] ) to the case @xmath174 in the absence of an applied field the fixed - point of the rg equation is @xcite @xmath205 where we have introduced the dimensionless rescaled variables for barriers @xmath206 and for bond lengths @xmath207      thus for large @xmath208 , the average bond length @xmath209 , equal to the average distance between two domain walls , behaves as @xmath210 the number of domain walls per unit length decays as @xmath211 up to time @xmath212 at which equilibrium is reached and : @xmath213      the energy per spin as a function of time ( i.e of @xmath208 ) is simply given by    @xmath214    where @xmath215 denotes the averaged barrier at scale @xmath149 .",

    "if the distribution is continuous we expect @xmath220 from short scales , also non universal .",

    "we address two issues : the potential observability of some of the one - dimensional physics that we have studied in detail ; and the crucial issue of which features of these one - dimensional systems might apply in higher dimensional random systems .",
    "although random field ising ferromagnets are not directly realizable experimentally , other systems in the same universality class should be . for random antiferromagnets , an applied magnetic field couples to the antiferromagnetic order parameter as a random field ,",
    "most simply if the local magnetic moments vary randomly ; such systems have the obvious advantage of the strength of the dominant randomness being readily adjustable .",
    "similarly , spin glasses , although unfrustrated in zero - field , do exist in quasi - one - dimensional systems . in both of these types of systems , rapid quenches could be performed by decreasing the field at low temperatures down to a value of order @xmath712 at which coarsening can take place . in practice , other types of randomness in , for example , antiferromagnetic or frustrated two - leg spin - ladder systems in an applied field may have advantages .",
    "there is one physical phenomenon of which one must be wary : in many random systems  especially spin - glasses @xcite  the equilibrium states toward which the system strives depend hypersensitively on macroscopic parameters such as the temperature and the magnetic field ; this is often referred to  somewhat confusingly  as  chaos \" @xcite .",
    "if this were the case here , then changing the temperature or the magnetic field would not correspond simply to speeding up the dynamics , but would instead drive the system towards a new equilibrium which might differ on the scales being probed from the original one .",
    "indeed , this effect is the origin of much of the most interesting aging phenomena seen in three - dimensional spin glasses @xcite .",
    "fortunately  although less interestingly  this effect does not occur in random field chains : although the effective local random fields could change in a non - uniform way with temperature or with applied field , this will lead only to smooth modifications of the large scale potential and thus , provided the changes are made sufficiently slowly , will not change the universal aspects of the coarsening provided all lengths are scaled appropriately .",
    "the most obvious difficulty for any experiment is one that is ubiquitous in random systems : how does one obtain a reasonable range of length scales if the correlations are growing only logarithmically in time ?",
    "the situation here is not quite as bad as it might seem as on macroscopic time scales @xmath713 is not all that short : with a microscopic time , @xmath714 , of order picoseconds , a minute corresponds to coarsening by a factor of a thousand in length scale .",
    "but for one - dimensional random - field systems , one can do much better : the correlation length is of order @xmath715 with @xmath716 a microscopic scale .",
    "thus the correlation length can be controlled by a combination of increasing time , increasing @xmath52 and decreasing @xmath67 . to get a wide range of @xmath118 ,",
    "it is beneficial to start with @xmath67 large enough that the shortest time scales which can be measured still correspond to microscopic lengths and then decrease the field gradually .",
    "while some of the non - equilibrium properties studied here should be amenable to conventional experimental probes in magnetic systems , some of the most interesting predictions will probably not be : how the specific set of domain walls depends on equilibration time and how it varies  or does not vary  from run - to - run on the same sample .",
    "for these one needs either microscopic imaging probes  perhaps with magnetic atomic force or tunnelling microscopy  or scattering data with enough resolution that speckle patterns from a finite spot size can be measured .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the spatial fourier transform of the two - point two - time correlation calculated here is , for spin glasses , related to the correlations between the speckle patterns at the two different times . while measuring this with magnetic x - ray or neutron scattering may not be possible , it should be feasible via light scattering on systems in the same universality class in which the length scales are sufficiently long .",
    "one system on which light scattering measurements might be possible is a nematic liquid crystal in a long thin tubes with a square crossection and heterogeneities on the surfaces which would couple randomly to the two possible symmetry related orientations of the nematic director .",
    "whether this or other systems can be formed in a regime in which the dynamics are sufficiently fast to allow a wide range of length scales to equilibrate is a question whose answer must rely on a quantitative analysis of the physics on the scale of the domain wall structures that should occur .",
    "many of the qualitative features of the coarsening process in rfim chains are also expected to obtain in higher dimensional random systems .",
    "these are particularly interesting in systems in which , in contrast to the one - dimensional models , true long - range order should exist in equilibrium . nevertheless , the characteristics of the coarsening process in the one - dimensional models with weak randomness should have much in common with such systems as long as consideration is restricted , as we have primarily done , to time - scales such that the full equilibrium correlation length can not be attained .",
    "features that are common to many higher dimensional random systems  random exchange ferrommagnets , random field magnets and , although more controversially , spin glasses  include : growth of some kind of domain structure by thermal activation over barriers that grow with length scale and are broadly distributed ; and the existence of aging and other history dependent phenomena . from a renormalization group point of view , these features are general characteristics of systems controlled by random zero - temperature fixed points @xcite",
    ". the notions of local equilibrium within constraints caused by large barriers and of domination of the dynamics at any given long time scale by rare regions of the sample in which the rate for going over barriers is of order the frequency being probed , are both important . in general , this will , as in the one - dimensional models , result in three different regimes for two - time properties depending on whether the difference between the times is much smaller , of order of , or much larger than , the earlier time .",
    "one of the most intriguing questions concerns the pseudo - determinism found in the one - dimensional random models .",
    "will this exist in some higher dimensional systems in which the domain walls are lines or surfaces whose evolution in time will involve topological changes , rather than points which can simply move or annihilate ?",
    "i.e. , will domain walls tend to lie , at long times , in similar sample - and - time - specific positions which are only weakly dependent on the initial conditions ? or will they evolve in different runs in very distinct ways perhaps by retaining much more memory of the initial conditions ?",
    "two examples of a _ single _ random walker diffusing in random potentials illustrate some of the difficulties of drawing any definitive conclusions .",
    "consider , first , a random potential which is independently random at each site with a long power law tail ot the distribution of the depth of the potential wells",
    ". the deep wells will give rise to subdiffusive behavior , indeed , simple considerations of the time to find a deep trap and the time to escape it imply that the typical distance the walker will diffuse in time @xmath105 only grows as a power of @xmath572 .",
    "but the statistics of the _ set of sites _ the walker visits by the time it has made a given number of jumps from one site to another will be identical to that of a normal free random walker ; it is just the _ time spent _ on each site that causes the slow diffusion . since a pair of random walkers in dimensions higher than four have a non - zero probability of never visiting any sites in common , it is clear that the long time behavior is _",
    "not _ deterministic in high dimensions : two different runs starting from the same point will have a probablity that vanishes at long times of the two walkers being at the same site . in two dimensions , in contrast , the pair of walkers will be very likely to be trapped at the same site at long times .",
    "[ the three dimensional case is more subtle but will be more like the high dimensional that the low dimensional case . ]    a second type of random potential yields different behavior : a gaussian random potential with mean zero and @xmath717 ^ 2 } \\sim |{\\bf x - y}|^{2\\zeta}$ ] with @xmath718 .",
    "a pair of random walkers in such a potential will tend to get trapped in the _ same _ deep valley at long times .",
    "this can be argued by considering the borders of valleys which are surrounded by barriers of at least a height @xmath149 .",
    "if these typically do not have a lot of fine - scale structure , then they should act as effective traps for all walkers in the vicinity .",
    "all the walkers will then tend to eventualy leave such a valley over the same barrier and hence end up in the same next - larger - scale valley as well .",
    "the behavior would then be asymptotically deterministic as in the one - dimensional sinai model .",
    "the crucial feature that distinguishes these two cases , seems to be the smoothness of the potential : in the first example , the deep potential wells come from very short wavelength fluctuations and there is thus no useful notion of a coarse - grained potential .",
    "but in the second example , the deep potential wells come , as in one - dimension , from long - wavelength slowly varying components ; thus coarse - graining the potential to yield approximate dynamics which are asymptotically exact should be possible",
    ". we should emphasize , however , that it is by no means established even for this simple model of a random walk in a smoothly varying gaussian random potential that the conclusion argued above  that the dynamics will be asymptotically deterministic  will be valid in high dimensions .",
    "we consider , for simplicity , random initial configurations of the spins , in which there is an independent probability @xmath719 that each intersite position is occupied by a domain wall , and a probability @xmath720 that it is not .",
    "such random initial configurations describe , for example , initial equilibrium before a quench from a temperature @xmath201 which is high enough that the random fiels are negligible and the system behaves like a pure chain .",

    "@xmath739 on a ascending bond ) , then all four possible neighborhoods of this bond can occur .",
