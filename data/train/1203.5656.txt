    "devices were prepared by standard mechanical exfoliation of bulk mos@xmath0 on 300 nm sio@xmath8 on @xmath9 doped silicon substrate using scotch tape technique .",

    "we present detailed experiments on five devices ( see table i ) of different film thicknesses . in fig .",
    "1c we show raman spectra for bulk , tri and single layer mos@xmath0 films .",
    "we focus on the e@xmath11 and a@xmath12 modes which have been shown to be sensitive to the number of atomic layers .",
    "@xcite the position of both modes agree well with recent investigation of raman spectroscopy in thin exfoliated mos@xmath0 films .",
    "the separation of e@xmath11 and a@xmath12 peaks were found to be 23  @xmath13 , 21  @xmath13 and 16 -18  @xmath13 for tri , bi and single layer respectively . for further confirmation of raman data",
    ", we determined the thickness of flakes using contact mode afm . a line scan across the edge of a single layer flake ( fig .",
    "1d ) shows a step of @xmath14  nm which compares very well with the thickness of the single mos@xmath0 layer ( @xmath15  nm ) .",
    "the electrical contacts , designed with electron beam lithography , consisted of thermally evaporated ti / au or au films . the optical image of the mos3l device is shown in fig .",
    "all measurements were carried out in cryostats under high vacuum ( @xmath16  mbar ) condition . in all devices the gate voltage ( @xmath17 )",
    "was applied only at the doped silicon backgate ( see fig .",
    "measurements were primarily two - probe current measurement using lockin technique due to very high resistance of these systems , although four - probe devices were fabricated as well .",
    "we found , at high doping concentration , the contact resistance was negligible near room temperature , but increases to about half of sample resistance below 100k .",
    "detailed @xmath18 measurements , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the drain - source current and bias respectively , were conducted to characterize the electrical contacts ( see supplementary information ) . at low voltages ( @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23  mv ) , @xmath18 at all @xmath17 and near room temperature , were linear for both ti / au and au deposited samples although we have got better linear contact with only au .",
    "these results bear close resemblance to the characteristics reported recently for high mobility mos@xmath0 devices .",
    "@xcite as shown in the supplementary information , @xmath18 characteristics become nonlinear at large @xmath20 , particularly at low temperatures ( @xmath24 ) , although we attribute this to the insulating nature of the devices which causes the nonlinearity . the symmetric nature of @xmath19-@xmath20 around @xmath25",
    "enables us to eliminate any possibility of schottky contact in our operating @xmath20 range .",
    "this is supported by the observed magnitude of the differential carrier mobility @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the gate capacitance per unit area ( here @xmath28 f / m@xmath29 for 300 nm sio@xmath0 ) , and @xmath30 is the linear conductivity at low @xmath20 . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the length and width of the mos@xmath0 channel . in both two and four - probe geometry ,",
    "we obtained similar values of mobility , which are typical values reported for mos@xmath0 transistors  @xcite on sio@xmath0 substrate ( see table i ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the variation of @xmath33 in mos3l and mos1la as a function of @xmath17 over a range @xmath34  k to 280  k. the conduction was achieved predominantly in the positive @xmath17 regime implying that the mos@xmath0 films were intrinsically @xmath35-type .",
    "@xcite the doping was higher in mos3l which required a negative @xmath17 to pinch - off completely .",
    "below @xmath36  k both devices were strongly insulating at all @xmath37 .",
    "a weak metal - like behavior was observed at @xmath38  k and very high doping ( large positive @xmath17 ) for most of the samples . such a behavior , which was stronger in mos3l , was found to be connected to a decrease in @xmath39 with increasing @xmath24 in this regime ( inset of figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) .",
    "this can be attributed to enhanced scattering of electrons by phonons at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite at low @xmath24 , both @xmath33 and @xmath39 drop rapidly with decreasing @xmath24 .",
    "such an insulating behavior was observed in multilayer nanopatches of mos@xmath0 ( thickness : 8 @xmath40 35  nm ) as well ,  @xcite with an apparent activated behavior of @xmath33 over a rather limited range of @xmath24 .",
    "this was explained by invoking a dense distribution of trap states , which acted as an `` impurity band '' , although the origin or the physical location of such traps are unclear .    in contrast to the nanopatches ,",
    "@xcite the @xmath24-dependence of @xmath33 in our mono and trilayer mos@xmath0 devices are not activated , but there are two distinct regimes in the @xmath24-variation in @xmath33 ( figs .",
    "3a and 3b ) : the high-@xmath24 regime ( @xmath41  k ) , where @xmath33 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath24 , and second , the low-@xmath24 regime ( @xmath42  k ) , where the variation in @xmath33 weakens considerably at most @xmath17 in both devices ( except for mos1la at low @xmath17 , where the weakening of @xmath33 sets in at higher @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "we find that in the high @xmath24 regime , the variation of @xmath33 with @xmath24 can be modeled very well in terms of variable range hopping ( vrh ) transport rather than the thermally activated behaviour with @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath44 are correlation energy scale and dimensionality ,  @xcite respectively , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "the agreement of the data to vrh transport with @xmath47 indicates the electron transport in atomically thin mos@xmath0 to occur in a wide ( @xmath48 ) band of localized states , rather than direct excitation to conduction band minimum or mobility edge from the fermi energy as suggested for the nanopatches .",
    "@xcite the vrh transport in @xmath33 also results in @xmath49 in two dimension .",
    "@xcite this is confirmed in the inset of fig .",
    "3b for the mos1la device .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 decreases rapidly as @xmath17 , or equivalently , the fermi energy @xmath50 , is increased .",
    "such a behavior is common to strongly localized 2d electron systems ,  @xcite and implies that @xmath50 is located in the conduction band tail .",
    "to understand the weakening of @xmath33 at @xmath42  k , we have magnified this regime for both mos3l ( fig .",
    "3c ) and mos1la ( fig .",
    "3d ) . in both cases ,",
    "the variation of @xmath33 with @xmath17 becomes nonmonotonic , and displays several peaks which become progressively well defined as @xmath24 is reduced .",
    "the peaks are highly reproducible , and stable even at @xmath51  k , indicating that random fluctuations due to interference of hopping paths are unlikely to cause them .",
    "resonant tunneling at the localized states in disordered mesoscopic semiconductors is known to result in strong reproducible peaks in @xmath33 at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite in the presence of multiple overlapping resonances , @xmath24 dependence of @xmath33 weakens as observed in our data .",
    "@xcite however , confirmation of this scenario can be obtained by shifting the resonance peaks using finite @xmath20 .",
    "for this , we focused on a small interval of @xmath17 ( @xmath52  v ) near pinch - off where a number of isolated resonances could be identified . in the @xmath53 plane , this leads to diamond - like pattern in differential conductivity @xmath54 ( inset : fig 3c ) .",
    "the occurrence of transport resonances indicates a rather inhomogenous charge distribution in mos@xmath0 films , possibly puddles of charge near conduction threshold , through which charging events at the localized states couple to the metal contacts .",
    "we now turn into the key issue here that concerns the origin of localized states in ultrathin mos2 films .",
    "this requires an understanding of the origin of disorder in such systems , for which we first examine the values of @xmath2 . however , to compare @xmath2 for different devices , we define a device - specific reference voltage @xmath55 close to the `` pinch - off '' voltage in @xmath56 curve , so that the difference @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath50 or number density @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "4a , we have plotted the variation of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath58 for all the devices .",
    "the striking feature here is the close agreement of @xmath2 in both absolute magnitude and energy over nearly three decades , irrespective of independent preparation of devices , varying layer number , mobility and device geometry @xmath7 .",
    "this indicates a very similar disorder landscape in all devices that reflects comparable magnitude and energy dependence of localization length @xmath59 and density of states @xmath60 .",
    "disorder arising from defects in bulk of the mos@xmath0 films are unlikely to explain the insensitivity of @xmath2 to number of layers since screening of impurities and density of defect in bulk are expected to strongly influence the density of localized states . in stead ,",
    "our data indicates a common external origin of disorder , such as the trapped charges in the substrate .",
    "this is also supported by recent transport experiments ,  @xcite where higher mobility of thin mos@xmath0 flakes could be achieved by changing electrostatic environment alone .",
    "indeed a charge trap - induced disorder can readly explains the observed magnitude of @xmath2 . to illustrate this",
    "we take @xmath61 as the typical size of the puddles , which for mos3l can be roughly estimated to be @xmath62  nm from the charging energy ( @xmath63  mev ) at @xmath64  v ( corresponding to @xmath65  v ) ( see inset of fig .",
    "taking @xmath66  ev@xmath67@xmath68 as the typical surface density of charge traps at sio@xmath0 interface ,  @xcite and using @xmath69 , we find @xmath70  k , which is in good agreement to the observed magnitude from vrh data ( fig .",
    "this leads us to suggest that the physical origin of the localized states in ultra - thin mos@xmath0 films is connected to the random potential fluctuations from the trapped charges at the mos@xmath0-sio@xmath0 interface .",
    "( see the schematic of fig .  4b . )",
    "the screening of these trapped charges will be poor due to the large bandgap of mos@xmath0 ( unlike graphene ) and hence can lead to a considerably long band tail .",
    "it is likely that the interfacial traps are randomly occupied during processing of the devices , predominantly @xmath10 transfer of electrons from the exfoliated prestine mos@xmath0 layers , and subsequently form the frozen disorder landscape since most experiments are conducted at low @xmath24 .    finally to confirm the charge impurity induced disorder ,",
    "we have examined the nature of scattering of carriers by defects at high @xmath17 and @xmath24 so that the electron wavefunctions are nearly extended .",
    "if the main source of disorder arises from the randomly occupied interfacial traps , one would expect the scattering to be dominated by charge impurity scattering , which for two - dimensional electron systems with parabolic energy bands will lead to ,  @xcite    @xmath71    in fig .",
    "5a , b and c , we have shown the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath58 ( @xmath72 ) near room temperature , for the single , bi and tri layer mos@xmath0 devices , respectively . in all monolayer mos@xmath0 devices , as well as the bilayer ( mos2l ) case ,",
    "we find @xmath73 indicating scattering from nearly unscreened charged impurities . in the trilayer device ( mos3l ) , the variation in @xmath74 is somewhat slower , indicating partial screening of the charge impurities .",
    "assuming the electronic density of states to be approximately one - tenth of the free electron density of states at maximal doping @xmath75 used in our experiment the debye screening length in our devices can be estimated to be @xmath76 , which is nearly three molecular layers of mos@xmath0 .",
    "this readily explains the bare charge impurity scattering in single and bi - layer mos@xmath0 , while charge impurities are partially screened for the trilayer device .",
    "it is then natural to draw an analogy of our findings to other heavily researched exfoliated atomic scale transistors in particular , graphene and topological insulators .",
    "the ubiquity of surface trap states probably constitutes a generic source of disorder in such ultra - thin field effect devices . reducing substrate traps , for example , by using crystalline substrates such as graphene on boron nitride ,",
    "may improve the quality of these systems considerably . a suspended device , as in case of graphene , could also lead to extremely high mobilities .",
    "we have studied low temperature electrical transport in mono , bi and trilayer mos@xmath0 transistor exfoliated onto si / sio@xmath0 substrates .",
    "we find that the electrons in all cases are localized well upto room temperature at most gate voltages , and displays variable range hopping transport as temperature is lowered .",
    "we showed that the disorder is likely to arise from coulomb potential of randomly distributed charges at the mos@xmath0-sio@xmath0 interface , and hence highly improved devices should be possible with appropriate substrate engineering .",
    "* device fabrication *    mos@xmath8 flakes were exfoliated from bulk mos@xmath0 ( spi supplies ) using scotch tape on sio@xmath0 ( 300  nm)/n@xmath77 si wafer .",
    "to keep the disorder level comparable , the wafers were thoroughly cleaned by standard rca cleaning followed by acetone and isopropyl alcohol cleaning in ultrasonic bath .",
