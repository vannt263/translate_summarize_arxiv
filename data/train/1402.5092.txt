    "the simplest generalization of the classical random walk ( @xmath1 ) @xcite to the quantum domain is the one - dimensional discrete time quantum random walk ( @xmath0 ) @xcite based on two - level systems ( qubits ) @xcite . in this model the qubit moves one step to the right or to the left according to its internal degree of freedom ( spin state ) . if its spin is up , for example , it moves to the right and if its spin is down it moves to the left . at each step of the walk a unitary operation ( `` quantum coin '' )",
    "@xmath2 is applied to the qubit s internal degree of freedom prior to the action of the displacement operator @xmath3 , which moves the qubit as described above .",
    "this apparently simple quantum dynamic model has transport properties completely different from its classical counterpart , the causes of which are mainly due to the principle of superposition of quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of @xmath0 creates a superposition among the position states ( external degree of freedom ) of the system , opening the way to interference effects to take place that ultimately determine the transport properties of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the position probability distribution @xmath4 for certain types of @xmath0 is far from being a gaussian distribution @xcite , as is the case for @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , for most @xmath0 we have a ballistic behavior for the displacement of the walker , i.e. , the variance @xmath5 of @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the number of steps of the walk . for @xmath1 , however , we have a diffusive behavior ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "another characteristic of @xmath0 is the generation of entanglement between the internal and external degrees of freedom of the qubit during its time evolution @xcite .",
    "this is a genuine quantum feature of @xmath0 since there is no analog to entanglement for @xmath1 .",
    "the transport and entanglement properties of @xmath0 were extensively studied for the ordered case @xcite , where the quantum coin is fixed throughout the time evolution or changes in time in a predictable way .",
    "most ordered @xmath0 have ballistic transport and their asymptotic ( long time ) entanglement is highly dependent on the initial condition of the walker and almost never reaches its maximal possible value .",
    "ordered @xmath0 has also proved useful in a possible implementation of quantum search algorithms @xcite , of a universal quantum computer @xcite , and in the simulation of dirac - like hamiltonians @xcite . for disordered @xmath0 , where the coin and/or the displacement operator is randomly chosen at each lattice site and/or time step , only the transport properties were studied in some depth @xcite . in this scenario , depending on the type of disorder , we can have diffusive or ballistic transport or anderson localization .",
    "the first systematic study of the entanglement properties of disordered @xmath0 was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where dynamic disorder was employed .",
    "a dynamically disordered @xmath0 is such that the coin @xmath2 is the same at all lattice sites but changes randomly at each time step ( see fig . [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the main results of @xcite and its supplemental material were analytical and numerical proofs that ( i ) the asymptotic entanglement between the position and the spin degrees of freedom are maximal and ( ii ) independent of the initial state of the walker .",
    "these facts were surprising for the introduction of noise ( disorder ) to @xmath0 enhanced its entangling power considerably for any initial condition , against naive expectations that noise would wash out the quantum features of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to dynamic disorder , there exist static and fluctuating disorder @xcite . in the static case the coins are fixed in time but randomly distributed along the lattice sites .",
    "fluctuating disorder combines both features of the dynamic and static case : the coins change randomly at each time step and at each lattice site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "so far , the only work studying the entanglement behavior of statically and dynamically disordered @xmath0 is ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown for only one initial condition and for a @xmath9-step walk that dynamic disorder outperforms both the ordered and the static case , with the latter giving the worst result .    what would happen , though , for other initial conditions ? what would one get by employing fluctuating disorder ? what sort of disorder is the most powerful entanglement generator ?",
    "how all these different types of disorder compare to the ordered case ?",
    "our main goal in this article is two answer the previous questions by systematically investigating the entangling power of @xmath0 subjected to dynamic , fluctuating , and static disorder .",
    "specifically , we want to test if all types of disorder lead to an asymptotic limit and how it is approached ( in case there is one ) .",
    "also , we want to determine the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement for these three types of disorder and also its dependence ( or independence ) on the initial conditions of the walker .",
    "let us start by presenting the notation and nomenclature employed in the rest of this article . following ref .",
    "@xcite we call a disordered @xmath0 a _ random quantum random walk _ , or @xmath10 for short .",
    "the extra @xmath11 simply reminds us that there is a new random aspect in the disordered case when compared to the ordered one , namely , the quantum coin changes in an unpredictable way .",
    "also , we will be dealing with walks where we either have only two or a continuum of quantum coins to play with . in order to keep track of these different situations , we call the former process @xmath12 and the latter @xmath13 , with the subscripts denoting that we have , respectively , two or an infinity of coins at our disposal .",

    "in this article we have addressed how different types of disorder affect the entangling power of the simplest quantum version of the one - dimensional classical random walk ( @xmath1 ) , namely , the discrete time quantum random walk ( @xmath0 ) , which is built on a single qubit that moves right or left according to its internal degree of freedom ( spin ) . during its walk , the internal degree of freedom of the system",
    "gets entangled with the external one ( position ) . for the ordered case ,",
    "this entanglement is highly sensitive to the initial conditions and almost never reaches the maximal value possible .    to introduce disorder in @xmath0",
    "we allow the quantum coin ( an @xmath33 unitary matrix ) to be randomly chosen at each time step and/or lattice position .",
    "following @xcite , this extra random aspect ( disorder ) led us to call such processes random quantum random walks ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the three types of disorder we investigated are called dynamic , fluctuating , and static disorder and they appear due to imperfections in the construction of the quantum coin and to inherently quantum fluctuations during the time evolution of the qubit .",
    "which one dominates a given @xmath10 depends on the interplay between the rate of the fluctuations in the system and the total time of the experiment .",
    "they were already implemented in the laboratory and the level and type of disorder present in the system can also be tuned to almost any desired value @xcite .    in dynamic @xmath10",
    "the quantum coins are the same throughout the lattice , changing randomly at each time step . in the static @xmath10 the quantum coins",
    "are fixed in time but are once randomly distributed along the lattice sites .",
    "fluctuating @xmath10 combines both features of the previous cases , the quantum coins change randomly at each time step and at each position .",
    "so far the entangling power of @xmath10 is only extensively known for dynamic disorder @xcite where , contrary to the ordered case , it leads asymptotically in the number of steps to maximally entangled states for any initial condition .",
    "little is known about the entangling power of static @xcite and fluctuating disorder . in this paper",
    "we filled this gap by investigating in depth the entangling power of the last two aforementioned types of disorder .    by means of extensive numerical studies for several thousands of initial conditions and many different levels of disorder , we showed that dynamic disorder is almost always the strongest entangler , being followed closely by fluctuating disorder .",
    "both types of disorder give maximally entangled states asymptotically and independently of the initial conditions .",
    "static disorder , however , leads to the worst results in terms of entanglement generation , being almost always worse than the ordered case . only when a low level of static disorder is added to the system",
    "does it outperform the ordered case , but still losing to the dynamic and fluctuating cases .",
    "also , the static @xmath10 has no asymptotic limit , with the long time value of entanglement fluctuating about a mean value with no signs of convergence to its mean .",
    "furthermore , the reduced density matrix describing the internal degree of freedom of the qubit fluctuates randomly among several different matrices , while for dynamic @xcite and fluctuating disorder it tends to a specific one ( to the asymptotic value @xmath189 ) .",
    "we have also studied the rate at which the asymptotic limit is approached , i.e. , the rate at which @xmath68 approaches its asymptotic value . as already noted for dynamic disorder @xcite",
    ", we observed that for fluctuating disorder the asymptotic limit is approached according to a power law , @xmath190 , whose exponent is the same as the one for dynamic disorder .",
    "for the ordered case we also have a power law but with different exponent , @xmath191 .",
    "putting together the results obtained here and in @xcite and its supplemental material , namely , ( i ) static disorder has no asymptotic limit and is the worst entanglement generator ; ( ii ) dynamic and fluctuating disorder give asymptotically maximally entangled states for any initial condition ; and ( iii ) deterministic / periodic time - dependent coins @xcite do not generate highly entangled states for all initial conditions , we are led to conclude that we must have at least the following two ingredients to produce quantum walks such that we get maximally entangled states for any initial condition : we must have time - dependent coins changing randomly throughout the time evolution . indeed , time - independence with position - dependent randomness ( static disorder ) or time - dependence with no randomness do not lead to maximal entanglement for all initial conditions . for dynamic and fluctuating disorder",
    ", however , where their common feature is time - dependent randomness , we do get maximally entangled states for any initial condition if we wait enough .",
