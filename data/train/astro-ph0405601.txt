    "the witten proposal that symmetric deconfined u , d , s - quark matter may be the absolute ground state of matter @xcite has aroused much interest , and the properties of strange stars have been widely studied since then .",
    "an important question is whether the observed compact stars are neutron stars or strange stars , which are made up of deconfined u , d , s quarks . with",
    "the launching of the new generation of x - ray detectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is becoming possible now to have accurate measurement of the radii and surface temperature of compact stars @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical calculations using the mit bag model equation of state ( eos ) show that the mass and size of a strange star are comparable to those of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "hence it is important to identify other observables that can be used to distinguish a strange star from neutron star .",
    "one possibility is to study the cooling of an isolated compact star .",
    "the cooling curves of quark matter and neutron matter are found to be significantly different due to the difference in their thermal properties and energy loss mechanisms @xcite .    in this paper , we study the effects of the qcd phase transition on the cooling of a compact star and possible signatures of the quark phase .",
    "regardless of the validity of witten s proposal , the formation of quark - gluon plasma should be favoured in high temperature and density @xcite ; we therefore suggest that a strange quark star may be formed just after a supernova explosion , in which both conditions may be satisfied @xcite . because the initial temperature is so high @xcite @xmath3 mev , the initial compact star is likely to be a bare strange star @xcite .",
    "when it cools down to the phase transition temperature @xmath4 , the quark matter may become energetically unstable compared to nuclear matter , and the strange star will convert to a neutron star . during the phase transition ,",
    "a large amount of latent heat , of the order @xmath5 erg , can be released , which can be a possible energy source of gamma ray bursts ( grb s ) .",
    "the latest lattice qcd calculations of @xmath4 @xcite indicate , though with relatively large uncertainties at high chemical potential , that @xmath6 drops from its zero density value of 140 mev to about 50 mev at 1.5 times nuclear matter density @xmath7 and down to a few mev for density a few times @xmath8 .",
    "some previous proto - neutron star evolution calculations indeed show that it is feasible to reach the phase transition in supernovae @xcite . while there are still large uncertainties in both high density qcd and the proto - neutron star evolution , we believe it is worthwhile to study the possible consequences of the qcd phase transition in supernovae . we assume a constant @xmath4 in density throughout the star and present results for @xmath9 mev for comparison .",
    "we adopt the simple picture that matter at temperature above ( below ) @xmath4 is in the quark ( hadronic ) phase .",
    "it has been argued that the rapid cooling of strange stars by pion and @xmath10 pair production can be a power source of grb s @xcite .",
    "however , if the qcd phase transition is not considered , the temperature of the compact star drops rapidly and the duration of the burst ",
    "being less than @xmath11 s  is too short to account for long duration grb s . in our model",
    ", the star stays at the phase transition temperature for a relatively long time , and the photon luminosity is maintained in the range @xmath12 with duration @xmath13  s up to @xmath14  s ( or even longer ) , which is consistent with both long and short grb s .",
    "thus the latent heat may solve the problem of the energy supply of grb s .",
    "another signature of quark stars that has been discussed is the relatively low luminosity of @xmath0-rays when the quark star cools down @xcite .",
    "our model shows that the luminosity in the @xmath0-ray range can be as high as @xmath15with a very long duration of @xmath16 s , which is much longer than the case considered by page and usov @xcite .",
    "the satellite @xmath17 launched recently is just sensitive to @xmath0-rays in the energy range of interest .",
    "if a long duration @xmath0-ray source is detected , it could be a signature of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of a strange star to neutron star phase transition is the emission of a second neutrino burst after the supernova explosion .",
    "a similar scenario was also proposed in aguilera @xmath18 @xmath19 s work @xcite , but with a different physical mechanism . in our model , the burst is due to the phase transition from a quark star to a neutron star , which has a higher neutrino emissivity . in aguilera",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 s work , the burst is due to the trapping of neutrinos when the temperature is high , which are then released suddenly when the quark star cools .",
    "nevertheless , both works suggest that a second neutrino burst is a signature of the existence of quark stars .",

    "various eos s have been used to study the properties of strange stars .",
    "the most widely used one is the mit bag model due to its simple analytic form @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that it is difficult to distinguish the strange stars described by the mit bag model from neutron stars due to the similiarities in their maximum mass @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is a solar mass ) and radius @xmath22 km @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fraga @xmath18 @xmath23 @xcite studied quark star structure by using the eos of perturbative qcd for cold , dense quark matter up to order @xmath24 , using a modern determination of the running of the coupling constant .",
    "their results show that strange stars can have a radius of about @xmath25 km and a mass of a typical neutron star , and such a small compact star can actually be distinguished from neutron stars . since the strong coupling constant becomes small in the high density limit , perturbative qcd may be a fair description of matter in the interior of a compact star .",
    "hence we follow fraga s work and examine in details the conditions of absolute and global stability of strange quark stars , as well as the effects of strange quark mass .",
    "it has been argued that perturbative qcd may fail to describe the matter at the surface of a strange star due to the strong coupling at low density .",
    "however , the main structure of a compact star is determined by matter properties in the high density regime . moreover ,",
    "it is worthwhile to study the dependence of compact star properties on models of eos .",

    "the conditions of chemical equilibrium are : @xmath32 @xmath33 together with the charge neutrality condition : @xmath34 the thermodynamic properties will be determined by one independent choice of chemical potential only , which we have chosen to be @xmath35 in our calculations .",

    "[ fig : pvse ] .",
    "it turns out that this eos is very similar to the mit bag model eos , with an effective bag constant @xcite , and we would have obtained basically the same results using the latter .",
    "none of our results in the cooling calculation depends on the validity of perturbative qcd in the compact star regime .",
    "a strong condition for strange quark matter to be the absolute ground state of cold matter is that the energy per baryon at zero pressure @xmath60(0 ) is less than that of @xmath61fe : @xmath62 the upper panel of fig .",

    "electrons are not needed to maintain the charge neutrality @xcite .",

    "electrons or positrons may still be present near the surface of a quark star , and they are important for its cooling behaviour .",
    "more detailed discussion of the effect of massive strange quarks and its physical implications can be found in ref .",
    "it has long been suggested that strange stars can be formed from a phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars due to an abrupt increase in density @xcite .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , formation of quark - gluon plasma is favoured when both temperature and chemical potential are high enough @xcite .",
    "hence it is reasonable to suggest that strange stars are formed in supernovae where both high temperature and density are achieved @xcite .",
    "if the strange quark matter is absolutely stable for high density and zero temperature , i.e. , @xmath87 , the quark star will remain in the quark phase even when it cools down .",

    "whether a phase transition can occur and how much energy is released depend on both the eos s of quark matter and nuclear matter .",
    "we are interested in the possibility that strange quark matter is only stable for @xmath93 , and so we choose a @xmath94 , so that when the hot strange star cools to low temperature , it will convert to a neutron star . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the maximum gravitational mass is @xmath96 with a baryonic mass of @xmath97 and radius 8.54 km .",
    "we will use this set of parameters in the calculation of the cooling behaviour because the maximum mass is close to observational data of compact stars .",
    "in fact , we have used other values of @xmath55 , and the cooling behaviour is qualitatively similar , as long as the star undergoes a phase transition .",
    "the cold eos of the neutron stars will only determine the conversion energy .",
    "the cooling behaviour is determined by the cooling mechanisms and heat capacities in our calculations .",

    "a typical neutron star with @xmath98 and @xmath99 is chosen @xcite in the cooling calculations . for comparision ,",
    "the energy released for different @xmath55 , together with several commonly used neutron star eos s are summarized in table [ table : cooling : conv ] . for @xmath100 , typically @xmath5 erg is released during the process , which depends only weakly on the nuclear matter eos .",
    "we propose that it can be an energy source of gamma ray bursts ( grb s )  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that in an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision , a hot quark - gluon plasma is formed initially , which then cools down to the phase transition temperature @xmath4 and goes into the mixed phase , if the qcd phase transition is first order .",
    "when all the quark matter has hadronized , the temperature drops again @xcite .",
    "we borrow this idea to describe the cooling of a strange star .",
    "when the strange star is born , the temperature can be as high as a few times @xmath101 k @xcite . the surface is so hot that all the materials , other than strange - quark matter , are evaporated leaving the strange star nearly bare without any crust @xcite .",
    "since the thermal conductivity of strange quark matter is very high and the density profile of the strange star is very flat , we will take the uniform temperature and density approximation .",
    "hence the strange star cools down according to the equation : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the total heat capacity of all the species in quark matter , and @xmath104 is the total luminosity of the star .",
    "when the temperature drops to @xmath4 , the strange star undergoes a phase transition and a latent heat @xmath89 is released .",
    "we simply take @xmath4 to be constant in density throughout the star , which has a much smaller value than the zero chemical potential value of about 150 mev because of the high chemical potential . during the phase transition",
    ", we assume that the quark and neutron matter are distributed uniformly and calculate the luminosity of the mixed phase by the weighted average of that of the quark matter and the neutron matter [ section  [ section : pt ] ] .",
    "when the strange star has lost all its latent heat and converted completely to a neutron star , it then follows the standard cooling of a neutron star with an initial temperature of @xmath4 .",
    "the detailed thermal evolution is governed by several energy transport equations .",
    "we adopt a simple model that a neutron star has a uniform temperature core with high conductivity and two layers of crust , the inner crust and the outer crust , which transport heat not as effectively as the core or quark matter .",

    "it has been argued that for quark matter , even with unequal quark masses , in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase in which all the three flavors and colors are paired , quark matter is automatically charge neutral and no electrons are required @xcite .",
    "however , for sufficiently large strange quark mass and the relatively low density regime near the stellar surface , the 2 color - flavor superconductor ( 2sc ) phase is expected to be preferred .",

    "we simply treat the luminosities of both contributions to be : @xmath199      the plasma frequency is related to the baryon number density as @xcite : @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the chemical potential . hence : @xmath202 for a typical strange star , @xmath203 mev . therefore during the phase transition , the plasma frequency will be related to the fraction of quark number as : @xmath204 the luminosity of thermal equilibrium photons during the phase transition is given by eq.([eq : cooling : eq_radiation ] ) where @xmath205 .",
    "we can see that the lower limit becomes smaller during the phase transition .",
    "the luminosity reduces to that of thermal blackbody radiation at the end of the phase transition .",
    "hence we expect an increase of equilibrium photon luminosity as a signature of the phase transition .      from eq.([eq :",
    "cooling : qurca ] ) , the neutrino emissivity of a quark star @xmath206 .",
    "hence , @xmath207      for the neutrino emissivity of neutron matter , we use the fractional density of neutron matter in the density dependent terms of eq.([eq : cooling : durca ] ) and ( [ eq : cooling : bras ] ) , i.e. : @xmath208 for the electron - proton coulomb scattering of eq.([eq : cooling : crust ] ) , we simply calculate its contribution with a weighted mean : @xmath209 lattimer @xmath18 @xmath19 have pointed out that direct urca process can only be switched on in a neutron star at sufficiently high central density @xcite . for a wide range of parameters ,",
    "the required central density is of the order of nuclear matter density .",
    "we switch on the direct urca process only when the average density of neutron matter is above the nuclear matter density .",
    "since the non - equilibrium blackbody radiation is not the dominating cooling mechanism in the temperature range of @xmath210  k , it can be neglected in the mixed phase .",
    "when a strange star is born just after the stellar collapse , its temperature is very high @xmath211 k @xmath212 mev  @xcite .",
    "we choose an initial temperature @xmath213  mev .",
    "the eos of perturbative qcd with massless quarks and temperature correction up to first order in @xmath77 is @xcite : @xmath214.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since just after the collapse , @xmath215 mev @xmath216 mev at the surface , the zero temperature eos is appropriate for calculating the structure of the star . in our cooling model ,",
    "the only free parameter of the eos in the quark phase is @xmath45",
    ". it will determine whether a phase transition can occur and how much latent heat can be released . for a @xmath217 compact star ,",
    "the cooling curves are mainly affected by the cooling mechanisms and heat capacities of the material , rather than @xmath45 , which mainly affects the structure of the compact star .",
    "therefore we only choose one value of this parameter , @xmath218 , for the cooling calculations .",
    "the phase transition temperature @xmath4 involves detailed study of the baryon phase diagram , which is still highly uncertain .",
    "the latest results @xcite indicate that @xmath4 drops from its zero density value of 140 mev to a few mev for density of a few times nuclear matter density .",
    "hence we treat @xmath4 as a parameter and study the cooling behaviours for different @xmath4 .",
    "we assume a constant @xmath4 in density throughout the star and present results for @xmath219  mev for comparision .",
    "the remaining ingredients are the heat capacities and cooling mechanisms of the star . for the quark phase ,",
    "the urca process , thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium radiation are believed to occur for a bare strange star .",
    "we include all these processes in our calculations , and we choose other combinations of cooling processes to investigate the effect of each cooling mechanism . for the superfluid phase of quark matter , we choose @xmath220 mev for a small gap model and @xmath221 mev for a large gap model .",
    "the various models presented in this paper are summarized in table  [ model ] .",
    "the strange star luminosity @xmath222 discussed above is typically many orders of magnitude higher than @xmath223 erg / s and may be as high as @xmath5 erg / s . in this case , the outflowing wind is optically thick , and at @xmath224 erg / s the spectrum of emergent photons is nearly a blackbody spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a new born strange star , the pion production , equilibrium radiation , and electron - positron pair production can not be distinguished observationally in spite of the fact that the characteristic gamma - ray energies at these processes near the strange star surface differ significantly .",
    "they can be distinguished observationally only if the phase transition temperature is very low , such that the strange star can exist in a relatively low temperature .",
    "the observables are the luminosity and the surface temperature at infinity , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , which are related to the stellar surface values , @xmath222 and @xmath110 @xcite : @xmath227 @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the gravitational redshift at the stellar surface .",
    "the various cooling curves for different models are shown in fig .",
    "8.1 - 8.4 .",
    "models a to c are small superfluid gap models , while models d to f are large superfluid gap models . for small ( large ) superfluidity gap models ,",
    "the phase transition temperature considered here is well above ( below ) the superfluid gap .",
    "we can get some insight of the effect of superfluidity on the signatures of phase transition .",
    "the cooling curves for model a and model b are nearly the same .",
    "it is because both of them have the same thermal properties , and all the cooling mechanisms are switched on , except for model a that the @xmath10 pair production is not considered .",
    "since for the small superfluid gap @xmath230 mev , pion emission is not suppressed for @xmath231 .",
    "the pion emissivity dominates the @xmath10 pair production by several orders of magnitude at high temperature . at low temperature",
    ", the cooling process will be dominated by the blackbody radiation .",
    "hence both models will be dominantly cooled by the same mechanisms and have the same cooling history .",
    "only if the phase transition temperature is very low , we can distinguish them by studying the spectrum , in which model b shows the character of @xmath10 production . in these models , for @xmath232 mev , the photon luminosity can maintain up to @xmath233 erg s@xmath234 for about 1 s when the star is in the quark and mixed phases .",
    "such a ` long ' duration of extremely high luminosity , compared to ng @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 s model which gives a luminosity that drops below @xmath235 erg s@xmath234 within 0.01 s in the extreme case ,",
    "is dominated by pion emission and maintained by the latent heat of the star .",
    "this violent fireball easily supplies the energy required for grb s .",
    "the neutrino luminosity drops from @xmath236 to @xmath237 erg s@xmath234 within @xmath238 s and then rises to @xmath239 erg s@xmath234 during the mixed phase which lasts for @xmath240 s.    this scenario of a second burst of neutrinos can be compared to two previous similar proposals @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the burst is due to the phase transition from a quark star to a neutron star , which has a higher neutrino emissivity , whereas in previous proposals , the second burst accompanies the phase transition from a neutron star to a quark star . in benvenuto s theory , the phase transition is delayed by a few seconds after the core bounce due to the presence of the neutrinos @xcite . in aguilera",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 s theory @xcite , the burst is due to the initial trapping of neutrinos when the temperature is high and their sudden release when the quark star cools .",
    "if quark matter is not as stable as nuclear matter at low temperature , then there should be yet another phase transition back to nuclear matter , which is what we focus on , and the `` second '' neutrino burst we propose is then the `` third '' neutrino burst",
    ".    if multiple neutrino bursts are observed , as may indeed be the case for the kamiokande data for sn1987a @xcite , whether the compact star changes from the quark phase to neutron phase ( our model ) or the other way around can be distinguished observationally in at least two ways .",
    "first , our model predicts that the cooling is much faster _ before _ the phase transition , but it will become slower _ after _ it .",
    "second , the size of the post - phase - transition compact star , being a normal neutron star , would be larger in our model .    for @xmath241 mev",
    ", the high photon luminosity can only be maintained for @xmath242 s , since the neutrino luminosity is very high during the phase transition , in which it releases the latent heat within a short time .",
    "the rises in neutrino flux are about two orders of magnitudes , but the time scale is so short that they are likely to be masked by the diffusion time of neutrinos ( @xmath243 s)@xcite out of the dense medium and therefore probably indistinquishable from the first burst .    we have also studied the case of @xmath244  mev ( not shown in the figures ) . the photon luminosity can be maintained at @xmath245 erg s@xmath234 up to @xmath246 s , and it then decreases gradually to @xmath247 erg s@xmath234 in @xmath248 s , while the neutrino luminosity first drops to @xmath247 erg s@xmath234 and then rises to @xmath249 erg s@xmath234 during the mixed phase .",
    "if such a long duration @xmath0-ray source exists , it will be difficult to be explained by other models . for our model with @xmath250  mev (",
    "not shown ) , the cooling history is similar , but with an even longer duration and lower luminosities in the mixed phase .",
    "the cooling curves ( of all our models ) are basically cooling of a bare quark star plus that of a neutron star .",
    "when the quark star cools to the phase transition temperature , the cooling curve switches from that of the quark star to the neutron star , plus a phase transition epoch .",
    "we can see that for a typical bare quark star without phase transition , the photon luminosity , as well as the surface temperature , are higher than that of the neutron star in the early epoch .",
    "the quark star then cools much faster than the neutron star , and it will be too cold to be observed . for the cooling of a bare quark star with phase transition , there is a significant feature different from the case without phase transition .",
    "when the quark star cools to the phase transition temperature , it remains at the phase transition temperature , and it releases the latent heat for a long time depending on the latent heat and the total luminosity .",
    "the total luminosity actually depends on the temperature .",
    "this means that the higher the phase transition temperature , the larger the luminosity and hence the shorter the duration of the phase transition .",
    "the latent heat depends on the choice of the eos s of both the quark and neutron matter , as well as the mass of the compact star .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath218 for quark matter , the hfv eos for neutron matter and a compact star mass of @xmath251 .",
    "the latent heat is hence @xmath252 erg .      for model c ,",
    "the thermal properties are the same as models a and b. in this model , the pion emissivity is not considered , and the dominating cooling process in the early epoch is the @xmath10 production .",
    "hence the photon luminosities for model c in the early epoch is significantly lower , and the durations of phase transition for high @xmath4 models are longer . for @xmath232 mev ,",
    "the photon luminosity drops from @xmath5 to @xmath237 erg s@xmath234 and can maintain such a high luminosity up to @xmath14 s. such a model seems to be in good agreement with long duration grb s both in the energy and time scales .",
    "for @xmath241 mev , the cooling curves are similar to those of model a and b , except for the lower photon luminosity with a slight rise near the end of the phase transition in model c. the similarity in cooling curves is due to the same dominating cooling mechanism of neutrino emission at the high temperature epoch in the quark and mixed phase , as well as the same cooling behaviour after the phase transition .",
    "we have again studied the case for @xmath244  mev ( not shown in the figure ) , the photon luminosity can be maintained up to @xmath253 erg s@xmath234 for @xmath254 s. this model is similar to page and usov s work @xcite , but our work can maintain a high luminosity for much longer time .",
    "the late and phase transition epoch of the cooling curve for @xmath250  mev ( not shown in the figure ) are the same as those of models a and b at the same @xmath4 .",
    "it is because for temperature @xmath255  mev , the dominating cooling mechanisms in all models ( including models d - e as well ) in the quark and mixed phases are non - equilibrium blackbody radiation .",
    "as compared to models a and b , the cooling curves for models d and e are also nearly identical .",
    "it is because the main effect of a large superfluid gap is to suppress pion and neutrino emissivities , which are important for the high temperature epoch .",
    "hence the @xmath10 production dominates the photon luminosity in the early epoch .",
    "thus both models are dominantly cooled by the same mechanisms .",
    "we can see that the effect of superfluidity is to make the neutrino bursts more distinct . for @xmath241 mev , the neutrino flux rises by over ten orders of magnitudes within a small fraction of second .",
    "the effect may again be masked by the diffusion of neutrinos .",
    "however , if @xmath4 is as low as 1 mev , the two bursts of similar flux can be separated by as long as @xmath256 s , which should be observable by modern neutrino observatories .      in model",
    "f , @xmath10 production is not considered .",
    "although pion emissivity is included , it is again greatly suppressed . hence the cooling history is as if there is no fast cooling mechanism .",
    "the quark star cools slowly , maintaining a relatively low photon luminosity for @xmath257 s for @xmath232 mev .",
    "one special feature of this model is that the photon luminosity rises up for about six orders of magnitudes at the end of the phase transition for @xmath232 mev .",
    "this is due to the increase in luminosity of thermal equilibrium radiation during the phase transition [ section [ section : pt ] ] . indeed for model a - e ,",
    "if we separate the spectrum of thermal equilibrium radiation from other photon luminosities , it is also increasing . in our models",
    ", we expect more photons to be released during the phase transition .",
    "the duration is @xmath22 s in this model and are shorter for other models . if such a burst is observed , it will be a unique feature which is difficult to be explained by other models .",
    "we remark here that detailed radiative transfer calculation may kill or lower the peak of this burst due to the surface effect of the star .",
    "another special feature of this model is that for all models a - e ( except model c ) , the second neutrino burst starts within  1 s from the first burst , which may be too short to be detected .",
    "this agrees with the observational data of sn1987a @xcite ( we emphasis here that base on the one event and the very few neutrinos detected , we really can not tell how many neutrino bursts are there ) . in model  f , the second neutrino burst starts after @xmath258 seconds .",
    "such a delayed neutrino burst may be detectable , and it may have significant effects on the propagation of shock waves in supernova remnants @xcite .      in these models",
    ", we can see that the size of superfluid gap determines how a compact star cools in the early epoch .",
    "pion emission is a very efficient cooling mechanism if the superfluid gap is small .",
    "if the superfluid gap is large , @xmath10 production will dominate in the early epoch .",
    "also we find that a second neutrino burst is a signature of the phase transition , if the neutrino emissivity in the neutron phase is higher than that of the quark phase . in our models ,",
    "the urca process in a neutron star makes the second neutrino burst possible .",
    "we studied the global structure and stability of strange stars with the perturbative qcd eos up to order @xmath40 .",
    "we find that for @xmath259 , strange quark matter is absolutely stable , while for @xmath260 , a strange star is globally stable ( compared to a neutron star ) .",
    "the effect of strange quark mass to the strange star is also studied . for a strange quark mass @xmath261 mev ,",
    "the correction to the maximum mass of strange stars is less than 3(10)% .",
    "we suggest that a strange star may undergo a phase transition to a neutron star when it cools down to some temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it has been argued that the rapid cooling of strange stars by pion emission can be a power source of grb @xcite .",
    "however , if the phase transition is not considered , the duration of the burst is too short , @xmath262 s , which can not explain long duration grb s , due to the rapid cooling without the maintenance of high temperature .",
    "however , in our model , the latent heat of the phase transition can supply the energy of the order @xmath5 erg . in our models ,",
    "the photon luminosities can be maintained in @xmath263 erg s@xmath234 with duration from @xmath264 up to @xmath14  s ( or even longer ) , which are in the range for both long and short @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "thus the latent heat solves the problem of the energy supply for the grb s .",
    "another signature for quark stars that has been discussed is the relatively low luminosity of @xmath0-rays when the quark star cools down @xcite . for models with low @xmath4 , e.g. model c with @xmath265  mev",
    ", the luminosity due to the @xmath10 pairs in the @xmath0-ray range can be as high as @xmath253 erg s@xmath234with a very long duration of @xmath16 s , which is much longer than the case considered by page and usov @xcite .",
    "the satellite @xmath17 launched recently is just sensitive to @xmath0-rays in the energy range of 15 kev - 10 mev .",
    "if long duration @xmath0-ray source is really detected , it would be a signature of the phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , if no such source is detected , this does not mean failure of our models .",
    "perhaps the phase transition temperature is very high , or the latent heat is small . indeed @xmath17 has already discovered a number of soft @xmath0-ray point sources in the center of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "oaknin and zhitnitsky have also discussed the possibility of the @xmath0-ray sources being supermassive very dense droplets ( strangelets ) of dark matter in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "if a second neutrino burst after a supernova explosion is detected , it will be a strong evidence for the existence of quark star , and in addition , it will support the switch on of urca process , or other fast neutrino emitting processes in neutron stars .",
    "however , the absence of the second burst does not kill quark stars , because there could simply be no fast neutrino emitting process in the neutron star phase , or the second burst arises so quickly that we can not distinguish it from the first one .",
    "it is generally believed that grb s are related to supernovae @xcite .",
    "our model is compatible to the supernova connection  a supernova explosion leaves behind a compact star , which triggers the grb weeks to years later .",
    "we suggest that the phase transition from a hot strange star to a neutron star may be the central engine of grb s . during the phase transition ,",
    "the size of the compact star increases , and an internal shock may develop , which initiates the grb .    in our models ,",
    "the phase transition is treated in an oversimplified manner .",
    "detailed study should be made which involves hydrodynamics , the eos , the emission properties of matter in the mixed phase and so on .",
    "also the duration of the quark phase may be so short that for the cooling process , the hydrostatic treatment of quark stars may not be appropriate .",
    "hydrodynamic simulation may be needed for the whole process starting from the supernova explosion .",
    "this involves detailed numerical treatment which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we discuss semi - quantitatively the signatures left during the phase transitions by the presence of the quark phase , if it is reached in supernovae .",
