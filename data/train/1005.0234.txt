    "+ for later convenience , it can be useful to recall that in mathematics scale invariance is tightly linked to the self - similarity of fractal curves and surfaces .",
    "+ finally , scale invariant quantum field theories generally describes massless particles .",
    "only , recently a new implementation of this symmetry has been suggested @xcite as a consequence of non - trivial fixed point in the infrared regime @xcite . in this new framework",
    "the intuitive notion of scale invariance as a property of massless particles only , has been extended to a new kind of stuff with no definite mass at all .",
    "for this reason , this presently unknown , scale invariant , sector of the elementary particle spectrum has been dubbed as the _ un - particle _ sector .",
    "+ the proposal is that below some critical energy scale @xmath1 the standard model particles can interact with un - particles .",

    "+ on the theoretical side , interesting connections between un - particles and non - standard kaluza - klein dynamics in extra - dimensions , and ads / cft duality , have been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "even deeper connections between un - gravity and trans - planckian physics are currently under investigation @xcite . finally , two of us ( p.g . and e.s . )",
    "have built an `` effective action '' for several kind of un - particle fields , including un - gravitons @xcite .",
    "encoding un - gravity into an effective action can be useful in view of studying gravitational effects @xcite beyond the weak field approximation .",
    "+ in this letter we show that the un - schwarzschild metric guessed in @xcite through perturbative arguments is an _",
    "exact _ solution of the field equations obtained from the effective theory introduced in @xcite .",
    "a non - trivial step in obtaining the solution is the introduction of a point - like source in the un - gravity einstein equations .",
    "+ in the final part of this communication we recover `` from scratch '' the area law for the un - schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the resulting expression for the area suggests the horizon to be a _ fractal _ surface of dimension twice the scale dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the physical system we are going to investigate is an `` hybrid '' of classical matter , classical gravity , and `` quantum '' un - gravity due to the exchange of un - gravitons .",
    "the action for this system is the sum of a classical functional @xmath3 for matter , and a _ non - local _ effective action @xmath4 smoothly extending the einstein - hilbert action to include un - gravitons dynamics .",
    "@xmath3 is the classical matter action for a massive , point - like , particle `` sitting '' in the origin .",
    "there is some freedom to choose the explicit for of this functional .",

    "the two interpretations are physically equivalent .",
    "+ now , the reader is probably thinking `` ... but , in the einstein field equations for the schwarzschild solution there is no energy - momentum tensor .",
    "schwarzschild geometry is a _ vacuum _ solution . ''",
    "it is a quite common misunderstanding to think that vacuum means `` in the absence of a source '' instead of _ outside _ a compact ( localized ) source . in the schwarzschild case ,",
    "the source is a point - like particle sitting in the origin .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor is given by @xcite            in equation ( [ linm ] ) the symbol @xmath27 indicates an indefinite integration .",

    "fractalisation _ of the event horizon .",
    "let us elaborate this picture by investigating the area law . + it is `` customary '' nowadays to assume that the black hole entropy is @xmath65 of the event horizon area in planck units , forgetting that this is a _ consequence _ of the first law of black hole thermodynamics and not a `` dogma '' to be blindly accepted .",
    "+ against this background , we start from                      thus , we feel confident to interpret eq.([unlaw ] ) as the extension of the area law for a fracatlised horizon of dimension @xmath64 .",
    "+ the analogy between tensor un - particle dynamics and physics in presence of fractal extra - dimension has been noted in @xcite in relation with multiplicity , temperature profile and decay rate of @xmath2 micro black holes .",
    "+ our result trace back these effects not to a formal analogy with black holes in higher dimensional spacetime , but to the fractal geometry of the event horizon itself .",
    "the out - coming picture is that if we imagine the event horizon as a null surface `` built - up '' of un - gravitons trapped at the schwarzschild radius , the underlying scale invariance of the theory manifests itself in the form of fractality , or self - similarity , of the horizon .",
    "+ the presence of a source in the effective einstein equations is instrumental to evaluate un - gravity corrections . in this paper",
    "we considered the simplest case of a point - like source leading to an `` eternal '' black hole type solution .",
    "an interesting problem is the study a collapsing body in order to see if and how un - gravity can change the dynamics of the collapse itself . even in the simplest case of a collapsing shell of matter",
    ", it is non - trivial to extend the israel matching formalism to the case of our effective , non - local , theory .",
    "thus , we postpone this study to a future investigation . a further prospect of pushing forward the study of un - particle fields in connection with gravity , we believe it would be interesting to build up an un - gravity action taking into account new gravitational degrees of freedom which drop out whenever we allow for dynamical torsion .",
    "this would lead to a richer spectrum and the un - particle sector might present some peculiar properties ."
