    "the chip was manufactured by the centre for integrated photonics@xcite on a 1mm - thick silicon wafer . a 10@xmath8m - thick layer of silica , grown by thermal oxidation , formed the lower cladding for the waveguides .",
    "a second layer of silica , doped with germanium and boron to achieve a 0.75% refractive index contrast , was created by flame hydrolysis deposition .",
    "this was etched through a uv - lithography mask to create the waveguide cores . a further 10@xmath8 m silica layer of upper cladding , also deposited by flame hydrolysis , was doped with boron and phosphorus in order to match the refractive index of the lower cladding .",
    "a layer of 50 nm of chrome and then 100 nm of gold provides the reflecting surface needed by the mot beams .",
    "finally the central trench was cut by deep reactive ion etching to a depth of 22@xmath8 m through a 16@xmath8m@xmath63500@xmath8 m rectangular mask formed by uv - lithography .",
    "the finished chip was polished on the back to reduce its thickness to 500@xmath8 m .",
    "this reduced the distance between the atoms in the trench and the current - carrying wires underneath .",
    "the chip is glued to a sub - chip , containing the current - carrying wires .",
    "these provide magnetic fields for manipulating the atoms , for example , the field parallel to the waveguides that is used in the experiments of fig .  [",
    "fig : zeeman ] .",
    "once the chip is attached to this base , a single - mode fibre ( non - polarisation - maintaining ) is brought to the polished edge of the chip and light is coupled into one of the waveguides , as can be seen by the scatter from defects in the trench .",
    "the whole chip is heated to 80  @xmath64c , and epotek 353nd index - matching adhesive is placed on the interface between the fibre and the chip .",
    "the fibre is realigned repeatedly during the 2-hour curing process , and the joint is reinforced with extra adhesive .",
    "we handled each fibre individually by gluing its last 20  mm to a v - groove in a titanium splint .",
    "this method allowed us to compensate for variations in concentricity of the fibre core .",
    "the procedure was repeated for each waveguide that was connected .",
    "the entire optical path from input fibre to output shows a 5% transmission .",
    "this is made up of 50% from each of the two vacuum feedthroughs , 60% from each fibre / waveguide interface , 78% at each face of the trench and 83% mode overlap where the expanded beam arrives at the second waveguide .",
    "if there is any cross - talk between the waveguides it is less than @xmath65 .",
    "the various interfaces in the optical train form several etalons that modulate the transmission by a few percent as the frequency varies .",
    "the light is transported by optical fibres to a single - photon counting avalanche photodiode .",
    "the counting rates in these experiments are between @xmath66 and @xmath67 counts per second , far above the background of @xmath68s@xmath19 from dark counts and stray light . at the high end , almost half the counts are lost to the 32ns dead time of the detector , which limits the rate .",
    "we extended the dynamic range by using calibrated filters to attenuate the light .",
    "we checked and confirmed the manufacturer s specified dead - time by measuring the noise as a function of intensity and comparing this with the poisson statistics appropriate for attenuated laser light .",
    "our measurements of absorption were taken over a number of shots , ranging from 30 to 600 .",
    "the apd signal was averaged , then smoothed over a 2ms window before taking the reading at the point in time where the atom density in the trench was at its maximum . for the polarisation measurements the large magnetic field needed time to settle after switching it on , and therefore we delayed the measurement point .",
    "each of these measurements was accompanied by a background measurement without atoms , which we averaged and used to normalise the absorption .",
    "the error bars are the @xmath69 statistical uncertainties of a poissonian photon source with detector dead time @xcite .",
    "light is at the saturation intensity @xmath23 when the photon scattering rate from one atom is @xmath70 . here",
    ", @xmath71 is the population decay rate of the upper state and is the same regardless of which magnetic sub - level is excited . among the @xmath43 transitions @xmath44 of @xmath6rb , the strongest are @xmath72 driven by @xmath45 light .",
    "both of these have @xmath73 .",
    "the relative strengths of the other transitions depend only on the squares of the 3-j symbols @xmath74 .",
    "a magnetic field is applied along the waveguides , so the light only has @xmath45 polarisations and the transitions are restricted to @xmath75 .    for the experiments in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ] , the atoms scatter several photons , even in the most weakly excited sub - level , and this ensures that the cloud is optically pumped . to a good approximation ,",
    "the resulting population distribution of @xmath42 states is the steady - state of the einstein rate equations .",
    "we calculate the mean scattering rate using that distribution .",
    "the calculation is repeated to average over all polarisations of the light because our measurements are an average over many shots , each with random polarisation .",
    "thus , we obtain an effective saturation intensity of @xmath76 .",
    "we acknowledge valuable discussions with benoit darqui and the technical expertise of jon dyne , stephen maine and valerijus gerulis , without whom the apparatus could not have been constructed .",

    "<S> the array is cut by a trench , where trapped atomic particles can interact with the light . </S>",
    "<S> the optical interaction regions are so small that a single atom obscures a significant fraction of the light , and there can be many such regions closely spaced . by demonstrating that these micro - fabricated atom - photon junctions are practical </S>",

    "<S> , we have released cold atoms into a junction to measure its sensitivity and to demonstrate the basics of its operation . </S>",
    "<S> every few seconds , @xmath6rb atoms are cooled and collected from a room - temperature vapour by a low - velocity intense source ( lvis ) , then transferred to a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) 3 mm from the chip surface , where the atom density is up to @xmath7 atoms/@xmath8m@xmath9 and the temperature is @xmath10k . </S>",
    "<S> we push this cloud towards the chip just before switching off the mot light and magnetic field , thereby launching the atoms at @xmath11cm / s into the trench . </S>",
    "<S> the light beams from the waveguides diverge only slightly as they cross the trench , with @xmath12 - the 1/e radius of the field - growing from @xmath13 m to @xmath14 m . since the width of the trench is @xmath15 m , </S>",
    "<S> any given beam interacts with roughly one atom of the cloud as it passes through . </S>",
