    "microwave dielectric materials strongly tunable by the application of an electric bias field are increasingly important for a variety of applications in microwave electronics , including tunable capacitors and oscillators , phase shifters , and delay lines.@xcite the dependence of dielectric constant @xmath2 on bias field @xmath3 is typically strongly non - linear , and a tunability parameter @xmath4 can be defined as @xmath5/\\epsilon(0)$ ] , where @xmath3 is an operational bias field of interest .",
    "because of the potential technological impact , considerable experimental effort has been directed toward the design , control , and optimization of highly tunable low - loss materials .    for many applications ,",
    "thin - film morphologies are required , and in recent years the growth of high - quality ultrathin perovskite films with unprecedented atomic - level control has become possible , using techniques such as molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite and pulsed - laser deposition ( pld ) .",
    "@xcite these efforts have achieved the growth of single - crystal films of nanometer - scale thickness with a minimum of defects .",
    "even so , the dielectric properties of these films often differ quite substantially from bulk@xcite .",
    "this difference is due to a number of factors , of which the strain in the film is in many cases among the most important .",
    "more specifically , the mechanical boundary conditions on a coherent epitaxial film require the in - plane lattice constant of the film to stretch ( or contract ) to match the lattice constant of the substrate .",
    "both experimental and theoretical studies have found that even small epitaxial strains can appreciably influence the curie temperature and the dielectric permittivity and tunability of batio@xmath0 , srtio@xmath0 , and ba@xmath6sr@xmath7tio@xmath0 ( bst ) thin films .",
    "@xcite    paraelectric bst at @xmath8 near 0.5 is already known to possess a large dielectric response and high tunability at room temperature , associated with close proximity to the ferroelectric phase transition at about @xmath9 k ( ref .  ) .",
    "however , significantly lower loss has been reported for single - crystal srtio@xmath10 ( sto ) thin films,@xcite possibly due to the absence of compositional disorder .",
    "the ground state of sto is nonpolar but nearly ferroelectric , and thus small applied stresses would be expected to have a significant influence on the curie temperature and associated susceptibilities .",
    "indeed , recent experimental studies@xcite indicate that significant changes in curie temperature and dielectric properties occure when sto is grown epitaxially on substrates with different lattice constants .",
    "one of the best - studied perovskite materials , pure sto is the subject of considerable experimental and theoretical literature .",
    "sto adopts the centrosymmetric cubic perovskite structure at room temperature , and undergoes a structural phase transition from the cubic to a tetragonal , nonpolar antiferrodistortive ( afd ) phase when cooled below 105 k.@xcite this transition , however , is observed to have little effect on the dielectric properties .",
    "cooling to still lower temperatures results in a strong curie - weiss - like increase in the static dielectric response , suggestive of a phase transition at about 20 k. however , no transition actually occurs in that temperature range ; instead , the dielectric constant saturates to a value of @xmath11 at zero temperature .",
    "@xcite the absence of the ferroelectric ( fe ) transition can be explained by quantum fluctuations of the atoms about their centrosymmetric cubic positions ( i.e. , the formation of a `` quantum paraelectric '' state ) .",
    "@xcite the proximity to a ferroelectric transition is also evident from experiments showing that modest uniaxial stress is capable of inducing ferroelectricity.@xcite several first - principles @xcite and classical monte - carlo simulations on an effective hamiltonian @xcite have already provided valuable insight into the structural properties and temperature dependence of fe phase transitions in bulk sto . in particular , the interaction between fe and afd instabilities in the bulk phase has been thoroughly studied from first principles by sai and vanderbilt.@xcite moreover , a previous phenomenological study of the effects of epitaxial strain on sto thin films by pertsev _",

    "@xcite based on a landau theory fit to experimental data from bulk phases , produced a rich temperature - strain phase diagram and provided support for the idea that the oxygen - octahedron rotations have little influence on the dielectric response .    in this work ,",
    "we compute the effects of the in - plane epitaxial lattice - matching constraint on the dielectric response and tunability of srtio@xmath10 using first - principles density - functional theory within the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we neglect the afd instabilities in all calculations .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to zero temperature , but for simplicity neglect the quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus , our focus will be on the ferroelectric soft mode and its coupling to strain . despite these restrictions ,",
    "the fact that we use a first - principles approach means that we do not have to rely on empirical landau parameters as in ref .  .",
    "thus , we can confidently make predictions under conditions that vary drastically from those under which the data determining the parameters were obtained , allowing us to consider the effects of large epitaxial strains and finite electric fields .",
    "there is one major limitation of our theory , connected with the fact that the lda tends to underestimate lattice constants .",
    "because compression tends to suppress ferroelectricity , this means that our lda system is `` less ferroelectric '' than true sto at zero temperature .",
    "indeed , we report below a soft - mode frequency of about 75 @xmath12 and a dielectric constant of about 390 at zero temperature for unstrained sto within the lda , whereas the experimental zero - temperature system is exquisitely close to the ferroelectric transition with @xmath13 @xmath12 and @xmath14.@xcite however , raising the temperature also has the effect of suppressing the ferroelectric instability , so that the experimental system _ at room temperature _ is characterized by @xmath15 @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus , fortuitously , the zero - temperature lda system corresponds reasonably well with the real physical system at a temperature near , or a bit below , room temperature .",
    "comparisons between these systems must obviously be approached with caution , but in fact we find good semiquantitative agreement for several of the physical properties of these two corresponding systems as will be presented below .",

    "the role of epitaxial strain on the structural properties of sto is isolated by systematically seeking the ground - state structure of five - atom unit cells of _ bulk _ sto constrained to several different in - plane lattice constants , differing from the theoretical cubic lattice constant by fractions ranging between @xmath223% and + 3% in steps of 0.5% , and allowing all atomic positions and the perpendicular lattice constant to relax fully until the energy is minimized . to locate the phase transition points , and for the electric field calculations , the in - plane lattice constant was varied in smaller steps of 0.1% in the paraelectric region .",

    "these numerical difficulties can be solved by identifying a subspace that spans , to a good approximation , the space of field - induced structural distortions , and then parameterizing the energy in this subspace .",
    "this modeling also helps us better understand the nonlinear effects of the field on the structure and dielectric properties .    to identify the relevant subspace ,",
    "we begin by finding the pattern of atomic displacements produced by an infinitesimal electric field ; it is obtained by multiplying the inverse of the force constant matrix @xmath63 with the forces @xmath64z@xmath65@xmath66 .",

    "our overestimate of the stability of the paraelectric phase can largely be attributed to the lda . specifically , since our zero - temperature calculations within the lda result in a slightly smaller lattice constant than experiment , and since the smaller volume stabilizes the paraelectric phase , our description of the bulk system yields a more stable paraelectric phase , as our underestimate of the bulk static dielectric constant attests ( calculated @xmath118 compared to the @xmath119 observed experimentally ) . in addition , octahedral rotations , not included in our analysis , might also alter the critical strain corresponding to the fe phase transitions in this region .",
