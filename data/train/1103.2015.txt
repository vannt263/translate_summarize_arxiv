    "note that @xmath111 for @xmath3 does not necessarily mean no zero energy edge states at @xmath102 . to be consistent with @xmath112 for @xmath3 at the same time",
    ", we need to have two zero energy edge states at @xmath102 .",
    "these two zero modes excellently agree with the two - fold degeneracy of the chiral majorana edge modes found in fig.[fig.3](a ) .",
    "now consider the case with a weak zeeman magnetic field . as was mentioned above",
    ", @xmath104 becomes ill - defined if we apply the zeeman magnetic field in the @xmath14-direction .",
    "thus , the number of the zero energy state at @xmath102 is determined solely by @xmath105 in this case .",
    "it is found that the remaining winding number @xmath105 takes the same value as that without the zeeman magnetic field , so for @xmath3 phase , the zero energy states at @xmath102 should vanish .",
    "this result excellently agrees again with the lifting of the degeneracy of the chiral majorana modes in fig.[fig.5](a ) .",
    "these winding numbers also explains why the degeneracy is not lifted off if the zeeman magnetic field is along the @xmath13 or @xmath89-direction : in these cases , @xmath104 remains well - defined , so the two degenerate zero modes also remain at @xmath102 .",

    "<S> we study the edge states for a quantum anomalous hall system ( qahs ) coupled with a spin - singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor through the proximity effect , and clarify the topological nature of them . </S>",
    "<S> when we consider a superconducting pair potential induced in the qahs , there appear topological phases with nonzero chern numbers , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where andreev bound states appear as chiral majorana edge modes . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the energy spectrum of the edge modes and the resulting local density of states . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the degenerate chiral majorana edge modes for @xmath3 are lifted off by applying zeeman magnetic field along the parallel to the interface or the shift of the chemical potential by doping . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the chiral majorana edge modes and its lifting are explained by two different winding numbers defined at the time - reversal invariant point of the edge momentum . </S>"
