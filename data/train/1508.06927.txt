    "communication noise is an unavoidable factor in the distributed consensus of networked multi - agent systems .",
    "it has been found in @xcite that the traditional protocol can not solve the consensus problem with the existence of the communication noise .",
    "therefore , how to effectively attenuate the noise effect becomes an interesting research topic .",
    "one popular idea is to employ a time - descending gain ( sometimes called the stochastic - approximation type gain ) in the consensus protocol . in the early study phase",
    ", many scholars investigated the stochastic consensus of first - order integral multi - agent systems with communication noises .",
    "for example , under the fixed topology case : the stochastic - approximation type gain was first employed to solve the mean square and almost sure consensus problems @xcite ; li and zhang proved that the mean square consensus can be achieved in the continuous - time domain if and only if the noise - attenuation gain satisfies the stochastic - approximation type condition @xcite ; some necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring the stochastic consensus with both communication noises and time delays in the discrete - time domain were presented in @xcite . under the switching topology case ,",
    "the stochastic - approximation type protocols were also proved to be effective in both the discrete - time domain @xcite and the continuous - time domain @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that for the continuous - time mean square leader - following consensus problem , the necessary and sufficient conditions of noise - attenuation gains can be slightly relaxed compared to the leaderless case @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned papers study the additive noise while the multiplicative noise has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the noise intensity is proportional to the state differences between agents . in particular ,",
    "if the state difference becomes zero , then the noise effect disappears .",
    "therefore , the protocol for solving multiplicative noises may not require the time - descending gain .",
    "a few recent results also provided the protocols for higher - order integral multi - agent systems with communication noises .",
    "for instance , it has been proved in @xcite that the stochastic - approximation type gain is still the necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring the mean square average consensus of second - order integral multi - agent systems under the fixed topology .",
    "further results regarding the switching topologies were presented in @xcite . for the general linear multi - agent system , there are also some attempts on solving the mean square consensus and the almost sure consensus under the fixed topology @xcite and the switching topology @xcite . however , there are still some limitations in the current study of higher - order integral multi - agent systems with communication noises .",
    "for example , all agents are required to have the same noise - attenuation gain in most existing publications , which implies that certain global information should be known by all agents ; and the convergence rate of the multi - agent system is rarely considered .",
    "motivated by the above observation , this note first modifies the consensus protocol for general continuous - time linear multi - agent systems proposed in @xcite . in the modified protocol , each agent",
    "is equipped with its own noise - attenuation gain .",
    "hence there is no need to assume that all agents have the same gain .",
    "it is proved that the mean square leader - following consensus can be reached by the modified protocol if all noise - attenuation gains are infinitesimal of the same order .",
    "it is interesting to find that for the leader - following consensus of general linear multi - agent systems , the stochastic - approximation type requirement on the noise - attenuation gains can be relaxed ( the square integrable condition is not necessary ) .",
    "next , the convergence rate of the multi - agent system under the modified protocol is presented .",
    "although the state - transition matrix has been explicitly obtained in @xcite ( under the assumption that all agents have the same noise - attenuation gain ) , the entire dynamical behavior of the multi - agent system can be determined by calculating the solution to the governing stochastic differential equation .",
    "it is still difficult to clearly tell the convergence rate of the multi - agent system since the solution to the governing stochastic differential equation is a very complicated function of noise - attenuation gains and the graph laplacian matrix .",
    "therefore it is more challenging to answer what is the convergence rate of the multi - agent system with the consideration of agent - dependent gains .",
    "fortunately , by some recent results in @xcite , if we assume that the noise - attenuation gain belongs to certain representative class of functions , then quantitatively determining the convergence rate becomes possible . in this note , if the noise - attenuation gain belongs to a class of functions bounded above and below by @xmath0 @xmath1 asymptotically , then the states of all follower agents are convergent in mean square to the leader s state with the rate characterized by a function bounded above by @xmath0 asymptotically .",
    "this convergence rate analysis is the main improvement of this note compared to the previous conference version @xcite .",
