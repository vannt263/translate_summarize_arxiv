    "<S> what sets the scale for the running coupling constant in this process ? as the particle flies along , it picks up small kicks from the medium , which change its direction , which is a form of acceleration , and so a source for bremsstrahlung . </S>",
    "<S> the individual kicks are dominated by relatively soft momentum scales for which @xmath2 is of order @xmath3 ( shown in red ) . but now consider the @xmath2 ( shown in blue ) associated with the emission of the bremsstrahlung gluon . </S>",

    "<S> the scaling of the stopping distance @xmath10 depends on the size of @xmath2 at these two scales @xmath11 and @xmath4 .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ weak coupling _ : if @xmath12 are both small , then @xmath13 ( up to logarithms ) . </S>",

    "<S> , people have found that the stopping distance has a different scaling with energy : @xmath19 @xcite .    in this article </S>",

    "<S> what is interesting about this result is its demonstration that the exponent @xmath20 in @xmath21 can depend on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the strong - coupling case has an even richer set of exponents than @xmath19 to describe jet stopping .     </S>",

    "<S> , one looks at the progress of the excitation through the medium by following some conserved density such as energy or momentum or charge density . for the purpose of this figure , it will be simplest if we think of charge density . as time passes , the charge density moves in a pulse that eventually slows down ( because of energy loss ) and then stops as the energy in the excitation thermalizes , after which the charge diffuses outward . </S>",

    "<S> evolution in time of a local excitation of some conserved charge created by a high - energy kick to the plasma . </S>",

    "<S> the string is initialized in a way that its end points fly apart , analogous to a high - energy back - to - back quark and anti - quark . </S>",
    "<S> as the ends fly apart , the string also falls in the fifth dimension towards the black brane horizon , as depicted by the time - series of curves , from top to bottom , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : string]a . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the string disturbs the background gravitational and other fields , and so causes a deformation of the fields on the boundary , as depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> as the string falls toward the horizon , its effect on the boundary becomes more and more red - shifted , and so spreads out to longer and longer wavelengths . </S>",

    "<S> there is one just slightly dissatisfying aspect of this very nice picture : the initial configuration of the system has been specified in the language of the gravity dual rather than directly in the 3 + 1 dimensional field theory . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to avoid this by finding a way to formulate some `` jet '' stopping problem from beginning to end in the field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will only use the gravity dual as a means to solve that field - theory problem .    to understand our method </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : decay ] shows the corresponding processes for weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> each creates a localized , high - energy , high - momentum excitation in the plasma , moving towards the right of the figure ( the @xmath26 direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will loosely call such an excitation a `` jet . '' in weakly - coupled qcd , the jet produced in fig.[fig : decay ] starts out as a nearly - collinear @xmath27 pair . in strongly - coupled @xmath18 sym , </S>",
    "<S> the analogy is a localized excitation of strongly interacting gluons , gluinos , and adjoint scalars .    </S>",
    "<S> now treat the red photon or @xmath28 line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : decay ] as an external field in the form of a high - energy plane wave @xmath29 with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will also approximately localize that external field , so that we know where the jet it creates starts from . </S>",
    "<S> that way , when we later see where the jet stops and thermalizes , we will be able to extract the stopping distance from the difference . </S>",
    "<S> put all together , we replace the photon or @xmath28 by adding a source term to the lagrangian : @xmath31 with @xmath32 the factor @xmath33 is the external field , where @xmath34 is a smooth envelope function which localizes the source to a region of size @xmath35 around the origin in both space and time . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 is the field - theory operator the external field couples to , such as @xmath37 in the examples of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it turns out that the response to such a source is measured by a _ </S>",
    "<S> 3-point correlator _ in the field theory . </S>",
    "<S> a crude but simple way to understand this is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3point ] . </S>",
    "<S> the boot represents the source operator in ( [ eq : source ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this operator to a generic state of the thermal plasma to create our localized , high - energy `` jet '' state , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3point]a . </S>",
    "<S> we then want the expectation value in this state of some conserved density  energy or momentum or charge  represented by the eyeball operator in fig .   [ fig:3point]b . substituting fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3point]a into the left - hand side of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3point]b yields the right - hand side of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3point]b , which is a 3-point correlator of the boot , the eyeball , and the boot - conjugate , calculated for an equilibrium plasma . for _ finite - temperature _ ads / cft calculations </S>",
    "<S> , there is a great deal in the literature on computing 2-point correlators , but until recently almost nothing carried through to specific results for 3-point correlators .     schematic picture of how the expectation of an observable ( eyeball ) in a jet state created by some operator ( boot ) can be related to a 3-point equilibrium correlator . </S>",
    "<S> ]    to compute this field - theory three - point correlator , we use gauge - gravity duality to relate it to a three - point boundary correlator in ads@xmath38-schwarzschild space , as depicted in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ads3point ] . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is the space - time point where we make our observation , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are integrated over the source region . </S>",
    "<S> recall that gauge - gravity duality relates the strongly - coupled field theory problem to a problem in _ classical _ gravity , which means tree diagrams in the gravity problem . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ads3point ] , we therefore have a three - leaf tree diagram made up of the dashed lines meeting at a vertex in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex represents a cubic term in the 5-dimensional supergravity action . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are bulk - to - boundary propagators and in our calculation are given by _ </S>",
    "<S> _ functions . </S>",
    "<S> heun functions are obscure generalizations of hypergeometric functions which are difficult to work with . as a result , it is difficult to make analytic progress in calculating generic 3-point functions , which requires integrating over the vertex position . it is also difficult to evaluate such integrals numerically in our problem because the fact that our source is high energy , and the fact that we are looking at real - time correlations , means that the bulk - to - boundary propagators associated with the boots are very highly oscillatory functions and so very difficult to integrate </S>",
    "<S> .    fortunately , this very problem also points the way to a solution . </S>",
    "<S> the ( red ) dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ads3point ] associated with the boots are high - energy / momentum propagators , and we may make a corresponding high-@xmath42 wkb - like approximation , which gives them a relatively simple analytic form . for the remaining ( green ) dashed line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ads3point ] , recall that the technique for measuring the stopping distance is to look for the spatial center of late - time charge diffusion , as depicted by the last curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kick ] . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to measurements of large wavelengths and so small wave numbers of the late - time response of the system . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we may use a low-@xmath42 approximation to the ( green ) dashed line associated with the eyeball in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ads3point ] . </S>",
    "<S> the low-@xmath42 limit also gives a relatively simple analytic expression for the propagator . </S>",
    "<S> these approximations , appropriate for the problem we want to solve , turn out to be enough to make it possible to analytically integrate over the bulk vertex position and compute the 3-point correlator . </S>",
    "<S> [ by the way , it is easy to see now why this physics could not possibly be captured by a 2-point correlator . </S>",
    "<S> if we took a 2-point correlator of a boot ( source ) and an eyeball ( measurement ) , there would be a mismatch between the high - momentum of the boot and the low wave - numbers of interest for the eyeball , and so the 2-point correlator would vanish by momentum conservation . ]     </S>",
    "<S> 3-leaf tree diagram that gives the 3-point correlator in the gravity dual theory . ]    the results @xcite of using this method to calculate the jet stopping distance are summarized in fig.[fig : result ] , which shows a probability distribution for the jet stopping distance . </S>",
    "<S> there is indeed a `` maximum '' stopping distance that scales like @xmath0 , beyond which the probability distribution falls off exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not the _ typical _ stopping distance of the jets created . </S>",
    "<S> almost all of the jets created by our kick ( [ eq : source ] ) instead stop sooner at a distance scale proportional to @xmath43 , where @xmath35 is the size of the space - time region in which the jet was initially created ( i.e. the size of the toe of our boot and the duration of the kick ) . is often instead used to stand for the thickness of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> this has nothing to do with our @xmath35 here : in our problem , we are considering jet stopping in an infinite medium . ] between the scales @xmath43 and @xmath0 , the probability distribution falls algebraically , with the power law depending on the conformal dimension of the source operator @xcite .     qualitative picture of the probability distribution of jet stopping distances , where @xmath35 is the source size . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law fall - off @xmath44 shown for the intermediate region is for the specific source operator analyzed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; the more general case is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ]    by the way , for the @xmath45 case , which dominates the probability distribution shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : result ] , the calculation can be made even simpler than the forgoing discussion . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out that one can use the approximation of geometric optics and replace the 3-point calculation of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ads3point ] by a simple classical calculation of a 5-dimensional particle falling toward the horizon in ads@xmath38-schwarzschild space . </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details .    </S>",
    "<S> readers may wonder what the size @xmath35 of the source has to do with how far jets propagate ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is that @xmath35 determines the virtuality of the source . </S>",
    "<S> recall that in ( [ eq : source ] ) we chose a source proportional to @xmath33 with @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the envelope function @xmath34 localized the source to a region of size @xmath35 and so , by the uncertainty principle , introduces a spread in momentum of size @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : momentum ] gives a qualitative picture of the region of momentum space that contributes to @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> generic momenta in this region are not exactly on the light cone , and we demonstrate in ref .  @xcite that the @xmath43 scaling of the typical stopping distance really means @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the typical virtuality of the source : @xmath50     qualitative picture of the region in 4-momentum where the source ( [ eq : source ] ) has support . ]    </S>",
    "<S> studying jet stopping in the strongly - coupled limit is a useful theoretical exercise in order to sharpen our understanding of the role that coupling @xmath2 plays in the scaling of jet stopping with energy . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides an interesting test case for optimists , or a straw man for cynics , for phenomenological comparisons with data : regardless of one s point of view , ads / cft results inspire the question of whether experiment can differentiate between @xmath51 and @xmath0 or other scaling for jet stopping distances , or between non - standard scaling laws for other measurements related to energy loss . for some work along these lines , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> readers who toy with such questions might naturally ask what happens if we now put @xmath52 into ( [ eq : stop ] ) , since @xmath52 is the virtuality scale of processes creating high - energy jets at mid - rapidity in actual relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>",

    "<S> if there is any phenomenological application for the results presented here , one should likely avoid treating the system as strongly coupled until enough time has passed that the initial virtuality @xmath52 associated with jet creation has dropped to some lower virtuality where one is willing to at least entertain the possibility that the @xmath2 associated with the emission of a bremsstrahlung gluon might be effectively strongly coupled .    </S>",
