    "the hadronic annihilation cross sections for electroweak boson production ( @xmath4 , w , z , h ) provide important test cases for resummation techniques in qcd .",
    "this paper describes the application of a simultaneous , joint resummation of threshold and transverse momentum singularities in these cross sections .",
    "the application to this well - studied case enables us to compare joint resummation to the data for z production at the tevatron .",
    "we regard it as a first step toward extending joint resummation to a wider range in kinematics and reactions , and toward a unified description of nonperturbative contributions in hadronic reactions .    at measured transverse momentum @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the pair or boson mass , annihilation cross sections have contributions @xmath7 at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "although highly singular at @xmath8 , these terms nevertheless organize themselves into a function that describes the sudakov suppression of the cross section at small @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "these singular corrections reflect the lack of phase space for soft radiation when the partons have just enough energy to produce the observed final state . like singularities at @xmath8 , they can be resummed to all orders @xcite .    unlike transverse momentum resummation , the singular functions of threshold resummation do not appear as explicit logarithms in the physical cross section , eq .",
    "( [ inclusive ] ) , since they are in convolution with the parton distribution functions . in practice ,",
    "transverse momentum resummation is usually of greater numerical significance at measured @xmath0 than is threshold resummation at integrated @xmath0 , simply because the typical value of @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ inclusive ] ) is generally far from unity . in such cases",
    ", threshold resummation shows that the effects of distributions singular at @xmath9 are under control .",
    "it also leads to cross sections that are in general less sensitive to the factorization scale @xcite .",
    "for this reason , and because the dynamical origins of the large corrections in both threshold and transverse momentum resummations are in soft gluon emission , it is attractive to develop a formalism that encompasses both .",
    "the necessary analysis for this combination , which we refer to as joint resummation , has been carried out in @xcite for parton distributions , and in @xcite for electroweak annihilation as well as qcd cross sections .",
    "the effects of resummation are closely bound to momentum conservation .",
    "the singular corrections associated with soft gluon emission exponentiate in the corresponding spaces of moments , impact parameter for transverse momentum , and mellin ( or laplace ) moments in energy for threshold resummation .",
    "the transforms relax momentum and energy conservation , while their inverses reimpose it . in joint resummation ,",

    "@xcite , a preliminary analysis of prompt photon production was carried out from the point of view of joint resummation , with an emphasis on the role of recoil in higher - order terms in the relevant hard scattering functions .",
    "relatively substantial effects were found in that case . in this context , it is important to return to the better - understood example of electroweak annihilation to test the joint formalism .    as mentioned above",
    ", there is a close relation between resummation and nonperturbative corrections .",
    "taking into account nonleading logarithms and the running of the coupling , resummation leads in each case to a perturbative expression in which the scale of the coupling reflects the value of the transform variable . because of the singularity of the perturbative effective coupling at @xmath19 , the resulting expressions are , strictly speaking , undefined .",
    "a closer look , however , shows that singular contributions appear only at nonleading powers of momentum transfer .",
    "this is an example of how perturbative resummation can suggest the way nonperturbative dynamics is expressed in infrared safe hard scattering functions . in effect ,",
    "perturbation theory is ambiguous , and the resolution of its ambiguities is , by definition , nonperturbative @xcite .",
    "as we shall review below , these ambiguities manifest themselves as singularities in the integrand of the inverse transforms for both transverse momentum and threshold resummations . each scheme for dealing with these singularities",
    "constitutes a specification of perturbation theory , and implies a parameterization of nonperturbative effects .",
    "we hope that a joint resummation affords a more general approach to this problem .    for each resummed cross section ,",
    "be it @xmath0 , threshold or joint , one must first specify how to define perturbation theory in the transform space , and then , given a well - defined expression , how to invert the transform .",
    "the most  conservative \" approach is to expand the resummed expression to some fixed order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "since the resummation contains information on singular terms at all orders , we may in this way get information beyond the order at which a complete calculation has been done . to fixed order ,",
    "the perturbative expression and its transform are unambiguous .",
    "this approach is applicable to threshold resummation for inclusive cross sections , but is not directly useful for phenomenology at measured @xmath20 , where the cross section is singular .",
    "another approach for @xmath0 resummation is to use the exponentiation of leading logarithms in transverse momentum space , and incorporate the finite order improvements , including those due to the running coupling and momentum conservation , by a direct expansion @xcite .",
    "a similar application for threshold resummation was developed in @xcite .",
    "finally , in both @xmath0 and threshold resummation , we may , as indicated above , redefine the resummed perturbation theory in transform space , and invert the resulting transform numerically . for threshold resummation this has been done by so - called principal - value @xcite and minimal @xcite prescriptions for perturbation theory . both exploit the analytic structure of the running coupling , and redefine transform integrals to avoid the landau pole . for @xmath0 resummation",
    ", the commonly - used approach ( the @xmath21-prescription ) @xcite introduces an infrared scale , beyond which the running of the coupling is decoupled from the transform variable .",
    "more recently , qiu and zhang @xcite have proposed another method , employing a smooth extrapolation of the perturbative resummed cross section in impact parameter space to push the landau singularity to infinity .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the jointly resummed cross section derived in @xcite , defined by a next - to - leading logarithm approximation to the resummed exponent , and an analytic continuation of the @xmath22-space contour following @xcite .",
    "we stress that we could have made other choices , like those mentioned above , within the context of joint resummation .",
    "we find the approach of @xcite , reviewed below , attractive for its simplicity .",
    "it results in a redefined perturbative series with no new dimensional scale beyond @xmath19 .",
    "phenomenological parameters then appear only as nonperturbative power corrections . in this",
    " test case \" for joint resummation , we shall find a consistency with the data from z production that we believe is comparable to that of other approaches .",
    "we hope that this will serve as a starting - point for further development .",
    "we note that different treatments of the perturbative exponent may differ markedly in pure threshold resummation , due to different treatments of nonleading logarithms  @xcite .",
    "this important question applies to joint resummation as well , but we shall not explore these differences in this paper .",
    "this is because the vector boson cross sections discussed here are in the kinematic region described above , where @xmath18 is far from unity in eq .",
    "( [ inclusive ] ) , and where we expect the effect of pure threshold resummation to be small in any scheme .",
    "we begin our technical discussion with a review of the joint resummation formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , applied to z production , including a comparison to the exact @xmath23 cross section .",
    "we develop the phenomenological evaluation of the resulting expressions in sec .",
    "this includes the specification of resummed perturbation theory through contour integrals in the two transform spaces , the matching to finite order calculations , and the parameterization of nonperturbative effects . in sec .  4 , we compare the resulting expressions to cdf and d0 data , fitting the necessary nonperturbative parameter . following this",
    ", we give a few preliminary conclusions on the status and prospects of the joint resummation program . in appendix",
    "a , we present some well - known formulas that are relevant for our calculation , and in appendix b , we sketch the simple numerical method that enables us to evaluate resummed moment space integrals for parton distribution functions that are specified only in @xmath24-space .",

    "resummation of soft - gluon effects is achieved through the flavor - diagonal sudakov exponent @xmath29 , while the `` @xmath30-coefficients '' contain the parton distribution functions and provide resummation of additional logarithms of soft - collinear and collinear origin .",

    "@xcite , the somewhat simpler choice [ chiold ] ( ) =    less convenient for phenomenological studies .",

    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf ] , the cross section at @xmath215 , @xmath217 , is larger than @xmath218 . as expected , the difference @xmath219 is _ smaller _ than @xmath216 , so that the full cross section in eq .",
    "( [ joint : match ] ) depends only little on whether matching is performed at @xmath62 or at @xmath215 .",
    "we take this feature as an indication that our approach for matching , eq .",
    "( [ joint : match ] ) , is justified and reasonable even at large @xmath220 .    to improve the low-@xmath0 behavior further , we introduce a nonperturbative function as described in eq .",
    "( [ replace ] ) .",
    "since most of the cross section comes from the region @xmath221 , we neglect the mild ( logarithmic ) dependence of the parameter @xmath203 on @xmath6 .",
    "we then fit @xmath203 to the cdf and d0 data simultaneously , allowing again the normalizations to vary for the two data sets .",
    "since @xmath203 should be determined from the low-@xmath0 region , we include only the data points with @xmath222 gev in this fit .",
    "the results of the fit do , however , not depend much on this choice .",
    "the optimal result is obtained for @xmath223 gev@xmath224 and the normalization factors 1.069 ( 0.975 ) for cdf ( d0 ) .",
    "the @xmath214 for the 42 ( 20 ) data points from cdf ( d0 ) included in the fit is 31.3 ( 23.4 ) .",

    "[ fig : cdf ] and  [ fig : d0 ] , with these parameters a very good agreement between the jointly resummed cross section , matched with the fixed - order cross section at @xmath225 , and the data is achieved .",
    "we note that our nonperturbative parameter @xmath223 gev@xmath224 is very similar to that determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an extrapolation of the perturbation theory result to large @xmath22 was made .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath22 integral in pure-@xmath0 resummation is dominated by the saddle point .",
    "our method and theirs lead to somewhat smaller values of the nonperturbative parameter than when a @xmath21 prescription is used  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of the z is by now a well - studied problem , to which a number of successful analyses have been applied @xcite .",
    "we have come back to this topic because we believe that the method of joint resummation offers additional insight on the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative corrections in this , and other hadronic reactions .",
    "joint resummation , implemented as above , provides a convenient definition of the perturbative cross section at any nonzero @xmath0 , without the introduction of additional dimensional scales ( beyond @xmath19 ) to define either the perturbative resummation or the parton distributions at low scales .",
    "treated this way , the jointly resummed cross section retains its original perturbative asymptotic expansion order by order .",
    "it also suggests the functional form of nonperturbative corrections .",
    "because perturbative and nonperturbative components of a qcd cross section are linked at the level of power corrections @xcite , it will be necessary , and useful , to reanalyze the functional and phenomenological aspects of nonperturbative corrections in this formalism , relying on the available range of data for the drell - yan mechanism . toward the high - energy side , a further application to higgs production @xcite at the lhc",
    "will also be of interest .",
