    "a koszul duality for strict polynomial functors has been introduced in recent work of chaupnik @xcite and touz @xcite . in this note",
    "we give a detailed report .",
    "our aim is :    * to make explicit the underlying monoidal structure for the category of strict polynomial functors , * to explain the connection with ringel duality for schur algebras , * to describe serre duality for strict polynomial functors in terms of koszul duality , and * to remove assumptions on the ring of coefficients .",
    "the category of strict polynomial functors was introduced by friedlander and suslin @xcite in their work on the cohomology of finite group schemes .",
    "we use an equivalent description in terms of representations of divided powers , following expositions of kuhn @xcite , pirashvili @xcite , and bousfield @xcite .",
    "the construction of the koszul duality can be summarised as follows .",

    "the category @xmath2 has a tensor product @xmath3 which is induced by the tensor product for the category of divided powers .",
    "2 .   the left derived tensor functor given by the exterior power @xmath4 of degree @xmath1 induces for the derived category of @xmath2 an equivalence @xmath5    the crucial observation for proving the second part of this theorem is that classical koszul duality provides resolutions of the exterior power @xmath4 and the symmetric power @xmath6 which give an isomorphism @xmath7    strict polynomial functors are closely related to modules over schur algebras .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 is equivalent to the category of modules over the schur algebra @xmath8 for @xmath9 , by a result of friedlander and suslin @xcite .",
    "schur algebras were introduced by green @xcite and provide a link between representations of the general linear groups and the symmetric groups .",

    "a koszul type duality for modules over schur algebras seems to appear first in work of akin and buchsbaum @xcite .",
    "for instance , they construct resolutions of schur and weyl modules , and it is koszul duality which maps one to the other ; see proposition  [ pr : schur ] .",
    "a few years later , ringel @xcite introduced characteristic tilting modules for quasi - hereditary algebras .",
    "these tilting modules give rise to derived equivalences , relating a quasi - hereditary algebra and its ringel dual .",
    "donkin @xcite described those tilting modules for schur algebras , and it turns out that koszul duality as introduced by chaupnik @xcite and touz @xcite is equivalent to ringel duality for modules over schur algebras ; this is the content of theorem  [ th : ringel ] .",
    "the koszul duality @xmath10 is an endofunctor and it would be interesting to have a description of its powers .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that its square is a serre duality functor in the sense of @xcite ; this is another consequence of the isomorphism and the content of corollary  [ co : serre ] .",
    "my interest in the subject of these notes originates from lectures of greg stevenson ( at a summer school in bad driburg in august 2011 ) and of antoine touz ( at a conference in strasbourg in november 2011 ) .",
