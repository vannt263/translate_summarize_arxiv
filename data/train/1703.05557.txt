    "in this paper , we investigate the hausdorff  young inequality for a nonlinear version of the fourier transform , and establish theorem [ thm : main ] below . before stating it",
    "precisely , we briefly discuss the linear case . given a complex - valued integrable function @xmath1 on the real line , we normalize its fourier transform as follows : @xmath2 in this way , the fourier transform is a contraction from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and it extends to a unitary operator on @xmath5 .",
    "standard interpolation tools can then be used to show that , for any @xmath6 $ ] , the fourier transform is also a contraction from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the exponent conjugate to @xmath10 .",
    "this is the content of the classical hausdorff  young inequality .",
    "its sharp version was first established by babenko @xcite in the case when the exponent @xmath11 is an even integer , and then by beckner @xcite for general exponents .",
    "it states that , if @xmath6 $ ] , then @xmath12 for every @xmath13 , where the optimal constant is given by @xmath14 an easy computation shows that gaussians , i.e. functions of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , turn inequality into an equality . in other words , gaussians are _ extremizers _ for inequality .",
    "in the converse direction , lieb @xcite has shown that all extremizers for inequality are in fact gaussians . recently , christ @xcite further refined inequality by establishing the following sharpened version : given @xmath18 , there exists a constant @xmath19 such that , for every nonzero function @xmath13 , @xmath20 here , the distance from @xmath13 to the set of all gaussians , denoted @xmath21 , is naturally defined as @xmath22    we now describe the nonlinear setting of the present paper .",
    "we are interested in the simplest nonlinear model of the fourier transform , also known as the _ dirac scattering transform _ or the _",
    "@xmath23-scattering transform_. to describe it precisely , take a measurable , bounded , and compactly supported function @xmath24 , which will often be referred to as a _",

    "sources of motivation for considering this precise instance of the nonlinear fourier transform include the eigenvalue problem for the dirac operator , the study of completely integrable systems and scattering theory , and the riemann  hilbert problem ; see the expository paper @xcite for further information , and the notes @xcite for several related examples in the discrete setting .",

    "the nonlinear riemann  lebesgue estimate , which follows easily from grnwall s inequality , states that @xmath61 for every potential @xmath1 .",
    "the nonlinear plancherel identity , which is a well - known scattering identity that can be established via complex contour integration ( see e.g. the appendix in @xcite ) , states that @xmath62 for every potential @xmath1 as before .",

    "@xmath64 is a well - known open problem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "even if interpolation is not available in the present nonlinear setting , the work of christ and kiselev on the spectral theory of one - dimensional schrdinger operators @xcite , @xcite establishes a version of the nonlinear hausdorff  young inequality which translates into the present context as follows : if @xmath6 $ ] , then there exists a constant @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 for every potential @xmath1 .",
    "an interesting question raised in @xcite is whether the constants @xmath67 can be chosen uniformly in @xmath10 , as @xmath68 .",
    "this has been confirmed in a particular toy model in @xcite , but remains an open problem in its full generality . by considering truncated gaussian potentials @xmath69}(x)\\ ] ] as @xmath70 and linearizing",
    ", one can check that the constant in is at least as large as beckner s constant , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "one may be tempted to conjecture that the optimal constant in is actually @xmath72 .",
    "while these questions are left open by the present work , we are able to provide some further supporting evidence of their validity by considering the behaviour of the nonlinear hausdorff  young ratio for sufficiently small potentials .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath18 , @xmath9 , and @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 .",
    "then there exist @xmath75 and @xmath76 , depending on @xmath77 , with the following property : if @xmath78 is an interval of length @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is a measurable function such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 , then @xmath83    a few remarks may help to further orient the reader .    * the parameters @xmath84 provide upper bounds for the _ height _ and the _ width _ of the function @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "they are fixed but can be arbitrarily large .",
    "* inequality implies with an optimal constant @xmath72 , but only within the restricted class of potentials considered in the theorem , and this class is allowed to depend on @xmath10 . that way theorem  [ thm : main ] does not claim uniform boundedness of the constants in for any particular family of functions .",
    "it rather fixes the value of @xmath10 and shows that the nonlinear hausdorff  young inequality beats the linear one in the asymptotic regime when @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , the constant @xmath86 is never attained for nonzero potentials in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the zero function ( depending on @xmath87 ) . * between the lines of the first part of the proof below ( see  [ sec : far ] ) , one can easily obtain @xmath88 estimate provides a cheap version of , with @xmath89 replaced by @xmath90 , as @xmath91 , but the interest lies , of course , in obtaining the estimate with a negative sign . however , at least shows that the mere uniformity of the constants @xmath67 is trivial for potentials that are controlled in the @xmath0 norm .",
    "* it is easy to observe that is invariant under @xmath0-normalized dilations applied to @xmath1 .",
    "that way one can trade width for height or vice versa , and conclude that @xmath92 depend only on the _ product _ @xmath93 .",
    "this fact can also be checked by tracking the dependence of various parameters in the proof .",
    "let us briefly comment on the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , which spans over the next three sections .",
    "the upshot is that for most choices of @xmath1 one can simply estimate the error arising from linearization , while for the remaining ones we verify that the nonlinear effect actually improves the estimate . to implement this strategy",
    ", we set up a case distinction , depending on whether the function @xmath1 is far or close to the set of gaussians , in an appropriate sense .",
    "the former case is the subject of  [ sec : far ] , where we invoke christ s sharpened hausdorff  young inequality in order to absorb the error terms coming from linearization .",
    "the latter case is the subject of  [ sec : close ] , where we use a perturbative argument to expand the functional in question around a suitable gaussian that provides a good approximation for @xmath1 in _ both _ the @xmath94 and the @xmath0 senses .",
    "we are naturally led to study a certain quartic operator @xmath95 and its quadrilinear variant @xmath96 , which enjoy various symmetries .",
    "the operator @xmath95 can in turn be pointwise dominated by a power of the maximally truncated fourier transform , defined as follows : @xmath97 where the supremum is taken over all intervals @xmath98 .",
    "the classical menshov  paley ",
    "zygmund inequality states that , for every @xmath18 , there exists @xmath99 such that , for every @xmath13 , @xmath100 the argument makes crucial use of estimate in order to control the error terms , and to verify that the second order variation about the aforementioned gaussian has the correct sign .",
    "proofs of several technical lemmata are deferred to ",
    "[ sec : proofs ] .",
    "finally , in the last section  [ sec : counterexample ] , we provide a counterexample to the natural question of whether an inequality @xmath101 might hold for a general bounded compactly supported potential @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath102 , we exhibit an explicit linear combination of indicator functions of six contiguous intervals of unit length that disproves .",
    "because of this , we believe that theorem  [ thm : main ] can not be established solely by regarding as a small perturbation of .    * notation . *",
    "if @xmath103 are real numbers , we write @xmath104 or @xmath105 if there exists a finite absolute constant @xmath106 such that @xmath107 . if we want to make explicit the dependence of the constant @xmath106 on some parameter @xmath108 , we write @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
