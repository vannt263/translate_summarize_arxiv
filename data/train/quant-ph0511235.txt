    "this is suspect since it is known that fde s are fundamentally different from ode s , and that solutions of fde s can have qualitative features impossible for solutions of ode s .",
    "the physical consequences of these differences are explained at length in the author s previous book.@xmath35 two differences of immediate concern are the following .",
    "\\(a ) given a system of ode s of the form    @xmath36    a unique solution can be obtained by prescribing the initial values of @xmath37 at a single point of time , say @xmath38 . however , given a system of fde s of the form    @xmath39    and assuming these fde s to be retarded ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) , this is no longer true .",
    "for example , consider the fde    @xmath41    clearly , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are solutions , and since the equation is linear , any linear combination @xmath44 is also a solution of ( [ cos ] ) , for arbitrary constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the values of both @xmath45 and @xmath46 obviously can not be fixed from a knowledge of a single quantity @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , from the mathematical theory of fdes,@xmath48 it is known that prescribing the initial values of even an infinite number of derivatives , @xmath49 is not adequate . to obtain a unique solution of the retarded fde ( [ fde ] ) we are required to prescribe the values of @xmath50 over an entire interval @xmath51 $ ] , in the form of an _ initial function _",
    "@xmath52 . that is , to solve retarded fde s one needs to prescribe _ past _ data rather than instantaneous or ` initial'(or final ) data .",
    "( b )  since the speed of light is so large , in many actual contexts , the delay @xmath23 is likely to be extremely small ( @xmath53s , for the classical hydrogen atom ) . under these circumstances , it is tempting to approximate a fde of the form ( [ fde ] ) by an ode of the form ( [ ode ] ) by arguing that if the delay @xmath23 is small , then the values of @xmath54 can be approximately obtained from the values of @xmath47 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , by means of a ` taylor ' expansion .",
    "such a procedure , however , is known to be erroneous because of fundamental _ qualitative _ differences between solutions of fde s and ode s . for example , unlike an ode , which can be solved either forward or backward in time , a retarded fde can not generally be solved backward in time . fig",
    "1 reproduced from ref .",
    "1 depicts ` phase collapse'three forward solutions of an fde merge into one solution , so that a unique backward solution is impossible from data prescribed on the interval [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "intersecting trajectories in phase space is a phenomenon impossible with ode s , so that the basic classical mechanics requirement of a phase flow breaks down.@xmath57 [ the origin of this time - asymmetry is retrospectively obvious on physical grounds , since the force ( [ em - force ] ) has destroyed the underlying time symmetry of electrodynamics , by assuming retardation . ]",
    "[ 1.2 ] [ width = 18pc ] retarded    thus , on grounds of the known mathematical differences between fde s and ode s , it is reasonable to doubt , a priori , that the full electrodynamic force ( [ em - force ] ) can be validly approximated by the coulomb force , by neglecting the vector potential .    a good way to settle this",
    "doubt is to put the matter to test by comparing the coulomb - force solution with the solutions obtained using the full electrodynamic force .",
    "this requires a solution of the 2-body problem with the full electrodynamic force , and we accordingly proceed to calculate such a solution .",
    "the mathematical features of fde s briefly recapitulated above suggest that retarded electrodynamics involves a ` paradigm shift ' from ` classical mechanics ' , for we now need past data rather than instantaneous data . in a debate on this question at groningen ,",
    "h. d. zeh argued against any such paradigm shift .",
    "zeh maintained that there was no need for past data , since data prescribed on a spacelike hypersurface ( corresponding to an instant in spacetime ) was adequate to solve the system of maxwell s partial differential equations ( pde s ) together with the heaviside - lorentz equations of motion for each particle .",
    "given all fields on a spacelike hypersurface , one can evolve them forward in time for a small region .",
    "_ given all fields _ , in the vicinity of a single particle , its equations of motion reduce to a system of ode s which can be solved in the usual way",
    ". we will call this method  1 .",
    "we note that it implicitly involves the simultaneous solution of a _ coupled _ system of pde s and ode s .",
    "in contrast to method  1 , the fde formulation of the electrodynamic 2-body problem may be geometrically visualised as follows.@xmath58 assuming retarded potentials , the force on particle  1 at a given spacetime point @xmath59 is evaluated as follows .",
    "one constructs the backward null cone with vertex at @xmath59 , and determines where it intersects the world - line of particle  2 , at a point @xmath60 , say ( see fig .",
    "[ twobodyforce ] ) . given the world - line of the particle 2 in a neighborhood of @xmath61 one",
    "evaluates the resulting lienard - wiechert potential at @xmath59 , and uses this retarded potential to calculate the force on particle  1 at @xmath59 .",
    "this is the force given by ( [ em - force ] ) .",
    "the force on particle  2 at any point is calculated similarly .",
    "clearly , we can solve for the motion of either particle , only if we are given the appropriate portions of the _ past _ world line of the other particle . we will call this method  2 .",
    "the groningen debate brought out the following difficulty .",
    "_ both _ the above methods seem to have the _ same _ underlying physical principles ( newton s laws of motion , possibly in a generalised form suitable for special relativity + maxwell s equations ) .",
    "how , then , can these principles admit fundamentally incompatible interpretations of instantaneity and history - dependence ?    [ width = 12pc ] electr2      this issue can be readily resolved as follows .",
    "if retarded propagators ( i.e. , green functions , or fundamental solutions of the wave equation , or retarded lienard - wiechert potentials ) are assumed , then the field at any point @xmath62 relates to particle movements in the past at the points @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the respective world lines of particles @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where the backward null cone from @xmath62 respectively meets the world lines of the two particles(fig .",
    "[ relating1and2 ] ) .",
    "thus , to know the field at a point _",
    "x _ we should know the particle world lines at and around the _ past _ points @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "if we do this for every point @xmath62 on a spacelike hypersurface , the points @xmath63 , and @xmath64 will , in general , cover the entire past world lines of the two particles .",
    "thus , in the 2-body context , given the assumption of retardation , prescribing the fields on a spacelike hypersurface is really equivalent to prescribing the _ entire _ past histories of the two particles .",
    "that is ,    @xmath65    [ width = 14pc]electr1    that is , the pde+ode method 1 only _ hides _ the underlying history - dependence of electrodynamics .",
    "( the above remarks need to be appropriately modified if , instead of assuming retardation , one assumes advanced or mixed - type propagators . for example , if we use advanced propagators , then ` anticipation ' should be used in place of ` history - dependence ' , etc . )      while _ both _ methods require past data on the motion of the two particles , the intuitive schema underlying method  1 is currently inconvenient for the actual process of obtaining a solution .",
    "formally speaking , there is no well - known existence and uniqueness theorem for a _ coupled _ system of pdes+ode s .",
    "[ separate existence theorems are , of course , known for pde s ( maxwell s equations , in this case ) , and for ode s ( to which the particle equations of motion reduce , _ if _ all fields are given ) . ]",
    "neither is there any well known numerical algorithm which converts the intuitive method of iteratively solving coupled pde s + ode s into an actual process of calculation.@xmath66 both formal proof and a numerical scheme can very likely be developed without much difficulty .",
    "however , neither is available as of now , so method  1 can not , as of now , be used to obtain a solution of the full - force electrodynamic 2-body problem .",
    "in contrast , for fde s there already is a formal existence and uniqueness theorem from past data.@xmath67 further , there are well known numerical algorithms and tested computer programs available@xmath68 ( though they do not  have all of the most desirable numerical characteristics , and the current code has not been formally proved to be error free ) .",
    "accordingly , method  2 is currently the method of choice .",
    "incidentally , the pde+ode method  1 seems to need data on the _ entire _ past trajectories of the two particles .",
    "this is _ more _ information than is usually required for the fde method  2 . [ because of the numerical stiffness of the underlying equations , in practice , one is able to numerically solve the classical hydrogen atom with method  2 for only short time periods , of the order of a femto second ( @xmath69  s ) , for which only a very short portion of the past history is needed .",
    "] that is , method  1 , despite its appearance of preserving instantaneity and not needing any information from the past , actually seems to need _ more _ information about the past than method  2 ! a very careful analysis of the method would presumably show that the solution by method  1 actually uses information from only that part of the cauchy hypersurface within the cauchy horizon , so that information across the entire hypersurface is not needed , and the two methods are really equivalent . at present , however , that is still a conjecture .",
    "_ how _ should the past history of the two particles be prescribed ?",
    "existing physics provides no guidelines to help answer this question : exactly like fields on a spacelike hypersurface in method  1 , it permits us to prescribe the past particle motions more or less arbitrarily .",
    "this has two consequences worth noting .",
    "thus , ( 1 )  mathematically , the past data for a fde is _ not _ required to be a solution of the fde , and ( 2 )  the mathematical theory of fde s tells us that a discontinuity may well develop at the initial point where the prescribed past data joins with the solution of the fde .    from a physical point of view , this past motion may be regarded as a bound or constrained motion  constrained , perhaps , by additional mechanical forces  and the discontinuity at the initial point may be attributed to the sudden removal of the additional constraint at @xmath70 .",
    "these discontinuities propagate downstream . while it is known from the general theory@xmath71 that the discontinuities of a retarded fde are typically smoothened out over time , i.e. , that they move over to successively higher derivatives , we must recognize that the problem we are solving is ( except in 1  dimension ) technically a neutral@xmath72 fde ( even though only retarded lienard - wiechert potentials are being used ) , so that no such smoothing need take place , and the discontinuities may persist .",
    "the discontinuity creates a mathematical difficulty : for , in classical electrodynamics , the equations of motion are formulated assuming that the particle trajectories are at least thrice continuously differentiable ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the numerical solution of the fde by higher - order runge - kutta methods also assumes a similarly high level of smoothness , which assumption is not justified if the past history is prescribed arbitrarily .",
    "this problem of discontinuities obviously is a suitable topic for further research , and in the sequel we shall set it aside and rely on the methods for handling discontinuities that are already incorporated into existing computer codes like retard and archi@xmath74 , which handle discontinuities for example by switching to low - order polynomial extrapolation or predictor - corrector methods near a discontinuity .",
    "both these programs are so written that they permit a discontinuity even in the function ( positions , velocities ) at the initial point , though we can always arrange initial conditions so that there is a discontinuity at most in the derivative ( acceleration ) at the initial point .",
    "we will prescribe past and initial data in such a way that discontinuities are confined to the acceleration and higher derivatives  though , like ` quantum jumps ' , it is not at present clear whether these are the only sorts of discontinuities that are ` physically acceptable ' .",
    "the archi program enables the tracking of such discontinuities , classified as ` hard ' or ` soft ' according to the theory of will and baker.@xmath75 hard discontinuities are those that propagate instantaneously between components , while soft discontinuities are those that propagate over time . in the present context , since there are no advanced interactions , all discontinuities are soft , except for discontinuities between components ( velocity , acceleration ) representing derivatives .",
    "( further , the archi program has certain refinements  such as the use of a cyclic queue to store past history  that are not immediately relevant . )      to return to the physics , since our aim is to test how well the coulomb force approximates the full electrodynamic force , let us consider the case of the classical hydrogen atom , without radiative damping .",
    "suppose an electron and proton are for @xmath76 constrained to rotate rigidly in a classical circular 2-body orbit , calculated using the coulomb force .",
    "what will happen when this constraint is removed at @xmath70 ? with the past history prescribed in this way , we now have a complete problem that can be solved by method  2 .      that is",
    ", we take the non - relativistic equations of motion to be given by the heaviside - lorentz force law for each particle:@xmath77    @xmath78   . \\label",
    "{ eom}\\ ] ]    the radiative damping term given by square brackets in ( [ eom ] ) has been dropped , since it is not immediately relevant to our purpose of deciding whether the electrodynamic force ( [ em - force ] ) can be approximated by the coulomb force .",
    "( we know that , in the absence of radiation damping , with the coulomb force , the initial ` keplerian ' orbit should remain stable . )",
    "we also take the mass to be constant though , relativistically , only the proper mass is constant .",
    "this assumption , again , is appropriate to the comparison we wish to make between the coulomb force and the full electrodynamic force .",
    "a slight change of notation is helpful for the explicit calculation .",
    "we let    @xmath79    the mass ratio @xmath80 is dimensionless , while @xmath81 has dimensions of @xmath82 ( = length in units in which @xmath83 ) .",
    "denote the 3-dimensional trajectories of the two particles by @xmath84 .",
    "the delays @xmath85 , and the vectors @xmath86 are defined by the simultaneous equations    @xmath87    @xmath88    since here we consider only retarded solutions , for which @xmath89 we need to solve only the equations    @xmath90    @xmath91    to obtain @xmath92 as functions of @xmath19 , when suitable portions of the past trajectories @xmath93 are known .",
    "specifically , for each given @xmath19 , we compute @xmath94 and @xmath95 as the zeros of the functions @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . the labelling has been chosen to make the equations below symmetrical .",
    "we also introduce some notation to describe the velocity and acceleration at the retarded times :    @xmath98    @xmath99    for the vector @xmath100 used to simplify the appearance of ( [ em - force ] ) we now have the expressions    @xmath101    with these notations , the equations of motion take the explicit form :    @xmath102 , \\label { kappa}\\ ] ]    @xmath103 , \\label { mu}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath104 , \\ ] ]    @xmath105 . \\label { eomend}\\ ] ]    the slight asymmetry between the two equations ( [ kappa ] ) and ( [ mu ] ) is only apparent , but is helpful as follows . by convention",
    "we take the mass ratio @xmath106 , so the equation for the heavier particle is the one in which @xmath80 appears ( and to calculate @xmath81 we must use the mass of the lighter particle ) . for the purpose of computation we took @xmath80 as the mass ratio of the electron to the proton , and calculated @xmath81 accordingly .    from the numerical point of view , the inverse of the mass ratio is a measure of the numerical stiffness of the problem .",

    "these results establish that it is faulty to use a model based on the balance of instantaneous forces in a circular orbit , with the coulomb force as in the classical kepler problem .",

    "the full force acting on the electron has a tangential component along the direction of the electron velocity .",
    "accordingly , it has a torque about the centre of mass , which torque initially _ accelerates _ the electron . with the coulomb force ,",
    "such a tangential component of force , or a torque , is clearly impossible : since the coulomb force acts instantaneously , it always acts along the line through the instantaneous centre of mass .",
    "the time evolution of this torque is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ delaytorque ] . during the prescribed past history",
    ", this torque is a constant .",
    "subsequently , it oscillates , so that the fde solution oscillates about the ode solution , and the entirety of the fde orbit never strays very far from the entirety of the ode orbit .",
    "[ 2.0 ] [ width=12pc]tanforce",
    "given the fundamental differences between fde and ode , it would have been astonishing if the above calculations had _ not _ shown up a difference from classical expectations .",
    "however , the above results are based on a mathematical theory , which , despite its rigor , is not commonly known to physicists .",
    "further , the results of a complex numerical calculation might well involve some hidden error or subtle instability .",
    "accordingly , one gains greater confidence in the numerical results if there is a way to understand the results intuitively and heuristically .",
    "this is not easy , given that the physicist s intuition is trained around ode s , that are fundamentally different from the fde s used in the above calculation .",
    "however , we may proceed as follows .      for an intuitive understanding of the above result",
    ", we need to approximate the force ( [ em - force ] ) by a simpler force .",
    "any instantaneous approximation , such as the coulomb force , would be mathematically unsound .",
    "nothing we know , however , prevents us from approximating an fde by a simpler fde .",
    "that is , we may well approximate the full electrodynamic force by a simpler force _ while retaining the delay_.    accordingly , let us consider a force which varies inversely as the square of the _ retarded _ distance .",
    "the retarded distance is the distance from the current position of the electron to the ` last seen ' position of the proton ( fig .",
    "[ twobodyorbits ] ) .",
    "such a force is not physically acceptable , since it can not be relativistically covariant ; however , the simple expression for the force helps us to understand intuitively the consequences of a delay .",
    "[ width=12pc ] retinv      the key point here is not the exact magnitude of the force , but its _ direction _ :",
    "for this force acts along the line joining the current position of the electron to the _",
    "last seen _ position of the proton .",
    "we can now immediately see the effect of even a tiny delay .",
    "assume , to begin with , that the two particles are rotating rigidly in circular orbits about a common centre of mass .",
    "because of the retardation , howsoever tiny , the last seen position of the proton can never be the same as its instantaneous position .",
    "therefore , because of the retardation , howsoever tiny , the instantaneous force acting on the electron can _ not _ pass through the instantaneous centre of mass .",
    "the situation for the other charged particle is similar .",
    "these circumstances are anathema to classical mechanics , for it is a well known that , under such circumstances , angular momentum can not be conserved .",
    "thus , we have the astonishing situation that , _ purely under the action of internal forces , the system suffers a net torque_.    the last seen position of the proton always lags behind its instantaneous position .",
    "hence , for the situation of rigid rotation depicted in fig .  [ twobodyorbits ] , the force exerted by the proton on the electron has a positive component in the direction of the electron velocity .",
    "hence , the force tends to accelerate the electron .",
    "we can use the retarded inverse - square force approximation also to heuristically try to understand the oscillation of the computed delay torque .",
    "the initial delay torque first accelerates both particles .",
    "the last - seen position of the proton starts moving towards and eventually falls _ on _ the instantaneous normal line to the curve being traced by the electron , so that the delay torque ( about the instantaneous centre of rotation / curvature ) is zero .",
    "the last - seen position of the other particle ( proton ) then moves ` ahead ' of the instantaneous normal line to the curve traced by the electron , where ` ahead ' and ` behind ' is with respect to the direction in which the curve is being traced .",
    "the delay torque changes sign and starts decelerating the electron .",
    "if we neglect radiation damping , angular momentum is conserved on the average .",
    "this is similar to what the numerical computation with the full electrodynamic force showed .",
    "there is an old argument to the effect that the introduction of radiation damping makes the classical hydrogen atom unstable .",
    "this argument is based on the coulomb - force formulation of the electrodynamic 2-body problem . for the full electrodynamic force ,",
    "the effect of introducing radiation reaction is no longer obvious , because of the existence of a delay torque which initially _ accelerates _ the electron .",
    "there are three difficulties here .",
    "first the exact form of the radiation damping term is not quite clear .",
    "diracs@xmath148 argument that the 5th and higher - order terms are too complicated for ` a simple thing like the electron ' is an interesting argument , but not entirely convincing .",
    "secondly , this author has pointed out that dirac s derivation of radiation reaction approximates a fde by a ode using a ` taylor ' expansion in powers of the delay , and the mathematically suspect nature of this approximation is reinforced by the above calculation . finally , putting in 3rd order radiation reaction",
    "may be expected to result in a numerically ill - conditioned problem , and appropriate codes for this are yet to be developed .",
    "( the dopri 4 - 5 code used implicitly in retard is not appropriate for stiff ode s . )    since the issues involved are complex , it is helpful to have an initial estimate about the outcome of such a rigorous calculation . for the purposes of such an initial estimate , about the effect of radiation damping",
    ", we again use the simple heuristic case of the retarded inverse square force , to determine whether there can be a balance of forces between the delay torque and 3rd order radiation damping .    to this end , consider two particles interacting through the retarded inverse square force .",
    "the force on the electron exerted by the proton is given by    @xmath149    the force acts in the direction of the 3-vector @xmath150 , along which the proton is ` last seen ' by the electron .",
    "the 3-vector @xmath150 may be represented by    @xmath151    where @xmath152 , and @xmath153 denote respectively the instantaneous position vectors of the proton and electron , respectively , at time @xmath19 , and @xmath154 is the delay , so that @xmath155 is the ` last seen ' position of the proton .",
    "assuming that the two particles are in rigid rotation with constant angular velocity @xmath123 , and referring back to fig .",
    "[ twobodyorbits ] , we have , in 3-vector notation ,    @xmath156 , \\\\ - { \\bf r}_p   ( t -   \\delta t )   \\ :   & =   & \\ : r_2 [   \\cos   \\ , \\omega ( t - \\delta t )    \\ , { \\bf \\hat \\imath }   \\ : +    \\ :   \\sin \\ ,   \\omega ( t - \\delta t )    \\ , { \\bf \\hat \\jmath }   ] \\\\   & \\approx & r_2 \\ ,   [ \\cos \\ ,   \\omega t \\ : + \\ :   \\omega \\delta t     \\ : \\sin   \\ ,   \\omega t ]   \\ ,   { \\bf \\hat \\imath } \\ :",

    "this last assumption is justified since , for classical rigid rotation , @xmath158 , while @xmath159 , so that @xmath160 .    hence , the delay torque on the electron is given by    @xmath161    to a first approximation , we may use @xmath162 , where @xmath163 , is the ratio of the electron to proton mass .",
    "accordingly , @xmath164 , and , further using @xmath165 , the expression for the delay torque simplifies to    @xmath166    on the other hand , for the ` average ' force due to ( 3rd order ) radiation reaction , we have the well - known formula@xmath167    @xmath168    for the case under consideration ,    @xmath169    hence , the torque due to radiation damping    @xmath170    the two torques are oppositely directed .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for conservation of angular momentum is    @xmath171    which gives    @xmath172    or    @xmath173    once the constraint of rigid rotation is removed , many such equilibrium solutions may well exist , with or without radiative damping .",
    "we note , incidentally , this condition for conservation of angular momentum is quite different from the classical condition for balance of forces , which requires @xmath174 .",
    "both conditions can hold simultaneously only for one value of @xmath175 which is smaller than the bohr radius .",
    "thus , further investigations are required to determine the exact effects of radiative damping , and it was prematurely concluded that radiative damping makes the classical hydrogen atom unstable .",
    "the _ discreteness _ of the observed hydrogen spectrum has been regarded as another compelling argument against classical electrodynamics .",
    "solutions of fde s can , however , admit an infinite discrete spectrum .",
    "thus , for example , consider the _ retarded harmonic oscillator _ , given by the linear , second order , retarded fde    @xmath176    it is easy to see that a function of the form    @xmath177    for complex @xmath178 , is a solution of the equation ( [ rhm ] ) if and only if @xmath178 is a solution of the _ quasi_-polynomial equation    @xmath179    it is equally easy to see that the quasi - polynomial equation ( [ quasi ] ) has _ infinitely many _",
    "complex solutions @xmath180 , and it is known@xmath181 that the roots are discrete , with no cluster point , and that the large magnitude roots are given asymptotically by the approximate expression    @xmath182    @xmath183    where @xmath184 , and @xmath185 as @xmath186 .",
    "( had we dropped the retardation from ( [ rhm ] ) , and applied the same procedure instead to the usual harmonic oscillator , given by the ode @xmath187 , that would have led , in the well - known way , to a quadratic polynomial @xmath188 with exactly one pair of complex conjugate roots : @xmath189 , and @xmath190 . )",
    "since the equation ( [ rhm ] ) is linear , any linear combination of these infinitely many oscillatory solutions of the form ( [ exponent ] ) is again a solution .",
    "setting aside questions of convergence , it is clear that any _ finite _ linear combination of the form    @xmath191    with @xmath178 given by ( [ roots ] ) , say , is also a solution of ( [ rhm ] ) .",
    "that is , in physical terms , the retarded harmonic oscillator , governed by the simple linear fde ( [ rhm ] ) , exhibits an infinite spectrum of discrete frequencies .",
    "the general solution is a convergent linear combination of oscillations at an _ infinity _ of discrete ( ` quantized ' ) frequencies . as in quantum mechanics , to determine a unique solution one needs to know an ` initial ' function .",
    "if the initial function is prescribed arbitrarily , we can expect discontinuities .",
    "the above considerations remain valid for any linear fde with constant coefficients and constant delay.@xmath192 the locally linear approximation@xmath193 suggests that such ` quantization ' is also to be expected for the non - linear fde s of the electrodynamic 2-body problem .",
    "[ for the fde ( [ fde ] ) this approximation may be obtained simply by replacing @xmath194 by its first - order ` taylor ' expansion , and then freezing the values of the delays @xmath23 , in a neighborhood of the point at which we want to approximate the solution . ]",
    "mere discreteness of the spectrum does not , of course , mean that the fde formulation , using retarded electrodynamics , will correctly reproduce the actual spectrum of the hydrogen atom .",
    "equally , mere discreteness of the spectrum was not an adequate argument _ against _ the classical hydrogen atom , which was prematurely rejected on the basis of the ode formulation of the 2-body problem of electrodynamics .",
    "though a further investigation of fde s may still lead to a rejection of the classical hydrogen atom for the right reasons , it could , on the other hand , well help to clarify the ` missing link ' between classical and quantum mechanics , as in the structured - time interpretation of quantum mechanics.@xmath195",
