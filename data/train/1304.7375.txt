    "is well known that the complex envelope of a real - valued bandpass wide - sense stationary ( wss ) random process is proper , i.e. , its complementary auto - covariance ( a.k.a .",
    "the pseudo - covariance ) function vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , there are a lot of important improper - complex random processes that do not have vanishing complementary auto - covariance functions @xcite . for example , the complex envelope of a real - valued bandpass nonstationary signal is not necessarily proper and even the complex envelope of a real - valued bandpass wss signal becomes improper in the presence of the imbalance between its in - phase and quadrature components @xcite . in order to fully capture the statistical properties of a complex - valued signal , including all the second - order statistics , the filtering of augmented signals has been proposed .",
    "this so - called widely linear ( wl ) filtering processes either the signal augmented by its complex conjugate or the real part of the signal augmented by the imaginary part @xcite , where the former is referred to as the linear - conjugate linear ( lcl ) filtering @xcite .    on the other hand , many digitally modulated signals are well modeled by wide - sense cyclostationary ( wscs ) random processes @xcite , whose complex envelopes possess periodicity in all variables of the mean and the auto - covariance functions . to efficiently extract the correlation structure of a wscs random process in the time and",
    "the frequency domains , the translation series representation ( tsr ) and the harmonic series representation ( hsr ) are proposed @xcite , which are linear periodically time - varying ( ptv ) processings . using these representations , it is shown @xcite that a proper - complex wscs scalar random process can be converted to an equivalent proper - complex wss vector random process .",
    "such second - order structure of a proper - complex wscs random process has long been exploited in the design of many communications and signal processing systems including presence detectors @xcite , estimators @xcite , and optimal transceivers @xcite under various criteria .",
    "the complex envelopes of the majority of digitally modulated signals are proper and wscs . however , as well documented in @xcite , there still remain many other digitally modulated signals such as pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) , offset quaternary phase - shift keying ( oqpsk ) , and gaussian minimum shift keying ( gmsk ) , that are not only improper - complex wscs but also second - order cyclostationary ( socs ) @xcite , i.e. , the complementary auto - covariance function is also periodic in all its variables with the same period as the mean and the auto - covariance functions . to exploit both cyclostationarity and impropriety , the lcl frequency shift ( fresh ) filter has been proposed in @xcite that combines signal augmentation and linear ptv processing .",
    "recently , another lcl ptv operator called the properizing fresh ( p - fresh ) vectorizer is proposed in @xcite by non - trivially extending the hsr .",
    "the p - fresh vectorizer converts an _ improper - complex _ socs scalar random process to an equivalent _ proper - complex _ wss vector random process by exploiting the frequency - domain correlation and complementary correlation structures that are rigorously examined in @xcite . by successfully deriving the capacity of an socs gaussian noise channel , it is shown that the optimal channel input is improper - complex socs in general when the interfering signal is improper - complex socs .",
    "it is also well demonstrated that such properization provides the advantage of enabling the adoption of the conventional signal processing techniques and algorithms that utilize only the correlation but not the complementary correlation structure .",
    "these results warrant further research in communications and signal processing on the efficient construction and processing of improper - complex socs random processes .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the block processing of a complex - valued random vector that is obtained by taking a finite number of consecutive samples from a discrete - time ( dt ) improper - complex socs random process . to proceed ,",
    "the p - fresh vectorization developed for continuous - time ( ct ) socs random processes is first extended to dt improper - complex socs random processes . instead of straightforwardly modifying the ct p - fresh vectorizer that properizes as well as vectorizes the input ct improper - complex socs random process",
    ", an invertible lcl operator is proposed in this paper that does not vectorize but only properizes the input dt improper - complex socs random process .",
    "thus , the lcl operator is named the dt fresh properizer and its output does not need vector processing .",
    "specifically , the dt fresh properizer transforms a dt improper - complex socs scalar random process into an equivalent proper - complex socs scalar random process with the cycle period that is twice the cycle period of the input process .    to make this idea of pre - processing by properization better suited for digital signal processing , an invertible lcl block processing operator",
    "is then proposed that mimics the operation of the dt fresh properizer .",
    "although the augmentation of the improper - complex random vector by its complex conjugate can generate a sufficient statistic @xcite , it is not only a redundant information of twice the length of the original observation vector but also improper .",
    "although the strong uncorrelating transform ( sut ) of the observation vector can generate a highly - structured sufficient statistic of the same length as the original observation vector @xcite , the output is still improper and , moreover , it requires the information about both the correlation and the complementary correlation matrices of the improper - complex random vector input for the transformation .",
    "thus , neither the augmenting pre - processor nor the sut allows the direct application of the conventional techniques and algorithms dedicated to the block processing of proper - complex random vectors .",
    "motivated by how the dt fresh properizer works in the frequency domain , the pre - processor proposed in this paper utilizes the centered discrete fourier transform ( dft ) and the information only about the cycle period of the dt improper - complex socs random process in order to convert a finite number of consecutive samples of the random process to an equivalent random vector . unlike the output of the dt fresh properizer , the output of this lcl block processing operator is not proper but approximately proper for sufficiently large block size .",
    "thus , the pre - processor is named the asymptotic fresh properizer .",
    "specifically , the asymptotic fresh properizer makes the sequence of the complementary covariance matrices of the output asymptotically equivalent @xcite to the sequence of all - zero matrices .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the complex - valued random vector consisting of a finite number of consecutive samples of a dt _ proper - complex _ socs random process has its frequency - domain covariance matrix that approaches a block matrix with diagonal blocks as the number of samples increases .",
    "this is because the periodicity in the second - order statistics of the dt socs random process naturally leads to a sequence of block toeplitz covariance matrices as the number of samples increases , the sequence of block toeplitz matrices is asymptotically equivalent to a sequence of block circulant matrices , and a block circulant matrix becomes a block matrix with diagonal blocks when pre- and post - multiplied by dft and inverse dft matrices , respectively .",
    "since the asymptotic fresh properizer mimics the dt fresh properizer and the dt fresh properizer outputs a dt _ proper - complex _ socs random process , it naturally becomes of interest to examine the asymptotic property of the frequency - domain covariance matrix of the asymptotic fresh properizer output .",
    "it turns out that the output of the asymptotic fresh properizer has the same property discovered in @xcite .",
    "such properties of the covariance and the complementary covariance matrices may be used in designing , under various optimality criteria , low - complexity post - processors that follow the asymptotic fresh properizer . in particular",
    ", a post - processor can be developed that approximates the output of the asymptotic fresh properizer by a proper - complex random vector having the block matrix with diagonal blocks that is asymptotically equivalent to the exact frequency - domain covariance matrix as its frequency - domain covariance matrix .",
    "of course , this technique makes the post - processor suboptimal that performs most of the main operations in the frequency domain .",
    "as the two asymptotic properties strongly suggest , however , if the block size is large enough , then the performance degradation may be negligible .",
    "it is already shown in @xcite that this is the case for the asymptotic property only of the covariance matrix , where a suboptimal frequency - domain equalizer is proposed that approximates the frequency - domain covariance matrix of a proper - complex socs interference by an asymptotically equivalent block matrix with diagonal blocks .",
    "it turns out that this equalizer not only achieves significantly lower computational complexity than the exact linear minimum mean - square error ( lmmse ) equalizer by exploiting the block structure of the frequency - domain covariance matrix , but also is asymptotically optimal in the sense that its average mean - squared error ( mse ) approaches that of the lmmse equalizer as the number of samples tends to infinity .    to demonstrate the simultaneous achievability of asymptotic optimality and low complexity by employing the post - processor that processes the output of the asymptotic fresh properizer and exploits the two asymptotic properties , we consider two representative estimation and detection problems",
    "first , for a dt improper - complex socs random signal in additive proper - complex white noise , a low - complexity signal estimator is proposed that is a linear function of the output of the asymptotic fresh properizer .",
    "it is shown that the average mse performance of the estimator approaches that of the widely linear minimum mean - squared error ( wlmmse ) estimator as the number of samples tends to infinity .",
    "second , for a dt improper - complex socs gaussian random signal in additive proper - complex white gaussian noise , a low - complexity signal presence detector is proposed whose test statistic is a quadratic function of the output of the asymptotic fresh properizer it is shown that the test statistic converges to the exact likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) statistic that is a quadratic function of the augmented observation vector with probability one ( w.p .",
    "@xmath0 ) as the number of samples tends to infinity .",
    "note that in both cases the asymptotic fresh properizer as the pre - processor utilizes only the information about the cycle period .",
    "thus , the adoption of adaptive estimation and detection algorithms may be possible that are developed for the processing of proper - complex random vectors .",
    "this advantage of employing the asymptotic fresh properizer may be taken in other communications and signal processing problems involving the block processing of dt improper - complex socs random processes .",
