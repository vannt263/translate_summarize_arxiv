    ", one expects that a solution of may contain discontinuities such as shocks or contact discontinuities even if a boundary condition is given by a smooth function .",
    "such discontinuities can be described through a weak formulation of . a shock and a contact discontinuity",
    "are characterized by a normal velocity . while the normal velocity is nonzero on a shock , the normal velocity on a contact discontinuity completely vanishes .",
    "more details are given in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "because of the difference , one needs different schemes to study a shock and a contact discontinuity . for the case of a shock problem",
    ", one can identify a shock as a graph by using nonzero normal velocity on the shock . owing to this advantage",
    ", the stability or instability of various shock phenomena have been investigated in many works(see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . for the case of a contact discontinuity , on the other hand , we need a different strategy due to the zero normal velocity on the contact discontinuity . for that reason",
    ", this subject has been studied in restricted regimes yet(@xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", s. chen proved the stability of steady mach reflection configuration in a bounded region in @xmath1 provided that an appropriate constant pressure is fixed on a cut - off boundary . in the mach reflection configuration , two reflected shocks are separated by a contact discontinuity . in @xcite , s. chen and b. fang proved the conditional stability of a reflection and a refraction of shocks occurred when an incident shock hits the interface , which is a contact discontinuity , of two different media . but still , the structural stability of a contact discontinuity under a general perturbation in unbounded domain is unknown .",
    "the main difficulty in study of a contact discontinuity is that the states on both sides of a contact discontinuity are unknown , so one needs to solve a free boundary problem with both sides of a free boundary to be determined . and , this is the main difference from a shock problem of euler system .",
    "the study of contact discontinuity is essential to understand a mach reflection , which is one of important but difficult subject .",
    "when a vertical incident shock hits an inclined ramp , if the incident shock is relatively strong or the angle of the ramp is relatively small , then the incident shock is reflected at a point away from the boundary of the ramp , and two reflected shocks are formed at the reflection point with a contact discontinuity in between .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ mach reflection , _ named after ernst mach .",
    "also , the mach reflection for steady euler system can be considered through shock polar analysis(see @xcite ) .",
    "it is conjectured that the steady mach reflection in @xmath1 is structurally stable .",
    "in order to prove this conjecture , one needs to prove stability of a contact discontinuity along with two reflected shocks . in this paper",
    ", we prove structural stability of a contact discontinuity in an infinite duct where the flow on both sides of the contact discontinuity is subsonic .",
    "this is related to the case where two reflected shocks are transonic shocks in steady mach reflection .",
    "we fix a flat duct @xmath0 of infinite length in @xmath1 with width of @xmath2 , and consider two uniform subsonic flow in @xmath0 divided by a flat contact discontinuity @xmath4 .",
    "then we perturb the boundary of @xmath0 with a small @xmath29 function so that the width of the perturbed duct converges to @xmath5 for @xmath6 at @xmath7 for some small constant @xmath8",
    ". then we want to show that there exists two layers of subsonic flow divided by a contact discontinuity in the perturbed nozzle , and that the new contact discontinuity is a small perturbation of @xmath4 .",
    "it is a new feature that we allow for a perturbed contact discontinuity to converge to different asymptotic states at @xmath30 .",
    "since the right asymptotic width @xmath5 of a perturbed nozzle is not necessarily same as the width @xmath2 at @xmath14 , we expect for the asymptotic pressure @xmath31 at @xmath7 to be different from the asymptotic pressure @xmath32 at @xmath14 , and this yields two different asymptotic states for a perturbed contact discontinuity at @xmath30 .",
    "details are given in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "another interesting aspect is application of the result from @xcite to this work . like a shock problem ,",
    "a contact discontinuity problem is a free boundary problem .",
    "but unlike a shock problem , the states on both sides of a contact discontinuity @xmath33 is unknown .",
    "moreover since the normal velocity on @xmath33 is zero , it is not clear how to locate a position of @xmath33 .",
    "so we use the euler - lagrange transformation to reformulate the contact discontinuity problem as a fixed boundary problem .",
    "then the new difficulty is to find a weak solution of a first order nonlinear elliptic - hyperbolic mixed system so that the weak solution satisfies the rankine - hugoniot jump condition on a fixed boundary .",
    "if we can show that the weak solution is piecewise @xmath15 in two subregions divided by the flattened contact discontinuity @xmath34 , then a simple integration by parts shows that the weak solution indeed satisfies the rankine - hugoniot jump condition on @xmath34 . from this point of view , we employ the result of @xcite to achieve piecewise @xmath15 regularity of weak solution for a nonlinear elliptic - hyperbolic mixed system . according to theorem 1.1 of @xcite ,",
    "if a discontinuity boundary , which is a contact discontinuity in our case , is in @xmath35 for @xmath36 , then the regularity of a corresponding weak solution to a uniformly elliptic equation is weaker than piecewise @xmath35 regularity .",
    "but , this may cause a difficulty in the iteration procedure which is the way to solve our main problem .",
    "fortunately , the euler - lagrange transformation transforms a contact discontinuity to a flat boundary which is smooth .",
    "hence , there is no deterioration of regularity of weak solutions to elliptic equations in the iteration , and this is an advantage of the euler - lagrange transformation .    in section [ sec2 ] , we compute asymptotic states at far field in a perturbed duct , and use the euler - lagrange transformation to reformulate our problem as a fixed boundary problem .",
    "then we state our main theorems . in section [ sec3 ] , we establish piecewise @xmath15 regularity of weak solutions to euler system , and use this estimate to prove the main theorems . the main difficulty would be uniform @xmath37 estimate of weak solutions to a class of uniformly elliptic equations in unbounded domain especially because we have two different asymptotic states at far field @xmath14 and @xmath7 .",
