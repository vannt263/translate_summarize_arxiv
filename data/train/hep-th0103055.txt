    "renormalization group ( rg ) methods have been developed @xcite to carry out qualitative studies of regions of quantum field theories which are not accessible to perturbation theory in the coupling constant . for theories in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions",
    "these methods admit particularly powerful realizations in form of explicit constructions of scaling functions .",
    "such functions may be obtained either from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite , from correlations functions involving various components of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite or from semi - classical studies @xcite . in general the functions obtained from different approaches",
    "differ quantitatively , but nonetheless possess the same qualitative features characterized as follows :    we consider a quantum field theory which contains asymptotically stable particles of mass @xmath1 and unstable particles with mass @xmath2 .",
    "in addition we assume that there are no particles associated to asymptotic massless states in the spectrum .",
    "then the scaling function @xmath3 parameterized by a dimensionless renormalization group parameter @xmath4 has the properties : it    1 .",
    "coincides with the virasoro central charge @xmath5 of the ultraviolet conformal field theory for vanishing @xmath6@xmath7 2 .",
    "is non - increasing along the rg flow , 3 .",
    "is stationary at rg fixed points and acquires at these points the virasoro central charge of specific conformal field theories @xmath8 4 .",
    "vanishes in the infrared @xmath9    there is yet another proposal to construct such type of functions , namely as `` bailey flow '' @xcite between different series of virasoro characters .",
    "however , so far it has neither been established whether the functions constructed in this fashion satisfy the properties i)-iv ) nor has it been clarified in which way they are related to a massive quantum field theory .    in the following we shall be constructing a scaling function which also flows between certain virasoro characters . in addition to the flows provided in @xcite , we will not only propose a flow between several distinct series , such as for instance from n=2 superconformal theories to n=1 superconformal theories , but also realize the flows within a particular series itself .",
    "our flows are manifested by means of q - deformed cartan matrices which simulate a control of the energy scales of unstable particles .",
    "we establish that the proposed function indeed satisfies the properties i)-iv ) and in addition relate it to a concrete massive quantum field theory with an explicitly known scattering matrix .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we recall how certain recurrence relations emerge from a saddle point analysis of fermionic versions of virasoro characters , which involve data of the massive theory , namely the phase of the scattering matrix , and how their solutions are related to the effective central charge .",
    "we show that various series may be realized in terms of the hsg - models . in section 3",
    "we present a q - deformed version of the analysis in section 2 and demonstrate how the hsg - realization allows for a flow amongst various models governed by the mass scales of the unstable particles . the analysis in this section",
    "is mainly carried out numerically .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the explicit analytic solutions at the plateaux in terms of weyl characters .",
    "we present here various cases which have not been considered before . in section 5",
    "we demonstrate how the q - deformed characters may be associated to particle spectra , which involve also unstable pseudo - particles .",
    "our conclusions are stated in section 6 .",
    "let us first recall some well - known facts in order to assemble the relevant equations and to establish our notations .",

    "there might be restrictions on the set @xmath28 in which @xmath29 takes its values , which usually reflect some of the symmetries in the model .",
    "the important thing for us to note is that once @xmath17 is of the generic form ( [ chi ] ) , one may employ the techniques originally pursuit in @xcite and carry out a saddle point analysis to extract the leading order behaviour . as a result of this , the effective central charge , i.e. @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the smallest conformal dimension occurring in the theory ( @xmath32 in unitary models ) ,",

    "the important point to note here is that the saddle point analysis does not rely upon the fact that the matrices @xmath19 and @xmath36 are constant .",
    "it is this feature which we shall exploit below .",
    "intriguingly the same set of equations ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ ceff ] ) may also be obtained when we commence with the massive instead of the conformal side .",

    "@xcite one ends up with a set of non - linear integral equations in the pseudo - energies as functions of the rapidities , the so - called tba - equations .",
    "we then assume that the s - matrix is such that it leads to regions in the tba - equations in which the pseudo - energies are constant .",
    "in general this happens when the scattering matrix does not depend on the effective coupling constant .",
    "in that situation , the thermodynamic bethe ansatz leads to a set of coupled equations coinciding precisely with the ones in @xmath47 in ( [ ctba ] ) .",

    "the matrix @xmath19 in ( [ chi ] ) is now directly related to the massive models containing the information about the scattering matrix @xmath48 reversing the argument , the relation ( [ ph ] ) means that one has identified a quantity within the conformal field theory which carries the data of the phase of the s - matrix .    in the following",
    "we will consider theories in which @xmath49 is related to a lie algebraic structure .",
    "for this purpose we give the quantum numbers @xmath50 , which describe the particle type , an additional substructure .",

    "the full system ( [ ctba ] ) and ( [ ceff ] ) , involving a non - trivial @xmath36-matrix , can be associated in general with a non - diagonal scattering matrix on the massive side .",
    "a straightforward identification between @xmath19 and the scattering matrix such as in ( [ ph ] ) is not possible in this case .",
    "however , within the thermodynamic bethe ansatz analysis the equations are diagonalized and decoupled , such that at the fixed points they acquire precisely the form ( [ ctba ] ) . in many prominent cases",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath36 matrices involve lie algebraic quantities in the form of ( [ m ] ) . noting this point , many models can be realized formally in terms of * gg*-cosets .",

    "the relation ( [ hsgmin ] ) allows for various interpretations with regard to the realizations of several rg - flows .",
    "we note that both theories on the l.h.s . do not contain any unstable particle . a flow between cosets parameterized by different @xmath72 s",
    "may then be achieved in the so - called massless way as roaming trajectories in the spirit of @xcite . on the other hand , the realizations in form of the r.h.s . of ( [ hsgmin ] )",
    "constitute theories which contain unstable particles .",
    "therefore a flow between cosets related to different @xmath72 s is achievable in a well controllable fashion over the different energy scales of the unstable particles as observed in @xcite for the hsg - models . for vanishing resonance parameters @xmath77 the system on the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ hsgmin ] ) leads to the same constant tba - equations as found for the rsos - models @xcite .",
    "in addition following the rg - flow of the scaling function of the tba one observes that at the fixed points , the set of equations ( [ ctba ] ) is also obtained for finite values of the resonance parameters .",
    "of course these coset realizations are not unique and one may for instance also obtain ( [ n0 ] ) from the quaternionic projective space @xmath78 @xcite or use various exceptional lie algebras to construct particular theories .",

    "we now wish to introduce a mass scale . recalling @xcite that the recurrence relations ( [ ctba ] ) may be solved by means of weyl characters",
    "a natural conjecture is to suspect that a deformation of these expressions leads to a correct description of the massive theories in the sense of the full tba - equations . to make this concrete seems a rather difficult task and we therefore construct a scaling function in a different way , but nonetheless in the spirit of the renormalization group ideas . instead of using a different parameterization for the weyl characters , we deform the virasoro characters ( [ chi ] ) in a very natural way .",

    "the q - deformation is mainly inspired by the physics of the unstable particles .",
    "the natural mass scale of the unstable particle @xmath101 , with @xmath77 playing the role of a resonance parameter and @xmath14 of an overall mass scale , is introduced in @xmath102 in such a way that for @xmath103 , the cartan matrix of * g * decouples according to the `` cutting rule '' analyzed in @xcite .",

    "in order to make our main point , namely that ( [ cqr ] ) indeed constitutes a scaling function which reproduces the characteristic features of the theory , like the ones obtainable from the conventional tba , the scaled version of the c - theorem or a semi - classical analysis , we have to establish that @xmath114 satisfies indeed the properties i)-iv ) in the introduction .",
    "most straightforward to prove are the properties related to the extremal limits .",
    "property i ) is easily established since by construction @xmath115 is the ultraviolet virasoro central charge .",
    "property iv ) follows from the following argument : let us first assume in ( [ qr ] ) that the @xmath116 s are finite for @xmath117 . taking then this limit leads to  @xmath118 , such that our initial assumption can not hold and we deduce that @xmath119 @xmath120 . when we want to avoid that the scaling function ( [ cqr ] ) becomes complex we have to assume that the @xmath121 s are real .",

    "the @xmath128-theories are good theories to start with , since they do not involve any stable particle fusing structure .",
    "in addition several scaling functions have been obtained by a tba analysis @xcite and also from the scaled version of the c - theorem @xcite , such that we have already data available to compare with .",

    "equation ( [ aa ] ) becomes in this case simply @xmath131 .",
    "it is not possible to solve this relation analytically , but near the ultraviolet we may approximate @xmath132 such that its solution becomes @xmath133 for @xmath134 , and therefore @xmath135 we can compare this with the scaling function obtained as exact solution of the full tba analysis @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a modified bessel function .",
    "the latter estimate follows from @xmath138 for @xmath134 and the fact that @xmath139 .",
    "this means in the main region of interest these two functions coincide .",
    "it is also clear that for large @xmath140 that both functions vanish .",
    "in addition we may compare with the scaling function obtained from the c - theorem @xmath141 which shows a similar behaviour .",
    "note that despite the fact that we use @xmath140 in ( [ lm991])-([lm993 ] ) the meaning of this parameter is different in each context .",
    "for our purposes it is simply a dimensionless variable .",
    "let us now establish property ii ) for this case .",
    "this illustrates at the same time the general procedure which works in principle for all other situations . since we know that @xmath142 and @xmath143 we just have to establish that @xmath144 does not posses a minimum or maximum in order to establish its monotonic behaviour .",
    "we compute from ( [ aa ] ) the derivative @xmath145 .",
    "obviously , for finite values of @xmath121 , this is only vanishing for @xmath146 , which is however not a solution of ( [ aa ] ) .",

    "property iii ) holds trivially in this case .      for the other cases one may in principle proceed in a similar fashion , but",
    "already for the case @xmath148 the analysis becomes rather messy .",

    "we may then compute the second derivative and establish that this value corresponds to a saddle point , which , in comparison with our numerical solution exhibited in figure 1 , is indeed situated on the second plateau .    since an analytic solution of ( [ aa ] )",
    "is eluded from our analysis so far , we will now resort to a numerical analysis .",
    "for this purpose we discretize the equation @xmath151 _ { q_{ij}}}\\right ) ^{1/2}\\,\\ ,   \\label{qq}\\ ] ] and solve it iteratively in the usual fashion . assuming convergence of this procedure the value @xmath152",

    "we start with @xmath153 and set the initial value @xmath154 to be the analytically known ( see section 4 ) solutions of the constant tba - equations .",
    "once we have achieved convergence for a particular value of @xmath6 , we may increase this value by an amount @xmath155 and we take always as a starting value the previous solution of ( [ qq ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this procedure is extremely fast convergent even when the particle number involved is very high . in comparison with the full tba equations , ( [ qq ] )",
    "are by far easier to solve since they do not involve the complication of a convolution and correspond technically at each value of @xmath6 to a constant tba equation .",
