    "buoyancy or density gradients drive flows in the atmosphere and interiors of planets and stars , as well as in electronic devices and industrial appliances like heat exchangers , boilers , etc .",
    "accordingly , scientists ( including geo- , astro- , atmospheric- and solar physicists ) and engineers have been studying buoyancy - driven flows for more than a century . an important unsolved problem in this field is how to quantify the spectra and fluxes of kinetic energy and entropy ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the velocity and temperature fluctuations ) of buoyancy - driven flows  @xcite . in this paper , we will study these quantities and respective nonlinear fluxes using direct numerical simulations , and show that the kinetic energy ( ke ) spectrum differs from kolmogorov s theory when buoyancy is strong .    flows driven by buoyancy can be classified in two categories : ( a ) convective flows in which hotter and lighter fluid at the bottom rises , while colder and heavier fluid at the top comes down ; ( b ) stably stratified flows in which lighter fluid rests above heavier fluid .",
    "the convective flows are unstable ; but the stably stratified flows are stable , hence their fluctuations vanish over time . therefore , a steady state of a stably stratified flow is achieved only when it is driven by an external force .",
    "even though both types of flows are driven by density gradients , the properties of such flows are quite different , which we decipher using quantitative analysis of energy flux and energy supply rate by buoyancy .    for a stably stratified flow ,",
    "bolgiano  @xcite and obukhov  @xcite first proposed a phenomenology , according to which the ke flux @xmath0 of a stably stratified flow is depleted at different length scales due to a conversion of ke to `` potential energy '' via buoyancy ( @xmath12 ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath5 decreases with wavenumber , and the energy spectrum is steeper than that prediced by kolmogorov theory @xmath13 , where @xmath6 is the wavenumber ) ; we refer to the above as _ bo _ phenomenology or scaling . according to this phenomenology ,",
    "for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the bolgiano wavenumber  @xcite , the ke spectrum @xmath4 , entropy spectrum @xmath16 , @xmath0 , and entropy flux @xmath17 are : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the thermal expansion coefficient , acceleration due to gravity , and the entropy dissipation rate respectively , and @xmath22 s are constants . for the wavenumbers in the range @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the ke dissipation rate , and @xmath27 is the wavenumber after which dissipation starts .",
    "we remark that many researchers describe the stably stratified flows in terms of density fluctuation @xmath28 , which leads to an equivalent description since @xmath29 .",
    "several research groups studied the properties of stably stratified flows using numerical simulations .",
    "kimura and herring  @xcite observed _ bo _ scaling in a narrow band of wavenumbers in their @xmath30 decaying buoyancy - dominated simulation . in 2012 , using @xmath31 simulations , kimura and herring  @xcite showed that waves and vortex exhibit @xmath32 energy spectra at large wavenumbers , but for sufficiently strong stratification , the corresponding spectra are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , at small wavenumbers .",

    ", lvov  @xcite , lvov and falkovich  @xcite , and rubinstein  @xcite proposed that the _ bo _ scaling would also be applicable to rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) . the numerical and experimental results of rbc , however , have been largely inconclusive . based on simulations with periodic boundary conditions , borue and orszag  @xcite and kandera et al",

    "calzavarini et al .",
    "@xcite reported the _ bo _ scaling in the boundary layer , and the _ ko _ scaling in the bulk .",
    "the experimental results  @xcite are more divergent with some reporting the _ bo _ scaling , and some others reporting the _ ko _ scaling .    in this paper",
    "we simulate the stably stratified and rbc turbulence , and analyse the spectra and fluxes of the ke as well as the entropy .",
    "we show that for the stratified flow , the ke flux and spectrum follow the _ bo _ scaling ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eu]-[eq : pi ] ) ) when buoyancy is strong , but they follow the _ ko _ scaling for weak buoyancy .",
    "the ke flux in rbc however increases at small wavenumbers , but remains flat for a narrow wavenumber band in the intermediate regime where the energy spectrum follows the _ ko _ scaling .",

    "therefore , for obtaining a steady state in a stably stratified flow , we force the flow at small wavenumbers with random forcing prescribed by kimura and herring  @xcite .    in this paper , we contrast the scaling relations of stably stratified flow and rbc in a single formalism . for the same , we use temperature fluctuations",

    "[ fig : ke_specra_rbc](a ) , we plot the normalized ke spectra for the _ bo _ and the _ ko _ scaling .",
    "the plots indicate that the _ ko _ scaling fits better than the _ bo _ scaling for a narrow band of wavenumbers ( the shaded region , @xmath218 ) .",
    "we plot the ke and entropy fluxes in fig  [ fig : ke_specra_rbc](b ) .",
    "we also plot a zoomed view of the energy flux in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_details ] , according to which ke flux increases till @xmath219 , and then starts to decrease . in the logarithmic scale ,",
    "the ke flux is an approximate constant for the wavenumbers @xmath218 , a band where @xmath7 .",
    "thus we claim that convective turbulence exhibits kolmogorov s power law for a narrow band of wavenumbers .",
    "interestingly , the energy spectrum of rbc exhibits stronger fluctuations than that of stably stratified turbulence ; this feature is possibly due to the  plumes \" emanating from the plates .",
    "this feature as well as a larger range of wavenumber exhibiting _ ko _ scaling may be visible in a large resolution simulation , which is planned as a future study .",
    "further investigations of @xmath100 , @xmath5 , and @xmath122 provide stronger evidence for the _ ko _ scaling in rbc .",
    "we plot these quantities in figs .",
    "[ fig : flux_details ] and [ fig : deriv_rbc ] , according to which @xmath220 , consistent with the discussion of sec .  [ sec : gov_eqns ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sch_flux](b ) .",
    "in addition , for the wavenumber band @xmath221 , @xmath125 , hence , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpik_dk ] ) , @xmath222 . therefore , @xmath5 increases in this band of wavenumbers , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_details ] .",
    "but for @xmath223 , we find that @xmath224 leading to @xmath225 , therefore , @xmath5 decreases with @xmath6 for this range of @xmath6 . however , for a narrow band of wavenumbers @xmath218 , @xmath127 , hence @xmath226 or @xmath227 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath5 yields @xmath7 , consistent with the energy spectrum plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : ke_specra_rbc ] . note that many simulations , including mishra and verma  @xcite , reported that @xmath3 for moderate @xmath228 , but the decrease of @xmath5 in their work is essentially due to @xmath102 , not due to buoyancy .",
    "thus , the flux and energy supply due to buoyancy reveal that convective turbulence follows _ ko _ scaling , at least for a narrow range of wavenumbers .",
    "scaling is ruled out for rbc since @xmath220 .",
    "the entropy @xmath229 is a useful quantity in rbc . the entropy flux , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ke_specra_rbc](b ) , is constant for the narrow inertial range @xmath230 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pe_specra_rbc ] , we plot the entropy spectrum that exhibits dual branch , with the upper branch scaling as @xmath231 . mishra and verma  @xcite , and pandey et al .",
    "@xcite showed the dominant temperature modes @xmath232 , which are approximately @xmath233 where @xmath234 is an integer , constitute the @xmath231 branch of the entropy spectrum .",
    "they showed that @xmath232 modes are responsible for the steep temperature variations in the thermal boundary layers of the plates .",
    "interestingly , the temperature modes in both the branches of the entropy spectrum participate to yield a constant entropy flux in the inertial range .",
    "we performed large resolution simulations of stably stratified flows and rayleigh bnard convection , and studied the spectra and fluxes of the kinetic energy and entropy .",
    "we also compute the energy supply rate due to buoyancy that provide important clues on the underlying turbulence phenomena .    for stably stratified turbulence ,",
    "we show that the kinetic energy spectrum @xmath1 , the energy flux @xmath3 , the entropy spectrum @xmath2 , and the entropy flux @xmath235 , in agreement with the prediction of bolgiano and obukhov , referred to as _",
    "bo _ scaling .",
    "we also compute the energy supply rate by buoyancy , and find that to be negative , signalling the buoyancy - induced conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy .    for the rayleigh bnard convection",
    ", the energy supply rate due to buoyancy , @xmath100 , is positive .",
    "hence the kinetic energy flux @xmath236 first increases with @xmath6 , and then flattens for a narrow band of wavenumbers , and finally decreases with @xmath6 ; the three regimes correspond to @xmath125 , @xmath127 , and @xmath131 , respectively , where @xmath102 is the dissipation spectrum .",
    "we observe kolmogorov s spectrum ( @xmath32 ) for wavenumbers where @xmath127 or @xmath227 .",
    "thus , a detailed investigation of the kinetic energy flux , the energy supply due to buoyancy , and the dissipation spectrum provide valuable inputs that rule out _ bo _ scaling for rbc , contrary to the predictions of procaccia and zeitak  @xcite , lvov  @xcite , lvov and falkovich  @xcite , and rubinstein  @xcite .",
    "the entropy flux for rbc is constant in the inertial range , but the entropy spectrum exhibit dual branch , whose origin is related to the thermal boundary layer .    in summary ,",
    "stably stratified flows exhibit _ bo _ scaling in buoyancy dominated regime .",
    "turbulent convection however exhibits kolmogorov s spectrum , rather than _ bo _ spectrum .",
    "a recent shell model of buoyancy - driven flows  @xcite shows similar results .",
    "more work , specially very large resolution simulations , are required to explore dual spectra predicted by bolgiano and obukhov .",
    "our numerical simulations were performed at centre for development of advanced computing ( cdac ) and ibm blue gene p  shaheen \" at kaust supercomputing laboratory , saudi arabia .",
