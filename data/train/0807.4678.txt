    "this is a very exciting time for cosmology with the overwhelming amount of new observational data that theorists try to explain .",
    "one of the biggest puzzles that the theoretical community faces is to explain the recent speed up in the universe rate of expansion discovered first through observations from distant type ia supernova a decade ago @xcite .",
    "this late - time acceleration of the universe has been latter on confirmed by other independent observational probes based for example on measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the clustering of galaxies on very large scales and the baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite .",
    "a plethora of different theoretical models have been so far proposed to explain this phenomenon @xcite , although unfortunately none of the models advanced so far is both completely convincing and well motivated .",
    "a cosmological constant corresponding to roughly two thirds of the total energy density of the universe is perhaps the simplest way to explain the late - time speed up of the universe and in addition would match rather well the observational data .",
    "however , the expected theoretical value of the cosmological constant is about 120 orders of magnitude larger than the value needed to fit the data @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to explain the late - time acceleration is to invoke an infrared modification of general relativity on large scales which , by weakening the gravitational interaction on those scales , allows the recent speed up of the universal expansion .",
    "this approach is also motivated by the fact that we only have precisions observations of gravity from sub - millimiter scales up to solar system scales while the hubble radius , which is the scale relevant for the cosmic acceleration , is many orders of magnitude larger .",
    "a quite promising scheme in this approach is the dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite which corresponds to a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) induced gravity brane - world model @xcite , where a low - energy modification occurs with respect to general relativity ; i.e. an infrared effect takes place , leading to two branches of solutions : ( i ) the self - accelerating branch and ( ii ) the normal branch .",
    "as it name would suggest the self - accelerating branch solution gives rise to a late - time accelerating brane universe .",
    "the acceleration of the brane expansion arises naturally , even without invoking the presence of any dark energy on the brane to produce the speed - up .",
    "not surprisingly therefore this self - accelerated feature of the dgp model has lead to considerable research activity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been recently shown that by embedding the dgp model in a higher dimensional space - time the ghost issue present in the original model @xcite may be curred @xcite while preserving the existence of a self - accelerating solution @xcite .",
    "the normal branch also constitutes in itself a very interesting result of the dgp model however , as it can mimic a phantom - like behaviour on the brane by means of the @xmath1dgp scenario @xcite . at this respect",
    "we remind the reader that observational data do not seem incompatible with a phantom - like behaviour @xcite and therefore we should keep an open mind about what is producing the recent inflationary era of our universe . on the other hand , this phantom - like behaviour may well be a property acquired only recently by dark energy .",
    "this leads to an interest in building models that exhibit the so called crossing of the phantom divide line @xmath0 ; for example in the context of the brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "the most important aspect of the @xmath1dgp model is that the phantom - like mimicry is obtained without invoking any real phantom - matter @xcite which is known to violate the null energy condition and induce quantum instabilities @xcite . in the dgp scenario",
    "it is also possible to obtain a mimicry of the crossing of the phantom divide at the cost of invoking a dynamical dark energy on the brane @xcite , for example modelled by a quiessence fluid or a ( generalised ) chaplygin gas .    in this paper",
    "we will show that there is an alternative form of mimicking the crossing the cosmological constant line @xmath0 in the brane - world scenario .",
    "more precisely , we consider a 5d dilatonic bulk with a brane endowed with ( or without ) an induced gravity term , a brane matter content corresponding to cold dark matter , and a brane tension @xmath2 that depends on the minimally coupled bulk scalar field .",
    "we will show that in this set - up the normal branch expands in an accelerated way due to @xmath2 playing the role of _ dark energy _",
    "through its dependence on the bulk scalar field .",
    "in addition , it turns out that @xmath2 grows with the brane scale factor until it reaches a maximum positive value and then starts decreasing .",
    "therefore , in our model the brane tension mimics crossing the phantom divide .",
    "most importantly no matter violating the null energy density is invoked in our model .",
    "the paper can be outlined as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we describe the general bulk plus brane scenario ; in section [ sec3 ] we then analyse the vacuum ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) solution to prepare the ground for the analysis carried out in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "there we show that , under some assumptions on the nature of the coupling parameters between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 changes sign as the brane evolves , with @xmath6 the effective equation of state for the brane tension . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we show that the the presence of the induced gravity term is not a necessary ingredient in order to mimic the crossing of the phantom divide line in this context .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix [ appendix ] we present an analytical proof for the mimicry of the crossing of the phantom divide in the model presented in section  [ sec2 ] .",

    "this property in principle can not be extended to a 5d dilatonic bulk . on the other hand ,",
    "we stress that the presence of an induced gravity term in the brane - world scenario affects only the dynamics of the brane , through the junction conditions at the brane , and does not affect the bulk field equations .",
    "consequently , in order to study the effect of an induced gravity term in a brane - world dilatonic model , it is possible to consider a bulk corresponding to a dilatonic 5d space - time and later on impose the junction conditions at the brane location .",

    "we remind the reader that at the brane @xmath51 .",
    "notice that for @xmath52 the left hand side ( lhs ) term in eq .",

    "( [ friedmann ] ) ) can be solved analytically in this case @xcite and it can be explicitly shown that the brane tension decreases as the brane expands . in the same way a parametric expression can be found for the hubble rate and its cosmic derivative .",
    "[ footnote3 ] ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) ) . for small values of the scale factor",
    ", the brane tension reaches infinite positive values . on the other hand , for very large value of the scale factor",
    "the brane tension vanishes .",
    "the hubble parameter is a decreasing function of the scale factor , i.e the brane is never super - accelerating .",
    "in fact , @xmath56 while the israel junction condition ( [ friedmann1 ] ) implies that the denominator of the previous equation has to be positive ( see also footnote [ footnote3 ] ) , therefore @xmath57 . at high energy , @xmath58 reaches a constant positive value .",
    "consequently , in the vacuum brane there is no big bang singularity on the brane ; indeed , the brane is asymptotically de sitter . on the other hand , at very large values of the scale factor , the hubble parameter vanishes ( the brane is asymptotically minkowski in the future ) .",
    "although the brane never super - accelerates , the brane always undergoes an inflationary period .",
    "the brane behaves in two different ways depending on the value taken by @xmath59 .",
    "thus , for @xmath60 the brane is eternally inflating .",
    "a similar behaviour was found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath61 the brane undergoes an initial stage of inflation and later on it starts decelerating .",
    "this second behaviour contrasts with the results in @xcite for a vacuum brane without an induced gravity term on the brane .",
    "then , the inclusion of an induced gravity term on a dilatonic brane - world model with an exponential potential in the bulk allows for the normal branch to inflate in a region of parameter space where the vacuum dilatonic brane alone would not inflate .",
    "this behaviour has some similarity with steep inflation @xcite , where high energy corrections to the friedmann equation in rs scenario @xcite permit an inflationary evolution of the brane with potentials too steep to sustain it in the standard 4d case , although the inflationary scenario introduced by copeland et al in @xcite is supported by an inflaton confined in the brane while in our model inflation on the brane is induced by a dilaton field on the bulk .",
    "the important thing we have learned from the vacuum solution for our next step of model building is that the brane is eternally inflating if @xmath60 .",
    "we will next show that if this condition holds in a brane filled with cdm ( together with others conditions that we will next enumerate ) , the brane tension will mimic a crossing of the cosmological constant line .",
    "we now address the main point of the paper : is it possible to mimic a crossing of the phantom divide in particular in the model introduced in section [ sec2 ] ? unlike the vacuum case which can be solved analytically @xcite in this case we can not exactly solve the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can answer the previous question based in some physical and reasonable assumptions and as well as on numerical methods . for technical details of the analytical proof",
    "we refer the reader to the appendix section .",
    "these are assumptions that we make :    1 .",
    "we assume that cdm dominates over the vacuum term ( @xmath62 ) at early times on the brane .",
    "this implies that the parameter @xmath63 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) ( see the appendix ) must satisfy @xmath64 . on the other hand",
    ", the brane tension will play the role of dark energy ( through its dependence on the scalar field ) in our model .",
    "this first assumption assumes that dark matter dominates over dark energy at high redshift which is a natural assumption to make .",
    "we also assume that cdm redshifts away a bit faster than usual ; i.e. @xmath65 or @xmath66 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) is such that @xmath67 .",
    "this lost energy will be used to increase the value of the scalar field @xmath68 on the brane .",
    "that is , to push the brane to higher values of @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we also assume that @xmath70 .",
    "this condition , together with @xmath71 , is sufficient to prove the non existence of a local minimum of the brane tension during the cosmological evolution of the brane .",
    "in fact , as we show in the appendix the existence of a unique maximum can be proven for an even larger set of parameters @xmath72 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",

    "we know that the vacuum term dominates at late times ( see the first assumption ) .",

    "then we can conclude that the brane will be speeding up at late times as long as @xmath81 .",

    "the amount of dark energy is about 3 times the amount of cdm @xcite ; i.e. @xmath110 and @xmath111    therefore , the constraints 1 and 3 implies that @xmath112 and @xmath27 have to be very small .",
    "this fact combined with the conditions 2 and 4 implies : @xmath113 where we have roughly estimated the size ( radius ) of the universe at the time of nucleasinthesis , @xmath114 , to be @xmath115 smaller than today .",
    "then we can conclude that the brane starts accelerating since it has half of its present size ( cf .",
    "( [ acc ] ) ) @xmath116 or at a redshift @xmath117 . on the other hand",
    ", the constraint on the ratio @xmath118 ( see eq.([constraintlr ] ) ) translates into a constraint @xmath119 for the crossing of the phantom divides by the brane tension to take place roughly at the same time when the brane starts speeding up .",
    "this strong fine tuning is inherited from imposing that the model is consistent since the epoque of nucleosynthesis .",
    "notice that ( i ) if this fine tuning is relaxed then the crossing of the phantom divide would take place in the past of the brane ; i.e the brane tension would been currently decreasing as the brane expands and would have a quintessence behaviour at present and ( ii ) if the fine tuning is made stronger then the brane tension would be still growing as the brane expands and the crossing of the phantom divide would take place in the future evolution of the brane .",
    "in this paper we have shown the existence of a mechanism that mimics the crossing of the cosmological constant line @xmath0 in the brane - world scenario , and which is different from the one introduced in refs .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that if we have a 5d dilatonic bulk with or without an induced gravity term on the brane ( normal branch ) , a brane tension @xmath2 which depends on the minimally coupled bulk scalar field , and a brane matter content corresponding only to cold dark matter , then under certain conditions the brane tension grows with the brane scale factor until it reaches a maximum positive value at which it mimics crossing the phantom divide , and then starts decreasing .",
    "most importantly no matter violating the null energy condition is invoked in our model . despite of the transitory phantom - like behaviour of the brane tension no big rip singularity is hited along the brane evolution .    in the model with an induced gravity term on the brane ( normal branch or non - self - accelerating branch ) ,",
    "the constraint equation fulfilled by the brane tension is too complicated to be solved analytically ( see eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) ) .",
    "however , we have shown that under certain physical and mathematical conditions -cold dark matter dominates at higher redshifts and it dilutes a bite faster than dust during the brane expansion as well as a mathematical condition that guarantees the non - existence of a local minimum of the brane tension- it is possible for the brane tension to cross the cosmological constant line . the analytical proof",
    "( see the appendix ) has been confirmed by numerical solutions .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for some values of the parameters the normal branch inflates eternally to the future due to the brane tension @xmath2 playing the role of dark energy through its dependence on the bulk scalar field .    on the other hand , in the model without an induced gravity term things",
    "are much easier to analyse as it is possible to get an analytical solution for the brane tension @xcite . for the analytical solution and under the same physical and mathematical conditions assumed in the model with an induced gravity effect",
    ", we have shown that the brane tension grows until it reaches its maximum positive value and then it starts decreasing driving the late - time acceleration of the brane .",
    "it is precisely at that maximum value that the brane tension mimics the crossing of the phantom divide as its effective equation of state parameter @xmath6 is such that @xmath5 changes its sign in a smooth way .",
    "we have also imposed observational bounds -from the dark matter equation of state @xcite and the big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite that constraints the modified friedmann equation and the effective gravitational constant of the brane- to constraint the parameters of the model .    in summary , in the model presented here the mimicry of the phantom divide crossing is based on the interaction between the brane and the bulk through the brane tension that depends explicitly on the scalar field that lives in the bulk . we have also shown that the brane undergoes a late - time acceleration epoch .",
    "the authors are grateful to k.  e.  kunze and m.  a.  vzquez - mozo for helpful comments .",
    "mbl is supported by the portuguese agency fundao para a cincia e tecnologia through the fellowship sfrh / bpd/26542/2006 .",
    "in this appendix we prove the existence of a mimicry of crossing the phantom divide modelled through the brane tension . for the proof it is useful to introduce the following dimensionless quantities @xmath120 in terms of these new variables , the constraint given in eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) reads @xmath121    if @xmath122 ; i.e. if we assume that the cdm energy density ( proportional to @xmath123 ) dominates at early time over the vacuum term ( the term @xmath124 is due to the bulk scalar field ) then it can be shown that the brane tension scales at that epoch as @xmath125 the same asymptotic behaviour is found for @xmath126 @xmath127 being the subleading term different .",
    "furthermore , if we assume in addition that the parameter @xmath128 ; i.e. cdm redshifts faster than in the 4d standard relativistic case , then the brane tension is negative at early times and it is an increasing function of the scale factor ( cf .",
    "eqs.([asymlambda11 ] ) and ( [ asymlambda12 ] ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , the condition @xmath122 implies also that the vacuum term due to the scalar field will dominate over the cdm term at late - time and it can be proven that at large values of @xmath76 ( or equivalently large values of the scale factor ) @xmath129 the constant @xmath130 is positive because for the vacuum solution the brane tension is always positive @xcite . again , if @xmath126 it can be proven that the asymptotic behaviour of the dimensionless tension @xmath131 for @xmath132 is the same as for @xmath133 given in eq .",
    "( [ asymlambda21 ] ) .",
    "therefore , at very late - time the brane tension decreases as the brane expands ( see eq .",
    "( [ asymlambda21 ] ) ) .    now ,",
    "since ( i ) @xmath131 is negative and an increasing function of @xmath76 at @xmath134 , and ( ii ) @xmath131 is a positive valued , decreasing function of @xmath76 at @xmath135 , then the brane tension must have at least a local positive maximum ( we remind the reader that the brane tension is a smooth analytical function of @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is precisely at this maximum that the mimicry of crossing the phantom divide takes place .",
    "one can go a step further and ask the following question : is there a local minimum such that @xmath136 , and @xmath70 ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "this can be proven using a _ reductio ad absurdum_. we start assuming the existence of a local minimum of @xmath131 at @xmath137 then at the minimum @xmath138e^{-\\beta_0x_0}}{2\\left[1-\\beta_0\\beta_1(1-\\beta_2)e^{-\\beta_0x_0}\\right ] } \\label{2deriv}\\ ] ] the denominator of the previous equation is positive because @xmath128 . on the other hand ,",
    "( i ) as the expression @xmath139e^{-\\beta_0x_0}<0,\\ ] ] because we have assumed @xmath140 , and ( ii ) the expression @xmath141 because the square of the hubble parameter is positive at @xmath137 and @xmath142 , then it turns out that the second derivative given in eq .",
    "( [ 2deriv ] ) is negative ; i.e. at @xmath137 the dimensionless brane tension has no local minimum .    therefore , under these conditions ; @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we know that the local maximum whose existence we have just proven is the unique extremum of @xmath131",
