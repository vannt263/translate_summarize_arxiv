    "dynamics of planar maps has drawn the attention of many authors .",

    "the latter conjectures results on global stability from local stability of the fixed point under some additional condition on the jacobian matrix .",
    "results in @xcite guarantee the global stability of the unique fixed point resorting to local conditions and the existence of an invariant embedded curve joining the fixed point to infinity .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this problem has been addressed exclusively in a non - symmetric context .",
    "however the existence of the invariant curve in @xcite made it seem natural to approach this problem in a symmetric setting , where invariant spaces for the dynamics are a key feature . in this context , we address the global dynamics of planar diffeomorphisms having a unique fixed point which is hyperbolic .",
    "we restrict our attention to the cases where the fixed point is either an attractor or a repellor .",
    "the case of a saddle point does not rely so much on symmetry .",
    "it will therefore be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the issue of uniqueness of a fixed point has been addressed by alarcn _",
    "et al _ @xcite who gave simple conditions for planar maps under which the origin is the unique fixed point .",
    "the presence of symmetry constrains the admissible local dynamics near the fixed point .",
    "we extend , whenever possible , the local dynamics to the whole plane using the properties determined by the symmetry .",
    "the reader may see that , in the case of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , local dynamics determines global dynamics .",
    "however , @xmath6 and @xmath7 symmetry do not provide any extra information on how to go from local to global dynamics .",
    "actually , for @xmath7 , we have constructed examples where more than one configuration can occur .",
    "for instance , in the case of a local attractor , the global dynamics may exhibit either several periodic points @xcite or a globally attracting set with special properties @xcite .",
    "for @xmath6 the dynamics is determined by a one - dimensional map .",
    "these situations provide a comprehensive description of the possible global dynamics .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we transcribe preliminary results concerning dynamics of planar maps and equivariance .",
    "these are organised in two subsections , the first on topological dynamics and the second on equivariance .",
    "the reader familiar with the subject may skip them without loss .",
    "section  [ seclocalglobal ] shows how local results can be extended to global results .",
    "we thus establish all possible dynamics in the presence of symmetry .",
