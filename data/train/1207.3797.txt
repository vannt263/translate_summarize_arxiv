    "the apogee project ( * ? ? ? * majewski et al .  in preparation ) uses a custom - built , cryogenic spectrograph @xcite recording 300 simultaneous near - ir spectra ( 1.511.70@xmath4 m ) fed from the sloan 2.5-m telescope @xcite .",
    "the final configuration for the spectrograph is described in wilson et al .",
    "( in preparation ) ; however , the data described here were taken before the instrument was in its fully commissioned state and in optimal focus ( achieved september 2011 ) .",
    "the net effect was a somewhat blurred line - spread - function , yielding a degradation of the resolution primarily in the red detector to @xmath1616,000 ( 1.651.70@xmath4 m ) compared to @xmath17 in the other two detectors ( 1.511.58@xmath4 m and 1.591.64@xmath4 m ) .",
    "the apogee fibers are plugged into standard sloan 2.5-m plugplates and observed similarly to those of the optical sloan spectrographs , with the following variations : ( 1 ) 35 fibers in each plugplate configuration collect sky spectra , ( 2 ) another 35 fibers are placed on bright , hot stars to gauge telluric ( co@xmath18 , h@xmath18o , and ch@xmath19 ) absorption , and ( 3 ) because the large zenith distances required to observe the bulge from apo cause strong differential refraction , the field diameter was restricted to 1@xmath20for @xmath21@xmath2212@xmath20fields ( 2@xmath20for the rest ) .",
    "we observed 18 bulge fields in june ",
    "july 2011 with @xmath6@xmath7 , @xmath8@xmath20and @xmath9@xmath20(see fig .",

    "the dereddened hess diagram for all observed stars is shown in figure [ fig_mapcmd]b . each field",
    "was observed for a total integration of roughly one hour , for a @xmath2@xmath3100 per apogee pixel for each star .",

    "the median rv scatter for stars observed multiple times is 0.22 ( with a mode of @xmath00.09 ) , while tests of derived rvs for observations of 53 stars in three globular clusters ( m3 , m13 , m15 ) with accurate literature rvs suggest that the zeropoint of the apogee pipeline rvs is accurate to @xmath00.26@xmath260.22 km s@xmath27 .",
    "the bulge rv distributions exhibit a significant ( and unexpected ) number of high - velocity stars , which appear as prominent high - velocity peaks in eight fields and as high - velocity `` shoulders '' to the main peak in many of the other fields .",
    "we focus on the rv distributions of the eight apogee bulge fields with distinct high - velocity peaks , shown in figure [ fig_rvhist2 ] with a @xmath23 selection .",
    "the stars in the high - rv peak account for @xmath010% of the stars in a field . to derive the mean velocity of the high - velocity component ,",
    "the histograms are fitted with a two - gaussian model  a hot component for the bulge and a colder component for the high - velocity stars . and [ 5.7,-2.0 ] ) , but they serve well to estimate the peak center . ]",
    "these high - velocity peaks have not been previously detected in the mw bulge , including in the extensive brava data ( @xmath28@xmath29 , @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32 ; * ? ? ?",
    "several narrow peaks in the rv histogram were detected in the brava data @xcite but were eventually determined to be due to stochastic effects .",
    "our high - velocity peaks are unlikely to be due to stochastic effects because : ( 1 ) our sample per field is large ( twice that of brava ) , ( 2 ) the high - velocity peaks are seen in at least eight apogee fields , ( 3 ) the peaks appear at similar rvs following a general trend with longitude ( fig .  [",
    "fig_simrvtrend]a ) , and ( 4 ) the pattern is `` mirrored '' across the midplane ( e.g. , strong similarities between @xmath21,@xmath33=10,@xmath262 ) . we conclude that the high - velocity peaks are due to real motions of stars in the galaxy .",
    "table [ table_rv ] gives the field name , longitude , latitude , diameter , mean @xmath34and velocity dispersion of all stars , number of stars , mean @xmath34of the high - velocity stars , the high - velocity threshold ( essentially the velocity of the `` trough '' between the main and high - velocity peaks ) , and the number of high - velocity stars in the eight apogee bulge fields that exhibit the most distinct high - velocity peaks . to ascertain the nature of the high - velocity stars , we compare the apogee rv histograms to several models .",
    "the besanon galaxy model ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * hereafter bgm ) simulates the stellar content in any given line of sight and computes the photometry , kinematics , and metallicity of each simulated star . for each population ( thin disk , thick disk , halo , bar , and bulge ) , a star formation rate history , age , and initial mass function",
    "are assumed , allowing the model to generate the distribution function of absolute magnitude , effective temperature , and age of the stars .",
    "density functions are assumed for each population and tested against observations using photometric star counts .",
    "the model also includes a 3d extinction map @xcite and simulated uncertainties on the observational parameters of each star .",
    "the bgm bar and bulge populations are described in @xcite .",
    "the bar is the more massive component and dominates the stellar content at low latitudes , while the bulge is longer and thicker and gives a contribution at intermediate latitudes where the bar becomes less prominent .",
    "the bar kinematics are taken from the @xcite dynamical model , and the bulge kinematics are established to reproduce the brava survey data ( robin et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "this multi - population model also explains well the presence of double red clumps at medium latitudes @xcite that are created by stars trapped in vertical resonances associated with the bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lifting them to high altitudes .",
    "we also compare to the @xmath13-body model of @xcite , which represents a mw ",
    "sized galaxy with initial disk scale - height of 200 pc .",
    "the model was subjected to a cosmologically - motivated satellite accretion history and formed a bar as a consequence of the accretion events .",
    "the properties of the bar are similar to those of the mw bar ( in overall orientation and size ) .      the model developed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mvg ) is an @xmath13-body galaxy based on secular evolution of disk galaxies through angular momentum transfer between disk and halo .",
    "once the bar appears , it grows stronger and buckles , forming a boxy bulge , such as the one seen in the mw .",
    "after this buckling the bar weakens and resumes growth by giving angular momentum to the live dark matter halo . at this point",
    "the bar has a short , thick component and longer , thinner component .",
    "this model has already been quantitatively compared with the innermost region of the mw ( @xmath32@xmath35 ; * ? ? ? * ) and also in the outer bar @xcite with good agreement .",
    "figure [ fig_rvcomparisons ] compares the observed apogee rv histograms ( black solid lines and shaded region ) to the above models .",
    "the blue line shows one `` observation '' of the bgm , selected using the simulated photometric information and apogee targeting algorithms with model photometric errors and no reddening .",
    "the bgm reproduces the main features of most fields quite well , but not the high - velocity peak .",
    "multiple simulated observations of the bgm were performed and found to be very similar , indicating that stochastic effects were small .",
    "only one observation is shown for clarity .",
    "the rv histograms of the kazantzidis model are shown in green .",
    "this model can not be mock `` observed '' like the bgm because synthetic photometry is not available .",
    "the rv distributions are a fairly good representation of the apogee histograms , but sometimes show a poorer match to the main rv peak , compared to the bgm .",
    "this model does show significantly more stars at high velocity and roughly match the fraction and distribution trend ( decreasing number to even higher velocities ) observed in the apogee data .",
    "however , it does not reproduce the `` trough '' between the main and high - velocity peaks seen in the apogee data .    the mvg model ( red ) , as with the kazantzidis models , reproduces the high - velocity stars much better than the bgm , although often `` over - predicting '' them .",
    "as in the kazantzidis model , the mvg high - velocity stars are in the bar .",
    "this model also shows the interpeak `` trough '' in some of the fields ( e.g. , [ 14.0,@xmath362.0 ] , [ 6.0,0.0 ] , [ 4.0,0.0 ] ) .",
    "the leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) data @xcite , shown as a dotted black line , display high - velocity peaks in some of the fields , but often at an rv different from the apogee peaks .",

    "it predicts very few sgr particles in our fields and at rvs quite different from the apogee high - velocity peaks .",
    "we detect high - velocity peaks in our apogee bulge rv distributions previously undetected in the data of brava or any other survey ; this might be due to the different regions sampled by the surveys ( i.e. , apogee probing lower @xmath38 ) .",
    "we compare our stellar data to various models and data to discern the nature of this newly found `` stellar population '' of the bulge .",
    "one potential explanation of this rv feature is that these stars are part of the tidal tail of sgr , which lies close to the apogee bulge fields and has a mean velocity of @xmath11@xmath0 + 170 at these longitudes @xcite .",
    "however , initial distance estimates ( using preliminary apogee stellar parameters and girardi et al .",
    "2002 isochrones ) of @xmath0510 kpc for the apogee stars ( also see isochrones in fig .  [",
    "fig_mapcmd]b ) make this explanation unlikely , because sgr and its tidal tails are @xmath029 kpc distant @xcite . in addition , the @xcite model predicts very few high - velocity sgr tidal tail stars in our fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rvcomparisons ] ) .",
    "could these stars be a new substructure in the mw halo ?",
    "we find this explanation unlikely because ( 1 ) the distribution of high - velocity stars in the dereddened cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mapcmd]b ) is almost identical to the rest of the stars in our fields ( which should be dominated by the bulge / bar ) , with rough distances of @xmath0510 kpc , whereas a halo substructure should be more tightly clumped around one distance and metallicity ; ( 2 ) the high - velocity stars constitute a large fraction ( @xmath010% ) of stars in the apogee fields , which is much larger than would be expected for halo substructure ; and ( 3 ) the high - velocity stars are detected in many fields covering a large range of longitude , which would imply a truly enormous structure .",
    "we therefore conclude that the high - rv stars are most likely members of the bar / bulge .",
    "stars at these velocities and in comparable proportions of the total stellar population are predicted by the kazantzidis and mvg @xmath13-body models ; isolation and examination of these high - rv particles in the models reveal their membership in the galactic bar .",
    "furthermore , these model particles are grouped together on the `` far '' side ( leading edge ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_simrvtrend]b ) of the bar , suggesting a coherent spatial / dynamical feature , rather than a sampling of stars with coincidentally similar velocities but on intrinsically unassociated orbits .",
    "( the lack of high - rv stars in the besanon model may simply be due to their use of highly - smoothed kinematical prescriptions . )    the nature and significance of the trough at intermediate velocities ( @xmath11@xmath0140180 ) is not clear .",
    "we have isolated the @xmath13-body particles occupying the rv trough but could not identify any group property , such as large distance , that would preferentially remove the corresponding stars from the apogee sample .",
    "it is possible that rather than an intrinsic trough ( or drop in stellar surface density ) , the distribution is caused by an enhancement in phase space at high - velocity from the combination of stars piling up at certain phases of their orbit ( e.g. , apogalacticon , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and projection effects .",
    "this explanation is supported by the structure seen in the fluid - dynamical model of @xcite . in their figures 6 and 8 ,",
    "a concentration of high - rv gas exists on the leading edge of the bar , with velocities and galactic positions consistent with the high - rv particles `` observed '' in the kazantzidis and mvg models .",
    "this concentration would correspond spatially with stars on x@xmath18 orbits in the bar , perpendicular to the bar s major axis . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed rv trough simply reflects the low count of stars at high rvs that are not in this dense dynamical structure . why this property is not reproduced in the @xmath13-body models",
    "may be due to the resolution of the stellar structures contained within the model or the stellar density laws governing them .",
    "the weight of evidence therefore suggests that the best explanation for the high - velocity stars is that they are members of the mw bar , grouped on particular orbits or phases of their orbit .",
    "the @xmath13-body models predict that high _ negative _ velocity stars should be seen at symmetrical longitudes in the fourth quadrant .",
    "additional apogee data , follow - up data in the fourth quadrant , and future , more detailed model comparisons will yield insight into the nature of these features .",
