    "the interaction between solid bodies and vortices is important in many areas of biology , physics , and engineering . in this work",
    "we study a fundamental interaction between a vortex and a simple passive body  a flexible filament .",
    "we consider a point vortex in a purely inviscid flow .",
    "the filament has uniform bending stiffness ( with values given in the video frames ) , is clamped at its left end , and is free at its right end .",
    "the first sequence shows the motion of a point vortex around a nearly rigid filament .",
    "the green circle is centered at the location of the point vortex and the filament is the black line .",
    "the trajectory , shown by the light green line , is nearly periodic . in subsequent clips",
    ", we decrease the filament bending stiffness and show the dynamics . in general",
    ", the filament is attracted to the vortex , leading to a finite - time collision , with distance tending to zero as the square root of temporal displacement from the collision time .",
    "for some values of bending stiffness , we show dynamics for different initial positions . in some clips , we also show a second view at the bottom , which zooms in on the region of the filament near the vortex ."
