    "the study of the gravitational loss - cone instability , a far analog of the plasma cone instability , has begun with the work of v. polyachenko ( 1991 ) , in which a simplest analytical model of thin disk stellar cluster has been treated .",
    "the interest to the problem of stability of stellar clusters has been revived recently by detailed investigation by tremaine ( 2005 ) and polyachenko , polyachenko , shukhman , ( 2007 ; henceforth , paper i ) of low mass clusters around massive black holes .",
    "the both papers have considered stability of small amplitude perturbations of stellar clusters of disk - like and spherical geometry .",
    "tremaine ( 2005 ) has shown using goodman s ( 1988 ) criterion that thin disks with symmetric dfs over angular momentum and empty loss cone are generally unstable .",
    "by contrast , analyzing perturbations with spherical numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , he deduced that spherical clusters with monotonically increasing df of angular momentum should be generally stable .",
    "later we demonstrated ( see paper i ) that spherical systems with non - monotonic distributions may be unstable for sufficiently small - scale perturbations @xmath2 , while the harmonics @xmath3 are always stable .",
    "for the sake of convenience , we have used two assumptions .",
    "the first one is that the keplerian potential of the massive black hole dominates over a self - gravitating potential of the stellar cluster ( which does not mean that one can neglect the latter ) .",
    "then the characteristic time of system evolution is of the order of the orbit precessing time , which is slow , compared to typical dynamical ( free fall ) time .",
    "since a star makes many revolutions in its almost unaltered orbit , we can regard it as to be `` smeared out '' along the orbit in accordance with passing time , and study evolution of systems made of these extended objects .",
    "the second assumption is a so called _ spoke approximation _ ,",
    "in which a system consists of near - radial orbits only .",
    "this approximation was earlier suggested by one of the authors ( polyachenko 1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "the spoke approximation reduces the problem to a study of rather simple analytical characteristic equations controlling small perturbations of stellar clusters .",
    "there are two questions that naturally arise in this context .",
    "first : does the instability remain when abandoning the assumption of strong radial elongation of orbits ?",
    "second : does the instability occur in spheres with monotonically increasing distributions in angular momentum if one consider smaller - scale perturbations with @xmath4 ?",
    "the aim of the paper is to provide answers to these questions .    to achieve the task we use semi - analytical approach based on analysis of integral equations for slow modes elaborated recently in polyachenko ( 2004 , 2005 ) for thin disks , and in paper i for spherical geometry .",
    "following paper i , we shall restrict ourselves to studying monoenergetic models with dfs in the form @xmath5 the models specified by function @xmath6 are suitable for studying the effects of angular momentum distribution on gravitational loss - cone instability .",
    "on the other hand , the dirac @xmath7-function permits one to reduce the integral equations for slow modes to one - dimensional integral equations , and to advance substantially in analytical calculations .",
    "several arguments can be brought in favour of our simplified approach .",
    "first of all , the lynden - bell derivative ( see paper i , eq .",
    "4.7 ) of the df with respect to angular momentum @xmath8 , keeping @xmath9 constant ( here @xmath10 is the radial action ) in the limit where the slow mode approximation is applicable , can be replaced by a derivative , keeping energy @xmath11 constant : @xmath12 because @xmath13 is small .",
    "thus , the derivative over energy is not included into the slow integral equation , and one can loosely say , that dependence on energy is only parametric . another argument is that the results of independent study by tremaine ( 2005 ) , who used a non - monoenergetic df , are in agreement with our conclusions .",
    "section 2 is devoted to spheres , section 3  to thin disks with symmetric dfs .",
    "the sections are organized alike . in the beginning",
    "we derive integral equations for initial distribution functions in the form ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) . then follow analytical and numerical investigations of these equations .",
    "we demonstrate that by contrast to the case of near - keplerian sphere , the loss - cone instability in disks takes place even for the monotonic df , @xmath14 , provided the precession is retrograde and the loss cone is empty : @xmath15 .",
    "2 is complimented by stability analysis of models with circular orbits , which of course does nt belong to the class of monoenergetic models of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) type .    in the last , section 4",
    ", we discuss the results and some perspectives of further studies .",
    "for the near - keplerian systems , the slow integral equation , which has been derived in our paper i ( see there eq .",
    "( 4.8 ) ) , is neatly suited .",
    "in contrast to paper i , we shall not assume here strong elongation of orbits , i.e. we shall go beyond the spoke approximation .",
    "since energies of all stars are identical , the unperturbed df depends on one variable only .",
    "it is convenient to use a dimensionless angular momentum @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angular momentum on circular orbits : @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the central point mass , @xmath20 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the frequency of stellar radial oscillations @xmath21 , and the radius of the system @xmath22 are independent of the angular momentum . for shorthand notations , we shall omit the argument @xmath23 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath24 is taken so that a mass of the spherical system surrounding the central mass is equal to @xmath25 ( we assume the ratio @xmath26 to be small : @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 if one defines the normalization of the dimensionless df over angular momentum @xmath29 ( see ( 1.1 ) ) as @xmath30 , then normalization factor @xmath24 in ( 1.1 ) is @xmath31 it allows to represent the kernel of the integral equation ( formula ( 4.8 ) in the paper i ) in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the index of the spherical harmonic , @xmath34 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath35 is the bessel function .",
    "the coefficient @xmath36 can be calculated analytically : @xmath37 .",
    "numerical calculations show decreasing @xmath38 with increasing the mode number @xmath33 : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and so on . ]",
    "the functions @xmath43 satisfy to the condition @xmath44 ; their explicit form is given later .",
    "then substitution of the df in the form ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) leads to the following integral equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fourier harmonics of the radial part of the perturbed potential ( for more detail , see paper i ) , @xmath47 is the orbital precession rate , @xmath48 for odd @xmath33 , and @xmath49 for even @xmath33 .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    recall that eq .",
    "( [ eq:1s.1 ] ) is written in a noninertial reference frame centered on the mass @xmath19 .",
    "then , additional indirect potential arising from the acceleration of the frame should be considered ( see , e.g. , tremain 2005 ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the perturbation to the background df .",
    "tremain ( 2005 ) argued that for the secular perturbations , this indirect potential must be omitted .",
    "indeed , in studying secular evolution one should consider perturbations @xmath53 averaged over keplerian orbits .",
    "in this case the perturbed density is a superposition of contributions of individual orbits , averaged over their periods .",
    "a special feature of a keplerian orbit is that the average force from this orbit acting to the material point located in a focus of the ellipse is equal to zero .",
    "one must be careful however , since the perturbation is not well defined for orbits with low angular momenta .",
    "below we shall consider systems with `` small amount '' of stars with low angular momenta only ( see also discussion in sec .",

    "the expression for the precession rate can be obtained by transformation of expression ( 4.2 ) of tremaine ( 2005 ) ( see also paper i ) : @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where the density @xmath80 is defined by ( [ eq:1s.10 ] ) .    for the monoenergetic models ,",
    "the minimal and maximal radii are @xmath81 where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the minimal dimensionless angular momentum corresponding to the boundary of the loss cone .",

    "tremaine ( 2005 ) has noted that for an arbitrary distribution @xmath98 with empty loss cone , @xmath99 , a zero frequency lopsided mode @xmath0 must exist .",
    "the mode corresponds to a non - trivial perturbation arising under shift of the spherical system as a whole relative to the central mass .",
    "the perturbed potential in such a mode is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the displacement . in terms of the function @xmath102 ,",

    ", it defies common sense to argue that the stationary mode in which the center of mass of a spherical system does not coincide with the bh is physical .",
    "indeed , it seems that movement ( oscillations ) of the stellar cluster and the bh relative to the common center of mass must occur .",
    "however , it does not occur .",
    "it is , by all means , clear in the case of the empty loss cone of finite size , @xmath111 ( here @xmath83 is a minimal value of dimensionless angular momentum @xmath112 , for which @xmath113 ) .",
    "indeed , let us consider the spherically symmetric cluster .",
    "since the loss cone is finite , there is a spherical empty cavity of finite radius in the centre of sphere .",
    "according to the newton s first theorem ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , in this cavity the bh does not experience a net gravitational force from the cluster .",
    "thus , if the bh is initially deposited at some arbitrary point within the cavity , it would remain at this position ( and hence , acceleration of stellar cluster due to non - coincidence of centers of mass does not occur ) .    in the case",
    "when @xmath114 the situation is not so obvious , but the net force acting to the bh from the shifted spherical system can be zero as well . in order to assure this ,",
    "one should write down the indirect potential taking into account the expression for perturbed density in zero lopsided mode @xmath115 : @xmath116 @xmath117 hence , the condition for omitting of the indirect potential is @xmath118 . in what follows",
    "we suppose this condition to be fulfilled .",
    "the conditon is not equivalent to the condition @xmath119 , imposed to the df for the existence of such a solution of our governing integral equation , but it is equivalent to the stronger condition : @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that if @xmath121 for small @xmath112 then @xmath122 for small @xmath68 .",
    "so , the condition @xmath123 must be fulfilled .    by contrast , in the disk systems the analogous @xmath124 zero mode does not exist , because there is no analog of the newton s first theorem .",
    "the very existence of zero modes is crucial for stability analysis of spherical clusters with monotonic distributions .",
    "indeed , the role of destabilizing contribution of the second term in the right side of ( [ eq:1s.3 ] ) falls off with increasing the number @xmath33 .",
    "so , it is expected that the most `` dangerous '' modes correspond to the lowest values of @xmath33 .",
    "but it turns out that @xmath0 mode is neutrally stable , and the next dangerous mode @xmath1 is stable .",
    "note , however , that such a reasoning is not valid for systems with non - monotonic distributions .      by analyzing ( [ eq:1s.3 ] ) , it is easy to find one more analytical solution with the frequency @xmath125 at arbitrary values of @xmath33 , for the models with highly elongated orbits .",
    "first of all we note that the frequency of this stable mode corresponds to the resonance on the _ tail _ of a narrow distribution , and so it decays exponentially slowly .",
    "in this way the mode differs from the unstable modes of interest which have a resonance in a region where the distribution is localized , i.e. at @xmath126 ; so they have characteristic frequencies and growth rates of the order of @xmath127 .    after setting @xmath128 in ( [ eq:1s.3 ] ) , omitting the second summand in l.h.s . , turning to the spoke approximation , and taking into account the equality @xmath129 , one finds @xmath130 it is essential that this _ high - frequency _ mode is independent of details of the df .",
    "note also that in the systems with prograde precession , this mode describes the well - known radial orbit instability ( instead of the neutral oscillations ) .      using ( [ eq:1s.3 ] )",
    ", one can prove two important statements :    1 .",
    "for spherical system models with monotonic distributions @xmath131 , the eigenfrequency squared , @xmath132 , must be a real number .",
    "this means that either the instability is absent at all , or aperiodic instability with @xmath133 occurs .",
    "2 .   rotating ( or oscillating ) unstable modes may appear only in models with non - monotonic distributions .",
    "let us write eq .",
    "( [ eq:1s.3 ] ) in the form @xmath134 where @xmath135 we multiply both parts of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.1 ] ) by @xmath136 , sum the result over @xmath137 ( asterisk means the complex conjugation ) , and integrate over @xmath112 with the weight @xmath138 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath139 \\,[g(\\alpha')\\,\\varphi_{s'}(\\alpha')].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the reality of the coefficients of @xmath140 in the l.h.s . of ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) and the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "is evident . with the help of ( [ eq:1s.7 ] )",
    ", one can show that the kernel in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) has the following property of symmetry : @xmath141",
    "so , one can readily see that the second term in the r.h.s is real also .",
    "consequently , taking the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath142    > from the last equality , the statements formulated above follow immediately . if the function @xmath138 ( or , equivalently , @xmath143 ) is constant - sign , then the integral should be non - zero , and so @xmath144 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath145 , the integral must be equal to zero . consequently , the function @xmath138 should change its sign , i.e. df @xmath131 is non - monotonic .",
    "let us explain the term _ variational principle _ used in the title of this subsection .",
    "consider a dynamic equation in the form @xmath146 .",
    "provided that `` elasticity operator '' @xmath147 is hermitian , the dynamic equation may be obtained from the conditions @xmath148 and @xmath149 . here",
    "@xmath150 and @xmath151 are considered formally as independent variations while the functional @xmath152 is @xmath153 ( @xmath154 is a nonnegative weight function ) .",
    "in such a case it is used to speak about the variational ( or energy ) principle ( see , e.g. , review by kadomtsev 1966 on mhd - stability of plasma ) . from the other hand",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath155 for any nontrivial @xmath101 then @xmath152 is real .",
    "thus usually ( as is the case in mhd - stability theory of plasma where @xmath147 is hermitian and @xmath156 ) the notions `` variational principle '' and reality of @xmath152 are identical . however , in our case the condition latexmath:[$\\int",
    "@xmath101 unless the df is monotonic .",
    "assuming that this condition is fulfilled , following the tradition that originates from plasma physics we speak that the variational principle takes place . only in this case",
    "the dynamical equation can be interpreted mechanically , in terms of elastic forces .",
    "evidently , the condition ( [ eq:4.4 ] ) is a serious obstacle to obtain unstable rotating modes .",
    "so , one might want to get round this obstacle .",
    "for instance , if we slightly change the initial monotonically increasing df in a narrow region near @xmath158 , to vanish quickly but smoothly , then a modified system would be practically indistinguishable from the initial one .",
    "but then the variational principle breaks down .",
    "the question can be formulated as follows : may the discontinuous vanishing of @xmath131 at @xmath158 be considered as the violation of monotony for the df ?",
    "importance of this question is known since stability study of stellar systems with isotropic dfs , @xmath159 ( antonov , 1960 , 1962 ) .",
    "the variational principle there required a df to be decreasing function of energy @xmath11 , @xmath160 , everywhere .",
    "the systems with @xmath161 need separate examinations , that was carried out in some cases ( see , e.g. , antonov , 1971 , kalnajs , 1972 , polyachenko and shukhman , 1972 , 1973 , fridman and polyachenko , 1984 ) .",
    "an essential difference of the second type of dfs is in jumps to zero at the phase space boundary @xmath162 .",
    "in fact , we have in this case an interval degenerated into the single point @xmath162 where @xmath163 is decreasing .",
    "we checked numerically a possibility of the instability development connected with the maximum on the edge of the distribution function s domain .",
    "for this purpose , number of models smoothed near @xmath158 were computed .",
    "the computations showed no sign of instability , in contrast to isotropic distributions , @xmath159 .",
    "the reason for the tolerance of our present models is in fact that the kernels @xmath164 of integral operators in ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) vanish for the circular orbit @xmath158 , so details of the initial distribution near circular orbits can not affect much solutions of the integral equation ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) .",
    "roles of different terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.1 ] ) can be easily understood . when @xmath165 , the first term of the right side in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.1 ] ) favors stabilization , while the second term gives destabilization ( taking into account that the operator involved into this construction is self - adjoint and positively defined ) . in principle",
    ", this destabilizing effect could lead to instability .",
    "however , this is not the case because the stabilizing contribution exceeds destabilizing one in all cases considered both by tremaine ( 2005 ) , and in the present paper ( see the following sections ) .",

    "tremaine ( 2005 ) has also obtained a sufficient condition for a lopsided mode in the symmetrical disk using goodman s ( 1988 ) criterion .",
    "his condition , however , differs from ours .",
    "namely : if the loss cone is empty , @xmath99 , and @xmath456 throughout the radial range containing most of the disk mass , then disk is unstable with respect to @xmath124 perturbations .",
    "this formulation does not use the requirement for precession to be retrograde and the df to be monotonically increasing , although monotonic increase of @xmath457_{l=0}=0 $ ] , @xmath458_{l=0}>0 $ ] is implied , at least for small angular momentum .",
    "thus , the comparison between spherical and disk case can hardly be made , unless the conditions of stability is formulated in similar terms . to perform the comparison ,",
    "we give our own criterion that follows directly from the integral equation .",
    "it needs to be emphasized that the sufficient condition by tremaine ( 2005 ) is different .",
    "lack of the condition for the sign of precession possibly means that his criterion include two type of instability simultaneously   the radial orbit instability arising in disks with prograde precession , and the loss cone instability which require retrograde precession .    for disks composed of near - radial orbits ,",
    "tremaine s condition gives the result obtained in paper i : a disk with symmetrical distribution @xmath131 obeying the conditions @xmath432 , @xmath433 is unstable if the precession is retrograde . in turn ,",
    "precession of near - radial orbits is retrograde if @xmath456 .      to support the mathematical rationale given above and to provide a basis for possible simulations , it is useful to obtain eigenfrequencies of unstable modes for particular models .",
    "here we consider the _ power  exp _ model with symmetrical distribution @xmath459 where the normalization constant is @xmath460 for @xmath172 the constant @xmath461 .",
    "distributions become monotonic in the interval @xmath462 $ ] when @xmath463 . note , that when @xmath464 df is simply @xmath465 in the interval @xmath466 $ ] and does nt depend on @xmath169 .",
    "evaluation of integral equation ( [ eq : disk.4s ] ) requires preliminary calculations of the kernel function @xmath467 using ( [ eq : disk.5 ] ) , and the scaled precession rate @xmath66 using ( [ eq : disk 3.17 ] ) and ( [ eq : disk 3.19 ] ) . for brevity , we skip the details here , just noting that calculation of function @xmath468 is turn out to be rather difficult numerical task .",
    "the calculations show that for the model ( [ eq : disk_4.1 ] ) the precession rate @xmath66 is retrograde for all @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath416 .    the results for values of azimuthal number @xmath469 are collected in fig.[fig:6 ] . since the initial distribution is symmetric , real parts of the eigenvalues @xmath293 are equal to zero . hence in fig.[fig:6 ] we show the imaginary parts @xmath470 , which are the growth rates of the unstable modes divided by azimuthal number @xmath471 , vs. dimensionless angular momentum dispersion @xmath169 .",
    "one can see that instability exists for all @xmath169 and never becomes saturated .",
    "moreover , it is easy to obtain the asymptotic values @xmath472 for different @xmath471 at @xmath473 : 0.289 , 0.108 , and 0.026 for @xmath469 correspondingly . for small angular momentum ,",

    "we have studied the stability of the spherically - symmetric and thin disk stellar clusters around a massive black hole .",
    "we conclude that stability properties of spherical clusters depend crucially on monotonity of initial distribution functions , while thin disk clusters are almost always unstable .",
    "if the initial distribution of the spherical cluster is monotonic , the cluster is most likely to be stable .",
    "this conclusion was first made in tremaine ( 2005 ) , where stability of @xmath0 mode was generally proved , and @xmath1 was tested numerically .",
    "we confirm this conclusion by considering a number of monotonic distributions for modes with arbitrary @xmath33 .",
    "besides , we have checked distributions obtained from monotonic ones by making them vanish quickly but smoothly at circular orbits .",
    "these models were also stable .",
    "however , a general proof of stability for any monotonic distributions was not yet found .",
    "spherical clusters with the non - monotonic dfs should be generally affected by the gravitational loss - cone instability .",
    "the instability was first found in our paper i using a simplification of systems with near - radial orbits . in the sec .",
    "2 we show that this instability is due to just non - monotony of distributions over angular momentum , the orbits may not necessary be near - radial .    in our opinion , both monotonic and non - monotonic distributions are important for possible applications to real stellar clusters around black holes .",
    "the dfs monotonically increasing from the loss cone radius up to circular orbits are formed naturally due to two - body collisions of stars .",
    "it follows from numerical experiments ( see , e.g. , cohn and kulsrud , 1978 ) , which predict establishment of such distributions after a characteristic time for collisional relaxation .",
    "these distributions may be approximated by the formula @xmath477 .",
    "such a slowly increasing function is , in fact , predetermined by the boundary conditions imposed in the cited numerical study and some other investigations .",
    "indeed , the vanishing condition at @xmath478 , and the matching condition to isotropic ( maxwellian ) distribution , @xmath159 , at the boundary @xmath479 of the phase space @xmath480 ( boundary separates stars which is gravitationally coupled to the black hole from the others ) is required .",
    "the last condition means the asymptotic ( when @xmath481 ) independence of the function @xmath98 on the momentum @xmath8 .",
    "so monotonic , or logarithmic , dependence of type of ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) is quite reasonable .",
    "the non - monotonic distributions are also real .",
    "if the cluster , is formed , for example , as a result of the collisionless collapse ( several free fall times ) , then it remains collisionless for a long timescale of collisional relaxation ( see , e.g. , merritt & wang , 2005 ) . in principle",
    ", the system can have almost arbitrary df both in the energy and in the angular momentum . during the collapse",
    ", a typical non - monotonic distribution of stars over the angular momentum , with empty loss cone and maximum at some value @xmath482 , is formed .",
    "in paper i we argued that stability properties of such a distribution is effectively analogous to one of typical plasma distributions of the `` beam - like '' type .",
    "but they can readily become unstable , as it is well - known in plasma physics ( and also confirmed by direct stability study of corresponding stellar systems in paper i ) .",
    "it is possible ( as it is often so in plasma ) that for the time of collisionless behavior , df can undergo a dramatic change from its initial form . in particular , the collective flux of stars into the loss cone caused by the instability could , in principle , lead to the formation of a considerable part of the black hole .",
    "checking of such possibilities is the most urgent task for future studies of unstable _ non - monotonic _ models .    since spherically - symmetric models with the _ monotonic _",
    "df are apparently stable , but analogous disk systems are unstable ( see tremaine 2005 and sec .",
    "3 ) , a critical flatness of ellipsoid models at which the instability begins is expected .",
    "study of such systems , as well as systems with more complex triaxial ellipsoids can be performed using numerical simulations .",
