    "we can most likely rule out supernova ( sn ) remnants as the cause of the x - ray emission ; there are no massive star - forming clusters coincident with the compact radio emission , rendering this scenario somewhat implausible , but not impossible .",
    "to more robustly constrain the nature of the compact central source in he 210 and to better constrain its mass , it is important to understand how its x - ray luminosity varies with time .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .    the original evidence for the agn in he 210 came in part from analysis of the spectrally hard , resolved point source in the 2001 _ chandra _  observations . here ,",
    "we analyze data taken from _ chandra _  ( 2001 ) , _ xmm - newton _  ( 2004 and 2011 ) , and _ asca _  ( 1997 ) to obtain spectra at each epoch and a resulting measure of the long - term variability of the hard nuclear source . the temporal baseline of the observations is sufficient to probe variability on timescales reasonable for an intermediate - mass bh or low - mass agn , as shown by the small known sampling of these rare objects @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the spectral extraction process for each observation , with a focus on details of the sophisticated background modeling , which was required for the _ xmm - newton _  and _ asca _  observations .",
    "all spectral analyses are performed using xspec v12.8.0 @xcite .",
    "see table  [ table : obs ] for the details of the observations .",
    "we will focus primarily on the more sensitive observations taken by _",
    "chandra _ in 2001 and _ xmm _ in 2004 and 2011 , but will also include a discussion of the 1997 _ asca _  observation that provides a ( less sensitive ) baseline measurement of the source flux . throughout the paper ,",
    "uncertainties on x - ray measurements ( fluxes , luminosities , and spectral parameters ) represent 90% confidence intervals .      the nuclear x - ray point source in he 210 was discovered in the 20 ks acis - s _ chandra _  observation of he 210 on 23 march 2001 @xcite .",
    "the pipeline - reduced data from this observation ( see figure [ fig : area ] ) were obtained from the heasarc public archive and were reduced using the analysis tools of ciao 4.5 .",
    "time filtering yielded 19.7 ks of cleaned exposure . for _ chandra _  we defined two separate source extraction regions : a small region of radius 2.25  at the nuclear region of the galaxy was used to measure the flux of the hard point source , and a larger region of radius 16.8  was used to include the soft diffuse x - ray component . in either case",
    ", the background region was comprised of an annulus of outer radius 58 arcsec , excluding the larger ( diffuse ) source region and another point source about 45 arcsec away from the source .",
    "we note that the background level above 2 kev in the _ chandra _ observation was much less prominent than in the _ xmm _  and _ asca _  observations .",
    "the spectrum , as well as the response and ancilliary files , were extracted using the specextract command .",
    "due to the high signal - to - noise ratio and low background , we used ciao s built - in background subtraction rather than simultaneously fitting source and background spectra , as for the _ xmm _  and _ asca _  observations .",
    "for all the observations presented in this paper , the source spectrum is described with a model consisting of the power - law component to model the hard nuclear source and optically - thin thermal ( vmekal ; @xcitex ) component to model the diffuse emission , with abundance values fixed to those obtained in @xcite ( 0.78 for light elements and 0.29 for heavy elements ) , and allowing the normalization and temperature to float .",
    "we use a vmekal to match the spectral analysis of @xcite , but note that fitting with an apec model @xcite has no significant effect on the results for the hard component .",
    "following @xcite , we include galactic absorption @xmath7 @xmath8 on all components , and local absorption for the vmekal component ( @xmath9 @xmath8 ) .",
    "the absorption on the power law component ( @xmath10 ) was allowed to float .",
    "absorption is computed using the tbabs model @xcite . in xspec notation ,",
    "the source model is given by :    @xmath11    we first fit this model to the spectrum from the nuclear ( 2.25  radius ) source region , to obtain the strongest possible constraint on the emission from the unresolved hard component .",
    "with relatively few counts at high energies we obtain poor constraints on the hard x - ray photon index , so this is fixed to the canonical agn value of @xmath12 .",
    "( repeating the fit for values of intrinsic @xmath13 varying within a range typical for agn , @xmath14 @xcite , produces no significant change in the unabsorbed flux . )",
    "the fit yields @xmath15 @xmath8 , indicating substantial absorption .",
    "we next fit the same model to the spectrum from the extended source region ( a circle centered on the nuclear region with 16.8  radius ) , but fix the @xmath16 value on the power law component to that obtained for the nuclear spectrum .",
    "we obtain a consistent and nearly identical flux for the hard power - law component between the extended and nuclear regions , but a substantially brighter diffuse ( vmekal ) component in the extended region , with best - fit @xmath17 kev .",
    "this confirms that for an even larger extraction region such as those used for _ xmm _  and _ asca _ , the hard spectral component can be associated with the compact nuclear source .",
    "the best - fit fluxes and spectral parameters are given in table [ table : params ] .",
    "we quote intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) fluxes and luminosities for the hard nuclear component , and observed ( absorbed ) fluxes for the soft diffuse component . for direct comparison with the _ xmm _ analysis , we have also extracted a _",
    "spectrum with somewhat larger radius of 36 , corresponding to the _ xmm _ source region described in the next section ( figure  [ fig : area ] ) . using this larger source region has no significant effect on the spectral parameters .",
    "we use two subsequent observations of he 210 by _ xmm _  to constrain the long - term variability of the source .",
    "the _ xmm _",
    "observations on 27 may 2004 and 11 may 2011 have exposure times of 42 and 27 ks , respectively . for both _ xmm _  observations , we reduced , cleaned , and extracted spectra from all three ccd cameras : pn , mos1 , and mos2 .",
    "after spectral extraction and analysis , the mos1 and mos2 data yielded significantly lower signal - to - noise ratios at energies @xmath182 kev compared to the pn detector , so that no useful constraints were obtained on the hard emission from the nuclear point source . in what follows we therefore focus on results from the pn .",
    "the source extraction regions were 36  in radius , chosen to provide a balance between extracting as many counts as possible from the source and minimizing the background .",
    "( as a check , we have repeated the analysis using a smaller source region of 25  radius , and obtain essentially identical results with marginally larger uncertainties . )",
    "the _ chandra _  images ( figure  [ fig : area ] ) show that the extent of both the nuclear and diffuse components are substantially smaller than the 36  extraction region , such that they can both be considered as approximate point sources for the _ xmm _  analysis . in both data",
    "sets the source region was on - axis and did not lie on any chip gaps .",
    "we extracted pn spectra for counts in the energy range 0.215 kev and with event patterns 04 .",
    "response files were produced from the _ xmm - newton _  current calibration files corresponding to the time of this observation .",
    "the source arf is calculated including a correction for photons falling outside the extraction region .",
    "this energy - encircled fraction ( eef ) varies with energy but is @xmath1985% at 5 kev .",
    "the source spectrum is described with the same model as for _ chandra _ , consisting of vmekal and power law components ( equation  [ eqn : source ] ) .    to maximize the number of counts in the background spectra and",
    "thus achieve the highest possible signal - to - noise ratio , we extracted the background spectrum from a large annulus of outer radius 3 arcmin around the source .",
    "based on a number of trials , the 3 arcmin annulus was determined to provide the optimum number of background counts without needing to account for the variation in background flux at larger off - axis angles . using the sas command edetect_chain , 5 sources in the pn field of view were detected and subsequently excluded from the background region . with these sources excluded",
    ", the background region is @xmath1923 arcmin@xmath20 in area , or 20 times larger than the source region .",
    "because the background emission is extended in nature , the arf for the background region did not include an eef correction .",
    "the pn background spectrum was fitted with two components .",
    "the instrumental background is modeled by a power law continuum , plus gaussian emission lines caused by fluorescence ( al k-@xmath21 at 1.5 kev and cuni k-@xmath21 at 8.5 kev @xcite . because this instrumental background is produced internally to the detector and is not affected by the mirror response , in modeling the observed counts it was was convolved with an rmf but not multiplied by an arf .",
    "the background line energies were determined from fitting each line individually , and then fixed for the full spectral analysis , while the intrinsic line widths are fixed to be consistent with zero .",
    "the sky background component is dominated by the diffuse soft cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , which can be modeled as thin - thermal emission @xcite .",
    "we used an apec model for this component , to match the spectral shape obtained by @xcite in fitting the unresolved cxb spectrum in the _ chandra _  deep fields , fixing @xmath22 kev and allowing the normalization to float .",
    "the hard ( @xmath23 kev ) cxb can be described as a power law owing to the summed emission from a large number of agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we did not include this as a separate component here , as the average expected numbers of counts is @xmath242% of the instrumental background , so its small contribution to the total background flux can be effectively accounted for in our modeling of the instrumental background .    the full model for the total observed emission in the _ xmm _",
    "source region is :    @xmath25    the source spectrum is modeled by an absorbed vmekal and power law ( equation  [ eqn : source ] ) , while the background components are modeled , in xspec notation , as :    @xmath26    and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is convolved with the rmf only , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are convolved by the rmf and multiplied by the arf .",
    "as discussed below , the fluxes of the nuclear power law component in the _ xmm _ observations are significantly smaller than that observed for _",
    "chandra_. to most accurately extract the weak hard x - ray signal from the significant background , we modeled the data by simultaneously fitting the source and background spectra , using the model given in equation  [ eqn : xmm ] .",
    "we account for the differences in area between the source and background regions by setting the areascal parameter on the background spectrum .",
    "the spectral parameters of the instrumental and sky backgrounds were fixed to be equal for the source and background spectra . the source component is also included in the background spectrum , but multiplied by a factor @xmath31 to approximately model the flux scattered outside the source region into the background region .",
    "( the scaling factor accounts for both the energy encircled fraction and the relative area of the source and background regions ; the ultimate fit parameters are insensitive to the precise value of this factor . )    because the soft ( vmekal ) emission from the source is diffuse ( with a diameter of @xmath195or 200 pc ) , and thus a light - crossing time much longer than the separation in time between observations , it should not be observed to vary in our data .",
    "therefore , to maximize the statistical power of our modeling , we fitted the 2004 and 2011 _ xmm _ spectra simultaneously , tying the temperatures and normalizations of the vmekal and apec components between the two data sets .",
    "we allowed the the nuclear power - law normalization to float , along with the instrumental background parameters ( the particle background in the detectors should not be perfectly constant for the duration of the mission ) .",
    "we thus performed a simultaneous fit to four spectra : source and background spectra from each of the 2004 and 2011 .",
    "the results of the spectral fitting are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] and listed in table  [ table : params ] .",
    "we observe a clear decrease in the flux of the hard nuclear component between the 2001 _ chandra _ and 2004 _ xmm _ observations .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : compare ] , in which we show the 2004 _ xmm _ pn spectrum fitted with the 2001 _ chandra _ best - fit model , with no model for the _ xmm _ background included .",
    "this shows that the hard source flux has dropped dramatically from the _ chandra _ level , even before accounting for the _ xmm _ background .",
    "we observe a further , less significant decrease between the 2004 and 2011 _ xmm _",
    "observations , while the flux of the diffuse ( vmekal ) component is consistent with no variation from the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "we also observe evidence for a decrease in absorption on the nuclear component , with @xmath32 consistent with zero .",
    "the best - fit @xmath33 of the vmekal component for _ xmm _ is close but not fully statistically consistent with the _ chandra _ data ( @xmath34 kev compared to @xmath35 kev ) .",
    "fixing this temperature to the _ chandra _ value has a negligible effect on the flux of the diffuse component , but decreases the flux of the hard nuclear component by @xmath1915% .",
    "this results in an even larger observed drop in flux compared to the _ chandra _ data ; in the following discussion we will conservatively consider the smaller change in flux obtained when the vmekal @xmath33 allowed to float for _ xmm_. the flux of the apec component , representing the soft diffuse cxb , corresponds to a 0.52 kev surface brightness of @xmath36 erg @xmath8 s@xmath37 deg@xmath38 , similar to the soft background intensity obtained in the _ chandra _ deep fields @xcite .",
    "the overall implications of the spectral fitting results are discussed in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "one potential uncertainty in our spectral analysis arises from the implicit assumption that the instrumental and sky background in the source region has the same surface brightness to the emission in the background region .",
    "it is possible that fluctuations in the background could cause this assumption to be invalid , leading to over- or under - subtraction of the background , particularly at energies @xmath182 kev where the background dominates the signal . to directly check the level of possible fluctations , we extracted the 210 kev counts in 80 circular regions of 36  radius ( equal to the source region ) surrounding the source region .",
    "we avoid chip gaps and obvious bright sources , noting that there is no bright point source detected within 36  in the 28 kev _ chandra _ image ( figure  [ fig : area ] ) .",
    "the 210 kev counts in these apertures are approximately normally distributed , with mean ( dispersion ) of 239 ( 19 ) and 138 ( 15 ) counts for 2004 and 2011 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that our modeling of the background in the source region is dominated by statistical error rather than any systematic uncertainty due to background fluctuations .      as a measurement of the baseline level of flux prior to the _ chandra _ observations",
    ", we also utilize observations of he 210 from _ asca _  in 1997 . due to _ asca _ s poor angular resolution and sensitivity relative to _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ , it provides relatively weak constraints on the source flux , particularly in the hard nuclear component .",
    "we will therefore focus our conclusions primarily on the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ data , but will utilize the _ asca _ data here as a useful check on our conclusions .",
    "he 210 was observed by _ asca _  for a total of 39.8 ks on 30 november 1997 .",
    "we used xselect v2.4b to remove time intervals of high background for a net exposure of 22.4 ks , and to extract source and background spectra from the cleaned event files .",
    "we extracted a spectrum in the energy range between 0.510.5 kev , using a source extraction region of 1.45 arcmin in radius .",
    "this source region was chosen to contain as much of the source flux as possible ( the energy encircled fraction is 50% ) while minimizing the contribution from background .",
    "we extracted a background spectrum from a rectangular annulus of area @xmath195 times that of the source region , located around the source position but excluding the source region .",
    "the rmf and arf response files were generated for each chip using the commands sisrmg and ascaarf , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the spectra from the two chips sis0 and sis1 were added using the heasoft command mathpha , while the response files were added with area dependent weights using the commands addarf and addrmf . as discussed in   [ sec : xmm ] , the source arf includes a correction for the energy encircled fraction , while the background arf does not .    as with _ xmm _ , we modeled the _",
    "data by fitting the source and background spectra simultaneously , modeling the scattered flux in the background region assuming an energy - encircled fraction of 0.5 .",
    "the instrumental background was modeled with a power law plus five gaussian emission lines ; three were included in the model as narrow fluorescence lines stemming from the device itself at 6.5 kev , 7.5 kev , and 8.2 kev , which are the fe and ni k-@xmath21 lines and the ni k-@xmath39 line .",
    "another gaussian at 3.3 kev of unknown origin was introduced to fit a feature of the background spectrum , while the final gaussian was a broad line at 11 kev that modeled the internal background above 7 kev to account for the steepness of the power law .",
    "we utilized the same source and sky background models as for _ xmm _  ( equations [ eqn : source ] and [ eqn : skybg ] ) . because they can not be well - constrained owing to the poor photon statistics , the surface brightness of the apec component and the vmekal temperature are fixed to the values obtained with _",
    "xmm _ , and the photon index of the power law",
    "is again fixed to @xmath12 .",
    "( allowing the vmekal temperature to float yields a significantly higher @xmath40 , inconsistent with the _ xmm _  and _ chandra _  results , but has a negligible effect on the total fluxes of the diffuse and nuclear components . ) the results of the _ asca _  spectral fitting are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] and listed in table  [ table : params ] .",
    "we obtain a significant detection of both the diffuse and nuclear spectral components , although with significantly larger uncertainties than in the _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  data .",

    "the variation in the light curve of hard spectral component he 210 over approximately an order of magnitude in @xmath55 confirms that this emission is the result of a single object , rather than several separate sources .",
    "this allows us to perform comparisons to other individual astrophysical sources .",
    "one class of object that can have similar x - ray and luminosities and amplitudes of variability is sne ( see @xcite for a compilation of published sn x - ray light curves ) .",
    "however , a sn interpretation for the nuclear source is inconsistent with the radio properties . the radio flux of he 210 has been measured at 5 ghz with the vla in 1994 ( @xmath56 mjy ; @xcite ) and 2004 ( @xmath57 mjy ; @xcite ) , implying no significant change in the radio flux with time . long baseline array measurements in 2011 at 1.4 ghz yield a flux of @xmath58 mjy in a compact source on @xmath191 pc spatial scales ; assuming a typical radio spectral index",
    ", this implies that roughly half of the observed 5 ghz flux comes from the central compact source @xcite .",
    "high sensitivity array observations in 2005 did not detect the compact source on extremely small ( @xmath50.1 pc ) spatial scales @xcite , placing a lower limit on its spatial extent .",
    "this rules out out the presence of a single very young sn , however the total radio luminosity of the source would imply that any single sn must be at most decades old @xcite .    with these constraints in mind",
    ", we test whether the nuclear source in he 210 is consistent with a ( relatively ) evolved sn explosion , by comparing its ( unabsorbed ) soft x - ray and 5 ghz radio light curves to a sample of 7 sne that have both radio and x - ray measurements in the compilations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assuming that the nuclear source in he 210 has a relatively constant 5 ghz flux between 1994 and 2004 , and conservatively assigning all the 5 ghz flux observed with the vla ( @xmath190.9 mjy ) to the central compact component , we find that the ratio of x - ray ( 0.52 kev ) to radio ( @xmath59 at 5 ghz ) for he 210 is @xmath5@xmath60 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than the typical x - ray to radio flux ratio for x - ray - detected sne at ages @xmath181 year , and 2.5 times larger than the most extreme observed values , in sne 1980k and 1970 g .",
    "further , the detection of the nuclear hard x - ray component in the _ asca _  observation indicates that the x - ray light curve rises or remains constant , and then declines sharply over a few years .",
    "this behavior is unusual for sne ; of the eight sn x - ray light curves in the compilation of @xcite that extend beyond ten years , none shows a similar sudden , rapid decline on these time scales .",
    "we also note that the x - ray to radio flux ratio is consistently at least 23 orders of magnitude _ smaller _ than the typical ratio of x - ray to compact radio flux for ulxs , for which the compact sources tend to be weak or undetected in the radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the observed x - ray light curve and the ratio of x - ray and radio luminosities , we conclude that the observations do not favor a sn or ulx origin for the nuclear source .",
    "in contrast , the significant variability of the hard nuclear x - ray source in he 210 is consistent with its identification as an accreting massive bh , in comparison to the x - ray variability of known low - mass agn .",

    "the nearby edge - on seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 4945 , with a bh mass obtained through observations of its h@xmath620 megamaser of @xmath63 , shows intrinsic variability ( measured at @xmath188 kev by _ rxte _ and _ swift_/bat ) of at least an order of magnitude on timescales of days to weeks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the agn in the nearby seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 ( @xmath64 ; @xcite ) has been observed to vary in x - ray luminosity by more than an order of magnitude over @xmath5year timescales @xcite .",
    "this limited survey confirms that x - ray variability over a large dynamic range on timescales of years is not uncommon among relatively low - mass agns .",
