    "the classical stein - tomas restriction theorem says that if @xmath4 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath5 , the unit sphere in @xmath6 , or , more generally , on a smooth convex surface with everywhere non - vanishing curvature , then @xmath7    it is shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that if the gaussian curvature is allowed to vanish , ( [ steintomas ] ) does not hold .",
    "nevertheless , there is hope of obtaining ( [ steintomas ] ) for all reasonable surfaces by modifying the surface carried measure in some universal way . for example , if @xmath8 is the lebesgue measure on a convex compact smooth surface @xmath9 , finite type in the sense that the order of contact with every tangent line is finite , and @xmath10 , then one can check using standard techniques that the estimate ( [ steintomas ] ) holds .",
    "the situation becomes much more complicated if the gaussian curvature is allowed to vanish to infinite order .",
    "carbery , kenig and ziesler @xcite recently proved ( [ steintomas ] ) for suitably weighted measures on surfaces of revolution in three dimensions under some quantitative assumption on the graphing function .    in @xcite , the authors took a different point of view . instead of imposing a fixed measure on the family of surfaces ,",
    "they considered mixed norm restriction theorems corresponding to convex curves under rotations .",
    "the approach was heavily tied to the average decay estimates of the fourier transform of the lebesgue measure on convex curves , due to podkorytov , which made the convexity assumption difficult to by - pass . in this paper , we take a geometric point of view which allows us to consider a much more general collection of surfaces . our main result is the following .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath4 be the frostman measure on a compact @xmath11-dimensional surface @xmath12 in @xmath0 given as the graph of a @xmath13 function . recall that @xmath1 is the class of functions in two variables whose gradient is in @xmath14 .    given @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the special orthogonal group ,",
    "define the random measure @xmath17 by the formula @xmath18 then , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the haar measure on @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the same estimate holds if @xmath4 is the frostman measure on any compact subset of @xmath22 of hausdorff dimension greater than two .",
    "the condition we need to impose on the measure @xmath4 in order for the conclusion of theorem [ main ] to hold is that @xmath23 this condition holds for lipschitz surfaces , but it also holds for many measures supported on sets that are far from rectifiable in any sense .",
    "for example , consider a sequence of positive integers @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , neighborhood of @xmath30}^d)$ ] .",
    "let @xmath31 . by standard geometric measure theory",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 .",
    "one can check by a direct calculation that ( [ e : mu - epsilon ] ) holds .",

    "was partially supported by the nsf grant dms-0531337 .",
    "let @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the haar ( probability ) measure on @xmath37 .    on one hand ,",
    "@xmath38 since convolution of two @xmath39 functions is in @xmath39 by fubini .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath40 it follows by interpolation and setting @xmath41 that if @xmath42 then @xmath43 this reduces matters to the study of ( [ convolutionbound ] ) and this is what the remainder of the paper is about . since @xmath44 we can easily arrange to take a supremum over @xmath45 away from a fixed neighborhood of the origin .",
    "this is precisely what we shall do in the sequel .",
    "by the fourier inversion formula @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50    [ smooth3 ] the function @xmath51 is constant .",
    "the proof is immediate since the haar measure @xmath52 is an invariant probability measure .",
    "since @xmath45 is fixed , just compose @xmath53 with the map that takes @xmath54 back to @xmath55 and conclude that @xmath56    going back we see that the expression in ( [ stationary3 ] ) equals @xmath57    @xmath58    so the problem reduces to showing that @xmath59 this completes the proof of the three dimensional result , up to ( [ e : mu - mu ] ) , which takes care of the first part of theorem [ main ] . to prove the second part , observe again that we may assume that @xmath60 . by the method of stationary phase ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , we get @xmath61 and so the expression ( [ e : fourier3 - 1 ] ) is @xmath62 = c ^-2 d(x ) d(y ) , @xmath63 which certainly converges if @xmath4 is the frostman measure on a set of hausdorff dimension greater than two .",
    "this approach just fails to work for two dimensional sets and this is where the @xmath13 assumption will play a key role .",
    "we now turn to the final section of our paper where this is done .",
    "in this section we establish ( [ e : mu - mu ] ) for measures supported on graphs of @xmath1 functions .",
    "assume for a moment that @xmath4 is the lebesgue measure on a graph of a @xmath64 function @xmath65 .",
    "we may do that as long as our estimates do not quantitatively depend on this smoothness assumption .",
    "if @xmath65 were lipschitz , the right hand side above would automatically be bounded by @xmath69 , independent of @xmath45 , and the proof of ( [ e : mu - mu ] ) would be complete .",
    "since we are only assuming that @xmath65 is in @xmath1 , we have more work to do .",
    "we must show that @xmath70 where @xmath71 does not depend on smoothness of @xmath65 .    since the set @xmath72 is contained in a curved @xmath73 square , and we may take @xmath74 arbitrarily small , it is enough to show that @xmath75 and this follows instantly from the @xmath1 assumption on @xmath65 .",
    "this completes the proof ."
