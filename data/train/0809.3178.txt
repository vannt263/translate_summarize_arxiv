    "the stellar absorption lines from the near - ir calcium triplet ( cat ) made their debut in the field of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with the work of terlevich , daz & terlevich ( 1990 , hereinafter tdt ) . at that time",
    ", it was thought that the optical spectrum of seyfert 2s contained a featureless continuum ( fc ) from the agn , which , in light of unification scenarios ( antonucci 1993 ) , should be associated with scattered light from the hidden seyfert 1 nucleus ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "tdt realized that this idea could not be fully correct , since their data indicated that , unlike for absorption lines in the optical , the strength of the cat in these sources shows no signs of dilution with respect to the values found in normal galaxies .",
    "their interpretation of this fact was that what was called a `` non - stellar fc '' was in fact a stellar component associated to young stellar populations .",
    "this conclusion was thoroughly confirmed by numerous studies in the past decade ( see cid fernandes 2004 for a review ) .    since then , interest in the cat shifted towards its use as a tracer of stellar kinematics , particularly in agn .",
    "the location of the cat in a relatively clean spectral region makes it an ideal feature to measure stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath6 ) , which trace the gravitational potential of the host galaxy s bulge . in an influential work ,",
    "nelson & whittle ( 1996 ; nw ) used the cat in a comparison between stellar and gaseous kinematics of agn , finding that the typical velocity narrow line region ( nlr ) clouds ( @xmath3 ) correlates with @xmath6 , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "more recently , a strong correlation between @xmath6 and black - hole mass ( tremaine 2002 and references therein ) indirectly boosted interest in observations of the cat ( nelson 2000 ; botte 2004 ) .    for completely different reasons , recent work on normal galaxies has also raised the interest in the cat .",
    "empirical investigations have revealed rather puzzling behavior of the cat in bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "firstly , detailed population synthesis models tend to over - predict the cat strength ( saglia 2002 ; cenarro 2003 , 2004 ) , particularly for giant ellipticals , though for dwarf ellipticals the match between data and models is satisfactory ( michielsen 2007 ) .",
    "secondly , while classic metallicity tracers like the mg@xmath7 index are known to correlate with @xmath6 ( eg , terlevich 1981 ) , tracing the well - known mass - metallicity relation , the strength of the cat appears to be _ anti - correlated _ with @xmath6 ( cenarro 2003 , 2004 ; falcn - barroso 2003 ; michielsen 2003 ) .",
    "the interpretation of these results is still not clear , and the situation is likely to be even more complex in systems with varied star formation histories like agn ( cid fernandes 2004 ; wild 2007 ) .",
    "one thus sees that , more than 15 years after tdt introduced the cat in agn research , there are still plenty of reasons to keep studying it . with this general motivation , in paper",
    "i we have carried out a spectroscopic survey of seyfert galaxies in the region including the cat and the [ siii]@xmath09069 emission line .",
    "paper i concentrated in the presentation of the data and the derivation of four main data products : stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath6 ) , [ siii ] emission line widths ( @xmath8}$ ] , which is representative of the highly ionized component of the gas of the narrow line region in agns ) , [ siii ] equivalent widths ( @xmath9}$ ] ) , and the cat strength ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "here we use these data to address the following issues : ( 1 ) examine the contribution of a non - stellar component in the near - ir spectra of seyfert galaxies and test the consistency of @xmath9}$ ] and @xmath1 data with the unified model , ( 2 ) study the sensitivity of @xmath1 to stellar population properties , ( 3 ) investigate the connection between nlr and stellar kinematics and cat strength , and ( 4 ) report results of spatially resolved spectroscopy , not reported in paper i.    to study these questions , we complement the data in paper i with values of the equivalent width of the caii k line ( @xmath4 ) obtained from previous studies .",
    "as shown by cid fernandes ( 2001 ) , the caii k line is a powerful tracer of stellar populations even in type 2 seyferts . by comparing @xmath1 with @xmath4 we can assess whether the cat is a useful stellar population tracer , and determine whether the combination of cak and cat strengths is explained as due to stars alone or if an fc component is necessary .",
    "we also add in literature information on the width ( @xmath10}$ ] ) of the [ oiii]@xmath05007 line , which is useful to test whether our results are somehow affected by the choice of [ siii]@xmath09069 as a tracer of nlr motions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : cat_nonstellarlight ] presents a series of studies related to the cat strength . after showing cat observational properties in [ subsec : cat in sy ]",
    ", we compare @xmath1 with @xmath4 in [ subsec : dilution ] and investigate whether the location of the points in the @xmath1 versus @xmath4 diagram is consistent with the existence of an fc at near - ir wavelengths . in [ stellar models ] we use evolutionary synthesis models to track the behavior of both @xmath1 and @xmath4 as a function of age and metallicity , and overlay the models onto the data in the @xmath1 versus @xmath4 diagram . in [ subsec :",
    "spatial cat profiles ] we study the spatial behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath1 for about half of our sample . in section [ sec : kinematics ] we analyze stellar and ionized gas kinematics : stellar velocity dispersions and its relation to cat are studied in [ subsec : stellar velocity dispersions ] , while in [ subsec : stellar vs. nlr kinematics ] we discuss the link between stellar and gas kinematics .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] summarizes our main results .",
    "one of our goals is to evaluate the usefulness of the cat as a stellar population diagnostic . since our sample is dominated by agn , before discussing stellar populations we must first examine to which extent non - stellar light affects our cat measurements .",
    "as explained in paper i , we adopt the @xmath1 and @xmath11 definitions of cenarro et al ( 2001a ) .",
    "they offer two definitions of the cat equivalent width : ` cat ' ( which we call @xmath1 ) , which consists of a sum of the equivalent widths of all three cat lines , and ` cat * ' ( called @xmath11 here ) , which corrects @xmath1 for contamination by paschen line absorption .",
    "these equivalent widths are measured with respect to a continuum defined by fitting the spectrum in 5 windows in the 8474 - 8792   range .",
    "because of the presence of unwanted features in the observed spectra , we opted to measure @xmath12 and @xmath11 on the synthetic spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "our spectral base used to fit the observed spectra does not have stars with the spectral types with paschen lines , so we use @xmath12 as equivalent widths measurements for our spectra .",
    "all nuclear cat data refers to appertures of @xmath13 2  @xmath14 2  ( paper i ) . to take into account the different velocity dispersions of our galaxies",
    ", we broadened each spectrum to match the largest value of @xmath15 of our sample , corresponding to ngc 3115 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 km / s ) .",
    "this correction changes the value of @xmath1 by typically @xmath18 with respect to the uncorrected values given in paper i. @xmath4 measurements from cid fernandes et al ( 2004 ) are also used in our analysis .",
    "it is well known that a non stellar light is present in seyfert 1s .",
    "the contribution of such a component in seyfert 2s has been a topic of much controversy in the past .",
    "one way to address this issue is to compare seyfert 1s with seyfert 2s through cat .",
    "[ fig_hist_ews ] ( top panel ) shows the distributions of @xmath12 for seyfert galaxies in our sample , with seyfert 1s ( including subtypes 11.9 ) marked by the filled areas .",
    "almost all seyfert 2 lie between 4 and 8  , with a median of 6.5  .",
    "@xmath1 tends to be smaller in type 1 nuclei , with a median of 4.8  .",
    "emission lines from the nlr follow the same pattern , with smaller equivalent widths in seyfert 1s than in seyfert 2s , as shown for [ siii]@xmath19 in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the fact that @xmath23 and similarly @xmath24}({\\rm sey 1 } ) < w_{[siii]}({\\rm sey 2})$ ] is consistent with the unified model , which predicts a dilution of the equivalent widths of the absorption and emission lines in sources where the nuclear non - stellar continuum is seen directly .",
    "the fact that the range of cat strengths spanned by seyfert 2s is similar to that spanned by non - active galaxies indicates that their scattered fc , if present , is too weak to produce a noticeable effect on the near - ir range .",
    "while the results reported above suggest one does not need to worry about non - stellar light in the cat range in seyfert 2s , it is desirable to test this idea more conclusively before proceeding to an analysis of @xmath1 in terms of stellar populations alone .",
    "this can be done combining our cat data with information from a different wavelength range .",
    "the equivalent width of the caii k absorption at 3933   ( @xmath4 ) provides the necessary information .    the cak line , which originates in old , late - type stars from the host s bulge , is very sensitive to dilution by an underlying blue continuum . as usual",
    ", this continuum can be either due to an agn or to a young stellar population , and the value of @xmath4 by itself can not distinguish between these two possibilities ( e.g. , storchi - bergmann 2000 ) .",
    "the combination of @xmath4 and @xmath1 data helps lifting this ambiguity .",
    "the idea , first developed by tdt , is simple : if the cak is diluted by a truly featureless continuum , and if this fc extends from the optical to the near ir , then the cat would be diluted too , and by a predictable amount . from observations of type 1 seyferts and quasars ,",
    "we know that the agn optical continuum is well described by a power - law @xmath25 , with @xmath26 in the 12 range or , equivalently , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "this fc is superposed to the bulge stellar light .",
    "suppose that the bulge has intrinsic cak and cat equivalent widths @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and that the ratio of the stellar continuum fluxes over these two lines is @xmath31 .",
    "trivial algebra then leads to the following relation between the observed cak and cat equivalent widths :    @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the fraction of the total continuum at 3933   which comes from the fc .",
    "we modeled a mixing of a fc and bulge continuum in a form of `` fc + ssp '' mixing lines , where ssp refers to a simple stellar population representative of 10 gyr old , typical of elliptical galaxies and bulges , as obtained from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , bc03 ) models for solar metallicity .",
    "practical use of equation [ eq : dilution ] requires stipulating fiducial values for @xmath29 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt @xmath37   and @xmath38 .",
    "equation [ eq : dilution ] is over plotted to the data points in the @xmath1 versus @xmath4 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cat_x_cak_a ] ) .",
    "the lines indicate the bulge + fc mixing lines for different values of the slope @xmath26 and for @xmath39 decreasing from 100% at @xmath40 to 0% at @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath4 measurements come from the optical studies of cid fernandes ( 1998 , 2001 , 2004 ) . of the 78 galaxies in our sample ,",
    "42 overlap with these studies , most of which ( 31 ) correspond to seyfert 2s .",
    "we see that some seyfert nuclei line up along the mixing lines .",
    "however , in order to explain all of the objects , it is necessary a contribution of @xmath39 of about 50% or greater .",
    "there are some seyfert with high @xmath1 and low @xmath4 that are not explained in terms of these mixing lines for @xmath26 between 1 ( @xmath42=1 ) and 2 ( @xmath42=0 ) , which are representative of type 1 agn . for these objects ,",
    "only if @xmath26 were as low as @xmath43 or less the dilution lines would go approximately through the observed values , but not even quasars have such an extremely blue continuum .",
    "such a blue fc could in principle be produced by scattering of the agn light by dust particles .",
    "nevertheless , the required values of the @xmath39 fraction ( of the order of @xmath44 ) would imply that scattered broad lines in the optical should become visible , in which case the galaxy would not be classified as a seyfert 2 in the first place ( an argument first put forward by cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) . besides that ,",
    "about half of the seyfert 2s with @xmath39 greater than 50% show high order balmer lines ( hobl ) in absorption in their spectra ( gonzlez delgado 2001 ) .",

    "[ fig_cat_x_cak_a ] should be considered as an upper limit for `` fc + ssp '' models .",

    "so , our main conclusions about fc + bulge mixing models for seyfert 2 nuclei remains valid .",
    "tdt have performed the same analysis , but using the mgib line at 5175   instead of cak ( see also jimnez - benito 2000 ) . they conclude that if the observed dilution of mgib is due to a power - law fc of reasonable slope , then the cat would also be diluted , contrary to their empirical result . here , we considered `` fc + ssp '' mixing models with some reasonable combination of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath36 values representative of old stellar populations .",
    "these models shows that dilution by a power - law fc seems to be not completely adequate to account for the observed strengths of optical and near - infrared ranges simultaneously .",
    "hence , a simple mixture of a bulge - like component plus an agn - like fc , envisaged in the early days of agn research ( e.g. , koski 1978 ) , is just not a viable description of the data .",
    "we will analyse another explanation for @xmath4 and @xmath1 behavior in the next section .",
    "now that we considered dilution by non - stellar light in the cat range in type 2 seyferts , we will proceed to a stellar population analysis .",
    "the behavior of the cat equivalent width as a function of stellar parameters ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , [ fe / h ] ) has been addressed by several studies ( e.g. , daz , terlevich & terlevich 1989 ) , and this knowledge has been incorporated into population synthesis models which map the cat dependence on the age and metallicity of coeval stellar populations ( e.g. , idiart , thevenin & de freitas pacheco 1997 ) . in a recent and comprehensive study , cenarro and",
    "coworkers revisited this topic , analyzing the cat in a large library of stars and producing state - of - the - art predictions for the behavior of the cat in integrated stellar populations ( cenarro 2001a , b,2002 ; vazdekis 2003 ) .    despite early hopes that the cat could serve as a metallicity indicator for galaxies ( as it does for globular clusters , at least below @xmath48 ; armandroff & zinn 1988 ;",
    "idiart 1997 ; vazdekis 2003 ) , or as tracers of recent star - formation through its sensitivity to the presence of red super - giants ( hereafter rsg ; see tdt ; garca - vargas , moll & bressan 1998 ; mayya 1997 ) , observations have revealed that the cat shows remarkably little variation in strength for galaxies spanning wide ranges in morphological and stellar population properties .",
    "this small sensitivity is qualitatively consistent with the new generation of synthesis models ( vazdekis 2003 ) , which show that , for metallicities higher than @xmath49 dex , this feature varies little as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "overall , these results raise serious doubts as to the usefulness of the cat as a stellar population diagnostic . in this section",
    "we take another look at this issue , tackling it from an empirical perspective . as in the previous section ,",
    "information on the cak line will be incorporated in the analysis .",
    "let us assume that strongly diluted cak lines in seyfert 2s are the result of the presence of a starburst component , in line with previous investigations .",
    "in particular , cid fernandes ( 2001 ) propose that seyfert 2s with @xmath50   can be safely identified as composite starburst + agn systems , where the starburst is unambiguously identified by independent features such as the wr bump or pcygni line profiles in the uv .",
    "investigating the behavior of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath4 thus provides a fully empirical test of whether the cat is or is not sensitive to stellar populations .    a cat versus cak diagram was already shown in fig .",
