    "we will exhibit a similar convergence of different investigative approaches to vector flows on surfaces _ with boundary_.    we will take advantage of the relative simplicity of @xmath0 flows to illustrate and popularize the main ideas of our recent research of _ traversally generic",
    "_ flows on manifolds with boundary .",
    "when the results are specific to the dimension two , their validation will be presented in detail .",
    "the multidimensional arguments that resist significant simplifications in @xmath0 will be described and explained in general terms .    throughout the investigation",
    ", we focus on the interactions of gradient flows with the boundary , rather than on the critical points of morse functions .",
    "so , in our approach to the morse theory , the boundary effects rule .",
    "_ morse theory _",
    ", the classical book of john w. milnor @xcite , starts with the canonical picture of a morse function @xmath1 on a 2-dimensional torus @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "it is portrayed as the height function @xmath3 on the torus @xmath2 residing in the space @xmath4 .",
    "the height @xmath3 has four _ critical points _ : @xmath5 , and @xmath6 so that @xmath7 a point @xmath8 is called critical if the differential @xmath9 of @xmath3 vanishes at @xmath8 . in the vicinity of each critical point @xmath8 , @xmath2 admits a pair of local coordinate functions , say @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so that locally the function @xmath3 acquires the form @xmath12 where the signs may form four possible combinations .",
    "[ fig1.1 ]        we call a vector field @xmath13 , tangent to @xmath2 , _ gradient - like _ if @xmath14 everywhere outside of the set @xmath15 of critical points .",
    "if the torus is  slightly slanted \" with respect to the vertical coordinate @xmath3 in @xmath4 , then the following picture emerges .",
    "the majority of downward trajectories of the @xmath3-gradient flow @xmath16 that emanate from @xmath17 , asymptotically reach @xmath6 .",
    "there are two trajectories that asymptotically link @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and two trajectories that link @xmath17 with @xmath19 .",
    "no ( unbroken ) trajectory asymptotically connects @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "perhaps , a more transparent depiction of the gradient flow @xmath16 is given in fig .",
    "2 , where the torus is shown in terms of its fundamental domain , the square . to form @xmath2 ,",
    "the opposite sides of the square are identified in pairs .",
    "the morse theory is concerned with the sets of _ constant level _ @xmath20 and the _ below constant level _ sets @xmath21 .",
    "the main observation is that the topology of these sets is changing in an essential way only when the rising @xmath22 crosses the critical values @xmath23 each such  critical crossing \" results in an _ elementary surgery _ on the set @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is just below a critical value @xmath24 . for a small @xmath25 , an elementary surgery @xmath26 attaches the _ handle _",
    "@xmath27 to the set @xmath28 .",
    "eventually , when @xmath22 rises above @xmath29 , the entire topology of torus @xmath2 is captured by a sequence of these elementary surgeries .    from a different angle ,",
    "the knowledge of how the critical points @xmath30 interact via the trajectories of the @xmath31-flow is also sufficient for reconstructing the surface @xmath2 as fig .",
    "2 suggests ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig1.2 ]        note that , in the vicinity of each critical point , the gradient flow exhibits _ discontinuity _ : small changes in the initial position of a point @xmath8 , residing in the vicinity of a critical point , result in significant differences in the position of @xmath32 for big positive / small negative values of @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in fact , this discontinuity of the gradient flow , expressed in terms of the _ stable _ and _ unstable manifolds _ of critical points ( see @xcite ) , captures the topology of the surface ( as the left diagram in fig . 2 suggests ) !    [ fig1.3 ]        as a result of gradient flow discontinuity , the _ space of trajectories _",
    "@xmath34 is pathological ( non - separable ) .",
    "the space @xmath34 is constructed by declaring equivalent any two points that reside on the same trajectory .",
    "when a compact connected surface @xmath35 has a nonempty boundary @xmath36 , traditionally , the morse function @xmath37 is assumed to be constant on @xmath36 and its gradient flow interacts with the boundary in constrained way .",
    "then the _ relative topology _ of the pair @xmath38 can be captured in the ways analogous to the previous description of the morse theory on torus .",
    "in fact , the morse theory on manifolds with boundary can be viewed as a very special instance of the morse theory on stratified spaces ( the two strata @xmath36 and @xmath35 form the stratification ) .",
    "the latter was developed by goresky and macpherson in [ gm ] -[gm2 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different philosophy for the morse theory on compact surfaces / manifolds @xmath35 _ with boundary_. to formulate it , let us revisit our favorite closed surface , the torus . by deleting from @xmath2 small disks , centered on the points of the critical set @xmath15 , we manufacture a surface @xmath35 whose boundary is a disjoint union of four circles . evidently , @xmath37 has no critical points at all .",
    "still it has a nontrivial topology ! can this topology be reconstructed from some data , provided by the critical point - free @xmath3 and its gradient - like field @xmath39 ?",
    "an experienced reader would notice that the restriction @xmath40 has critical points ( maxima and minima ) , some of which interact _ along _ the boundary ( with the help of a gradient - like field @xmath41 , tangent to @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , it is quite clear that these interactions are not sufficient for a reconstruction of the topology of @xmath35 ! in fact , a reconstruction of the surface @xmath35 becomes possible if one introduces additional interactions between the points of @xmath42 that occur  through the bulk @xmath35 \" and are defined with the help of _ both _ vector fields @xmath13 and @xmath41 .",
    "this observation has been explored by a number of authors , but it is not the world view that we are promoting here ...    to dramatize further the situation we are facing , let us place four small disks , centered on the critical points of @xmath1 , into a single open disk @xmath43 and form @xmath44 ( see fig 2 , the right diagram ) .",
    "again , @xmath45 has no critical points , the gradient field @xmath46 , but its topology of @xmath35 is nontrivial .",
    "this time , the boundary @xmath36 of the punctured torus @xmath35 is just a single circle !",
    "let us keep this challenge in mind .",
    "can one propose a  morse theory \" that is not centered on critical points ?",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "it relies on the following observation .",
    "typically , in the vicinity of @xmath36 , the @xmath13-trajectories are interacting with the boundary in a number of very particular and stable ways : they are either transversal to @xmath36 , or are tangent to it in a _ concave _ or _ convex _ fashion for which some trajectories will be cubically tangent to the boundary , but the majority of vector fields @xmath13 avoid such cubic tangencies . ]",
    "( see fig .",
    "so the boundary @xmath35 may be  wiggly \" with respect to the flow .",
    "we claim that this geometry of the @xmath13-flow in connection to the boundary @xmath36 is the crucial ingredient for reconstructions of @xmath35 in terms of the flow ( see section 8 , especially theorem [ th7.1 ] ) .    in the vicinity of a",
    "_ concave _ tangency point , the @xmath13-flow is _ discontinuous _ in the same sense as the gradient flow is discontinuous in the vicinity of its critical point : in time , close initial points become distant . in this context",
    ", the divergence of initially close points occurs due to very different _ travel times _ available to them ; unlike the infinite travel time for the gradient flows of the morse theory on _ closed _ surfaces , in the case of the non - singular gradient flows on surfaces with boundary , every point exits the surface in finite time .",
    "in particular , the surface is _ not _ flow - invariant . and",
    "again , these discontinuities of the flow reflect the topology of the surface .",
    "let us clarify this point .",

    "the nonsingular function @xmath37 is the vertical coordinate in @xmath49 .",
