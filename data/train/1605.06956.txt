    "thermal transport in shear flows is a fundamental problem in fluid mechanics that arises in many engineering and geophysical situations .",
    "it combines phenomena in fluid layers without external shear ( the rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) flow , @xcite ) and in shear flows without heating @xcite .",
    "the onset of convection in the rb setting has been studied in considerable detail in various geometries @xcite .",
    "the properties of shear flows are less well understood because of the difficulties presented by the manner in which they become turbulent @xcite .",
    "in contrast to rb flows , turbulence in shear flows is often observed when the laminar profile is still linearly stable , so that the transition requires with finite amplitude perturbations that reach states that arise in subcritical bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the advective nature and the spatial development in open boundary layers add to the complexity .",
    "the interaction between shear and convection has been studied in boundary layers @xcite , where it affects the functional form of the profile @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of plumes and other structures has been investigated in the context of rb flows @xcite because of their contribution to the heat transport @xcite .",
    "the presence of instabilities is connected with a transition that also marks the entry into the ultimate regime @xcite .",
    "experiments by @xcite show that the flow in the transition region can be spatially localized and transient , very much as in the case of the bypass transition in shear flows .",
    "a quantitative study focusing on the hydrodynamic instabilities in heated boundary layers does not seem to have been published .",
    "the manner in which shear and buoyancy interact to shape the transition has been studied by @xcite for the case of rb with a linear shear .",
    "they identified the onset of modulated rolls and the transition to a subcritical regime when the shear was strong and the temperature gradient weak .",
    "ultimately , this state could be traced to an exact coherent structure ( ecs ) in plane couette flow that is related to the transition in the pure shear flow without a temperature gradient .",
    "the ecs reached via heating coincides with the one obtained by adding rotation as a destabilizing force @xcite . using these and related embeddings as well as some other techniques @xcite ,",
    "numerous exact coherent structures have been identified in plane couette flow @xcite , in pipe flow @xcite , in plane poiseuille flow @xcite and even in boundary layers @xcite . for these flows the observed transient subcritical turbulence",
    "could be explained by ecs which create a chaotic saddle in a series of bifurcations @xcite .",
    "further studies have shown that ecs are linked dynamically @xcite and embedded in the turbulent dynamics @xcite .    the asymptotic suction boundary layer ( asbl ) @xcite is a boundary layer that is of interest on its own because of its relation to flow control since suction stabilizes the boundary layer .",
    "it is also of theoretical interest since the flow is parallel and can hence be studied using the tools developed for parallel shear flows .",
    "experimental realizations of both the pure shear flow @xcite and the heated version @xcite are available . taking the cross flow as a parameter",
    ", the ecs from plane couette flow could be traced to asbl , and a transition in the dynamics could be identified @xcite .",
    "further ecs for asbl , in the form of travelling waves and periodic orbits , have been identified and studied @xcite .",
    "we here expand the analysis of the asbl to include heating of the bottom plate , so as to form a thermal asymptotic suction boundary layer ( tasbl ) .",
    "the study of such a parallel tasbl contributes to our understanding of the turbulence transition and the dynamics of coherent structures in thermal boundary layers .",
    "the further outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the system and its laminar solution .",
    "the stability of the base flow as function of rayleigh number , reynolds number , and prandtl number and the two - dimensional secondary solutions bifurcating from the laminar state are discussed in section 3 . in section [ secsubchaos ] examples of the cascade of bifurcations that lead to a chaotic saddle and subcritical chaos in the system",
    "are studied .",
