    "galaxy clusters are the most massive virialized systems in our universe , whose gravitational potential wells are dominated by dark matter that accounts for up to about 90% of the total mass . except for the gravity , however , the interaction between dark matter and its luminous counterparts is extraordinary small ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus nearly all of the contemporary studies of clusters have been performed via observing the luminous components , i.e. , highly ionized intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , stellar component , as well as various warm and cool gases , with an emphasis in the x - ray band since the icm overwhelms other luminous components in mass by a fact of a few ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the temperature of the icm , which can be directly measured in space - borne observations , is a fundamental quantity that can be used to either characterize the thermodynamic status of the icm , or calculate the total gravitating mass and various x - ray scaling relations @xcite , or interpret the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also provides us with valuable information about astrophysical processes such as agn feedback , thermal conduction , merger , and radiative cooling .",
    "moreover , the knowledge about the icm temperature also helps constrain the parameters of our cosmological models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "apparently , in order to carry out physical study of a cluster , an accurate determination of the icm temperature and its spatial variation within a significant part of the virial radius is crucial . as a standard procedure , after the best - fit gas temperatures obtained for the spectra extracted from a set of adjacent annular or pie regions , both interpolation within each of these regions and extrapolation to larger radii are necessary to obtain a smooth gas temperature profile due to the limited capacity of today s instruments .",
    "this invokes a relatively simple and , if possible , universal analytic expression for the temperature profile . as one of the first attempts",
    ", @xcite analyzed the _",
    "chandra _ pointing observations of seven relaxed clusters , which are located within a redshift range of @xmath4 , and proposed a 4-parameter empirical profile for the radial distribution of gas temperature . using _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data , different but similar temperature profiles were introduced by , e.g. , @xcite to calculate the total gravitating mass of 13 low - redshift relaxed clusters , @xcite to determine the x - ray scaling relations of 14 distant x - ray luminosity , and @xcite to probe the origin of the cold fronts in the icm .",
    "these profiles and their analogs were evaluated and compared with each other by @xcite .    despite the successful applications of the empirical temperature profiles listed above",
    ", the following two questions may still be raised : what is the intrinsic physics behind these empirical profiles and how reliable it is when we extrapolate these profiles out to the skirt region of a cluster ? in this work , we address this issue by analyzing the x - ray data of a sample of 50 galaxy clusters ( @xmath5 ) , which are drawn from _",
    "s 15-year archive , and fitting the observed radial temperature profiles with a physical model that takes into account the effects of gravitational heating during the halo collapse , thermal history ( such as radiative cooling , agn feedback , and thermal conduction ) , and work done via gas compression . in  2 and  3",
    ", we describe the sample selection criteria and data analysis , respectively . in  4 , we introduce the model and use it to fit the observed temperature profiles . in  5 , we select nine clusters that have been observed with _ suzaku _ out to or even beyond @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is defined as the radius within which the mean enclosed mass density of the target is 500 times the critical density of the universe at the target s redshift ) , extrapolate the best - fit _",
    "temperature profiles obtained with our new model to @xmath6 and compare the results with the _ suzaku _ measurements .",
    "we also discuss the applicability of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption and the constraint on the non - gravitational interaction between dark and luminous matters . in  6 , we summarize our results . throughout the work we adopt a flat @xmath8cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and hubble constant @xmath11 . unless stated otherwise , we used the solar abundance standards of @xcite and quote errors at 68% confidence level .",
    "in order to measure and characterize the spatial distribution of gas temperature in a galaxy cluster , both a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and a balance between sufficient angular resolution and complete detector coverage of the target are necessary . to this end , we constructed our _ chandra _  sample by applying the following selection criteria : ( 1 ) a large part of the target out to at least @xmath0 is fully or nearly fully covered by either the s3 ccd or the i0 - 3 ccds of the _ chandra _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) instrument , ( 2 ) the number of photons contained inside @xmath0 is no less than 12500 cts , and ( 3 ) the target exhibits a relatively regular appearance and possesses no significant substructures . as a result we drew 50 clusters from the _ chandra _  archive , whose redshifts , average temperatures ( see  3.3 ) , and x - ray luminosities span ranges of @xmath12 , @xmath13 kev , and @xmath14 erg @xmath15 , respectively ( table [ sample_tot ] ) .    for each observation",
    ", we followed the standard _",
    "chandra _  data processing procedure to prepare the data by using ciao v4.4 and caldb v4.4.8 , by starting with the acis level 1 event files , which were collected with a frame time of 3.2 s telemetered in the faint or vfaint mode .",
    "we removed all bad pixels and columns , as well as events with _",
    "grades 1 , 5 , and 7 and carried out corrections for the gain , charge transfer inefficiency ( for the observations performed after january 30 , 2000 ) , astrometry , and cosmic ray afterglow . by examining the light curves extracted in @xmath16 kev from source - free regions or regions less contaminated by the sources on the s3 or i0 - 3 ccds , we identified and excluded time intervals contaminated by occasional particle background flares during which the count rate rises to @xmath17 of the mean value .",
    "when available , data of s1 ccd were also analyzed to cross check the determination of the contaminated intervals .",
    "all the point sources detected beyond the @xmath18 threshold in the acis images with ciao tools * celldetect * and * wavedetect * have been masked in the analysis .",
    "in order to construct the local background of each observation , we extract the spectrum from one or several separate boundary regions on the s3 ccd or i0 - 3 ccds , where the thermal emission of the cluster is relatively weak but usually can not be neglected , and fit the extracted spectrum in @xmath19 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) with a model that consists of an absorbed thermal apec component ( the absorption is fixed to the galactic value given in @xcite ; @xcite , and the abundance is set to @xmath20 @xmath21 if it is not well constrained ; e.g. , @xcite ) , an absorbed power - law component for the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ; @xmath22 ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , a galactic emission component ( two apec components with @xmath23 and @xmath24 kev , respectively ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and a particle - induced hard component calculated from the corresponding _ chandra _",

    "the background template employed in this work , i.e. , galactic + cxb + particle components , can be determined after the best - fit is achieved .",
    "when available , we also cross checked our background templates with the @xmath25 kev _ rosat _  all - sky survey ( rass ) diffuse background maps , where the particle component is minor , and obtained consistent results . in order to approximate the field - to - field variation of the galactic and cxb background components in each observation , in the imaging and spectral analysis that follows",
    "we estimate the model parameter errors by taking into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties ( 10% ; @xcite ) in the background .      in order to calculate the azimuthally averaged gas temperature distributions of the sample clusters , for each observation",
    ", we extract the _ chandra _  acis spectra from @xmath26 concentric annuli , which are all centered on the x - ray peak and cover the @xmath27 .",
    "the width of each annulus is determined in such a way that a minimal photon count of 2500 cts in @xmath28 kev is guaranteed , while in the outmost annulus the condition that the photon count is at least twice the background is simultaneously satisfied .",
    "we perform the spectral model fittings by employing the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec v12.8.2 ( @xcite ) , and limit the fittings in @xmath28 kev to minimize the effect of the instrumental background at higher energies and the calibration uncertainties at lower energies .    in the spectral analysis we use the xspec model projct to evaluate the influence of the outer spherical shells on the inner ones , and",
    "fit the deprojected spectra by applying the optically thin thermal plasma model apec ( @xcite ) , which is absorbed by the foreground photoelectric absorption model wabs . for each cluster , the column density @xmath29 of the wabs model",
    "is fixed to the corresponding galactic value ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the redshift of the apec component is fixed to the value given in literature , which can be found in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) . whenever the metal abundance of the hot gas is not well constrained , we fix it to 0.3 @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the innermost annulus",
    ", we also attempt to add an additional absorbed apec component to represent the possible cooler phase gas , the origin of which is often ascribed to the central dominating galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) . when the f - test shows that the fitting is improved at the 90% confidence level , we choose to use the two - phase gas model and define the temperature of the intergalactic gas as that of the hot phase .",
    "the obtained gas temperature distributions are shown in figure 1 , along with the errors calculated at 68 % confidences level .",
    "we extract the x - ray surface brightness profiles @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the two dimensional radius ) in @xmath28 kev from a set of concentric annular bins that are all centered at the x - ray peak of the gas halo , and correct them by applying the exposure maps to remove the effect of vignetting and exposure time fluctuations .",
    "the exposure maps are created using the spectral weights calculated for an incident thermal gas spectrum that possesses the same average temperature and metal abundance as the cluster (  @xmath32 ) .",

    "we show the physical properties of clusters in table [ sample_info ] .",
    "in this section we attempt to introduce an universal profile to describe the observed gas temperature profiles by taking account the effects of both gravity and non - gravitational processes , the latter includes the polytropic compression and thermal history ( such as radiative cooling , agn feedback , and thermal conduction ) of the gas . for a small test gas element ,",
    "whose position , mass , and particle number density are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively , we mark the gravitational energy released during the halo collapse as @xmath60 , and the energy transferred to it by the non - gravitational processes as @xmath61 . thus the total energy available to increase the internal energy of the test gas element is expressed as @xmath62    _ energy released in the gravitational collapse _ + first let us consider the gravitational energy release of the test gas element during the collapse of the cluster . as in  [ masscal ] , we assume that at present time the gravitational potential of the system can be described by the nfw model @xcite .",

    "we find that within @xmath6 ( roughly @xmath137 ) of seven clusters our model profiles are in good agreement with the _ suzaku _ measurements at the 68% confidence level .",
    "for a1835 the model prediction is higher than the _ suzaku _  measurement in @xmath138 , where a break on the observed gas entropy distribution is detected against the theoretical power - law distribution .",
    "this is an indication of the appearance of additional cooler gas , which can be associated with contacting regions between the cluster and large - scale structure environment @xcite . for a2029",
    "our model underestimates the _ suzaku _  temperatures in @xmath139 @xmath7 , which might be due to substructures of the cluster .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium has been widely assumed in x - ray imaging spectroscopic analysis of galaxy clusters because , e.g. , by adopting this assumption , the projection effect can be well restricted in measuring the x - ray mass , meanwhile the scatter of x - ray mass measurements is about a factor of two smaller than that of the lensing masses .",
    "however , both observations and simulations show that the x - ray mass measurements are generally biased low by @xmath140 due to violation of the hydrostatic equilibrium due to mergers and bulk motions of the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , especially in the skirt regions .",
    "when this violation occurs , we may employ the efficiency factor @xmath96 introduced in  4.1 to describe the degree of the violation as @xmath141 , which is typical @xmath142 inside @xmath143 and increases to @xmath144 at @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "in our model fittings of the _ chandra _  temperature profiles of the sample clusters (  4.2 ) , we usually obtain @xmath146 at small and intermediate radii , whereas @xmath147 reaches to @xmath148 at @xmath7 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "if we force @xmath149 throughout the cluster , we will obtain gas temperatures much higher than the observation in @xmath150 in some cases .",
    "as an example in figure 3 we show the model predicted temperature profiles for the nine clusters discussed in  5.1 ( light blue solid lines ) when @xmath149 is set . in three clusters ( a1835 , a2142 , and pks 0745 - 191 ) the model profiles significantly deviate from the observed data , indicating that in these clusters the hydrostatic equilibrium is not well established in @xmath151 . for the rest six clusters , however , such a deviation is not seen in @xmath152 or even in @xmath153 within the error ranges .",
    "these results imply that for these clusters the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is safe at small and intermediate radii .",
    "the non - gravitational interactions between dark matter and luminous matter are expected to be very weak , therefore the kinetic energy of the dark matter can hardly be transferred to the hot gas . to test this we modify our model by adding a new free parameter @xmath154 to describe the percentage of the dark matter s kinetic energy that has been transfered to the gas . assuming that the baryonic fraction of the total gravitating mass is 16% , the model temperature profile eq .",

    "this is accordant with the measurement results by astronomical simulation @xcite and particle physics experiments @xcite , which in turn verify the model .",
    "we investigate the gas temperature profiles in a sample of 50 clusters observed with _",
    "chandra _  by introducing a new temperature profile model , which takes into account the effects of both the gravitational heating , thermal history ( such as radiative cooling , agn feedback , and thermal conduction ) and work done via gas compression , and use it to fit the observed temperature profiles by running bayesian regressions . in all cases our model can provide an acceptable fit at the 68% confidence level .",
