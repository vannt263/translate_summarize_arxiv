    "the iridium @xmath6-pyrochlore family of compounds , a@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 , spans a broad spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties that make them prime candidates for the exploration of complex phenomena in solid state chemistry and physics @xcite .",
    "the crystalline structure of this family is face - centered cubic with space group @xmath9 ( s. g. 227 ) , that can be described as two interpenetrated sublattices , a@xmath7o2 and ir@xmath7o1@xmath10 . in a@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8",
    "the ir atoms form the 3d equivalent of a kagome structure .",
    "when the a cation is a rare - earth ( re ) element , the effective magnetic moment agrees with the expected value for the re@xmath11 ions , indicating its localized nature @xcite .",
    "all of the a@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 ( a = re ) compounds have weiss temperatures @xmath12 corresponding to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and none of their moments exhibits magnetic ordering at temperatures well below the @xmath12 value ( down to 0.3 k ) @xcite .",
    "systems with a nonmagnetic a - cation have been reported ; y@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 is a mott insulator with a small ferromagnetic component below 170 k , as a consequence of either a spin - glass ordering or spin canting @xcite .",
    "when y is partially substituted by bi , y@xmath13bi@xmath14ir@xmath7o@xmath8 , experimental data of transport properties indicate a metal - insulator transition at @xmath15 0.5 @xcite . in the solid solution y@xmath13ca@xmath16ir@xmath7o@xmath8 , in which y and ca are nonmagnetic but have different oxidation states , partial substitution of y changes the electrical and magnetic properties substantially ; a metallic behavior appears when @xmath17 , also the ferromagnetism ( transition temperature at 170 k ) disappears @xcite .",
    "recently weak magnetic frustration has been proposed to occur in eu@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this compound presents an interesting case of a magnetic frustrated system , in which eu@xmath11 is a @xmath18 nonmagnetic cation and only the ir@xmath19 electrons contribute to magnetism in this compound , in which a metal - insulator / af transition is reported at 120 k @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of localized magnetic moments and a @xmath20 cation is an unexpected situation , since the ir@xmath21 wave functions should result in a metallic conduction via ir - derived bands @xcite .",
    "poor metals such as rincu@xmath22 ( r = gd , dy , ho ) @xcite and the cd doped system ( rin@xmath23cd@xmath16cu@xmath22 , r = gd - tm ) @xcite , behave as frustrated systems . in the latter system",
    ", long - range interactions introduced into the system by the conduction electrons are thought that they reduce the magnetic frustration . in itinerant electron systems the exchange interactions",
    "are not restricted to nearest neighbors and magnetic order can occur if the magnetic interactions are large enough ; in this situation the mechanism is via the rkky interaction @xcite .",
    "the bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath24-pyrochlore was first reported by bouchard and gillon @xcite and later structurally analyzed by b. j. kennedy @xcite .",
    "this is a metallic system in which no magnetic transition has been reported .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility is curie - weiss - like ( cw ) , however a detailed analysis that explains the magnetic behavior has not been completely done .",
    "the metallic character in the y@xmath0bi@xmath25ir@xmath7o@xmath8 system shows a bi - content dependence @xcite , and we recently showed @xcite that in this type of compounds the main contributors at the fermi energy @xmath26 are ir and o1 atoms . in the present work we report the effect of bi substitution by sr on the magnetic behavior of bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 ( bi@xmath0sr@xmath25ir@xmath7o@xmath27 .",
    "this substitution is also accompanied by important changes in the local geometry around ir @xcite .",
    "the system studied here shows an enhanced paramagnetism that can be described by a modified curie - weiss ( mcw ) equation in which short - range magnetic interactions are taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "the pauli magnetic susceptibility decreases with the sr content and this should be indicative of a similar tendency of the electronic density of states at the fermi energy @xmath28 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of bi@xmath0sr@xmath25ir@xmath7o@xmath8 were prepared by solid state reaction with stoichiometric amounts of iro@xmath7 , bi@xmath7o@xmath29 and srco@xmath29 powders .",
    "details of syntheses and structure analysis can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "dc magnetization data were acquired with a squid magnetometer ( mpms , quantum design ) in a temperature range between 2 and 300 k. field cooling mode measurements were performed under a magnetic field of 0.1 t for all samples .",
    "in bi@xmath0sr@xmath25ir@xmath7o@xmath8 a monotonous increase of the cubic lattice parameter is observed as a function of the strontium content , @xmath30 , which is in agreement with the difference between the sr@xmath31 and bi@xmath11 ionic radii ( sr@xmath32  and bi@xmath33  , both in 8-coordination @xcite .",
    "additionally , a linear reduction of the ir - o1 bond distance was observed as consequence of the steric effect associated with the increase in the oxidation state of the ir cation and the repulsive effect due to the larger sr radius @xcite .",
    "these structural modifications were earlier predicted by koo et al .",
    "@xcite in terms of the coordination environment of the o1 atom .",
    "when a divalent cation is included into the a@xmath34b@xmath35o@xmath8 @xmath6-pyrochlore lattice to form an aliovalent solid solution , a charge - compensation process is expected to occur by the appearance of a positive charged lattice defect @xcite .",
    "this charge - compensation can be considered through the krger - vink notation @xcite . according to the chemical reaction ,",
    "in the localized defects scheme , there are three possible consequences resulting from the bi by sr substitution :    @xmath36{bi_2ir_2o_7 } sr''_{ir } + v^{\\bullet\\bullet}_0 + iro_2\\ ] ]    @xmath37{bi_2ir_2o_7 } 2sr'_{bi } + v^{\\bullet\\bullet}_0 + bi_2o_3\\ ] ]    @xmath38{bi_2ir_2o_7 } sr'_{bi } + o^{x}_0 + ir^{\\bullet}_{ir}\\ ] ]    when sr@xmath31 is incorporated into the bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 lattice it could occupy an ir@xmath21 or bi@xmath11 site , with the consequent generation of an oxygen vacancy and the corresponding metal oxide ( iro@xmath7 and bi@xmath7o@xmath29 , schottky reactions 1 and 2 ) . an additional effect related with the incorporation of sr@xmath31 at the bi@xmath11 site",
    "is associated with a change of the oxidation state of ir ( reaction 3 ) .",
    "considering the oxygen occupation values obtained from the rietveld analysis @xcite , it is possible to think that schottky reactions could happen , however the corresponding bismuth or iridium oxides were not found in the diffraction patterns as products of such reaction . it should be pointed out that the prolonged time of the solid - state reaction could lead to evaporation and disproportionation of the iridium - oxide , releasing oxygen @xcite . on the basis of the experimental results ,",
    "it is clear that reaction 3 is being preferred but is difficult to accurately determine the oxygen content of samples .",
    "magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature of bi@xmath13sr@xmath16ir@xmath7o@xmath8 .",
    "the inset shows a magnification of the low temperature region . ]",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath25ir@xmath7o@xmath8 compounds with the @xmath30-compositions 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 0.9 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "all susceptibility data were corrected for core diamagnetism @xcite .",
    "as can be observed in this figure , none of the samples showed a magnetic transition , at least down to 2 k , and the magnetic susceptibility diminishes as the sr content increases .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility reduction can be explained in terms of a change in the oxidation state of the ir atoms , since ir is the only magnetic cation present in the bi@xmath0sr@xmath25ir@xmath7o@xmath8 series .",
    "the coordination environment around the ir cation in the @xmath6-pyrochlore crystal lattice is a distorted octahedron in the form of a trigonal antiprism ( ta ) @xcite , that is , the lattice is distorted in the [ 111 ] direction . as a consequence , from the @xmath39(@xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) regular octahedron splitting , now @xmath39 splits into @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a new coordinate system with @xmath47 in the [ 111 ] direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the bands are wide @xcite and the @xmath48 splitting for the studied system is considerably smaller .",
    "thus , in the crystal field scheme , the electron configuration of ir@xmath21 is [ xe]@xmath49 , with a spin magnetic moment @xmath50 . in this way",
    "the explanation of the magnetic susceptibility reduction as a function of the sr content is that the inclusion of sr in trivalent cation positions ( bi ) , produces a partial oxidation of iridium atoms from ir@xmath21 to ir@xmath5 .",
    "the ir@xmath5 produced to achieve electroneutrality has an electron configuration [ xe]@xmath51 , with @xmath52 , therefore it would not contribute to the magnetic susceptibility @xcite , and the susceptibility of the compounds is due to the remaining ir@xmath21 @xcite ; consequently , magnetic susceptibility of samples should diminish as is experimentally found .",
    "in contrast , in an octahedral crystal field splitting ( low spin ) , ir@xmath21 has @xmath50 ( the same that for ta splitting ) , but ir@xmath5 has @xmath53 . the experimental measurement of magnetization seems to point to the existence of nonmagnetic ir@xmath5 , which increases as a function of the sr content , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "several other pyrochlore systems containing ir@xmath5 have previously been reported , in which the ir valence was stated by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) @xcite and x - ray absorption near edge spectroscopy ( xanes ) @xcite .    in order to explain in detail the magnetic behavior of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 system ,",
    "a first approximation was done fitting the susceptibility data to the cw equation , @xmath54 .",
    "this fit was performed for the high temperature region but the @xmath55 and @xmath12 values are not congruent with those expected for a paramagnet .",
    "all samples of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 series show metallic behavior , but at a fixed temperature , for a bigger sr - content corresponds a larger resistivity . the metallic conductivity and non cw behavior is not exclusive of magnetic compounds crystallizing in the @xmath6-pyrochlore structure , this has also been observed in iron pnictides @xcite and la@xmath13sr@xmath16cuo@xmath22 systems @xcite .",
    "likewise , short - range magnetic interactions between rare earth ions on the a site of magnetic pyrochlores have been reported in r@xmath7ru@xmath7o@xmath8 ( r = tb , er and yb ) @xcite.therefore , it is necessary to consider short - range magnetic order and spin fluctuations @xcite in the interpretation of the magnetic behavior of bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 .",
    "inverse of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath56 of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 as a function of temperature .",
    "the dashed lines represent a linear fitting of data above 100 k. the continuous lines represent the data fitting using the modified curie - weiss equation , see text . ]",
    "based on the theoretical expressions deduced by opechowski and li , in which the short - range magnetic order effects are included in power series of @xmath57 @xcite , a mcw equation was tried to fit the observed magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "the @xmath58 term could be associated with the @xmath12 value in the curie - weiss model when @xmath50 , since @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the exchange integral and @xmath61 is the spin coordination number .",
    "additionally , a phenomenological linear temperature term @xmath62 was included .",
    "the modified cw equation is @xcite ; @xmath63-\\theta } \\label{mcw}\\ ] ]    the parameters obtained with the mcw fitting are shown in table 1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that when an equation such as @xmath64 was tried , the fitting was not satisfactory , especially in the low temperature region , @xmath65100 k. even though all samples exhibit a paramagnetic behavior in the 2 - 300 k range , a noticeable deviation from the linearity in @xmath56 is observed for the low temperature region .",
    "this departure goes to lower temperatures as the sr content increases .",
    "the further from ir@xmath21 towards ir@xmath5 , the larger is the fitting range to the cw equation .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of the magnetic susceptibility fitting obtained with the equation [ mcw ] show that the @xmath6 term is small when it is compared with @xmath66 , but this phenomenological term is necessary to obtain a good adjustment of the experimental data and also permits a suitable interpretation of @xmath55 and @xmath12 .",
    "if the conventional procedure to determine @xmath55 and @xmath12 from magnetic susceptibility data had been used , that is , extrapolating @xmath56 @xmath67 .",

    "the small negative values obtained for @xmath12 with equation [ mcw ] suggest a weak af coupling in all samples of this solid solution .",
    "no magnetic transition was observed , if this transition exists , it might occur at temperature below 2 k. very recently , qi et al . reported the magnetic and thermal behavior of bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 single - crystal .",
    "they showed that in the range 0.05 - 350 k there are no anomalies indicating long - range order , and found that @xmath79 ( emu / mole ) , @xmath80 k and a @xmath81ir and the magnetic susceptibility of that sample noticeably differs from that of the cw equation @xcite .    since the cell - parameter of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 solid solution behaves according to the vegard s law , then knowing the ionic radii of bi@xmath11 ( 1.17 , cn=8 ) , sr@xmath31 ( 1.26 , cn=8 ) , ir@xmath21 ( 0.625 , cn=6 ) and ir@xmath5 ( 0.57 , cn=6 ) ( cn is the coordination number ) @xcite an approximation of the ir@xmath5 content can be obtained .",
    "this procedure is better than that using the ir - o bond - distances @xcite , since these values are influenced by the effect of bi substitution by sr , mentioned above @xcite . using this approximation the ir@xmath21 atomic fractions , @xmath82 , in samples",
    "were calculated .",
    "the ir@xmath21 atomic fractions reported in this work agree well with the oxygen occupation factors from previous rietveld refinements results @xcite .",
    "the difference between the stoichiometric sr value , @xmath30 , and the ir@xmath5 content of samples to preserve electroneutrality , can be attributed to the oxygen deficiencies of samples @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 term of the equation [ mcw ] can be interpreted as the effective magnetic moment per magnetic ion , @xmath77 . according to equation [ mcw ] , and taking into account the remaining ir@xmath21 content ,",

    ", @xmath77 corresponds to 76% of the expected value for @xmath50 in a ta geometry , however , in y@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 , which is magnetically similar to bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 , fukazawa et al .",
    "@xcite report 14% of the expected value with @xmath50 .",
    "this difference could be associated with oxygen or iridium vacancies , because in both compounds the atomic distances ir - o1 and bond angles ir - o1-ir are similar . moreover , the @xmath77 values of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 system indicate that with increasing the sr@xmath31 content , the effective magnetic moment diminishes until it reaches 8.1% of the expected value , at @xmath84 .",
    "ir-@xmath77 values smaller than the expected value of 1.73 @xmath85 @xcite have been reported for several ir compounds , these values range from 0.13 to 0.69 @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "one explanation of this small value of @xmath77 is attributed to the strong spin - orbit coupling of @xmath86 cations and the strong exchange interactions that lower the magnetization of samples @xcite . in the case of eu@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8",
    ", muon spin rotation and relaxation experiments did not suffice to provide the magnetic structure of such compound , furthermore neutron scattering measurements result prohibitively difficult because of the high neutron absorption cross section of ir nucleus @xcite .    as can be observed from [ fig2 ] , the magnetic measurements the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath7o@xmath8 solid solution , rather than being the result of a type of magnetic alignment of moments under an applied magnetic field ( paramagnetic gas ) , they seem to show the effect of short - range magnetic interactions , which , prevailing at the whole 2 - 300 k temperature range , are not capable to condensate into a large - range af state . in this way , while no noticeable variation of the @xmath12 value dependent of the sr content is observed , there is a clear departure from the cw behavior that can be associated with short - range interactions , especially in the low temperature region .",
    "for @xmath870 and 0.1 the calculated magnetic moments are 1.23 and 1.02 @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "these values agree well with those reported for ir@xmath21 in eu@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 ( 1.1 @xmath88 ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "the tendency of @xmath66 to diminish with the sr content could have origin in two different processes . on one hand",
    ", one could think of a reduction of the @xmath28 associated to the appearance of ir@xmath5 . however , according to previous results @xcite of dft density of states calculation for bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 and bisrir@xmath7o@xmath8 , these @xmath28 values are practically insensitive to the sr content . since in both systems",
    "the main contributors to @xmath28 are ir and o1 ( 95% in bi@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath8 and 96.5% in bisrir@xmath7o@xmath8 ) , ir@xmath5 is not expected to be the main responsible for this diminishing in the @xmath66 values . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that , associated to the @xmath20 electronic configuration and the local geometry of ir@xmath21 , a strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has been pointed out as responsible of spectacular electronic properties in localized @xcite and metallic systems @xcite .",

    "as shown in table 1 , @xmath66 decreases as the sr content ; as the electrical resistivity value as a function of the sr content remains in the same order , we can roughly assume that @xmath28 has no noticeable variation and @xmath101 has a small dependence with the sr content . in this way @xmath93",
    "is expected to decrease as @xmath94 and the electron - electron correlation would decrease as the sr content .",
    "we could suppose that such decrease is associated to the presence of ir@xmath5 and that such electronic correlation can be either originated in the soc ( anticipated for all the @xmath20 electronic systems ) or to short - range correlations of magnetic electrons .",

    "<S> the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the bi@xmath0sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3 system was studied from 2 to 300 k. according to these measurements , the solid solution @xmath4 does not show any magnetic transition ; however , a noticeable deviation from the curie - weiss law occurs and the magnetic behavior of this system can be ascribed to short - range magnetic order that is also present in several geometrically frustrated systems . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli magnetic susceptibility decreases as the sr content increases , this can be associated with a shift towards ir@xmath5 in samples ; also the ir effective magnetic moment decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated wilson - ratio indicates the presence of strong electron - electron correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> pyrochlore oxides , iridiates , short - range magnetic order . </S>"
