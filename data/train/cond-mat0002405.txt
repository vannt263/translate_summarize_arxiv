    "recently , there has been much interest in the study of quantum dots , which are structures in which the charge carriers are confined in all three dimensions .",
    "especially the self - assembled quantum dots @xcite are considered to be very promising for possible applications , such as quantum dot lasers @xcite , due to their large confinement energy and high optical quality .",
    "the dots are formed by the stranski - krastanow growth mode in which a material , e.g. @xmath2 , is deposited on another material with a substantially different lattice parameter , e.g. @xmath3 @xcite@xmath4 the lattice mismatch , which is required for this growth process , is typically about @xmath5 @xcite@xmath4 initially , the growth is two dimensional , but after a critical thickness of a few monolayers , coherent islands are formed due to strain effects .",
    "the shape of the formed islands is not well known , but is expected to resemble a lens or a pyramid .",
    "the density , size and shape of the dots are strongly dependent on the growth conditions .",
    "typical sizes of dots vary between the basis size of 7 to 20@xmath6 and a height of a few nanometers .",
    "the density of the dots is of the order 10@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the properties of confined excitons have been the subject of many theoretical studies .",
    "bryant @xcite used variational and configuration - interaction representations to study excitons in quantum boxes .",
    "later , matrix diagonalization techniques were used to study the exciton energy in a quantum dot with parabolic confinement potential .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of non circular symmetric structures , and halonen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite  studied the influence of a magnetic field .",
    "more recently , pereyra _ et al .",
    "_ @xciteinvestigated magnetic field and quantum confinement asymmetry effects on excitons , again for the case of parabolic confinement .",
    "these studies have shown a strong competition between the quantum dot size , coulomb interaction and magnetic confinement .    in the present work ,",
    "we approximate the quantum dots by a quantum disk with a hard - wall confinement of finite height @xcite , as found in self - assembled quantum dots , and include the mass mismatch between the dot and barrier material .",
    "we present a theoretical study of the effect of an external magnetic field on the properties of an exciton in the quantum disk , fully taking into account the coulomb interaction between the electron and the hole .",
    "the groundstate energy and binding energy of the exciton are studied as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to determine the diamagnetic shift of the exciton , which we find in very good agreement with the experimentally observed shift by wang _",
    "_ @xcite . in most of the previous theoretical work ,",
    "this diamagnetic shift was only determined for very low values of the magnetic field , where the confinement energy is larger than the cyclotron energy , and could be approximated by @xmath8 @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "we consider magnetic fields up to 40@xmath9 for such large magnetic fields , the weak field approximation is no longer valid , because now the cyclotron energy overcomes the confinement energy and the particles will act rather as free particles in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we find that the magnetic field dependence of the diamagnetic shift can be very closely approximated by @xmath10 . to be able to make a valid comparison between theory and experiment , we considered for our simulations @xmath11 quantum dots , which were experimentally studied by wang _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the theoretical model and explain our method of solution . the results for the exciton groundstate and the comparison with the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we describe the effect of changing the disk radius on the exciton energy and diamagnetic shift .",
    "the results for the exciton energy spectrum are presented in sec . v.",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian describing our system is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 where the indices @xmath14 correspond to the electron and the hole with masses @xmath15 , respectively , @xmath16 ( otherwise ) is the confinement potential with @xmath17 the radius of the quantum disk and @xmath18 its thickness , @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 here and below the upper and lower sign correspond to electron and hole , respectively .",
    "for convenience we will sometimes also use the notations @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 we allow for a difference in mass between the dot region and the region outside the dot : @xmath24 inside the disk and @xmath25 outside the disk . in our numerical work , we used the following values for the physical parameters : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 which are typical for the @xmath32 system .    using cylindrical coordinates @xmath33 the one - particle hamiltonian takes the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the electron and hole cyclotron frequencies and the vector potential is taken in the symmetrical gauge @xmath36    the one - particle wave functions are separable @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular momentum , and the wave functions @xmath39 are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath40 where the index @xmath41 denotes the eigenenergies of @xmath42 as a consequence of the axial symmetry of our problem , there is no coupling between the wave functions with different values of the total angular momentum @xmath43 therefore , we can construct the exciton wave function @xmath44 with fixed total momentum @xmath45 as the linear combination @xmath46 where the functions @xmath47 obey the schrdinger equation @xmath48 with @xmath49 the eigenenergy , for brevity @xmath50 denotes the coordinates @xmath51 @xmath52 is the matrix element of the coulomb interaction @xmath53 @xmath54 is the total number of angular harmonics in the expansion .    a common technique to solve the eigenvalue problem is to use an expansion of the wave function in a suitable set of basis functions .",
    "for the typical sizes of the quantum disks considered here , the exciton binding energy is much smaller than the confinement energy . as a consequence ,",
    "a natural choice is to take the eigenfunctions @xmath55 of the one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "but for our present problem such an approach runs into obstacles because of the enormous number of basis functions which are required to obtain the binding energy with sufficient accuracy . indeed , using the one particle eigenfunctions for different values of the angular momentum @xmath56 and quantum number @xmath57 one has to calculate @xmath58 matrix elements of the hamiltonian . in the present case of hard wall confinement ,",
    "the one dimensional eigenfunctions are too complicated in order to obtain an analytical expression for the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "therefore , a numerical integration procedure has to be used on the space grid with size @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 are the numbers of grid points for the longitudinal and transverse directions , respectively . in principle , the difficulties in the calculation of the coulomb matrix elements can be avoided by applying an appropriate basis , for instance the nonorthogonal gaussian basis , which is widely employed in quantum chemical simulations .",
    "but in this case there is an increase of the number of functions , which are needed , leading to difficulties with diagonalizing a large @xmath62 non - sparse matrix .",
    "note that for an arbitrary basis , the number @xmath63 is determined by the number of one - particle wave functions in the longitudinal ( @xmath64 ) and the radial ( @xmath65 ) directions .",
    "the total number of operations depends crucially on the considered number of subbands @xmath64 in the @xmath66-direction . for a small ratio @xmath67 of the longitudinal to transverse size of the quantum disk",
    "as given before , we can limit ourself by taking only one subband @xcite .      for arbitrary values of the ratio @xmath67",
    "we present a numerical technique based on the use of a finite difference scheme .",
    "let @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 be some nonuniform space grid in the longitudinal and transverse directions for both electron and hole coordinates .",
    "using the appropriate symmetry conditions for the ground wave function in the longitudinal direction @xmath72=@xmath73 we can limit ourselves to the region @xmath74 thus , the first point of the @xmath66-grid corresponds to @xmath75 the upper @xmath76 and right @xmath77 boundaries of the simulation region correspond to the barrier region where the wave function and its derivatives go to zero .",
    "therefore , the neumann conditions @xmath78 @xmath79 are employed for these boundaries . to obtain the finite difference scheme for the one - particle hamiltonian , including the discontinuous behavior of the particles mass and external potential",
    ", we integrate the expression over the square @xmath80 where the subgrids with noninteger indexes are determined by the relations @xmath81 substituting the finite difference expressions for the derivatives of the wave function @xmath82 we obtain the following finite difference scheme for the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath83 with the coefficients @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 due to the discontinuity of the mass and the external potential at the disk boundary , special care must be taken in the choice of the expression for its grid values . in the expressions the averaged value of the masses @xmath88 and potential @xmath89",
    "are determined by the following relations @xmath90=@xmath91",
    "@xmath92=@xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95    once a finite difference hamiltonian @xmath96 has been constructed , we have to develop a technique to obtain the ground state of the sparse matrix @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the unit matrix , index @xmath99 denotes all indexes corresponding to the space grid .",
    "note that the number of non zero elements of the matrix @xmath100 is only proportional to @xmath101 this is a key distinction from the commonly accepted expansion over basis functions , where this number increases as the second power with the number of functions .",
    "however , the size of our matrix is still large and therefore direct diagonalization methods are not suitable for solving our problem .",
    "the best suitable approach to find only the lowest eigenvalue @xmath102 and eigenvector @xmath103 is the inverse iteration method , where the eigenvector @xmath104 at the @xmath105 stage of the iteration is obtained by solving the following equation @xmath106 with the subsequent normalization @xmath107 where the brackets @xmath108 stand for scalar multiplication .",
    "the eigenenergy is obtained in the usual way @xmath109 the value of the parameter @xmath110 is chosen such that a minimum absolute value of the matrix @xmath111 corresponds to the ground state of the matrix @xmath100 .",
    "there exist many numerical relaxation techniques to solve the boundary value problem . using standard methods one has to solve the equation with good precision at each stage of the inverse iteration procedure . here , we propose a new technique , which generalizes in fact the commonly accepted gauss - seidel methods @xcite with inverse iterations .",
    "the value of the eigenvector @xmath104 for the mesh points @xmath112 is obtained by using the following relation @xmath113 where @xmath114 for the ground state @xmath115 we found that the maximum rate of convergency is realized by using the following values of the parameters @xmath116 and@xmath117      for quantum disks with large radius @xmath118 we use the adiabatic approach , a technique which was already successfully applied in refs .  @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "we can write the wavefunction as @xmath119 where @xmath120 corresponds to the groundstate of the longitudinal hamiltonian @xmath121 for electron @xmath122=@xmath123 and hole @xmath122=@xmath124 respectively . since the wave function penetrates only slightly into the barrier region in the radial direction , the longitudinal behavior of the effective masses @xmath125 and the confinement potentials @xmath126 can , to high accuracy , be approximated by @xmath127 @xmath128 then the wave function of the ground state has a simple form inside , @xmath129 and outside , @xmath130 the disk , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 the energy of the groundstate @xmath133 is obtained from the continuity of the wave function and conservation of the current @xmath134 at the boundary @xmath135 substituting expression  ( [ eq19 ] ) into the schrdinger equation and integrating out the @xmath136 coordinates by taking the average @xmath137 we obtain the effective two dimensional hamiltonian @xmath138   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + v_{c}^{\\prime } ( { \\bf \\rho } _ { 1}-{\\bf \\rho } _ { 2})\\text { } ,   \\eqnum{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141@xmath142 and the effective coulomb interaction is @xmath143 using a gaussian shape for the longitudinal wave function of the groundstate , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have obtained an analytical approximation to the effective coulomb potential @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the modified bessel function . for a system with infinite barriers",
    "the value @xmath146 gives the best fit to the effective coulomb potential . as a consequence of the penetration of the electron and hole into the barrier region , the value of @xmath147 increases with decreasing disk thickness .",
    "we have found that for our parameters of the quantum disk , @xmath148 and @xmath149 the value @xmath150 gave the best fit to the results obtained from direct numerical calculation of the effective two - dimensional coulomb potential .",
    "the other parameters of the two - dimensional hamiltonian are @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 where indices @xmath22 correspond to electron and hole , respectively .",
    "the numerical diagonalization technique for the 2d hamiltonian was presented already in ref .",
    "we have calculated the exciton groundstate energy and exciton binding energy as a function of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we used for our simulations the physical parameters of the @xmath11 self - assembled quantum dots , used in the experiment by wang _",
    "the studied disks have a height of @xmath158 and a radius of @xmath159 the other parameters were already given above .",
    "1 shows the probability distribution of the electron ( solid curves ) and hole ( dashed curves ) @xmath160 @xmath161 for the ground state along @xmath162 and perpendicular @xmath163 to the disk under consideration . along the @xmath164-direction ,",
    "the electron and hole are confined within the disk but along the @xmath66-direction , there is appreciable penetration into the barrier material .    in fig .",
    "2 the exciton groundstate energy is plotted as a function of the magnetic field . this groundstate energy is given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the single electron and hole energies , respectively and @xmath168 is the exciton binding energy . the solid curve shows the result of the full 3d treatment of the problem , whereas the dashed and dotted curves are calculated using the adiabatic approximation . for the latter case , we make a distinction between the cases with and without correlation . for the case without correlation",
    ", the coulomb interaction is calculated using the single particle electron and hole wave functions @xmath169 the total exciton wave function was used in order to calculate the energy with correlation @xmath170 figure  2 shows an enhancement of the groundstate energy with increasing magnetic field for all three cases .",
    "the correlation energy , which is given by the difference between the dotted and dashed curve , is @xmath171 for @xmath172 and increases to @xmath173 for @xmath174    the inset shows the exciton binding energy as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "again we see an increase for increasing magnetic field as expected .",
    "this is not surprising , because by applying higher magnetic fields the particles are more confined , they are closer to each other and therefore more tightly bound , which implies an increase of the binding energy .",
    "the assignment of the different curves is the same as for the groundstate energy ( see main figure ) .",
    "note that the inclusion of correlation increases the binding energy at @xmath172 with @xmath175 while the full 3d treatment of the problem further increases the binding energy with @xmath176 .    from our calculation of the exciton groundstate energy , we can easily determine the diamagnetic shift of the exciton , which is defined by @xmath177 the result is shown in fig .  3 , where the curves indicate our calculated results for the three cases , as mentioned above , and the squares are the experimental results , as obtained by wang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . from the comparison between the different approaches and experiment , we notice : 1 ) for @xmath178 all three approaches give practically the same result which agrees perfectly with experiment , 2 ) when @xmath179 is increased above 8@xmath0 the three theoretical approaches have the same qualitative @xmath179-dependence but there are small quantitative differences in the slope of the curves , and 3 ) in the high field regime , i.e. @xmath180 our theoretical results substantially underestimate the experimental result .",
    "the masses used for these calculations were the ones given by wang _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath181 and",
    "it is clear that here the heavy - hole mass was used . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that for a magnetic field normal to the sample plane , the light hole mass should be used . because the dot height is much smaller than the dot radius , heavy hole character is expected in the growth direction for the ground hole state and light hole character for in - plane motion .",
    "therefore , for @xmath179 normal to the sample plane , the light hole mass should be used . including the effects of strain , they find for @xmath182 dots that @xmath183 and @xmath184 combining this with values for @xmath185 @xcite , we find by linear interpolation to the material @xmath11 values of @xmath186 and @xmath187 for respectively the electron and the hole mass .",
    "the result for the diamagnetic shift in this case is depicted as the dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "this result is in very good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "in previous theoretical work , only the exciton energy and wave function at @xmath188 were considered , from which the diamagnetic shift can be calculated as @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 is the mean quadratic electron - hole distance .",
    "this is a good approximation in case of low magnetic fields , when the magnetic confinement is much lower than the confinement due to the quantum dot .",
    "however , for higher magnetic fields , the magnetic confinement becomes more important .",
    "then the quadratic dependence of the energy shift on the magnetic field will change into a linear dependence , due to the formation of landau levels . in this case",
    "the energy shift becomes @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the cyclotron frequency . with this knowledge",
    ", one can construct the function @xmath194 which interpolates between the small and large magnetic field behaviour and where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are taken as fitting parameters .",
    "this formula gives for low magnetic fields @xmath197 the already known expression @xmath198 and for high magnetic fields @xmath199 @xmath200 it turns out that eq .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) gives an extremely good fit to the numerical results of fig .  3 for @xmath201 and @xmath202 we found that the fitted curve reproduces the solid curve in fig .",
    "3 so well that they can not be discriminated .",
    "we also calculated @xmath195 using the expression @xmath203 for @xmath204 which resulted into the value @xmath205 this value is substantially higher than the one found by fitting .",
    "in the other limit , we compare @xmath206 with @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the effective exciton mass in @xmath209 .",
    "such a calculation gives @xmath210 which is smaller than the fitted value @xmath211 the fitted results within the adiabatic approximation with and without correlation are respectively , @xmath212 @xmath213 and @xmath214 @xmath215 .",
    "using the light hole mass instead of the heavy hole mass , we find respectively the following fitted and calculated results : @xmath216 @xmath217 and @xmath218 @xmath219    in the above calculations we investigated the adiabatic shift , which is a relative quantity , and therefore in the calculation of the groundstate energy , the bandgap was not included .",
    "but when we want to compare the experimental excitation energy , the bandgap of the disk material is needed . for @xmath172 , using the heavy hole mass , we found a groundstate energy of @xmath220 using eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) . for the case of the light hole mass , which gave a better agreement with the experimental results , the groundstate energy at @xmath172 is @xmath221 to obtain the total excitation energy , as measured in photoluminescence experiments , e.g. by wang _",
    "@xcite , the bandgap energy @xmath102 has to be added to this equation : @xmath222 for our study , we considered @xmath223 quantum dots . without strain ,",
    "the bandgap energy of the dot material was obtained by linear interpolation between the result for @xmath182 ( @xmath224 ) and @xmath185 ( @xmath225 ) which results into @xmath226 whereas we found for the barrier material that @xmath227 @xcite@xmath4 the difference in bandgap between the two materials is @xmath228 for the total exciton energy , we now find @xmath229 using respectively the heavy ( light ) hole mass . from ref .",
    "@xcite , we know that the bandgap difference between the dot and the barrier material , corrected for strain effects , is @xmath230 this means that the bandgap of the dot material has increased with 20@xmath231 for the total exciton energy , this gives us the final result of @xmath232 using the heavy hole mass and @xmath233 using the light hole mass .  in the experiments , for @xmath234",
    "the value of @xmath235 was found , which gives a reasonable agreement with our theoretical result in view of the fact that the composition of the alloy in the dot can , for example , not be uniform , the dot size is not known with high accuracy , etc .",
    "next , we investigated the effect of an applied magnetic field on the exciton characteristics , using the parameters corresponding to the solid curve in fig .",
    "first we considered the one - particle characteristics @xmath236 @xmath237 @xmath238 and @xmath239 where @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 @xmath243 are the electron and hole coordinates along the @xmath66-axis and in the plane , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 and were calculated using the full 3d approach .",
    "the figure shows clearly the squeezing of the exciton due to the magnetic field , especially for the in - plane direction .",
    "the mean quadratic electron - hole separations @xmath244 and @xmath245 give an idea of the size of the exciton .",
    "we defined @xmath246 and @xmath247  notice that the size of the exciton is comparable to the disk size .",
    "we see a more substantial decrease with increasing magnetic field than for the single particle wavefunction , which agrees with the increased binding of the exciton .    in fig .  5 the percentage of the electron ( right scale in fig .  5 ) and",
    "hole ( left scale in fig .",
    "5 ) wavefunction in the dot is shown with varying magnetic field .",
    "both the results for the 2d case with correlation and the full 3d treatment were calculated .",
    "more than @xmath248 of the hole is inside the dot while only @xmath249-@xmath250 of the electron is inside the dot . with increasing magnetic field both the electron and hole",
    "become more confined inside the dot , indicating further the squeezing due to the magnetic field . for the hole",
    ", we observe a flattening of the curve at very high magnetic fields , both for the 3d calculation and for the 2d case . for high magnetic fields ,",
    "the hole wavefunction is in the @xmath164-direction totally confined in the dot .",
    "however , there is still some extent of the wave function outside the dot in the @xmath66-direction .",
    "but since the magnetic field has almost no influence on the @xmath66-direction , applying higher magnetic fields will not attribute to a further increase of the amount of the wavefunction inside the dot and there will always be a small part of the wavefunction outside the dot .",
    "figures  6(a , b ) are contourplots of the density distribution , of the electron and hole , respectively , along a cross section in the middle of the quantum dot perpendicular to the @xmath251-direction",
    ". the electron  density is defined as @xmath252 and similarly for the hole .",
    "the solid curves show the result for the case of @xmath234 whereas the dashed curves are the result for @xmath174 the dashed square indicates the position of the disk , which is only one fourth of the actual disk size . due to the magnetic field",
    ", we see an increase in the density inside the dot , both for electron and hole . along the @xmath164-direction",
    "the particles become more centered in the middle of the dot due to the squeezing by the applied magnetic field .",
    "however in the @xmath66-direction , it seems at first sight that there is an expansion instead of the expected squeezing , but a closer look ( by normalizing the function to its central value ) tells us that this is not the case .",
    "of course , the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath66-axis and has no direct influence on the exciton behaviour in the @xmath66-direction . in the @xmath164-direction",
    "however , the magnetic field brings the electron and hole closer together .",
    "this implies a stronger interaction and we expect that this effect should also be seen in the @xmath66-direction .",
    "this is also the case for the mean quadratic hole @xmath253 and electron - hole separation @xmath254 ( see fig .  4 ) , which decrease as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "we investigated the effect of the size of the disk on the exciton binding energy which is depicted in  fig .  7 for the case with the full 3d treatment , for the parameters corresponding to the solid curve in fig .",
    "3 . when varying the disk radius from @xmath255 up to @xmath256 nm ( the dot thickness was fixed to @xmath257 ) , we see initially a strong increase of the exciton energy by more than a factor 2 and beyond @xmath258 it decreases slowly for increasing @xmath17 . in the ` large ' @xmath17-region , the binding energy increases for decreasing disk radius due to the larger confinement of the electron and hole wavefunction .",
    "the electron and hole are forced to sit closer to each other , which leads to an enhancement of the binding energy .",
    "this behaviour continues until the disk radius reaches a value of @xmath259 where the binding energy reaches a maximum value of @xmath260 .",
    "the decrease in the binding energy with decreasing @xmath17 is due to the fact that the wavefunction of the particles start to spill over into the barrier material , i.e. the electron and the hole become less confined , which leads to a much smaller interaction and therefore a lower binding energy .",
    "this is due to the competition between the confinement kinetic energy and the barrier material potential energy .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .  8 , where the percentage of electron and hole inside the dot is shown as function of the disk radius .",
    "for @xmath261 these percentages increase very slowly with increasing @xmath262 we never reach @xmath263 because of the substantial penetration of the wavefunction in the barrier material along the @xmath66-direction ( the thickness of the dot is only @xmath257 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath255 only @xmath264 of the electron wavefunction is inside the dot but @xmath265 of the hole wavefunction .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field on the dot size dependence of the exciton energy is also shown in fig .  7 for the case of @xmath174 notice that the largest @xmath179-dependence is found for very small and very large @xmath262 in both situations the confinement of the electron and hole are smallest and consequently the ratio between the magnetic energy and the confinement energy is largest . for intermediate dot size ,",
    "i.e. @xmath266 we observe the smallest effect of a magnetic field on the exciton energy .",
    "this is the region of dot size where the confinement potential is able to strongly confine the electron and hole to a small region in space .",
    "we also investigated the effect of varying @xmath17 on the electron - hole separation , both in the @xmath164 and in the @xmath66-direction .",
    "9 shows the result for @xmath254 and we see a rather high starting value at @xmath267 decreasing strongly for increasing @xmath262 this high value at small @xmath17 follows from the fact that a large part of the wavefunctions is outside the dot , so the particles are not really confined anymore , which means that they are farther away from each other .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "9 shows the electron - hole separation in the @xmath164-direction . also here",
    ", we start with a high value at very small @xmath268 followed by a strong decrease and a minimum of @xmath269 at @xmath270 further increasing @xmath268 we find again an enhancement of @xmath271 which initially is linear in @xmath268 but for @xmath272 starts to level off and reaches a constant value in the limit @xmath273    the low magnetic field diamagnetic coefficient @xmath274 can be obtained from the results of figs .  8 and 9 , where @xmath275 is the effective exciton mass .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "10 and we see a similar behaviour as for the radial electron - hole separation ( inset of fig .  9 ) . when calculating @xmath276 we took into account the variation of the effective exciton mass @xmath275 with varying disk radius .",
    "the effective mass is defined as @xmath277 with @xmath278 where @xmath279 and @xmath280 are the effective electron masses in respectively the barrier and the well and @xmath281 is the probability to find the electron in the well . in fig .",
    "8 we showed that there is a considerable change of @xmath281 for varying @xmath268 and this will have an effect on @xmath282 and @xmath283 for the hole we have the same mass in and outside the well , and therefore @xmath284 is independent of @xmath262 in fig .  11 , the evolution of @xmath282 and @xmath275 is depicted as a function of @xmath285 we see that for very small disks , where most of the wavefunction is outside the dot , the value of @xmath282 converges to @xmath286 as expected . for larger disk radii",
    ", this value decreases and for @xmath287 it reaches the limit @xmath288 which is larger than @xmath289 due to the penetration of the electron along the @xmath66-direction in the barrier because of the small thickness of the disk .",
    "the higher radial excited states @xmath290 for angular momentum @xmath291 are calculated within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the result for a disk with radius @xmath148 and thickness @xmath257 is shown in fig .",
    "12(a ) , which clearly shows the appearance of anti - crossing of levels for higher @xmath61 states and the energy scale for such states is also substantially larger than for the angular momentum states . this anti - crossing is due to the fact that we consider a fixed angular momentum @xmath45 for all states , which is a conserved quantity .",
    "the states with fixed @xmath45 are non degenerate .",
    "again we considered cases of different disk radii and we observe an enhancement of the anti - crossing for smaller disks ( fig .",
    "12(b ) ) and a diminishing of the anti - crossing for larger disks ( figs .",
    "12(b ) and 12(c ) ) .    to study the anti - crossing more closely , we considered the disk with @xmath292 and @xmath257 ( parameters corresponding to the dashed / dotted curve in fig .",
    "3 were used ) . for the 2d problem ,",
    "the radial part of the exciton wave function for a fixed @xmath45 can be written as ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath293 where @xmath294 and @xmath295 correspond to the energy levels of the one particle problem of electron and hole , respectively and @xmath56 is the relative angular momentum .",
    "the sum @xmath296 indicates that only even values of the relative angular momentum @xmath56 are taken when @xmath45 is even , and odd values otherwise . by studying the values of the coefficients @xmath297 , we could distinguish which one - particle states contribute most to the total exciton state . in figure  13(a ) ,",
    "the symbols on the curves indicate which is the dominant term , contributing to eq .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "13(b ) gives the @xmath298 value corresponding to the different symbols .",
    "notice that @xmath294 remains 1 , while @xmath295 can have higher values , which implies that the hole excited states are mixed in into the exciton wave function .",
    "the single particle hole states have lower energy , due to its higher effective mass .",
    "notice that when we connect each symbol by a line , we obtain intersecting levels .",
    "such a spectrum would be obtained if @xmath299 would be conserved quantities . because of the electron - hole interaction the different @xmath299 single particle states are mixed which leads to the anti - crossing of the levels .  because @xmath45 is a conserved quantity , crossings between different @xmath61 states",
    "are prohibited and therefore , for a fixed @xmath300 the system is forced to go to a different @xmath301-state .    the symbols in fig .",
    "13(a ) indicate only the dominant term in eq .",
    "( 27 ) , while the total summation considers typically about 750 terms . in fig .",
    "13(b ) we show how large the contribution of the dominant term is relative to the total sum of all terms .",
    "this percentage is defined as @xmath302 in fig .",
    "13(b ) we only show the result for the case of @xmath303 in order not to overload the figure .",
    "we want to emphasize that , as a function of the magnetic field , the contribution of the dominant term , which can differ with increasing magnetic field , is shown and not the evolution of the contribution of a particular state .",
    "for @xmath304 the @xmath305-state appears to be very stable , as it stays between 85% and 95% .",
    "this means that there is very little mixing with other states .",
    "the @xmath306-state for @xmath307 is also very stable at low fields , but from @xmath308 the percentage drops , which indicates that another state is becoming important and serious mixing occurs .",
    "finally at @xmath309 the @xmath310-state becomes most important , which can also be seen in fig .",
    "now the percentage of the contribution of this @xmath310-state is plotted and we see an increase with @xmath179 . also for @xmath311 the transitions between the successive states are clearly visible from fig .",
    "each dip corresponds to a transition to another state with a consecutive anti - crossing of the energy levels .",
    "a dip indicates strong mixing between 2 or even 3 states where the dominant state gives only a slightly higher contribution than the other important state(s ) .",
    "we see strong dips at @xmath312 and @xmath313 which indicate the mixing between respectively @xmath314 @xmath315 @xmath316 and @xmath317 @xmath315 @xmath318 comparison with fig .",
    "13(a ) shows that these magnetic field values mark also the anti - crossings between respectively @xmath319 and @xmath320 the height of the peaks is an indication of the stability of the state . at @xmath321",
    "e.g. , we see a very strong peak , whereas at @xmath322 only a small peak appears . comparing with fig .",
    "13(a ) learns that , at the region between 20 and 30@xmath323 there is a strong anti - crossing and , although , the system passes through the @xmath314 state , this state never becomes really important .    in the above discussion , we indicated the states with @xmath324 where @xmath56 is an integer number . however , the relative angular momentum @xmath56 is not a good quantum number , and therefore the expectation value of the operator @xmath325 is expected not to be an integer . in fig",
    "14 the expectation value @xmath326 is depicted for the different @xmath61-states as a function of the magnetic field , where @xmath327 is calculated by @xmath328 notice that @xmath326 tends to approach an integer value @xmath56 when one of the terms in the sum of eq .",
    "( 27 ) dominates .",
    "the transition between states with different @xmath56 is continuous .",
    "the more stable a state is , the better it approaches an integer value @xmath56 .",
    "the result for @xmath329 e.g. starts from @xmath330 at @xmath234 then increases up to about 0.75@xmath331 and at @xmath332 drops down to @xmath333 until @xmath334 where it starts to increase again , more slowly now , up to @xmath335 for @xmath336 until finally at @xmath337 it drops to less than @xmath338 this agrees very well with the predicted integer values for @xmath56 in fig .",
    "for other @xmath61-states , the agreement might be less good , which is due to the higher mixing with other states .    finally , we considered the energy states for different values of the total angular momentum @xmath45 within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the result for a disk with radius @xmath148 and thickness @xmath257 is shown in fig .",
    "15(a ) for the lowest radial state @xmath339 .",
    "notice that for @xmath234 the states with @xmath340 and @xmath341 are degenerate , which is lifted by a magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding splitting is the well - known zeeman splitting .",
    "for a smaller disk radius , @xmath342 all energies are shifted to higher values , the splitting between the energy levels is larger , and the zeeman splitting is increased ( fig .",
    "when increasing the disk radius @xmath268 i.e. @xmath343 and @xmath344 the difference between the different angular momentum levels decreases and the energy shifts to lower values ( figs .  15(c ,",
    "d ) ) . as in previous case of different @xmath61-states ,",
    "also here we studied which single particle @xmath345-states are most important in the sum of eq .",
    "( 27 ) and the percentage of their contribution . fig .",
    "16(a ) denotes , for a disk with radius @xmath148 and thickness @xmath149 the energies of the different @xmath45-states and the symbols indicate which @xmath346-state is most important at a particular value of the magnetic field .",
    "note that here both @xmath294 and @xmath295 remain 1 . in fig .",
    "16(b ) the percentage contribution of the particular @xmath299 state is depicted .",
    "we see a transition occurring for the @xmath347 and @xmath348 states .",
    "this follows also from fig .",
    "17 , where the expectation value @xmath326 of the relative angular momentum operator is plotted . for the @xmath349 states , @xmath326 remains quite constant , whereas for the other @xmath45-states , @xmath326 decreases towards a lower value of @xmath350 because the total angular momentum is a conserved quantity , energy levels corresponding to different @xmath45-values are allowed to cross , they do not mix .",
    "we calculated the groundstate energy ( and the excited states ) , the binding energy and the diamagnetic shift of an exciton in a quantum disk with radius @xmath17 and thickness @xmath18 for a hard wall confinement potential of finite height .",
    "the mass mismatch between the dot material and the surrounding material was taken into account .",
    "our calculation is based on the finite difference technique , where we used three different theoretical approaches , which include the electron - hole correlation on different levels .",
    "the 3d treatment is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and provides an ` exact numerical ' treatment of the exciton problem . for @xmath351",
    "the adiabatic approach is applicable and here we distinguish the cases with and without correlation .",
    "the latter only uses the single particle wave functions in order to calculate the exciton binding energy , whereas the first uses the total exciton wavefunction .    under the influence of an external applied magnetic field up to 40@xmath323 we find an increase of the exciton groundstate energy and binding energy .",
    "the electron - hole separation shows a squeezing of the exciton due to the magnetic field .",
    "this can also be seen from the electron and hole densities in and around the dot .",
    "our theoretical results of the diamagnetic shift are in very good agreement with the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite if we assume that the light hole is involved in the exciton .    when considering a varying disk radius @xmath268 we found a strongly decreasing exciton binding energy with decreasing @xmath17 for very small @xmath17-values , which indicates that the dots are too small to confine the exciton .",
    "this explanation is corroborated by an investigation of the radial electron - hole separation and of the percentage of the wavefunction in the dot , which indeed shows that , for very small @xmath268 a large part of the wavefunction is situated outside the dot . in the large @xmath17-regime the exciton binding energy decreases with increasing @xmath17 and approaches a constant value for @xmath352 in the presence of an applied magnetic field , the exciton binding energy approaches a constant value for large disks much earlier than for the @xmath172 case , indicating that the dot confinement is dominated by the magnetic confinement .",
    "results for higher excited radial states , @xmath353 show an anti - crossing of levels which is more pronounced for small dot radius .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath45 is a conserved quantity .",
    "the relative angular momentum @xmath354 however , is not a good quantum number . because of the coupling between the electron and the hole , the exciton wave function is a linear combination of all possible one - particle wave functions .",
    "we investigated which @xmath355-states contribute most and how large its contribution is to the total exciton wavefunction .",
    "furthermore we investigated the expectation value of the relative angular momentum operator @xmath356 which is not quantized and varies with the magnetic field .",
    "the degeneracy of the different total angular momentum states is lifted due to the presence of the confinement potential and the zeeman splitting",
    ". this splitting decreases with increasing dot radius @xmath262 also here we investigated the contribution of the one particle states to the total exciton wavefunction .",
    "the energy states with different total angular momentum @xmath45 can cross with varying magnetic field , because @xmath45 is a good quantum number .",
