    "given an oriented surface @xmath0 and two oriented closed curves @xmath1 and @xmath2 intersecting transversely in double points , goldman @xcite defined a bracket operation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath3=\\sum_{p\\in{\\alpha}\\cap{\\beta}}\\epsilon(p)({\\alpha}*_p{\\beta})\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the sign of the intersection between @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the loop product of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath5 .    in the paper @xcite , goldman showed that the bracket operation is well defined on @xmath7 , the set of all free homotopy classes of oriented closed curves in @xmath0 .",
    "hence it can be extended linearly to @xmath8 , the free module generated by @xmath7 .",
    "he also proved that the bracket is skew - symmetric and satisfies jacobi identity .",
    "therefore the bracket operation is a lie bracket and it gives a lie algebra structure on @xmath8 which we denote by @xmath9 .",

    "goldman discovered this bracket operation while studying the weil - petersson symplectic form on teichmller space . using wolpert s @xcite result on length and twist flow he showed that if goldman bracket between two closed curve is zero and one of them has a simple representative then their geometric intersection number is zero .",

    "using combinatorial topology , chas @xcite proved a stronger version of goldman s result namely if one of the curves has a simple representative then the number of terms in the goldman bracket is same as their geometric intersection number .",

    "taking sufficiently higher power @xmath14 of @xmath1 we ensure that if the geodesics are same then the quasi - geodesics are also same and hence the terms have same sign .",
    "therefore there is no cancellation between the terms of @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "now if an element @xmath17 of @xmath9 belongs to the center then we consider a simple closed curve @xmath1 which intersects atleast one of the curves @xmath18 non - trivially .",
    "taking sufficiently higher power of @xmath1 we ensure that the same terms of @xmath19 $ ] has the same sign .",
    "also we show that if one term of @xmath19 $ ] and another term of @xmath20 $ ] are same then @xmath18 and @xmath21 are conjugates .",
    "therefore if @xmath22 $ ] is zero for all closed curve @xmath23 then each @xmath18 is disjoint from every simple closed curve and hence each @xmath18 is either homotopic to a point or a boundary component or a puncture . a crucial fact we use in our proof is that the lifts of a simple closed geodesic in @xmath15 are disjoint .",
    "* organization of the paper : * in section 2 we recall some basic facts about hyperbolic geometry and hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "we also define the intersection number and loop product between two curves intersecting transversally ( not necessarily in double points ) and give an algebraic description of the geometric intersection number . in section 3",
