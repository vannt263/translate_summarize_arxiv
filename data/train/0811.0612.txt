    "unbound hvss were predicted by @xcite as the natural consequence of the massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic center . following the discovery of the first hvs @xcite , observers have reported the discovery of at least 16 unbound hvss and evidence for a similar number of bound hvss ejected by the same mechanism @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations of 4 hvss establish they are main sequence b stars @xcite like the s - stars orbiting sgr a@xmath1 today @xcite . although not all unbound stars are necessarily hvss  the massive b star hd 271791 is the first example of an unbound `` hyper - runaway '' ejected from the outer disk @xcite  runaway ejection velocities are limited to @xmath2300  km  s@xmath3 for 3 m@xmath4 stars @xcite .",
    "thus the 14 unbound 2.5 - 4 m@xmath4 stars found in the @xcite targeted surveys are almost certainly hvss ejected from the galactic center .",
    "remarkably , 8 of the 14 hvss in the @xcite targeted surveys are located in just two constellations , leo and sextans , even though the surveys cover @xmath5 of the sky .",
    "this spatial anisotropy is almost certainly linked to the origin of the hvss .    in  2",
    "we show that the observed distribution of hvss on the sky is anisotropic at the 3-@xmath0 level . in  3 we discuss plausible explanations for the observed anisotropy of hvss .",
    "we consider the 14 hvss from the combined surveys of @xcite .",
    "our surveys use the mmt telescope to measure radial velocities for stars with the colors of 2.5 - 4 m@xmath4 stars .",
    "heliocentric velocities are converted to galactocentric velocities assuming that the local rotation speed is 220 km s@xmath3 and that the sun moves at ( u , v , w)=(10 , 5.2 , 7.2 ) km s@xmath3 relative to the local standard of rest @xcite .",
    "the original hvs survey @xcite is 100% complete for stars with @xmath6 over 7300  deg@xmath7 covered by the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 .",
    "the new hvs survey @xcite is 59% complete for stars with @xmath8 over the same region of sky .",
    "figure [ fig : polar ] plots the spatial distribution of stars with observed velocities .",
    "the combined hvs survey contains 693 stars and 14 hvss in the 7300 deg@xmath7 sloan region covering the north galactic cap .",
    "hvs2 @xcite is also located in this region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : polar ] ) , however it falls outside our color / magnitude criteria .",
    "thus we exclude hvs2 from this analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : gll ] plots the cumulative galactic longitude and latitude distributions of the hvss and the other survey stars .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests find 0.007 and 0.11 likelihoods that the hvss are drawn from the same longitude and latitude distributions , respectively , as the survey stars .",
    "thus the distribution of hvs longitudes appears anisotropic at the 3-@xmath0 level .    as a second test",
    ", we explore the anisotropy in terms of the distribution of angular separations , @xmath9 , of the hvss compared to the survey stars . because the new hvs survey is not yet complete ,",
    "we calculate @xmath9 s for all unique pairs of stars in the new and original surveys separately .",
    "the original survey includes hvs4-hvs10 ; a k - s test finds a 0.031 likelihood that those hvss are drawn from the same distribution of @xmath9 as the original survey stars .",
    "the new survey includes hvs1 and hvs11-hvs16 ; a k - s test finds a @xmath10 likelihood that those hvss are drawn from the same distribution of @xmath9 as the new survey stars .",
    "figure [ fig : angcor ] plots the @xmath9 s of both surveys concatenated together .",
    "the likelihood of the combined set of hvss is @xmath11 ; thus the distribution of hvs angular separations differs from the distribution of survey star angular separations at the 5-@xmath0 level .    as a third test",
    ", we measure the clustering of hvss using the two - point angular correlation function @xmath12 .",
    "we use a monte carlo estimator @xcite and compare the observed hvss against 10@xmath13 sets randomly drawn from the survey region .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : angcor ] plots the resulting @xmath12 in 15@xmath14 bins .",
    "errorbars are determined by poisson statistics .",
    "hvss are clustered at small angular separations @xmath15 and missing at large angular separations @xmath16 with @xmath23.5-@xmath0 significance .",
    "we now consider the spatial anisotropy of lower velocity stars that may also be hvss .",
    "@xcite identify 4 `` possible hvss , '' stars that are bound in the @xcite potential model but unbound in the @xcite potential model . adding the 4 possible hvss to the above analysis",
    "reduces the significance of the anisotropy to the 2-@xmath0 level .",
    "there are also 8 possibly `` bound hvss , '' stars with @xmath17 km s@xmath3 that are significant outliers from the overall velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "adding the bound hvss to the above analysis yields an insignificant anisotropy .",
    "thus lower velocity stars have a more isotropic distribution , a trend noted previously in @xcite .",
    "there are 3 pairs of unbound hvss with angular separations less than 3.5@xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] ) : hvs7 & hvs15 near ( @xmath18)=(265@xmath14 , 55@xmath14 ) , hvs12 & hvs13 and hvs12 & hvs14 near ( @xmath18)= ( 245@xmath14 , 52@xmath14 ) .",
    "any physical association between the individual hvss , however , appears unlikely .",
    "hvs7 & hvs15 are separated by @xmath19 but have velocities and distances that imply a @xmath270 myr difference in travel time from the galactic center ( see fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "hvs12 has a 429 km s@xmath3 minimum rest - frame velocity very similar to that of hvs13 and hvs14 , but it has half the distance of the other two hvss .",
    "thus none of the hvs pairs share a common ejection event .",
    "we observe that the spatial anisotropy of unbound hvss is statistically robust , that lower velocity hvss are systematically more isotropic , and that apparent close pairs of hvss are physically unrelated .",
    "possible explanations for the observations include :    _ selection effect .",
    "_ previously , we argued that the hvs anisotropy may be a selection effect of our magnitude - limited survey and the sun s off - center location in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , this selection effect can account only for an extra @xmath210% hvss in the anti - center hemisphere , not all of the hvss in the anti - center hemisphere . moreover , the observed hvss cluster around @xmath20 , not @xmath21 .",
    "_ runaways .",
    "_ runaway stars like hd 271791 may contaminate the population of hvss .",
    "however , we expect runaways ejected from the disk to have an isotropic distribution in galactic longitude , as demonstrated by the @xcite hipparcos - selected sample of runaway b stars . moreover , because runaways are systematically ejected at low velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fastest runaways are those ejected in the direction of galactic rotation and thus preferentially found at low galactic latitudes . thus the expected distribution of runaway longitudes and latitudes are contrary to the observed distribution of hvss",
    ".    _ large scale structure . _",
    "the distribution of local group dwarf galaxies is anisotropic , possibly due to a tidal origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a tidal debris origin appears supported by the clumping of hvs travel times around 100 - 200 myr , however the travel times are simply a product of the hvs s @xmath2500 km s@xmath3 velocities and our magnitude - limited survey depth of 50 - 100 kpc .",
    "hvs travel times are in fact problematic for a tidal debris origin because the times are a significant fraction of the stars main sequence lifetimes , and multiple ( gas - rich ) tidal disruption events would be required to explain the full @xmath22 yr span of hvs travel times .",
    "no dwarf galaxy in the local group travels with radial velocities comparable to the unbound hvss ; known dwarf galaxy remnants like the sgr stream @xcite are bound .",
    "we thus consider tidal debris an unlikely explanation for the observed set of hvss ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "_ binary black hole .",
    "_ while an equal - mass binary mbh is ruled out in the galactic center @xcite , theorists speculate that the massive star clusters in the galactic center form intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) in their cores .",
    "if such imbhs exist , dynamical friction causes them to in - spiral into the central mbh , preferentially ejecting hvss from their orbital planes .",
    "thus the expected signature of a imbh in - spiral is a ring of hvss around the sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue , however , that stellar interactions perturb the orbital plane of an in - spiraling imbh ; the resulting hvs distribution in this scenario may in fact be isotropic .",
    "moreover , a single imbh in - spiral event happens on timescales 10 - 100@xmath23 shorter than the observed span of hvs travel times ; multiple imbh in - spiral events are required to explain the observed hvss .",
    "_ galactic center structure . _",
    "the galactic center contains many well - defined structures . as illustrated in @xcite , the molecular gas circum - nuclear disk and the ionized northern arm",
    "are roughly aligned with the plane of the milky way .",
    "the gaseous minispiral is perpendicular to the plane of the milky way .",
    "notably , the stellar disk 0.1 pc from the mbh is roughly perpendicular to the gaseous components @xcite .",
    "the stellar disk contains massive stars @xcite , possibly formed in - situ from a gas accretion disk @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions between a pair of stellar disks may scatter stars in towards the mbh , explaining both the s - stars and the hvss @xcite .",
    "clearly , the galactic center contains non - isotropic distributions of stars and gas which may provide a natural source for the observed anisotropy of hvss ejected from the galactic center .",
    "however , it is unclear if the observed structures can persist long enough to explain the anisotropic distribution of hvss .",
    "unbound hvss are spatially anisotropic at the 3-@xmath0 level .",
    "the anisotropy is most significant in galactic longitude , and not in latitude .",
    "lower velocity hvss are systematically more isotropic , and apparent close pairs of hvss are physically unrelated .",
    "the observed distribution of hvss is linked to the origin of the hvss . @xcite",
    "propose a tidal debris explanation , although this appears difficult to reconcile with all the observations .",
    "we investigate other physical models for the anisotropy in a separate paper . in the future ,",
    "measuring the distribution of bound and unbound hvss over the southern sky will allow us to better constrain the anisotropy and the origin of hvss .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained at the mmt observatory , a joint facility of the smithsonian institution and the university of arizona .",
    "this research makes use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services .",
