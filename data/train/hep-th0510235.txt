    "a supersymmetric brane in type ii string theory is a @xmath0 bps object .",
    "the bound state of @xmath1 identical branes ( wrapped on a torus ) can be mapped by duality to a massless quantum with momentum @xmath2 on a circle of radius @xmath3 .",
    "thus the bound state has degeneracy 256 , regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "the situation is very different for @xmath4 bps states .",
    "such states can be made in many duality related ways : ns1-p , ns1-d0 , d0-d4 , d1-d5 etc .",
    "if the two charges are @xmath5 then the degeneracy of the bound state is @xmath6 $ ] @xcite . in the classical limit @xmath7",
    "this degeneracy manifests itself as a continuous family of solutions .",
    "examples are the 2-charge d1-d5 solutions found in @xcite and the supertubes constructed in @xcite .",
    "these 2-charge states are important because they give the simplest example of a black hole type entropy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the question : what is the low energy dynamics of such @xmath4 bps states ?",
    "we will perform some calculations to arrive at a conjecture for the answer . the behavior of the system can depend on whether the coupling is small or large , and whether we have bound states or unbound states .",
    "for this reason we first give an overview of _ possible _ dynamical behaviors , and then summarize our computations and conclusions .      in the following",
    "it will be assumed that all compactifications are toroidal , and all branes are wrapped on these compact directions in a way that preserves @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "\\(a ) _ ` drift ' on moduli",
    "space:_a d0 brane can be placed at rest near a d4 brane ; there is no force between the branes .",
    "thus we have a moduli space of possibilities for the relative separation .",
    "if we give the branes a small relative velocity @xmath8 then we get a @xmath9 force , and the resulting motion can be described by ` motion on moduli space ' @xcite .",
    "more generally , we can make 3-charge black holes that are @xmath10 bps and their slow motion will be described by motion on a moduli space @xcite . for later use",
    "we make the required limits explicit : the velocity @xmath8 is @xmath11 , the time over which we follow the motion is @xmath12 , and the distance in moduli space over which the configuration ` drifts ' is @xmath13 v~ ,  t~1 ,  x~1 ,  ( 0 ) [ drift ] note that the different branes or black holes involved here are not bound to each other .",
    "\\(b ) _ oscillations:_consider branes carrying just one charge , and let these be ns1 for concreteness .",
    "then the force between branes is @xmath14 .",
    "so for the relative motion between such branes we again get ` drift ' on moduli space except that the moduli space is flat @xcite .",
    "but we can also focus on just one brane and study its low energy excitations .",
    "these will be vibration modes along the brane , with the amplitude for each harmonic behaving like a harmonic oscillator .",
    "calling the amplitude for a given harmonic @xmath15 we note that @xmath16 will have the time evolution @xmath17 . setting @xmath18 for a small deformation ,",
    "the analogue of ( [ drift ] ) is v~ ,  t~1 ,  x~ ,  ( 0 ) [ osc ] where we have assumed that we are not looking at a zero mode @xmath19 .",
    "for the zero mode we will have the behavior x = x_0+vt [ zero ] and we get ` drift ' over configuration space with characteristics given by ( [ drift ] ) .",
    "\\(c ) _ ` quasi - oscillations ' : _ consider a charged particle free to move in the @xmath20 plane in a uniform magnetic field @xmath21 .",
    "the particle can be placed at rest at any position on the plane , and it has the same energy at all these points .",
    "thus far its behavior looks like that of a system with a zero mode .",
    "but if we give the particle a small velocity then it describes a small circle near its original position , instead of ` drifting ' along the plane .",
    "the motion is described by v~ ,  t~1 ,  x~  ( 0 ) [ quasi ] thus even though we may have a continuous family of energetically degenerate configurations , this does not mean that the dynamics will be a ` drift ' along this space .",
    "\\(d ) _ gravitational radiation : _ we are going to give our system a small energy above extremality . but",
    "the system is coupled to type ii supergravity , and there are massless quanta in this theory .",
    "thus any energy we place on our branes can leave the branes and become radiation flowing off to infinity .",
    "there will of course always be some radiation from any motion in the system , but the relevant issue here is the time scale over which energy is lost to radiation . if the time scale relevant to the dynamics is @xmath22 then as @xmath23 we have to ask what fraction of the energy is lost to radiation in time @xmath22 . if the fraction is @xmath13 , then the system is strongly coupled to the radiation field and can not be studied by itself while ignoring the radiation .",
    "if on the other hand the fraction of energy lost to radiation goes to zero as @xmath23 then the radiation field decouples and radiation can be ignored in the dynamics .",
    "\\(e ) _ excitations trapped near the brane : _ in the d1-d5 system we can take a limit of parameters such that the geometry has a deep ` throat ' region . in @xcite",
    "it was found that excitations of the supergravity field can be trapped for long times in this throat ; equivalently , we can make standing waves that leak energy only slowly to the radiation modes outside the throat @xcite .",
    "these are oscillation modes of the supergravity fields and thus could have been listed under ( b ) above .",
    "we list them separately to emphasize that the fields excited need not be the ones making the original brane state ; thus the excitation is not in general a collective mode of the initial fields .",
    "consider first the d1-d5 bound state geometries found in @xcite .",
    "these geometries are flat space at infinity , they have a locally @xmath24 ` throat ' , and this throat ends smoothly in a ` cap ' . the geometry of the cap changes from configuration to configuration , and is parametrized by a function @xmath25 .",
    "all the geometries have the same mass and charges , are @xmath4 bps , and yield ( upon quantization ) different bound states of the d1-d5 system .    what happens if we take one of these geometries and add a small energy ?",
    "the bound state of d1-d5 branes has a nontrivial transverse size , so one may say that the brane charges have separated away from each other in forming the bound state .",
    "if the charges indeed behave like separate charges then we would expect ` drift on moduli space ' dynamics , ( type ( a ) in our list ) . or does the bound state fragment into a few unbound states , which then drift away from each other ? this is in principle possible , since the d1-d5 system is threshold bound .",
    "do we stay within the class of bound geometries of @xcite but have ` drift on moduli space ' ( [ drift ] ) between different bound state configurations ( i.e. drift on the space @xmath25 ) ? or do we have one of the other possibilities ( b)-(e ) ?",
    "now consider the opposite limit of coupling : take a supertube in flat space .",
    "the supertube carries ns1-d0 charges , and develops a d2 ` dipole ' charge .",
    "this d2 brane can take on a family of possible profiles in space , giving a continuous family of @xmath4 bps configurations .",
    "what happens if we take a supertube in any given configuration and add a small amount of energy ?",
    "is there a ` drift ' among the family of allowed configurations , or some other kind of behavior ?    in @xcite",
    "the ` round supertube ' was considered , and the low energy behavior yielded excitations with time dependence @xmath26 .",
    "can we conclude that there is no ` drift ' among supertube configurations ?",
    "any drift can occur only between states that have the same values of conserved quantities .",
    "the round supertube has the maximal possible angular momentum @xmath27 for its charges , and is the only configuration with this @xmath27 .",
    "so ` drifting ' is not an allowed behavior if we give a small excitation to this particular supertube , and we must look at the generic supertube to know if periodic behavior is the norm .",
    "we now list our computations and results :    \\(i ) first we consider the 2-charge systems in flat space ( i.e. , we set @xmath28 ) .",
    "it turns out that the simplest system to analyze is ns1-p , which is given by a ns1 string wrapped @xmath29 times around a circle @xmath30 , carrying @xmath31 units of momentum along the @xmath30 .",
    "the added excitation creates further vibrations on the ns1 .",
    "but this is just a state of the free string , and can be exactly solved ( the classical solution is all we need for our purpose ) . taking the limit @xmath32 we extract the dynamical behavior of the supertube formed by ns1-p charges . in this way",
    "we get not only the small perturbations but arbitrary excitations of the supertube .",
    "we then dualize from ns1-p to d0-ns1 which gives us the traditional supertube .",
    "this supertube can be described by a dbi action of a d2 brane carrying fluxes .",
    "we verify that the solution found through the ns1-p system solves the dynamical equations for the d2 , both at the linear perturbation level and at the nonlinear level .    even before doing the calculation it is easy to see that there is no ` drift ' over configurations in the ns1-p dynamics .",
    "the bps string carries a right moving wave , and the excitation just adds a left moving perturbation .",
    "since right and left movers can be separated , the perturbation travels around the string and the string returns to its initial configuration after a time @xmath33 . but this behavior of the ` supertube ' is not an oscillation of type ( b ) ; rather it turns out to be a ` quasi - oscillation ' of type ( c ) . this can be seen from the fact that even though we move the initial tube configuration towards another configuration of the same energy , the resulting motion is periodic rather than a ` drift ' which would result from a zero mode ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) our goal is to move towards larger values of the coupling @xmath34 . at @xmath28 the gravitational effect of the supertube",
    "does not manifest itself at any distance from the supertube .",
    "now imagine increasing @xmath34 , till the gravitational field is significant over distances @xmath35 from the supertube .",
    "let the radius of the curve describing the supertube profile be @xmath36 .",
    "we focus on the domain q a then we can look at a small segment of the supertube which looks like a straight line . but",
    "this segment is described by a geometry , and we look for small perturbations of the geometry .",
    "we solve the linearized supergravity equations around this ` straight line supertube ' and note that the resulting periods of the solutions agree with ( i ) above .",
    "we note however that far from the supertube the gravity solution will be a perturbation on free space with some frequency satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "the only such solutions are traveling waves . for small @xmath38",
    "we find that the amplitude of the solution when it reaches the approximately flat part of spacetime is small .",
    "thus we expect that the radiation into modes of type ( d ) will be suppressed by a power of @xmath39 .",
    "\\(iii ) now imagine increasing @xmath34 to the point where q~a in this situation we see no reason why the part of the wavefunction leaking into the radiation zone should be suppressed .",
    "thus we expect that the excitation will not be confined to the vicinity of the branes , but will be a gravitational wave that will flow off to infinity over a time of order the crossing time across the diameter of the supertube .",
    "\\(iv ) we increase the coupling further so that q a now the geometry has a deep ` throat ' and as mentioned above we find excitations which stay trapped in this throat for long times , with only a slow leakage to radiation at infinity .",
    "what is the relation between these excitations and those found in ( ii ) ?",
    "we argue that these two kinds of excitations are different , and represent the excitations in two different phases of the 2-charge system .",
    "these two phases were identified by looking at microscopic degrees of freedom as a function of @xmath34 in @xcite , and what we see here appears to be a gravity manifestation of the transition .",
    "\\(v ) all the above computations were for _ bound states _ of the 2-charge system .",
    "but we have seen above that if have _ unbound _ states  two different 2-charge black holes for example  then we get ` drift ' modes of type ( a ) .",
    "it looks reasonable to assume that in any coupling domain if we have two or more different bound states then the relative motion of these components will be a ` drift ' .",
    "for example at @xmath28 we can have two supertubes that will move at constant velocity past each other .",
    "it is intriguing to conjecture that this represents a basic difference between bound and unbound states : bound states have no ` drift ' modes and unbound states do have one or more such modes .",
    "the importance of this conjecture is that 3-charge systems are very similar to 2-charge ones , so we would extend the conjecture to the 3-charge case as well . while all bound states can be explicitly constructed for the 2-charge case , we only know a few 3-charge bound states @xcite . there is a way to construct _ all _ 3-charge supersymmetric solutions @xcite but the construction does not tell us which of these solutions are bound states . since these bound states are the microstates of the 3-charge extremal black hole , it is very important to be able to select the bound states out of all the possible supersymmetric solutions .",
    "the above conjecture says that those states are bound which do not have any ` drift ' type modes of excitations , and the others are unbound .",
    "if this conjecture is true , then we have in principle a way to identify all 3-charge black hole states .    note",
    ": we will use the term ` supertube ' or just ` tube ' for 2-charge bound states in all duality frames , and at all values of the coupling .",
    "the supertube made from d0,ns1 charges carries a d2 dipole charge , and we will call this the d0-ns1 supertube or the d2 supertube . when we use charges ns1,p we will call the object the ns1-p supertube .",
    "we will find that the most useful representation of the 2-charge system will be ns1-p .",
    "we compactify a circle @xmath30 with radius @xmath40 ; let @xmath41 be the coordinate along this @xmath30 . the elementary string ( ns1 )",
    "is wrapped on this @xmath30 with winding number @xmath29 , and @xmath31 units of momentum run along the @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the _ bound _ state of these charges .",
    "this corresponds to the ns1 being a single ` multiwound ' string with wrapping number @xmath29 , and the momentum is carried on this ns1 by its transverse oscillations .",
    "consider first the bps states of this system .",
    "then all the excitations carry momentum in one direction ; we set this to be the positive @xmath42 direction and call these excitations ` right moving ' . in fig.[fig1m](a ) we open up the multiwound string to its covering space where we can see the transverse oscillation profile . as explained in @xcite these oscillations cause the @xmath29 strands to separate from each other and the bound state acquires a transverse ` size ' . for the generic state of this 2-charge system",
    "the radius of the state is @xmath43 and the surface area of this region gives the entropy of the state by a bekenstein type relation @xcite ~s_micro=2 to understand the generic state better it is useful to look at configurations that have a much larger transverse size , and later take the limit where we approach the generic state .",
    "the relevant limit is explained in @xcite . in this limit",
    "the wavelength of the vibration on the multiwound string is much larger than the radius of the @xmath30 , so locally the strands of the ns1 look like fig.[fig1m](b ) . in the classical limit @xmath44",
    "these strands will form a continuous ` strip ' , which will be described by ( i ) the profile of the strip in the space transverse to the @xmath30 and ( ii ) the ` slope ' of the strands at any point along the profile .",
    "is fixed at @xmath40 . ]",
    "-1.0truecm    - 1truein .",
    "( b ) the strands of the ns1 as they appear in the actual space.,title=\"fig:\",width=432 ]    -1.7truein    an s - duality gives ns1-p @xmath45 d1-p , and a further t - duality along @xmath42 gives d1-p @xmath45 d0-ns1 .",
    "but note that locally the string is slanted , and the t - duality also generates a local @xmath46 charge .",
    "thus we get a ` supertube ' where the d0-ns1 have formed a d2 @xcite .",
    "there is of course no _ net _ d2 charge ; rather the d2 is a ` dipole ' charge .",
    "note also that the slope of the ns1 in the starting ns1-p configuration implies that the momentum is partly along the direction of the ` strip ' .",
    "since we do no dualities in the strip direction we will end up with momentum being carried along the d2 supertube .    in this bps configuration",
    "the d2 supertube is stationary .",
    "if we add some extra energy to the tube ( while keeping its true ( i.e. non - dipole ) charges fixed ) then we will get the dynamics of the supertube .",
    "but we can study the dynamics in the ns1-p picture and dualize to the d2 supertube at the end if we wish . in the ns1-p picture",
    "we just have to study a free , classical string . here",
    "the left and right movers decouple and the problem can be solved exactly .",
    "let us review this solution and extract the dynamics of the ` supertube ' in the limit of large charges .",
    "the string dynamics in flat space is described by the nambu - goto action s_ng =- t [ ng ] where t=12 we can get an equivalent dynamics by introducing an auxiliary metric on the world sheet ( this gives the polyakov action ) s_p =- t2d^2 g^ab [ polyakov ] the variation of @xmath47 gives -12 g_abx^^cx_^dg^cd=0 so @xmath47 must be proportional to the induced metric . substituting this @xmath47 in ( [ polyakov ] ) we get back ( [ ng ] ) , thus showing that the two actions are classically equivalent .",
    "the @xmath48 equations give _ a [ g^ab]=0 note that the solution for the @xmath48 does not depend on the conformal factor of @xmath47 .",

    "imply that the coordinates @xmath48 can be expanded as x^=x^_+(^+)+x^_-(^- )    we can use the residual diffeomorphism symmetry to set the harmonic function @xmath53 to to be linear in @xmath54 . using a light cone",
    "coordinate allows the constraints ( [ condition ] ) to be solved without square roots , but for us this is not important since we will not need to quantize the string . ] x^0=a+b = a+b(^++^- ) [ btau ] let the coordinate along the @xmath30 be called @xmath42 .",
    "we can solve the constraints to express the terms involving @xmath42 in terms of the other variables .",
    "we find _ + y_+=,_- y_-= [ ysolex ] where @xmath55 are the spatial directions transverse to the @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 should be chosen in such a way that the coordinate @xmath42 winds @xmath57 times around a circle of length @xmath40 when @xmath58 .",
    "there is no winding around any other direction .",
    "we also use a reference frame in which the string has no momentum in any direction transverse to the @xmath30 .",
    "we let @xmath59 .",
    "then the target space coordinates can be expanded as y&=& n_pr_y + n_wr_y+_n=0(c_ne^i n^-+ d_n e^i n^ + ) x^i&=&_n=0(c^i_ne^i",
    "n^-+ d^i_n e^i n^ + ) [ xsolp ] define s_+=,s_-= from the energy and winding required of the configuration we find that the choice of signs in ( [ ysolex ] ) should be _ + y_+=s_+ ,  _ -y_-=-s_-    after an interval = [ ptau ] all the @xmath60 return to their original values . this can be seen by noting that @xmath61 is only a parameter that labels world sheet points , so the actual configuration of the system does not depend on the origin we choose for @xmath61 .",
    "thus consider the change ( = _ 1 ,  )   ( = _ 1 + ,  + ) [ shift ] from ( [ xsolp ] ) we see that the @xmath60 are periodic with period @xmath62 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath42 does not return to its original value , but in the classical limit that we have taken to get the ` supertube ' we have smeared over this direction and so the _ value _ of @xmath42 is not involved in describing the configuration of the supertube .",
    "but the _ slope _ of the ns1 at a point in the supertube _ is _ relevant , and is given by s=|x^i|/ ( y ) [ slope ] but = n_w r_y + _",
    "n0  [ ( -in)c_n e^in(-)+ ( in ) d_n e^in(+ ) ] we see that @xmath63 is periodic under ( [ shift ] ) and thus so is ( [ slope ] ) .    from ( [ btau ] )",
    "we see that when @xmath54 changes by the above period then x^0=b = band the supertube configuration returns to itself . but = ",
    "p^0 e where @xmath64 is the energy of the configuration .",
    "we therefore find that the motion of the supertube is periodic in the target space time coordinate with period t = x^0= e [ period ] for the ns1-p system the dipole charge is ns1  this arises from the fact that the ns1 slants as shown in fig.[fig1m](b ) and so there is a local ns1 charge along the direction of the supertube .",
    "the tension of the ns1 is @xmath65 .",
    "this is thus the mass of the dipole charge per unit length m_d=12 we then see that ( [ period ] ) can be recast as t=12 em_d [ periodp ] this form for the period will be of use to us later , because we will find that it holds in other duality frames as well .",
    "we can solve the ns1-p system exactly and we have thus obtained the exact dynamics of the supertube in flat space . for some purposes it will be useful to look at the small perturbations to the stationary tube configurations .",
    "we now study these small perturbations , starting in a slightly different way from the above analysis .",
    "consider first the string in a bps configuration : the wave on the string is purely right moving .",
    "we know that in this case the waveform travels with the speed of light in the positive @xmath42 direction .",
    "let us check that this is a solution of our string equations .",
    "this time we know the solution in the _ static _",
    "gauge on the worldsheet : t= b ,  y = b[static ] writing @xmath66 and noting that a right moving wave is a function of @xmath67 we expect the following to be a solution",
    "t = b^+ + ^-2,y = b^+ - ^-2,x^i = x^i(^- ) [ left ] in these worldsheet coordinates the induced metric is ds^2=-b^2d^+d^-+(x^ix^i)(d^-)^2 so it does not satisfy ( [ conformal ] ) .",
    "( here prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath68 )",
    ". however we can change to new coordinates on the worldsheet ( ^+,^-)=(^+ - f(^- ) , ^- ) [ change1 ] with f(^- ) = ( x^ix^i ) ( ^-)b^2 this brings the metric to the conformally flat form ds^2=-b^2d^-d^+ moreover , rewriting ( [ left ] ) in terms of @xmath69 t = b^+ + ^- + f(^-)2,y = b^+ - ^- + f(^-)2,=x^i(^- ) one sees that the configuration is of the form x^=x_+^(^+)+x_-^(^- ) [ sum ] so that the @xmath48 are harmonic in the coordinates @xmath69 . thus the coordinates @xmath69 are conformal coordinates for the problem and we have verified that ( [ left ] ) is a solution of the equations of motion .    we now proceed to adding a small right moving perturbation , which was our goal .",
    "consider the perturbed configuration & & t = b = b^+ + ^- + f(^-)2,y = b= b^+ - ^- + f(^-)2 + & & x^i = x^i(^-)+x^i(^+ ) [ solfp ] where @xmath70 is assumed small .",
    "then the induced metric on the worldsheet is ds^2 = -(b^2 - 2 x^ix^i)d^-d^+ + o ( x)^2(d^+)^2 so that it is conformally flat to first order in the perturbation .",
    "the target space coordinates @xmath48 in ( [ solfp ] ) are clearly of the form ( [ sum ] ) so they are harmonic , and we have found a solution of the string equations of motion .",
    "we can get a general solution of the ns1-p system by taking arbitrary harmonic functions @xmath60 in ( [ xsolp ] ) and determining @xmath53 , @xmath42 by ( [ btau ] ) , ( [ ysolex ] ) . taking the classical limit where the strands of the string forms a continuum gives the arbitrary motion of the supertube , and the period of this motion is given by ( [ periodp ] ) .",
    "the conformal gauge coordinate @xmath71 that is used on the string is not very intuitive , since it is determined by the state of the string .",
    "we next looked at the linearized perturbation to a bps state , and this time we started with an intuitively simple coordinate on the string  the static gauge coordinate @xmath72 proportional to the spacetime coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "we found the explicit map ( [ change1 ] ) to the conformal gauge coordinates .",
    "the solution to the linearized problem was then given by an arbitrary choice of the @xmath73 in ( [ solfp ] ) .",
    "we will now see that these solutions reproduce the behavior of the d2 brane supertube at the exact and linearized levels respectively .",
    "the ns1-p system is the easiest way to solve the problem , since it exhibits the separation of the dynamics into a left and a right mover ; this separation is not obvious in the other duality frames .",
    "in this section we will consider the more conventional definition of the supertube : the true charges are d0-ns1 and the dipole charge is a d2 .",
    "the dynamics is given by the dbi action of the d2 with worldvolume fields corresponding to the true charges .",
    "in @xcite perturbations were considered around the ` round supertube ' which has as its profile a circle in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "this supertube has the maximum possible angular momentum @xmath27 for its charges .",
    "so if we add a small perturbation to it we know that we will not get a ` drift ' through a set of supertube configurations ",
    "@xmath27 is conserved and there are no other configurations with this value of @xmath27 .",
    "so even though periodic excitations were found for this supertube we can not conclude from this that small perturbations to the generic supertube will also be periodic .",
    "thus we wish to extend the computation of @xcite to the generic supertube .",
    "we will write the equations of motion for the generic case , but instead of solving them directly we will note that we have already solved the problem in ns1-p language and we will just dualize the solution there and check that it solves the equations for the d0-ns1 supertube .",
    "we work in flat space with a compact @xmath30 of length @xmath75 , parametrized by the coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "we have already obtained the general motion of the supertube in the ns1-p description , and below will verify that this solves the general d2 supertube equations as well .",
    "but first we check the behavior of small perturbations , and for this purpose we model our presentation as close to that of @xcite as possible .",
    "thus we let the supertube lie along a closed curve @xmath76 in the @xmath74 plane , but @xmath76 need not be a circle as in @xcite .",
    "the worldvolume of the d2 will be @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath78 be the radial and angular coordinates in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "we will denote by @xmath79 all the coordinates other than @xmath80 .",
    "we will also sometimes use the notation @xmath81 .",
    "we fix a gauge in which the world volume coordinates on the d2 brane are @xmath82 .",
    "thus the angular coordinate in the supertube plane serves as the parameter along the supertube curve @xmath76 . on the d2 world volume",

    "it is to be noted that such series solutions in @xmath269 are asymptotic expansions rather than series with a nonzero radius of convergence @xcite , so these arguments are not a rigorous proof for the absence of infinitely long lived oscillations .",

    "there are several results that exclude such eigenvalues on general grounds @xcite .",
    "the required results come from two kinds of theorems .",
    "first we need to know that there is no ` potential well with infinitely high walls ' near the origin ; if there was such a well then we can have a positive energy eigenstate which has no ` tail ' outside the well .",
    "next , given that there _ is _ a tail outside the well we need to know that the potential falls off to zero fast enough and does not ` oscillate ' too much ; such oscillations of the potential can cause the wavefunction to be back - scattered towards the origin repeatedly and die off too fast to carry a nonzero flux at infinity .",
    "we can not directly apply these results to our problem because our equations are not exactly the schrodinger equation , but the potential like terms in our equations do not appear to be of the kind that will prevent flux leakage to infinity .    to summarize",
    ", we conjecture that as we increase @xmath34 to go from fig.[fig2 m ] ( a ) to fig.[fig2m](c ) the periodic oscillations present at @xmath164 merge into the continuum spectrum of bulk supergravity .",

    "we have no ` fractionation ' ; i.e. the effective string formed in the d1-d5 bound state has @xmath292 ` singly wound ' circles @xcite . thus the minimum energy needed to excite the system is the energy of one left and one right mover on the effective string e^d1d5_p|p=1r_y+1r_y=2r_y [ energy1 ] the charges d1-d5-p can be permuted into each other , so we can map d1-d5 to p - d1 , and then the dual of ( [ pr1 ] ) is p - d1  +  e  p - d1  +  d5 a further s duality brings the system to the ns1-p system that we are studying , and then we get p - ns1  +  e  p - ns1  +  ns5 [ pr2 ] this may look strange , since it says that if we excite an oscillating string the energy of excitations goes to creating pairs of ns5 branes ; we are more used to the fact that energy added to a string just creates more oscillations of the string .",
    "dualizing ( [ energy1 ] ) gives for the excitation ( [ pr2 ] ) the minimum energy threshold e^ns1p_ns5=2 m_ns5=2vr_yg^2^3 thus at small @xmath34 these excitations are indeed heavy and should not occur .",
    "for comparison , we find the minimum energy required to excite _ oscillations _ on the ns1-p system . for small @xmath34",
    "we use the spectrum of the free string which gives m^2= ( r_yn_1 + n_pr_y)^2 + 4 n_l= ( r_yn_1 - n_pr_y)^2 + 4 n_r [ massformula ] the lowest excitation is given by @xmath293 .",
    "this gives e^ns1p_oscillations = m=21m_t where @xmath290 is the total mass of the bps ns1-p state .",
    "we now observe that oscillations on the ns1-p system are lighter than ns5 excitations only when [ con2 ] thus for very small @xmath34 the lightest excitation on the ns1-p system is an oscillation of the string .",
    "but above a certain @xmath34 the @xmath294 pairs are lighter and so will be the preferred excitation when we add energy to the system .",
    "we now observe that the conditions ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) are the _",
    "same_. thus we see that when the ring is thin then in the corresponding microscopic picture we have ` 2-charge excitations ' ; i.e. the third charge ns5 is not excited and the string giving the ns1-p state just gets additional excitations which may be interpreted as pairs of ns1 and p charges .",
    "but when we increase the coupling beyond the point where the ring becomes ` thick ' and the geometry is better described as a throat , then the dual cft has ` 3-charge excitations ' which are pairs of ns5 branes .",
    "when @xmath34 is small and the ring is thin then the oscillations of the supertube are long lived because they couple only weakly to the radiation modes of the gravity field . when the tube becomes very _ thick _ then the oscillation modes are again long lived ",
    "we get @xmath288 and by ( [ slow ] ) this implies a very slow leakage of energy to infinity .    thus we see that the modes at small and large coupling should not be seen as the ` same ' modes ; rather the ` 2-charge modes ' at weak coupling disappear at larger @xmath34 because of coupling to the radiation field , and at still larger @xmath34 the ` 3-charge modes ' appear .",
    "for these latter modes one might say that the gravitational field of the system has ` trapped ' the excitations of the metric from the region @xmath295 , so that these modes have in some sense been extracted from the radiation field .",
    "consider a d0 brane placed near a d4 brane . the force between the branes vanishes . but now give the d0 a small velocity in the space transverse to the d4 .",
    "the force between the branes goes as @xmath9 , and the motion of the d0 can be described as a geodesic on the moduli space of its static configurations @xcite .",
    "this moduli space would be flat if we took a d0-d0 system ( which is 1/2 bps ) but for the d0-d4 case ( which is 1/4 bps ) the metric is a nonflat hyperkahler metric .",
    "we can look at more complicated systems , for example 3-charge black holes in 4 + 1 spacetime .",
    "now the system is 1/8 bps .",
    "the positions of the black holes give coordinates on moduli space , and the metric on moduli space was computed in @xcite .",
    "if we set to zero one of the three charges then we get a 1/4 bps system .",
    "it is easy to distinguish ` motion on moduli space ' from the kinds of oscillatory behavior that we have encountered in the dynamics of supertubes . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "when we have motion on moduli space we take the limit of the velocity going to zero , and over a long time @xmath22 the system configuration changes by order unity . using @xmath296 as a general symbol for",
    "the change in the configuration could be the separation of two black hole centers .",
    "] we have for ` drift on moduli space ' v~ ,  t~1 ,  x~1 ,  ( 0 ) [ driftq ] on the other hand for the periodic behavior that we have found for both the weak coupling and strong coupling dynamics of bound states , we have v~ ,  t~1 ,  x~  ( 0 ) [ quasiq ] note that for the motion ( [ driftq ] ) the energy lost to radiation during the motion vanishes as @xmath23 , so the dynamics ( [ driftq ] ) is unlike any of the cases that we have discussed for the bound state .",
    "while the moduli space metric in @xcite was found for spherically symmetric black holes ( ` naive geometries ' in the language of @xcite ) we expect that a similar ` drifting ' motion would occur even if we took two ` actual ' geometries of the 2-charge system and gave them a small relative velocity with respect to each other .",
    "thus such unbound systems would have a dynamical mode _ not _ present for the bound states .",
    "for the bound state 3-charge geometries that have been constructed @xcite the structure is very similar to the structure of 2-charge geometries .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to conjecture that 3-charge geometries will have a similar behavior : unbound systems will have ` drift ' modes like ( [ driftq ] ) while bound systems will have no such modes . if true , this conjecture could be very useful for the following reason .",
    "it is known how to write down the class of _ all _ 3-charge supersymmetric geometries @xcite .",
    "but we do not know which of these are bound states . on the other hand the microstates of the 3-charge black hole @xcite are bound states of three charges .",
    "if we can select the bound state geometries from the unbound ones by some criterion then we would have a path to understanding all the microstates of the 3-charge black hole .",
    "this is important because the 3-charge hole has a classical horizon and our results on this hole should extend to all holes .    to summarize",
    ", it seems a reasonable conjecture that out of the class of all supersymmetric 3-charge geometries the bound states are those that have no ` drift ' modes ( [ driftq ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to look for ` drift ' modes for the 3-charge geometries constructed recently in @xcite ; here the cft dual is not known so we do not know a priori if the configuration is a bound state .",
    "the same applies for geometries made by adding kk - monopole charge to bps systems carrying a smaller number of charges @xcite .",
    "it would also be useful to extend these considerations to the suggested construction of 3-charge supertubes and their geometries @xcite .    in the introduction",
    "we have also asked the question : can the bound state break up into two or more unbound states under a small perturbation ?",
    "since the bound state is only threshold bound , such a breakup is allowed on energetic grounds .",
    "but for the 2-charge system we see that bound states are not ` close ' to unbound states .",
    "the bound states are described by a simple closed curve traced out by the locations @xmath191 for @xmath297 .",
    "a superposition of _ two _ such bound states has _ two _ such simple closed curves .",
    "the curve can break up into two curves if it self - intersects , but in a generic state the curve is not self - intersecting .",
    "if we add a little energy to a 2-charge bound state then we have seen that the configuration does not ` drift ' through the space of bound states , so the curve will not drift to a curve with a self - intersection and then split .",
    "thus we expect that generic bound states are stable to small perturbations ; energy added to them causes small oscillations for a while and the energy is eventually lost to infinity as radiation .",
    "let us summarize our arguments and conjectures .",
    "if we have two bps objects with 1/4 susy then they feel no force at rest , but their low energy dynamics is a slow relative motion described by geodesics on a moduli space .",
    "if we look at just one 1/4 bps bound state then it has a large degeneracy , which in the classical limit manifests itself as a continuous family of time - independent solutions .",
    "if we add a small energy to the bps bound state , then what is the evolution of the system ?    based on the behavior of unbound objects",
    "one might think that there will again be a ` drift ' over the family of configurations , described by some metric on the moduli space of configurations .",
    "but we have argued that this is not what we should expect .",
    "we first looked at the 1/4 bps configurations at zero coupling , where we get ` supertubes ' described by a dbi action .",
    "we saw that the best way to get the dynamics of such 1/4 bps objects is to use the ns1-p picture , which is a ` multiwound string carrying a traveling wave ' .",
    "for this zero coupling limit we found that instead of a ` drift ' over configurations we get oscillatory behavior .",
    "these oscillations are not described by a collection of simple harmonic oscillators .",
    "rather they are like the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field where each term in the equation of motion has at least one time derivative , and there is a continuous family of equilibrium configurations .",
    "we found a simple expression ( [ periodp ] ) for the period of oscillations with arbitrary amplitude , which reduced to the period found in @xcite for the case of small oscillations of the round supertube .",
    "if we increase the coupling a little then we get a gravity description of the supertube , but with gravitational field of the tube extending only to distances small compared to the circumference of the tube .",
    "thus we get a ` thin ' long tube . zooming in to a point of the tube",
    "we see an essentially straight segment , and we studied the perturbations to this geometry .",
    "we found excitations that agree in frequency with those found from the zero coupling analysis .",
    "we noted that the part of the excitation that leaks out to spatial infinity will have the form of a traveling wave .",
    "as we increase the coupling the amplitude of the wave reaching this region becomes larger .",
    "thus there will be an energy flux leaking out to infinity , and the excitation will not remain concentrated near the supertube .",
    "but as we increase the coupling still further we find that the geometry develops a deep ` throat ' and we get a new kind of long lived excitation : supergravity modes can be trapped in this throat for long times , only slowly leaking their energy to infinity .",
    "we argued that the different kinds of excitations found at weak and strong coupling reflect the phase transition that had been noted earlier from the study of black holes @xcite . at weak coupling the excitations on such",
    "a system creates pairs of the charges already present in the bps state .",
    "but at larger coupling the excitation energy goes to creating pairs of a _ third _ kind of charge .",
    "the value of @xmath34 where this transition occurs was found to have the same dependence on @xmath298 as the value of @xmath34 where the supertube stops being ` thin ' ; i.e. where the gravitational effect of the tube starts extending to distances comparable to the radius of the tube .",
    "we have noted that bound states do not exhibit a ` drift ' over a moduli space of configurations , while unbound states do .",
    "if 3-charge systems behave qualitatively in the same way as 2-charge ones then this fact can be used to distinguish bound states from unbound ones for the class of 1/8 bps states ; such bound states would give microstates of the 3-charge extremal hole .",
