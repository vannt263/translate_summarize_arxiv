    "since the invention of laser , the quantum coherence has played a vital role in controlling the nonlinear optical properties of an atomic medium @xcite .",
    "the linear optical effect is attributed to the linear relationship between the input and output intensity . when the incident irradiance becomes large enough",
    ", nonlinear optical effect comes into play @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence helps in enhancing the efficiencies of nonlinear optical processes ( characterized by a complex third order susceptibility ) , thereby eliminating the linear absorption even at low light powers @xcite .",
    "while the real part of the third order susceptibility ( the kerr nonlinearity ) can produce significant cross - phase modulation @xcite , the imaginary part may lead to photon switching @xcite .",
    "further , quantum coherence can produce coherent population oscillations and sub - linewidth transmission resonances in two - level @xcite as well as in multilevel systems @xcite .",
    "this happens as an effect of temporal modulation of the population difference between the ground and excited state . besides transparency ,",
    "electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) may occur due to transfer of two - photon coherence between the degenerate excited levels to the degenerate ground levels @xcite .",
    "for the observation of the eia , the multi - level systems , especially the four - level n - type systems @xcite are the promising candidates , as they require a control field with low power .",
    "further , two - photon coherence in ladder - type energy - level configuration @xcite exhibits electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and two - photon absorption ( tpa ) for a weak probe laser , in presence of a strong coupling laser .",
    "this tpa phenomena in the ladder systems can be dramatically modified by quantum coherence and it can make an absorptive medium transparent to the probe field @xcite . such possibility has been originally proposed by agarwal and coworkers @xcite and demonstrated in @xcite . besides tpa , a large absorption at resonance can also arise due to three - photon coherence , termed as three photon electromagnetically induced absorption @xcite .",
    "all the above nonlinear phenomena assume a probe field , strength of which is such that it is enough to consider the coherence only up to a finite order of the probe field ( i.e. , only a finite order of susceptibility , say , up to third order ) .",
    "however , when the intensity of the probe field is increased , one needs to investigate the response of the medium for all orders of the probe field that gives rise to several interesting optical effects , namely optical bistability ( ob ) .",
    "this refers to possibility of two stable output fields for the same input field in an optical feedback network .",
    "the nonlinear interaction between a collection of atoms and the field mode along with the feedback inside an optical cavity leads to such a bistable behavior . based on the response of the optical feedback",
    ", the bistable device can be used as an optoelectronic component , viz .",
    ", an optical differential amplifier @xcite .",
    "the optical bistability has been extensively studied in two - level @xcite as well as in multi - level systems @xcite due to its application in ultrafast all - optical switches @xcite .",
    "harshawardhan and agarwal @xcite have proposed that by using quantum interference induced by control fields , one can decrease the threshold of bistability .",
    "this suggests that nonlinear effect becomes dominant even at a low input intensity .",
    "we further investigate the role of coherence into other nonlinear optical phenomena , namely saturable absorption ( sa ) and reverse saturable absorption ( rsa ) @xcite .",
    "the sa corresponds to the decrease of the ground state absorption of light as the input intensity increases . on the contrary ,",
    "the rsa is associated with the excited state absorption and as a consequence , the absorption inside the medium increases with the intensity of the input field .",
    "the rsa has been demonstrated in various compounds @xcite and has found application in _ optical limiting _ , viz . ,",
    "protection of electro - optical sensors or human eyes from intense laser pulses @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the effect of a control field on the nonlinear absorption characteristics of a probe field in four - level atomic systems .",
    "we consider all orders of the probe field in our analysis .",
    "the effect of atomic coherence as a function of all the fields is investigated .",
    "we show that while in the absence of the control field , the system exhibits transparency for the probe field , the nonlinear excitation is enhanced as the control field is introduced in the uppermost transition of a four - level ladder system .",
    "this enhancement of the nonlinear absorption leads to the absorptive optical switching @xcite in which the probe absorption can be switched on and off by a control field .",
    "we present numerical results to describe the optical switching in terms of a gaussian intensity profile of the probe field .",
    "we also describe the absorption characteristics for the atomic medium in a unidirectional ring cavity , leading to the optical bistability . in our model",
    ", the threshold of the ob can be controlled both by the control and the coupling field .",
    "further , via coupling the first excited state with a metastable state by a control field ( so as to form a y - type configuration ) , we show how the sa and rsa can be coherently manipulated , when both the coupling field and the probe field are of the same polarization and the same intensity .",
    "note that here we demonstrate the rsa effect in a simple _ atomic system _ thanks to the coherent _ control field_.    the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the four - level ladder model configuration along with its relevant equations . in sec .",

    "we find that as the input intensity increases upto a certain threshold , the system remains absorptive , in absence of the control field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the level @xmath7 decays much faster . at a certain input threshold , when the input intensity dominates over this decay rate , the system undergoes saturation and exhibits more transmission with larger input intensity , as in the case of sa .",
