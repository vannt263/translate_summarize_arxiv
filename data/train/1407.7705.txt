    "low - surface brightness supernova remnants ( snrs ) are important in shaping our current understanding of pulsar and supernova evolution , since the population of snrs in our galaxy is likely to be dominated by faint objects .",
    "in fact , around 85% of galactic snrs are expected to be of core - collapse origin @xcite .",
    "these are explosions of massive stars , most of which create stellar wind bubbles around them , and thus form low - surface brightness snrs .",
    "massive star explosions should also lead to the formation of a compact object that could be revealed in the radio and/or x - rays .",
    "high - resolution  and  observations have been particularly crucial in shedding light on the collapsed cores of the explosions and their relativistic outflows ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in particular",
    ", high - resolution and sensitive x - ray observations have contributed to the discovery of a diversity of neutron stars in snrs .",
    "this diversity includes rotation - powered pulsars such as the crab and vela pulsars , magnetically powered pulsars ( dubbed as ` magnetars ' and including the anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters ) , and other x - ray emitting neutron stars whose nature is still being debated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these include the central compact objects ( ccos ) in snrs and are typified by the casa compact object ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finding new compact objects in snrs will therefore help in shedding light on this diversity and on the connection between the compact objects and the progenitor stars forming their hosting snr .",
    "the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) @xcite is a high - resolution radio survey that incorporates single - antenna data to retain sensitivity to the largest structures ( such as faint filamentary non - thermal radio emission from snrs ) . in 2001 , the shell - type supernova remnant ( snr ) , 107 , was discovered in cgps data @xcite . including the one described in this paper , eight snr candidates have so far been discovered in the cgps @xcite . in 2008",
    ", we started a program to search for these snrs and their associated compact objects in  and  data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the snr g107.51.5 is located in a complex region of the galactic plane @xmath34 degrees west of cas  a @xcite . at 1420 mhz",
    ", the source appears as a thin filament on top of diffuse shell - like emission ( see contours in figure  [ xrayradioimage ] ) .",
    "combining the 408 mhz and the 1420 mhz emission , the spectral index was determined to be @xmath4 @xmath3 0.6 ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 )  typical of shell - type snrs .",
    "its identification as an snr is based mainly on its high polarized emission coincident with the filament and spectral index .",
    "its polarized intensity is 50% at 1420 mhz , and its peak fractional polarization of 71% is close to the theoretical maximum ( for @xmath4=0.6 ) .",
    "this was therefore identified as the most highly polarized snr known .",
    "the distance to this snr from various distance determination methods ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath8  kpc .",
    "the morphology of the snr and the structure of the ambient neutral hydrogen in the radio data suggests that this snr is @xmath336  kyr - old , and believed to be in a late stage of evolution , given that it is expanding in a high ambient density medium or originates from a supernova with low explosion energy @xcite . at the projected centre of the snr shell ,",
    "there is a unidentified source , 1rxs j225203.8 + 574249 , whose location is quite compelling : not only is it close to the projected centre of the snr , but if it is a neutron star and the explosion happened at its current position , then it would explain the peculiar appearance of the snr as a shell fragment . in all directions , the wind of the progenitor and the shock wave of the explosion would have been blocked by dense neutral hydrogen except for the gap in the direction of the radio shell .",
    "this , together with the snr s evolutionary state and location in a complex region of the galaxy , leads us to believe that the supernova explosion * was of core - collapse type * , and the  source , * located close to source 1 * in figure  [ xrayradioimageps ] , is possibly the collapsed core .",
    "is shown in yellow .",
    "coordinates are j2000 .",
    "[ xrayradioimage],height=288 ]        the small number of counts in the  data did not allow , however , for spectroscopy or detailed imaging of the overall region or point sources to be done , so an observation , described in  [ obs ] , has been carried out , primarily in order to make an x - ray detection of the snr , and to study the  source .    because the integration time was unfortunately significantly reduced by proton flaring ( see  [ obs ] ) , distinguishing diffuse x - ray emission from the snr on the images was not possible , but we estimate the strength of its x - ray emission through spectral analysis . in this work ,",
    "the main focus is to examine the discrete sources in the field .",
    "we were able to resolve a few dozen sources , * 18 of which have more than 25 counts according to the source detection * , and extract spectra for eight of them , including two very close to the location of the  source , which we preliminarily consider to be the likely neutron star associated with 107 .",
    "the snr 107 was observed with  in full window mode on 2007 january 23 for 34.8 ks ( obs i d : 0400600101 ) the pn @xcite and mos @xcite data were reduced with * * scientific analysis system ( sas ) * * version 13.5.1 . images and spectra were extracted using the *  extended source analysis software ( esas ) * package @xcite , which calls various sas routines to filter out proton flaring , identify and remove point sources ( for the diffuse analysis ) , and estimate backgrounds for the diffuse spectra by using the non - illuminated corners of the detectors . because of the high amount of proton flaring , the integration time was reduced to 11.7  ks for pn , 15.7  ks for mos1 , and 15  ks for mos2 .",
    "figures  [ xrayradioimage ] and [ xrayradioimageps ] show the   x - ray mosaic images in the 0.510 kev range , with cgps contours overlaid .",
    "these are combined , exposure - corrected images from pn , mos1 , and mos2 data from which particle and soft proton backgrounds have been subtracted .",
    "many discrete point - like sources and a few extended sources , most of which lie within the radio shell , can be seen on figure  [ xrayradioimageps ] .",
    "two methods were used to remove the contribution of the detected point sources ( see  [ detection ] for a description of the source detection ) to facilitate a close examination of the diffuse x - ray emission . for the first , the reconstructed image of the detected sources produced by the source detection program was subtracted from the original image .",
    "the second method is to exclude regions at the locations of the detected sources , which is done using the esas routine _",
    "cheese_. images generated using the above - mentioned methods show no discernible diffuse x - ray emission ( see figure  [ xrayradioimage ] ) .",
    "this is possibly because the exposure time was significantly shortened ( by more than 50% ) due to the proton flares during the observation .",
    "the objective of this paper is therefore to address the nature of the point sources , with specific focus on source 1 , which is very near the location of the  source .",
    "however , an attempt has been made to identify areas of snr x - ray emission through spectral analysis .",
    "this effort is described in   [ diffspec ] .      to identify the x - ray sources in the  observations ( both point sources and extended sources ) in the snr g107.5@xmath91.5 field , _ ewavelet _ , a wavelet detection algorithm which is part of the sas package , was used . for each source",
    ", the output of the routine gives the position on the image , source counts , and source extent ( fwhm ) , as well as errors in those quantities .",
    "the program also produces a reconstructed image of the detected sources , which can be subtracted from the original image to reveal any diffuse emission , as described in the previous section .",
    "point sources are identified by choosing sources at all wavelet scales with a significance of greater than 3@xmath10 and a less than 5 pixel extent ( fwhm ) , which corresponds to about 17 arcseconds , on the combined 0.52.5  kev and 2.510  kev images .",
    "this conservative requirement is based on the fact that off - axis sources have a larger psf than those toward the centre of the images .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at higher energies , and the 5 pixel extent limit corresponds to the approximate psf of a source at the highest energy at the edge of the field of view .",
    "the 18 sources with more than 25 counts from the source detection are shown in figure  [ xrayradioimageps ] as * magenta * or black circles .",
    "only source 3 was significantly detected on both the soft and hard images .",
    "the other sources were detected only in the soft - band image , with no detection or a detection of fewer than 25 counts on the hard image .",
    "source detection performed on the individual pn , mos1 , and mos2 images in those energy ranges yielded similar source lists .",
    "the 2xmmi catalogue @xcite contains the 18 sources described above , as well as 43 fainter point sources within the region covered by the observation .",
    "eight of the eighteen point sources indicated on figure  [ xrayradioimageps ] are sufficiently bright to have spectra of more than 100 counts extracted , and these are indicated as the numbered sources in figure  [ xrayradioimageps ] .",
    "table  [ pscat ] lists these sources with their * coordinates and positional errors .",
    "* source 1 , which is near the centre of the radio shell , has coordinates @xmath4(j2000 ) = 22h  52 m  00s.629 , @xmath11 ( j2000 ) = 57@xmath12  42@xmath13  59@xmath14.00 , with a positional error of 0@xmath14.5 , and is coincident with the unidentified  source 1rxs j225203.8 + 574249 and is furthermore identified as 2xmmi j225200.3 + 574259 ( see table [ pscat ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ psfitpow ]    as was done with the diffuse spectrum , as described in",
    "  [ diffspec ] , the @xmath15 was estimated to be 0.6 @xmath16 cm@xmath1 for sources associated with the snr , and for some of the blackbody and power law fits , the value of @xmath15 was frozen at this value .",
    "this was done in order to better constrain the fits , and to determine the spectral parameters for each source , assuming an association with the snr exists .",
    "some spectra were not fitted well with the absorption parameter frozen in this way , and those are not shown in the tables .    when the @xmath15 value was set to 0.6@xmath18 cm@xmath1 , the value of @xmath19 was greater than 2 for sources 5 and 6 for the absorbed blackbody fit , and source 5 for the absorbed power law fit , which indicates an unsatisfactory fit , but it is a possible value of @xmath15 for the rest of the sources .",
    "the error bars on the parameters are unfortunately very large for many of the sources , leading to large uncertainties in the flux values .",
    "it is unclear for many of the sources which of the models , blackbody , apec , or power law , is the best fit .    for the objects fitted with an absorbed blackbody model",
    ", the emitting radii can be determined , given the approximate distance of 1.1  kpc .",
    "the radii are given in the rightmost column of table  [ psfitbb ] and those for sources 1 , 2 , and 4 are close to typical neutron star radii .",
    "for many of the sources , the fit to an absorbed apec is of comparable quality with the fit to an absorbed power law or blackbody , indicating that neither the neutron star nor the coronal emission explanation can be ruled out .",
    "for the absorbed apec fit , sources 3 and 5 have unphysical kt values ( @xmath20 and @xmath21  kev ) and source 6 gives an unsatisfactory fit . for the absorbed blackbody or",
    "power law fits for the sources for which coronal emission can be ruled out , source 5 has an @xmath15 value too low to be associated with the remnant , and this is also true for the blackbody fit for source 6 .",
    "source 6 is well fitted with a power law at the distance of the remnant .",
    "however , the power law index of @xmath22 is very steep , ruling source 6 out as a neutron star candidate .",
    "because the pn observation was done in full window mode , the timing resolution of 70  ms limits pulsar searches to frequencies below approximately 7  hz , which would exclude all millisecond pulsars and many ordinary pulsars , but may identify slowly rotating magnetars known to have periods @xmath23  s. the maximum frequency is applicable only to pulsars with an approximately sinusoidal lightcurve ( i.e. a single peak per rotation ) .",
    "pulsars with lightcurves which have additional peaks or other features would likely not be found unless the frequency was much less than 3.6  hz . a negative result in a timing search",
    "thus does not indicate with any certainty that there is no pulsar present .    while producing the events file , the sas software showed a possible problem with the timing for quadrant 3 , involving jumps in the course timing parameter .",
    "this means that the timing for sources 3 and 4 may not have been reliable , and there is no way to fix the timing with the data from this observation .",
    "timing data from the other numbered sources would not have been affected by this .",
    "blind ( i.e. the frequency is not known beforehand ) timing searches were performed on the point sources of interest , including sources 3 and 4 . for these searches , an fft is first calculated , and then frequencies surrounding any significant peaks are searched using rayleigh @xcite ( also known as @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xcite , and epoch folding tests . only searches for frequencies of less than 1.8",
    "hz would have a sufficient number of bins per cycle ( 8) to reliably perform most of the tests .    *",
    "none of the point sources surrounding snr 107  showed evidence of detectable pulsations . *",
    "because of their proximity to the centre of the radio shell , and because they can be fitted with an @xmath15 value which conforms to the value for the snr , sources 1 and 2 are of particular interest for the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "all other sources investigated in this study are also ruled out as neutron star candidates associated with this remnant , because of their proximity to the shell , their fitted value of @xmath15 , and/or the lack of conformity between the individual spectra and both a power law and a blackbody .",
    "source 1 is a soft thermal source which is best fitted with an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of @xmath27  k , when @xmath15 is frozen at @xmath28  cm@xmath1 .",
    "its corresponding luminosity , assuming a distance of 1.1  kpc , is @xmath29  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "an absorbed power law fit to the spectrum of source 1 yields an unacceptably high value of @xmath19 , indicating that its spectrum is dominated by a thermal component .",
    "these values are qualitatively comparable with the spectral parameters and luminosity of the vela pulsar @xcite , and the age of 36  kyr is close to vela s characteristic age of 11  kyr , indicating that source 1 may be a vela - like pulsar . alternatively",
    ", this source could be a cco candidate , since the x - ray spectra of ccos are dominated by a thermal blackbody spectrum and have comparable luminosities ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the spectral analysis did not rule out the possibility that the x - ray emission from source 1 arises from the corona of a late - type star , however , and since it is unlikely to find such a bright star by chance , this likely rules out source 1 as a neutron star or cco .",
    "the fitted spectral parameters and proximity to the centre of the snr radio shell of source 2 are similar to those of source 1 , and it thus has similar merit as a neutron star candidate . similarly , coronal emission is not ruled out as producing the x - ray emission from source 2 , and since it does have a close optical and infrared counterpart , it is also likely ruled out as a neutron star or cco .",
    "source 1 appears in the  all - sky survey catalogue , but source 2 does not . since source 2 has a flux similar to that of source 1 , according to the present x - ray data , it is possible that it fell just short of inclusion in the rass .",
    "sources 1 and 2 are included in the  serendipitous source catalogue @xcite as 2xmmi j225200.3 + 574259 and j225236.3 + 574422 , respectively .    a deeper observation with higher angular resolution , such as with , would better allow closely - spaced x - ray sources to be distinguished , and would permit further spectroscopic study of the individual sources , particularly those that are too faint to have been studied in this paper . with more spectroscopic counts",
    ", multicomponent models could be used for the sources that do not fit well to simpler models , and source identification would be facilitated .",
    "in addition , with smaller x - ray error circles , association of x - ray sources with possible optical counterparts , such as that of source 1 with the nearby bright optical source , could be determined less ambiguously .",
    "timing observations for the as yet unidentified sources are also needed , and due to their proximity to each other , it would be possible to make a single   observation in small window mode which would include both sources and provide the timing resolution necessary for a pulsar search .    for x - ray detection of the diffuse emission from the snr , a deeper  observation near the center of the radio shell and including many of the point sources ( indicated with magenta circles on figure  [ xrayradioimageps ] ) for which spectral analysis was not possible with the available data , would be best .",
    "it is possible that , without the reduction in integration time caused by the proton flaring , diffuse x - ray emission from the snr would have been detected , so another  observation of the same duration or longer would be beneficial for a greater understanding of this low - surface brightness , highly polarized snr .",
