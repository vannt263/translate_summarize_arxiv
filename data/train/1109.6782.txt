    "<S> @xcite however , the analogy seems to be incomplete because the dynamics of the symmetric spinning top implies inertial effects ( e.g. nutation ) while for a uniformly magnetized body , the dynamics of the magnetization is described by the time variation of the magnetization @xmath3 ( i.e. the velocity ) and does not include the second derivative @xmath4 ( i.e. the acceleration ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in other terms , there is no inertia in the dynamic equation . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to push the analogy to its logical end with the introduction of inertia @xcite in the dynamics of uniform magnetization within the lagrangian formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> the precession of a uniform magnetic moment @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the magnetization at saturation and @xmath7 the radial unit vector ) under an effective magnetic field @xmath8 is often presented as a consequence of the gyromagnetic relation @xmath9 that links the magnetization to the angular momentum @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath10 is the gyromagnetic ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the gyromagnetic relation and the value of the constant @xmath11 can be justified in a basic _ atomic _ model of an electron of charge @xmath12 and mass @xmath13 orbiting around a nucleus . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite in the general case , with both spin and orbital contributions in condensed material , the gyromagnetic ratio writes @xmath14 where the @xmath15 factor accounts for the fact that the electron in a ferromagnet is a complex quasi particle . @xcite    using the gyromagnetic relation , the application of newton s second law @xmath16 leads directly to the precession equation @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> however the application of the newton s law to a rigid rotating body ( typically the spinning top in a gravitational field ) , leads to a more complex gyroscopic equation that contains inertial terms . </S>",

    "<S> this paradoxical situation can be clarified by re - introducing the inertia in the equation of the magnetization and explicitly going to the kinetic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> it is first useful to come back to the short history of the dynamic equation of the magnetization , especially with the introduction of the dissipation , since the precession equation @xmath17 can not account for the rapid relaxation toward the equilibrium state of the magnetization ( typically after a couple of precession cycles , i.e. after some nanoseconds , in usual ferromagnets ) . in 1935 </S>",
    "<S> landau and lifshitz proposed an equation for the dynamics of the magnetization that takes into account both the precession and the relaxation along the magnetic field : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a damping term ( defined below ) and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the basic argument used to derive the equation was to keep the modulus of the magnetization constant . </S>",
    "<S> the derivative @xmath21 is hence perpendicular to the vector @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> two decades later , after the development of ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) experiments @xcite and motivated by the observation of systematic deviations from the above equation for high damping , t. l. gilbert derived the equation that bears his name using a lagrangian formalism . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the dynamics of the magnetization is then described by the equation @xmath22 with the introduction of the damping coefficient @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> the landau - lifshitz equation and the gilbert equation are equivalent @xcite provided that @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dimensionless gilbert damping ( note that @xmath27 : this was the decisive improvement brought by gilbert to the landau - lifshitz proposition ) .    in line with previous works performed by w. dring , </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gilbert introduced the lagrangian of a uniform ferromagnet with a kinetic energy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the inertial tensor . </S>",
    "<S> he then chose an ad - hoc tensor of inertia in such a way that the inertial terms disappear from the dynamic equation ( i.e. such that the landau - lifshitz equation is recovered at the low damping limit ) . to do that </S>",
    "<S> , a sufficient condition is to set to zero the two first principal moments of inertia @xmath30 ( but keeping a non - zero kinetic energy : @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as pointed out by gilbert himself @xcite this puzzling condition does not seem to correspond to any realistic mechanical system ( see footnote 7 : `` _ i was unable to conceive of a physical object with an inertial tensor of this kind _ '' ) . in the subsequent report about gilbert s derivation , the ad - hoc and puzzling condition @xmath30 is explicitly stated despite its problematic character . in his presentation of the gilbert equation published in 1960 in the _ american journal of physics _ </S>",
    "<S> , @xcite brown wrote `` _ we treat the rotating moment system as a symmetric top , with principal moments of inertia @xmath32 , @xmath33 . for a top made of classical mass particles </S>",

    "<S> , we can read : `` _ a lagrangian function , @xmath39 , consistent with the accepted equation of motion ( equation ( 10 - 3.2 ) ) can be obtained by considering the magnetic system as a classical top with principal moments of inertia @xmath40 ... _ '' . in our notation @xmath38 , and </S>",
    "<S> the equation ( 10 - 3.2 ) is @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the mechanical approach is not presented as a realistic physical model ( as it should , according to the gyromagnetic relation ) , but seems to be introduced as a pedagogical analogy of an unspecified non - classical theory , that would give a physical interpretation to the puzzling gilbert s condition . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this strange condition is presented as a specific property of the magnetic moments that would be due to the fact that \" _ this top is not made of classical mass particles \" _ .    </S>",
    "<S> this is probably the reason why , after more than half a century of intensive use of the gilbert s equation , the full derivation following gilbert s approach - with the complete set of principal moments of inertia ( i.e. without ad - hoc assumption ) - has not been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite for recent presentations of the gilbert s derivation ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as will be shown below , this derivation can be performed at an elementary level , as a direct application of the lagrangian formalism . </S>",
    "<S> although straightforward , this derivation is very instructive because it shows that the puzzling condition @xmath42 is not necessary to obtain the gilbert equation . instead , the gilbert s condition is replaced by the necessary physical condition under which a diffusion process can be described by a non - inertial diffusion equation . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is the usual kinetic limit that results in the requirement that the typical measurement times should be longer than the relaxation time @xmath2 of the momentum ( here for the angular momentum @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this picture , the precession with damping is simply a diffusion process in a field of force , for which the angular momentum has reached its equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this change of paradigm has two consequences . </S>",
    "<S> a first important consequence is that an inertial regime of uniform magnetic dipoles is expected , and should be observed at short enough time scales . </S>",
    "<S> second , the classical mechanical approach is much more than a pedagogical analogy , and it could be used ( beyond the gyromagnetic relation ) for a deeper understanding of non - equilibrium magnetomechanics and related processes . </S>"
