    "one finds that these modes are unstable for @xmath76 this instability is intimately related to the self regulating nature of the dynamics .",
    "it arises from the density dependence of the local tendency of the system to build up polar order , @xmath14 , and the fact that this density dependence is rendered nonlocal by the convective coupling of density to @xmath77 proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",

    "we want to emphasize two features of this instability relevant for this work : i ) this instability is mainly controlled by the third term in eq .   and as such is model independent and arises purely due to the convective coupling between the collective velocity and density ; ii ) as the order - disorder transition is approached from above @xmath81 and @xmath82 , i.e. , near @xmath15 the mean - field ordered state becomes unstable for vanishingly small @xmath3 .",

    "we have identified two mechanisms that render the system linearly unstable and lead to growth of density fluctuations . in the next section , we go beyond the linear stability analysis and use detailed numerical computations to characterize the spatially ( and possibly temporally ) inhomogeneous states that replace the homogeneous solution in the unstable region of parameters .",

    "is unstable and two steady , inhomogeneous states are obtained : ( i ) propagating stripes comprised of ordered swarms moving through a disordered background , when active convection exceeds the strength of nonlinearities @xmath93 , and ( ii ) a stationary aster when non - linear effects dominate convection @xmath94 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the mechanisms underlying the formation of these two emergent structures .    , the density ( pink in online version ) and @xmath95 and @xmath96 the polarization fields ( blue and green online ) are plotted for a striped state when @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath0 .",

    "for values of @xmath3 above the critical value for the onset of the convective density instability , defined by eq .  , an initially homogeneous state develops hot - spots of high density that are then convected throughout the system due to the coupling between @xmath77 and @xmath101 .",
    "these high density regions reorganize and grow in the direction lateral to their motion due to diffusion , resulting in the formation of high density , highly ordered planar stripes propagating at a speed of order @xmath3 through a low density , disordered background .",
    "it is important to stress the properties of these stripes : i ) they are not a pattern in that the width and spacing of the stripes is not fixed but rather determined by initial conditions and domain size - they are instead solitonic wavefronts ; ii ) the propagation speed @xmath102 is of the order of @xmath3 and weakly dependent on the base density of the system ; iii ) the bands are bounded by two sharp fronts - a leading , narrow boundary layer and a wider and more slowly decaying trailing boundary layer ( see fig .",

    "this phenomenology is the same as that found in  @xcite .",
    "* mechanism .",
    "* the propagating stripe state exists even when we set @xmath4 to zero .",
    "in addition , the onset of the striped state follows closely the neutral stability line associated with the convection mediated density instability determined by eq .",
    "[ l - inst ] .",
    "thus , a minimum dynamical model for the emergence of this structure is given by the two coupled equations @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the two coupled equations are effectively equivalent to a wave equation where the homogeneous nonlinear terms from the polarization equation provide the dispersion that generates the solitary wave structure . after transforming to a co - moving frame , the equations can be reduced to quadrature to determine the speed of propagation and the profile of the wavefront .",
    "such an analysis has already been reported in  @xcite . here , we present a complementary point of view .",
    "as stated earlier , the convection mediated density instability occurs in the vicinity of @xmath15 .",
    "the polar ordered state is re - stabilized at higher densities . in this unstable regime ,",
    "the dynamics of the system essentially yields a phase separation into a high density ordered state and a low density disordered state , both of which are now stable ( see fig .  [ phase - separation ] ) .",

    "@xcite yielded the conclusion that local polar aligning interactions among the filaments are necessary for the emergence of the propagating waves .",
    "these interactions need not be medium mediated and could arise from the fact that aligned actin filaments have very anisotropic friction constants for sliding along the direction of alignment when compared to sliding against it  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion indicates that the propagating waves seen in actin motility assays are indeed the propagating stripes obtained in the present model of polar self - propelled particles due to the dynamic self - regulation of the collective motility .",
    "pattern formation in bacterial suspensions , in contrast , are controlled by the presence of gradients of signaling chemicals and nutrients and have been traditionally modeled in terms of coupled reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "recent work has shown that some patterns in chemotactic bacteria can be explained by accounting for the fact that the bacterial motility depends on density @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "we want to focus on the so - called _ keller - segal bands _ , extensively studied in the bacteria literature .",
    "they arise from self - chemotaxis and are the predominant emergent structure in convection free geometries @xcite .",
    "the alignment interaction among bacteria in these systems scales with the concentration of the chemoattractant , which is in turn proportional to the concentration of bacteria . in this respect",
    "the alignment interaction is similar to the model considered here , where the local ordering tendency is controlled by @xmath112 that depends on the concentration of self - propelled particles",
    ". there is , however , an important difference between the two systems in that in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite and related studies , the direction of propagation of the bands is set by the nutrient gradient in the microchannel , hence the rotational symmetry is externally broken . in the model considered here ,",
    "in contrast , the symmetry is broken spontaneously . however , we note that the fact that a symmetry is spontaneously broken is encoded in the dynamics of the associated goldstone mode and the analysis here shows that the goldstone mode plays no role in the dynamics that give rise to the concentration waves . hence , the keller - segal bands are also another realization of dynamic self - regulation in self - propelled particle flows .",

    "the total momentum is conserved and important nonequilibrium effects arise from the coupling of the associated flow velocity and local orientational order , as shown in recent work  @xcite .",
    "a second limitation is the one elastic constant approximation that identifies the energy cost for bend and splay",
    ". theoretical work on models of suspensions of cytoskeletal filaments has shown the importance of retaining different elastic constants for bend and splay to understand the emergence of vortices and spirals @xcite .",
    "this physics is missing in the present model .",
    "finally , we note that aster formation has also been observed in related continuum models when the sign of pressure gradients tends to favor the formation of high density regions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , asters were not found in refs .",
    "@xcite , even though the continuum equations considered there have the same structure as those analyzed here .",
    "the reason for this is that refs .",
    "@xcite study the continuum model obtained by systematic coarse - graining of specific microscopic models ( the vicsek model and a collection of self - propelled hard rods , respectively ) and use the microscopic expressions for the parameters obtained in such derivations .",
    "in both cases the microscopic calculation yields @xmath145 .",
    "in other words @xmath4 is not an independent parameter and can not be tuned to the large values required to obtain asters .",
    "the simplicity and generic nature of the theory considered in this study has enabled us to highlight the role of dynamic self regulation and to show that the mechanism is universal and does not depend on the microscopic physics , in contrast to closely related albeit system specific studies such as those in refs .",
