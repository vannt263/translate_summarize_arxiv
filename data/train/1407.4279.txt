    "in contrast to epitaxial layers , single - crystal gan can be grown on si substrates as well as on amorphous substrates in the form of nanowires with diameters ranging typically between 30 and 100  nm.@xcite the high crystal quality of gan nanowires facilitates the investigation of fundamental aspects of these nanostructures by purely optical means , such as the role of the surface on their spontaneous emission.@xcite these studies have shown that the nanowire surface may affect both the radiative and nonradiative recombination processes of excitons .    concerning the latter process , surface recombination has been reported to be the dominant recombination process in gan nanowires with a diameter of 30 nm or thinner @xcite despite the fact that the dangling bond states for the nonpolar surfaces of gan are situated far from midgap.@xcite regarding the former process , both the wavefunction and energy of electrons and excitons bound to point defects are altered in the vicinity of a surface.@xcite this surface - induced change of the properties of point defects leads to a distribution of the emission energy of donor - bound excitons in nanowires@xcite and to a modification of the lifetimes of the different radiative transitions involved as compared to the bulk case.@xcite the pinning of the fermi level at the sidewalls of nanowires@xcite adds further complexity to nanowire - based systems . as shown in ref .",
    ", this pinning induces radial electric fields within the nanowires and is responsible for their electrical depletion .",
    "the consequences of these surface potentials are manifold .",
    "for example , they modify the radiative decay rate of excitons@xcite and enhance the coupling between free and bound excitons with profound consequences for the exciton decay dynamics.@xcite in ( in , ga)n / gan nanowire heterostructures , the interplay between the polarization and surface potentials may lead to a radial separation of electron and holes , resulting in a dramatic decrease of the internal quantum efficiency in the blue spectral range.@xcite    to understand these phenomena , a detailed knowledge of the distribution and the magnitude of surface - induced electric fields as a function of the doping level ( n@xmath4 ) and the nanowire diameter ( @xmath5 ) is indispensable .",
    "furthermore , we need to understand the transition between the single impurity limit for nanowires with a low background doping and small diameters,@xcite and the bulk - like case of a homogeneous dopant distribution reached for intentionally doped@xcite or very large nanowires.@xcite    in this paper , we present experimental results demonstrating that very high growth temperatures can induce the incorporation of si into gan nanowires grown on si substrates , but can simultaneously result in a sub - mev linewidth of the donor - bound exciton transition for the ensemble . to understand these results",
    ", we investigate the role of the surface on the properties of donors in gan nanowires theoretically . using a combination of monte - carlo and envelope function calculations ,",
    "we examine the validity of assuming a parabolic potential across the section of nanowires . we compute the binding energy of donors in the presence of surface - induced electric fields and discuss the doping- and diameter ranges for which neutral surface donors are stable and for which they are not .",
    "we find that neutral surface donors capable of binding excitons do not exist already for moderate doping levels ( for example ,",
    "@xmath1  @xmath2 for a nanowire diameter of 100  nm ) , which explains the record linewidths observed experimentally .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] is devoted to the experimental methods used in this work . in section [ sec : pl ] , the photoluminescence spectra of gan nanowires grown on si at a temperature of 870@xmath6c are presented . in section [ sec : parabolicpotential ] , we present monte - carlo simulations which provide the range of values for @xmath5 and @xmath7 for which it is valid to approximate the radial potential across a nanowire by a parabola . in section [ sec : bindingenergy ] , we calculate the binding energy of donors located at the nanowire surface , in the presence of surface - induced electric fields . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we compare the results of our calculations with the experiments in section [ sec : pl ]",

    "subsequently , the substrate temperature was set to the desired value for growth , and the substrate was exposed to the n plasma for 10  min before opening the ga shutter to induce the spontaneous formation of gan nanowires .",
    "a series of samples was prepared using growth temperatures between 785 and 870c .",
    "for all samples the active n flux provided by the radio frequency n plasma source was kept constant at @xmath9  s@xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , the impinging ga flux provided by a solid - source effusion cell was increased from @xmath12 to @xmath13   s@xmath10@xmath11 to compensate for the exponential increase in ga desorption with increasing temperature.@xcite due to the high ga desorption rate , the actual growth conditions were invariably n - rich as required for the spontaneous formation of gan nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy.@xcite the nanowires thus obtained have similar average lengths ( 23  m ) , mean diameters ( 70-130  nm ) , densities ( @xmath14  @xmath11 ) and coalescence degrees.@xcite    photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed by exciting these gan nanowire ensembles with the 325  nm line of a continuous - wave hecd laser .",
    "the laser beam was attenuated with neutral density filters to a power of about 15  nw and was focused to a 1  m - spot using a near - uv objective with a numerical aperture of 0.45 .",
    "we estimate that about 40 nanowires are excited simultaneously .",

    "the shoulders on the high - energy side of the ( o@xmath15,x@xmath16 ) line are due to the emission from b excitons bound to neutral o donors [ ( o@xmath15,x@xmath17 ) ] at 3.4743  ev and from free a excitons ( x@xmath16 ) at 3.4775  ev .",

    "this broadening arises from both the microstrain introduced by nanowire coalescence@xcite and the modification of the energy and the wavefunction of neutral donors and donor - bound excitons by the surface , as discussed in refs .  .",
    "figure [ fig : figureplandsem](b ) displays a cross - sectional scanning electron micrograph of the interface between the gan nanowires and the si substrate for a sample grown at a temperature of 870c .",
    "a common phenomenon during the high - temperature growth of gan on si is the melt - back etching of the si substrate.@xcite this etching process arises from the formation of a ga - si eutectic alloy and results in the creation of large pits in the substrate . for our sample series , we observed these pits for growth temperatures higher than 850c .    the photoluminescence spectrum of the sample shown in fig .",

    "this line corresponds in energy to the recombination of a excitons bound to neutral si donors on ga sites [ ( si@xmath15,x@xmath16 ) ] , suggesting that the melt - back etching of the si substrate is accompanied by the incorporation of si in the nanowires .",
    "the incorporation of si also manifests itself by an increase in the emission intensity of excitons bound to i@xmath18 basal - plane stacking faults as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figureplandsem](b ) ] .",
    "in fact , the formation energy for stacking faults in gan is reduced with increasing si concentration as demonstrated theoretically by @xcite .",
    "finally , we observe a significant reduction in the linewidth of the donor - bound exciton lines for all samples grown above 850c .",
    "for the nanowire ensemble grown at 870@xmath6c , full - width at half - maxima of 400 and 500  @xmath19ev are measured for the ( o@xmath15,x@xmath16 ) and ( si@xmath15,x@xmath16 ) lines , respectively .",
    "all samples grown at or above 850@xmath6c exhibit this correlation between the occurence of si meltback - etching , a strong ( si@xmath15,x@xmath16 ) transition , and sub - mev donor - bound exciton linewidths .",

    "<S> we observe unusually narrow donor - bound exciton transitions ( 400  ev ) in the photoluminescence spectra of gan nanowire ensembles grown on si(111 ) substrates at very high ( @xmath0c ) temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of these samples reveal a prominent transition of excitons bound to neutral si impurities which is not observed for samples grown under standard conditions . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these experimental results , we investigate theoretically the impact of surface - induced internal electric fields on the binding energy of donors by a combined monte carlo and envelope function approach . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the ranges of doping and diameter for which the potential is well described using the poisson equation , where one assumes a spatially homogeneous distribution of dopants . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations also show that surface donors in nanowires with a diameter smaller than 100  nm are ionized when the surface electric field is larger than about 10  kv / cm , corresponding to a doping level higher than @xmath1  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this result explains the experimental observation : since the ( d@xmath3,x ) complex is not stable in gan , surface - donor - bound excitons do not contribute to the photoluminescence spectra of gan nanowires above a certain doping level , and the linewidth reflects the actual structural perfection of the nanowire ensemble . </S>"
