    "* we have derived the formula for escape velocity of the particles , after collision . * the equations of motion have been solved numerically and we have plotted the radial velocity of the particle . * the lyapunov exponent , which gives the instability time scale for the geodesics of the particle , is calculated .",
    "therefore we have concluded that the instability of the circular orbits around schwarzschild black hole is more compared to kiselev solution , in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "* we have derived the effective force acting on the particle due to dark energy and mentioned the conditions under which the force is attractive or repulsive .",
