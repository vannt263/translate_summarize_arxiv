    "over the past two decades a series of novel superconductors have been discovered bridging the gap between the conventional low @xmath2 superconductors and high @xmath2 cuprates .",
    "these materials include boro - carbides , @xmath3 , pnictides and many others .",
    "while the conventional metallic superconductors are adequately explained by the phonon coupled bcs pairing mechanism , now there appears several proposals to address various anomalous features in the novel superconductors .",
    "some are attempted with a modified bcs mechanism ( involving both phonon and non - phonon ) and others are radically different propositions ( resonance valance bond , marginal fermi liquid etc . ) .",
    "the new features of unconventional / novel superconductors involve some of the following : ( a ) many of them are quasi-2d or 3d materials , ( b ) superconducting properties are anisotropic ,",
    "( c ) fermi surfaces are much more complicated involving many bands of electronic structure , ( d ) a variety of superconducting gap symmetries ( singlet or triplet and s - wave , p - wave and d - wave ) are confirmed by angle - resolved photo - emission and tunnelling probes and ( e ) control of superconducting @xmath2 by ` doping ' into the parent materials .",
    "we avoid these broad range of issues in this paper and focus on one important aspect : how the inter - band coupling in multi - band superconductors can give rise to some novel physics . before we dwell on the technicality of more exotic states based on the symmetry of the phases , we present a brief appraisal of the multi - band superconductors .",
    "suhl et al .",
    "@xcite and moskalenko @xcite independently extended the one band bcs theory with overlapping of energy bands on the fermi surface .",
    "the two - band theory was further discussed by kondo @xcite and tilley @xcite , where the solutions are obtained by using bogoliubov s variational and gorkov s techniques respectively .",
    "additionally tilley derived ginzburg - landau eqns in the two band case following the method of gorkov .",
    "the two - band model has been explored intensely starting with the work of geilikman et al .",
    "other authors used this model in the context of high @xmath2 oxides @xcite and mgb@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of the later topic is presented by brandt and das @xcite .",
    "a new phenomenon was discovered to exist in multi - band superconductors by leggett @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where a collective oscillation was predicted due to small fluctuations in the relative phases of two order parameters .",
    "this oscillation appears because the total energy of the system not only is dependent on the relative phases , but also on its canonical conjugate variable , the relative density of the bands .",
    "the inter - band coupling in this case is the internal josephson coupling usually written as @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the strength of coupling , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are amplitude and phase of the energy gap .",
    "search for leggett modes have been pursued with no clear success @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the gaps @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the anomalous green functions , are taken to be even functions of time .",
    "their fourier transforms , therefore , are even functions of frequency , @xmath11 . for sufficiently strong exchange interactions berezinskii",
    "@xcite showed a novel pairing state having triplet spin and even orbital angular momentum , @xmath12 .",
    "this led to @xmath13 and @xmath14 being odd functions of @xmath15 and @xmath11 , a strangely different property unlike the conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "abrahams et al.@xcite have pointed out that for electron - phonon interaction in metals , the odd frequency state can not exist due to renormalisation of the net interaction , but with anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuations the odd frequency state seems to be a clear possibility .",
    "symmetry of the superconducting gap under time reversal for various spin and orbital angular momenta channels give rise to many novel superconducting classes ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "physics of pair tunnelling with different gap parameters in multi - band systems has opened up a new paradigm in the current research .    in three band superconductors",
    ", a chiral state appears as a new possibility for a ground state , termed the time - reversal - symmetry - broken ( trsb ) state @xcite .",
    "chiral superconductivity occurs due to the competition of attractive and repulsive inter - band interactions @xcite , allowing the inter - band phase differences to take on values other than @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the trsb state is then doubly degenerate , with the complex conjugate of the ground state having the same energy . in this state",
    ", novel arrangements can appear due to variations in this phase difference , including skyrmions@xcite , fractional vortices , and phase solitons .    in this paper",
    "we report a modified bcs theory for the multi - band case and consider in particular a 3-band model for pure superconductors .",
    "the superconducting gap amplitudes on the different sheets of the fermi surface give rise to multi - gap phenomena .",
    "unlike in the two - band case , where the inter - band coupling always enhances the superconducting gaps and the transition temperature , the transition temperature of a three - band superconductor can be enhanced or reduced , depending on the sign and magnitude of inter - band couplings .",
    "because of multi - band gaps ( amplitudes and phases ) being different , a variety of novel phenomena are expected .",
    "some of these details constitute the core of this paper . in sec 2",
    "we outline the multi - band bcs theory and show numerical solution of the gaps as a function of @xmath16 . in sec 3 we discuss time reversal broken symmetry state and the phase diagram of three band superconductors . in sec 4 . our results and",
    "a summary is presented .",
    "to generalise the bcs theory to multi - band superconductors , a band index @xmath17 is added to the electron operators and the bands are coupled by an interband josephson coupling term .",
    "the hamiltonian is written in momentum space as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy of the non interacting state , @xmath20 indicates the spin state , @xmath21 is the band index , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are the electron annihilation ( creation ) operators in momentum space , @xmath24 is the chemical potential , @xmath25 is the general momentum dependent intraband ( @xmath26 ) and interband ( @xmath27 ) coupling strengths .",
    "the hamiltonian is also written in real space as @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the electron annihilation ( creation ) operators in real space , @xmath31 is the vector potential , @xmath32 is the effective mass of the electron in the band @xmath17 , @xmath33 is the effective interband coupling constant , and it is implicitly assumed that all real space integrals must be cut off in momentum space at the debye frequency , @xmath34 .    in the absence of an external magnetic field , the superconducting gap satisfies the self - consistent gap equations , which are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a vector containing the gap in each band , @xmath37 is the effective interband coupling matrix , and @xmath38 is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the density of states of each band at the fermi surface .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath2 , occurs when there is a non trivial solution to these equations .",
    "this temperature is found as the largest temperature when the following determinant is zero @xmath41=0,\\ ] ] where now the integral is the same for all bands with the approximate solution @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath34 is the debye frequency .",
    "for the three band bcs , @xmath2 is the largest solution to the equation @xmath44    we can also calculate @xmath45 , the gap at zero temperature . in this limit",
    "the integral can be performed exactly with the result @xmath46    then the gap at @xmath47 is found by solving the set of equations @xmath48    numerical solutions for a three band case over all @xmath49 are shown in fig  ( [ fig : threebandwithtstar3gap ] ) .",
    "for this plot we use the parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 . with these parameters",
    ", a kink appears in the gap at about @xmath58 .",
    "this kink is more pronounced in the smallest gap , but is present in all three bands .",
    "above this temperature , the phase difference between the gaps must either be @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "in this region the superconductor is in a conventional bcs state .",
    "below this point @xmath59 the phase difference will be between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the superconductor is in the trsb state ( also see @xcite ) .    .",
    "below this point the superconductor is in the time - reversal - symmetry - broken state.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "for a three - band superconductor , most solutions of the self - consistent multi - band bcs equations have the three gaps either in phase or out of phase with each other .",
    "however , for some input parameters and below a critical temperature @xmath60 , there exists a solution to the bcs self - consistent equations ( eq [ eq : multibandbcsvectoreqn ] ) where the three bands have relative phases other than @xmath0 or @xmath1 due to frustration of the interaction between the three gap functions .",
    "these gap functions are therefore described by a complex amplitude even in the uniform case .",
    "when this happens the ground state is doubly degenerate because the complex conjugate of the gap functions is also a solution to eq ( [ eq : multibandbcsvectoreqn ] ) .",
    "the gap functions are therefore in a chiral ground state , and the time - reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "considering the gap functions as vectors in the complex plane ( see fig  ( [ fig : arrow ] ) ) , we see that the two possible ground states have different chirality .",
    "this induces a breaking of the mirror symmetry in the phase plane , which also induces the breaking of the time - reversal - symmetry .",
    "here we show how to calculate the magnitude of the gap in the trsb state in terms of a set of single band bcs gap equations , and find the condition for the appearance of the trsb state .",
    "for the three - band case , the self - consistent bcs equations ( eq ( [ eq : multibandbcsvectoreqn ] ) ) can be written in matrix form as @xmath61 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\delta_1\\\\ \\delta_2\\\\ \\delta_3 \\end{array } \\right]={\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{0}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where there is an arbitrary global phase .",
    "we can choose the global phase such that @xmath62 .",
    "then , taking the imaginary part , we find @xmath63",
    "\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\mathrm{im}(\\delta_2)\\\\ \\mathrm{im}(\\delta_3 ) \\end{array } \\right]={\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{0}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] + .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if we are interested in the time - reversal symmetry broken states , then the imaginary components of these gaps must be non - zero .",
    "hence the determinant of the matrix must equal zero .",
    "we will denote a magnitude of the gap that satisfies this requirement @xmath64 .",
    "this leads to the constraint equation @xmath65 we can make similar demands for the other gaps , resulting in two other similar conditions .",
    "these have the solution @xmath66 for all permutations @xmath67 , which are now decoupled single - band bcs self - consistent equations for the superconducting gaps with modified interaction strengths .",
    "since the trsb state is only stable when one or all three coupling parameters are negative , @xmath68 , resulting in frustrated repulsive interactions between the bands , we only need to keep the negative solution .",
    "we can now substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : onebandbcscoupling ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : threebandselfconsistantmatrixform ] ) to find @xmath69 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\overline{\\delta_1}\\\\ \\overline{\\delta_2}\\\\ \\overline{\\delta_3 } \\end{array } \\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which results in a single condition which must be met for a stable solution .",
    "this can be rewritten in the form @xmath70 where the @xmath64 are complex with unknown phase differences .",
    "the existence of a solution to this constraint equation is only possible if the triangle inequality @xmath71 holds for all permutations of @xmath72 . in this way we can find the existence and position of the time - reversal - symmetry breaking by finding the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : onebandbcscoupling ] ) , then finding the regions over which eq .",
    "( [ eq : triangleinequality ] ) holds .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig : tstarconditions ] ) we perform this procedure explicitly with the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath54 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "this set of parameters are arbitrary , yet reasonable for a three band case .",
    "similar results are found with other parameters .",
    "figure ( a ) shows a direct multi - band solution to the bcs equations , @xmath14 , plotted with the one - band reduced bcs solutions , @xmath78 . in figure ( b ) the triangle inequality for the three permutations are plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "these plots show that in the region where the inequalities hold , the multi - band solution is precisely the solution @xmath78 . at the point where the inequality is no longer satisfied",
    "there is a kink in the multi - band solution as it ceases to be in the trsb state .",
    "the point where the equality holds is the critical transition point @xmath60 , and is the point that separates the trsb state from the conventional bcs state .    at the point @xmath60",
    ", the full multi - gap solution separates from the reduced one band solution with a discontinuity in the derivative of the gaps .",
    "this discontinuity would lead to a jump in the heat capacity of the superconductor and other experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "looking at the trsb triangle inequality ( eq ( [ eq : triangleinequality ] ) ) , we see that there can be points above @xmath60 where the permutation below zero changes sign , and another permutation drops below zero . at the point where they cross , the triangle inequality holds as an equality for the two permutations , and therefore the solution is again the reduced one - band bcs solution .",
    "as one of the one - band solutions is zero at this point , this allows is the phase of this gap to change relative to the other two .",
    "we denote this point @xmath79 , and note that this point can be seen most readily as a phase discontinuity .",
    "with the choice of a base set of parameters , we can vary a single parameter and observe the effect on the magnitude and relative phase of the gaps , as well as on the critical temperature @xmath2 , the presence of the trsb state , and the existence of a @xmath79 point .",
    "we first choose the case where the parameters of all the bands are equal other than the parameter @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : equalbandphasediagram ] ) ) .",
    "we choose the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . in this case",
    "the parameter space divides into four regimes : at the top is the normal state , on the right is the simple three band superconductivity , bottom left is the trsb state , and at the top left the first band is identically zero , so that two band superconductivity remains here .",
    "these four regions are separated by the phase transition lines @xmath2 and @xmath60 , which touch at the point @xmath84 , which coincides with a minimum in @xmath2 .    due to bands 2 and 3 being identical",
    ", we see that the trsb state continues to exist to @xmath85 , since any non - zero value for @xmath86 will satisfy the triangle inequality",
    ". moreover , when @xmath87 the triangle inequality is still satisfied as an equality , and thus the condition for @xmath79 is satisfied in the entire region above @xmath60 left of the point @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the gap in the first band @xmath86 equals zero in this region , and the phase difference for bands @xmath89 and @xmath90 is flipped to account for the repulsive interaction between these bands .",
    "next we look at the case where the parameters in all three bands are nearly equal ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : nearlyequalbandphasediagram ] ) ) .",
    "here we set @xmath73 , @xmath81 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 . with these parameters",
    "the two - band superconductivity regime disappears , the trsb regime is confined to a finite region , and a gap opens between the @xmath60 line and the @xmath2 line .",
    "the two - band superconductivity regime disappears due to the finite difference between the bands @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , as the temperature is increased , the @xmath98 term eventually becomes too small to satisfy the triangle inequality , and is therefore no longer forced to zero for the majority of this region .",
    "however , it remains heavily suppressed .",
    "the finite region containing the trsb state is also a consequence of the finite difference between the bands @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "as the coupling @xmath80 is moved to @xmath99 , it enhances @xmath100 and @xmath101 equally , and hence the difference between them , while @xmath98 approaches a constant .",
    "therefore , at some critical value of @xmath80 , the magnitude of @xmath98 is too small to satisfy the triangle inequality , even at @xmath47 , and so the trsb state disappears .",
    "the gap opens between the @xmath60 line and the @xmath2 line because for these two points to touch there must be a location where all the terms in the triangle inequality are identical for all temperatures such that the trsb state can extend all the way to @xmath2 . however , the @xmath2 and @xmath60 lines are connected by two @xmath79 lines , one where @xmath102 , and one where @xmath103 .",
    "these lines are most easily seen in the phase plots as a sudden jump from a phase difference of @xmath0 to @xmath1 or vice versa , but the line for @xmath104 is also visible in the magnitude plot .",
    "we also note that the trsb state is mainly found near the minimum in @xmath2 .",
    "finally we look for a set of parameters that results in only a single @xmath79 line .",
    "we find that the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath105 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 create this behaviour ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : onet0linephasediagram ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath79 line is again most easily seen in the phase plots , which show that in this case it is @xmath97 which goes to zero in this case .    the first gap is again suppressed in the upper left region , as was the case in the previous examples .",
    "the trsb state again appears only near the minimum in @xmath2 .    in summary",
    ", we have looked at the novel trsb state in three - band superconductors .",
    "this state is a result of frustrated repulsive interactions among the three bands which gives rise to a relative phase appearing between the bands .",
    "we have shown the behaviour of the gaps as a function of temperature and showed that there is a kink in the band gaps at the critical temperature @xmath60 .",
    "below @xmath60 , the gaps are described by a set of single - band bcs equations , but above this point the full multi - band bcs equations must be solved directly .",
    "we have also looked at the behaviour of three - band superconductors as the inter - band coupling is varied .",
    "this showed that the trsb state only appears in a very small region of parameter space , where the interactions between the bands are of similar order .",
    "this allows the frustrated repulsive interaction to form the trsb state .",
    "the frustrated repulsion also results in a lowering of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 , and thus we expect to find these interesting properties near the minimum of @xmath2 in parameter space .",
    "finally , we have shown that there is a possible phase transition between the trsb and conventional bcs states at a finite temperature which can be experimentally probed .",
