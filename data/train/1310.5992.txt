    "fifteen years ago this year , the superkamiokande collaboration presented a talk titled `` evidence for @xmath0 oscillations '' at the neutrino 1998 conference @xcite .",
    "this set the particle physics world `` abuzz '' since , if neutrinos change flavor , it implies that their clocks are ticking and therefore they can not be traveling at the speed of light .",
    "hence neutrinos have mass .",
    "fast forward fifteen years and the evidence for neutrino flavor conversion is overwhelming . the simplest and only satisfactory description of all the data is that neutrinos have distinct masses and mix . two distinct baseline ( l ) divided by neutrino energy ( e ) scales",
    "have been identified corresponding to two distinct @xmath1 for the neutrino mass eigenstates : @xmath2 these are known as the atmospheric and solar scales , respectively .    since it is most likely that the higgs boson has been discovered at the lhc , it is natural to ask how the neutrinos couple to the higgs boson .",
    "first , what is `` mass '' for a fermion ? it is a coupling of the right and left components of the field , and for the neutrino this coupling depends on whether the neutrino is a dirac particle , like all the other fermions in the standard model or a majorana fermion , which would make the neutrino unique amongst the particles of the standard model .",
    "the couplings for both dirac and majorana @xcite neutrinos are given in the following table : +    [ cols=\">,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     processes across the diagonal are related by cpt .",
    "the first row will be explored in very powerful conventional beams , t2k @xcite , no@xmath3a @xcite , superbeams , hyperk @xcite , lbne @xcite , essnusb @xcite , whereas the second row could be explored in nu - factories @xcite or beta beams @xcite .    in vacuum ,",

    "there are a number of experiments that are taking data or are planned to address these anomalies .",
    "these include    * reactor and source experiments looking at the l / e depends for @xmath48 and @xmath62 . * @xmath50 disappearance experiments with both near and far detectors . * @xmath63 or @xmath64 appearance experiments .",
    "one of the more ambitious experiments is nustorm @xcite , which stores muons in a racetrack shaped ring providing a source of @xmath22 with essentially no contamination from other neutrino flavors .",
    "such an experiment could exclude the lsnd allowed region at about 10@xmath58 and would also be a useful source for measuring neutrino cross sections as the neutrino flux can be calculated from the decaying muon flux with high precision .",
    "such an experiment is a first step on the way to a neutrino factory @xcite and maybe a muon collider @xcite in the future .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana in nature and cp violation is observed in neutrino oscillation then the credibility of leptogenesis will be greatly enhanced .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments can not only measure cp violation but can also determine whether the atmospheric mass hierarchy is normal or inverted and can determine whether the @xmath0 flavor content is more or less than the @xmath65 content for the neutrino mass eignestate with the smallest amount of @xmath22 .",
    "the precise measurement of the neutrino mixing and mass parameters will allow us to test the various models predicting these parameters and may lead to a more complete understanding of this notoriously difficult physics problem .",
    "if the mass of the lightest neutrino , is significantly smaller than the square root of the solar @xmath66 then there is a new scale in particle physics that needs to be explained .",
    "finally , neutrinos have surprised us in the past and are expected to do so in the future . where are these surprises ? are there light sterile neutrinos ?",
    "do neutrinos decay ? what is the size of non - standard interactions ?",
    "will lhc find new physics related to neutrino mass ?",
    "only the results from further experiments will provide us the answer to these most important questions !",
