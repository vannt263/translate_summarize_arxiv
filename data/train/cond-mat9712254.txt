    "the coherent manipulation of the atomic center of mass motion in optical lattices @xcite by means of the nonstationary off - resonant dipole potentials has provided new experimental capabilities to study dynamical systems with time - dependent potentials @xcite-@xcite . in the off - resonant coherent regime ,",
    "the parametric non - adiabatic excitations of the optical lattice give rise to oscillations of the atomic momentum and coordinate distribution dispersions ( breathing modes ) @xcite and may be used for the manipulation of the coordinate or momentum dispersions of the atomic distribution by means of squeezing in phase space @xcite .",
    "the squeezed states of matter in various systems have been extensively discussed in connection with the possibility of overcoming the standard quantum limit for noise imposed by vacuum fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in an optical lattice , the squeezing effect can be significant in the classical regime producing classical squeezed states @xcite and resulting in the reduction of thermal fluctuations .",
    "recently , the breathing modes of atomic oscillations in the optical lattices have been observed experimentally with the use of the bragg scattering techniques based on the fact that the cross section of the bragg diffraction scales with the debye - waller factor which is related to the dispersion of the atomic coordinate distribution @xcite .",
    "the observed decay of the oscillations may be due to both the dissipative and the dephasing effects .    in classical oscillating systems with anharmonicity",
    "the frequencies have a continuous distribution due to the energy - dependent corrections .",
    "this leads to the dephasing of small oscillations @xcite .",
    "together with possible irreversible dissipation , the dephasing determines an apparent damping of the oscillations .",
    "the dephasing , caused by the nonlinearity effects , can lead to partial revivals under certain circumstances .",
    "examples of such revivals are the phonon ( see in @xcite ) , spin and photon echo effects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one has to distinguish between the classical stimulated revival ( echo ) caused by external perturbations applied to the oscillating system , and the quantum revival related to the discrete structure of the energy levels of the system which does not require any external disturbances @xcite .",
    "as will be shown below , these two revivals can have different time scales and therefore can be separated .    in this paper",
    ", we show that an analog of the phonon echo effect exists for the breathing modes of atomic oscillations in the optical lattices . however , the proposed echo mechanism possesses new features compared with the conventional phonon echo mechanism .",
    "first , the proposed mechanism is related to the oscillations of the dispersion of the atomic distribution as opposed to the average coordinate and momentum oscillations involved in the phonon echo model @xcite . in contrast with the conventional model of phonon echo @xcite , the excitation of the system in our model is achieved by means of the parametric modulation of the frequency of the atomic oscillations as opposed to applying a time - dependent external force to the atoms @xcite . as shown below",
    ", the suggested echo mechanism incorporates the features of both spin ( photon)@xcite and the phonon echo mechanisms due to the specific nature of the parametric excitation of the oscillations .",
    "this effect can be employed to study the revival and damping mechanisms of the breathing modes in optical lattices .",
    "an atom subjected to a off - resonant laser field experiences an energy shift of the ground state proportional to the intensity of the field . if the field is formed by a standing wave with large detuning , the effective potential for the atoms in the ground state is given by @xcite    @xmath2 ,    \\label{eq : opt.lattice}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 denotes the atomic center of mass coordinate , @xmath4 is the amplitude of the dipole potential ( proportional to the intensity of the laser field ) , and @xmath5 is the wave vector of the laser field . normally , the initial state of the system is formed by doppler cooling , so that the trapped atoms are in thermal equilibrium near the minima of the optical potential and form an optical lattice . in this paper",
    "we will consider the case of temperatures @xmath6 much larger than the energy of the atomic oscillations at the bottom of the potential .",
    "consequently , no quantum effects will be taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , the temperature should be low enough to insure that the atoms do not escape from the potential well . if the magnitude of the optical lattice potential is time - dependent , then    @xmath7 ,    \\label{eq : v}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 describes the parametric excitation of the lattice ( @xmath9=const ) .",
    "therefore , the effective potential can be approximated as an oscillator with weak anharmonicity and time - dependent frequency .",
    "the harmonic frequency corresponding to the potential ( [ eq : opt.lattice ] ) is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the atomic mass .",
    "we assume that the parametric excitation of the system occurs in the form of two short pulses    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 characterize the intensities and the instants when",
    "the pulses are applied to the optical lattice . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the equation of motion is given by    @xmath17    where we introduced the dimensionless variables    @xmath18    with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the physics of the echo effect in the optical lattice can be understood as follows .",
    "we assume that initially the atomic system is in thermal equilibrium characterized by the values of coordinate and momentum dispersions @xmath23 .",
    "the first pulse initiates the squeezing of the atomic phase space distribution creating the classical squeezed states @xcite . in harmonic systems , such squeezing results in oscillations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the non - linearity leads to dephasing and therefore to the apparent damping of these oscillations .",
    "since the dephasing is reversible in time , one expects to observe at least a partial revival of the oscillations after the application of the second pulse to the system .",
    "a qualitative physical picture of the phenomenon will be discussed in the next section . here",
    "we concentrate on the numerical results .    in order to study the echo effect",
    ", we performed a numerical simulation using the equation of motion ( [ eq : eq._of_motion1 ] ) with subsequent averaging of @xmath27 over the initial conditions @xmath28 , @xmath29 distributed in accordance with the initial thermal ensemble .",
    "the results for the normalized average dispersion @xmath30 are presented in fig.1 .",
    "one can see the expected damping of the squeezing oscillations after each pulse due to the dephasing effect .",
    "the characteristic damping rate is increasing with an increase of the temperature .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the time evolution of @xmath31 is the pronounced echo effect at @xmath32 .",
    "the revival time is approximately @xmath33 according to the general considerations involved in the two - pulse phonon and the spin echo models .",
    "note however , that the revival of @xmath31 is only partial ( approximately @xmath34 of the initial amplitude ) .    in fig.2",
    ", we present the dependence of the echo amplitude on the intensity of the second pulse .",
    "the echo amplitude is very small for small values of @xmath35 , then it increases sharply in the intermediate region of @xmath35 and saturates in the nonlinear regime .",
    "in order to clarify the mechanism of the proposed echo effect and compare with the other echo mechanisms , we consider the approximate analytical solution of eq.([eq : eq._of_motion1 ] ) valid for the low temperature ( small anharmonicity ) . in this case , it is sufficient to take into account only the first ( quartic ) correction to the effective harmonic potential .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eq._of_motion1 ] ) reduces to    @xmath36    where we neglected the modulation of the non - linear term assuming that the amplitudes of the pulses @xmath37 and @xmath35 are sufficiently small . for @xmath38 , the eq.([eq : eq._of_motion ] )",
    "has an integral of motion corresponding to the energy of the atomic system @xmath39 ( i.e. , there are 3 different values of energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 for times @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ) .    for small anharmonicity and amplitudes of the external pulses , the solution of the eq.([eq : eq._of_motion ] ) for @xmath45 up to the second order terms in @xmath40 can be obtained in the form    @xmath46 , \\\\ \\\\",
    "c_k = \\tilde{e}_k + \\frac{3}{4}\\tilde{e}_k^2 , \\label{eq : envelopek } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 . from eq.(7 ) , it follows that @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 corresponds to the phase of the atomic oscillations in different time intervals .",
    "note that @xmath50 are the complex constants characterizing both the amplitude and phase of the atomic oscillations and @xmath51 stands for the effective frequency .",
    "this frequency is determined in the limit @xmath52 as @xmath53 the solution given by eqs.([eq : envelopek ] ) and ( [ eq : omgeff ] ) corresponds to the first term of the asymptotic expansion for the anharmonic oscillator in the limit of weak anharmonicity and large evolution time @xcite .    each pulse in eq.([eq : eq._of_motion ] ) results in a jump of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while @xmath56 remains continuous .",
    "we obtain from eq.([eq : eq._of_motion ] )    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the moment of time just before and just after each pulse and @xmath61 . after the application of the first pulse , we obtain from eqs.([eq : envelopek ] ) and ( [ eq : jump ] ) for small @xmath37    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    combining eqs.([eq : a_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : omgeff ] ) , and averaging over the random initial phase and the thermally distributed initial energy in the limit of low temperatures ( @xmath64 ) , we obtain the time evolution of the coordinate dispersion in the form    @xmath65 ,   \\quad \\tau_p > \\tau > 0 , \\label{eq:1pulse}\\ ] ]    with the dephasing rate of oscillations defined by    @xmath66    eq.([eq:1pulse ] ) indicates that the amplitude of the oscillations of the coordinate dispersion exhibits an apparent damping . as discussed above , this damping is caused by the anharmonicity which results in the dependence of the effective oscillation frequency on energy , and the thermal energy distribution leading to an averaging out of the oscillations .",
    "therefore , this damping is reversible in time . the dephasing rate given by eq.([eq : deph.rate ] ) is in a good qualitative agreement with the numerical results discussed above .",
    "fitting the data presented in fig.1 for @xmath67 by eq.([eq:1pulse ] ) gives the value @xmath68 for the dephasing rate in our numerical simulations .",
    "now we will analyze the effect of the second pulse .",
    "applying eq.([eq : jump ] ) for @xmath69 and @xmath70 consecutively , one obtains the amplitude @xmath71 in eq.([eq : envelopek ] ) after the second pulse ( @xmath72)in the limit of small @xmath35    @xmath73    where @xmath74 correspond to the envelope solution for @xmath75 given by eq.([eq : envelopek ] ) .",
    "the @xmath76-vectors rotate with the frequencies @xmath77 in the complex plane .",
    "the energy after the second pulse is given by    @xmath78    with @xmath79 and @xmath80 defined by eqs.([eq : a_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e_1 ] ) .    in order to obtain a qualitative picture of the echo effect , we disregard the energy change due to both pulses upon the frequencies @xmath81 .",
    "eq.([eq:2ampl ] ) indicates that the amplitude @xmath82 after the second pulse is a linear combination of the amplitude before the pulse @xmath83 and the amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "note , that @xmath85 is proportional to the complex conjugate of @xmath86 .    in fig.3",
    ", we present the two vector amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 rotating with the frequencies @xmath89 in a complex plane . if the two vectors have the same phase @xmath90 at @xmath91 then the phase difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 is accumulated over the time interval @xmath92 .",
    "the phases of the complex conjugate vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 are inverted with respect to @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the vector @xmath97 was rotating faster than the vector @xmath98 and therefore @xmath99 is delayed with respect to @xmath100 . if the vectors continue rotating with the same frequencies @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the phase difference between the vectors @xmath95 and @xmath96 increases contributing to the dephasing effect .",
    "in contrast , the phase difference between @xmath93 and @xmath94 vanishes at the time @xmath103 giving rise to the echo analogous to the well known spin and photon echo effect @xcite , @xcite .",
    "taking into account eqs.([eq : envelopek])-([eq : jump ] ) , ( [ eq:2ampl ] ) one arrives at the echo contribution after thermal averaging in the lowest order with respect to @xmath37 , @xmath35 and @xmath104    @xmath105    one can see that the amplitude of the echo is maximal at the time @xmath106 .",
    "note that the echo amplitude given by eq.([eq : echo ] ) is proportional to the product @xmath107 in contrast to the dependence @xmath108 typical for the phonon echo mechanism ( for the small @xmath37 , @xmath35 ) as a response to the external resonant forces @xcite .",
    "however , the spin echo type mechanism described above also leads to the terms @xmath109 omitted from eq.([eq:2ampl ] ) .",
    "according to the conventional model , the phonon echo originates from the change of the rotation frequency of the @xmath76-vectors due to the external pulses .",
    "this mechanism is also present in our model if we take into account the change of the energy @xmath55 in each time interval . in this case",
    ", the main contribution comes from the second term on the r.h.s . of the eq.([eq:2ampl ] ) .",
    "however , this effect is proportional to @xmath110 and vanishes for small pulse intensities .",
    "analytical calculations in this case become rather cumbersome and we do not present them here . since we disregard the change of the rotating frequency due to the second pulse , the approximation leading to eq.([eq : echo ] ) is valid if @xmath111",
    ". this condition can only be satisfied in the limit @xmath112 for large evolution time ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the asymptotic nature of the proposed analytical solutions @xcite .",
    "note , that the echo effect analyzed above is a stimulated classical revival of breathing oscillations in contrast to the effect of quantum revival @xcite caused by the discrete nature of the energy levels in quantum systems .",
    "we estimated a characteristic time of the quantum revival @xmath114 ( or @xmath115 ) by extending the method of ref.@xcite to finite temperatures .",
    "the ratio @xmath116 is @xmath117 and therefore @xmath118 in the classical limit .",
    "since the classical echo mechanism described above takes place in the time domain @xmath32 , the quantum revival will not contribute to the effect if @xmath119 .",
    "for the value of @xmath120 used in our numerical simulations and assuming that the number of levels in the potential well ( [ eq : opt.lattice ] ) is @xmath121 , we obtain @xmath122 and @xmath123 . since @xmath124 , the above mentioned condition is satisfied .",
    "we investigated the dephasing and stimulated revival ( echo ) of the breathing oscillations in optical lattices subject to two - pulse parametric excitation created by the abrupt change of off - resonant dipole optical potential induced by the laser field .",
    "the dephasing originates from the energy dependent corrections to the oscillation frequency and due to the thermal distribution of energy .",
    "the shape of the echo response was obtained by numerical simulation using the equation of motion for the atoms with subsequent averaging over the initial thermal distribution .",
    "an approximate analytical analysis demonstrates that the suggested echo mechanism incorporates the essential physics features of spin(photon ) echo where echo effect is caused by the change of the phase of the oscillations due to the second pulse , as well as the phonon echo where the effect is caused by the change of the oscillation frequency .",
    "an optimal control analysis would be desirable ( e.g. as proposed for the spin systems@xcite ) for optimizing the echo response in view of the rapid development of novel experimental techniques ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite)for the coherent manipulation of the atomic motion in optical lattices .",
