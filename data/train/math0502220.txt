    "the original parking problem of knuth can be stated as follows . consider a parking lot with @xmath0 spaces , identified with the cyclic group @xmath1 .",
    "initially the parking lot is empty , and @xmath2 cars in a queue arrive one by one .",
    "car @xmath3 tries to park on a uniformly distributed space @xmath4 among the @xmath0 possible , independently of other cars , but if the space is already occupied , then it tries places labeled @xmath5 until it finally finds a free spot to park .",
    "as cars arrive , blocks of consecutive occupied spots are forming .",
    "it appears that a _ phase transition _ occurs at the stage where the parking lot is almost full , more precisely when the number of free spots is of order @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , while the largest block of occupied spots is of order @xmath7 with high probability as long as @xmath8 , a block of size approximately @xmath0 is present ( while the others are of order at most @xmath9 ) with high probability when @xmath10 . in the meanwhile",
    ", precisely when @xmath11 is of order @xmath12 with @xmath13 , a clustering phenomenon occurs as @xmath14 decays .",
    "the behavior of this clustering process has been studied precisely by chassaing and louchard @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the process of the relative sizes of occupied blocks is related to the so - called _ standard additive coalescent _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model originates from a problem in computer science : spaces in the parking lot should be thought of as elementary memory spaces , each of which can be used to store elementary data ( cars ) .",
    "roughly , our aim in this work is to investigate the more general situation where one wants to store larger files , each requiring several elementary memory spaces . in other words ,",
    "single cars are replaced by _",
    "caravans _ of cars , i.e. several cars may arrive simultaneously at the same spot . in this direction , it will be convenient to consider a continuous version of the problem , that goes as follows .",

    "a drop of paint falls , we brush it clockwise in such a way that the resulting painted portion of @xmath22 is covered by a unit density of paint .",
    "so at each step the drop of paint is used to cover a new portion of the circle and the total length of the painted part of the circle when @xmath23 drops have fallen is @xmath24 . in this",
    "setting , drops of paint play the role of caravans , and the painted portion of the circle corresponds to occupied spots in the parking lot .    more precisely , we consider an increasing sequence @xmath25 of open subsets of @xmath26 , starting from @xmath27 and ending at @xmath28 , which can be thought of as the successive painted portions of the circle . given @xmath29 and the location @xmath30 from where the @xmath31-th drop of paint will be brushed , we paint as many space as possible to the right of @xmath30 with the quantity @xmath32 of paint , without covering the already painted parts , i.e.  the blocks of @xmath29 .",
    "alternatively , we break the @xmath31-th caravan into several pieces , so that to fill as much as possible the holes left by @xmath33 after @xmath30 , when reading in clockwise order .",
    "the last car to park arrives at some location @xmath34 , and we let @xmath35 be the union of @xmath29 and the arc between @xmath30 and @xmath34 , see figure [ fig : park ] .",

    "following chassaing and louchard @xcite , we are interested in the formation of macroscopic painted components in the limit when @xmath61 tends to @xmath62 , at times close to @xmath63 , i.e. when the circle is almost entirely painted .",

    "this is what we shall do in theorem 1 , using the exponential time change @xmath70 .    before describing our main result ,",
    "let us first recall some features of the additive coalescent .",
    "the additive coalescent @xmath71 is a markov process with values in the infinite ordered simplex @xmath72 endowed with the uniform distance , whose evolution is described formally by : given that the current state is @xmath73 , two terms @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , of @xmath73 are chosen and merge into a single term @xmath77 ( which implies some reordering of the resulting sequence ) at a rate equal to @xmath77 .",

    "as shown in @xcite , eternal additive coalescents can be encoded by certain bridges .",
    "specifically , let @xmath79 be a cdlg real - valued process with exchangeable increments , such that @xmath80 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath81 has infinite variation and no negative jumps a.s .",
    "then @xmath81 attains its overall infimum at a unique location @xmath82 ( which is uniformly distributed on @xmath83 $ ] ) , and @xmath81 is continuous at @xmath82 .",
    "consider the so - called _ vervaat transform _ which maps the bridge @xmath81 into an excursion @xmath84 defined by @xmath85 where the addition @xmath86 is modulo @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we let for @xmath87 @xmath88 and introduce @xmath89 as the random element of @xmath90 defined by the ranked sequence of the lengths of the constancy intervals of the process @xmath91 . here , a constancy interval means a connected component of the complement of the support of the stieltjes measure @xmath92 .",
    "finally , if we define @xmath93 , then @xmath94 is an eternal additive coalescent ( see section [ subsec : extreme ] for comments and details ) .    in this work ,",
    "eternal additive coalescent associated to certain remarkable bridges will play a key role .",
    "more precisely , we write @xmath95 for the eternal additive coalescent @xmath71 constructed above when @xmath96 is a standard brownian bridge ; so that @xmath97 is the so - called standard additive coalescent ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . next ,",

    "_ a _ loop _ and not a _ bridge _ to avoid a possible confusion : even though @xmath102 starts from @xmath62 , ends at @xmath62 and has exchangeable increments , it does not have the same law as the stable process @xmath100 conditioned on @xmath103 ! ] of index @xmath49 the process @xmath102 defined by @xmath104 we finally write @xmath105 for the eternal additive coalescent @xmath71 constructed above when the bridge @xmath81 is the standard stable loop of index @xmath49 .",

    "[ convaddcoal ] the process @xmath106 converges as @xmath107 in the sense of weak convergence of finite - dimensional distributions to some process @xmath108 . the exponential time - changed process @xmath109 is an eternal additive coalescent ; more precisely :    \\(i ) when @xmath110 , @xmath109 is distributed as @xmath111    \\(ii ) when @xmath112 , @xmath109 is distributed as @xmath113    it might be interesting to discuss further the role of the parameter @xmath49 and the interpretation in terms of phase transition .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the renewal theorem entails than the number of drops of paint needed for the complete covering is @xmath114 , a quantity which is not sensitive to @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to show that for every @xmath115 , there are no macroscopic painted components when only @xmath116 $ ] drops of paint have fallen , so the phase transition ( i.e. the number of drops which is needed for the appearance of macroscopic components ) occurs for numbers close to @xmath117 .",
    "more precisely , the regime for the phase transition is of order @xmath118 ; so the phase transition occurs closer to @xmath117 when @xmath49 is larger .",
    "we would like also to stress that one - dimensional distributions of the limiting additive coalescent process @xmath119 depend on @xmath49 , but not its semigroup which is the same for all @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "a heuristic explanation might be the following : the number of drops needed to complete the covering once the phase transition has occurred is too small ( of order @xmath120 ) to observe significant differences in the dynamics of aggregation of macroscopic painted components .",
    "* remark . *",
    "our model bears some similarity with another parking problem on the circle , where drops of paints fall uniformly on the circle and then are brushed clockwise , but where overlaps are now allowed ( some points may be covered this way several times ) , call it the `` random covering of an interval '' problem .",
    "however , as showed in @xcite , this last model has very different asymptotics from those of the parking problem , as it turns out that the random covering of an interval is related to kingman s coalescent rather than the additive coalescent .",
    "a shared feature is that the phase transition of the random covering problem appears also when the circle is almost completely covered , but for example the different fragments are ultimately finite in number rather than infinite .",
    "we also mention yet another parking problem , first considered by rnyi ( see @xcite ) . in",
    "can be formulated as follows : caravans with size @xmath61 are placed on @xmath26 ( the original work rather considers @xmath121 ) one after another , but the locations @xmath74 where cars park are chosen uniformly among spaces that do not induce overlaps and splitting of caravans , i.e.  so that the length of the arc from @xmath74 to @xmath122 is exactly @xmath61 .",
    "this is done until no uncovered sub - arc of @xmath26 with size @xmath123 remains .",
    "this process does not involve coalescing blocks of cars , and one is rather interested in the properties of the random number of cars that are able to park .",
    "the method in @xcite relies on an encoding _ parking _ function which is shown to be asymptotically related to a function of standard brownian bridge , and a representation of the standard additive coalescent due to bertoin @xcite .",
    "our approach to theorem [ convaddcoal ] is close in spirit to that of @xcite , and uses the representation of eternal additive coalescent that we presented above ; we briefly sketch it here .",
    "first , we encode the process @xmath124 by a bridge with exchangeable increments in sect .",
    "[ sec : bridge ] . in sect.[sec : conv ] , we show that this bridge converges to some bridge with exchangeable increments that can be represented in terms of the standard brownian bridge ( for @xmath110 ) or the standard stable loop ( for @xmath112 ) .",
    "theorem [ convaddcoal ] then follows readily .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : bridge ] we provide a representation of the painted components in terms of a bridge and its vervaat s transform .",
    "the convergence of these bridges when @xmath61 tends to @xmath62 is established in section [ sec : conv ] , and that of the sequence of the sizes of the painted components in section [ convxeps ] .",
    "section [ sec : discrete ] is devoted to a brief discussion of the analogous discrete setting ( i.e. knuth s parking for caravans ) , and finally some complements are presented in section [ sec : compl ] .",
    "we develop a representation of the parking process with the help of bridges with exchangeable increments , which is crucial to our study .",
    "let us first give the proper definition the of sequence @xmath125 of the introduction .",
    "we identify the circle @xmath22 with @xmath52 and write @xmath126 for the canonical projection .",
