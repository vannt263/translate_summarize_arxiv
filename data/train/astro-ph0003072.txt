    "there are numerous scientific projects which would benefit from large area infrared surveys .",
    "most fit into the category of discovering and characterising new objects .",
    "an example is a survey for very low mass stars , brown dwarfs and free floating giant planets in open clusters and star forming regions .",
    "all of these objects are cool ( @xmath2 ) and have a significantly larger j than r or i band flux .",
    "they can thus be detected with their optical  infrared colour , or even their z  j colours obtainable on the same hgcdte detector .",
    "other areas of science which would benefit from surveys include : the initial mass function of star forming regions ; the dark matter content and the age of the galaxy from cool white dwarfs in the galactic disk and halo ; galactic structure traced via k and m giants ( which , due to the lower extinction in the near infrared , can be traced to larger distances ) ; galaxy surveys at low galactic latitudes ; quasar surveys ; star formation history and damped lyman alpha galaxies ; high redshift galaxies ; gravitational lenses and the cosmological constant .",
    "to serve these scientific goals , we plan to build a wide field near infrared ( 0.82.5 ) imaging camera for doing large area surveys . given the nature of the calar alto observatory as a resource for german and spanish astronomers , this camera ( omega 2000 ) is intended for use in common - user mode rather than undertaking pre - defined surveys .",
    "some projects are less concerned with area coverage than with volume , in which case deep ` pencil - beam ' surveys are more suitable",
    ". this may be the appropriate strategy when searching for objects at a range of distances , and in some cases may be more efficient than shallower wide field surveys @xcite .",
    "a list of current and future near infrared survey facilities is given in table  [ wfnircams ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is as follows . after giving the important characteristics of the detector , we discuss the general issues influencing the design of the instrument .",
    "much attention is paid to baffling schemes to minimise thermal radiation from the telescope structures . the chosen optical design for omega 2000",
    "is then presented , a long with a brief discussion of the electronic and software systems and readout modes required for this high data rate instrument .",
    ".a selection of current and future near infrared instruments .",
    "all use hgcdte arrays except nirc and niri which use insb arrays ( sensitive over 15 ) .",
    "` speed ' is the product of field size ( in sq .  degrees ) and aperture ( in m@xmath3 , neglecting the hole in the primary mirror ) and is some measure of how rapidly a survey area can be covered to a certain depth .",
    "it is at best a rough estimate as it neglects instrument sensitivity and throughput and site conditions .",
    "some instruments have different cameras ( and hence pixel scales ) : the largest is shown .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , > , > , > , < \" , ]      the mpias generic infrared camera software ( geirs )  @xcite will also be used for omega 2000 .",
    "the new challenge is the 26 times higher data rate compared to the 1k@xmath01k hawaii detector on existing instruments .",
    "the data acquisition software must be able to sustain this data rate continuously , apply necessary preprocessing tasks , have data visualization control and save the data in time to non - volatile storage disks .",
    "the data are acquired by either one or two 30 mhz 16bit parallel interfaces .",
    "the handling of the increased data rate can only be organised in a current state of the art symmetrical multiprocessor system ( e.g.  a sparc ultraserver 450 ) , where nearly the full memory bandwidth is consumed for the basic tasks needed to control the camera system and human interfacing .",
    "the software package is already optimised for minimal usage of memory by sharing data memory between all processes . to keep the jobs synchronised without loss of efficiency , further parallelization making optimal use of the multiprocessing capabilities has to be implemented .",
    "the granularity of the shared memory buffers for the parallel processing also has to be reorganised to make more efficient use of the increased internal working memory .",
    "although this can be done with standard computer architecture , there remains the option of using distributed processing on standard hardware with distributed memory ( the so - called `` multiple instructions on multiple data '' organization ) .",
