    "arguably the two most important open questions about the formation of early  type galaxies are when they formed their first stars and when they assembled dynamically . while the latter question is probably best answered by observations at intermediate and high redshift , the answer to the former is likely to be found from observations in the more local universe .",
    "a number of studies have estimated the epoch of star formation by comparison of observations of the diffuse stellar component in nearby and low - redshift galaxies to stellar population models ( e.g.  renzini 1999 and bender 1997 for reviews ) . however , the use of diffuse star light has two main disadvantages .",
    "first , it is very difficult to disentangle different stellar populations and , second , a relatively recent but ( in mass ) unimportant star formation episode can dominate the luminosity  weighted quantities used to derive the star formation history .",
    "both these problems are by  passed when globular clusters are used to study the main epochs of star formation . in nearby galaxies ,",
    "individual globular clusters appear as point source , and can be characterized by a single age and a single metallicity .",
    "distinct populations can easily be identified ( e.g.  in a color distribution of the globular cluster system ) and the mean properties of the sub  populations can be determined .",
    "the relative numbers in each sub  population will also indicate the relative importance of each star formation episode .",
    "there is strong support for the assumption that globular cluster formation traces star formation .",
    "first , major star formation observed today in interacting galaxies is accompanied by the formation of massive young star clusters ( e.g.  schweizer 1997 , although their exact nature is still under debate , brodie et al .",
    "second , the specific frequency ( i.e.  number of globular clusters normalized to the galaxy star light , see harris & van den bergh 1981 ) is constant to within a factor of two in almost all galaxies ( see compilation in ashman & zepf 1998 ) , which points to a link between star and cluster formation . moreover",
    ", although this relation seems to fail in giant ellipticals , mclaughlin ( 1999 ) has shown that the number of globular clusters is in fact proportional to the total mass , and the number per unit mass is extremely constant from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "finally , in less violent star formation episodes , larsen & richtler ( 1999 ) have shown that the number of young star clusters in spirals is directly proportional to the current star formation rate .",
    "to first order , globular clusters are likely to be excellent tracers for the star formation episodes in early  type galaxies .",
    "there is now evidence for multiple globular cluster sub  populations in a number of luminous , early  type galaxies ( zepf & ashman 1993 , ashman & zepf 1998 for a recent compilation ) .",
    "the origin of these sub ",
    "populations is still under debate ( e.g.  gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ) but it seems clear that the main sub ",
    "populations formed in different star  formation episodes , perhaps at different epochs . in the best studied galaxies with multiple populations ,",
    "the number of clusters in each sub  population is roughly equal , suggesting that these galaxies have had more than one _ major _ star  formation episode . the overall evidence from photometry and more recently from spectroscopy ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998a , cohen et al .  1998 ) suggests that in the cluster giant ellipticals the main sub ",
    "populations are old . in other non  interacting early  type galaxies , the non  detection of sub  populations , either due to their absence or to a conspiracy of age and metallicity , leads to the same conclusion : no major globular cluster ( i.e.  star ) formation has occurred since @xmath2 ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "there have been a few previous attempts to determine the relative age difference between globular cluster sub  populations . in the s0 galaxy ngc  1380 , kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derived an age difference of around 3 to 4 gyr between the halo and bulge globular clusters . in m  87 ,",
    "kundu et al .  ( 1999 ) estimated the metal ",
    "rich clusters to be 3 to 6 gyr younger than the metal  poor ones . as a comparison , in the milky way",
    ", the difference between halo and bulge / disk globular clusters seems to be small ( less than 1 gyr : ortolani et al .",
    "1995 , around 17% : rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "deriving relative ages from photometry alone is complicated by the fact that broad band colors suffer from an age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy ( e.g.  worthey 1994 ) .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to measure several quantities that are affected differently by age and metallicity and to combine the results .",
    "for example , most broad band colors are more affected by metallicity than by age . on the other hand , optical magnitudes for a given mass",
    "are more affected by age than they are by metallicity .",
    "a combination of both can break the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy , when the mass distributions are known ( see sect .  [ models ] ) .",
    "both a mean color as well as a `` mean magnitude '' can be measured for a globular cluster sub  population .",
    "the mean color is simply the mean color of the globular cluster sub  sample , and",
    "can be determined from a color distribution of the globular clusters . the turn  over ( to ) point of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) of a given sub ",
    "population can be used as its `` mean magnitude '' . the absolute to magnitude of the gclf",
    "has been found to be fairly constant from one globular cluster system to the next in a wide variety of galaxy types and environments with a peak at @xmath3 ( see whitmore 1997 and ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 for summaries ) .",
    "three quantities affect the to value : age , metallicity and mass .",
    "the effects of age and metallicity on the magnitude of a single stellar population were quantified by ashman , conti & zepf ( 1995 ) using population synthesis models from bruzual & charlot ( 1995 ) .",
    "the mean mass influences the to magnitude because the to of the gclf corresponds to a break in the globular cluster mass distribution ( e.g.  mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ) .",
    "that is , if the characteristic mass ( at which the slope of the power law mass function changes ) varies , the to magnitude will be affected .",
    "however , the mass distributions seem to be extremely similar from galaxy to galaxy and are expected to be very similar for different sub  populations within the same galaxy if destruction processes are the dominant mechanism for shaping the mass distribution , and had time enough to act on both sub  populations .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ discussion ] .    neither the mean color nor the to magnitude alone can be used to derive the age and metallicity of a globular cluster population because of the above  mentioned degeneracy .",
    "this paper marks the first time that both the mean color _ and _ the to magnitude of each globular cluster sub  population have been simultaneously compared to single stellar population ( ssp ) models ( see sect .  [ models ] ) in order to distinguish age and metallicity .",
    "deep high  quality photometry is required to reliably determine the mean color and the to magnitude ( implying good photometry below this to point ) and clean globular cluster samples are needed , i.e.  good discrimination between globular clusters and fore/background contamination is essential . the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on  board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) provides the most accurate photometric data available and makes such an analysis feasible .",
    "for this first study , we selected a galaxy that hosts a populous globular cluster system which provides good number statistics even after the sample is split into the different sub  populations .",
    "ngc  4472 ( m  49 ) , the brightest giant elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster , is located in the center of a sub  group within the cluster and is of hubble type e2 . it is one of the brightest early  type galaxy within 20 mpc with an absolute magnitude of @xmath4 ( see table 1 for other characteristics ) .",
    "it hosts @xmath5 globular clusters ( geisler et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the specific frequency of globular clusters is @xmath6 , close to the average for bright cluster ellipticals .",
    "previous photometric studies of the globular cluster system of this galaxy include those of cohen ( gunn  thuan photometry , 1988 ) , couture et al .",
    "( johnson photometry , 1991 ) , ajhar et al .",
    "( johnson photometry , 1994 ) , and geisler et al .  ( 1996 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 1998 , both washington photometry ) .",
    "the two most recent studies were the first to obtain a comprehensive enough data set to allow the identification and characterization of the two main globular cluster sub  populations .",
    "the mean metallicities of the two sub  populations were found to be [ fe / h]@xmath7 and @xmath8 dex for the blue and red peak , respectively .",
    "the observed metallicity gradient ( @xmath9[fe / h]/@xmath9 log@xmath10 dex / log(arcsec ) ) in the system is mostly due to the radially varying ratio of these two populations .",
    "the metal  rich component is spatially more concentrated and has the same ellipticity as the galaxy star light while the metal  poor component is more extended and spherical .",
    "these two components can be loosely associated with the `` halo '' and `` bulge '' of ngc  4472 suggesting different formation mechanisms for these galaxy structures and the associated clusters .",
    "the relative ages of these two components is the subject of this paper .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ observation ] we present the observation and data reduction . section [ analysis ] contains details of the data analysis ; color and turn  over magnitude determinations , etc .",
    "section [ agediffs ] compares the results to stellar evolutionary models to determine the age difference between the sub - populations . in section",
    "[ distance ] we derive a new distance to ngc  4472 using the to magnitude method .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes the results .",
    "the wfpc2 images of ngc  4472 were obtained from two data sets .",
    "the nuclear pointing was taken from westphal et al .",
    "( from hst program go.5236 ) and was complemented by our own pointings to the north and south of the galaxy ( hst program go.5920 , pi : brodie ) which were offset in dec by 2  16  and 2  49  from the center of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "the data are summarized in tab .  2 .",
    "we used calibrated science images returned by the stsci .",
    "the basic reduction was carried out in iraf .",
    "the images were combined with the task crrej of the stsdas package .",
    "the brodie data set consists of paired , dithered exposures , and was thus registered by shifting the second of each image pair by 0.506  ( i.e.  5 pixels for the wf chips , 12 pixels for the pc chips ) with the task imshift .    using the standard aperture radius of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) of 0.5 , we tested for any magnitude error that might be introduced by incomplete shifting of frames .",
    "this error was found to be less than 0.0003 mag for both filters and is therefore negligible .",
    "the photometry was carried out using the source extraction software sextractor v2.0.19 by bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) .",
    "for the purpose of object selection only , the images were convolved with the instrumental psf to improve the detection efficiency .",
    "the psf for each filter was taken from the hst handbook version 4.0 , using the psfs ( pixel centered ) at 600 nm for f555w and at 800 nm for f814w .",
    "the selection criteria were set to 2 connected pixels , 2@xmath11 above the background computed in a @xmath12 pix@xmath13 grid .",
    "magnitudes were measured in 2 pixels and 0.5  radius apertures ( see also next section ) .",
    "objects in common on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 frames were identified and matched .",
    "the positions on the sky of all objects were computed using the task metric in the stsdas package .",
    "the calibration and transformation to the johnson  cousins @xmath14 and @xmath15 filters followed holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and corrections for charge transfer efficiency and gain ( @xmath16 for all our data ) were applied . in",
    "what follows , the magnitude errors will _ not _ include the @xmath17 systematic error potentially introduced by the calibration .",
    "the values measured in the 0.5  radius apertures were used to compute the final magnitudes in order to avoid having to apply an additional correction to the data .",
    "globular clusters at the distance of the virgo galaxy cluster are expected to be resolved . milky way globular clusters have typical half  light radii between 3 and 10 pc ( e.g.  harris 1996 ) , corresponding to 0.04  to 0.13  at 16 mpc distance .",
    "indeed , most of our globular cluster candidates have fwhm measurements ( as returned by sextractor ) slightly larger than measured for unresolved objects .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the photometric corrections proposed by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for unresolved objects will not be valid for converting from the 0.5  radius aperture to the total globular cluster magnitude .",
    "new rough corrections were derived as follows .",
    "we computed @xmath18 pix@xmath13 normally sampled psfs in @xmath14 and @xmath15 for a wf chip using the tiny tim v4.4 program by krist & hook ( 1997 ) , and convolved these psfs with hubble laws of different core radii ( 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.6 ) . note that these psfs include the convolution with the diffusion kernel ( cf .",
    "krist & hook 1997 ) which is not well defined .",
    "this kernel introduces an intrinsic smoothing to the optical psf ( as seen at the top of the ccd chip ) due to charge diffusion .",
    "the cumulative light distributions of these modeled objects were compared with those of a set of isolated globular cluster candidates of various luminosities and chip positions taken from our data .",
    "the data in @xmath15 match almost perfectly the psf convolved with a hubble law of 0.1  core ( corresponding to @xmath19 pc at a distance of 16 mpc ) , while the @xmath14 data lie in between the psf models convolved with 0.05  and 0.1  hubble laws .    the same procedure , using 10 times over  sampled psfs without applying any diffusion kernel , yielded best fitting hubble",
    " core radii of 0.3  for @xmath15 data and 0.1  for the @xmath14 data .",
    "until the behavior of the diffusion kernel is better understood ( wavelength dependencies , etc . ) , it is possible that a systematic core  radius error of about 0.1  ( @xmath19 pc ) may be present in all radius estimation studies of virgo globular clusters using wfpc2 data .",
    "nonetheless , we used the normally  sampled and diffusion  kernel convolved psfs for our analysis .",
    "the modeled light profiles ( see fig .  [",
    "ps : wachstum ] ) , unlike the real data , provide high enough signal  to  noise to determine the extrapolation from an 0.5  radius to the total @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "the derived corrections are applied to the 0.5   radius aperture measurements in addition to the holtzman point source correction of @xmath20 .",
    "these additional corrections are @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( which results in a color correction of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the errors reflect the uncertainty in matching the data with the models and the accuracy of the extrapolation to infinity of our fit to the light profile .",
    "the errors do not include , for example , the fact that the core and the half  light radii of different globular clusters may vary significantly . in general , our data were calibrated applying the correction for point sources of @xmath24 .",
    "when additional corrections were included , they are specifically mentioned in the text .",
    "note that the corrections are systematic , i.e.  they do not affect _ relative _ magnitudes .",
    "therefore , the accuracy with which we are able to determine age  metallicity _",
    "differences _ should not be seriously affected .",
    "artificial star / cluster experiments were carried out using the tasks starlist and mkobjects from the iraf package , artdata .",
    "1000 objects were added per run in both the @xmath14 and @xmath15 images .",
    "400 runs were computed resulting in 400,000 artificial objects per filter and covering the whole parameter space of background values . both objects modeled by a wf chip psf and objects modeled by the same psf but convolved with hubble laws of core radius 0.05  ( @xmath14 ) and 0.1  ( @xmath15 ) were added .",
    "all objects had a color of @xmath25 , previous tests with 5000 objects having shown no significant variations among the completeness curves for @xmath26  0.9 , 1.1 and 1.3 .    the selection completeness was computed for objects found on both the @xmath14 and @xmath15 images .",
    "all detected objects which passed our selection criteria ( see sect .",
    "[ selection ] ) and all input objects were sorted by their background value and subdivided in 10 background ",
    "value bins for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . a _ skewed fermi function _",
    "@xmath27 was fit to all completeness histograms for each background bin .",
    "a smoothing procedure using a low  pass filter gives nearly the same results .",
    "the 50% completeness limits lie around @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the lowest background value .",
    "the 50% completeness magnitude falls off continuously with a growing background ( see fig .  [",
    "ps : inc ] ) .",
    "the artificial  object experiments also allowed us to determine the error in the photometry and to test the accuracy with which the fwhm of objects can be recovered as a function of magnitude .",
    "typical fwhm values were deduced for extended objects which are a good match to the fwhm values of our globular cluster candidates .",
    "object selection criteria were applied to our extracted data to provide a clean sample of globular cluster candidates for further analysis .",
    "only objects which met the color cut of @xmath30 and a magnitude cut of @xmath31 25.5 and @xmath32 25.2 were included so that some of the red unresolved galaxy nuclei were rejected ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ ps : back ] ) .",
    "in addition , a fwhm cut in the range 0.75 pix @xmath33 fwhm @xmath33 2.5 pix was applied .",
    "we also calculated the magnitude difference obtained through apertures of 0.5 pix and 3 pix radii which allowed us to distinguish between point ",
    "source objects and extended objects like globular clusters ( e.g.  schweizer et al .",
    "1996 ) . a very rough upper cut of @xmath34 was used .",
    "the neural network of sextractor v2.0.19 , i.e.  the @xmath35 parameter was used to supplement the above selection criteria .",
    "this parameter was defined for well  sampled images ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "since the wfpc2 provides under  sampled images the reliability of the @xmath35 parameter is reduced .",
    "we applied only the selection criterion , @xmath36 , to our data .",
    "a test showed that for objects brighter than the 50% completeness level the @xmath35 parameter cut reliably eliminates point sources and cosmic rays .",
    "our final list of globular cluster candidates includes 705 objects in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is 38% of the initially extracted sample .",
    "an electronic list of the globular ",
    "cluster candidates is available from the authors .",
    "one significant advantage of hst data over ground ",
    "based observations is high spatial resolution which allows high  confidence rejection of extended objects .",
    "however , background contamination is still expected . in order to determine the background fraction in our data we ran the same extraction and selection criteria for the hubble deep field north ( hdf  n",
    ", williams et al .",
    "1996 ) images . since the hdf ",
    "n has galactic coordinates of @xmath37 125.89 and @xmath38 + 54.83 while our exposures have @xmath37 286.92 and @xmath38 + 70.20 , we might overestimate the contamination due to foreground stars using this approach , although foreground star contamination is , in any case , expected to be negligible .",
    "we obtained from the hst archive images in f606w and in the f814w filter with exposure times of 20200 sec for f814w and 15200 sec for f606w , respectively .",
    "these images are far deeper than our own .",
    "both magnitudes for f606w and f814w were transformed to johnson @xmath14 and cousins @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "we determined contamination histograms with and without the application of our selection criteria in order to establish their reliability .",
    "exponential laws have been fit to the histograms , after applying the rejection criteria , up to the 50% completeness limits .",
    "the exponential laws act as input for our improved maximum  likelihood code ( see sect .  [ tomags ] ) .",
    "note the efficiency of our selection criteria .",
    "nearly all background objects are removed from the data up to the 50% completeness magnitude .",
    "the contamination is less than 5% for both the @xmath39 and @xmath40 filters ( see fig .",
    "[ ps : back ] ) .",
    "we stress again that all the above corrections were applied to the full sample , i.e.  differential values between sub  samples remain unaffected even if small systematic effects have been introduced .",
    "our goal is to determine the mean colors and turn  over magnitudes of the luminosity functions of the two main globular cluster sub  populations in both the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 filters .",
    "these colors and magnitudes can then be compared to the predictions of population synthesis models for given ages and metallicities .      in order to determine the mean colors of the sub ",
    "populations we selected from the total sample objects with small photometric errors .",
    "the application of a magnitude cut at @xmath41 resulted in errors @xmath42 .",
    "we further applied an upper magnitude cut at @xmath43 ( corresponding to @xmath44 at the distance of virgo ) in order to exclude any foreground star contamination , and a broad cut in color ( @xmath45 ) to isolate the region where globular clusters are expected .",
    "the color  magnitude diagram of our sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ ps : fhd ] , together with the box ( dotted lines ) of pre  selected objects ( see sect .  [ selection ] ) .",
    "a @xmath46 histogram of those selected objects is shown in fig .",
    "[ ps : color ] .",
    "formally , a key underlying assumption is that the color ( metallicity ) does not significantly vary with magnitude ( mass ) within a sub  population .",
    "this appears to be the case as far as can be tested with our data .    a kmm test ( ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) was run on our constrained sub  sample .",
    "the test determines the confidence with which bimodality can be said to be present , the most likely relative contribution of each population to the sample , and the peaks ( i.e.  mean colors ) of each sub  population .",
    "we find that the color distribution is bimodal at the @xmath47% confidence level .",
    "the relative contributions of objects to the selected sample ( cf .  sect .",
    "[ selection ] ) are 282 and 423 in the blue and red populations respectively",
    ". the peaks of the color distribution lie at @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the blue and red sub  populations , respectively .",
    "formally , the peaks can be determined with an accuracy of 0.005 mag .",
    "the error adopted here reflects the range of values derived by varying the selection criteria ( i.e.  magnitude and color cuts ) .",
    "two fitting modes were used : 1 ) forcing identical dispersions ( homoscedastic fit ) , 2 ) allowing independent dispersions ( heteroscedastic fit ) .",
    "we note that substantially better fits , in terms of reduced @xmath50 , are obtained if the dispersions of the blue and red distributions are allowed to differ , and that the red population seems to have a color distribution twice as broad as the blue one ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "we estimated the peak colors with yet another method that avoids the assumption of a gaussian distribution for each color peak ( intrinsic to the kmm code ) .",
    "we computed the density distribution in color of the objects with the help of a kernel estimator using the epanechnikov kernel ( e.g.  gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ) .",
    "we used @xmath53 for the smoothing parameter ( see silverman 1986 for detailed discussion ) , an average of the optimal smoothing parameters for the blue and red peak ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) estimated from the @xmath11guess of kmm for both modes .",

    "note that the _ relative _ color difference , later used to derive the age difference , is only affected by these corrections in second order .",
    "the final , corrected mean colors of the two populations are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the to magnitudes of the luminosity functions for the blue and red sub  population were individually determined in each filter using a maximum likelihood approach ( cf .",
    "secker 1992 ) .",
    "the changing background counts over our whole sample motivated us to develop a version of secker s ( 1992 ) maximum likelihood estimator which includes background variations .",
    "we calculated the completeness as a function of magnitude and background noise as described in sect .",
    "[ artstar ] .",
    "this improved code , described below , was used to derive the peak of the magnitude distribution for each filter and each sub  population .",
    "secker ( 1992 ) showed that the gclf of the milky way and m31 was best represented analytically with the student s @xmath63-function @xmath64 we adopted the student s @xmath63function as the most appropriate distribution for the gclf of ngc  4472 since it matches the tails of the distribution better than a gaussian function .",

    "we confirm geisler et al.s ( 1996 ) result , that this gradient is caused by the changing ratio of red to blue clusters as a function of radius , rather than an overall decrease in metallicity with radius .",

    "interestingly , in both ngc  3115 ( kundu & whitmore 1998 ) and m  87 ( kundu et al .",
    "1999 ) , the blue clusters also appear significantly larger than the red ones .",
    "the authors suggest this is due to different radial distributions for the red and blue clusters , noting that galactic globular clusters with larger galactocentric distances have larger half  light radii ( van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "to study the radial dependence of globular cluster size , we plotted the size parameter ( @xmath146 ) versus radius and found no gradients : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the radius in arcsec , and @xmath151 , for the blue and red clusters respectively ( see also fig .",
    "[ ps : sizerad ] ) .",
    "the difference between blue and red clusters is present at all radii .",
    "we therefore speculate that the different sizes are a relic of the different formation processes , unless the red and blue clusters are on significantly different orbits .",
    "for example , the red clusters could be preferentially on radial orbits and be systematically more affected than the blue clusters by the central potential during their close passage near the galaxy center .",
    "we compare our results ( to magnitude and mean color ) to various population synthesis models in order to derive the age _ difference _ between the blue and red globular cluster sub  populations .",
    "we used the new models from maraston ( 1998 ) as well as the most recent models from the gttingen group ( kurth et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the models from bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) and worthey ( 1994 ) . in each case",
    "we compared our data to every available initial mass function ( imf ) , i.e.  usually the salpeter imf and a multi ",
    "slope imf .",
    "the full range of metallicities was used as well as the necessary age range .",
    "since we are only interested in age _ differences _ the exact normalization of the absolute magnitude , which is dependent on mass and mass  to  light ( m / l ) ratio for a given imf , is not important . the grids in fig .",
    "[ ps : mar ] to [ ps : wo ] can , therefore , be somewhat arbitrarily shifted in the y  direction . in the following , we fixed the grids in the y  direction such that the oldest sub  population lies on the oldest computed isochrone ( 15 gyr or 16 gyr ) .",
    "further , we arbitrarily set the blue population to @xmath152 and @xmath153 in order to compare the different models directly .",
    "there is no freedom in the x  direction since the color is not mass  dependent , and the grid is fixed in @xmath98 for a given stellar population .    for the mean colors of the blue and red sub  populations we used the colors derived in section [ meancol ] .",
    "the to values used were the ones derived for the full sample ( see table [ tab : magcol ] ) .",
    "we stress again that additive corrections to both the blue and red to magnitudes ( i.e.  reddening correction , potential systematic errors , aperture corrections ) only influence the difference as second order effects , if at all , and are not a concern .",
    "however , we make two important underlying assumptions .",
    "we assume that the m / l ratios for blue and red clusters are only dependent on age and metallicity ( i.e.  the imfs of the blue and red clusters are similar ) .",
    "second , we assume that blue and red cluster populations have the same underlying mass distribution ( by which we mean globular cluster masses , not imfs ) . under these assumptions , to magnitudes are influenced only by age and metallicity .",
    "we briefly discuss the validity of these assumptions and the errors they potentially introduce .",
    "kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1998b ) review the empirical reasons for expecting the mass distributions and m / l ratios to be similar among various sub  populations .",
    "briefly , the m / l assumption is essentially the assumption that both blue and red clusters have similar imfs , at least below 1 @xmath154 where it influences our result .",
    "observations so far for globular clusters in the local group seem to confirm this picture ( e.g.  dubath & grillmair 1997 ) . in the case of the mass distribution",
    ", globular cluster formation seems to follow a universal mechanism ( e.g.  elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "the constancy of the to magnitude from galaxy to galaxy ( e.g.  the review by whitmore 1997 ) and the observed mass distributions of young clusters ( e.g.  brief review by schweizer 1997 ) support this picture .",
    "the possibility that size differences might indicate different formation processes for blue and red clusters was discussed in section [ gcsizes ] .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether it is only the mean sizes or also the mean masses that are affected .",
    "moreover , our assumption would fail if , despite similar mass distributions at formation , blue and red clusters are affected differently by destruction processes .",
    "there is a hint ( see section [ radial ] ) that this might be the case in the inner region , where the difference between the blue and the red to magnitudes is smaller by @xmath155 ( combining the @xmath14 and @xmath15 information ) than in the outer region .",
    "( we note for completeness that an age gradient in the population would have the same observable effect as a mass gradient ) .",
    "if this effect is real , the to difference of the total sample , as used , could be affected by a 0.1 to 0.2 mag systematic error .",
    "we estimate that this empirical determination gives about the right order of magnitude for the potential systematic error in our method and , in what follows , we will assume a potential systematic error of @xmath156 mag , which translates into roughly 4 gyr .",
    "note that for similar m / l values of the blue and red clusters , such a difference of 0.2 mag would translate into only a 20% difference in the mass characterizing the to .",
    "irrespective of the accuracy needed for our study , blue and red clusters _ have _ roughly similar mass distributions .      for completeness , we mention a method for checking the validity of these assumptions and a method for avoiding them .",
    "for the chosen filters , age and characteristic mass influence the to far more than metallicity , which is fairly well determined by the color .",
    "therefore , one could determine the mean mass difference ( and check the above assumption ) by obtaining an independent estimate of the mean age difference .",
    "an independent age estimate could be obtained with spectroscopy of a large number of globular clusters and the measurement of an age  sensitive absorption line index .",
    "several tens of h@xmath157 measurements in each sub  population would allow the mean h@xmath157 value to be determined to within @xmath158   which would translate into an accuracy in the mean age difference of @xmath159 gyr .",
    "this in turn would allow us to verify that the characteristic to masses of the red and blue populations lie within 10% to 20% of each other .",
    "an alternative method for determining the mean age difference without making any assumptions about the mass distributions would be to use mass  independent quantities that depend only on age and metallicity .",
    "band colors are such quantities .",
    "a plot similar to figures [ ps : mar ] through [ ps : wo ] , but in a color  color plane , would remove any uncertainties due to different mass distributions . however , it is impossible to find two colors in the optical and nir spectrum that disentangle age and metallicity as efficiently as the color / to magnitude combination .      in figure [ ps :",

    "if our results are affected by a systematic error , e.g.  if the smaller sizes of the red globular clusters do indeed translate into a lower `` mean '' mass ( such that the red to magnitude is @xmath156 lower  see section [ ml ] ) , the age difference would be affected by @xmath193 gyr .",
    "the above results suggest that the vast majority of globular clusters and stars formed at high redshift in this cluster galaxy . as already mentioned in section [ intro ] , several other lines of evidence lead to similar results for cluster galaxies .",

    "this , however , would force a revision of the merger scenario which clearly predicts that the red clusters will be younger than the blue ones .",
    "alternatively , if two sub  populations of clusters are coeval or if the blue clusters are the older ones , age differences of a few gyr between the different sub  populations could be explained in all globular cluster / galaxy formation scenarios , i.e.  the above  mentioned scenarios , merging ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) , or in  situ formation of distinct populations ( e.g.  forbes et al .",

    "however , we have to assume that age  metallicity dominates any dependence on galaxy type , and that globular cluster mass functions are intrinsically similar , which seems justified to first order ( e.g.  kissler - patig et al .",

    "[ extended ] ( @xmath206 , @xmath207 ) , as well as for galactic extinction ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) . using the absolute to magnitudes discussed above ,",
    "we derive distance moduli of @xmath208 and @xmath209 ( adding all errors in quadrature ) , i.e.  a mean @xmath210 ( where the error does not include any possible systematic error in the calibration ) .",
    "the corresponding distance is @xmath211 mpc .",
    "a quick comparison with distances derived for ngc  4472 by other methods shows very good agreement ( despite completely different calibrations ) .",

    "( 1990 ) and neilsen ( 1999 ) derived @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively , from surface brightness fluctuations .",
    "cepheid distances now exist for 7 spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster ( cf .",
    "pierce et al .",
    "1994 and ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ) . with the exception of ngc  4639 ( saha et al .",
    "1996 ) , which appears to be background to the main body of spirals , the mean distance to the other 6 galaxies is @xmath215 or 16.0@xmath2160.6 mpc .",
    "our gclf distance to ngc  4472 is in excellent agreement with this distance , which supports the view that the virgo cluster spirals and ellipticals are at essentially the same distance .",
    "the age difference between the two major globular cluster sub  populations in an early  type galaxy has been determined .",
    "we have developed an age differentiating method which uses the precise to magnitudes and colors of the sub  populations .",
    "we have applied this method to ngc  4472 , matching our observables to several ssp synthesis models .",
    "an extended  object analysis showed that at the distance of virgo ( i.e.  @xmath21716 mpc ) hst is capable of resolving single globular clusters .",
    "thus it is necessary to make an additive correction ( of @xmath218 mag and @xmath22 mag at the distance of virgo ) to the mean correction of @xmath20 mag ( for point sources ) when extrapolating hst photometry obtained in 0.5  radius apertures to total luminosities .",
    "this corresponds to a color correction of @xmath219 .",
    "we found the globular cluster color distribution in ngc  4472 to be clearly bimodal ( at the 99.99% confidence level ) with two peaks located at @xmath220 and @xmath221 corresponding to @xmath61 and @xmath62 when corrected for reddening and finite aperture .",
    "we determined that the red globular clusters have a color distribution almost twice as broad as the blue ones .",
    "we divided the whole globular cluster population into an inner and an outer sample , as defined by the hst different pointings .",
    "we used an improved maximum ",
    "likelihood estimator , which accounts for varying background values , to determine the to magnitudes for each sub  population in each radial sample ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : magcol ] ) .",
    "the to of the blue sub ",
    "population is the same for the inner and outer sample .",
    "by contrast , the red sub ",
    "population appears to be marginally brighter by @xmath136 mag in the inner region than in the outer region .",
    "this difference is of the expected order of magnitude if destruction processes act on the red sample within 5 kpc .",
    "the radial color distributions of each sub  population show almost no gradients .",
    "however , we detected an overall gradient of @xmath222 mag / log(arcsec ) in the system , which is mostly an effect of the changing ratio of red to blue globular clusters with radius ( cf .",
    "geisler et al .  1996 ) .",
    "taking advantage of hst s high spatial resolution , we estimated the mean sizes of the globular clusters using the @xmath146 parameter .",
    "the blue globular clusters were found to be larger than the red ones , as was already observed in m  87 ( kundu et al .",
    "1998 ) and ngc  3115 ( kundu & whitmore 1997 ) .",
    "the most likely explanations are that the size difference reflects different formation processes , or that red clusters are on preferentially radial orbits , while blue clusters are on preferentially tangential orbits .",
    "we used 4 different ssp models to derive the mean age difference between the red and blue sub  population .",
    "our underlying assumption was that both blue and red populations have similar mass distributions which appears to be valid at least at the 10% to 20% level ( which , nevertheless , corresponds to a potential systematic error of @xmath223 gyr ) .",
    "the mean age difference between the blue ( metal  poor ) and the red ( metal  rich ) sub  populations is age@xmath224 age@xmath225 gyr , where the error is the dispersion introduced by the different models ( for a given model the error on our method is @xmath2172 gyr ) .",
    "the images as well as electronic lists of the photometry are available from the authors . also available",
    "is the maximum  likelihood code as an iraf task used to derive the globular cluster luminosity functions taking into account the background variations over the field .",
