    "neutrino physics is entering a new era .",
    "the discovery of a relatively large value of the long - sought third mixing angle @xmath2 has raised hopes of completing the picture of the standard 3-flavor framework .",
    "the determination of the two missing unknown properties , i.e. , the amount ( if any ) of leptonic _ cp_-violation ( cpv ) and the neutrino mass hierarchy ( nmh ) are now realistic targets .",
    "leptonic cpv is a genuine 3-flavor phenomenon  @xcite , which can occur only if no pair of neutrino mass eigenstates is degenerate ( @xmath6 for @xmath7 ) and if all the three mixing angles ( @xmath8 ) are nonzero . now",
    "that all these ( six ) necessary conditions are known to be realized in nature , the next task is to ascertain if a further ( last ) condition is fulfilled , i.e. , if the lepton mixing matrix is non - real , or , equivalently , if the _ cp_-phase @xmath9 is different from @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "cp_-phase @xmath9 is already being probed by the long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator experiment t2k  @xcite ( and also by minos  @xcite with less statistical power ) in combination with the reactor @xmath2-dedicated experiments  @xcite , which `` fix '' @xmath2 independently of @xmath9 .",
    "some ( weaker ) information on such a fundamental phase is also provided by atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "quite intriguingly , all the latest global analyses  @xcite show a weak indication ( close to the 90% c.l . ) of cpv , the best - fit value of the _ cp_-phase being @xmath12 .",
    "an apparently unrelated issue in present - day neutrino physics is provided by the hints of light ( @xmath13 ) sterile species suggested by the short - baseline ( sbl ) anomalies ( see  @xcite for reviews ) . in the presence of sterile neutrinos",
    ", the 3-flavor scheme must be enlarged so as to include one ( or more ) mass eigenstates having nonzero admixture with the active flavors . in such more general frameworks ,",
    "cp_-phases automatically appear and , thus , the question naturally arises as to whether the current and planned lbl experiments , designed to underpin the standard _",
    "cp_-phase @xmath9 , also have some chance to detect the new potential sources of cpv . in this work",
    "we show , for the first time , that the existing measurements of @xmath1 appearance performed by the lbl experiment t2k , taken in combination with those of @xmath14 disappearance deriving from the @xmath2-dedicated reactor experiments , are _ already _ able to provide information on the nonstandard sterile - induced _",
    "cp _ phases .",
    "in fact , differently from the sbl experiments , in lbl setups the oscillations induced by the new sterile neutrino species can interfere with those driven by the two standard squared - mass splittings giving rise to observable effects .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the interference among the sterile and the atmospheric oscillation frequencies induces a new term in the @xmath1 transition probability , which has the same order of magnitude of the standard 3-flavor solar - atmospheric interference term .",
    "working within the simple 3 + 1 scheme , we show that , for mass - mixing parameters suggested by the current sbl fits  @xcite , it is possible to extract quantitative information on two of the three _ cp _ phases involved in the model ( one of them being the standard phase @xmath9 ) .",
    "quite intriguingly , the statistical significance of the information obtained on the new _ cp _ phase is similar to that achieved for the standard phase @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , our analysis evidences that the presence of 4-flavor effects tends to resolve the slight tension ( present within the 3-flavor framework ) between the two estimates of @xmath2 extracted , respectively , from t2k and from reactor experiments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the theoretical framework needed to discuss the analytical behavior of the lbl @xmath1 transition probability in vacuum . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of the numerical analysis ( which includes the matter effects ) . in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",

    "light sterile neutrinos are introduced in the so - called @xmath15 schemes , where the @xmath16 new mass eigenstates are assumed to be separated from the three standard ones by large splittings , giving rise to the hierarchal pattern @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the fast oscillations induced by the new squared - mass splittings are completely averaged in all setups sensitive to the solar squared - mass difference ( @xmath19 ) and the atmospheric one ( @xmath20 ) . in this work , for definiteness",

    "such a matrix can be expressed as the product of six complex elementary rotations , which define six real mixing angles and six _ cp_-violating phases .",
    "of the six phases three are of the majorana type and are unobservable in oscillation processes , while the three remaining ones are of the dirac type .",
    "as it will appear clear in what follows , for the treatment of the transitions involved in lbl setups , a particularly convenient choice of the parameterization of the mixing matrix is instead of @xmath27 , i.e. by replacing the product @xmath28 with @xmath29 . ]",

    "consider , however , an ideal case where in the same setups we have @xmath58 , while leaving @xmath59 unaltered ( this would correspond to a much larger value of @xmath60 ) . in this situation , the average over the finite energy resolution of the experiment would wash out the fast oscillating terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asy_1 ] ) , giving rise to @xmath61 thus obtaining for the _ cp _ asymmetry @xmath62 this ideal case shows that cpv is not erased by the average over the two large frequencies .",
    "cpv cancellation would occur only if the third frequency were also very large ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "consider now a realistic 3 + 1 scheme . in this case , the oscillations induced by the three new large oscillation frequencies @xmath64 will get averaged , and the information on their values will be lost . on the other hand , cpv effects will survive , since there are other two finite frequencies , the atmospheric [ @xmath65 and the solar one ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be natural to expect a dependency on the _ cp_-phases in the flavor conversion process .",
    "let us now come to the expression of the @xmath1 transition probability probed in t2k .",
    "we recall that in the 3-flavor vacuum case , such a probability can be written as the sum of three terms @xmath66 where the first two terms are positive definite probabilities induced by the atmospheric and the solar squared - mass splittings , while the third is generated by their interference and can assume both positive and negative values .",
    "an expansion in the small parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( supposed to have the same order @xmath69 ) provides , at the second order in @xmath69 , the well - known expressions  @xcite @xmath70 while all these three terms are formally of the same ( second ) order in @xmath69 , they have quite different sizes , since @xmath71 is much smaller than @xmath72 . around the first oscillation maximum ( @xmath73 ) probed by t2k , the atmospheric term is @xmath74 , the interference term is @xmath75 , and the solar term is @xmath76 . indeed , a different kind of expansion , considering @xmath77 and @xmath78 , is more appropriate , as already evidenced in  @xcite . in this case",
    ", an expansion at the third order gives only the ( leading ) atmospheric term ( @xmath79 ) and the ( subleading ) interference term ( @xmath80 ) . at the fourth order one recovers the solar term @xmath81 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pme_3nu_vac_sol ] ) , and two additional terms  @xcite .",
    "the first term can be interpreted as a tiny modification of the atmospheric term @xmath82 , and the second one as a very small change of the interference term @xmath83 .",
    "all three fourth - order terms , for the t2k baseline , have size @xmath84 and have negligible impact .",
    "let us now come to the 4-flavor case .",
    "the analyses of the sbl anomalies  @xcite point towards values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 which have sizes very similar to @xmath72 .",
    "hence , for the purposes of this work , which is limited to the sbl - preferred region , it is meaningful to assume that all these parameters have the same common order @xmath69 and to consider @xmath78 . after averaging over the fast oscillations induced by the large frequency @xmath87 , at the fourth order in @xmath69 , we find @xmath88",
    "the first term is the 3-flavor probability multiplied by the suppression factor @xmath89 ) .",
    "the second and third terms can be ascribed , respectively , to the interference of the atmospheric and solar frequencies with the new large frequency , which does not appear in the formulas since it has been averaged out . the last term can be interpreted as the averaged transition probability in an effective 2-flavor description . as might have been expected , the transition probability is the sum of six contributions @xmath90 the first two terms and the fourth one coincide ( apart from the suppression factor @xmath91 ) with the three standard 3-flavor terms in eqs .",

    "we can observe that the last three terms depend on the product @xmath99 , and , therefore , they depend on the effective appearance mixing angle , defined as @xmath100 which is the amplitude probed by the sbl @xmath1 appearance experiments .",

    "we plot the maximum absolute value for the three interference terms ( which can be positive or negative ) .",
    "the vertical gray band indicates the range allowed by the sbl anomalies .",
    "as expected from the discussion above , in this range , only the leading atmospheric and the two subleading interference terms are relevant , and the 4-flavor transition probability is approximately given by @xmath112 remarkably , the amplitude of the new ( atmospheric - sterile ) interference term is almost identical to that of the standard ( solar - atmospheric ) interference term . as a consequence , a big impact is expected on the regions reconstructed by the experiment t2k for the _ cp_-phase @xmath113 .",
    "more importantly , a similar sensitivity to the two _ cp_-phases @xmath113 and @xmath4 is expected in the combination of t2k with the reactor experiments .",
    "the quantitative verification of these qualitative expectations will be the subject of the next section .",
    "in our numerical analysis we include the reactor experiments daya bay and reno and the lbl experiment t2k .",
    "concerning t2k the analysis is slightly different for the two cases of 3 and 4 flavors , since in this last case there are appreciable oscillation effects not only at the far detector ( fd ) , super - kamiokande , but also at the near detector ( nd ) , nd280 , which must be taken into account .",
    "for this reason , we discuss the two cases separately . in the calculation of the oscillation probability we have included the msw effects following the prescriptions described in the appendix .",
    "the analysis of the reactor experiments is performed using the total rate information and following the approach described in detail in  @xcite . for both experiments",
    "we have used the latest data presented at the neutrino 2014 conference  @xcite based on 621 live days ( daya bay ) and 800 live days ( reno ) . since the electron antineutrino survival probability probed by these experiments is independent of the _ cp_-violating phases ( standard and nonstandard ) ,",
    "their estimate of @xmath2 does not depend on their values .",
    "we recall that such an estimate is extracted using the ratio of the event rates measured at the far and the near sites . since the fast oscillations induced by @xmath114 are averaged out at both detector sites , daya bay and reno",
    "are not sensitive to 4-flavor effects . as a result ,",
    "their estimate of @xmath2 is independent of the mixing angle @xmath115 provided that it is confined to vary in the range we are exploring .",
    ", being proportional to @xmath116 , and are completely negligible .",
    "] finally , it must be noted that the estimate of @xmath2 is essentially identical for the two cases of normal hierarchy ( nh ) and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "we use the t2k results of the @xmath1 appearance searches  @xcite , which reported 28 events with an estimated background of 4.92 events . in order to calculate the theoretical expectation for the total number of events and their binned spectrum in the reconstructed neutrino energy , we convolve the product of the @xmath117 flux  @xcite ( tables provided on the t2k home page  @xcite ) , the charged current quasielastic cross - section ( estimated from  @xcite ) , and the @xmath1 transition probability , with an appropriate energy resolution function , which incorporates the correlation among the true and the reconstructed neutrino energy . for the energy resolution",
    "we have adopted a gaussian function with width @xmath118 .",
    "we have checked that our prediction for the binned spectrum of events is in very good agreement with that shown by the collaboration in  @xcite .",
    "we have performed the analysis using both the total rate information and the full spectrum , observing very small differences between the two cases .",
    "this is due to the limited statistics currently available , and to the effect of the smearing induced by the energy resolution .",
    "as explained in the next subsection , in the 4-flavor case we could consistently perform only a total rate analysis . therefore , for homogeneity , in the 3-flavor case , we report the results obtained with the total rate information .      in the case of 4-flavor oscillations",
    "the t2k near detector is sensitive to the oscillations induced by the new @xmath114 , since at the baseline @xmath119 m , @xmath120 .",
    "regard this , it should be noted that the published neutrino fluxes @xmath121 ( both those relative to nd280 and their extrapolations at super - kamiokande ) are constrained with the measurements performed at the nd ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the available fluxes are not the original output of the dedicated simulation programs , but are a  postfit \" version of these .",
    "basically , the fluxes are anchored to the nd measurements , compatibly with the pulls of the nuisance parameters of the model of the original (  prefit \" ) fluxes .",
    "the anchoring of the fluxes to the nd measurements introduces an overall normalization factor and appreciable energy distortions , the typical size of which is @xmath122% .",
    "these effects can be appreciated , for example , in fig .  1 of  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is designed for the 3-flavor case , in which the oscillation effects at the nd are negligible ; the procedure in this case improves the estimate of the nonoscillated fluxes .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of 4-flavor effects , the available postfit fluxes are no more an accurate estimate of the nonoscillated fluxes , since they partially incorporate the effects of the 4-flavor oscillations occurred at the nd . in the range of the small mixing angles we are exploring in this work , at the nd",
    "it is expected an energy dependent suppression of the nonoscillated fluxes whose amplitude ( @xmath123 ) is modulated by the @xmath124 phase @xmath125 . a suppression of this size is certainly allowed by the nuisance parameters of the flux model .",
    "therefore , for the range of parameters under considerations , the postfit fluxes completely incorporate the 4-flavor effects ( if these are present ) .",
    "in this situation , it is problematic to perform an accurate 4-flavor spectral analysis from outside the t2k collaboration , since one would need to model the original fluxes ( with their uncertainties ) and perform a simultaneous fit of both the nd and the fd event spectra varying the oscillation parameters @xmath126 and @xmath114 . for these reasons",
    "we limit our work to a total rate analysis .",
    "we have checked that in the range of @xmath127 $ ]  ev@xmath128 , the total rate suppression at the nd varies in the range @xmath129\\%$ ] . for definiteness , in the analysis",
    "we assume @xmath130  ev@xmath128 , for which the total rate suppression is @xmath131 .",
    "consequently , we have increased the normalization of the published @xmath117 flux by the same amount .",
    "since the fd total rate is proportional to the product of the nonoscillated flux and the transition probability @xmath132 , in the fit , a larger flux will be compensated by a lower @xmath132 . by observing that the leading term of @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133",
    ", we can deduce that the estimate of @xmath134 will be slightly smaller ( @xmath135 ) with respect to the 3-flavor case , as we have explicitly checked numerically .",
    "therefore , when interpreting the results of the 4-flavor analysis , one should bear in mind that this ( small ) effect is at play , together with those ( larger ) described in sec .",
    "ii , which are genuine lbl effects .",
    "we remark that the fake energy distortions introduced in the fluxes by the nd280 anchoring procedure are also present , basically unaltered , in the far detector fluxes ( which are an extrapolation of the nd fluxes ) . for this reason",
    ", it would be pointless ( and wrong ) to perform a spectral 4-flavor analysis of the fd data using the published fluxes .",
    "as we have shown in the previous subsection on the 3-flavor analysis , the t2k sensitivity is currently dominated by the total rate information .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to expect that the total rate information will give accurate results in the 4-flavor case as well , provided that the fake distortions are of the order of a few per cent .",
    "of course , the situation would be different for values of @xmath136 much larger than those considered in this work , in which case a dedicated spectral analysis would be inescapable .",
    "the same conclusion would hold if the t2k @xmath1 appearance measurement had considerably larger statistics .",
    "a final remark is in order concerning the treatment of the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath137 .",
    "it can been shown that the far / near ratio in the @xmath138 channel is almost unaffected by 4-flavor effects , as we have explicitly checked numerically .",
    "therefore , the estimate of @xmath137 is expected to be very stable with respect to the 4-flavor perturbations induced by the small values of @xmath136 we are considering .",
    "therefore , in the 4-flavor analysis we have marginalized @xmath137 taking into account the constraint @xmath139 obtained , within the 3-flavor framework , from the @xmath138 disappearance measurement  @xcite performed by t2k .",

    "we have checked that the impact of nonzero @xmath40 ( and consequently of the associated _",
    "cp_-phase @xmath41 ) is negligible , even considering very large values of @xmath40 , well beyond the current bounds",
    ". therefore , the results of the analysis , albeit formally obtained for the fixed value @xmath163 , are indeed more general and are equivalent to those that one would obtain by treating @xmath40 and @xmath41 as free parameters and marginalizing over them .",
    "the insensitivity to @xmath40 in vacuum is obvious from the formulas presented in sec .",
    "the reason of its irrelevance also in matter is explained in the appendix .",
    "similar to the 3-flavor case , in the t2k + reactors combination , the ( _ cp_-phases - independent ) estimate of @xmath2 provided by the reactor experiments selects those subregions of the t2k bands that have a statistically significant overlap with such an estimate .",
    "these , in turn , correspond to allowed regions in the plane @xmath164 $ ] spanned by the two _ cp_-phases .",
    "figures  [ fig:3pan_4nu_nh ] and  [ fig:3pan_4nu_ih ] display such regions for the two cases of nh and ih , together with the 2-dimensional projections that have the mixing angle @xmath2 as one of the two variables .",
    "as expected a preference for values of @xmath165 emerges .",
    "the absence of _ cp _ violation is disfavored at a slightly lower confidence level in comparison with the 3-flavor case .",
    "this is imputable to the larger freedom allowed by the larger parameter space available in the 3 + 1 scheme .",
    "we have investigated the impact of light ( @xmath0 ev ) sterile neutrinos in the long - baseline experiment t2k .",
    "we have shown that , within the 3 + 1 scheme , for mass - mixing parameters suggested by the short - baseline anomalies , the new term appearing in the @xmath1 transition probability arising from the interference between the sterile and the atmospheric oscillation frequencies has the same order of magnitude of the standard 3-flavor solar - atmospheric interference term . as a result ,",
    "the current t2k data ( in combination with the @xmath2-dedicated reactor experiments ) are sensitive to two of the three _ cp_-violating phases involved in the 3 + 1 scheme . in particular , we found that both the standard phase and the new one ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 in our parameterization choice ) tend to have a common best - fit value @xmath166 .",
    "in addition , quite intriguingly , our analysis shows that the inclusion of sterile neutrino effects leads to better agreement of the two estimates of @xmath2 obtained , respectively , from t2k and reactor data .",
    "our results make it evident that t2k and other similar lbl experiments ( like minos and no@xmath167a in the near future ) should be routinely included in the global fits involving sterile neutrinos . finally , we stress that , in the eventuality of a discovery of light sterile neutrino species at the upcoming sbl experiments , our findings would represent the first indications on the sterile - induced cpv sources . the lbl accelerator experiments that are already operational , and those planned for the future ( lbne , lbno , and t2hk ) , will play a key role in extracting more information on the new cpv sector , the exploration of which has , with the present work , just begun .",
    "the hamiltonian in the flavor basis can be written as @xmath168 where @xmath169 denotes the diagonal matrix containing the wave numbers @xmath170 ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 being the neutrino squared - mass and energy respectively ) , while the matrix @xmath173 incorporates the position - independent matter msw potential  @xcite . barring irrelevant factors proportional to the identity , we can define the diagonal matrix containing the three relevant wave numbers as @xmath174 and the matrix encoding the matter effects , as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the charged - current interaction potential of the electron neutrinos with the background electrons having number density @xmath177 , and @xmath178 is the neutral - current interaction potential ( common to all the active neutrino species ) with the background neutrons having number density @xmath179 . for later convenience",
    ", we also introduce the positive - definite ratio @xmath180 which in the earth crust is approximately @xmath181 . in order to simplify the treatment of matter effects in lbl experiments",
    "it is useful to introduce the new basis @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the part of the mixing matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) containing only the rotations involving the fourth neutrino mass state . in this new basis ,",
    "the hamiltonian assumes the form @xmath184 where the first term is the kinematic contribution describing the oscillations in vacuum , and the second one represents a nonstandard dynamical term .",
    "since @xmath185 is much bigger than @xmath186 and @xmath187 and much bigger than 1 , we can reduce the dynamics to that of an effective 3-flavor system . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hbar ] ) one has that the ( 4,4 ) entry of @xmath188 is much bigger than all the other elements and ( the absolute value of ) the fourth eigenvalue of @xmath188 is much larger than the other three ones . as a result",
    ", the state @xmath189 evolves independently of the others . extracting from @xmath188 the submatrix with indices @xmath190 , one obtains the @xmath191 hamiltonian @xmath192 governing the evolution of the @xmath193 system , whose dynamical part has the form @xmath194 where , for brevity",

    "( [ eq : hdyn_1 ] ) takes the form @xmath198 which , for vanishing sterile neutrino angles ( @xmath199 ) returns the standard 3-flavor msw potential . for small values of such mixing angles ,",
    "the dynamical term is approximated by @xmath200 this shows that the corrections to the standard potential are of second order in the new @xmath201 s and further suppressed by a factor @xmath202 or ( @xmath203 ) ; in the earth crust , @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , for realistic values of the mixing angles , these corrections are @xmath205 , and hence at the level of a few per cent .",
    "taking into account that in t2k the _ standard _ matter effects are also small , being @xmath206 , we can deduce that the new nonstandard effects have amplitudes of a few per mill and have a completely negligible impact .",
    "we have numerically checked that allowing for very large values of @xmath40 ( which is the least known of the three new mixing angles ) even beyond the range currently allowed by the global fits , the transition probability is basically indistinguishable from the case of @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , the independence of the transition probability from @xmath40 , which is exact in vacuum , remains essentially valid also in the presence of matter effects .    for the calculation of the transition probability , it is useful to define the evolution operator , which , in the rotated basis , takes the form @xmath207 and is connected to the evolution operator in the original flavor basis through the unitary transformation @xmath208 taking into account the block - diagonal form of @xmath209 and the relations @xmath196 , one has for the relevant transition amplitude @xmath210   + \\bar u_{e4 } \\bar u_{\\mu4}^*\\bar s_{ss}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath211 oscillates very fast , the associated terms are averaged out by the finite energy resolution of the detector , and for the transition probability we have @xmath212\\\\       \\nonumber        & + &   |\\bar u_{e4}|^2 |\\bar u_{\\mu 4}|^2\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is completely general , except for the assumption of averaged oscillations , and connects the 4-flavor transition probability to the amplitudes of the effective 3-flavor system governed by the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
