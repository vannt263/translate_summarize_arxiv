    "this property allows the top quark to behave like a real particle and one can safely describe its decay in perturbative theory .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a superlative top factory with 90 million @xmath2-pairs per year which will allow us to perform accurate studies of the top - quark properties , such as its mass @xmath3 , total decay width @xmath4 , the effective weak mixing angle , and elements @xmath5 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite quark mixing matrix .",
    "the theoretical aspects of top - quark physics at the lhc are summarized in a recent paper @xcite .    since @xmath6 ,",

    "+ many extensions of the standard model contain more than one higgs doublet , and the new degrees of freedom appear as extra higgs scalars .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric sm , at least two higgs doublets are needed so as to cancel gauge anomalies and to generate masses for both up- and down - type quarks @xcite ; in the weinberg model of cp violation , at least three higgs doublets are needed in order to have spontaneous cp violation(see @xcite and references therein ) . both neutral and charged",
    "physical higgs bosons exist in all these extensions of the sm .",
    "the observation of charged higgs bosons , @xmath9 , would indicate physics beyond the sm .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will limit ourselves throughout this paper to the decay @xmath8 in a model with two - higgs - doublet , in which case there is only one physical charged higgs boson remaining after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "new results of a search for the charged higgs bosons in proton - proton collision at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath10 tev are reported by the atlas collaboration @xcite where the @xmath11jets channel in @xmath2 decays is used with a hadronically decaying @xmath12 lepton in the final state .",

    ", we evaluate the first order qcd corrections to the decay of an unpolarized top quark into a charged higgs boson .",
    "since bottom quarks hadronize , via @xmath19 , therefore the decay process @xmath20 is of prime importance and the particular purpose of this paper is to make predictions for the energy spectrum of b - flavored mesons in top decay .",

    "<S> we study the energy spectrum of the inclusive bottom - flavored mesons in top - quark decay into a charged - higgs - boson and a massless bottom quark at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the two - higgs - doublet model . to extract the result we work in the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme(zm - vfns ) using realistic nonperturbative fragmentation functions obtained through a global fit to @xmath0 data from cern lep1 and slac slc on the z - boson resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we study both the contribution of the bottom - quark fragmentation and the gluon fragmentation to produce the bottom - flavored meson ( b - meson ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the contribution of the gluon leads to an appreciable reduction in decay rate at low values of the b - meson energy . </S>",
    "<S> it means the nlo corrections are significant . </S>"
