    "dendrites are one of the basic microstructural patterns seen in solidified metals . the mechanical behavior of the solidified product is often decided by the length scales set by these patterns .",
    "study of dendritic growth is therefore motivated by the need to predict these length scales .",
    "the fundamental quantities that completely describe the growth of a dendrite at steady state under a given set of external conditions are its tip velocity and radius , which together define the so called `` operating state '' . despite considerable advances in the understanding of solidification science ,",
    "discrepancies still arise when one attempts to compare theoretical predictions of dendrite operating states with experimental observations .",
    "we find that some of these discrepancies derive from differences between the ideal conditions assumed in theoretical treatments , and those experienced by materials under actual experimental situations .",
    "the first theoretical treatment of the `` free '' dendrite growth problem was presented by ivantsov @xcite .",
    "he considered a pure dendrite , modeled as a paraboloid of revolution with tip curvature @xmath1 , growing into an infinite undercooled melt with temperature @xmath2 far from the advancing tip .",
    "the dendrite was assumed to be isothermal at the melting temperature @xmath3 , and to be growing along its axis at constant velocity @xmath4 in a shape - preserving way .",
    "ivantsov found a solution to the thermal transport problem , in which the dimensionless undercooling @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pclet number , @xmath7 is the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath8 is the ivantsov function .",
    "the temperature has been scaled by the characteristic temperature @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the latent heat of fusion and @xmath11 the specific heat .",
    "this solution presented a conundrum , because it showed that the transport problem alone did not uniquely specify the operating state of the dendrite , i.e. , the single combination of @xmath1 and @xmath4 observed in experiments .",
    "additional considerations , such as the effect of curvature on the melting point @xcite , stability @xcite and eventually the anisotropy of the surface tension @xcite , led to a second condition @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called the _ selection constant _ , and @xmath14 is the capillary length .",
    "the combination of ivantsov s solution ( modified for surface tension and its anisotropy ) and the condition @xmath13 is constant gives a unique operating state .",
    "numerical simulations using the phase - field method @xcite at large values of @xmath15 , have found agreement with the predictions of this body of work , known as _",
    "microscopic solvability theory_.    glicksman and co - workers developed experimental techniques for studying the solidification of pure materials , with the objective of observing the operating state .",
    "they performed experiments with phosphorous @xcite , and transparent analog alloys like succinonitrile ( scn ) @xcite and pivalic acid ( pva ) @xcite .",
    "the results of these careful experiments found some areas of agreement with microscopic solvability theory , in particular , the value of @xmath13 was found to be constant , but the operating combination of @xmath1 and @xmath4 did not agree .",
    "provatas , _ et al .",
    "_ were able to explain this discrepancy by showing that for the low undercooling conditions found in the experiments , interaction between neighboring dendrite branches @xcite affected the operating state .",
    "experiments have also been performed to examine the role of superimposed fluid flow on dendritic growth .",
    "gill and coworkers @xcite used scn in a special cylindrical chamber with a bellows to effect fluid flow .",
    "bouissou and pelc @xcite performed experiments with a flowing alloy of pva and a seed confined between microscope slides .",
    "saville and beaghton @xcite presented a theoretical analysis which extended ivantsov s solution to consider the superimposed flow .",
    "@xcite performed phase - field simulations of these experiments , and once again found discrepancies with theory .",
    "they conjectured that the differences arose because of the effect of finite containers in the experiments , leading to boundary conditions which differed from the assumptions of infinite media used in the theory .",
    "dendrite tip theories for constrained growth , such as directional solidification of dilute binary alloys between microscope slides , have been developed by trivedi @xcite and , kurz and fisher @xcite .",
    "they have shown that a relationship of the form @xmath16 , should hold for constrained growth just as in free dendrite growth .",
    "early experiments by somboonsuk _",
    "@xcite in samples with slide separation greater than 150 @xmath17 have shown excellent agreement with this theory .",
    "however , in recent studies liu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated that experimental results start to deviate significantly from theory when the slide separation approaches the scale of the primary dendrite spacing .    in this article",
    ", we systematically study the role of confinement on dendritic growth . since _ every _",
    "experiment is performed in a finite container , we feel that this effect can not be ignored .",
    "the first two authors have previously reported a study on confined growth in pure materials @xcite . here",
    "we extend our investigations to directionally solidified binary alloys .",
    "for purposes of continuity and completeness , we will again present results from our study on pure materials .",
    "for the binary alloy , recent experimental data from liu _ _ et al.__@xcite , will provide us with an avenue for testing our numerical predictions .",
    "the objective in a general solidification problem is to solve the equations governing thermal and solute transport , subject to boundary conditions on the solid - liquid interface ( moving boundary ) and elsewhere .",
    "if melt convection is to be modeled , one needs to solve the momentum equations for fluid flow simultaneously with the above transport equations .",
    "imposing the interface boundary conditions upon discretizing the governing equations poses a difficulty however , since the interface , as it evolves , will not in general align itself with a fixed set of mesh points .",
    "the phase - field method eliminates the sharp liquid - solid boundary by introducing evolution equations for a continuous order parameter @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 corresponds to liquid , solid and interface respectively .",
    "thus , the arduous task of solving the transport equations separately in liquid and solid domains while simultaneously satisfying boundary conditions on arbitrarily shaped interfaces , is replaced by that of solving a system of coupled differential equations ; one for the evolution of @xmath20 and one for each of the transport variables ( temperature , concentration and velocity ) .",
    "phase - field modeling has been an active area of research in the past decade , and we refer the interested reader to original work by langer @xcite , karma and rappel @xcite , and beckermann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for derivations of the phase - field equations and selection of phase - field parameters ensuring convergence to the original sharp interface problem .",
    "the phase - field model introduces a parameter @xmath21 that connotes the finite width of the now ` smeared ' interface .",
    "karma and rappel @xcite showed that the model converges to the sharp interface equations when @xmath22 , where @xmath7 is the thermal or concentration diffusion coefficient , and @xmath4 is the nominal tip velocity of the dendrite . resolving the interface on a discrete mesh requires that the mesh spacing @xmath23 , while demanding that the diffusion field not interact with the boundaries leads to the domain size @xmath24 .",
    "satisfying these requirements causes calculations on regular meshes to quickly reach the limit of available computing resources .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath25 , fix @xmath26 , and enforce @xmath27 , then we find that the number of grid points per dimension on a regular mesh should be at least @xmath28 .",
    "this makes computations challenging on regular meshes even in 2-d , while 3-d computations may not be practical at all , depending on available computing power .",
    "we have mitigated this problem successfully by solving the equations on an adaptive finite element mesh @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "we use eight - noded trilinear brick elements stored using an octree data structure .",
    "a local error estimator indicates refinement or coarsening of the mesh , and this permits tracking of the interface as well as resolution of gradients in the other fields .",
    "there are six degrees of freedom at each node ( three velocities , pressure , temperature / concentration and @xmath20 ) , and a typical computation reaches well over one million unknowns .",
    "the finest elements ( @xmath29 ) , which are distributed near the interface , now need to be order of @xmath21 .    for our studies on pure materials ,",
    "we have used a finite element discretization of the 3-d phase field model developed by karma and rappel @xcite . in order to account for the effects of melt convection we adopt the formulation presented by beckermann _",
    "@xcite , who use an averaging method for the flow equations coupled to the phase - field . by appropriate choice of phase - field parameters",
    "we have ensured zero interface kinetics , which is a valid assumption for the range of undercooling we are concerned with .    for our alloy simulations ,",
    "we have used a one sided ( vanishing solid diffusivity ) phase - field model @xcite , with a frozen temperature approximation . in a directional solidification arrangement , for certain values of the problem parameters ( particularly when simulating real materials ) ,",
    "a considerable amount of time can elapse before the transients vanish and the solid - liquid interface reaches steady state . in that time",
    ", the interface can encounter the end of the simulation box if the equations are solved in a reference frame that is fixed globally , and if the box is not large enough to contain the diffusion field . to alleviate this difficulty ,",
    "we have solved the phase - field equations in a coordinate frame translating with the pulling speed .",
    "this saves some computational expense by allowing us the use of smaller boxes .",
    "we have not investigated the effect of melt convection in our numerical experiments with alloys .    in a recent article , echebarria _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have emphasized that the same choice of phase - field parameters that produced zero interface kinetics in the pure material can not also ensure this condition in the alloy model .",
    "this is due to the presence of certain additional terms in the kinetic parameter @xmath30 , that arise out of accounting for the discontinuity in the concentration field at the interface in a model with vanishing solid diffusivity . to ensure that the kinetic coefficient is negligible at the interface",

    "we evolve the nonlinear order parameter equation using a forward - euler time stepping scheme , while the linear thermal / solute transport equations are solved using the crank - nicholson scheme with a diagonally preconditioned conjugate gradient solver .",
    "the transport equations typically converge in fewer than five iterations per time step .",
    "the 3-d flow equations for the pure material are solved using the semi - implicit approximate projection method ( siapm ) @xcite .",

    "[ box ] . because of the inherent symmetry in the growth of the seed , it is usually sufficient to model one octant in three dimensional space .",
    "however , if forced fluid convection is incorporated along a particular direction , then the solidification rates into and counter to this direction become unequal .",
    "for example , if there is a flow parallel to the _ x _ axis , @xmath44 is no longer a plane of symmetry . to account for this break in symmetry",
    ", we have to model at least a quadrant of space , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 as planes of symmetry .    in the simulations with the pure material , the dimensionless thermal field @xmath47",
    "is subjected to zero flux ( @xmath48 ) boundary conditions on all surfaces .",

    "the velocity field is subjected to symmetry boundary conditions on the domain walls , and is forced to vanish in the solid ( @xmath51 ) by an appropriate formulation of the momentum equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we fix the lateral dimensions of the simulation box ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 are typical values ) , and study the interface evolution as a function of @xmath0 , which is varied from 128 to 4 . here ,",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath0 are in units of the interface width @xmath21 .",
    "for very small @xmath0 ( @xmath54 ) , steady growth conditions are reached relatively quickly for large undercooling . to save on computational cost in these runs ( where @xmath55 ) , we sometimes use shorter lengths for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , chosen to ensure that the diffusion field does not interact with the ends ( in the _ x _ and _ y _ directions ) of the box . for smaller @xmath15",
    "however , it typically takes much longer to reach steady conditions , and when melt convection is included , it can take impractically long cpu times to get converged results . for these cases , we terminate our runs when the tip radius / velocity versus time curves start to even out .",

    "increasing pulling velocity suppresses tip - boundary interaction by reducing the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer @xmath100 , similar to the effect of melt convection in pure materials , and should induce a leftward shift in the curves .",
