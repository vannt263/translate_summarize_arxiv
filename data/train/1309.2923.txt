    "recently cms collaboration has reported the suppression of the ground and excited states of @xmath0 in pb - pb collisions with respect to their scaled yield in pp collisions at the same per - nucleon - pair energy cms2013 .",
    "the state @xmath3 is least and @xmath4 is most suppressed .",
    "this result of increased suppression of less strongly bound states of @xmath2 system is consistent with the original idea of matsui and satz @xcite in which the states of higher radii are affected before the smaller one due to color debye screening in quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "however , this observation can not be regarded as an unambiguous proof of the existence of the qgp as there are other known mechanism , which can also affect the production of heavy quarkonia in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the recombination of @xmath5 pairs due to heavy quark stopping in deconfined state @xcite and statistical recombination of heavy quarks can enhance the production rates @xcite , whereas interaction with the comovers , mostly @xmath6 , @xmath7 mesons and nucleons , in the hadronic matter can cause dissociation of @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we require the knowledge of the cross sections of these processes in order to disentangle the suppression caused by qgp . in ref .",
    "@xcite the cross section of @xmath0 absorption by @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons are calculated using meson - exchange model . calculated",
    "values of cross sections @xmath9 and @xmath10 are about 8 mb and 1 mb , respectively near threshold energies . however , their thermal averaged values are very small due large kinetic threshold of the processes .",
    "it is , therefore , claimed in @xcite that the absorption of @xmath0 by comoving hadrons is unlikely to be important in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the cross sections of these processes are also calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite using quark potential model .",
    "corresponding peak values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are about 0.05 mb and 0.15 mb , respectively .",
    "these values are not only much smaller than those given in @xcite , but also give entirely different value of the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "however , the calculated values of absorption cross sections of @xmath14 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons in ref.@xcite are about 5 mb and 3 mb respectively . although the values obtained from meson exchange and quark potential models disagree , but either way the thermal averaged values of the cross sections are small enough to marginalize the effect of these processes .",
    "it is also known that production rate of @xmath0 can also be affected by the dissociation processes @xmath15 , especially in case of appreciable baryonic chemical potential haglin2000 .",
    "thus the values of the cross sections of these processes are also required before regarding the effect of dissociation by the comovers to be negligible for @xmath0 .",
    "apart from the effect of interaction with the comovers , the @xmath0 absorption cross sections by nucleons are also required to study its production in primordial nucleon - nucleon collisions in heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "it is known that some of the @xmath0 directly produced by these n - n collisions get absorbed by the other nucleons in pre - equilibrium stage of qgp @xcite .",
    "thus values of the absorption cross sections of @xmath0 by nucleons can significantly affect the expected yield of @xmath0 for rhic or lhc . accordingly in the present work we present the cross sections of these processes , which are calculated using meson - baryon exchange model based on the same hadronic lagrangian used earlier to calculate the @xmath0 absorption cross sections by @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons in @xcite and @xmath16 absorption cross sections by nucleons in ref .",

    "charmonium states analogous to bottomonium are also affected in qgp due to color debye screening . in this case",
    "the suppression was first studied in na50 @xcite experiment at cern and then by phenix at bnl phenix2007 . like @xmath17 the observed suppression in @xmath18",
    "could be the blend of different effects occurring in the deconfined and the hadronic states of the matter .",
    "absorption cross sections of @xmath8 by light mesons and nucleons , which are required to study the effect interaction with the comovers , are rather well studied as compared to @xmath0 .",
    "empirical studies of @xmath8 photoproduction from nucleons / nuclei @xcite and @xmath8 production from nucleon - nucleus @xcite interactions show that @xmath8-nucleon cross sections range from @xmath19 mb to @xmath20 mb .",
    "theoretically , these cross sections have been calculated using perturbative qcd @xcite , qcd  sum - rule approach sum - rule , quark potential models @xcite and meson - baryon exchange models based on the hadronic lagrangian having su(4 ) flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the values of the cross sections obtained from quark potential model and meson - baryon exchange models tend to agree with the empirical values , but are much larger than those from pqcd or qcd sum - rule approach .",
    "the higher values of the cross sections suggest that the absorption of @xmath8 by the comovers may play significant role . on the other hand it is also suggested in refs . @xcite",
    "that at higher collision energy accessible at lhc , large @xmath21 pairs production could result into @xmath8 enhancement due to heavy quark stopping effect in qgp .",
    "recent studies of @xmath8 in alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) at lhc has hinted at this regeneration effect alice2011 . beside the systems of quarkonia , the experimental studies of the production of heavy mixed flavor mesons and baryons in qgp are also suggested in refs .",

    ", we calculate upper bound on the decay width or least life time of @xmath0 in hadronic matter by the following approximate formula @xcite @xmath167    where @xmath168 is total hadronic density which is taken as 0.8 @xmath169 at @xmath165 mev and @xmath170 mb . the formula gives @xmath171 mev , which correspond to life time @xmath172 fm .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the life time of @xmath0 due to dissociation in qgp given in fig .",
    "this suggests that the effect of absorption of @xmath0 by comoving hadrons does not play any significant role .",
    "absorption cross section by nucleon as a function @xmath173 energy for the @xmath0 s produced at zero rapidity .",
    "conversion between @xmath174 and @xmath173 for zero rapidity particles is made by the formula @xmath175 .",
    "solid and dashed curves correspond to coupling set 1 and 2 respectively , whereas the dotted curve represents the values of the cross sections obtained from @xmath176.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ] [ fig8 ]     by nucleons as a function of temperature @xmath162 .",

    "in this paper , we have calculated @xmath0 absorption cross sections by nucleons in meson - baryon exchange model using an effective hadronic lagrangian .",
    "this approach has already been used for calculating absorption cross sections of @xmath8 by light mesons and nucleons , @xmath0 mesons by @xmath177 and @xmath178 mesons , and recently for @xmath16 mesons .",
    "main input quantities required to calculate the cross sections are the effective couplings and the form factors . in this work the couplings are preferably fixed empirically , using vmd model , or by vector - current conservation .",
    "unfortunately at present no information is available for the values of the couplings @xmath104 and @xmath40 which are required to calculate two - body processes , so we specify them by the known values of closely related couplings @xmath179 and @xmath180 as suggested by su(5 ) symmetry . on the bases of two different estimates of the couplings @xmath181 and @xmath180 , we calculate the cross sections by applying two different values @xmath104 and @xmath40 .",
    "our results show that total absorption cross sections of @xmath0 by nucleons are almost same either way , though the cross sections of two - body processes are changed some what .",
    "so we conclude that a rigorous study of the couplings @xmath104 and @xmath182 can further improve our results for these processes .",
    "however , our results of total cross sections at high energy are not expected to change as in this regime the cross sections are mainly fixed by three body - processes , which do nt depend upon these couplings . another source of uncertainty in the cross sections comes from the form factors . in this work",
    "we use the monopole form factors in which the cutoff parameter is to be fixed empirically or using microscopic theories .",
    "however , in the absence of this information for the bottom mesons , we can constrain cutoff by ( rms ) size of interacting hadrons and find that 1.2 to 1.8 gev is an appropriate range in which it could be varied to study the effect of its uncertainty on the cross sections .",
    "same variation in the cutoff is also assumed in other studies of hadronic cross sections through meson - exchange model .",
    "we note that a known value of the effective cross section extracted from p - a data of e772 experiment can be used to fix the value of cutoff parameter .",
    "this allows us to provide definite predictions of the cross sections at the relevant energies for the upcoming rhic and lhc experiments on p - a collisions .",
    "our results could be useful in studying the effect of absorption of @xmath0 by nucleons in pre - equilibrium stage of qgp .    for the energies near threshold , we find much higher values of total cross sections as compared to the results obtained from pqcd .",
    "however , the corresponding thermal averaged values of cross section below @xmath183 are vary small . combining these results with the thermal averaged cross sections of @xmath0 by pion and @xmath7 meson , we find that the effect of absorption of @xmath0 by the comving hadrons after the hadronization is not important .",
