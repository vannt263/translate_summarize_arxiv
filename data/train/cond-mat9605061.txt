    "this instability appears in the tdhfa as an imaginary - valued collective - mode frequency . based on extensive calculations performed previously for the case of double - layer systems,@xcite the broken translational symmetry hf ground states that are found for larger values of @xmath151 will quickly lose their interlayer phase coherence , and the charge gap ( incompressibility ) necessary for the integer qhe will rapidly go to zero . in our view , the broken translational symmetry of the state on the large-@xmath151 side of this instability is likely to be an artifact of the hfa , which can enhance intralayer correlations only by breaking translational symmetry .",
    "when quantum fluctuations are included , the broken translational symmetry of this state is likely to be lost , but in our view the loss of interlayer phase coherence and the vanishing of the qh charge gap will remain .",

    "the interlayer coherence that provides for good interlayer correlations will be lost , along with the charge gap necessary for the qhe .",
    "this scenario for the disappearance of the qhe with increasing layer separation does not require that the tles make a transition to a bilayer system , as was hypothesized in ref .  .",
    "we have shown that tless , such as those fabricated by shayegan and co - workers , can be described using a simple tight - binding model , which allows them to be characterized in terms of a small number of parameters .",

    "we have estimated the dependence of the ground state of the system on model parameters for filling factors @xmath9 and @xmath123 .",
    "we propose that in triple - layer systems , as in double - layer systems , the qhe can occur at integer total filling factors , even when the charge is distributed among all three layers and there is no hopping between the layers .",
    "( tunneling would be required for noninteracting electrons to produce a gap at integer filling factors . )",
    "these qhes occur because of the formation of broken - symmetry ground states with spontaneous interlayer coherence .",
    "the distribution of charge between the three layers of the system is typically determined predominantly by electrostatic considerations , and states can occur with the electrons distributed among one , two , or three layers .",
    "our hf theory of the ground state shows that for physically accessible regions of the middle - well on - site energy and layer separation , a triple - layer phase coherent state is possible .",
    "the stability of this state was estimated using the tdhfa , and a phase diagram was constructed , delimiting the regions in the parameter space of the tles for which triple - layer coherence is likely to be found .",
    "the qh states studied by shayegan and co - workers at @xmath9 and @xmath123 show the behavior expected for phase - coherent states .",
    "in particular , they exhibit the qhe , even for small tunneling energies and unequal layer densities .",
    "additionally , the @xmath9 qhe is suppressed by increasing occupancy of the side wells at the expense of the middle well , while for @xmath128 , the opposite is true , in agreement with our findings .",
    "future detailed comparisons between our phase diagram and experiment will be facilitated by the possibility of following lines in the phase diagram for a single sample , by adjusting gate voltages so that inversion - symmetric @xmath9 and @xmath123 states occur for a range of magnetic fields . in any such quantitative comparison",
    ", it will be necessary to approximately account for the finite widths of the individual quantum wells , which we have not done here .",
    "as in the case of the double - layer coherent state , a useful footprint of interlayer coherence is unusual sensitivity to small tilts of the magnetic field away from the normal to the layers.@xcite the most convincing evidence for triple - layer coherence would be the observation of a strong suppression in the activation energy of the 3lqh states due to the application of a moderate parallel magnetic field .",
    "the state of the triple - layer system in a tilted magnetic field is most informatively described using a field - theoretical approach .",
    "we have calculated the magnitude of the parallel field required to suppress the activation energy as a function of the layer density , for both triple - layer and unbalanced double - layer systems .",
