    "interstellar filaments have recently attracted much attention , especially since the herschel satellite revealed a wealth of filamentary structures in both star - forming and quiescent clouds @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these filaments are fundamental building blocks of molecular clouds and that they must play an important role for star formation @xcite .",
    "this is because the dense gas is organized in filamentary structures .",
    "star - forming cores appear primarily along dense filaments @xcite , with young star clusters being located at their intersections @xcite .",
    "a key property obtained from recent observations and simulations of interstellar filaments is that they seem to have an almost universal characteristic width of about @xmath8 @xcite , coherent velocity structures @xcite and orientations preferentially ( but not always ) perpendicular to the magnetic field direction @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to unravel the origin of the universality of filaments and to provide a physical explanation for the characteristic filament width of @xmath9 found in observations .    in order to make progress and contribute to our understanding of interstellar filaments , we use numerical simulations that follow the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds and the formation of stars within them .",
    "we compare six simulation models with different combinations of physical ingredients to evaluate their individual roles and combined effects : gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields , and jet / outflow feedback .",
    "we analyse the filaments profiles for each simulation model and compare them to observations .",
    "we find that only the models that at least have turbulence included produce filament distributions and widths consistent with observations , while filaments in the gravity - only models are significantly narrower by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "based on the finding that only models with turbulence produce realistic filament widths , we provide a physical explanation for the observed characteristic width of interstellar filaments . in this theoretical model",

    ". we then present column density projections of our simulation models with detected filaments highlighted and radial filament profiles analysed , as well as a direct comparison with observations in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "our theoretical model for the university of filament widths based on the sonic scale of molecular cloud turbulence is presented in section  [ sec : physics ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use the multi - physics , adaptive mesh refinement ( amr * ? ? ?",
    "* ) code flash @xcite in its latest version  ( v4 ) , to solve the compressible magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) equations on three - dimensional ( 3d ) periodic grids of fixed side length @xmath2 , including turbulence , magnetic fields , self - gravity and outflow feedback .",

    "turbulence is a key for star formation @xcite , so most of our simulations include a turbulence driving module that produces turbulence similar to what is observed in real molecular clouds , i.e. , driving on the largest scales @xcite and with a power spectrum , @xmath10 , consistent with supersonic , compressible turbulence @xcite .",
    "this type of turbulence spectrum is consistent with simulations of supersonic turbulence @xcite .",

    "columns 11 and 12 : number of detected filaments ( @xmath17 ) and derived width ( @xmath18 ) of the filaments .      in order to follow star formation and gas accretion , we use the sink particle method developed by @xcite .",
    "sink particles form dynamically in our simulations when a local region in the simulation domain undergoes gravitational collapse and forms stars .",
    "this is technically achieved by first flagging each computational cell that exceeds the jeans resolution density , @xmath19 where @xmath4 is the sound speed , @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath21 is the local jeans length .",
    "this determines the sink particle accretion radius , @xmath22 , which is set to @xmath23 grid cell lengths in order to capture star formation and to avoid artificial fragmentation on the highest level of amr @xcite .",
    "if the gas density in a cell exceeds @xmath24 , a spherical control volume with radius @xmath25 is constructed around the cell and it is checked that all the gas within the control volume is jeans - unstable , gravitationally bound and collapsing towards the central cell .",
    "a sink particle is only formed in the central cell of the control volume , if all of these checks are passed .",
    "this avoids spurious formation of sink particles and guarantees that only bound and collapsing gas forms stars @xcite .",
    "on all the lower levels of amr ( except the highest level , where sink particles form ) , we use an adaptive grid refinement criterion based on the local jeans length , such that @xmath21 is always resolved with at least 32 grid cell lengths in each of the three spatial directions of our 3d domain .",
    "this resolution criterion is very conservative and computationally costly , but guarantees that we resolve turbulence on the jeans scale @xcite , potential dynamo amplification of the magnetic field in the dense cores @xcite , and capture the basic structure of accretion discs forming on the smallest scales @xcite .",
    "if a cell within the accretion radius of an existing sink particle exceeds @xmath24 during the further evolution , is bound to the sink particle and is moving towards it , then we accrete the excess mass above @xmath24 on to the sink particle , conserving mass , momentum and angular momentum .",
    "we compute all contributions to the gravitational interactions between the gas on the grid ( with the iterative multigrid solver by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sink particles ( by direct summation over all sink particles and grid cells ) .",
    "a second - order leapfrog integrator is used to advance the sink particles on a timestep that allows us to resolve close and highly eccentric orbits ( for details , see the tests in * ? ? ?",
    "powerful jets and outflows are launched from the protostellar accretion discs around newborn stars .",
    "these outflows carry enough mass , linear and angular momentum to transform the structure of their parent molecular cloud and to potentially control star formation in a feedback loop @xcite . in order to take this most important mechanical feedback effect @xcite into account",
    ", we recently extended the sink particle approach such that sink particles can launch fast collimated jets together with a wide - angle , lower - speed outflow component , to reproduce the global features of observed jets and outflows , as well as to be consistent with high - resolution simulations of the jet launching process and with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of our jet / outflow feedback model is that it converges and reproduces the large - scale effects of jets and outflows with relatively low resolution , such as with sink particle radii of @xmath26 , used here .",
    "our feedback module has been carefully tested and compared to previous implementations of jet / outflow feedback such as the models implemented in @xcite and @xcite . the most important difference to any previous implementation is that our feedback model includes angular momentum transfer , reproduces the fast collimated jet component and demonstrated convergence ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "all our simulations share the same global properties : a cloud size @xmath27 , a total cloud mass @xmath28 and a mean density @xmath29 , resulting in a global mean freefall time @xmath30 .",
    "models including turbulence have a velocity dispersion @xmath31 and an rms mach number of @xmath32 , maintained by the turbulence driving ( sec .",
    "[ sec : turbdriving ] ) .",
    "we use a fixed sound speed @xmath33 , appropriate for molecular gas with temperature @xmath34 over the wide range of densities that lead to filament and dense core formation @xcite .",
    "finally , models including a magnetic field start with a uniform initial field of @xmath35 , which is subsequently compressed , tangled and twisted by the turbulence , similar to how it would be structured in real molecular clouds .",
    "the magnetic field strength , the turbulent velocity dispersion and the mean density all follow typical values derived from observations of clouds with the given physical properties @xcite .",
    "this leads to the dimensionless virial ratio @xmath36 ( also typical for molecular clouds in the milky way ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to a plasma beta parameter ( ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure ) @xmath37 or an alfvn mach number @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite find an average alfvn mach number of about @xmath39 in 14 different star - forming regions in the milky way .",
    "thus , the assumed magnetic field in our simulation models is close to the values typically observed in molecular clouds and in cloud cores .",
    "we run six basic models , which  step by step  include more physics ( see table  [ tab : sims ] ) . in the first two simulations we only include self - gravity . the first one ( ` gravity only ( gauss ics ) ' ) uses gaussian initial density perturbations , while the second one ( ` gravity only ( turb ics ) ' ) uses turbulent density perturbations .",
    "neither turbulent velocities nor magnetic fields are included in these models .",
    "the third model ( ` turbulence+magnetic fields ' ) does not include gravity , but instead has a typical level and mixture of molecular cloud turbulence ( see   [ sec : turbdriving ] ) and a standard magnetic field for the given cloud size and mass . in the fourth model ( ` gravity vs.  turbulence ' ) , we include gravity and turbulence .",
    "the fifth model ( ` grav vs.  turb+magnetic ' ) is identical to the fourth model , but adds magnetic fields .",
    "finally , the sixth model ( ` grav vs.  turb+mag+jets ' ) is identical to the fifth model , but additionally includes jet and outflow feedback ( see   [ sec : jets ] ) . these six basic models were all run with a maximum effective grid resolution of @xmath40 cells .",
    "their key parameters are listed in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "we also run an additional model , which is identical to the sixth model ( with jet / outflow feedback ) , but has a lower maximum effective resolution of @xmath41 cells , demonstrating numerical convergence of our filament results ( see appendix  [ app : resnum ] ) .",
    "the lower - resolution model is listed in the bottom row of table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "our goal is to detect and analyse filaments in exactly the same way as was done in observations , in order to provide the best possible comparison of our simulations to observations , such as the ones by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in order to identify filaments in the column density maps produced from our simulations ,",
    "we apply the open - source tool disperse @xcite as in @xcite .",
    "the method is based on mathematical principles of topology and traces filaments by connecting saddle points to maxima with integral lines .",
    "the only free parameter of the method is the so - called ` persistence threshold ' , which we set to @xmath42 , which is the mean column density of our model clouds . @xcite",
    "set the persistence threshold to a ten times lower value than this in their observations of ic  5146 . in order to check the dependence of our results on the persistence threshold",
    ", we also use the same threshold as in @xcite and compare it to our ten times higher standard threshold in appendix  [ app : pers ] .",
    "this shows that the number of filaments increases with decreasing threshold and the average column density of filaments decreases , but the filament width does not change significantly with persistence threshold .",
    "once the disperse algorithm has identified all the pixels in our column density maps that belong to individual filaments , we compute radial profiles centred on each filament .",
    "the radial profiles are computed by selecting all pixels belonging to an individual filament and then tracing all the column density cells at a perpendicular distance @xmath43 to the filament .",
    "binning the average column density and column density dispersion in the radial distance @xmath43 from each filament yields the filament profile .",
    "we then compare the average filament profiles for each simulation listed in table  [ tab : sims ] , in order to investigate the dependence of the filament width on whether only gravity or additional physics such as turbulence , magnetic fields and/or feedback are included in the model clouds .",
    "here we present the main results of our filament analysis .",
    "we start by looking at the spatial distribution and morphology of the filaments detected in each of our six basic simulation models from table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "we then build the average radial profiles of the filaments and extract their characteristic widths and column densities .",
    "finally , we compare our simulations to observations .",
    "the spatial distribution of filaments in our six basic simulations is shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "we distinguish simulation models with different physical ingredients and combinations of these : gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields , and jet / outflow feedback ( cf .   [ sec : simparams ] ) .",
    "the detected filaments are highlighted in the column density projections of figure  [ fig : images ] , by increasing the column density of the pixels belonging to filaments by a factor of 3 , such that they stand out .",
    "the number of detected filaments is shown in each panel and individual filaments are numbered .",
    "as shown in appendices  [ app : res ] and  [ app : pers ] , the number of detected filaments depends on the numerical resolution , the telescope beam smoothing and the disperse persistence threshold .",
    "these dependences concerning the number of detected filaments are expected , because small - scale filaments will be lost by smoothing as the numerical or telescope resolution decreases , and low - column density filaments will not be detected by disperse , if the persistence threshold is set to a high value .",
    "thus , one should be cautious when interpreting absolute numbers of detected filaments and their average column density , because these depend on resolution and detection algorithm .",
    "remarkably however , we will see below that the characteristic width of the filaments neither depends significantly on the numerical resolution nor on the telescope beam smoothing ( as long as the resolution is comparable to or higher than the width of individual filaments ) and it does not vary significantly with persistence threshold , as demonstrated in appendices  [ app : res ] and  [ app : pers ] .",
    "we thus concentrate in the following on analysing the converged and robust physical property of the filaments , namely the filament width , obtain from stacked and individual filament profiles .",
    "filament profiles are the crucial analysis tool to determine the width of filaments . here",
    "we compute radial profiles of each filament individually and compare them between our six main simulation models .",
    "we first select all pixels belonging to a filament and then find each pixel perpendicular to this filament at increasing radial distance .",
    "the average column density for each radial distance is recorded .",
    "we repeat this procedure for each filament and compute the average column density and @xmath44-dispersion around the average .",
    "figure  [ fig : filprofs ] shows the filament profiles as solid lines with the yellow shaded region outlining the @xmath44-dispersion . as in figure",
    "[ fig : images ] , we compare the six simulation models with increasing physical complexity in the same order .",
    "the filament widths are determined by two independent fits with a plummer and a gaussian function shown as dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the plummer filament profile is defined as @xmath45^{(1-p)/2 } + \\sigma_\\mathrm{offset } , \\label{eq : plummer}\\ ] ] with the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where the latter is related to the filament width @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we experimented with the power @xmath46 and found that the best fits to the filament profiles were obtained with @xmath49 , so we fix this parameter to @xmath6 in the following .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in observations and simulations , respectively , also found that @xmath6 gives reasonable fits , unlike the steeper profiles with @xmath50 , which would represent an isothermal filament in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this seems to be excluded by the observations and we also exclude such very steep profiles in all our simulations .",
    "we explain the @xmath6 slope with a simple theoretical model in which two planar shocks overlap to form a filament at their intersection line (  [ sec : p ] ) .",
    "the gaussian filament profile is defined as @xmath51 with the filament width @xmath52 defined as the fwhm of the gaussian .",
    "this roughly corresponds to @xmath48 of the plummer profile with @xmath6 , equation  ( [ eq : plummer ] ) , as defined in @xcite and confirmed here .",
    "the column density offset is a fit parameter and results in @xmath53@xmath54 , close to the background column density in both the plummer and gaussian fits .",
    "we note that the filament widths obtained by fitting the column density profiles depends slightly on the fit range @xcite .",
    "it is important to choose the fit range such that the data are fitted well around the core of the filament profiles .",
    "there are two reasons for this : 1 ) the core of the filament profile provides the main contribution to the filament , 2 ) if large radii are allowed to be included in the fit , then the fit will contain contributions from overlapping filaments that are connected or close to the main filament for which the profile is computed .",
    "these overlapping contributions from multiple filaments lead to a systematically increased column density in the outer parts of the profiles ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which artificially broadens the filament profiles and leads to an overestimate of the width .",
    "in order to avoid this problem , we constrain the fit range to @xmath55\\,{\\mathrm{pc}}$ ] .        in summary",
    ", we see that the filament profiles shown in figure  [ fig : filprofs ] reveal a remarkably universal filament width of about @xmath56 for models that include turbulence ( panels c  f ) , while gravity - only models ( panels a and b ) have significantly narrower profiles with @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the universality of the filament width in our simulations must be primarily the result of turbulence , with gravity merely increasing the column density of the filaments , but not significantly affecting their widths . in contrast ,",
    "gravity alone is insufficient to explain the observed filament width of @xmath9 .",
    "we quantify the differences between gravity - only models and models with turbulence further , by showing the individual filament widths as a function of filament central column density in figure  [ fig : wocd ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 width also seen in very diffuse clouds such as polaris can be explained by turbulence alone , while the higher - column density filaments  yet also having @xmath8 width  for example seen in star - forming , denser clouds such as aquila , are a result of the interplay between turbulence and gravity .",
    "this trend is clearly seen in figure  7 in @xcite , where the authors compare the filament width and column density in polaris , ic  5146 and aquila .",
    "we find the same trend here in figure  [ fig : wocd ] : the filament width stays the same , but the column density is enhanced by factors of a few when the clouds are self - gravitating .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field and of feedback  while certainly affecting the number and spatial distribution of filaments ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : images])does not seem to change the characteristic properties of the filaments significantly ( comparing panels d  f in figure  [ fig : filprofs ] ) .",
    "we provide a simple theoretical model for this universality of filament widths , which we derive from the turbulent sonic scale in section  [ sec : physics ] .          in figure  [",
    "fig : tevol ] we compare our full simulation model including gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields and jet / outflow feedback to observations .",
    "we show the filament width in the simulation as a function of the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , i.e. , the gas fraction of the clouds that forms stars .",
    "we see that the width of the filaments is remarkably constant with @xmath58 over time and virtually independent of star formation activity .",
    "this is even more emphasised by the fact that pure mhd turbulence produces the same width , even without including gravity ( indicated with an arrow for the datapoint at @xmath59 ) .",
    "the simulations are in very good agreement with the currently available range of filament widths seen in observations @xcite .",
    "the agreement remains , even if we reduce the simulation resolution ( see the simulation model with a maximum effective resolution of @xmath41 grid cells in table  [ tab : sims ] and appendix figure  [ fig : filprofs_res ] ) .",
    "moreover , the agreement of our simulations with the observations is not affected by the coarser resolution of the observations . for instance , if we smooth the simulation maps to the herschel spire resolution obtained in @xcite as we have done in appendix figure  [ fig : images_smooth ] , we still find a filament width that is statistically indistinguishable from what we obtain with the full simulation resolution .",
    "this universality of the filament width is quite remarkable and calls for a theoretical explanation based on the physics of turbulence .",
    "we now provide a simple theoretical model for the magneto - sonic scale in order to explain the characteristic filament width of @xmath8 .",
    "the observations and the results of our turbulence simulations in figures  [ fig : filprofs][fig : tevol ] show a nearly universal filament width of about @xmath8 . here",
    "we provide a physical explanation for these observations .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite suggested that the sonic scale might provide a natural , almost universal scale of filament and dense - core formation .",
    "here we explain , derive and compute the sonic scale in detail and we compare it to observations .",
    "the sonic scale marks the transition from supersonic to subsonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is the characteristic scale in a turbulent medium , such as the interstellar medium , on which the mach number becomes unity .",
    "a fundamental property of any turbulent flow is that it exhibits a scale - dependent velocity dispersion @xmath60 , which roughly follows a power law . in the classical @xcite turbulence , which strictly only applies to incompressible gases ,",
    "this power law is given by @xmath61 ( for a review of kolmogorov turbulence , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the interstellar medium and especially the molecular cold phase , in which filaments and stars form , is highly compressible and supersonic , which means that the kolmogorov theory can not be applied to the scales where the turbulence is supersonic . instead",
    ", @xcite turbulence , which essentially consists of an ensemble of discontinuities or shocks is a much better description for the supersonic , highly compressible scales in a turbulent cloud . in this regime",
    ", numerical simulations find a steeper power - law dependence , @xmath62 @xcite than in kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "this power - law scaling of the turbulence , @xmath60 with @xmath63 , implies that the turbulent velocity fluctuations @xmath3 decrease with decreasing scale @xmath64 . eventually there must be a characteristic scale on which the turbulent velocity dispersion equals the sound speed , @xmath65 and this implicitly defines the sonic scale @xmath1 ( we provide the explicit definition below ) .",
    "since the density fluctuations in a super - alfvnic turbulent medium are roughly proportional to the square of the mach number , @xmath66 , the turbulent density fluctuations will quickly vanish near and below the sonic scale .",
    "this means that the incompressible ( no density fluctuations ) kolmogorov theory then provides a good approximation of the turbulence below the sonic scale , with a power - law exponent of @xmath67 , while scales larger than @xmath1 are controlled by supersonic turbulence with an exponent @xmath68 .",
    "we clearly see that the sonic scale is a fundamental characteristic scale on which the turbulence changes behaviour from being highly compressible and supersonic with @xmath68 for @xmath69 , to subsonic , nearly incompressible with @xmath67 for @xmath70 .",
    "this transition may in fact be the same as what has been termed ` the transition to coherence ' in observations of dense cores @xcite .    based on this",
    ", the sonic scale is explicitly defined as ( see equation  ( 22 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath71 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath72 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the cloud scale , the velocity dispersion on the cloud scale , the sound speed , and the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure , plasma @xmath73 .",
    "note that equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) only takes magnetic pressure into account , while magnetic tension is ignored , which would require a ( so far uncertain ) correction for magnetic field anisotropies . however , as long as the turbulence producing the filaments remains super- to trans - alfvnic , magnetic pressure is the only significant magnetic contribution , which is covered by our expression for the sonic scale .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) can be evaluated at any given scale for which a velocity dispersion is available .",
    "computing the sonic scale from the standard linewidth - size relation , @xmath74 @xcite , and taking into account its variations , as well as the typical range of magnetic field strengths ( leading to , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the limit in which the magnetic field is zero . ] , we find a relatively narrow range of sonic scales inside molecular clouds , .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) implies that the sonic scale depends on the linewidth - size relation @xmath75 . from this",
    "we can conclude that the observed narrow range of filament widths is a result of the relatively universal character of the linewidth - size relation in molecular clouds in the milky way .",
    "however , the variations of this relation then also provide a natural explanation for the range and variation of the observed filament width .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) further makes a direct theoretical prediction that the filament width may be systematically different in regions governed by a different linewidth - size relation .",
    "this might be the case in the centres of galaxies , such as in our central molecular zone @xcite or in other extreme molecular cloud conditions that alter @xmath3 and @xmath2 to be different from the standard linewidth - size relation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) covers these possibilities and it furthermore covers the dependences on the magnetic field strength ( through plasma @xmath5 ) and on the thermal state of the gas ( through the sound speed @xmath4 ) ) might also be applied to cosmic filaments such as recently studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , remains an open question , yet certain properties of cosmic gas such as the higher temperatures would indeed result in a larger sonic scale and thus in wider filaments . ] .",
    "moreover , equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) may explain the somewhat increased filament widths found in the simulations by @xcite .",
    "they use decaying turbulence simulations , which means that the mach number drops significantly over time and especially in the initial transient phase of the simulations when the first shocks form ( their initial mach number is @xmath76 ) .",
    "private communication with r.  smith leads us to conclude that the mach number has dropped to about when @xcite analyse their filament profiles , which means that their simulations have evolved off the standard linewidth - size relation by that time .",
    "given their analysis box scale @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ( they did not have a magnetic field ) , we find through equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) that their sonic scale is around , in reasonable agreement with their average filament widths of .",
    "even though the prediction by equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) matches the filament widths in @xcite reasonably well , we emphasise that equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) strictly speaking only applies to isothermal turbulence , while @xcite include a complex heating and cooling balance in their simulations , which only produces a nearly isothermal gas over a limited range of densities with a spatially varying sound speed @xcite .",
    "we would expect this to produce a range of sonic scales rather than a single one , leading to a wider range of possible filament widths , which is indeed what @xcite see in their simulations .",
    "we can go one step further and use equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) to explain the recent observations by @xcite of large - scale filaments in the spiral arms of the milky way .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find that the largest filaments in the milky way are long and @xmath79@xmath80 wide , i.e. , significantly wider than the @xmath8 found for small - scale filaments inside molecular clouds ( cf .",
    "[ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "they also measure velocity dispersions of @xmath81@xmath82 and dust temperatures of for their sample of filaments . assuming that the dust temperature is about the same as the gas temperature",
    ", we can use these measurements to compute the sound speed @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the velocity dispersion @xmath3 measured for their filaments is dominated by the scale that corresponds to the length @xmath2 of the filaments .",
    "we can now insert the observational data by @xcite into equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) and find an average sonic scale of @xmath83@xmath84 , which is in very good agreement with their filament widths of @xmath79@xmath80 .",
    "this implies that there might be another characteristic sonic scale , which corresponds to the transition from the atomic to the molecular phase in the ism .",
    "that sonic scale of about @xmath85@xmath86 would then be associated with molecular cloud formation , while the smaller characteristic sonic scale of @xmath8 is associated with filament and dense - core formation inside molecular clouds .    in summary ,",
    "the theoretical prediction for the range of sonic scales provided by equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) is in very good agreement with the range of small - scale filament widths of found in the observations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in various different milky way clouds .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) may further explain the larger filament widths of about @xmath79@xmath80 seen in the observations by @xcite .",
    "the smaller characteristic sonic scale of about @xmath8 represents the typical scale of dense - core formation inside molecular clouds , while the larger sonic scale of about @xmath85@xmath86 might correspond to molecular cloud formation from the atomic phase , i.e. , a characteristic scale for the atomic - to - molecular transition in the ism .",
    "while we can not rule out other possible explanations , the sonic scale provides an encouraging simple and plausible explanation for the observed characteristic widths of interstellar filaments .",
    "we see that our theoretical model for the filament width based on the sonic scale , equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) , implies that the filament velocity dispersion should be trans- to subsonic inside the filaments and supersonic outside . in order to test this",
    ", we show the velocity dispersion profiles of our filaments in the simulation that includes gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields and jet / outflow feedback ( model  6 in table  [ tab : sims ] ) in figure  [ fig : vprof ] .",
    "indeed , we find that the mach number ( the ratio of velocity dispersion to sound speed ) is below unity inside the filaments and greater than unity outside , consistent with what is found in a recent observation of the musca filament @xcite .",
    "we further see that the velocity dispersion outside the filaments roughly follows the typical scaling of supersonic turbulence , @xmath87 , which is the essential ingredient in the derivation of equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) for the sonic scale .      figure  [ fig : filprofs ] showed that the filament column density profiles follow a scaling of @xmath89 , i.e. , they are best fit with a plummer - profile exponent of @xmath6 in equation  ( [ eq : plummer ] ) . note that this implies that the filament volume density scales as @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 for @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite analysed the scaling of hydrostatic , isothermal cylinders ( filaments ) and found @xmath50 by assuming that the gravitational acceleration is balanced by the gas pressure gradient .",
    "in contrast , here we find @xmath6 , consistent with other recent works @xcite .",
    "most striking is the fact that this scaling is present in turbulence - only models ( cf .",
    "panel  c in fig .",
    "[ fig : filprofs ] ) .",
    "in other words , turbulence alone must be sufficient to yield such a scaling of @xmath91 or equivalently @xmath89 .",
    "here we provide a simple physical model based on turbulent compression in shocks to explain this nearly universal @xmath6 scaling of the filament density profile .",
    "in any planar ( 2d ) radiative shock ( purely hydrodynamic or mhd ) , the post - shock density @xmath92 scales inversely with the post - shock thickness @xmath93 , as @xmath94 .",
    "a filament occurs where two planar shocks intersect ,",
    "i.e. , the intersection of two planes is a line ( filament ) .",
    "thus , at the location of the filament , two planar shocks ( index 1 and 2 ) collide or intersect , such that the density of the filament scales as @xmath95 because shock collision is a multiplicative process in the density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rhoscaling ] ) thus provides a simple geometric argument for why the filament density profile scales with @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath6 , based on the collision of two shocks forming a filament .",
    "we see that this does not require gravity .",
    "it is solely the result of hydrodynamic ( or mhd ) interactions of shocks and these shocks are the hallmark of supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "as explained in the preceding section , @xcite provides a model for the density profile of isothermal and non - isothermal filaments , assuming hydrostatic balance .",
    "the prediction for isothermal filaments ( @xmath50 ) neither matches the observations nor the simulations , which consistently show that @xmath6 yields the best fit to the filament density and column density profiles .",
    "the @xcite model requires gravity and assumes hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "both assumptions are problematic .",
    "first , it is hard to see that structures in molecular clouds governed by supersonic turbulence should be in hydrostatic equilibrium . instead , the filaments likely form by dynamic turbulent shock interactions .",
    "second , quiescent clouds such as polaris have filaments with very similar characteristics as filaments in self - gravitating , star - forming clouds .",
    "thus , the filaments in very diffuse clouds such as polaris , where gravity does not play a significant role , can not be explained with the @xcite model .",
    "@xcite extend the analysis by @xcite by including an external pressure , but otherwise , they use very similar assumptions , including hydrostatic equilibrium , gravity and pressure balance to derive the density profile of filaments .",
    "while this model can explain some of the properties of self - gravitating filaments , it can not explain non - self - gravitating ones and still assumes hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "@xcite follow the same approach as in @xcite , but include the effects of magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite provide a theoretical model assuming self - gravitating accreting filaments . in this model , gravity is not only balanced by thermal pressure , but also by turbulent pressure and dissipation induced by ambipolar diffusion . as in the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite models , the model by @xcite can not explain filaments in diffuse clouds primarily governed by supersonic turbulence , because it requires the filaments to be self - gravitating .",
    "this is an important limitation , because observations by @xcite and @xcite , as well as our turbulence - only simulation show that filaments with the typical observed properties can already arise under conditions where self - gravity is negligible .",
    "we compared the properties of filaments formed in a set of six high - resolution simulations following the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation within them , combining different physical ingredients : gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields , and jet / outflow feedback from young stars . here",
    "we list our main findings and conclusions :    1 .",
    "using disperse , we detect complex networks of filamentary structures in all our simulations ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "we find that the radial filament profiles of the simulations that include turbulence reveal a remarkably universal filament width of about @xmath0 , while gravity - only simulations produce significantly narrower filaments with @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : filprofs ] ) .",
    "3 .   pure mhd turbulence can account for the filament properties in diffuse clouds such as polaris , while star - forming clouds such as aquila have higher column densities with a wider distribution , yet their widths are still @xmath9 .",
    "this trend is reproduced in our simulations that compare pure mhd turbulence on the one hand and mhd turbulence including gravity and star formation on the other hand ( cf .",
    "[ fig : wocd ] ) .",
    "we show that the filament width in the simulations with turbulence is in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "the filament width does not systematically depend on the evolutionary stage or the star formation efficiency of the clouds ( cf .",
    "[ fig : tevol ] ) .",
    "we explain the nearly universal width of interstellar filaments of @xmath9 with a theoretical model based on the scaling of supersonic , magnetised turbulence ( sec .",
    "[ sec : physics ] ) . in this model ,",
    "the filament width coincides with the sonic scale , which marks the transition from the large supersonic scales towards the small subsonic scales of a molecular cloud .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) provides the sonic scale as a function of the cloud scale @xmath2 , the velocity dispersion @xmath3 , the gas sound speed @xmath4 and the strength of the magnetic field parametrized by plasma @xmath5 .",
    "given typical molecular cloud conditions in the milky way , equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) yields a sonic scale of , in very good agreement with the observed filament widths of .",
    "we find that the filament velocity dispersion is trans- to subsonic inside the filaments and supersonic outside , and follows the scaling for supersonic turbulence , @xmath87 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vprof ] ) .",
    "this confirms the main assumptions behind the theoretical model for the filament width determined by the sonic scale , equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) .",
    "we explain the @xmath6 scaling of the filament column density with radius , @xmath88 , implying a volume density scaling of @xmath7 , purely with the scaling of the post - shock density with the post - shock thickness in two colliding planar shocks , forming a filament at their intersection line ( cf .",
    " [ sec : p ] ) . 8 .",
    "our filament widths are converged with numerical resolution ( cf .",
    "[ fig : filprofs_res ] ) and do not depend on the telescope beam smoothing as long as the observational resolution is comparable or better than the filament width ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : images_smooth ] ) . reducing the disperse persistence threshold by a factor of ten yields more filaments with lower average column densities , but the width is not significantly affected by the persistence threshold ( cf .",
    "[ fig : filprofs_persistence ] ) . 9 .   finally , we find that the magnetic field does not have a preferred orientation with respect to the filaments and that the magnetic field component parallel to the filament axis is slightly enhanced inside the filament , which is caused by turbulent compression of the field during the formation of the filaments ( cf .  fig .",

    "we find that the filament profiles do not depend significantly on the numerical resolution of the simulations .",
    "the measured filament widths ( both from the stacked profile and from individual filament profiles ) only vary within the fit uncertainties .          in order to investigate the effects of a finite telescope resolution",

    "the left - hand image shows the column density map with filaments highlighted in our full simulation resolution and the right - hand panel shows the same map smoothed to the herschel spire ( @xmath97 ) resolution ( @xmath98 ) as in the observations by @xcite . to facilitate the comparison",
    ", we here set the persistence threshold to @xmath99 , the same as in @xcite .",
    "beam smoothing clearly results in the detection of less filaments , because of the loss of small - scale structures .",
    "the filament width of those filaments that are detected , however , yield a similar filament width of about @xmath100 in the smoothed map as in the full - resolution map ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the finite resolution of the observations in @xcite did not affect their measured filament widths . what is clearly affected though , is the total number of detected filaments and their average length , because these strongly depend on the beam resolution of the observation .",
    "we thus expect to see significantly more substructure with many more filaments in higher - resolution observations to come in the future .        in order to get a feeling for the similarities and differences in the individual filament profiles between the simulations and the observations , we show in figure  [ fig : ic5146comp ] the profile of filament  10 detected in our simulation map from figure  [ fig : images_smooth ] side - by - side with filament  6 in ic  5146 from @xcite .",
    "the structure of both simulation and observational filament profiles is comparable , with similar widths , column densities and various overlapping side - filaments producing column - density excesses ( bumps ) on both sides of the filament main peaks .",
    "these overlapping nearby filaments contribute to the main filament profile and systematically increase the column density on both sides of the profile maximum .",
    "this shows why it is important to constrain the plummer and gaussian fits to a relatively narrow range around the filament core , in order to avoid overestimating the filament width by accidentally including overlapping contributions from other nearby filaments ( see the detailed discussion in section  [ sec : profiles ] ) .",

    "the bottom panel shows the same , but for a ten times lower persistence threshold , as in @xcite . while the average filament column density clearly moves down with decreasing persistence threshold",
    ", we find that the average width does not systematically depend on the persistence threshold . ]",
    "the persistence threshold in the disperse algorithm for filament detection is the only free parameter , but it is also the key parameter in the algorithm .",
    "the persistence threshold basically controls which structures are taken into account when finding filaments , which means that the resulting number of detected filaments naturally depends on the choice of the persistence threshold .",
    "@xcite chose a persistence threshold of @xmath99 , primarily determined by their signal - to - noise level . now",
    "the question is whether the filament width depends on this particular choice or not .    in figure",
    "[ fig : filprofs_persistence ] we show filament profiles obtained from simulation maps with our standard persistence threshold , which is the mean column density ( top panel ) , compared to the one chosen by @xcite , which is ten times lower ( bottom panel ) .",
    "our comparison shows that the filament peak column density systematically increases with the persistence threshold , but that the filament width is a robust measure , because it does not depend significantly on the choice of the persistence threshold .",
    "figure  [ fig : magprof ] shows the average magnetic field profile of the filaments in the most realistic simulation , i.e. , the one that includes gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields and jet / outflow feedback ( model  6 in table  [ tab : sims ] ) .",
    "we distinguish the magnetic field strength parallel ( @xmath102 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath103 ) to the filament in the plane of the sky , i.e. , what would be obtained from comparing the polarisation angle with the filament orientation in an observation .",
