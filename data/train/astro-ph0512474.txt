    "( @xcite and @xcite ) reported on the discovery of six isolated compact stellar systems in the fornax cluster , having @xmath15 mag and half - light radii @xmath11 between 15 and 30 pc .",
    "these objects had been interpreted as galactic stars in previous imaging surveys because of their star - like appearance on photographic plates . due to their compactness at luminosities comparable to average dwarf galaxies ,",
    "they were dubbed  ultra - compact dwarf galaxies  ( ucds ) ( phillips et al .",
    "@xcite ) . high resolution imaging and spectroscopy ( drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite ) place the fornax ucds between the sequence of globular clusters ( gcs ) and dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) in the fundamental plane of stellar systems .",
    "their m / l ratios are in the range 2 - 4 , at the upper end of values obtained for globular clusters .",
    "the luminosities and sizes of ucds are comparable to those of bright nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticals ( de , ns ) ( lotz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is not yet clear how objects as compact and luminous as the ucds may have formed .",
    "one much discussed hypothesis is the stripping scenario ( bekki et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which proposes that ucds are remnant nuclei of dwarf galaxies stripped in the potential well of their host cluster .",
    "it has also been proposed that most ucds are simply very bright globular clusters ( mieske et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although we note that the sizes of the brightest fornax ucds are much larger than those of globular clusters ( drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite , jordn et al .",
    "ucds could also be explained by stellar super - clusters created in gas - rich galaxy galaxy mergers ( fellhauer & kroupa  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "related to the latter scenario , bastian et al .",
    "@xcite propose that young massive clusters ( ymcs ) created in recent galaxy mergers may resemble ucd properties after a hubble time .",
    "maraston et al .",
    "@xcite show that the young massive cluster w3 in the merger remnant galaxy ngc 7252 will resemble ucd fundamental plane properties if aged to several gyrs .",
    "recently , ucds have also been detected in other environments : ucd candidates brighter than those in fornax have been found in the massive galaxy cluster abell 1689 ( mieske et al .",
    "@xcite ) , consistent with the idea that tidal forces play a major role in the creation of ucds .",
    "hasegan et al .",
    "@xcite report on the discovery of several ucds in the virgo cluster , some of which have high m / l ratios between 6 and 9 .",
    "those authors suggest a high m / l ratio as a criterion to tell ucds from globular clusters . also jones et al .",
    "@xcite have discovered 9 ucd candidates in virgo , in a survey analogous to the one performed by drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite in fornax . like the investigation of hasegan et al .",
    ", they find that ucds in virgo are close to the blue peak of the gc color distribution , in contrast to fornax where they coincide with the red peak ( mieske et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the data of jones et al .",
    "@xcite give a @xmath16 colour difference of 0.33 @xmath8 0.08 mag between fornax and virgo ucds , significant at the 4@xmath13 level .",
    "this color difference hints at possible different formation scenarios , which will be discussed in the course of this paper .",
    "de propris et al .",
    "@xcite show from hst imaging that the surface brightness profile of five fornax ucds is only matched by the brightest de , n nuclei in virgo , while the ucds are significantly more extended than fainter nuclei .",
    "that is not necessarily inconsistent with the stripping scenario , because ucds have luminosities comparable to the brightest nuclei .",
    "fainter ucds might have different scale sizes .",
    "furthermore , stripping processes can alter the structural parameters of embedded nuclei ( bekki et al .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of surface brightness profiles might be a biased way of judging on differences between ucds and embedded nuclei .    a note regarding nomenclature : the term `` ultra - compact dwarf galaxies '' ( phillipps et al .",
    "@xcite ) should be understood as a purely _ morphological _ description , referring to astronomical objects of luminosities comparable to average dwarf galaxies and sizes much smaller than those .",
    "this term does not imply a specific ucd _",
    "formation scenario _ , be it as remnant of more extended dwarf galaxies or as merged super - clusters .",
    "furthermore , in order to call a source ucd , it should clearly be distinguishable from the bulk of `` normal '' gcs , based on properties like mass , size or stellar populations . in our studies , whenever a separation between gcs and ucds is not clear , we therefore use the term `` compact objects '' .      in the fornax compact objects survey fcos ( mieske et al .",
    "@xcite  and  @xcite ) we have analyzed the photometric and kinematic properties of compact objects in the fornax cluster . our sample of compact objects was defined via radial velocity cluster membership , spanning a range of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) mag . at the bright end",
    ", these are the ucds , while at the faint end the sample is dominated by gcs .",
    "a main finding of the fcos was that compact objects with @xmath17 mag have somewhat different kinematics , spatial distribution and photometric properties than compact objects with @xmath18 mag . furthermore , the latter sample was more consistent with the gc system of ngc 1399 than the former one .",
    "this was interpreted such that ucds dominate the sample for @xmath17 mag , while gcs dominate for @xmath18 mag .",
    "specifically , ucds ( i.e. compact objects with @xmath17 mag ) are found to be redder by about 0.10 mag than the overall gc population of ngc 1399 .",
    "their colors are shifted about 0.2 mag red - wards of the well known color magnitude relation for des ( hilker et al .",
    "@xcite , karick et al .",
    "@xcite ) and consistent with a color magnitude trend of comparable slope .",
    "the nuclei of present - day de , ns are bluer than ucds by  0.10 to 0.15 mag ( lotz et al .",
    "@xcite ) , suggesting that ucds either have higher metallicities or older integrated stellar populations than the present - day nuclei .",
    "the magnitude distribution of compact objects observed in the fcos shows a soft transition between ucds and gcs .",
    "there is a 2@xmath13 overpopulation with respect to the extrapolated bright end of ngc 1399 s gc luminosity function .",
    "the findings obtained from the fcos are consistent both with the stripping scenario ( bekki et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the stellar super - cluster scenario ( fellhauer & kroupa  @xcite ) as a source of ucds . the major uncertainty of the data interpretation for the fcos is the origin of the color difference between fornax ucds , the nuclei of de , ns and the main body of gcs .",
    "the redder color of ucds as compared to nuclei either means older integrated ages or higher metallicities . within the scenario of bekki et al .",
    "@xcite , the m / l ratio of the stripping remnant ( nucleus + remainder of envelope ) is lower by a factor of two compared to the progenitor m / l , while the nucleus itself loses about 20% of its mass .",
    "this mass loss and the associated weakening of the gravitational potential will lead to expulsion of a substantial gas fraction out of the stripping remnant , a process conceivably supported by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "this would lower the efficiency of or completely halt subsequent star formation events in the naked nucleus .",
    "therefore one would expect the ucds to have older integrated ages and lower or at most equal metallicity as compared to de , n nuclei ( see also jones et al .",
    "one would _ not _ expect in the stripping scenario that the ucds are on average more metal - rich than still existing de , n nuclei .",
    "the aim of this paper is to lift the age - metallicity degeneracy inherent in the broad - band color measurements for fornax ucds , gcs and de , n nuclei , in order to better assess the validity of the various ucd formation scenarios . to this end",
    "we present new spectroscopic data for compact objects in fornax , obtained with the 6.5 m magellan telescope at las campanas observatory , chile .",

    "gaps of about 50 pixels separate the chips .",
    "we used the intermediate resolution 300 grism , which has a dispersion of 1.34  per 0.2@xmath21 pixel and covers a wavelength range of 3900  - 10000  . at a typical seeing of 0.8@xmath21 ,",

    "those members were chosen from the fcos and the investigation of ngc 1399 s gcs by richtler et al .",

    "the extraction of the one - dimensional spectrum from the two - dimensional output of cosmos was performed with the apall task within the iraf twodspec package . to test the absolute accuracy of the wavelength calibration ,",
    "these 1d - spectra were cross - correlated against the same template spectra as used for the radial velocity measurement in the fcos .",

    "for the brightest object observed , namely ucd 3 with @xmath24 mag , the s / n at the peak of the spectral throughput was around 100 .",

    "@xcite . in the latter paper",
    "the coefficient errors were calculated in the following way : after fitting the function , the independent variable vector @xmath14 is replicated 15 times , each data point being replaced by the fitted function value plus noise with dispersion given by _ the error bar of each data point _ ( as determined by artificial star experiments in mieske et al .",
    "this does not take into account the fact that there are _ physical _ variations in color that may go beyond the level of the photometric accuracy .",
    "a more conservative error estimate is achieved when the dispersion for the re - sampling is adopted as the _ dispersion of the original data around the fit . _",
    "the significances quoted in the following are based on this error estimate .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cmdall1 ] , for the sample as a whole there is a trend of redder color with increasing luminosity , significant at the 2.5@xmath13 level ( compared to 3.0@xmath13 in mieske et al .",

    "that is : the question `` can one explain ( some ) ucds as bright gcs ? '' must in the fornax cluster case be specified as : `` can the red bulge gcs extend to much higher masses / luminosities than the blue gcs ? '' .",
    "a possibility is that the most massive metal - rich star clusters preferentially form by the merging of several single , already massive clusters in the course of violent gas - rich merger events ( fellhauer & kroupa  @xcite ) .",
    "this is an attractive scenario if one assumes that indeed galaxy - galaxy mergers were the main creation channel for the entire metal - rich gc bulge population of gcs ( e.g. rhode & zepf  @xcite , li et al .",

    "one might expect a less violent , more homogeneous star formation , not necessarily leading to the creation of super - massive gcs .",
    "kravtsov & gnedin @xcite find in their simulations on gcs formation that the maximum globular cluster mass in a given region strongly correlates with the local average star formation rate . on the observational side",

    "this implies that the most massive gcs are created in the most violent merger events .",
    "kravtsov & gnedin also show that the mass of the most massive gc built in a dm halo correlates with this dm halo s mass , although with a large dispersion , due to the varying star formation conditions within the halo . according to formula ( 8) of their paper ,",
    "gcs as massive as the ucds ( 1 - 5@xmath2010@xmath51m@xmath5 ) must have progenitor haloes of @xmath3 5@xmath2010@xmath52m@xmath5 .",
    "this is only a few percent of ngc 1399 s dm halo mass ( @xmath53 , see richtler et al .",
    "therefore one may at face value not even require to merge _ several _ massive gcs to end up with _",

    ".    however , a strong argument against the identity ucds = bright single gcs comes from a size comparison : the five brightest fornax ucds have king half - light radii @xmath11 between 15 and 30 pc ( drinkwater et al .",
    "the typical @xmath11 of globular clusters is only @xmath543 pc ( jordn et al .",

    "we include the data points for the five brightest ucds from drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite and also plot the data points for all objects detected in the two acs pointings .",
    "note that the bulk of sources with @xmath55 mag are gcs , having the typical @xmath11 values around 3 pc ( jordn et al .",

    "the fact that they have a luminosity independent mean size is a physical effect , and not due to the resolution limit of the camera . at the distance of fornax , 3 pc subtend  0.03@xmath21 , or  0.6 wfc pixels .",
    "as shown in jordn et al .",
    "@xcite , the resolution limit regarding @xmath11 measurements is  0.25 wfc pixels ( @xmath31pc at virgo / fornax ) , which is substantially lower ( see also fig .  [ size ] ) .",
    "it is very remarkable that the luminosity of the metallicity break  corresponding to @xmath2 mag  coincides exactly with the luminosity brighter than which there is a clear up - turn in the size - luminosity distribution of fornax compact objects .",
    "brighter than @xmath12 mag one enters the regime where size scales with mass / luminosity , while fainter than that , size is independent of mass / luminosity .",
    "this strengthens the separation occurring at @xmath12 mag between a ) metal - rich objects at brighter magnitudes whose size scales with luminosity  the ucds  and b ) more metal - poor objects at fainter luminosities with luminosity independent sizes  the gcs .",
    "this luminosity limit corresponds to about 3@xmath56 , assuming an average m / l ratio of 3 ( drinkwater et al .",

    "if ucds are stripped nuclei , they were stripped of their gas and parts of their dark matter halo a long time ago ( see bekki et al .",
    "consequently they have had no opportunity of self - enrichment and star formation since the time of their stripping . in comparison to still existing nuclei that are embedded in a deep potential well with the principal possibility of further star formation events",
    ", one would therefore expect equal or lower metallicities and higher integrated ages for `` naked '' nuclei ( see also sect .",
    "[ intro ] , mieske et al .",
    "@xcite and jones et al .",
    "we find significantly higher metallicities , but can not tightly constrain the age difference .",
    "the large metallicity difference is not consistent with the stripping scenario as the major creation channel for ucds in fornax .",
    "we have outlined in sect .",
    "[ compnuclei ] that the metallicity difference between nuclei and ucds is slightly larger than predicted from their color difference of 0.10 to 0.15 mag .",
    "if one allows for age differences between ucds and nuclei to account for this `` deficit '' in color difference , one would require that ucds be younger than nuclei .",
    "this goes into the opposite direction of what would be expected in the stripping scenario .",
    "one conceivable way of explaining the metallicity difference between surviving `` embedded '' nuclei and ucds is that tidal stripping selects the most metal - rich de , ns .",
    "that is not pure speculation , since in some galaxy clusters , galaxy metallicities have been shown to increase towards the cluster center ( e.g. carter et al .",
    "@xcite for coma , ezawa et al .",
    "@xcite for awm 7 ) .",
    "this can lead to a selection bias because tidal stripping should affect only those de , ns that orbit close to the cluster center ( bekki et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the amplitude of the metallicity gradients found in the cited studies is only of the order of 0.2 - 0.3 dex over the entire radial cluster range .",
    "that is not sufficient to explain the difference of @xmath3 0.80 dex between ucds and nuclei found by us",
    ". furthermore , lotz et al .",
    "@xcite do not find any radial color gradient for fornax cluster dwarf elliptical galaxies , making a strong stripping selection bias unlikely .",
    "note that the ucds discovered in the virgo cluster exhibit slightly different properties , more consistent with the stripping scenario : the ucd candidates detected in the virgo cluster survey ( ct et al .",
    "@xcite ) based on their larger sizes than average gcs ( hasegan et al .",
    "@xcite ) are significantly bluer than the fornax ucds ( see also jones et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "they are almost as blue as the blue peak of m87 s gc color distribution ( peng et al .",
    "@xcite ) and are consistent with the colors of virgo de , n nuclei ( ct et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in agreement with this finding , evstigneeva et al .  @xcite report line index estimates for virgo ucds in which they are found to be old and metal _",
    "poor_. for some of the virgo ucds , hasegan et al .",
    "@xcite report high m / l ratios between 6 and 9 , which in case of virial equilibrium requires some component of dark matter .",
    "those authors suggested a high m / l ratio as a bona - fide criterion to tell ucds from ordinary gcs .",
    "hasegan et al .",
    "@xcite find that the two ucd candidates with highest",
    "m / l ratios are the most metal - poor ones , strengthening the need for dark matter .",
    "in contrast , the fornax ucds have lower m / l ratios between between 2 and 4 ( drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite ) and higher metallicities .",
    "this makes the scenario of ucds as successors of nuclei of dark matter dominated de , ns more likely for virgo than for fornax .",
    "the concluding remark we draw from this is : for the fornax ucds , the de , n stripping seems a less important formation channel , while for the virgo ucds the stripping scenario may be the preferred channel .",
    "young massive clusters ( ymcs ) : motivated by the difficulties of the stripping scenario to explain the fornax ucd metallicities , we discuss the hypothesis that ucds are successors of young massive clusters created in violent star - forming events .",
    "this hypothesis is closely related to the scenario of fellhauer & kroupa  ( @xcite and  @xcite ) that ucds may be merged super - clusters created in such mergers ( see also point 1 ) .",
    "one example for a possible future ucd is the ymc w3 in the star forming galaxy ngc 7252 ( maraston et al .",

    "starting points are its present observed absolute magnitude @xmath5916.2 mag , an assumed age of 300 myr and assumed metallicities of z=0.4z@xmath60 and z=1.0z@xmath60 ( hilker et al . in preparation , maraston et al .",
    "w3 is located close to the regime of the brightest fornax cluster ucds , shifted slightly to higher metallicities .",

    "@xcite also found metallicities of z@xmath610.5z@xmath60 for several other young and massive star cluster complexes in the antenna galaxies ( ngc 4038/4039 ) . that is an indication that some of the fornax ucds may have been created in an early violent merger event similar to those occurring with ngc 7252 or the antennas , but in a lower metallicity environment .",
    "the very small number of ucds can be explained by the fact that only a small fraction of the cluster complexes observed today appears to be gravitationally bound ( e.g. fall et al .",
    "@xcite , bastian et al .",
    "that is , only very few of the complexes will survive over gyr time scales .",
    "fall et al .",
    "@xcite argue that while between 20% and 100% of all stars form in clusters , the fraction of surviving clusters over a hubble time is between 10@xmath62 and 10@xmath63 of the total stellar mass . for comparison ,",
    "the total absolute brightness of all compact objects in fornax with @xmath6 mag is @xmath64 mag , about 6 mag or a factor of 250 fainter than ngc 1399 s absolute brightness of @xmath65 mag ( hilker et al .",
    "this is consistent with the fractional stellar mass range for surviving clusters as estimated by fall et al . and still leaves sufficient space for the main body of the fainter globular clusters .",
    "it is important to stress that in order to create a consistent link between ymcs and ucds in terms of metallicity , one would have to know the properties of an w3-like object created about 10 gyrs ago and then interpolate up to the present .",
    "star formation in the early universe was certainly not less intense than it is now , and mergers also happened more often than now . if the molecular clouds out of which early ymcs formed consisted of pre - processed material , one could have formed moderately metal - rich ymcs with fornax ucd metallicity , i.e. about 1/2 to 1/4 of the metallicities derived for present ymcs , relatively early in the universe .",
    "note that the cm trend amongst the fornax ucds / bright gcs ( see sect .",
    "[ cmrel ] ) may be explained with the ymc scenario : statistically , the more massive ymcs originate from more massive progenitor galaxies and more intense star - bursts ( see e.g. elmegreen et al .",
    "@xcite ) and might therefore also be more metal - enriched . + to finish the discussion ,",
    "we consider in how far global differences between the fornax and virgo clusters are expected to influence the occurence of the two competing ucd formation channels .",
    "this may help to explain why properties of virgo ucds fit better the stripping scenario , while fornax ucds are more consistent with aged ymcs .",
    "the fornax cluster has a two times higher central galaxy density and a two times lower velocity dispersion than the virgo cluster ( drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite , mieske et al .",
    "@xcite , richtler et al .",
    "@xcite , ferguson  @xcite ) .",
    "since the galaxy merger rate in cluster environments has the approximate dependence @xmath66 ( makino & hut  @xcite ) , one expects a much higher rate of galaxy mergers in fornax than in virgo .",
    "this qualitative difference should also hold at the time of the most violent galaxy mergers and hence ymc formation , even if both clusters were still in their early phase of evolution and had not yet settled into virial equilibrium .",
    "if the tidal stripping scenario and the fading of ymcs created in violent galaxy mergers are competing ucd formation channels , the probability of the ymc channel is therefore higher for fornax than for virgo .",
    "this fits to the observed properties of fornax and virgo ucds . to",
    "what extent is the stripping scenario influenced by the different cluster properties ? because of the higher mass of virgo and its correspondingly deeper potential well as compared to fornax , bekki et al .  @xcite",
    "predict the number of ucds in virgo created by stripping de , ns to be about a factor of three higher than in fornax .",
    "given that the numbers of ucds in virgo and fornax ( jones et al .",
    "@xcite and drinkwater et al .",

    "<S> various formation channels for the puzzling ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) have been proposed in the last few years . </S>",
    "<S> to better judge on some of the competing scenarios , we present spectroscopic [ fe / h ] estimates for a sample of 26 compact objects in the central region of the fornax cluster , covering the magnitude range of ucds and bright globular clusters ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find a break in the metallicity distribution of compact objects at @xmath2 mag ( @xmath3 3@xmath4 m@xmath5 ) : for @xmath6 mag the mean metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath70.62 @xmath8 0.05 dex , 0.56 @xmath8 0.15 dex higher than the value of @xmath91.18 @xmath8 0.15 dex found for @xmath10 mag . </S>",
    "<S> this metallicity break is accompanied by a change in the size - luminosity relation for compact objects , as deduced from hst - imaging : for @xmath6 mag , @xmath11 scales with luminosity , while for @xmath10 mag , @xmath11 is almost luminosity - independent . in our study </S>",
    "<S> we therefore assume a limiting absolute magnitude of @xmath12 mag between ucds and globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the mean metallicity of five fornax de , n nuclei included in our study is about 0.8 dex lower than that of the ucds , a difference significant at the 4.5@xmath13 level . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is marginally higher than expected from a comparison of their @xmath14 colors , indicating that ucds are younger than or at most coeval to de , n nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> because of the large metallicity discrepancy between ucds and nuclei we disfavor the hypothesis that most of the fornax ucds are the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped de , ns . our metallicity estimates for ucds are closer to but slightly below those derived for young massive clusters ( ymcs ) of comparable masses . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore favor a scenario where most ucds in fornax are successors of merged ymcs produced in the course of violent galaxy - galaxy mergers . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that in contrast to that , the properties of virgo ucds are more consistent with the stripping scenario , suggesting that _ different _ ucd formation channels may dominate in either cluster . </S>"
