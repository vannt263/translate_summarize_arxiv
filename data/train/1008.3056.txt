    "spectrum sensing is one of the key elements in opportunistic spectrum access design @xcite , @xcite . in literature , there are a few main categories of practical spectrum sensing schemes for osa including : energy detection , cyclostationarity based detection , and eigenvalue - based detection ( ebd ) ; see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "energy detection is simple for implementation , however , it requires accurate noise power information , and a small error in that estimation may cause snr wall and high probability of false alarm @xcite . for cyclostationarity based detection",
    ", the cyclic frequency of pu s signal needs to be acquired _ a priori_. on the other hand , ebd @xcite , first proposed and submitted to ieee 802.22 working group @xcite , performs signal detection by estimating the signal and noise powers simultaneously , thus it does not require the cyclic knowledge of the pu and is robust to noise power uncertainty .    in general ,",
    "two steps are needed to complete a sensing design : ( 1 ) to design the test statistics ; and ( 2 ) to derive the probability density function ( pdf ) of the test statistics . for spectrum sensing with multiple antennas , the test statistics can be designed based on the standard principles such as generalized likelihood ratio testing ( glrt ) @xcite , or other considerations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "surprisingly these studies all give the test statistics using the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix .",
    "it is thus important to derive the pdf of the eigenvalues so that the sensing performance can be quantified .    for ebd schemes ,",
    "the pdf of the test statistics is usually derived using random matrix theory ( rmt ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in fact , the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix have simple explicit expressions when both antenna number ( @xmath4 ) and ample size ( @xmath5 ) are large @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath5 is large especially when the secondary user is required to sense a weak primary signal , in practice , however , the number of antennas equipped at a single secondary user is usually small , say @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "thus the results obtained under the assumption that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are large may not be accurate for practical multi - antenna cognitive radios . in this paper ,",
    "our objective is to derive the asymptotic distributions of the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrices for arbitrary @xmath4 but large @xmath5 .",
    "the asymptotic results obtained form the basis for quantifying the pdf of the test statistics for ebd algorithms .",
    "it is noticed that there are studies on the exact distribution of the condition number of sample covariance matrices for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite , the formulas derived however are complex and can not be conveniently used to analyze the sensing performance . furthermore , there are no results published for the case when the primary signals exist .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : spectrum sensing ] presents the system model for spectrum sensing using multiple antennas .",
    "two ebd algorithms are reviewed in section [ sec : ebd ] , including maximum eigenvalue detection ( med ) and condition number detection ( cnd ) algorithms . in section [ sec : asym-1 ] , we derive the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics of the two ebd algorithms for the scenario when the primary users are inactive . in section [ sec : asym-2 ] , the results are derived for the scenario when there are active primary users in the sensed band .",
    "performance evaluations are given in section [ sec : evaluations ] , and finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the following notations are used in this paper .",
    "matrices and vectors are typefaced using bold uppercase and lowercase letters , respectively .",
    "conjugate transpose of matrix @xmath6 is denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 stands for the norm of vector @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 $ ] denotes expectation operation ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for `` convergence in distribution '' , `` almost surely convergence '' ; and `` defined as '' , respectively .",
    "suppose the su is equipped with @xmath4 antennas , which are all used to sense a radio spectrum for collecting @xmath5 samples each .",
    "one of the following two scenarios happens .",
    "* scenario 1 ( @xmath14 ) : * there are @xmath15 active pu transmissions in the sensed band , and the sampled outputs , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , can be represented as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 noise vector , @xmath21 is the @xmath22 signal vector containing the transmitted signals from the active pus , and @xmath23 $ ] is the @xmath24 channel matrix from the active pus to the su .    * scenario 0 ( @xmath25 ) : * there are no active pus in the sensed band , thus the sampled outputs collected at su are given by @xmath26    we make the following assumptions for the above models :    * the noises @xmath19 are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) both spatially and temporally .",
    "each element follows gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath27 . * for each @xmath28 , the elements of @xmath21 are iid , and follow gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath29 .",
    "thus the covariance matrix of @xmath21 is @xmath30 = \\sigma_{s}^{2 } { \\bf i}$ ] .",
    "* @xmath21 are @xmath19 are independent of each other . *",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath31 are not all identical",
    ".    two cases of gaussian distribution are considered : ( 1 ) _ real - valued case : _ we denote @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; ( 2 ) _ complex - valued case : _ we denote @xmath34 and @xmath35 ;    when there are active pus , we define the average received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of pus signals measured at su as : @xmath36 .",
    "given the received samples , @xmath37 $ ] , the objective of spectrum sensing design is to choose one of the two hypothesis : @xmath38 : there are no active primary users in the sensed band , and @xmath39 : there exist active primary users .",
    "for that , we need to design the test static , @xmath40 , and a threshold @xmath41 , and infer @xmath39 if @xmath42 , and infer @xmath38 if @xmath43 .",
    "let us define the _ sample covariance matrix _ and _ covariance matrix _ of the measurements @xmath16 of the sensed band as @xmath44 , \\label{eq : rmx1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "for a fixed @xmath4 , under scenario @xmath25 and when @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 which means that all the eigenvalues of the _ covariance matrix _ are equal to @xmath27",
    ". however , under @xmath14 and when @xmath45 , @xmath47 approaches @xmath48 based on assumption ( iv ) , the eigenvalues of can be ordered as @xmath49 .",
    "denote the ordered eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix @xmath47 as @xmath50 .",
    "we consider the following two ebd algorithms .    *",
    "* maximum eigenvalue detection ( med ) * : for med , the test static is chosen as @xcite : @xmath51 * * condition number detection ( cnd ) * : the cnd chooses the following test statistic @xcite : @xmath52    an essential task to complete the sensing design is to determine the test threshold , which affects both probability of detection and probability of false alarm .",
    "to do so , it is important to derive the pdf of the test statistics .    for arbitrary @xmath53 pair , the closed - form expressions of the pdf of the test statics are in general complex @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the primary users need to be detectable in low snr environment .",
    "for example , in ieee 802.22 , the tv signal needs to be detected at @xmath54db snr with @xmath55 target probability of detection and @xmath56 target probability of false alarm . to achieve that",
    ", the number of samples , @xmath5 , required for spectrum sensing is usually very large . in the paper",
    ", we thus turn our attention to derive the pdfs of the test statistics for any fixed @xmath4 , but large @xmath5 . the asymptotic distributions ( when @xmath57 ) of the test statics of the ebd algorithms will be derived for @xmath25 and @xmath14 scenarios , respectively .",
    "let @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and denote @xmath60 .",
    "define @xmath61 for @xmath59 , and @xmath62 . note that @xmath63 .    under @xmath25 , by theorem 1 and ( 2.12 ) in @xcite , we have the following proposition .",

    "thus , according to the joint density of the eigenvalues of a gaussian unitary matrix , similar to theorem 1 in @xcite we have the following :    [ prop : p2 ] for complex - valued case , when @xmath45 , the limiting distributions of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76    for complex - valued case , when @xmath69 , we have @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 . when @xmath79 , we have @xmath80    for a given @xmath4 , the limiting distribution , @xmath81 , of @xmath82 , can be calculated from or .      for med , @xmath83 , thus @xmath84 .",
