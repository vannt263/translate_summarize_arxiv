    "recently , the atlas and the cms collaborations discovered a new boson @xmath0 in the mass range 125126  gev.@xcite the observed diphoton decay rate is about 1.6 times larger than that of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson @xmath1 , while the other properties seem rather similar to the sm .",
    "this deviation in the diphoton channel , if established , would be an indication of a new physics beyond the sm .",
    "based on ref .  , we show that the atlas and cms data for the enhanced higgs diphoton branching ratio can be explained in the class of models with isospin symmetric ( is ) electroweak higgs boson . we also discuss the predictions of these models , which can be checked at the lhc in the near future .",
    "the main characteristics of the is higgs boson models are the following.@xcite a ) it is assumed that the dynamics primarily responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) leads to the mass spectrum of quarks with no ( or weak ) isospin violation .",
    "_ moreover , it is assumed that the values of these masses are of the order of the observed masses of the down - type quarks . _",
    "b ) the second ( central ) assumption is introducing the horizontal interactions for the quarks in the three families . as a first step , a",
    "_ subcritical _",
    "( although nearcritical , i.e. , strong ) diagonal horizontal interactions for the top quark is utilized which lead to the observed ratio @xmath2.@xcite the second step is introducing _ equal _ strength horizontal flavor - changing - neutral ( fcn ) interactions between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 ones . as was shown in ref .",
    ", these interactions naturally provide the observed ratio @xmath7 in the second family.@xcite as to the mild isospin violation in the first family , it was studied together with the effects of the family mixing , reflected in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix.@xcite    in this scenario , the main source of the isospin violation is only the strong top quark interactions . however , because these interactions are subcritical , the top quark plays a minor role in ewsb .",
    "this distinguishes the is higgs scenario from the top quark condensate model.@xcite    one of the signatures of this scenario is the appearance of a composite top - higgs boson @xmath8 composed of the quarks and antiquarks of the third family.@xcite note that unlike the topcolor assisted technicolor model ( tc2)@xcite , this class of models utilizes subcritical dynamics for the top quark , so that the top - higgs @xmath8 is heavy in general .",
    "here we also emphasize that while the top - higgs boson @xmath8 has a large top - yukawa coupling , the is higgs boson @xmath0 does not , @xmath9 . on the other hand , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 coupling constants are close to those in the sm . also , the mixing between @xmath0 and much heavier @xmath8 should be small .",
    "let us now describe the decay processes of the is higgs @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath12-loop contribution to @xmath13 is dominant in the sm , while the top - loop effect is destructive against the @xmath12-loop . in",
    "the is higgs model , however , the yukawa coupling between the top and the is higgs @xmath0 is as small as the bottom yukawa coupling , so that the top - loop contribution is strongly suppressed .",
    "the partial decay width of @xmath14 is thus enhanced without changing essentially @xmath15 and @xmath16 . a rough estimate taking the isospin symmetric top and bottom yukawa couplings @xmath17 is as follows : @xmath18 here using the pagels - stokar formula @xcite",
    ", we estimated the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the top - higgs @xmath8 as @xmath19 gev , and the vev @xmath20 of the is higgs @xmath0 is given by the relation @xmath21 with @xmath22 gev .",
    "note that the values of the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath23 , e.g. , for @xmath24@xmath25 gev , the suppression factor in the pair decay modes to @xmath26 and @xmath27 is @xmath28@xmath29 and the enhancement factor in the diphoton channel is @xmath30@xmath31 . for the decay mode of @xmath32 ,",
    "this model yields @xmath33    the values in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) agree well with the data in the atlas and cms experiments . however , obviously , the main production mechanism of the higgs boson , the gluon fusion process @xmath34 , is now in trouble .",
    "the presence of new chargeless colored particles , which considered by several authors @xcite can help to resolve this problem .",
    "we pursue this possibility in the next section .",
    "as a benchmark model , we may introduce a real scalar field @xmath35 in the adjoint representation of the color @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the is higgs doublet .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath39 also contains the is higgs quartic couplings @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath41 . the is higgs mass is @xmath42 , and we will take it to be equal to @xmath43 gev .",
    "the mass - squared term for the scalar @xmath35 is @xmath44 , and should be positive in order to avoid the color symmetry breaking .",
    "typically , @xmath45  gev .",
    "taking into account the @xmath35 contribution to @xmath34 , we find appropriate values of the higgs - portal coupling , @xmath46 as a typical value , we may take @xmath47 for @xmath48  gev and @xmath49  gev .    a comment concerning the is higgs quartic coupling @xmath40 is in order . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs mass 125  gev suggests that the theory is perturbative up to an extremely high energy scale  @xcite . on the contrary , in the present model , when we take a large higgs - portal coupling @xmath50 that reproduces @xmath34 correctly , the quartic coupling @xmath40 will grow because the @xmath51-function for @xmath40 contains the @xmath52 term . also , there is no large negative contribution to the @xmath51-function for @xmath40 from the top - yukawa coupling @xmath53",
    ".    one can demonstrate such a behavior more explicitly by using the renormalization group equations . in fig .",
    "[ lam ] , the running of the coupling @xmath40 is shown . taking a large higgs - portal coupling @xmath54 and the @xmath55-coupling @xmath56",
    ", it turns out that the coupling @xmath40 rapidly grows .",
    "the blowup scale strongly depends on the initial values of @xmath50 and @xmath57 .",
    "a detailed analysis will be performed elsewhere .",
    "last but not least , we would like to mention that other realizations of the enhancement of the @xmath0 production are also possible .    .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath40 and the sm higgs quartic coupling , respectively .",
    "we fixed the is higgs mass @xmath58  gev and took @xmath54 and @xmath56 .",
    "unlike the sm , the is higgs quartic coupling grows up due to a large higgs - portal coupling @xmath50 and a small top - yukawa coupling @xmath59 .",
    "[ lam],width=283 ]",
    "we studied the properties of the is higgs boson .",
    "the is higgs model can explain the enhanced higgs diphoton decay rate observed at the lhc , and also makes several predictions .",
    "the most important of them is that the value of the top - yukawa coupling @xmath0-@xmath3-@xmath60 should be close to the bottom - yukawa one .",
    "another prediction relates to the decay mode @xmath32 , which is enhanced only slightly , @xmath61 , unlike @xmath14 .",
    "last but not least , the lhc might potentially discover the top - higgs resonance @xmath8 , if lucky . for details , see ref .  .",
