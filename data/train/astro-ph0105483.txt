    "however , ultra - li - deficient , warm , halo stars do exist ( spite , maillard , & spite 1984 ; hobbs & mathieu 1991 ; hobbs , welty , & thorburn 1991 ; thorburn 1992 ; thorburn & beers 1993 ; spite et al . 1993 ; ryan et al .",

    "actually , there is vigorous debate about the existence and magnitude of any dispersion , and there are active controversies about trends with @xmath8 and [ fe / h ] ( thorburn 1994 ; molaro , primas , & bonifacio 1995 ; ryan et al .",

    "one can obtain bounds on stellar lithium depletion in halo stars .",
    "this has implications for stellar structure , galactic chemical evolution , and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . from a combination of the dispersion in the data , the detection of the fragile isotope @xmath9li in some halo stars ( smith , lambert , & nissen 1993 , 1998 ; hobbs & thorburn 1994 , 1997 ; cayrel et al .",

    "it seems that consistency of the bbn predictions and light element abundances hinges on some depletion of @xmath0li in old halo stars ( burles , nollett , & turner 2000 ) , although in our view a clear answer is still precluded . for this reason we will investigate the effect of adopting three different values for the primordial lithium abundance in the chemical evolution code .

    "the remaining unexplained fraction of the solar abundance has to originate from a stellar source .",
    "different studies trying to explain the observed log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) vs. [ fe / h ] trend by taking into account different astrophysical sites for @xmath0li production have appeared in the literature ( _ e.g. _ , dantona & matteucci 1991 ; matteucci , dantona , & timmes 1995 ; abia , isern , & canal 1995 ; romano et al .",

    "we describe the chemical evolution model and the various lithium producers . in section 3",
    "the results are presented and in section 4 some conclusions are drawn .",

    "2001 ) .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to form out of two main episodes of accretion : during the first one the halo / thick - disk forms ; during the second one the thin - disk is built up , mainly out of matter of primordial chemical composition , except for some fraction of enriched gas from the halo .",
    "the stellar generations forming during the galactic lifetime distribute their stellar masses according to a scalo initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the imf is kept constant in space and time .",
    "the star formation , proportional to both the gas surface density and the total mass surface density at every time , is a self - regulated process , in the sense that it stops when the gas surface density falls below a certain critical threshold and it starts again when an above - threshold value is recovered due to infall of primordial matter coupled to restoration of gaseous matter by dying stars .",
    "as far as the solar vicinity is concerned , the major differences with the chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) model which we adopted in paper i are the following : the sun is located at a distance of 8 kpc from the galactic center , rather than 10 kpc ; the adopted galactic age is 14 gyr , rather than 15 gyr ; the timescales for mass accretion in the halo / thick - disk and thin - disk components are 0.8 and 7 gyr , respectively ( rather than 2 and 8 gyr ) .",
    "we refer the reader to chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2001 ) for a full description of model parameters and results . here",
    "we will only address the aspects more strictly related to @xmath0li evolution ( production in different astrophysical environments and astration in stars ) .",
    "the primordial @xmath0li abundance is set to be log@xmath2(@xmath0li)@xmath13 = 2.2 dex ( bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) . the cases log@xmath2(@xmath0li)@xmath13 = 2.09 dex ( ryan et al . 2000 ) and 2.4 dex ( _ e.g. _ , pinsonneault et al .",

    "lithium astration in stars of all masses is taken into account in a simple way , by assuming that each stellar generation fully destroyes the lithium present in the progenitor gas out of which it forms .",
    "as far as the @xmath0li synthesis is concerned , we include in the chemical evolution code the following @xmath0li sources : the @xmath14-process in type ii supernovae ( sne ) , agb stars which undergo the hot bottom burning ( hbb ) process , low - mass red giants , novae , and gcrs .",
    "moreover , we try to argue whether low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) could play a role regarding the production of @xmath1li at a galactic scale .",
    "the hypothesis of instantaneous recycling is relaxed and the stellar lifetimes are taken into account in great detail : according to this , different lithium sources restore their newly synthesized @xmath0li on different timescales .",
    "this is an important point to stress , since the shape of the growth in the log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) vs. [ fe / h ] diagram can be justified just in terms of timescales of @xmath0li production .",
    "the neutrino flux emitted from a cooling proto - neutron star alters the traditional outcome of explosive nucleosynthesis from type ii sne .",
    "@xmath0li production takes place mostly in the helium shell .",
    "the key reaction for producing @xmath0li is the excitation of @xmath15he by @xmath16- and @xmath17-neutrinos ( and their anti - neutrinos ) through inelastic scattering , followed by nuclear de - excitation via emission of a neutron or a proton .",
    "the decay products then react with the abundant @xmath15he to produce @xmath0li and @xmath0be ( which decays later to @xmath0li ) ( see hartmann et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , no observational evidence exists supporting that type ii sne are able to enrich the ism in @xmath0li .",
    "therefore , the estimated theoretical yields are very uncertain . in particular , they are mostly sensitive to the properties of the neutrino flux .",
    "@xmath14-process yields for a model grid in stellar mass and metallicity have been computed by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "we included @xmath0li + @xmath0be yields from woosley & weaver in a model for the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and showed that , in order to reproduce the extension of the lithium - metallicity plateau , we had to require a reduction of these yields by at least a factor of 2 ( paper i ) .",
    "our claim was in agreement with the upper limit on the contribution to @xmath0li production by @xmath14-induced nucleosynthesis suggested by ramaty et al .",
    "moreover , observations of be and b in stars covering 3 orders of magnitude in metallicity ( @xmath43.0 @xmath18 [ fe / h ] @xmath18 @xmath190.0 ) suggest a scenario for light element production which argues against the majority of b being produced in the @xmath14-process ( duncan et al .",

    "@xmath20      agb stars have been recognized to be @xmath0li producers since long ago ( smith & lambert 1989 , 1990 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) . according to sackmann & boothroyd",
    ", @xmath0li production would occur in the mass range @xmath21 @xmath10 46 @xmath22 , when the temperature at the base of the convective envelope exceeds 50 @xmath23 10@xmath9 k and the @xmath0be transport mechanism ( cameron & fowler 1971 ) works . under these conditions , @xmath0li abundances as large as log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) @xmath10 44.5 can be achieved in the external layers , in principle allowing these stars to efficiently pollute the ism via mass loss and/or planetary nebula ( pn ) ejection .",
    "a metallicity effect would also prevent these stars from contributing significant amounts of newly synthesized @xmath0li at early times ( plez , smith , & lambert 1993 ; see also discussions in matteucci et al .",
    "1995 and paper i ) , thus helping to keep the lithium - metallicity plateau flat until an ism metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath40.5 dex is achieved , in agreement with observations ( fig .",
    "[ figdat ] ) . on these grounds ,",
    "massive agbs were proposed as a significant source of lithium galactic enrichment ( _ e.g. _ , dantona & matteucci 1991 ; matteucci et al .",
    "1995 ) , even if a reliable computation of the @xmath0li yields was still in demand at that time .",
    "very recently such a computational task has been accomplished by means of the code aton 2.0 ( ventura et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this computational tool is especially devised to follow the agb hbb phase : it includes diffusive mixing coupled to nuclear evolution and it treats turbulence in the full spectrum of turbulence model ( canuto & mazzitelli 1991 ; canuto , goldman & mazzitelli 1996 ) .",
    "results for @xmath24 = 0.01 can be found in ventura et al .",
    "here we enlarge the model grid to a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath24 = 0.0002 , 0.0006 , 0.001 , 0.004 , and 0.02 ) and include it in a code for the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood .",

    "2000 ) .",
    "lithium production during the agb phase is very efficient , but in the last phases of evolution the fast @xmath26he consumption implies a soon decrease in the @xmath0li abundance . as a result ,",
    "the net yields are too low to significantly contribute to @xmath0li enrichment on a galactic scale ( see section 3 for detailed chemical evolution results ) .",
    "population i red giants usually have lithium abundances lying in the range @xmath41 @xmath27 log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) @xmath27 1 ( lambert , dominy , & sivertsen 1980 ; brown et al .",

    "interestingly enough , these li - rich giants have not yet reached the agb , and at least some of them are observed to be low - mass stars ; thus they can not have experienced @xmath0li creation via hbb , and do not enter in the group we have analyzed in detail in the previous paragraphs .",
    "a scenario has been proposed in which all low - mass giants ( @xmath21 @xmath27 2.5 @xmath22 ) suffer a prompt @xmath0li enrichment in the upper part of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , after the first dredge - up and before the rgb tip .",

    "( 2000 ) have explored the possibility of @xmath0li enrichment by low - mass , metal - poor rgb stars in globular clusters and suggested them as a potential source of @xmath0li enrichment in the galactic disk .",
    "maybe the best mechanism for producing the @xmath0li photospheric enrichment for these low - mass giants is the cool bottom process ( cbp ) based on @xmath0be production from @xmath26he in the h - burning shell , followed by transport of the fresh @xmath0be up to the base of the convective layer to be then taken to the cooler stellar surface where it decays to @xmath0li ( sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a discontinuous @xmath0li enrichment is linked to mass loss , and the process can be repeated depending on the availability of @xmath26he .",
    "contrary to agb stars , where @xmath0be is quickly mixed away by ordinary convection , in rgb stars some extra - mixing is required .",
    "denissenkov & weiss ( 2000 ) have proposed a mechanism which is able to trigger the extra - mixing : a giant planet ( or brown dwarf ) is engulfed by a red giant ; this external event activates inside the giant the @xmath0be transport mechanism which results in producing @xmath0li .",
    "the great advantage of this solution is that it can account not only for the li - production but also for the subsequent li - depletion , on a quick timescale consistent with the results of de la reza et al .",
    "the amount of @xmath0li produced in a single episode of lithium enrichment can exceed log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) @xmath10 4 , but it is critically related to the details of the extra - mixing mechanism ( sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath0li injected into the ism depends strongly on the parameters of the lithium enrichment scenario : the size and timescales of the lithium enhancements , the magnitude and timescales of the mass loss , and whether , how often , and at what points on the rgb such enhancement episodes occur",

    "however , if at least some @xmath0li enrichment episodes occur near the tip of the rgb , this average @xmath0li abundance could be more than an order of magnitude larger , yielding to a non - negligible @xmath0li enrichment of the ism ( sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ; but see also charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ) .    here we investigate this latter scenario , more favourable to @xmath0li production .",
    "we assume that : _",
    "i ) _ all stars in the mass range @xmath21 = 12 @xmath22 experience enhanced rgb lithium abundances in conjunction with episodic mass loss , for a period lasting @xmath10 10@xmath0 yr on the whole ( whatever the timescale of a single lithium enhancement episode and the recurrence of the phenomenon may be ) ; _ ii ) _ the photospheric @xmath0li enrichment occurs near the tip of the rgb , so that the mass loss is at work at the highest rates ( @xmath10 10@xmath29 @xmath22 yr@xmath31 ) ; _ iii ) _ the surface lithium abundance is set to log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) = 4 for each star .",

    "i ) _ the nova system formation rate at any time @xmath33 is a constant fraction of the wd formation rate at a previous time @xmath34 ( dantona & matteucci 1991 ) ; this constant fraction is fixed by the rate of nova outbursts observed in the galaxy at the present time ( 2030 yr@xmath31 , shafter 1997 ) ; _ ii ) _ the value of @xmath35 is set in order to guarantee the cooling of the wd at a level that ensures a strong enough nova burst ; _ iii ) _",

    "1986 ) ; _ iv ) _ 30% of novae occur in systems containing onemg wds , while the remaining 70% occur in systems containing co wds ( _ e.g. _ , gehrz et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "in this study we will adopt the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions on lithium production from nova outbursts we used in paper i. besides , we will investigate in more detail how tightly our results are bound to the assumptions we made .",
    "@xmath0li is also produced in spallation and fusion processes associated with cosmic rays ( _ e.g. _ , reeves et al .",
    "1970 ; meneguzzi et al .",
    "1971 ) .",
    "a gcr production of @xmath0li at early times could complicate the derivation of the primordial @xmath0li abundance from population ii star data also under the simplifying hypothesis that @xmath0li depletion in halo stars is negligible . in principle , by using information on be and @xmath9li one can set an upper bound to the fraction of @xmath0li produced by gcrs in the halo phase , in the context of a given model of gcr nucleosynthesis ( see olive & fields 1999 and refs .",
    "therein ) . however , theoretical predictions are very uncertain , since they depend on the details of the cosmic ray sources and propagation , which are still poorly known . at epochs when [ fe / h ] exceeds about @xmath41 dex , nucleosynthesis in a variety of other galactic objects ( see previous paragraphs ) produce the bulk of @xmath0li .",
    "in particular , gcrs are expected to contribute no more than 25% of the meteoritic @xmath0li abundance ( see arguments in reeves 1993 ) .    in this work",

    "there are three main scenarios for the formation of these x - ray transients : _",
    "i ) _ initially , the system is a wide binary composed of a very massive primary and a solar - type secondary .",

    "however , it should be noted that each neutron star sxt would actually eject li at a rate about an order of magnitude lower .",

    "this formula accounts for any mass loss by winds prior to the ejection of the pn . the abundance of @xmath0li in the ejected material was assumed to be log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) = 3.5 dex , fairly lower than the value suggested by matteucci et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( 4.15 dex ) . in both models",
    "@xmath0li production in agb stars takes place only at metallicities @xmath24 @xmath39 10@xmath40 .",
    "when the thermally pulsing agb phase is followed by means of self - consistent stellar evolutionary tracks and mass loss is taken into account in a detailed way , more reliable @xmath0li yields can be obtained .",
    "chemical evolution results produced by using the model grid of table  [ tabyields ] for a value of the reimer s parameter of mass loss @xmath25 = 0.10 are very similar to those obtained with our old prescriptions ( _ cf .",
    "_ models labelled _ paper i _ and _ @xmath25 = 0.10 _ ) .",
    "on the other hand , the choice @xmath25 = 0.01 results in a significantly lower @xmath0li production from agbs .",
    "a value of @xmath25 = 0.01 seems to be the preferred one in order to explain some important stellar observational properties ( ventura et al . 2000 ) ; hence we conclude that @xmath0li production from agb stars should be negligible and nearly undistinguishable from a situation where only astration is acting and no astrophysical sites for lithium production are turned on ( model labelled _ astration _ in fig .",
    "[ figagb ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figdif ] we show the @xmath0li abundance evolution that would be predicted by taking into account only a single category of stellar @xmath0li producers ( type ii sne , agb stars , novae , and low - mass giants ) , and compare it to the observational data .",
    "lithium synthesis prescriptions for each class of sources are those given in section 2.2 .",
    "the sudden increase in log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) at [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath40.5 pointed out by the data requires important production at galactic ages larger than @xmath10 2.5 gyr , so that a low - mass stellar component must enter in the model .",
    "it is immediately seen how novae and low - mass giants , contributing to @xmath0li enrichment on longer timescales than the other sources , are the best candidates for explaining this late , sudden rise from the lithium - metallicity plateau . as far as the low - mass giants are concerned , the delayed lithium production is essentially due to the long lifetimes of their progenitors whereas , when considering novae , the late lithium enrichment is partly due to the addition of a suitable cooling time to the lifetime of the wd progenitor , which allows the newly formed wd to cool at a level that ensures strong enough nova outbursts .",
    "we checked the model behaviour under different assumptions on the value of the cooling time , and found that no relevant changes in the results are produced for values lying in the range @xmath35 @xmath10 12 gyr . similarly , changing the fraction of the wds that enter the formation of new nova systems at every time ( anyway keeping it always constant over the time ) , so that the range of values of the present time nova outburst rate as inferred from observations can be reproduced , does not seriously affect the results . in conclusion , as far as the nova contribution is concerned , the major uncertainties reside in the nucleosynthesis computations and in the number of outbursts experienced by the typical nova system .",
    "given the low percentage of low - mass li - rich stars observed in the galaxy , we did not considered low - mass giants as @xmath0li producers in paper i. however , both observational and theoretical evidence has grown suggesting that this particular category of stars could eventually represent a non - negligible @xmath0li factory on a galactic scale ( see section 2.2.3 ) .",
    "therefore , we include now in the code @xmath0li production from low - mass giants as well .",
    "we find that a significant contribution from these stellar sources is achieved only under very restrictive hypotheses on the parameters of the lithium enhancement : lithium enhancement has to last for a period of @xmath10 10@xmath0 yr ; moreover , the enhancement has to occur in conjunction with strong mass loss rates .",
    "this latter requirement can be easily satisfied if lithium enrichment occurs near the tip of the rgb .",
    "@xmath41    1 @xmath18 @xmath42 @xmath18 2 .      by taking into account all the stellar @xmath0li producers seen above in the chemical evolution model , we are able to explain the steep rise from the lithium - metallicity plateau , but we still fail to achieve the meteoritic abundance of @xmath0li ( fig",
    ".  [ figbest ] , dashed line ) .",
    "our best - model includes the contributions from type ii sne , agb stars , low - mass giants , novae and gcrs ( fig .",
    "[ figbest ] , continuous line ) . adding the contribution from lmxbs",
    "practically does not change the result ( fig .",
    "[ figbest ] , dotted line ) .",
    "this is against lmxbs being considered lithium producers on a galactic scale , although no firm conclusions can be drawn , given the uncertainties involved when dealing with these systems .",
    "however , we would like to stress that we adopted here a series of prescriptions aiming at maximizing the role of lmxbs in enriching the ism with li , at least in the framework of our present knowledge of these systems ( see section 2.2.6 ) .",
    "in table  [ metabund ] we list the contribution ( in % ) to the meteoritic abundance from each source in the framework of our best - model .",
    "the joint contributions from type ii sne , agbs , and gcrs are able to explain @xmath10 35% of the meteoritic @xmath0li abundance .",
    "the remainder should be produced by long living sources , which we identify with novae and low - mass giants .",
    "however , the relative importance of their contributions is very uncertain .",
    "we tentatively ascribe @xmath10 20% of the meteoritic lithium to nova production and @xmath10 40% to low - mass giants , on the ground of current knowledge of nova nucleosynthesis and current ( un)knowledge of @xmath0li synthesis along the rgb in low - mass stars .",
    "finally , we compare our best - model with other two models which share with it the same prescriptions on @xmath0li production , but start from different values of the primordial lithium abundance ( fig .",
    "[ figprim ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that model results are nearly the same for metallicities greater than [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath40.5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that stellar astration acting during the galaxy evolution strongly reduces the primordial @xmath0li abundance in the ism already after @xmath10 2.5 gyr from the beginning of the galaxy formation @xmath10 @xmath40.5 is gained at @xmath33 @xmath10 2.5 gyr . ] . for @xmath33",
    "@xmath39 2.5 gyr only a small fraction of the observed @xmath0li has a primordial origin , since at that time most of the ism @xmath0li abundance is due to stellar production .",
    "* in agreement with our previous results ( paper i ) we confirm that novae are necessary in order to reproduce the @xmath0li abundance evolution traced out by the upper envelope of the observational data ; in particular , they can reproduce the steep rise of the lithium abundance for [ fe / h ] @xmath43 @xmath40.5 dex . *",
    "new stellar yields of @xmath0li from agb stars have been included in the code for the chemical evolution of the galaxy . as a result",
    ", we find that agb stars can not be considered as a significant source of @xmath0li in the galaxy . * low - mass giant stars , restoring their processed material on long timescales ,",
    "are among the best candidates ( together with novae ) for reproducing the late rise from the lithium - metallicity plateau .",
    "recent theoretical computations ( sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ) suggest that they could indeed contribute a non - negligible fraction of the interstellar @xmath0li , and this is confirmed by our model results .",
    "however , it should be cautioned that in order to reproduce the observed log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) vs. [ fe / h ] trend we have to make very restrictive hypotheses on the parameters of the lithium enhancement in low - mass rgb stars . * as far as the lmxbs are concerned , we conclude that they contribute negligibly to the amount of lithium in the galaxy . *",
    "the temporal evolution of the @xmath0li abundance in the disk is almost independent of the value of the primordial abundance we choose . on the contrary , the evolutionary scenario in the halo",
    "is deeply bound to the choice of this value .",
    "* our best - model predicts an increase in the ism @xmath0li content over the last 4.5 gyr . at first glance , this seems to be in disagreement with recent observations both of ttauri stars ( stout - batalha et al .",
    "2000 ) and in the orion association ( cunha , smith , & lambert 1995 ) . however , as far as the orion stars are concerned , there are arguments for accommodating a @xmath0li abundance near - solar even if the galactic disk @xmath0li abundances are increasing ( cunha et al .",
    "1995 ) : in particular , the fact that the mean [ li / fe ] for the orion stars is roughly 0.0 to @xmath40.1 , and therefore not very far from the meteoritic value , would be indicative of the fact that the @xmath0li content measured in the orion association should not be compared to our results for the @xmath0li abundance in the ism at the present time , but with those referring to 4.5 gyr ago .",
    "finally , we would like to recall the reader that all our computations have been carried out under the assumption that the stars tracing the upper envelope of the log@xmath2(@xmath0li ) vs. [ fe / h ] diagram have not had their original lithium abundance altered by any process of dilution and/or depletion .",
