    "predicting structural and thermodynamic properties of charged colloidal suspensions is a difficult task @xcite . at the simplest level of description ,",
    "the solvent is treated as a continuous medium of fixed dielectric permittivity and one discards correlation effects that prevail , as a rule of thumb , for multivalent micro - ions and sufficiently charged colloids @xcite . viewing the microionic fluid as an inhomogeneous ideal gas leads to the poison - boltzmann theory .",
    "however , as such , it does not easily lend itself to numerical investigations @xcite , not to mention analytical progress . in practice , this mean - field theory often needs a further mean - field - like reduction , to predict quantities that can be compared to experiments or simulations , such as osmotic pressures .",
    "one successful and popular such simplification is the so - called cell model , where an @xmath0-body colloidal situation is mapped onto a one body problem , placed at the center of a wigner - seitz cell @xcite .",
    "this cell is often taken spherical for simplicity , with a volume equal to the mean volume per colloid . as an alternative to the cell picture ,",

    "our goal here is three - fold .",
    "first , we present in section [ sec : method ] the main ingredients of the jellium model , together with a new procedure that allows to solve the problem self - consistently for mixtures , in a more efficient way than hitherto proposed .",
    "compared to the method used in refs @xcite for monodisperse colloids , an elegant reformulation was reported in @xcite , that significantly speeds up the resolution .",
    "we shall argue that this reformulation looses its suitability when dealing with mixtures .",
    "second , we discuss in section [ sec : results ] some of the main features of effective charges as emerging within the jellium approach . yet",
    ", such quantities , interesting in their own right , can be coined as secondary , in the sense that they are often not directly measured in an experiment or in a simulation .",
    "we therefore implement monte carlo simulations of a binary charged mixture , which provide an important benchmark against which the polydisperse cell and the jellium schemes can be confronted .",
    "our simulations , at the level of the primitive model , do not rely an any mean - field hypothesis , and treat exactly the coulombic nature of the interactions between all species ( colloids and micro - ions ) .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "for the following discussion , it seems appropriate to revisit briefly an aspect of the common phenomenology of cell and jellium effective charges . for highly charged colloids [ yet in the mean - field regime , where a poisson - boltzmann description may hold ] ,",
    "the strong interactions between the colloids and the micro - ions induce an accumulation of the latter in the vicinity of the colloids .",
    "this in turn induces a renormalization of the colloidal effective charge @xcite .",
    "if the colloidal bare charge @xmath1 is large , the effective charge become independent of @xmath1 ; this is the saturation phenomenon @xcite , a signature of mean - field , where the effective charge becomes @xmath2 , which only depends on the density and salt content . for a reason to become clear below , in the no salt case , @xmath2 as a function of density ( or volume fraction @xmath3 )",

    "however , further increasing @xmath3 , @xmath2 starts to increases : this can be viewed as an indirect effect of screening .",
    "the micro - ions efficiently screen their own interactions with the colloids , so that electrostatic binding is weakened .",
    "this dichotomy between the entropy dominated and the energy dominated regimes will be met again below , where it induces a non - trivial dependence on mixture composition .",
    "we consider an arbitrary mixture of positively charged spherical colloids , where each species is indexed by an integer @xmath7 .",

    "the starting point of the jellium model is the same as the celebrated poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite , with an additional assumption , that allows to restrict the problem to a single colloid formulation ( the cell model approach also aims at a similar restriction , but proceeds very differently @xcite ) .",
    "the key point in the jellium approach is that the charge of other colloids around a given tagged macroion is smeared out to form a homogeneous background of charge density @xmath15 , in which the small ions are then immersed .",
    "a self - consistency requirement connects this background charge with the effective charge of the various species , see refs @xcite for more details .",
    "we denote the bjerrum length by @xmath16 , and we restrict for the sake of the argument to salt free systems ( see subsection [ ssec : salt ] for the general case ) .",

    "we have proposed a novel procedure for solving jellium - like models , taking due account of renormalization effects .",
    "such approaches had been tested with some success on liposome and latex dispersions @xcite .",
    "particular emphasis was put on colloidal mixtures , where it was shown that the computationally most demanding part of the task boils down to a sequence of mono - component calculations .",
    "the idea was illustrated on binary mixtures , but can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary polydispersities , including continuous case after suitable discretization .",
    "the method takes advantage of the mean - field nature of the theory , where all species considered obey the same poisson equation , with different boundary conditions , in a background density that couples all constituents of the mixture .    in a second step ,",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations of binary mixtures , at primitive model level : the solvent is viewed as a dielectric continuum , but otherwise , coulombic interactions are treated exactly .",
    "this allows to assess the accuracy of mean - field simplifications . in this respect , we tested the jellium predictions for the osmotic pressure and those of the poisson - boltzmann cell , against monte carlo",
    ". it was know that in the monocomponent case , both mean - field approaches yield very close results , that fare very favorably against mc , provided of course one remains in the regime of relatively weak couplings where poisson - boltzmann theory may hold .",
    "we have shown here that despite the different nature of the jellium and poisson - boltzmann cell approximations , both approaches continue to give similar results , close to mc , in the case of binary mixtures of spherical colloids .    finally , while the method was illustrated on the simplest implementation of the jellium view , refinements and generalizations along the lines proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite can also be addressed .",
    "it is also of interest to extend our approach to colloidal objects of non spherical shapes .",

    "the bottom curve with @xmath185 exhibits a saturation value below 8 for @xmath186 , which should also set the upper possible limit for @xmath75 , since the two species are of the same size in that example .",
