    "the luminosity of these galaxies typically reach @xmath7 erg / sec . in general",
    ", agns refers to these bright centers .",
    "it is hypothesized that the existence of a supermassive black hole @xmath8 [ here @xmath9 is solar mass ; @xmath10 g ] may explain the observed brightness as this supermassive blackhole captures the matter around it through accretion .",
    "this supermassive blackhole is hypothesized to be formed by the collapse of a cluster of stars . during and after accretion , accelerated protons may collide with other protons and/or with the ambient photon field present in the vicinity of an agn or / and in the associated jets ( see latter in this sect . ) and produce unstable hadrons .",
    "these unstable hadrons decay mainly into neutral and charged pions . the neutral pions decay into photons and",
    "thus may explain the observed brightness whereas the charged pions mainly decay into electron and muon neutrinos and corresponding antineutrinos .",
    "for an update review of various flux estimates for @xmath3 and @xmath4 from agns ( as well as from some other interesting astrophysical sources ) , see @xcite . the same protons ( hypothesized to be present in the vicinity of an agn ) and photons may give rise to @xmath0 ( and @xmath11 ) in a small number , through , for instance , @xmath12 .",
    "it is so because the production cross for @xmath13 is essentially two orders of magnitude lower than , for instance , that of @xmath14 ( a main source of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) for the relevant center of mass energy scale .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath15 to decay eventually into @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) is approximately an order of magnitude lower than for @xmath14 to decay into @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these two suppression factors alongwith the relevant kinematic limits give approximately the ratio of fluxes of tau neutrinos and muon ( anti ) neutrinos as @xmath16 @xcite .    here",
    ", we discuss a possibility to enhance this ratio , that is , to obtain , @xmath17 , through neutrino spin - flip induced by violation of equivalence principle ( vep ) @xcite .",
    "the vep arises as different flavours of neutrinos may couple differently to gravity @xcite .",
    "this essentially results from the realization that flavour eigenstates of neutrinos may be the admixture of the gravity eigenstates of neutrinos with different gravitational couplings .",
    "we study here mainly the spin - flip for majorana type neutrinos in the vicinity of the cores of active galaxies which we hereafter refer to as agns . some agns give off a jet of matter that stream out from the nucleus in a transverse plane and produces hot spots when the jet strikes the surrounding matter at its other end . for a discussion of neutrino spin - flip in jets and hot spots ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "previously , the neutrino spin - flip effects for agn neutrinos due to vep are studied in @xcite .",
    "the vep is parameterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 . in @xcite , by demanding an adiabatic conversion to occur , a lower bound on @xmath6 was obtained in terms of @xmath18 . in @xcite , neutrino spin - flip in agn due to gravitational effects ( based on a certain choice of the metric parameters ) and due to the presence of a large magnetic field",
    "is studied , whereas in @xcite , the effect of possible random fluctuation in @xmath1 on neutrino precession is considered .",
    "there is no detailed study of the implications of spin - flip effects for neutrinos with small @xmath19 originating from agn without gravitational effects and/or vep . in this context , here we address two different aspects of spin - flip for high energy neutrinos , viz , the spin ( flavour)-precession with / without vep in @xmath1 ; and the adiabatic / nonadiabatic conversion due to an interplay of @xmath1 and the vep .",
    "we point out that , for latter type of conversion effect , a @xmath18 of the order of @xmath20 depending on @xmath19 gives reasonably large conversion probabilities for a suitable choice of parameters of the agn model .",
    "the present study is particularly welcome as the new ice / underwater erenkov light detectors namely amanda , baikal , nestor and antares will have not only the energy but also the angle and flavour resolutions for high energy neutrinos from agns @xcite .",
    "these characteristics make these neutrino telescopes especially suitable for the study of various high energy neutrino conversions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we briefly discuss the matter density and magnetic field profiles in agn . in sect .",
    "3 , we discuss the spin ( flavour)-precession due to vep and determine the value of @xmath18 needed to have the precession probability greater than 1/2 .",
    "in the same sect . , we consider in some detail the resonant / nonresonant conversions induced by an interplay of @xmath1 , and the vep alongwith corresponding observational consequences and finally in sect .",
    "4 , we summarize our results .",
    "neutrino spin - precession in the context of the sun was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the matter effects tend to suppress the precession effect .",
    "as shown below , for agn , matter effects arising due to coherent forward scattering of neutrinos off the background are negligible ( similar estimate for other astrophysical systems like sun and collapsing stars shows that the matter effects are indeed nonnegligible in most part of these systems ) .",
    "the essential conditions needed for appreciable spin - precession are : i ) @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 must be large enough in the region @xmath23 ; ii ) the smallness of the usual matter effects , so that neutrino spin - precession is not suppressed ( see below ) ; and iii ) there should be no reverse spin - precession of neutrinos on their way to earth . as for the third essential condition the observed intergalactic magnetic field for the nearby galaxies",
    "is estimated to be @xmath24 g ) at a scale of mpc . taking a typical distance between the earth and the agn as @xmath25100 mpc",
    ", we note that the effect induced by intergalactic / galactic magnetic field is quite small as the galactic magnetic field is @xmath26 g ) , thus causing negligible reverse spin - precession .",
    "according to @xcite , the matter density in the vicinity of agn has the following profile : @xmath27 where @xmath28 g/@xmath29 and @xmath30 as we take the agn luminosity to be @xmath31 erg / sec with @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the schwarzchild radius of agn : @xmath34 m. we take the distance traversed by the neutrinos to be @xmath35 in the vicinity of agn .",
    "these imply that the width of the matter traversed by neutrinos in the vicinity of the agn is @xmath36 g/@xmath37 . in the presence of matter ,",
    "the effective width of matter needed for appreciable spin - flip , on the other hand , is @xmath38 g/@xmath39 , much larger than @xmath40 .",
    "hence , from now on , we ignore the matter effects .",
    "we consider now the magnetic field in the vicinity of agn with the following profile @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 g and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "we will use this @xmath1 in our estimates .",
    "the evolution equation for the two neutrino state for vanishing gravity mixing angle and the vanishing vacuum mixing angle is governed by an effective hamiltonian whose diagonal elements may be written as @xcite @xmath45 in eq .",

    "evidently , this @xmath66 is independent of @xmath48 .",

    "for instance , consider @xmath88 ev@xmath70 relevant for atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "the result of vacuum oscillations with non vanishing vacuum mixing angle is a modification in the @xmath56 and @xmath11 spectra through @xmath89 or a modification in @xmath4 and @xmath0 spectra through @xmath90 , whereas the magnetic moment effects give rise to changes in @xmath4 and @xmath11 spectra or in @xmath56 and @xmath0 spectra .",
    "this simply follows from the fact that a majorana type neutrino magnetic moment causes a precession between the relevant neutrino states of opposite helicity as well as flavour in an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , an empirical _ distinction _ between high energy @xmath4 and @xmath56 spectra as well as between high energy @xmath0 and @xmath11 spectra , if observed , will be an evidence for the magnetic moments effects here .",
    "the situation of @xmath91 may be realized by replacing @xmath56 by @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) with the corresponding @xmath19 .",
    "a relevant remark is in order here : the deficit measured by superkamiokande in atmospheric muon neutrino flux may currently be explained either through @xmath90 or through @xmath93 . for high energy neutrinos originating from agns , in the case of @xmath90 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath94 is close to 1/2 as we take the @xmath19 and the vacuum mixing angle suggested by recent superkamiokande data .",
    "therefore , a ratio of @xmath94 different from @xmath951/2 correlated to the direction of source may here provide an evidence for neutrino spin - flip in the agn environment . even for @xmath96 , a mutual comparison of relevant high energy neutrino flux spectra from various neutrino telescopes",
    "may be needed to unambiguisly identify the cause of high energy neutrino conversions . in case of @xmath97 ,",
    "a measured ratio of @xmath98 may provide the corresponding evidence thus constituting an observational signature with relatively large @xmath19 ( @xmath99 ev@xmath70 ) for high energy neutrinos originating from agns .",
    "this follows from the realization that the existing / future high energy neutrino telescopes may measure the ratio @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "let us note that all these spin ( flavour)-precession situations may be realized without vep .",
    "in the previous studies @xcite on spin - flip effects for agn neutrinos , the possible cause for distortions in the relevant neutrino spectra was attributed to either nonzero @xmath18 or strong gravitational effects . however , as we have noticed a spin ( flavour)-precession for agn neutrinos may develop even without vep or / and strong gravitational effects .",
    "thus , the cause of change ( as compared to no precession situation ) in the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath56 fluxes , @xmath101 , in existing / future high energy neutrino telescopes may not only be attributed to vep and/or gravitational effects particularly if an almost energy independent permutation for @xmath56 and @xmath0 neutrino spectra takes place for small @xmath19 with large relevant precession probability .",
    "if @xmath6 is of majorana type then eq .",
    "( 4 ) gives an excess of @xmath0 as compared to @xmath56 in case of a complete permutation as the estimated initial flux of @xmath0 is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand the ratio between the @xmath3 and @xmath56 fluxes is at most just a factor of 2 .",
    "let us note that this situation , if realized empirically will provide an evidence for a violation of total lepton number by two units .",
    "conversely , if @xmath5 is of dirac type then a deficit in an otherwise large @xmath56 flux is expected since now the precessed neutrino state is a sterile one .",
    "the sterile neutrinos do not interact weakly and therefore are accounted for by the disappearance / appearance of the relevant active neutrino ( @xmath56 ) flux .",
    "if the precessions are incomplete ( as compared to complete permutations ) , the resulting high energy neutrino spectra are expected to be rather complicated combinations of the two neutrino species involved in the precession .",
    "* case 2 . * @xmath102 ( with small @xmath58 , that is , @xmath103 ) . for constant @xmath49",

    "( 4 ) the relevant precession probability expression by replacing @xmath104 with @xmath49 . if @xmath105 then using eq .",
    "( 1 ) and eq . ( 3 ) , we obtain @xmath106 .",
    "we take here @xmath107 as our criteria and so consequently the corresponding @xmath66 reduces to ( 5 ) .",
    "this results in @xmath108 with no energy dependence .",
    "thus this case coincides with case 1a ) for small @xmath109 depending on the given @xmath1 profile .",
    "consequently , if there is a violation of equivalence principle at the level of @xmath110 or less , a spin ( flavour)-precession for neutrinos may occur in the vicinity of agn with small @xmath19 . evidently , this value of @xmath18 is independent of the gravity mixing angle @xcite . for @xmath111 , energy dependence in @xmath66 results with @xmath84 . for large @xmath65 ( @xmath112 )",
    "see next case and if @xmath113 then this case reduces to 1c ) .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath18 obtained in this case has only a linear energy dependence , whereas the other necessary requirement [ eq .",
    "( 6 ) ] does not depend on @xmath48 for small @xmath58 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation discussed in next case , where both the level crossing as well as the adiabaticity conditions depend on @xmath48 .",
    "thus , to summarize , we have pointed out in this case that for high energy neutrinos originating from agn , a spin ( flavour)-precession may develop in the vicinity of agn if @xmath114 and for a reasonable choice of other parameters of the agn model yielding @xmath115 .",
    "* @xmath116 .",
    "this results in conversion effect in contrast to the previously considered two cases [ which are spin ( flavour)-precession effects ] .",
    "two conditions are essential for an adiabatic conversion : i ) level crossing and ii ) adiabaticity .",
    "the level crossing is obtained by equating the diagonal elements of the effective haliltonain in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , that is , @xmath117 .",
    "the level crossing for @xmath1181 pev implies @xmath119 note that relative sign between @xmath65 and @xmath49 is important for level crossing . from the level crossing",
    "it follows that @xmath120 , i.e. , an inverse quadratic @xmath48 dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "this level crossing is induced by an interplay of magnetic field and vep . however ,",
    "level crossing alone is not a sufficient condition for a complete conversion .",
    "as stated earlier , adiabaticity is the other necessary condition that determines the extent of conversion .",
    "if there is only level crossing and no adiabaticity at the level crossing then there is no conversion of antimuon neutrinos into tau ( sterile ) neutrinos .",
    "the relevant adiabaticity condition may be written as @xmath121 we note that @xmath122 for 10@xmath123100 with @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the adiabatic conversion may occur giving rise to energy dependent distortions with corresponding conversion probability greater than 1/2 . for large @xmath65 whereas a spin ( flavour)-precession is suppressed [ see case 1b ) and 1c ) ] , an adiabatic conversion may result with @xmath108 for large @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . let us emphasize that this adiabatic level crossing is induced by the change in the gravitational potential rather than the change in effective matter density .",
    "thus , observationally , we may obtain here @xmath125 due to an adiabatic conversion induced by an interplay of @xmath49 and @xmath1 in the vicinity of the agn .",
    "for @xmath126 this case reduces to case 2 whereas for @xmath113 , we obtain case 1c ) .",
    "it follows from the discussion in case 3 that a _ nonzero _ @xmath18 is needed to induce an adiabatic level crossing with @xmath108 .",
    "it is in contrast to cases 1 and 2 where a spin - flip may occur through spin ( flavour)-precession without @xmath18 with @xmath108 .",
    "the initial fluxes of the high energy neutrinos originating from agn are estimated to have the following ratios : @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "thus , if an enhanced @xmath129 ratio ( as compared to no precession / conversion situation ) is observed correlated to the direction of source for high energy neutrinos , then it may be either an evidence for a spin - flip through spin ( flavour)-precession alone or through a resonant conversion in the vicinity of agn due to an interplay of vep and @xmath1 depending on the finer details of the relevant high energy agn neutrino spectra .",
    "the spin ( flavour)-precession and/or conversion effects discussed in this study may be distinguished by observing the energy dependence of the high energy neutrino flux profiles . a mutual comparison of the relevant ( that is ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath0 ) high energy neutrino spectra may in principle isolate the mechanism of neutrino conversions in the vicinity of agn .",
    "\\2 . for small @xmath19 ( @xmath130 ev@xmath70 ) a spin",
    "( flavour)-precession may result in an energy independent permutation of the relevant neutrino spectra with the corresponding spin ( flavour)-precession probability greater than 1/2 .",
    "this spin ( flavour)-precession may occur for small @xmath18 ( @xmath131 ) . the spin - flip may occur through resonant conversions induced by the vep and @xmath1 as well .",
    "assuming that the information on @xmath18 may be obtained from various terrestial / extraterrestial experiments , a mutual comparison between the survived and transformed high energy agn neutrinos may enable one to distinguish the mechanism of conversion .",
    "if for small @xmath19 ( @xmath132 ev@xmath70 ) , an energy dependent permutation between @xmath133 and @xmath0 are obtained empirically with corresponding @xmath108 then this situation may be an evidence for a conversion effect due to an interplay of vep and @xmath1 .    for large @xmath19 ( @xmath134 ev@xmath70 ) ,",
    "if energy dependent distortions ( and a change in @xmath101 ) is observed with the corresponding conversion probability greater than 1/2 then the cause may be a relatively large @xmath18 ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus , with the improved information on @xmath18 the cause of the conversion effect may be isolated .",
    "further , as the energy span in the relevant high energy agn neutrino spectra is several orders of magnitude , therefore , energy dependent spin ( flavour)-precession / conversion probabilities may result in distortions in some part(s ) of the spectra for relevant neutrino species and may thus be identifiable in existing / future high energy neutrino telescopes .",
