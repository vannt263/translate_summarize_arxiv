    "over the last decades , the fast developments in phenomenology and model - building have high - energy physicists at the tevatron with a number of new physics scenarios to investigate .",
    "searches at cdf have been either broad signature - based searches in accessible data samples for any discrepancy with the standard model ( sm ) in event yields or a specific new physics model - based searches .",
    "the signature - based searches proceed quickly in unprejudiced way as well as cover many new physics models .",
    "the model - based searches are highly sensitive for a particular model , and provide limits on the model . in this report we present two results using the signature - based search approach and one result in a model - based approach .",
    "all of these analyses use photons in the final state .",
    "we define a `` baseline '' sample with two isolated , central ( @xmath3 ) photons with @xmath4  gev .",
    "we then select subsamples which also contain at least one more energetic , isolated and well - defined object or where two photons are accompanied by large missing transverse energy ( ) . the additional object may be an electron ( @xmath5 ) , muon ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7-lepton ( @xmath7 ) , or jets .",
    "the integrated luminosity for each subsample varies from 1 to 2 fb@xmath8 . in next subsections",
    "we address each @xmath2 ( @xmath9 and ) subsample in turn .",
    "we describe the definition of the subsamples , the calculation of the sm predictions , and the comparison of the data and the predictions .",
    "unless it is otherwise noted , all analyses use the same definitions of the additional objects and kinematic variables : electrons , muons , @xmath7-leptons , jets , soft unclustered energy , , and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10 is defined as a scalar sum of  and @xmath11 s of all identified photons , leptons , and jets .",
    "we search in 1.1 fb@xmath8 of data for anomalous production of events containing two photons and at least one additional electron or muon .",
    "the selected @xmath13 and @xmath14 events must have at least one electron ( central or forward ) or muon ( @xmath15 ) candidate with @xmath16  gev and @xmath17  gev/@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "backgrounds for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 signatures of new physics include the sm production of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in association with two photons ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , where photons are radiated from either the initial state quarks , charged electroweak boson ( @xmath23 ) , or the final - state leptons .",
    "also there are misidentification backgrounds ( fake photons or leptons ) .",
    "backgrounds for the @xmath13 channel is dominated by @xmath24 production with an electron being misidentified as a photon .",
    "this is estimated by defining a sample of events with two electrons and one photon , then applying a probability , which is derived in data , for an electron to be misidentified as a photon .",
    "we find three @xmath13 events with an expected sm backgrounds of 6.82@xmath250.75 . in the @xmath14 channel",
    "the leading background is the electroweak tri - boson production of @xmath21 .",
    "we find no @xmath14 events and expect 0.79@xmath250.11 events .",
    "figure  [ fig : ggemu ] shows the @xmath10 distributions from data and the predicted backgrounds and we do not see any evidence for anomalous production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 events .",
    "we search for 2.0 fb@xmath8 of data for events with two photons and a hadronically decaying @xmath7-lepton .",
    "the selected @xmath27 events must have at least one @xmath7-lepton candidate identified using the tight requirements and passing @xmath28  gev .",
    "we consider two sources of backgrounds : the sm production of @xmath29 or @xmath30 with photons and @xmath31 events with jets misidentified as @xmath7-leptons .",
    "the dominant background in this search is from @xmath32 events where one of the jets is misidentified as a @xmath7-lepton . to estimate this background",
    ", we select events with two photons and a `` loose '' @xmath7-lepton candidate and apply the @xmath33 misidentification probability .",
    "since the misidentification probability is different for jets originated by quarks or by gluons , and the ratio of quark jets to gluon jets may be different than in the sample used to derive the @xmath33 misidentification probability , we corrected for this effect .",
    "we observe 34 events with 46@xmath2510 expectation .",
    "figure  [ fig : ggtau ] also shows the @xmath10 distribution for the selected @xmath26 candidate events and the predicted sm background , which indicates there is no anomalies .",
    "we search for the anomalous production of two photons and large missing transverse energy ( ) in 2 fb@xmath8 of data .",
    "the  is defined as an energy imbalance in the calorimeter and is an experimental signature of neutrino or new weakly interacting particle .",
    "the , however , can be mimicked by a simple energy misreconstruction in sm events ( `` fake '' ): for example , fluctuations in jet energy measurements .",
    "a better separation between events with real and fake  can be achieved if a significance of the measured  is considered rather than its absolute value .",
    "the -significance is a dimensionless quantity based on the energy resolution of jets and soft unclustered energy , taking into account the event topology . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : metsig ] , the -significance distributions have very different shapes in events with fake and real : exponentially falling ( solid line ) and almost flat shapes , respectively .",
    "thus , the -significance is an efficient tool in separating such events .",
    "for example , a cut on the -significance@xmath35 which reduces the mismeasured - energy background by a factor of @xmath36 , the sample becomes dominated by @xmath37 production , where the electron is misidentified as a photon .",
    "this background is estimated from monte carlo ( mc ) normalized to data .",
    "we observed 23 events and and expectation of 27.3@xmath252.3 events .",
    "we have also re - optimize the sample for the gmsb model  @xcite . in this model",
    ", all susy pair production decays to two neutralinos , the next - to - lightest susy particle , each of which then decays to a photon and a gravitino , the lightest susy particle ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we thus have two photons , , and other high-@xmath11 objects in the final state . using optimal set of cuts ( -significance , @xmath10 , and @xmath39 between two photons ) we set the world s best limit on the mass of 149  gev/@xmath1 at lifetime below 1  ns .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] .",
    "we search for new physics in the inclusive @xmath41 channel using 2.0 fb@xmath8 of data .",
    "we select an enhanced sample of events collected by an inclusive isolated photon trigger .",
    "we require a central ( @xmath42 ) photon with @xmath43  gev , two jets with @xmath44 and @xmath28  gev , at least one of which is identified as originating from a @xmath0-quark ( @xmath0-tagged ) , and greater than 25  gev .",
    "the backgrounds are misidentified photons ( `` misidentified @xmath40 '' ) , true photon plus light quark jet misidentified as heavy flavor ( `` true @xmath40 , misidentified @xmath0 '' ) , true photon plus true @xmath0-tagged jet ( `` @xmath45 '' ) , and true photon plus @xmath18-quark jet ( `` @xmath46 '' ) .",
    "the misidentified @xmath40 background is estimated from the data sample by using cluster - shape variables from the ces and hit rates in the cpr ( the ces / cpr method ) .",
    "this technique allows the determination of the number of photon candidates in the sample that are actually misidentified jets as well as the corresponding shapes of the distributions of kinematic variables .",
    "the true @xmath40 , misidentified @xmath0 background is estimated by first selecting events we then apply the true - photon weight ( the probability that a photon candidate is a photon ) determined using the ces / cpr method and the heavy - flavor mistag rate . because the ces / cpr method and the mistag parameterization provide event - by - event weights , we are able to determine the shapes of kinematic distributions as well as the number of events for this background .",
    "we estimate the @xmath45 and @xmath46 backgrounds by generating mc events .",
    "we obtain the overall normalizations of these backgrounds by fitting the secondary vertex mass distribution of the tagged jets , @xmath47 , to templates built from the mass distributions of the expected sm components .",
    "we first subtract the contribution due to misidentified photons by applying the ces / cpr method to obtain the number of misidentified photon events .",
    "we then estimate the fraction of heavy flavor in events with a misidentified photon by fitting the secondary vertex mass distribution in a sample enriched with jets faking photons .",
    "we then subtract the number of events containing a misidentified photon and heavy flavor from the number of events obtained from the standard photon sample fit to obtain the number of @xmath45 and @xmath46 events . figure  [ fig : fit ]",
    "shows the result of a secondary vertex fit performed on the search region using the templates to extract the fraction of @xmath0-jet and @xmath18-jet events .",
    "the total background prediction is 607@xmath2574@xmath2586 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the observed number of events is 617 , consistent with the sm background predictions .",
    "figure  [ fig : gbjmet ] shows the @xmath10 and the number of jets distributions in the sample of a photon , a @xmath0-tagged jet , a second jet and @xmath48 .",
    "this result is now published  @xcite .",
    "the sm prediction for the higgs , @xmath49 branching ratio is extremely small .",
    "however , in `` fermiophobic '' models , where the coupling of the higgs boson to fermions is highly suppressed , the diphoton decay can be greatly enhanced . since for this fermiophobic case ,",
    "the diphoton final state dominates at low higgs boson masses the diphoton final state becomes the preferred search channel .",
    "we select a diphoton sample from 3.0 fb@xmath8 of data , filtered by diphoton trigger .",
    "we then require both photons to be located within central region ( @xmath50 ) , referred to as `` central - central region '' , or one photon to be in this region and the other photon in plug region ( @xmath51 ) , referred to as `` central - forward region '' .",
    "individual photons are required to have @xmath28  gev , while the diphoton pair is required to have mass of @xmath52  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "however , the fermiophobic higgs boson is only produced at a non - negligible rate in association with a @xmath23/@xmath53 boson or via vector boson fusion process .",
    "since associated production dominates the production process the optimization was performed on the basis of the associated production process alone .",
    "a selection based on the following observables was optimized : diphoton transverse momentum ( @xmath54 ) , transverse momentum of the second highest @xmath55 jet ( @xmath56 ) for hadronic decays of @xmath57 , and missing transverse energy ( ) or transverse momentum of an isolated track ( @xmath58 ) for leptonic decays of @xmath57 . a variety of sets of these requirements which would select evidence of the @xmath23 or @xmath53 boson were carried out , but the only single requirement that the diphoton transverse momentum ( @xmath54 ) be greater than 75  gev/@xmath18 is approximately as sensitive as any combination of the other selection requirements . with this requirement on @xmath54 , roughly 30% of the signal remains while more than 99.5% of the background is removed .",
    "the decay of a higgs boson into a diphoton pair appears as a very narrow peak in the invariant mass distribution of this diphoton pair .",
    "the diphoton mass resolution determined from simulation is better than 3% for the higgs boson mass region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipho_mass]-(a ) and ( b ) . to establish the level of signal and background",
    ", we fit the diphoton mass spectrum to a background shape and the signal shape from a mc sample",
    ". the resulting invariant mass distributions of central - central and central - forward diphoton pair is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipho_mass]-(c ) .",
    "no evidence of such a resonance appears in the data so we set the 95% c.l .",
