    "the legendre transform is a mathematical tool with many applications in classical mechanics  @xcite ,  @xcite , statistical mechanics , thermodynamics  @xcite ,  @xcite , and computer vision problems  @xcite .",
    "it can be used to get all the possible tangents from a curve that is either convex or concave .",
    "the basis of the track reconstruction algorithm we propose is the transformation of each ellipse to the legendre space where an intersection of two curves represents a common tangent of the transformed functions .",
    "as shown in previous work by t. alexopoulos et al  @xcite ,  @xcite , the legendre transform can be applied on circles to detect their common tangent and in turn , the trajectory of a charged particle passing through the monitored drift chamber detector of atlas  @xcite experiment at cern  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we identify the common tangent lines of a given set of ellipses .",
    "the legendre transform is the core of the the proposed method .",
    "each ellipse is transformed into the legendre space , where the intersections of the transformed curves represent the common tangent lines of the ellipses .    to evaluate our method",
    ", we implement a hypothetical detector made of multiple layers of chambers whose output signal is an ellipse . based on these ellipses , we detect the common tangent line which in turn , represents the track of a particle transversing the detector .",
    "monte carlo generated tracks that pass through the detector are produced . as a track passes through the chambers ,",
    "elliptical hits are created .",
    "these ellipses are created so that they are concentric with the chambers and tangent to the track .",
    "we consider events during which only one track passes through the detector , as well as events with multiple tracks at once .",
    "our method is studied against non - ideal conditions such as the smearing of the ellipses dimensions and noise induced ellipses . a binary status of success",
    "is set based on the difference between the characteristics of the initial and reconstructed tracks .",
    "the characteristics of a line , or track , are it s @xmath0 and it s @xmath1 with the @xmath2-axis . the efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated as the ratio of the number of successfully reconstructed tracks to the number of monte carlo generated tracks .",
    "the legendre transform @xmath3 for a value @xmath4 of a given convex function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , is defined as : @xmath7 = -\\underset{x}{\\inf}\\left[f\\left(x\\right)-p   x\\right ] , \\ ] ] and that of a concave function , where @xmath8 , as : @xmath9 = -\\underset{x}{\\inf}\\left[p   x - f\\left(x\\right)\\right ] .\\ ] ]    the @xmath10 notation stands for the supremum of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , we seek the maximum of the function @xmath11 with respect to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is constant .",
    "geometrically , this means that we have a function @xmath14 and we are searching for @xmath12 so that a line with @xmath15 passes through @xmath16 and has a maximum intercept on the @xmath17 . that line will be tangent to @xmath14 and nothing else since @xmath14 is a convex function ( figure  [ fig : ellipse_functions_lt_merged ] ) .",
    "the @xmath18 stands for infimum and therefore minimization or in other words , the minimum intercept with the @xmath17 .    ) and a convex ( for @xmath19 ) function .",
    "the lines @xmath20 and @xmath21 are examples of the legendre transform for the concave and the convex part respectively . ]",
    "if we solve @xmath4 for @xmath12 , the legendre transform can be expressed as a function of @xmath13 : @xmath22 where each point @xmath23 in the legendre space represents a line , tangent to the curve @xmath14 where the slope is @xmath13 and the intersection of the line with the y - axis is @xmath24 or @xmath3 if the line is tangent to a convex function or a concave function respectively .",
    "therefore , the linear equation is defined as : @xmath25    it is now clear that an intersection @xmath26 of two or more curves in the legendre space represents a common tangent of the functions transformed into the legendre space .",
    "this is the basis of the tangent line finding method that we propose .",
    "our method is based on the transform of the ellipse to the legendre space .",
    "so , before the description of our method , we will apply the legendre transform on the ellipse and manipulate it to reduce the computational cost .",
    "the equation of an ellipse with center @xmath27 , major axis @xmath28 , and minor axis @xmath29 is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "since the legendre transform is only applicable to functions that are either convex or concave , we define the ellipse as a combination of convex and concave functions .",
    "therefore , equation  [ eq : ellipse ] solved for @xmath2 is : @xmath32    now , we can define the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 that refer to the concave and convex part of the ellipse respectively . @xmath35    with the equation of the ellipse broken down to a concave and a convex function ,",
    "the application of the legendre transform is trivial ( figure  [ fig : ellipse_functions_lt_merged ] ) .    for the concave part of the ellipse , the legendre transform for a concave function",
    "is applied : @xmath36 , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the first derivative of the function @xmath37 and so : @xmath38 but since @xmath37 is a concave function , we get : @xmath39    therefore the legendre transform of the concave part of the ellipse is : @xmath40    though a tangent of the ellipse can be defined by a @xmath41 pair , due to the large span of values that @xmath13 can take , it is more suitable to express the linear equation by its canonical form ( figure  [ fig : canon_line ] ) , where @xmath42 : @xmath43 so that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "has a canonical representation of a line segment that starts from the axis origin and is perpendicular to the line @xmath46 .",
    "the line segment of length @xmath47 and forms a @xmath48 angle with the x - axis .",
    "similarly , line @xmath49 has a canonical representation of a line segment of length @xmath50 and slope @xmath51 .",
    "line @xmath49 is parallel to @xmath52 and has the opposite intercept with @xmath2-axis as @xmath52 has .",
    "therefore @xmath53 has a canonical representation of a line segment of length @xmath54 and slope @xmath51 .",
    "the minus sign means that the intersection takes place below the @xmath12-axis . ]    therefore , the legendre transform becomes : @xmath55    equation  [ eq : lte_concave ] represents a sinogram in the @xmath56 legendre transformation space where each @xmath57 pair represents a line in the @xmath58 space .",
    "following the same calculation steps , we conclude that the legendre transform for the convex case is : @xmath59 while each of the @xmath60 pairs represent a tangent line in the @xmath58 space . and",
    "in canonical form : @xmath61    therefore , the legendre transform of the ellipse is : @xmath62 and in canonical form ( figure  [ fig : lte_canon ] ) : @xmath63        if we assume that @xmath64 , which means that our ellipse is actually a circle , then equation  [ eq : lte_canon_form ] matches the resulted equation of the previous work on the legendre transform on circles  @xcite .    now that we have found the legendre transform of the ellipse in canonical form , we design and implement a method that utilizes the result of the transformation ( equation  [ eq : lte_canon_form ] ) to find the common tangent of a set of ellipses .",
    "the transformation of each ellipse of a set of ellipses in the legendre space will result in a series of curves .",
    "the intersections of these curves represent the common tangents of the transformed ellipses .",
    "the point through which all of the curves pass is the common tangent of the set of ellipses .",
    "in this section , we describe the method used for reconstructing tangent lines from a set of ellipses .",
    "the input of the algorithm is a set of symmetrical ellipses and the dimensions of the @xmath65 space that is to be analysed .",
    "an ellipse consists of it s center , @xmath27 , and it s major and minor axes , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "based on the number of the given ellipses @xmath66 , we calculate a maximum number of possible tangent lines @xmath67 as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a minimum expected number of ellipses per tangent and the coefficient @xmath70 means that the set of ellipses is expected to be symmetrical .",
    "if that is the case , then there will two common tangent lines for each set of ellipses ( figure  [ fig : ellipse_tangent_3s ] ) .",
    "also , that number is always rounded up .",
    "although @xmath67 results in more tangent lines that should exist , during the execution of the algorithm the excess tangent lines will be discarded for various reasons we explain later .",
    "while transforming the ellipses to the legendre space , we fill two - dimensional histograms with the results of equation  [ eq : lte_canon_form ] for each given ellipse , iterating over @xmath71 .",
    "the legendre transform provides us with two curves per given ellipse .",
    "each curve raises the value of each bin through which it passes .",
    "consequently , the intersections of the curves create peaks in the histograms .",
    "just like the intersections of the curves , the peaks represent the common tangent lines of the ellipses .",
    "since these curves are sinograms , they form clusters of high value bins around the peaks . to detect the peaks in the histograms , the clusters that surround each peak must be extracted .",
    "therefore , the following clustering algorithm is implemented .",
    "the extraction of the tangent lines consists of two steps in which two dimensional histograms in the legendre space are used .",
    "first , a primary step during which we search for peaks in a single two - dimensional histogram ( figure  [ fig : hist_prim_ex ] ) that covers all of the legendre space that corresponds to the @xmath65 area that includes the ellipses .",
    "then , a secondary step , during which we review the areas with the highest peaks found in the primary histogram .",
    "a two - dimensional histogram is used for each area ( figures  [ fig : hist_seco_ex_1 ] and [ fig : hist_seco_ex_2 ] ) .",
    "0.75      +    0.75     the histograms of the two steps differ from one another .",
    "the first step uses a histogram that has a fixed number of bins for both axes and when a curve passes through a bin , the number of hits of that bin is increased by one .",
    "this serves to reduce the load of the analysis and process quickly a large area whose most part does not give us any valuable information concerning the lines .",
    "the second step uses fixed bin sizes for each axis and when a curve passes through a bin , a two - dimensional gaussian signal is added on the histogram , using that bin as it s center .",
    "this serves to either greatly increase the accuracy of the lines or reject the false positives .      during the primary step , for the creation of the histogram",
    ", the histogram s size is addressed first .",
    "we know that @xmath42 and the @xmath72-axis is calculated from equation  [ eq : lte_canon_form ] .",
    "to do so , the dimensions of the area , in the @xmath73 space , that is to be analysed is taken into account .",
    "therefore , we get :    @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the maximum value that the major axis @xmath28 of an ellipse can have . due to the massive size of the @xmath72-axis , we use a fixed number of bins instead of fixed bin sizes .    after filling the histogram ,",
    "a threshold for the height of the bins of the histogram is applied and all bins under that specified threshold are ignored .",
    "the threshold is set to @xmath76 curves since a minimum of 3 ellipses in a set is required so that the set can have a maximum of two common tangent lines ( figures  [ fig : ellipse_tangent_3 ] and [ fig : ellipse_tangent_3s ] ) .",
    "then , we sort the bins by height and then put them through an iterative process which attempts to result in clusters with the peaks at their centers .    0.4        0.4      +    0.4        0.4     for each of the clusters , the bin with the greatest value is detected . if the @xmath77 of its value is higher than the specified threshold , then , for that cluster only , the threshold is set to the @xmath77 of the peak s value .",
    "then , we calculate the ratio of the sum of the hits ( height ) of each bin ( above threshold ) to the total number of bins ( above threshold ) of the cluster .",
    "the smallest orthogonal boundary possible is set to each of the clusters according to the positions of the bins above threshold . finally , the mean values of @xmath72 and @xmath78 are calculated , as well as the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 with the corresponding errors :    @xmath79    the clusters are sorted based on their hits per bin ratios . as possible solutions , we consider the @xmath67 clusters with the largest ratios . these clusters will advance to the secondary step for further processing",
    ".    we should clarify that each cluster represents a different line and therefore a different solution to our problem .",
    "this means that our algorithm always works for a set of ellipses that consists of multiple subsets of ellipses , where each subset has it s own tangent , and assumes that the sets of ellipses are symmetric , meaning that two tangent lines correspond to each set , until proven otherwise .      during the secondary step , we create multiple two - dimensional histograms , one for each of the clusters with the greatest ratios from the primary histogram .",
    "the boundaries of each histogram is the boundary of the cluster being analysed .",
    "this allows us to search each histogram for a single line instead of multiple lines as before .",
    "in addition , due to the small size of the secondary histograms , we can use fixed bin sizes for both axes , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the @xmath78-axis and @xmath72-axis respectively .",
    "as far as the @xmath78-axis is concerned , we choose the @xmath80 step for the bin size . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath72-axis depends on @xmath78 and so the bin size will be calculated by applying the variance formula on equation  [ eq : lte_canon_form ] :    @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the measurement errors of the major and minor axes of the ellipses respectively . if we consider the worst error of both axes for both axes , meaning @xmath85 , we get :    @xmath86 we also know that @xmath87 and so @xmath88 , therefore :    @xmath89 also , taking into account that @xmath90 , we conclude that :    @xmath91 therefore , the error of the line parameter @xmath72 consists of the angle step @xmath92 , the expected measurement error @xmath93 and the center of the ellipse @xmath94 . to ensure consistency in our results , we prefer a uniform binning , independent of the bin under examination and the position of the ellipse . for this purpose , we select the angle step @xmath80 to be small enough so that @xmath95 .    to have the greatest accuracy possible ,",
    "the sizes of the bins are going to have to be as small as possible . that may cause errors in noisy environments since the hits will not create a peak in a certain bin , but rather spread around . therefore , to keep the steps small but avoid errors",
    ", we turn to an alternative solution .",
    "the key for creating peaks in a histogram that otherwise , due to errors , would not exist , is the use of a gaussian kernel based analysis .",
    "it has been shown that the use of gaussian sums in histograms increases the effectiveness of algorithms and makes them robust against noise @xcite .",
    "so , we apply gaussian signals instead of simply increasing the hits of the appropriate bins during the transformation to the legendre space .",
    "the mean of a gaussian signal will be the center of the @xmath78-axis bin being iterated and the corresponding @xmath96 value , and the steps @xmath97 and @xmath98 will serve as the standard deviations @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , concluding to a gaussian signal : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an arbitrary constant .    therefore , for every @xmath78-axis bin in the histogram , gaussian signals ( equation  [ eq : gauss_signal ] ) for each part of each ellipse are calculated and added to the histogram . the curves for the convex and the concave part of an ellipse in the legendre space should never intersect with each other but we still have to evaluate both of them since we do not have a priori knowledge of which of the curves pass through the cluster under consideration .",
    "the same goes for all the ellipses as well , meaning that not all of them will have a tangent line represented by the specific @xmath103 pair in the histogram under construction .    to maintain a low computational cost",
    ", the gaussian signal is truncated . in other words ,",
    "the value of the signal is added to the histogram only if it is above a specified threshold .",
    "therefore , the iterative process starts from the peak of the gaussian signal and continues outwards in consecutive boxes until it reaches the aforementioned threshold where the iterative processes stops .",
    "apart for the aforementioned differences , the rest of the procedure is same as in the primary step .",
    "we apply the thresholds , narrow down the peak of each cluster , sort the clusters based on their hits per bin ratios , calculate the mean values , and extract the line parameters .      after tracking the lines",
    ", we can further increase the accuracy of their characteristics or dismiss false positives with a @xmath76 step procedure .      as a first step ,",
    "if possible , the given ellipses are associated with the detected lines if they fulfil a certain criterion : the distance @xmath104 between the detected line and the closest point of the ellipse to the line must be smaller than @xmath105 times the value of @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath105 is an arbitrary constant integer .    for each ellipse , we create two lines parallel to our detected line as in figure  [ fig : tracks_parallel_ellipse ] . one parallel line tangent to the concave part of the ellipse and the other parallel line tangent to the convex part of the ellipse .",
    "we keep the line closest to the detected line and then apply the criterion .     and the parallels @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in this case , @xmath108 will be chosen . ]",
    "if a line has less ellipses that a required minimum , we consider it to be a false positive and therefore reject it .      for each line with an adequate number of ellipses",
    ", we can apply a linear fit to increase their accuracy . prior to that",
    ", a series of tangent points must be located between the lines and their associated ellipses .    to locate the tangent point between a line and its ellipse , the closest parallel is used ( figure  [ fig : tracks_parallel_ellipse ] ) .",
    "therefore , for a parallel line of the form @xmath110 , the tangent points @xmath111 are calculated using the equations : @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath94 is the center of the ellipse and @xmath28 , @xmath29 the ellipse s major and minor axis respectively .",
    "we repeat this task for each of the ellipses associated with a detected line .",
    "then , a linear fit is performed on the tangent points .",
    "we use the attributes of the detected line as initial values for the fitting procedure .      during the final stage of the algorithm",
    ", we perform a @xmath114 test on the fitted lines . the ratio of @xmath114 to the number of degrees of freedom ( ndf )",
    "is required to be less than @xmath115 @xmath116 .",
    "lines that do nt meet the requirement are rejected .",
    "this prevents from noise induced ellipses to create prevailing lines .",
    "to study our method , we implement a hypothetical detector as illustrated in figure  [ fig : det_specs ] .",
    "the detector consists of layers of chambers , the intersection of which is orthogonal . using toy monte carlo generated lines that represent the tracks of a hypothetical charged particle , ellipses in the appropriate chambers are created .",
    "then , we apply the smearing of the ellipse s characteristics and the noise of the electronics .",
    "our proposed method reconstructs the tracks based on these ellipses . finally , we compare the attributes of the initial , monte carlo generated , tracks with the attributes of the reconstructed tracks .",
    "the hypothetical detector consists of @xmath117 layers of chambers ( table [ tab : det_specs ] ) .",
    "these chambers have an orthogonal intersection @xmath118 wide and @xmath119 high .",
    "the detector spans from @xmath120 to @xmath121 on @xmath12-axis and it s base is placed at @xmath122 .",
    "the height of the detector depends on the number of layers and the height of the chambers",
    ". therefore , our detector is @xmath123 high .    .detectors specifications . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : multi_track_results ]",
    "we propose a pattern recognition method to detect the tangent lines of sets of ellipses using the legendre transform .",
    "this method reconstructs tracks of particles passing through a hypothetical detector . to evaluate our method ,",
    "the reconstructed tracks are compared against the initial , monte carlo generated , tracks .",
    "based on the initial tracks , the ellipses with which the algorithm operates are created and then to simulate the measurement errors and the noise of the electronics , the smearing of the ellipses takes place and additional ellipses are created respectively .",
    "the results show that our method is robust on detecting tangent lines of both ellipses with untampered characteristics and ellipses whose dimensions have been smeared , as well as with additional ellipses that simulate the noise of the electronics .",
