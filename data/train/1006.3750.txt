    "knowledge of the @xmath1 transition line in atomic yb and corresponding frequency shifts for the stable isotopes is very important in these experiments as they allow for laser cooling and isotope selective photoionisation @xcite .",
    "various methods have been used to investigate these transitions , and corresponding isotope shifts @xcite .",
    "+ we present our measurements of the ytterbium @xmath0 transition frequencies which differ from previously published results @xcite . using a simple method based upon observing and aligning fluorescence spots of atomic yb generated from an atomic oven in an evacuated glass beljar",
    "we have measured resonant transition frequencies and isotope shifts to an accuracy of 60 mhz .",
    "our results are compared to the results obtained using saturation absorption spectroscopy and were further verified by ionising and trapping yb ions .",
    "+ the advantage of our technique is that it can be used to determine resonance frequencies when the atomic beam is not necessarily perpendicular to the propagation of the laser , which can be the case in many experiments .",
    "these doppler shifts also depend on the mean velocity of the atomic beam , so the measurement is quite useful . using our technique",
    "we were able to measure the doppler shift of the transition frequency under a range of angles and then derive average velocity of atoms along the direction of atomic beam .",
    "to drive the @xmath0 399 nm dipole transition an inexpensive in - house built ultra violet external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) was used .",
    "the ecdl was formed with a laser diode ( frequency selected to 399 nm , sanyo diode : dl-4146 - 301s ) and a diffraction grating ( newport : 53-*-240r ) positioned in the littrow configuration .",
    "a piezo electric actuator was used to adjust the angle of the grating and thus tuning of the emission wavelength . to stabilise the emission wavelength",
    "a high finesse wavelength meter ( ws-07 , with specified wavelength accuracy of 60 mhz ) and ni - daq cards operating under labview real time were used .",
    "the wavemeter is calibrated using a 780 nm laser which is locked to within 1 mhz of the @xmath2rb d@xmath3 line .",
    "it measures the wavelength of the ecdl and sends the information to a labview program , via a ni - daq card ( na-6143 ) .",
    "the program determines a drift in wavelength and generates the corresponding error signal to keep the laser stable . + to perform saturation spectroscopy on the @xmath0 399 nm isotope transitions the ecdl frequency was required to scan over a range of 3 ghz . however , adjustment of the grating angle alone in the ecdl resulted in a mode hop free tuning range of only 800 mhz . to overcome this",
    "the piezo voltage and laser diode current were adjusted simultaneously to produce a mode hop free tuning range of over 5.5 ghz . for our technique an atomic flux propagating in a known direction was required as this enabled localised fluorescence spots that could be be spatially resolved . to generate the yb atomic beam a resistivly heated stainless steel oven tube ( 2 cm long and 1.5 mm diameter ) was used .",
    "a small piece of natural yb was placed inside the oven and yb atomic beam could be obtained by running an electric current of 5 to 6 amperes over the oven .",
    "the atomic oven was placed inside a vacuum chamber maintained at a pressure on the order of @xmath4 torr .",
    "we have devised a simple method that works by observing fluorescence spots produced by laser - atom interaction at resonant wavelengths .",
    "the experimental setup for our spot method can be seen in figure [ fig : scheme ] , here two pairs of non - overlapping counter propagating laser beams ( each with an intensity of approximately 4.5 mw@xmath5 ) are passed through an atomic beam . for orientation the cylindrical axis of the oven tube",
    "is considered as the reference axis and the lasers are aligned perpendicular to this reference axis unless otherwise stated .",
    "+    ( a ) ( b )    the atoms from the oven interact with the four laser beams producing 4 fluorescence spots . in the frame of reference of laser beam propagation",
    "each laser interacts with atoms of the same velocity group .",
    "when viewed in the laboratory frame the four spots are seen to be misaligned when the frequency is detuned from resonance , but when on resonance the four spots are seen to align perpendicular to the propagation of the laser beams . in this situation",
    "each laser is interacting with atoms of zero velocity perpendicular to the atomic beam .",
    "spot alignment can be seen in figure [ fig : illustration ] where [ fig : illustration](b ) corresponds to when the laser frequency is on resonance and [ fig : illustration](a)/(c ) corresponds to when the laser frequency is detuned -20 mhz/+20 mhz from resonance respectively .",
    "this phenomenon occurs irrespective of the angle between the cylindrical axis of the ovens and the laser beams , which is discussed later .",
    "+     ( a )   ( b )   ( c )    in order to obtain the @xmath6 transition frequencies , the frequency of the 399 nm laser diode was scanned slowly over 3 ghz . during the scan",
    "the florescence spots were imaged using an inexpensive ccd camera setup . after narrowing down the scanning range ,",
    "the frequencies of the transitions of the different isotopes were individually measured by aligning the four spots in a straight line with the cylindrical axis of the atomic oven .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : illustration ] .",

    "the wavemeter was calibrated before and after measurements and no change in calibration measurements were observed .",
    "the wavemeter is specified to have an accuracy of 60 mhz for absolute frequency measurements , but is more accurate for relative frequency measurements of closely spaced transitions .",

    "therefore the error on transition frequencies is 60 mhz and the error on isotope shifts is 30 mhz .",

    "other sources of error include non - parallel alignment of the lasers where beam misalignment of 1 degree related to 15 mhz error on wavelengths . as the technique can resolve a 20 mhz detuning from resonance it was possible to align the lasers to better than 1 degree as misalignment would result in a visible deviation of the spots .",
    "power broadening of the transition line was insignificant as each beam was less than @xmath21 mw@xmath5 whereas the saturation intensity of the transition is 60 mw@xmath5 , which translates to a 3 mhz linewidth broadening .",
    "the potential resolution of the technique can be seen from figure [ fig : illustration ] where the frequency of the laser has been detuned from ( b ) resonance by ( a)-20 mhz and ( c)+20 mhz .",
    "the separation from the front of the oven to the furthest spot is approximately 22 mm , and by observing spot misalignment at a given detuning we extrapolate that the resolution of the technique can be 10 mhz in this particular setup .     transition peaks for different isotopes of yb obtained with saturation absorption spectroscopy .",

    "to provide a comparison for the transition frequencies and isotope shifts obtained by our spot method , a typical saturation absorption spectroscopy experiment was set up . the saturation spectroscopy setup consisted of a pump and probe beam ( 127 mw@xmath5 and 2 mw@xmath5 respectively ) counter propagating and overlapping through ytterbium atomic beam . by scanning the wavelength of the external cavity diode laser the saturation plot shown in figure [ fig : saturation ]",

    "it can be seen that the results obtained from the saturation spectroscopy are in good agreement with the results from our fluorescence spot method . however",
    "the signal to noise ratio using the saturation spectroscopy setup is poor compare to spot method .",
    "further to this , saturation spectroscopy can only be used to determine the resonant transition frequencies but not doppler shifted transition frequencies in non - perpendicular laser - atomic beam configurations which can be useful in ion trap experiments .

    "the doppler shifted wavelengths the earlier setup was adjusted by rotating the oven to form an angle with the lasers .",
    "this provided maximum atomic flux for the desired angle , while the cylindrical axis of the atomic oven offered a reference axis to which the spots could be aligned .",
    "this scheme is illustrated in figure : [ laserbeam ] . here",
    "the direction of propagation of the laser beams must be taken into account because one pair of the laser beams ( 2 and 4 ) makes an acute angle @xmath24 while the other pair ( beam 1 and 3 ) forms an obtuse angle @xmath22 with the reference axis . in both cases",
    "the magnitude of the angular difference from 90@xmath23 ( and hence the frequency shift ) is the same , but the sign is different . to align a pair of spots to the reference axis the laser frequency was detuned from resonance by a certain amount .",
    "blue detuning the laser frequency causes fluorescence spots ( corresponding to lasers 2 and 4 ) to align to the reference axis , while red detuning causes fluorescence spots ( from lasers 1 and 3 ) to align to the reference axis .",
    "figure : [ angleshift ] demonstrates these doppler shifted resonance spots when the angle between laser and the atomic beam is ( a ) @xmath25 and ( c ) @xmath26 .",
    "a particular advantage of the spot method can be realised in figure : [ angleshift](b ) , that when on resonance the four spots form a line perpendicular to the laser beams .",
    "this allows for the resonant transition frequency to be measured independent of the angle between the laser beam and atomic beam .",
    "the doppler shift on the resonance frequency depends on the velocity component , of the atoms , parallel ( or anti parallel ) to the propagation of the lasers , which is dependant upon the cosine of the angle @xmath27 between the atomic motion and the propagation of laser .",

    "equation [ dopplershift ] was fitted to the data and enables us to derive the average velocity of the atoms in the direction of atomic beam .",
    "using our data we have determined the average atomic velocity to be 260@xmath8 20 ms@xmath34 and therefore the temperature of the atomic beam can be estimated .",
    "+ using frequencies measured from our technique we were able to photoionise and trap yb@xmath35 isotopes in an ion trapping experiment @xcite .",
    "to ionise a yb atom a 399 nm photon is required to drive the @xmath0 transition where a further 369 nm photon excites an electron past the continuum @xcite . in the ion trapping experiment the atomic oven and 399 nm laser made an angle of 63@xmath82@xmath23 .",
