    "high accuracy measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy revealed that the cosmological density perturbations obey the nearly scale - invariant power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the inflaton , which drives the inflationary expansion of the very early universe , has quantum fluctuations on large scales and it is a prime candidate for the origin of the nearly scale invariant curvature perturbation  @xcite .",
    "however , it was recognized that the curvature perturbation can be generated without invoking the quantum fluctuation of the inflaton itself",
    ". there may be many scalar fields in the physics beyond the standard model , and some of which may be light during inflation and obtain quantum fluctuations . in the curvaton mechanism",
    "@xcite , such a light scalar other than the inflaton , called curvaton , is responsible for the curvature perturbation .",
    "another possibility is to make the inflaton decay rate fluctuate due to another light scalar having large scale perturbations  @xcite .",
    "then the radiation produced by the inflaton decay has curvature perturbation even if the inflaton itself does not have enough fluctuations .",
    "this is called the modulated reheating scenario .",
    "mechanisms for generating the curvature perturbation which shares a similar idea to the modulated reheating have been proposed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new mechanism to generate the curvature perturbation , which is a variant type of the modulated reheating scenario .",
    "the idea is that if a particle velocity is fluctuating on large scales , its decay rate also does since the lifetime of a particle receives a spatially fluctuating lorentz boost .",
    "therefore , the modulated reheating is realized even if an intrinsic decay rate does not depend on some fluctuating scalar fields as in the original modulated reheating scenario .    as a concrete example",
    ", such a large scale fluctuation in the particle velocity is generated if it is produced nonthermally by the decay of a heavier particle whose mass depends on another light scalar with large scale fluctuations . in this setup , modulated reheating occurs at two stages : one is at the decay of a heavier particle with a fluctuating mass , the other is at the decay of a daughter particle whose velocity is fluctuating .",
    "the final curvature perturbation receives both of the two contributions , as well as that generated by the inflaton .",
    "we will systematically calculate the resulting curvature perturbation and estimate the non - gaussianity , and find that the effect of modulated velocity is important if the velocity at the decay is not much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "let us suppose that a particle @xmath0 has a decay width of @xmath1 at the @xmath0 rest frame and that its velocity is given by @xmath2 in the laboratory frame . due to the time delay effect , the effective decay rate of @xmath0 in the laboratory looks like @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "then let us imagine a situation that the @xmath0 particles are non - interacting and have a monochromatic velocity distribution within a small patch of the universe but on large scales their velocities fluctuate .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the velocities of @xmath0-particles have large scale fluctuations on the decay hypersurface ( @xmath5 in the sudden decay approximation where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter ) . on this surface",
    ", @xmath0 has a velocity of @xmath7 finally the @xmath0-particles decay into radiation .",
    "since the decay hypersurface does not coincide with the uniform density hypersurface due to the fluctuated lorentz factor , the curvature perturbation is induced at the @xmath0-decay . in this setup ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is estimated as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy density of the @xmath0 at the decay relative to the total energy density and @xmath10 .",
    "thus the large scale fluctuation on the velocity can be converted to the curvature perturbation via the modulated reheating .",
    "obviously , if the @xmath0 particles are non - relativistic ( @xmath11 ) , such an effect is negligible .",
    "also in the ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath12 ) , the curvature perturbation is not generated since the equation of state of the universe does not change across the @xmath0-decay .",
    "therefore , this effect is expected to be important if the @xmath0 particles are semi - relativistic @xmath13 . if the @xmath14 is a gaussian random variable , then the corresponding curvature perturbation is also guassian at the linear order in @xmath14 .",
    "this is a generic idea and may have a potential of broad applications . in the next section we provide a concrete setup which results in the velocity fluctuation and induces the curvature perturbation .",
    "we consider a situation that non - relativistic scalar condensate of the @xmath15 field decays into relativistic @xmath0-particles and subsequently @xmath0-particles decay into radiation is a scalar field is not essential to achieve the velocity modulation .",
    "the mechanism can work for the cases where @xmath15 is not a scalar field as well . ] .",
    "our key assumption is that the mass of @xmath15 spatially fluctuates .",
    "this can be achieved if the mass is dependent on a light scalar field which acquired spatial fluctuations during inflation .",
    "such fluctuations of the mass result in the generation of the primordial curvature perturbations through two different processes . in the following ,",
    "let us roughly estimate the resulting curvature perturbation .",
    "more detailed calculations will be given later .",
    "if the mass of @xmath15 spatially fluctuates , then generically the decay rate does too .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath0 is a fermion .",
    "the @xmath15 decays into a @xmath0 pair through the yukawa interaction , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the yukawa coupling constant , then the decay rate is given by @xmath18 if @xmath0 is a scalar , @xmath15 can decay into them through the three point interaction , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a coupling constant having mass dimension one .",
    "then the decay rate is given by @xmath21 it is clear from these equations that fluctuation of @xmath22 is taken over by @xmath23 . for concreteness",
    "we assume @xmath0 is a fermion in the following , although qualitative arguments do not depend on whether it is a fermion or scalar .",
    "the density fluctuations of @xmath0 are produced when @xmath15 decays ; @xmath24 this is exactly the same mechanism of generating the curvature perturbation in the modulated reheating scenario .",
    "since each @xmath0-particle has an energy @xmath25 when it is produced , velocity of the produced @xmath0-particle is given by @xmath26 it is clear that the velocity @xmath2 also fluctuates if @xmath22 fluctuates .",
    "we assume that the interaction of @xmath0-particle is sufficiently weak so that it does not take part in thermal bath and the velocity remains constant except for the redshift by the cosmic expansion .- particles can scatter off themselves by the exchange of @xmath15 .",
    "this process is suppressed if the coupling constant between @xmath15 and @xmath0 is small and/or the @xmath15 is heavy enough . ] otherwise , the @xmath0-particles obey thermal distribution with a background temperature of the radiation and the velocity fluctuation will be smoothed out as long as @xmath0 is subdominant .",
    "now , let us suppose that the velocity of @xmath0-particle has dropped to @xmath27 due to the cosmological redshift when @xmath0-particles decay .",
    "taking into account the effect of time delation , the decay rate of @xmath0 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the decay rate measured at the rest frame .",
    "since @xmath27 is position dependent , this equation manifests that the decay rate of @xmath0 spatially fluctuates too ; @xmath30 again , the modulation of @xmath31 gives additional contribution to the curvature perturbation .",
    "denoting by @xmath9 a fraction of @xmath0-particles when they decay , we expect that the final curvature perturbation @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 therefore , if @xmath0-particles are still relativistic when they decay , i.e. @xmath34 , then the effect of the velocity modulation on the final curvature perturbation can not be neglected",
    ".      now let us evaluate the curvature perturbation based on the @xmath35-formalism @xcite .",
    "we adopt the so - called sudden decay approximation in which the decay of @xmath15 or @xmath0-particles is assumed to occur instantaneously when the decay rate becomes equal to the hubble expansion rate  @xcite .",
    "let us take a hypersurface just before the @xmath15 field decays on which the total energy density is spatially uniform ( uniform density hypersurface ) .",
    "we here assume that @xmath15 begins to oscillate in a period between the end of inflation and the completion of reheating where the universe expands like a matter - dominated universe and that the initial amplitude is constant . in this case",
    "the energy density of the @xmath15 condensation does not fluctuate on the uniform density slice even if its mass fluctuates . begins to oscillate during the radiation - dominated era after the reheating , the energy density of @xmath15 itself also has fluctuations .",
    "we do not consider such a case since it only makes the following analyses more complicated .",
    "] since no fluctuations exist before @xmath15 decays , this hypersurface coincides with the spatially flat hypersurface .",
    "let us denote by @xmath36 a required e - folding number from the flat hypersurface to the decay hypersurface on which @xmath15 decays into @xmath0-particles .",
    "since @xmath23 spatially fluctuates , @xmath36 does too .",
    "thus we have @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the energy densities of the radiation and @xmath15 at the @xmath15-decay .",
    "the total energy density is given by @xmath40 .",
    "quantities with bars represent the background values .",
    "this is rewritten in the form as @xmath41 where @xmath42 at the @xmath15-decay .",
    "let us next consider a hypersurface just after the @xmath15 decays on which @xmath43 is spatially uniform and denote by @xmath44 a required e - folding number from the decay hypersurface to uniform @xmath43 hypersurface .",
    "then equation for @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the effective equation of state parameter @xmath47 of @xmath0 evaluated on the decay surface .",
    "according to the @xmath35 formalism , the sum of @xmath36 and @xmath44 gives the curvature perturbation of the uniform @xmath43 hypersurface ; @xmath48 eqs .",
    "( [ deltan1 ] ) , ( [ deltan2 ] ) and ( [ zetasigma ] ) allow us to express @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 , which we defer .",
    "unless @xmath46 is zero , @xmath49 is non - vanishing , as it should be .",
    "since @xmath0-particles do not interact with the other particles , @xmath49 is conserved until @xmath0-particles decay into radiation . on the other hand , @xmath51 ,",
    "the curvature perturbation on the uniform @xmath38 hypersurface , is zero since we assume that @xmath15 decays only into @xmath0-particles .",
    "now we consider a difference between a hypersurface on which @xmath0-particles decay into radiation and a one on which @xmath43 is uniform .",
    "let us denote by @xmath52 a required e - folding number from uniform @xmath43 hypersurface to @xmath0 decay hypersurface .",
    "then we obtain @xmath53 this is rewritten as @xmath54 where @xmath55 on the @xmath0-decay surface and @xmath56 is the effective equation of state parameter of @xmath0 on this hypersurface .",

    "the integral in the exponent starts from the time of @xmath15-decay and ends at the @xmath0-decay .",
    "it is soon seen that in the relativistic limit @xmath65 , @xmath9 remains constant as is expected .",
    "the equation of state of @xmath0 at its production @xmath66 and decay @xmath67 are also related .",
