    "the two curves are rather similar in nature , with the negative of the langevin function assuming , in general , greater _ absolute _ expected values for a given @xmath53 .",
    "the usual use of the langevin function is to describe the thermodynamic behavior of noninteracting particles with _",
    "nonquantized _ spin . in this same paradigm ,",
    "the _ brillouin _ function , that is @xmath54 , is employed for spin-@xmath6 particles @xcite .",
    "( its spin-1 counterpart is @xmath55 . ) however , lavenda @xcite has argued that , in contrast to the langevin function , the brillouin function lacks a proper probabilistic foundation , since its generating function can not be derived as the laplace transform of a prior probability density  .",
    "he also writes @xcite : `` even in this simple case of the langevin function  we have witnessed a transition from a statistics dictated by the central - limit theorem , at weak - fields , to one governed by extreme - value distributions , at strong - fields .",
    "such richness is not possessed by the brillouin function , for although it is almost identical to the langevin function in the weak - field limit , the brillouin function becomes independent of the field in the strong - field limit . in the latter limit",
    ", it would imply complete saturation which does not lead to any probability distribution .",
    "this is yet another inadequacy of modeling ferromagnetism by a brillouin function , in the mean field approximation . ''",
    "additionally , lavenda asserts @xcite that the langevin function `` has empirically been targeted as providing a good description of hysteresis curves in ferromagnetic materials when the field due to interdomain coupling is added to the actual internal field to produce an effective field .",
    "this effective field is analogous to the weiss mean field experienced by individual magnetic moments within a single domain . for a sufficiently large interdomain coupling parameter ,",
    "an elementary form of hystersis loop has been observed in the modified langevin function . moreover , since the generating function must be expresed as a laplace transform of a prior distribution , in order to make physical as well as statistical sense , this rules out certain other candidates like the brillouin function . for particles of spin-@xmath6",
    ", the generating function would be proportional to the hyperbolic cosine , and the hyperbolic cosine can not be expressed as a laplace transform of a prior distribution . ''      in his claims",
    "that the langevin function provides a good description of certain magnetic phenomena , lavenda refers to the work of jiles and atherton @xcite . ``",
    "the jiles - atherton theory is based on considerations of the dependence of energy dissipation within a magnetic material resulting from changes in its magnetization .",
    "the algorithm based on the theory yields five computed model parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath16 , which represent the saturation magnetization , the effective domain density , the mean exchange coupling between the effective domains , the flexibility of domain walls and energy - dissipative features in the microstructure , respectively  the model parameter @xmath14 is derived from an analogy to the langevin expression for the anhysteretic magnetization @xmath57 as a function of both temperature @xmath58 and field @xmath59 for a paramagnet  however , in the jiles - atherton theory , the spin entity @xmath60 is not an atomic magnetic moment @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the bohr magneton , as in the original langevin expression .",
    "rather , it represents the moment from a mesoscopic collections of spins that we refer to as an ` effective domain ; ' each ` effective domain ' possesses a collective magnetic moment @xmath60 .",
    "these effective domain entities may or may not correspond to actual magnetic domains '' @xcite .",
    "brody and hughston @xcite propose the use of the negative of the langevin function , that is ( [ langevin ] ) , for the internal energy of a ( small ) system of spin-@xmath6 particles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "brody ( personal communication ) has suggested that `` after all , standard ( einstein s ) approach to quantum statistical mechanics does seem to work for bulk objects , so there seems to be some kind of ` transition ' from micro to macro scales '' .",
    "`` we note that in the case of the quantum canonical ensemble the heat capacity for this [ spin-@xmath6 ] system is nonvanishing at zero temperature .",
    "since it is known in the case of many bulk substances that the heat capacity vanishes as zero temperature is approached , it would be interesting to enquire if a single electron possesses a different behaviour , as indicated by our results '' @xcite .      in sec .",
    "5.2 , entitled `` superparamagnetism '' ( that is , the `` phenomenon of the loss of ferromagnetism in small particles '' ) of his recent text @xcite , aharoni writes : `` a single particle of such a small size can not be made or handled .",
    "experiments are therefore carried out on an ensemble of particles , which in most cases have a wide distribution of particle sizes",
    ". such particles would give rise to a superposition of langevin functions with different values of @xmath64 in the argument , and the measured curve could not possibly look like the langevin function  with improved techniques for producing very small particles , their size distribution has become narrow enough for a pure langevin function [ citing @xcite ] to be observed  the calculation [ of the langevin function ] can now be said to have been confirmed by direct experiment .",
    "of course , a langevin function ( or any other similar function ) can _ always _ be fitted to such data for a rather narrow temperature range [ citing @xcite ] , but the remarkably narrow distribution of [ @xcite ] can be fitted to such a function over a _ wide _ temperature range . in this respect",
    "this experiment is still quite unique in the literature '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "earlier @xcite , aharoni asserts : `` and there is no mistake in this algebra : there are only two differences between this calculation [ of the langevin function ] and the study of a gas of paramagnetic atoms in section 2.1 [ yielding the brillouin function ] .",
    "one is that the function @xmath65 [ the angle to the fixed magnetic field ] is continuous here , while this variable had discrete values in section 2.1 and the other is that the magnetic moment @xmath66 was that of a single atom there , while here it is the moment of a large number of atoms , coupled together .",
    "however , the second difference is only quantitative and not qualitative , and the first one should not make any difference , especially since the energy levels of a large spin number @xmath67 are very close together , and look like a continuous variable .",
    "it is thus _ true _ that if there was no other energy term besides the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian , it would have been impossible to measure any magnetism in zero applied field , and there would be no meaning to a curie termperature , or critical exponents , or any of the other nice features mentioned in the previous chapters .",
    "theorists who calculate these properties never pay attention to the fact that the possibility of measuring that which they calculate is only due to an extra energy term , which they always leave out .",
    "of course , a magnetization as in [ the langevin function ] , which is zero in zero applied field , contradicts not only experiments  it is also in conflict with everyday experience ",
    "it is because real magnetic materials are not isotropic , and not all values of the angle @xmath65 are equally probable . ''",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the brillouin and langevin functions are both instances ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively ) of the two - spin correlation function of the @xmath70-vector model ( of isotropically - interacting @xmath70-dimensional classical spins ) for a one - dimensional lattice ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.3 ) , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "we now discuss the manner in which our first reported result ( [ principal ] ) was derived . to begin with",
    ", we noted that bloore @xcite had suggested the transformations ( `` to suppress the dependence on [ the diagonal entries ] @xmath73 and @xmath16 by scaling the [ off - diagonal ] variables @xmath74 '' ) , @xmath75 the positivity conditions on the density matrix @xmath76 , then , took the form ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 15 ) ) , @xmath77 were simply real ( that is , @xmath78 ) , then , the last condition could be rewritten as @xmath79 then , by the rotation of the ( @xmath80)-pair of axes through an angle of @xmath81 and the ( @xmath82)-pair of axes , similarly , the allowed values of @xmath83 could be seen to lie inside a four - dimensional _ spheroid _ , two of the principal axes of which had a length equal to @xmath84 and the other two , @xmath85 ( so the spheroid is neither predominantly `` oblate '' nor `` prolate '' in character ) .",
    "bloore s argument easily extends  using two additional identical rotations , not now necessarily however , equal to @xmath81  to the general case , in which @xmath86 is complex . ( if we were to single out @xmath87 , say , rather than @xmath86 , we would obtain an analogue of ( [ principal ] ) , containing @xmath15 , not @xmath14 , as its distinguished variable among @xmath73 and @xmath16 . )",
    "we proceed onward by converting to polar coordinates , @xmath88 .",
    "then , we rotate two of the six pairs formed by the four axes obtained by the two @xmath81-rotations  each new pair being comprised of one member from each of the two pairs resulting from the @xmath81-rotations suggested by bloore . the two new angles of rotation now both equal @xmath89 .",
    "we have , after performing the four indicated rotations , transformed the resultant set of axes ( @xmath90 ) , using a set of four `` hyperspheroidal '' coordinates ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 @xmath93 the jacobian of the total transformation ( the scaling transformations ( [ transformations ] ) , the four rotations of pairs of axes , along with the introduction of polar and hyperspheroidal coordinates ) is , @xmath94 in the new variables , the determinant of the @xmath5 density matrix @xmath76 takes the simple form ( being free of the four angular variables  @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 ) of the operators of left ( @xmath97 ) and right multiplication ( @xmath98 ) for the _ minimal _ monotone metric .",
    "he had noted that for the @xmath1 density matrices , in general , these @xmath99 eigenvalues would be of the form @xmath100 @xmath101 , where the @xmath102 @xmath103 are the eigenvalues of @xmath76 itself . then , we observed @xcite ( cf .",
    "* eq . ( 24 ) ) )  making use of the fact that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of eigenvalues of the matrix  that the corresponding volume element would be proportional to the _ square root _ of the determinant of ( @xmath104 ( or , equivalently , to the reciprocal of the square root of the determinant of @xmath105 ) .",
    "we adopted this line of argument to the maximal monotone case by replacing the sums @xmath106 by ( twice ) the corresponding _ harmonic means _",
    "( @xmath107 ) @xcite .",
    "then , the volume element of the maximal monotone metric can be shown to be proportional to the product of @xmath108 and a term @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes @xcite the sum of the three principal minors of order two of @xmath76 .",
    "( the spin-@xmath111 counterpart of this product  yielded by the analogous argument , as well by an independent one ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 3.17 ) )  is simply @xmath112 . ) for the minimal monotone metric in the spin-1 case , on the other hand , the volume element  now based on the terms @xmath113  is proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "the occurrence of the term @xmath109 in the _ denominator _ of the integrand  and not the numerator , as in the spin-1 maximal monotone case  results in a substantially more difficult multiple integration ( cf .",
    "( [ fullintegration ] ) ) , for which we have been able to exactly integrate over the variables @xmath115 , leaving us with an expression containing an elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "however , further attempts to use numerical methods for this five - variable expression have so far not been successful .",
    "the spin-@xmath6 form of the volume element for the minimal monotone metric is proportional to @xmath116 .",
    "its use for thermodynamical purposes , led @xcite to a somewhat different ratio ( cf .",
    "[ stanley ] ) , -@xmath117 , of modified bessel functions , than the negative of the langevin function ( [ langevin ] ) , which is expressible @xcite as -@xmath118 . ( brody and hughston @xcite had , first , arrived at the former ratio , but then @xcite [ personal communication ] , by using `` phase space volume '' rather than `` state density [ i. e. , weighted volume ] '' , concluded that the latter ratio was more appropriate .",
    "however , for higher dimensional cases  spin-1 , the case under investigation here , being the simplest such  brody and hughston @xcite stated that `` the energy surfaces are not fully ergodic with respect to the schrdinger equation , and thus we can not expect to be able to deduce the microcanonical postulate directly from the basic principles of quantum mechanics . '' ) so , it can be seen that as we pass from the spin-@xmath6 case to the spin-1 situation , for both the minimal and maximal monotone metrics , we have to deal with an additional term ( besides a certain power of @xmath119 ) of the form , @xmath120 , to some power .    to find the bivariate marginal probability distribution ( [ principal ] ) , we first performed the eightfold multiple integration ( using the trace condition to set @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 then , we ( following established bayesian principles for dealing with nonnormalizable prior distributions @xcite ) took the ratio of the outcome of the ( initial sixfold ) integration  that is , after all but the last two stages ( over @xmath14 and @xmath15 )  to the result of the complete integration . in the _",
    "limit , @xmath123 , the ratio converges to the probability distribution ( [ principal ] ) over the two - dimensional simplex .",
    "( the result was invariant when the order in which the limits were taken was reversed . )",
    "this computational strategy was made necessary due to the fact that the integration diverged if we directly used the naive upper limits , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , evident from ( [ determinant ] ) .",
    "a similar approach had been required ( due to divergence also ) in the spin-@xmath6 case , based on the maximal monotone metric ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 43)-(46 ) ) . there , the corresponding volume element ( @xmath126 ) was integrated over a three - dimensional ball of radius @xmath127 . as @xmath128 ,",
    "this ball coincides with the `` bloch sphere '' ( unit ball ) of spin-@xmath6 systems .",
    "a bivariate marginal probability distribution was then obtainable by taking the limit @xmath129 of a certain ratio  with the resultant univariate distribution simply being uniform in nature , and leading , when adopted as the density - of - states , to the langevin model ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "since it has been argued elsewhere @xcite that of all the possible monotone metrics , the maximal one is the _ most noninformative _ in character , it would seem plausible that the maximal metric might be singled out to provide density - of - states ( structure ) functions for thermodynamic analyses .",
    "( for additional results pertinent  in the context of `` universal quantum coding ''  to comparative properties of the maximal and monotone metrics , see @xcite . )",
    "we would also like to report a success in performing the eightfold multiple integration in ( [ fullintegration ] ) , after reordering the individual integrations so that the ones over @xmath130 and @xmath131  rather than @xmath132 and @xmath133  were performed first .",
    "then , we were able to compute the limit of the ratio of the result after the first _ two _ integrations to the complete eightfold integration .",
    "this gives us a _",
    "six_-dimensional marginal probability distribution ( free of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and independent of the particular values of @xmath134 and @xmath133 ) , @xmath135 one of the two - dimensional marginal probability distributions of ( [ end ] )  the one over the simplex spanned by the three diagonal entries ( @xmath136 ) of the density matrix ( [ blooremat ] )  is our earlier result ( [ principal ] ) .",
    "the focus of the study here has been on the application of _ symbolic _ integration to the modeling of the thermodynamics properties of spin-1 systems . with the application of _ numerical _ integration methods ,",
    "however , we might hope to broaden our work to encompass _",
    "non_-diagonal hamiltonians ( such as @xmath137 ) .",
    "let us proceed with a `` strong equilibrium '' analysis @xcite of the non - diagonal observable , @xmath139 ( it would appear that all our conclusions of a thermodynamic nature should be precisely the same for the other five non - diagonal observables , as well . )",
    "rather than considering the full eight - dimensional convex set of @xmath5 density matrices , however , we restrict our considerations to the two - dimensional convex set of @xmath5 density matrices which _ commute _ with @xmath138  so , we are considering the case of `` strong equilibrium '' @xcite .",
    "we , then , assign the volume element of the bures ( minimal monotone ) metric to this set ( using formula ( 10 ) in @xcite ) , as a density - of - states .",
    "( since the set is composed of commuting matrices , we are in a _ classical _ situation in which there is a _ unique _",

    "the @xmath5 density matrix ( [ blooremat ] ) can be considered to be embedded in the upper left corner of the @xmath1 density matrix .",

    "the three pairs of equal eigenvalues of this matrix are given by the solution of the _ cubic _ equation , @xmath148 there does not appear to be any very simple general form for the three roots of this equation .",
    "( in principle , we are able to diagonalize the @xmath147 matrix , but the computations required to fully implement the associated transformations of the six variables , seem to be quite daunting . ) however , if we set the factor ( @xmath149 ) to zero ( which can be accomplished by taking either @xmath150 or @xmath151 to be zero ) , then the three roots are of the form @xmath152 where @xmath153 if we set the factor to be -3 ( by taking both @xmath150 and @xmath151 to be @xmath154 ) , then the roots are @xmath155 where now @xmath156",
    "the situation becomes simpler still if we set the parameter @xmath131 to zero ( so that the @xmath46 submatrix of ( [ blooremat ] ) in the upper left corner is diagonal in nature ) .",
    "then , the three roots are @xmath157,@xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath160 , the roots are @xmath161,@xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "if we set @xmath164 ( corresponding to a pure state ) , two of the roots are zero and the third is @xmath165 ) . for @xmath166 , there are also two zero roots and one equalling @xmath167 .",
    "let us proceed to analyze in detail the case @xmath160 , for which the three eigenvalues , as just noted , are @xmath161,@xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "setting @xmath130 to zero is equivalent ( cf .",
    "( [ coord ] ) ) to nullifying the entries @xmath168 and @xmath169 in ( [ bleeremat ] ) , so the scenario is eleven - dimensional in nature .",
    "we have found the eigenvectors corresponding to these three eigenvalues , that is , for ( @xmath161 ) , @xmath170 for ( @xmath162 ) , @xmath171 and for ( @xmath163 ) , @xmath172 we transformed the three complex variables @xmath173 and @xmath174 , on the basis of these eigenvectors , to a new set of six real variables ( @xmath175 ) , between which there are no nonzero cross - product terms in the determinant of the transformed matrix .",
    "then , we employed a six - dimensional version of spheroidal coordinates ( @xmath176 ) ( cf .",
    "( [ coord ] ) ) , @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 the determinant becomes , then , simply @xmath180 . the jacobian corresponding to the sequence of transformations is ( cf .",
    "( [ jacobian ] ) ) @xmath181      the integrand based on the maximal monotone metric is ( employing once again our _ ansatz _ based on the work of dittmann @xcite , in which we replace the _ arithmetic _ means of the eigenvalues by their _ harmonic _ means , in accordance with the corresponding morozova - chentsov functions ) , the product of this jacobian and the ratio of the term ( @xmath182 ) to @xmath183 , where @xmath110 is the sum of the six principal minors of order two and @xmath184 is the sum of the four principal minors of order three .",
    "we performed the integration over the eleven - dimensional convex set , the innermost integrations being over @xmath185 from 0 to @xmath186 , and @xmath131 from 0 to @xmath67 .",
    "( the integration would diverge if we were simply to set either @xmath67 or @xmath186 to 1 . ) then , we were able to integrate over the six angular variables ( @xmath187 s ) , but not fully over the three - dimensional simplex spanned by the diagonal entries ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the problem , in this regard , seems attributable to the fact that the powers of @xmath73 and @xmath16  but not @xmath189  in the jacobian ( [ jacobian2 ] ) are all less than three .",
    "if all four powers were , in fact , equal to three , then dividing by @xmath190 , with @xmath191 , would yield a term of the form @xmath192  similar to the term @xmath193 , encountered in the successful spin-1 analysis above  which would be integrable over the simplex .",
    "( we would , in fact , obtain such a desirable term if we could otherwise proceed with a _ full _ fifteen - dimensional analysis . )",
    "however , we have the resultant term @xmath194 , which appears to be not integrable .",
    "thus , we have not so far been able to extend the form of analysis taken here for the spin-1 systems to the convex set of spin-@xmath45 or , equivalently , coupled spin-@xmath6 systems ( cf .",
    "( following the lead of bloore @xcite , one might also study the presumably simpler case of the nine - dimensional convex set of _ real _ @xmath195 density matrices . )",
    "let us , in the manner of sec .",
    "[ nondiagonal1 ] , restrict our attention to those @xmath195 density matrices which commute with a certain non - diagonal hamiltonian ( so we remain within the framework of `` strong equilibrium '' ) , which we choose here to be @xmath196 then , after assigning the volume element of the bures metric to the three - dimensional convex set of the mutually commuting density matrices , we have found the expected value of the observable ( [ observable4by4 ] ) , as a function of the thermodynamic parameter @xmath53 , to be as indicated in fig .",
    "[ plot4by4 ] .",
    "in this communication , we have sought to pursue a particular chain of reasoning ( which , for spin-@xmath6 systems , is known to yield the langevin function , thus according fully with detailed arguments of lavenda @xcite ) for spin-1 and spin-@xmath45 systems .",
    "the fundamental problems encountered _ en route _ include the derivation of the volume elements of the ( noninformative ) maximal monotone metric ( of the left logarithmic derivative ) for these two scenarios . by applying principles used in bayesian reasoning @xcite",
    ", we have succeeded through extensive analysis and computations in obtaining a six - dimensional marginal probability distribution ( [ end ] ) from the ( nonnormalizable ) volume element for the eight - dimensional convex set of spin-1 systems ( sec .",
    "[ spin1systems ] ) .",
    "we have not been quite as successful , however , in addressing the spin-@xmath45 scenario , in which the corresponding convex set is fifteen - dimensional in nature ( sec .  [ spinspin ] ) .",
    "we are not able to actually demonstrate , but can only conjecture , that our results have physical implications ( cf .",
    "the most questionable and debatable assumption underlying our analysis , perhaps , is that the volume element of the maximal monotone metric can be employed as a density - of - states for thermodynamic purposes .",
    "the initial impetus to pursue this line of research was provided by an extended series of forcefully - argued papers of band and park @xcite . in them , for various conceptual reasons , they expressed dissatisfaction with the conventional ( `` jaynesian '' ) approach to quantum statistical thermodynamics and sought to develop a conceptually superior alternative approach .",
    "we believe that our analysis is quite consistent with the spirit of their work , and serves to implement it for certain low - dimensional scenarios . we have also been encouraged in our work by the detailed remarks of lavenda @xcite , regarding the propriety of using the langevin function for spin-@xmath6 systems , since our methodology , in fact , yields this function .",
    "also , the analyses of brody and hughston @xcite , though differing from ours in several technical respects  in particular , focusing on pure states  possess similar motivations .",
    "it also appears natural that , amongst the _ continuum _ of monotone metrics @xcite , the _ maximal _ one should play the distinguished information - theoretic role we have explored for it , since its _ noninformative _ nature has been independently established @xcite .",
    "the fact that , as a result of lengthy and demanding computations based on the volume element of the maximal monotone metric , we were able to arrive at the quite simple results ( [ principal ] ) and ( [ end ] ) also assists , we believe , in validating the rather unconventional course pursued here .",
