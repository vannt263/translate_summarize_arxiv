    "the low - energy constants ( lec s ) of the effective chiral lagrangian of qcd @xcite are quantities of great theoretical interest , since they reflect the way chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "however , their determination remains a particularly awkward problem . in most cases @xcite , their values",
    "have been inferred from observables for the pseudoscalar mesons , with the help of two assumptions : ( 1 ) the quark condensate is the dominant order parameter to describe the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath3s ) @xcite , and ( 2 ) the pattern of sb@xmath3s agrees correctly with a large-@xmath4 description of qcd @xcite , in which quantum fluctuations are treated as small perturbations .",
    "if we admit both assumptions , the su(2)@xmath5su(2 ) quark condensate @xmath6 should not depend much on the mass of the strange quark .",
    "we could then set the latter to zero with no major effect on the quark condensate : @xmath7 .",
    "we end up with only one large condensate for su(2)@xmath5su(2 ) and su(3)@xmath5su(3 ) chiral limits , which is not very sensitive to @xmath8 fluctuations .",
    "the lec s suppressed by the zweig rule , @xmath9 and @xmath0 , are consistently supposed to be very small when considered at a typical hadronic scale .",
    "however , several arguments may be raised against this `` mean - field approximation '' of sb@xmath3s , in which the zweig rule applies and the chiral structure of qcd vacuum is more or less independent of the number of massless quarks . on the one hand ,",
    "the scalar sector @xmath1 does not comply with large @xmath4-predictions @xcite , and some lattice simulations with dynamical fermions suggest a strong @xmath10-sensitivity of sb@xmath3s signals @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the behaviour of the perturbative qcd @xmath11-function indicates that chiral symmetry should be restored for large enough values of @xmath10 . in the vicinity ot the corresponding critical point",
    ", chiral order parameters should strongly vary with @xmath10 .",
    "various approaches , based on the investigation of the qcd conformal window @xcite , gap equations @xcite , or the instanton liquid model @xcite , have been proposed to investigate the variations of chiral order parameters with the number of massless flavors and to determine the critical value of @xmath10 for the restoration of chiral symmetry .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath10-sensitivity of chiral order parameters has been investigated without relying on perturbative methods , but rather by exploiting particular properties of vector - like gauge theories .",
    "the mechanism of sb@xmath3s is indeed related to the dynamics of the lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator : @xmath12 , considered on an euclidean torus @xcite .",
    "two main chiral order parameters can be expressed in this framework .",
    "the quark condensate @xmath13 is related to the average density of eigenvalues around zero @xcite and the pion decay constant in the chiral limit @xmath14 can be interpreted as a conductivity @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic behaviour of dirac eigenvalues leads to a suppression of both order parameters when the number of flavors increases : @xmath15    this sensitivity of chiral order parameters to light - quark loops is suppressed in the large-@xmath4 limit and is considered as weak for qcd according to the second hypothesis of the standard framework .",
    "however , the @xmath10-dependence of chiral order parameters can be measured by correlators that violate the zweig rule in the scalar ( vacuum ) channel .",
    "for instance , the difference @xmath16 ( and the lec @xmath0 ) is related to the correlator @xmath17 @xcite ( this correlator can be interpreted as fluctuations of the density of dirac eigenvalues @xcite ) .",
    "the large zr violations observed in the @xmath1 channel could therefore support a swift evolution in the chiral structure of the vacuum from @xmath2 to @xmath18 .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of @xmath8 pairs would then play an essential role in the low - energy dynamics of qcd .",
    "hence , it is worth reconsidering the determination of lec s without supposing ( 1 ) the dominance of the quark condensate and ( 2 ) the suppression of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this determination starts with quark mass expansion of measured observables such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) @xcite : @xmath21 +   f_p^2\\delta_p ,   \\label{expfp2mp2}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes formally light quark masses ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and the remainder @xmath26 is of order @xmath27 .",

    "series like eq .",
    "( [ expfp2mp2 ] ) are assumed to converge on the basis of a genuine dimensional estimate @xcite .",
    "the lec s involved in the coefficients are related to green functions of axial and vector currents , and scalar and pseudoscalar densities .",
    "the dimensional estimate consists in saturating the correlators by the exchange of resonances with masses of order @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we obtain coefficients of order @xmath34 for the power @xmath35 .",
    "the quark mass expansion would therefore lead to ( convergent ) series in powers of @xmath36 .",
    "notice that this genuine estimate can not be applied to the linear term @xmath28 corresponding to the quark condensate ( there is no colored physical state to saturate @xmath37 ) .",
    "moreover , the convergence of the whole series does not imply that the linear term @xmath28 is dominant with respect to the quadratic term . in this article , we will precisely address ( 1 ) the possibility of such a competition between the first two orders in the quark mass expansions , and ( 2 ) the implications of large values for the zr - suppressed constants @xmath9 and @xmath0 , in particular for the determination of lec s .",
