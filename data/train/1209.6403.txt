    "superstring theories , widely considered as candidates for a unified theory of all interactions , generically predict the existence of light scalar fields associated with the breaking of scale invariance and the size and shape of the string compactification volume .",
    "one example is the dilaton , a scalar field associated with the scale transformations whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) determines the values of various couplings in the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "string theory compactification radii also appear in the low - energy theory as scalar fields with some very small masses . in a number of models , the string scale @xmath0 is of the order of the reduced planck mass , @xmath1  gev , but , in models with a large compactification volume ,",
    "the scale of @xmath2 is suppressed by the compactification volume and can be much lower  @xcite . although one might expect that interactions of moduli with other fields should be suppressed by a factor that is proportional to some power of @xmath3 , detailed calculations can produce answers that are different from naive dimensional analyses  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is a generic prediction of string theory , but , even aside from string theory , it is a well - motivated concept in its own right .",
    "an appealing generalization of space - time symmetries involving non - commuting fermionic degrees of freedom in the form of a graded algebra leads to supersymmetry and supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "as long as supersymmetry is unbroken , its potential has numerous flat directions with infinitely many degenerate classical vacua .",
    "the degrees of freedom parameterizing these flat directions are massless in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry , but they acquire a mass from the breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "the mass thus acquired is well below the scale at which supersymmetry breaking occurs .",
    "for example , for @xmath4-type breaking , the breaking of supersymmetry by the non - zero vev of @xmath5 can be communicated to the rest of the fields by gravitational interactions suppressed by the ( reduced ) planck mass @xmath3 .",
    "this gives moduli masses of the order of @xmath6 , well below the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the coupling of the moduli to the rest of the fields is also suppressed by the higher scale .",
    "massless in the limit of exact supersymmetry , the moduli acquire some masses from supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the range of moduli masses is model - dependent , and a lighter scalar with mass well below a kev would not be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "however , the recent discovery of a 125  gev higgs boson  @xcite points to the moduli masses above 1  kev , which further strengthens the motivation for investigating moduli as a viable dark - matter candidate .    in the following section we directly address the moduli problem , and our approach is based on a low - scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , we consider the gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario .",
    "the breaking of supersymmetry occurs via a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the f - component @xmath7 of some chiral superfield @xmath8 , whose scalar component also has a non - zero vev @xmath9 .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is then communicated to the visible sector by messengers @xmath10 . the messengers couple to @xmath8 with couplings @xmath11 , @xmath12 in what follows",
    "we suppress the indices as we discuss the generic features of a class of models .",
    "the mass - squared matrix of the scalar messengers takes the form @xmath13 the stability condition requires that this matrix have no negative eigenvalues , which implies @xmath14 in the visible sector , the squarks acquire masses through the gauge interactions involving the messengers in the loops . up to some group",
    "theoretical factors of order one , these masses are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the su(3 ) gauge coupling constant of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the recent discovery of the higgs boson with mass 125  gev significantly tightens the allowed range of parameters for the squark masses . according to the analysis of  @xcite",
    ", a mass of 125  gev requires that the squarks be heavier than 10  tev .",
    "the constraint @xmath17 combined with eq .",
    "( [ msq ] ) , the stability constraint eq .",
    "( [ stability ] ) , and the requirement that @xmath18 implies the following lower limit on the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath19 we note that @xmath20 in the case of direct mediation  @xcite .",
    "this lower bound on the supersymmetry breaking scale implies the following lower bound on the mass of the moduli : @xmath21 some moduli can get larger masses , for example , if they couple directly to the gauge fields in the hidden sector , where gaugino condensation takes place .",
    "however , it is likely that some moduli remain massless until supersymmetry is broken and get masses of the order of the gravitino mass in eq .",
    "( [ kevmass ] ) by gravity mediation .",
    "we will focus on such moduli .",
    "some additional constraints arise from the requirement of not over - producing dark matter in the form of gravitinos , which have a similar mass . for",
    "masses in the several kev range the gravitinos come into thermal equilibrium and reach thermal abundances at temperatures above tev , and the total amount of dark matter would be unacceptably large if no dilution occurred . however , gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models contain candidate particles whose out - of - equilibrium decay can produce entropy and dilute the population of dark matter to an acceptable level  @xcite .",
    "the required dilution factor @xmath22 is proportional to the mass , @xmath23  @xcite . for masses above 1  mev",
    ", the requisite dilution of @xmath24 can be difficult to reconcile with leptogenesis because the baryon asymmetry is diluted by the same factor .",
    "for masses below ( but not too far below ) 1  mev the dilution can still be efficient , and the gravitino abundance well below the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "as we discuss below , the moduli generally tend to be over - produced , but anthropic selection considerations point to abundances in the range of observational estimates of the dark matter density . since the same anthropic reasoning would not work for the gravitinos , one can assume that the moduli have a greater abundance than the gravitinos .",
    "it is also possible that the contributions of the moduli and the gravitinos are comparable .",
    "the intriguing possibility that dark matter is composed of two separate components with different free - streaming properties , which can have some observable effects on the small scales , was discussed in detail  @xcite in connection with sterile neutrinos produced by two distinct mechanisms  @xcite . in our case",
    ", there is an analogous possibility that dark matter is comprised of two components , namely , the moduli and the gravitinos .",
    "taking into account the higgs boson mass and the gravitino constraints , the moduli masses of interest lie in the range @xmath25  kev .",
    "as discussed above , a number of independent arguments based on well - motivated theories converge on the prediction of light scalar fields coupled very weakly to the remaining fields in the theory .",
    "the relevant masses range from a few ev to well above the electroweak scale .",
    "the lighter moduli can decay through interactions suppressed by an effective high energy scale @xmath26 into photons and neutrinos .",
    "typically , the dominant decay channel is @xmath27 through a coupling @xmath28 where we have defined a parameter @xmath29 , @xmath30 choosing @xmath29 and @xmath26 so as to parameterize the coupling in a model - independent way . @xmath26 and the corresponding parameter @xmath29 have specific meanings in the context of specific models .",
    "for example , for string moduli , @xmath26 can be related to the string compactification scale and structure .",
    "explicit calculations yield values of @xmath29 ranging from @xmath31  @xcite to much larger values  @xcite .    the rate of moduli radiative decay is @xmath32 the generic prediction of light scalar fields gives rise to a very serious cosmological problem , namely the moduli problem .",
    "there is strong and growing evidence that the universe has undergone a period of inflation that resulted in flatness and homogeneity of the observed universe , and that generated the observed spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "if mass @xmath33 is smaller than the hubble constant @xmath34 during inflation , then the vacuum expectation value of the light scalar field during inflation can be very large for the following reason .",
    "one expects the energy density in each scalar field to be of the order of @xmath35 , that is @xmath36 , during inflation .",
    "hence , the vev @xmath37 , on average ( i.e. , averaged over superhorizon scales ) , takes a very large value .",
    "furthermore , the value of the ground - state vev is not well defined . during inflation ,",
    "the minimum of the potential for the @xmath38 field can differ from its zero - temperature value due to the terms associated with supersymmetry breaking in de  sitter space , i.e. , due to expansion of the universe .",
    "these terms , coming from the khler potential , act as additional mass terms @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant of order 1 that can be positive or negative  @xcite .",
    "these contributions overwhelm the small moduli masses and can displace the vev of the field by a large amount . when inflation is finished , and reheating commences , the vevs of the moduli fields are stuck at some values far from the minima of their respective potentials .",
    "eventually the hubble constant @xmath34 approaches the mass @xmath33 ; and , only then can the field start oscillating .",
    "however , the minimum of the effective potential , which includes the expansion - induced contributions , can still differ from the zero temperature minimum , they are bound to resume when @xmath34 decreases further because the minimum of the effective potential depends on @xmath34  @xcite . ] .",
    "a scalar field with some vanishingly small couplings to the lighter particles oscillates until the time @xmath41 during this time , the field s cosmological behavior is identical to that of non - relativistic matter , with energy density declining with scale factor @xmath42 as @xmath43 . when the radiation density that scales as @xmath44 drops below the energy density of moduli , the universe enters a prolonged period of matter dominated expansion , at the end of which moduli decay .",
    "this causes a variety of cosmological problems , depending on the moduli mass and decay width .    if moduli decay before big - bang nucleosynthesis , their decay products thermalize and they do not cause a conflict with observations , assuming that the baryon asymmetry of the universe is not diluted away",
    "it is possible to generate the baryon asymmetry through affleck ",
    "dine baryogenesis  @xcite so as to compensate for dilution .",
    "masses @xmath33 above @xmath45  tev may be considered `` safe '' in this sense .",
    "if the moduli decay during big - bang nucleosynthesis , the entropy release may still be consistent with successful nucleosynthesis , and the additional entropy released may account for the small observed deviation of the effective number of light species from the standard model prediction  @xcite .",
    "this case requires further investigation .",
    "moduli decay after nucleosynthesis , but before recombination , unacceptably dilutes the baryon density .",
    "decay after recombination also distorts the cosmic diffuse microwave , and contributes to the x- and gamma - ray , backgrounds in violation of observational constraints for some combinations of abundance and mass  @xcite , although cosmologically significant densities are not excluded for @xmath46  kev  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "although decay times longer than the age of the universe are consistent with the moduli being the dark matter if they can be produced with the correct abundance , naive estimates for moduli dark matter abundance in this case predict a much greater value than the observed dark matter density . indeed , let us estimate the energy density of the universe when the modulus @xmath38 starts oscillating , that is , when @xmath47 , or when the temperature of the universe is @xmath48 the density to entropy ratio is @xmath49 comparing this ratio , corrected for the entropy production , with today s value , @xmath50 clearly reveals a drastic discrepancy .    with the help of thermal inflation  @xcite , or by means of coupling the moduli fields to the inflaton  @xcite the moduli problem can be ameliorated in some range of masses  @xcite .",
    "however , neither of these approaches provides a complete solution .",
    "as long as the moduli are long - lived , anthropic selection may be invoked to explain why moduli dark matter in the observed part of the universe is present in the right amount , circumventing the problem discussed in the previous section of the energy density in the oscillating moduli field taking on an excessively large value .",
    "the moduli problem is eliminated if the initial value @xmath51 of the modulus field is , for whatever reason , sufficiently small that the energy density in the moduli does not significantly exceed the baryonic energy density .",
    "this may be compared with the requirement , realized in the observable universe , for the dark - to - baryonic matter ratio to be @xmath52 in order for conditions amenable to the the formation of stars and planets , and , ultimately , for the existence of life , to be attained  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may simultaneously attempt to explain away the moduli problem and explain the abundance of dark matter based on the anthropic selection : life can only emerge in those parts of the universe where the moduli energy density is sufficiently low that the dark - to - baryonic matter ratio has the acceptable value .",
    "the reasoning here is analogous to that applied to the axion  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the abundance of string moduli depends on the initial value @xmath51 ( eq .  [ rhophitos ] ) that is determined by the vev of the field during inflation . on average , this vev tends to be very large , of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "however the large vev may generate too much matter that is already dominant at a temperature @xmath53  gev .",
    "inflation still assures that @xmath54 , so that the universe remains flat ; however , in this case structure formation proceeds very early , leading to a universe dominated by black holes  @xcite .",
    "if matter comes to dominate the energy density of the universe too early , the density perturbations can grow and become non - linear before recombination . in this case",
    ", baryons and radiation are trapped together inside the collapsing halos , and the baryon coupling to photons maintains the jeans mass at a constant value as the collapse proceeds . as a result , the baryonic matter can not fragment , and large amounts of coupled baryon - radiation fluid are dragged into the potential wells created by clumps of dark matter . as discussed by  @xcite ,",
    "the end result of such a structure formation process is a universe with supermassive black holes , photons , and neutrinos , but without stars and planets .",
    "such a universe is not amenable to life .",
    "for the example in question , the matter - radiation equality would occur at temperature @xmath55    assuming that the baryon asymmetry escapes dilution , baryons are coupled to radiation until @xmath56  ev .",
    "linear growth of density perturbations may commence as early as at redshift @xmath57 allowing for a longer epoch of growth in cosmological perturbations . in the observed universe ,",
    "primordial perturbations of the order of @xmath58 are consistent with the data . however , in the universe with matter domination starting as early as redshift @xmath57 , these perturbations would have gone non - linear long before recombination leading to universe dominated by black holes and not stars and planets capable of hosting life .",
    "in fact , even the overdensities as small as @xmath59 would have gone non - linear in this case .",
    "the possibility of starting with very small density perturbations , @xmath60 are disfavored by some anthropic arguments as well .",
    "the constraints arise from a combination of several astrophysical bounds summarized in table  4 and fig .",
    "12 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows the anthropicly allowed range as a function of @xmath61 and matter density per cmb photon .",
    "there one finds no viable possibility for @xmath62 and any matter density . likewise , there is no viable scenario for any value of @xmath61 for large dark matter densities .",
    "we conclude that life is impossible in a universe where the dark matter density exceeds the baryon density by many orders of magnitude , and we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "while the  most common  values of the initial field @xmath38 produce universes without stars or planets , inflation does allow for some relatively small part of the volume to have @xmath63 .",
    "the probability of this happening at any given point in de  sitter space is negligible , but the _ conditional _ probability of a small vev , under the condition that life can evolve and produce an observer , is actually of the order of 1 because life is highly improbable in the large - vev regions .",
    "hence , anthropic selection would favor @xmath64 , near the boundary of the parameter space acceptable for the existence of life .",
    "this motivates the search for dark matter in the form of string moduli with masses below 1  mev and for decay widths corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "cosmological data limits the lifetime of dark matter to @xmath66  s in the case of radiative decays  @xcite ( and @xmath67s for general decays  @xcite ) . based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , this corresponds to sub - mev masses .",
    "in particular , one can search for the dark matter in the form of moduli using x - ray telescopes .",
    "the decay of moduli into two photons presents an opportunity for a possible discovery using x - ray telescopes .",
    "since this is a two - body decay , the signal is a very narrow line , whose width is determined by the doppler broadening due to the motion of the dark matter particles .",
    "the energy of a photon is ( 1/2 ) of the particle mass .",
    "if such a line is detected by the x - ray telescopes from compact astrophysical objects with substantial dark mater content and/or from diffuse radiation due to the galactic and cosmological distributions of dark matter , the wavelength of the line will provide a measurement of the dark - matter particle mass .",
    "the identity of the dark matter will still require some additional data , because moduli are not the only dark matter particles capable of producing an x - ray line .",
    "for example , sterile neutrinos , which can also be dark matter  @xcite , are also expected to produce a line from their decay . therefore , a discovery of an x - ray line from sources correlated with the dark matter distribution would reveal the mass of the dark matter particle , but not necessarily its identity .    in this section",
    "we will assume that moduli make up 100% of dark matter .",
    "if dark matter comprises two or more components , and moduli make up fraction @xmath68 , the constraints derived for the decay width @xmath69 should be applied instead to the product @xmath70 , and those on @xmath29 to @xmath71 .      as a proof of concept ,",
    "we derive limits on the moduli decay rate in the soft x - ray energy band ( @xmath72  kev ) , based on observations of the ursa minor and draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies conducted using the _ suzaku _ x - ray observatory .",
    "these data were obtained as part of a search for dark matter in the form of sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using _ suzaku _ data , as detailed in @xcite , lies in the low and stable internal background of the _ suzaku _ xis ( x - ray imaging spectrometer ) ccd detectors that , in combination with its sharp ( by x - ray ccd standards ) energy resolution , provides a robust and relatively sensitive capability for detecting faint spectral features over a broad ( soft x - ray ) bandpass .",
    "the motivation for targeting dwarf spheroidal galaxies is based on their proximity , high dark matter density , and absence of competing x - ray sources  @xcite .",
    "the ursa minor and draco systems , that have among the highest known dark matter surface densities  @xcite , remain the only dwarf spheroidals observed by _",
