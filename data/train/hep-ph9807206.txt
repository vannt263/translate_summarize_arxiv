    "what can cause such an asymptotic behavior for @xmath51 , which contains the pieces in the current  current correlation that is gauge invariant by themselves , is a worthy topic to be further investigated .",
    "it is however a quite unlikely scenario since , as it is discussed in the section [ sec : large - e - and - gdh ] , it violates the requirements of a superselection rule for physical states in the em gauge theory if the regge asymptotics is assumed to be correct for physical amplitudes .",
    "what has not been answered in this paper is how can a would - be goldstone boson corresponding to em gauge symmetry be dynamically generated in a hadronic system .",

    "@xcite from chiral symmetry point of view .",
    "it was found that empirical facts seem to favor a superconducting nucleon .",
    "it is important to push this idea further in future studies .",
    "the next important question is about the @xmath36 evolution of the sum rule in the @xmath149 region , especially in the isovector sector ( i.e. when the difference between proton and neutron is taken ) where , at large @xmath36 , a sum rule due to bjorken @xcite exists .",

    "it is another one of the interesting questions that deserves to be further investigated .",
    "there were two main questions raised in this paper when it was finished in 1995 . in the first one , the author posed his doubt about the modification of the gdh sum rule by invoking non - commuting abelian charge density operator at equal time , the second is about the author s uncertain about the legitimacy of the use of an infinite momentum frame .",
    "a constructive study of the infinite momentum limit is called for .",
    "there is a recent work @xcite by pantfrder and collaborators , who , apart from others , studied these two problems in the context of electroweak theory in an one loop perturbative scheme .",

    "@xcite ) inside a nucleon or one of these proposed phases for the strong interaction vacuum is close ( in energy density ) to the actual phase of the strong interaction vacuum at least inside a nucleon at the present day conditions .    on the observational side ,",
    "the recently determined sea flavor unsymmetry inside a nucleon by the e866/nusea collaboration @xcite are noticeably smaller than the required unsymmetry derived from the nmc measurement @xcite by assuming the validity of the gottfried sum rule .",
    "an explanation of this genuine violation of the gottfried sum rule was provided long ago @xcite based upon the same mechanism as the one proposed in this work .",
    "the possibility that the mechanism proposed in this work can be utilized to provide a coherent physical picture for us to understand the violation of the gottfried sum rule and the seemingly `` violation of unitarity '' ( by the so called `` hard pomeron '' @xcite ) in high energy deep inelastic scattering between leptons and nucleons in the small bjorken x region observed at hera @xcite and in high energy proton - proton scattering is under investigation @xcite based upon a mechanism of spontaneous partial breaking of local em gauge symmetry .",
    "the comments of ref . @xcite on this work show that its author holds somewhat simplified understanding of this work and the physics of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "first , let us discuss the first erratum that are thought to exist in this work .",
    "the alleged mistake is that @xmath51 in eq .",
    "[ amplitude2 ] should be absent because it is not linearly independent .",
    "this is not true since the matrix elements between two on shell nucleon / antinucleon states with the same _ momentum and spin _ is a set of truncated @xmath151 matrix actually .",
    "but i am talk about the dirac @xmath152 matrix structure for _ compton amplitude _ here , it includes not only the _ on shell _ matrix elements between nucleon / antinucleon states with the same momentum and spin , but also those with the same momentum but _ different spin_. each of the @xmath18 ( @xmath153 ) carry different _ dynamical information _ of the system .",
    "in addition , @xmath51 is different from @xmath46 and @xmath49 in that it contains no non - physical state contributions since it is a gauge invariant piece in itself .",
    "this is discussed in length in this paper . did the author of ref .",
    "@xcite notice that the spin quantum numbers for the initial and final states are different in my equations ?",
    "the confusion of ref .",
    "@xcite starts from my use of the term `` canonical commutator '' which becomes synonymous to the term `` naive commutator '' , which is not manifestly covariant , there .",
    "i admit that the term `` canonical '' may not be the best choice in this case since , as it is apparent in the context of the discussion around it , it really means the covariant part of it generated from the equal - time naive commutation relation for a nucleon _ at rest_.",
    "since its matrix elements between two nucleon states are independent of @xmath35 and @xmath6 , the covariant part of the time - ordered products of two current operators and their commutators can be uniquely identified in any frame .",
    "therefore i can boost the rest frame equation [ asymp2 ] to a large momentum frame and finally let the momentum to approach to infinity .",
    "the @xmath28 term coincides with the term derived from the matrix elements of the naive commutator between nucleon states at rest .",
    "since the naive equal - time commutator between fermion fields will lead us to the same form of current - current commutation relation for any frame , they are not related to one another by a lorentz transformation . in this sense ,",
    "the `` canonical commutator '' of this work is different from the naive commutator of ref .",
    "this is the reason that the piece of the commutator between equal - time em current operators given in eq .",
    "[ commutator1 ] is called `` canonical '' .",
    "but i admit that the quantity called `` tensor charge '' of a nucleon in ref .",
    "@xcite should actually be axial charge of a nucleon .",
    "this is corrected in this version of the paper .",
    "but , non of the results of this work is affected by this change .",
    "there is nothing wrong with using the bjorken - johnson - low ( bjl ) equation @xcite .",
    "the bjl equation relates the high energy behavior of the matrix elements of a naive time - ordered amplitudes between two operators and the equal - time commutator of the same operators .",
    "it is a mathematical equation for all linearly independent components on both side of the equation .",
    "the use of it is to get the left hand side by knowing the right hand side and vice versa . in the case of this work",
    ", i happen to know one ( linearly independent ) piece of covariant part of the commutator , which is unique , but do not know the high energy behavior of the corresponding piece in the time - ordered product .",
    "but nothing is wrong with it , is nt it ?",
    "it is not the authentic operational bjl techniques ( bjl procedure ) , but the formal mathematical bjl equation .",
    "the bjl techniques defines the @xmath35 dependent ( polynomial ) parts of commutator for physical amplitudes .",
    "it is actually a well founded assumption .",
    "it was applied successfully in the study of anomalies which was experimentally tested .    in a free theory",
    ", it can be checked straight forwardly that @xmath154 so the contribution of the _ pair states are expected to be suppressed or , in a less favorable case , cancellable , in the infinite momentum limit _ in the same way as the one demonstrated in ref @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the normal procedure , it is safe to take the infinite momentum limit @xcite . the author of ref .",
    "@xcite uses the discussion concerning @xmath155 in the section 4.4.4 of that reference to substantiate his claims .",
    "but the sum rules that i was talking about is an equation , adding and subtracting the _ same quantity _ ( seagull or schwinger terms ) to an equation does not alter the content of that equation .",
    "@xcite suggesting that the leading @xmath27 dependence involved in the gdh sum rule are generated by @xmath28 term so that the troubling `` pair term '' contributions to the naive time - order product and the equal - time commutator are in fact not get canceled ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the infinite momentum limit ? this seems to invalid the its main conclusion .",
    "i am puzzled and invite a new ( formal or informal ) paper from its author to clarify this !",
    "the question related to the violation of the burkhardt ",
    "cottingham ( bc ) sum rule .",
    "the bc sum rule was derived based upon a superconvergence relation @xmath156 with an implicit assumption that the em gauge symmetry is unbroken .",
    "but i am assuming that the em gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken here !",
    "[ bcsum ] is not experimentally direct testable , so no one know whether it is correct or not at the present .",
    "but the current potentially testable version of the bc sum rule , namely , @xmath157 is not expected to be essentially altered by an infinite amount in the deeply inelastic region since eq .",
    "[ bcsum1 ] is an equation for the imaginary part of @xmath158 which suppresses the contributions from the unphysical states in the spontaneously broken phase of em .    finally about the question of whether @xmath66 should be taken or @xmath48 should be taken . from a mathematical sense ,",
    "the set of points that makes @xmath159 denoted by @xmath48 in ref .",
    "@xcite has a zero measure .",
    "this mathematical isolated point is therefore unphysical and can be removed from the physical @xmath36 axis .",

    "in fact his @xmath160 which approaches to zero in the _ infinite momentum limit_.      in conclusion , the relevant theoretical reasons provided in ref .",
    "@xcite in support of its author s disbelief of the modifications of gdh sum rule proposed in this work are either inconsistent with the `` good part '' of this reference , which actually demonstrated the cancellation of pair state contributions to the gdh sum rule in a perturbative way using the standard electroweak model , or is originated from a misunderstanding of the issue .",
