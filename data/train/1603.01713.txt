    "craniospinal irradiation is a technically challenging task .",
    "the length of the planning target volume ( ptv ) exceeds the maximal size of a treatment field , thus requiring some method of combining treatment fields to treat the whole target . while the standard set - up for craniospinal irradiation is still based on the set - up described by van dyk almost 40 years ago @xcite , other modalities such as intensity modulated radiation therapy ( imrt ) @xcite , volumetric modulated arc therapy ( vmat ) @xcite , tomotherapy @xcite , and proton therapy @xcite are increasingly being examined as a possibility for cranio - spinal irradiation .",
    "the studies seem to agree that both imrt and vmat treatment planning offer both a more conformal and a more homogeneous dose coverage of the target and better sparing of some organs at risk ( e.g. , thyroid gland ) with respect to the traditional 3d  crt approach , while at the same time they raise concern about the increased dose to other organs at risk , in particular lungs and kidneys .",
    "a particular problem in the craniospinal irradiation are the field junctions .",
    "set - up inaccuracies of a few milimeters in the cranio - caudal direction can result in large over- or underdosing . in conventional set - up , moving the treatment field junction after a given dose , usually every 9  gy , has been adopted both for reducing dose inhomogeneity and to minimise over- or underdosing which can occur due to systematic errors ; the technique is known as `` feathering '' @xcite .",
    "studies using imrt employ a variety of field - junction techniques : `` hybrid '' junction @xcite , `` jagged - junction '' @xcite , and field overlap @xcite techniques , while studies using vmat use almost exclusively the field overlap technique @xcite , relying on the optimiser algorithm to arrive at a smooth field overlap junction .",
    "in the present study , we focus exclusively on the field junction area .",
    "we show that a wider field junction can result in a smaller dosimetric impact of a given positional error .",
    "we also demonstrate that , left to itself , the dose optimiser algorithm may not arrive at a dose profile which is the most robust towards small positional errors in patient set - up . finally , we present a treatment planning procedure which reduces the dosimetric impact of positional errors .",
    "we start by showing that in two overlapping treatment fields , a linear ramp is the dose profile which yields hot- and cold spots of the smallest magnitude when one field is displaced by a small amount with respect to the other . denoting dose contributions of the two treatment fields by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , we are interested in the deviation of the sum of both contributions from unity , with one field being displaced by @xmath9 : @xmath10 when the displacement @xmath11 is small , we may expand the above difference in a taylor series and , retaining only the linear term in @xmath11 , we obtain : @xmath12 thus , at a given shift @xmath11 , dose deviation is proportional to the dose gradient @xmath13 .",
    "of all the functions raising from 0 to 1 over the distance @xmath14 , the linear function has the smallest maximal gradient .",
    "another quantity of interest would be the average deviation of the dose from unity across the field junction : @xmath15 \\mathrm{d}x & \\approx     \\frac{\\delta x}{l } \\int_0^l f'(x ) \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\\\    & = \\frac{\\delta x}{l } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , for small displacements , when @xmath16 holds and terms in @xmath17 higher than linear can be neglected , the shape of dose profile only affects the magnitude of hot- and cold spots , but not the average dose deviation .",
    "[ fig : field - junction - delta ] shows the dose profile across a field junction in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are represented by linear ramps , one of them shifted with respect to the other .",
    "the contributions of the two overlapping groups of fields ( with vmat , a group of fields is usually a pair of arc fields ; with imrt it is usually 57 fields )  @xmath0 and @xmath1  are shown in red and green , respectively , and the total dose shown in blue . in this simplified example , we arrive at the same expression for dose deviation @xmath18 : @xmath19 as an illustration , a 5  mm positional shift is expected to result in a 5% dose difference across a 10  cm field junction .",
    "the ratio @xmath20 is the dose gradient .     of one dose contribution with respect to the other results in a dose difference of @xmath18 .",
    "]      an adolescent female patient ( 18  yo ) was selected as a test case .",
    "the patient had undergone ct simulation in supine position with the head and shoulders immobilised in a thermoplastic mask and the arms resting comfortably at the patient s sides .",
    "ptv encompassed the whole brain and spinal cord down to s2 vertebra , resulting in a total length of 75.9  cm .",
    "the prescribed dose to this target was 30.6  gy in 17 fractions .",
    "treatment planning was done on eclipse 10.0 treatment planning system , with varian unique performance equipped with millenium mlc 120 and exact igrt couch as the target treatment machine ( varian medical systems , palo alto , ca , usa ) .",
    "the treatment plans were generated using progressive resolution optimiser algorithm pro3 @xcite , and the dose was computed with the analytical anisotropic algorithm ( aaa ) using 2.5  mm calculation grid resolution .    to cover the whole ptv , 3 isocenters in the cranial , upper spinal ( th3 ) and lower spinal ( l2 ) region were chosen , with 23  cm separating the cranial and the upper spinal isocenters , and 26  cm separating both spinal isocenters . to simplify patient positioning , the coordinates of the three isocenters only differed in the cranio - caudal direction .",
    "the field set - up used by center c in @xcite was adopted , with two partial arcs used at each isocenter , avoiding irradiation from the anterior position by omitting the sector @xmath21@xmath22 , and the collimator rotated to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "dose optimisation was performed in two steps .",
    "the treatment plan for the upper spinal region was made in the first step . within the upper spinal region , a central region ( ptvt ; 14.4  cm )",
    "was defined with a homogeneous dose prescription , surrounded by two 10.8  cm transitional regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aux - struct ] ) .",
    "each of the transitional regions was further divided into 9 subregions , each extending 1.2  cm in the cranio - caudal direction .",
    "the dose prescription in each subregion gradually increased from the periphery towards the center ; i.e. to both outermost subregions ( labelled as 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : aux - struct ] ) a dose of 03.4  gy was prescribed , to the adjecent regions ( 2 ) a dose of 3.46.8  gy was prescribed , and so on , up to the innermost subregions ( 9 ) , to which a dose of 27.230.6  gy was prescribed .",
    "after the treatment plan for the upper spinal region had been optimised , the treatment plans covering the cranial and lower spinal regions were made , taking into account the dose distrubution for the upper spinal region , and filling up the dose to the prescribed value .",
    "a positional error in the cranio - caudal direction was simulated by taking an already optimised plan and making two modifications to it : the isocenter position for the cranial pair of treatment fields was moved 5  mm in the cranial direction , and the isocenter position for the lower spinal pair of fields was moved 5  mm in the caudal direction .",
    "the dose was recalculated while keeping the same monitor unit count . in a complementary simulation , the isocenter position for the cranial pair of treatment fields",
    "was moved 5  mm in the caudal direction , and the isocenter position for the lower spinal pair of fields was moved 5  mm in the cranial direction .",
    "the same procedure was repeated for the positional shifts of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  mm .",
    "the treatment plan was verified using film dosimetry ( gafchromic ebt3 ; ashland , wayne , nj , usa ) .",
    "a radiochromic film was mounted into the slot for film dosimetry in the iba multicube phantom ( iba dosimetry , schwarzenbruck , germany ) , with the phantom turned onto its side so that the film lied in the sagittal plane .",
    "irradiated films were later analysed using a web application for radiochromic film dosimetry ( radiochromic.com , v2.2 ; https://radiochromic.com/ ) @xcite , using a correction for scanner response variability @xcite .",
    "in order to determine the minimum number of segments needed to obtain a smooth linear ramp dose profile in the transition region , we ran a separate experiment . in the dose optimisation step for the treatment field for the upper spinal region , the transitional region ( 17 ct slices , separated 6  mm apart , total length 96  mm ) was divided into either 3 , 4 , 6 , or 9 segments . figure  [ fig : ramp - compare]a shows the dose profile contributed by the upper spinal fields to the spinal - spinal junction . figure  [ fig : ramp - compare]b shows the distribution of dose gradient along the transitional region for the above mentioned segmentations , presented as box plots .",
    "a linear ramp has a uniform slope of 100%/96  mm , or 10.4%/cm .",
    "one can see that increasing the number of segments leads to a dose profile closer to the desired linear ramp .        for different treatment plans , figs .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]a  l show a dose profile along a line between the same two points in the patient s body , encompassing the spinal - spinal junction .",
    "the contribution of the two upper spinal arc fields ( clockwise and counter - clockwise summed up ) is shown in green , the contribution of the two lower spinal fields is shown in red , and the total dose in blue .",
    "dose profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]a , b have both been obtained by using the progressive resolution optimiser pro3 on two overlapping pairs of vmat fields , the only difference being that in fig .  [",
    "fig : torak - abdom - stik]a , the overlap region is narrow ( 2.5  cm ) , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]b , it is wide ( 12.0  cm ) .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]c shows the dose profile along a linear ramp junction ( 10.4  cm ) described in the previous section .        by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]b , it is clear that simply widening the junction does not result in a significantly smaller dose gradient of either upper or lower spinal field contribution . instead , the dose optimiser algorithm produces a fairly constant total dose across the junction using non - monotonous upper or lower spinal field contributions , each of them still having areas of steep dose gradient .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]c , however , shows that the treatment planning technique presented in the previous section results in a dose profile which is close to the ideal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field - junction - delta ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]d  f show the behaviour of the field junctions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]a  c in a simulated case in which the distance between the isocenters of the upper and lower spinal fields has been increased by 5  mm .",
    "as expected , a large drop in the total dose is observed in the regions where the upper and lower spinal fields have a high dose gradient . in a similar manner ,",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]g  i show the behaviour of the field junctions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]a  c in a simulated case in which the distance between the isocenters of the upper and lower spinal fields has been decreased by 5  mm .",
    "again , a large rise in the total dose is observed in the regions of high dose gradient .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]j  l show the dose distribution along the dose profile line in the junction area for the field junctions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : torak - abdom - stik]a  c .",
    "black lines correspond to no positional shift , red lines to the distance between the isocenters increased by 5  mm , and blue lines to the distance between the isocenters decreased by 5  mm . while a 5  mm shift of one of the fields with respect to the other can result in a @xmath29 change in dose in the case of a narrow junction , this value drops to @xmath30 in the case of a wide junction , and down to @xmath31 in the case of a linear ramp junction .",
    "note this coincides fairly well with the previous estimates for an idealised field junction : as the original treatment plan aimed to cover the target with 95105% of the prescribed dose , a 5  mm positional shift over a 10  cm junction is expected to pull the dose up or down by another 5% , depending on the direction of the shift .",
    "counting merely the percentage of points staying within the @xmath32 $ ] dose range after a @xmath33  mm shift is performed , the linear ramp dose profile does not offer a significant improvement over other dose profiles at comparable junction widths .",
    "a narrow junction clearly shows the worst results , with only 10% and 13% points staying within the prescribed dose range after the the distance between the isocenters increased or decreased by 5  mm , respectively . with a wide junction ,",
    "these values climb up to 73% and 71% , respectively , while in the case of a linear ramp junction , they are 68% and 91% .",
    "thus , while overall a linear ramp junction performs slightly better , we do nt consider this difference as important as the magnitude by which the dose departs from the prescribed range .    for a linear ramp junction ,",
    "the sensitivity of the dose coverage within the transitional area to the magnitude of positional shift has been assessed ( figure  [ fig : displac - dep ] ) . in this experiment , after dose optimisation , the isocenter of the lower spinal treatment field pair was shifted @xmath25 to @xmath28  mm in the cranial or caudal direction , and the dose was recalculated .",
    "dose distribution within the transitional area of the spinal - spinal junction is shown as a box plot .",
    "one can see that a positional shift up to @xmath26  mm generally leads to dose distributions which are within the @xmath34 $ ] range , which is considered acceptable @xcite , while larger positional shifts , even though they may still yield an acceptable dose distribution in some circumstances , are generally considered unacceptable .          using the whole arc except the sector @xmath35 $ ] for irradiation means irradiating through the patient s arms . while this has been done with suitable immobilisation @xcite , it is generally not advised , because of the dosimetric inaccuracies induced by a non - deliberate change in the patient s arms position . in a separate simulated experiment , we estimated the effect of a complete omission of the patient s arms : after optimising the treatment plan , the same treatment plan was recalculated on another structure set , identical to the original one with the exception of the patient s arms being excluded from the calculation volume .",
    "as expected this produced a slightly higher dose at the same mu value , with @xmath36 for the spinal ptv rising from 101.3% of the prescribed dose to 103.1% of the prescribed dose .",
    "similarly , @xmath37 rose from 94.8% to 96.8% of the prescribed dose , and @xmath38 rose from 104.2% to 107.5% of the prescribed dose .",
    "this is the extreme case ; we can expect that a minor change in position would induce a dosimetric error smaller than this worst - case scenario .",
    "the relatively low impact of arm displacement is consistent with a relatively low dose received by the patient s arms ; even though no special restrictions to the dose in the arms were used , the maximal dose to both humeri stayed at around 10% of the dose prescribed to ptv .",
    "[ fig : multicube - film ] shows the results of treatment plan verification using film dosimetry ; the irradiated film scan ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multicube - film]a ) , the calculated dose ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multicube - film]b ) , the gamma index analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multicube - film]c ) of the match between the dose obtained with the radiochromic film and the dose plane exported from the treatment planning system , and the dose profile across the field overlap region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multicube - film]d ) . for gamma index analysis @xcite ,",
    "3% dose tolerance and 3  mm positional tolerance was used along with a threshold value set at 10% of @xmath39 and global normalization , resulting in the average @xmath40 value of 0.16 and 99.7% points passing @xmath41 criterion .",
    "points with @xmath41 are shown in blue , and points with @xmath42 are shown in red .",
    "while the original set - up for craniospinal irradiation @xcite employed a prone patient position , there are numerous studies advocating the supine patient position @xcite . after judging the advantages and the disadvantages of both set - ups",
    ", we decided to employ it as well .",
    "the obvious advantage of the prone position  easier visualisation of treatment field junctions  became less important with the advancement of image - guided radiotherapy , which made the supine position a viable alternative , allowing for greater patient comfort and easier access for the paediatric patients requiring anaesthesia .      while the studies treating the craniospinal axis using imrt often paid special attention to achieving a desired dose profile in the field junction area ( e.g. , staircase , @xcite ) ,",
    "the studies using vmat usually seem to rely on the dose optimiser to obtain a suitable dose profile . as we have shown earlier",
    ", this often results in non - monotonous dose profiles .    however , a recent study @xcite dealing with the robustness of treatment plans with respect to positional shifts of the patient claims that the authors specifically aimed for a sigmoidal dose profile in the field overlap region . in another study on localization errors @xcite the authors propose a staircase dose profile in order to minimize such errors",
    ". an interesting feature of this study is that the authors actually arrived at a linear ramp profile when the junction region was too narrow to support staircase dose profile ( @xcite , fig .",
    "4a ) , but brushed it off as a mere curiosity without realising that it gives even better results than the technique they propose .",
    "using a linear ramp instead of a staircase dose profile , we predict the @xmath31 spikes observed by myers et al .",
    "( @xcite , fig .  3b , d ) , which correspond to a @xmath43  mm shift applied to a 116  mm overlap region , would drop down to @xmath44 .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have proven that the position shifts in the cranio - caudal direction result in greater dosimetric changes than the shifts in the other two directions .",
    "consequently , we limited our study to the cranio - caudal direction . a comparision of the dosimetric changes reported in @xcite to the ones reported here is difficult for two reasons : ( a ) we examined local effects ( hot- and cold spots ) rather than their influence on the volume - dose histogram , and ( b ) we evaluated the dosimetric impact of the maximal shift , i.e. , @xmath43  mm , while the authors in @xcite chose three random values from the @xmath45 , @xmath46 $ ] range and used their mean and standard deviation . assuming that the samples are distributed uniformly , the mean of several uniform distribution is a rectangular mean distribution , sometimes called bates distribution . for 3 uniformly distributed samples taken from the @xmath47 $ ] , the expected mean and standard deviation is @xmath48 .",
    "it can be argued that this approach better reflects the reality of a clinical department ; however we have deliberately chosen more direct observables which allow for easier analysis .",
    "a 21% increase of the maximum dose reported in @xcite is however close to the expected value of 25% for a 5  mm shift in the cranio - caudal direction applied to a 20  mm overlap region .",
    "craniospinal irradiation , in particular when performed in its conventional set - up , is a technique which leaves little margin for errors . as its requirements are close to the tolerance levels specified in the quality assurance ( qa ) recommendations for medical accelerators , it is important to consider the relevant parameters .",
    "the conventional set - up relies on the jaw position for half - beam block and the treatment couch position ; tolerance levels for them are 1  mm and 2  mm , respectively , both are checked monthly @xcite .    with image - guided techniques , assuring that the imaging system isocenter coincides with the treatment isocenter is of prime importance .",
    "the suggested tolerance levels here are 1.52  mm , checked monthly @xcite .",
    "the inaccuracies introduced by mis - alignment result in systematic errors which do not cancel out by day - to - day variations .",
    "using an idealised schematic field junction with partial field overlap , we have shown that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions : ( a ) widening the field overlap region , and ( b ) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region .",
    "the function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp , and we presented a treatment planning technique for craniospinal irradiation which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields , and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set - up .",
    "the treatment planning technique was developed using vmat , but can be equally well applied to every imrt - derived technique .",

    "<S> [ [ aim ] ] aim + + +    to improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the vmat treatment by ensuring a linear ramp - like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ background ] ] background + + + + + + + + + +    craniospinal irradiation ( csi ) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size , which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields . </S>",
    "<S> volumetric modulated arc therapy ( vmat ) is increasingly being examined for csi , as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ materials - and - methods ] ] materials and methods + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a vmat treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient . </S>",
    "<S> three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used ; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part . in order to assure a ramp - like dose profile in the field overlap region , </S>",
    "<S> the upper spinal part was optimised first , with dose prescription explicitely enforcing a ramp - like dose profile . </S>",
    "<S> the cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards , taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ results ] ] results + + + + + + +    using simple geometrical reasoning , we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions : ( a ) widening the field overlap region , and ( b ) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region . </S>",
    "<S> the function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp . </S>",
    "<S> we present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields , and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set - up .    </S>",
