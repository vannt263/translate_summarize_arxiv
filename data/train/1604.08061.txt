    "the new avenue in modern semiconductor physics has been opened by outstanding experiment performed recently by kazmierczuk _",
    "et al _ @xcite who detected the large quasi particles known as rydberg excitons in natural crystal of copper oxide .",
    "they have observed absorption lines associated with excitons of principal quantum numbers as large as @xmath1 .",
    "one could expect that rydberg excitons would have been described , in analogy to rydberg atoms , by rydberg series of hydrogen atom , but it has turned out that this generic method of description should have been revised .",
    "this is due to the fact that a size of a huge quasi particle , which in fact is a rydberg exciton with high _ n _ , has a diameter more then two micrometers , which is much larger then the wavelength of light needed to create this exciton .",
    "several theoretical approaches to calculate optical properties of rydberg excitons have been presented @xcite@xmath2@xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite developed calculations of of the absorption spectrum on the ground of toyozawa theory and calculated the main parameters for excitonic absorption line for yellow exciton series and emphasized that central - cell corrections have a major influence on the linewidth of the @xmath3-exciton state .",
    "in our recent paper @xcite we have proposed the method based on the real density matrix approach ( rdma ) to obtain the analytical expressions for the optical functions of semiconductor crystals , including a high number of rydberg excitons , taking into account the effect of anisotropic dispersion and the coherence of the electron and hole with the radiation field .",
    "it is expected that the natural direction of development interest in rydberg excitons is focused on stark effect in such systems because this phenomenon may be used for the optical manipulations of excitons if there is an efficient coupling between the radiation field and excitonic systems far from the band edge .",
    "the copper oxide is a perfect candidate for such observations because due to high binding energy of orders of hundred mev and due to their large size , rydberg excitons in cu@xmath00 can exhibit very large electric dipole moments .",
    "these features provide that this system is appropriate to observe stark effect experimentally . in semiconductors where the wannier excitons have a small binding energy ( as , for example , gaas ) , the main effect of the applied electric field is the stark shift of the excitonic resonances and changes in their oscillator strengths ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite for a review ) . in cu@xmath0o which is now the main semiconductor where rydberg excitons are observed , even relatively high excitonic states have a binding energy which is larger than the corresponding ionization energy .",
    "thus the excitonic character of the spectra is conserved , but new phenomena , as for example the appearance of symmetry forbidden states , with positions dependent on the applied field strength and on the state number , are observed  @xcite .",
    "actually , one of the aims of our theoretical paper is to extend the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which allowed to describe optical properties of rydberg excitons , in order to obtain electrooptic functions ( susceptibility , absorption reflection and transmission ) .",
    "our approach has general character because it works for any exciton angular momentum number and for an arbitrary electric field .",
    "in particular , we derive an analytical expression for the electrosusceptibility , from which other electrooptical functions can be obtained . since the electric field effects , increasing with the applied field strength and the state number ,",
    "compete with the decreasing oscillator strength , we are able , having analytical expressions , to indicate the optimal excitation interval to observe the electrooptical effects",
    ". we also indicate the impact of the finite crystal size on the shape of the spectra , which was overlooked in the previous considerations .",
    "therefore our predictions should be of interest for experimentalists .",
    "the motivation of our considerations is also connected with with potential application of rydberg excitons as solid - state switches . due to their unusual features : long lifetimes , strong dipolar interactions and huge - size",
    ", they are expected to be implemented in quantum information technology .",
    "@xcite observed rydberg blockade rb , which consists in reduction of excitonic absorption accompanied by increasing laser power for lines associated with large n , what means that only limited amount of rydberg excitons is permitted in a well - localized space of the crystal .",
    "the idea of using dipolar rydberg interaction to implement rb bases on the fact that in an ensemble of particles coupled by long - range dipolar interactions , only one particle can be excited at given time .",
    "the blockade originate from dipole - dipole interactions between rydberg excitons unnecessary with the same _",
    "n _ and is strongly influenced by their separation .",
    "this effect offers exciting possibilities for manipulating quantum bits stores in a single collective excitation in mezoscopic ensembles or for realizing scalable quantum logic gates and one implemented in solids would bring a lot of advantages for quantum information , for constructing all - optical switches and single - photon logic devices .",
    "moreover , it is essential to have an additional mechanism for switching the dipole - dipole interaction , which in fact can be tuned on and off by stark effect , therefore it is worth to go into details of the stark effect in rydberg excitons .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ density.matrix ] we present the assumptions of considered model and solve the constitutive equation which give an analytical expression for the electrosusceptibility .",
    "we also use the obtained expression to compute the effective dielectric function , thanks to which the electrooptical functions ( reflectivity , transmissivity , and absorption ) are derived ( section [ eofunctions ] ) . next , in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the electrooptic functions are numerically analyzed for cu@xmath0o crystal for the purpose of realistic implementation of presented method .",
    "we examine in details changes of both real and imaginary part of electrosusceptibility , reflectivity and transmission under the influence of electric field . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw conclusions of the model studied in this paper and we indicate the optimal range of energy for which rydberg excitons could be experimentally observed .",
    "wannier - mott excitons , treated as hydrogen - like particles , due to their small binding energy , are very receptive to the action of external fields ( electric and/or magnetic ) .",
    "the external fields remove the degeneration of the excitonic energy levels and enhance the optical effects .",
    "such effects were observed in the case of rydberg excitons in cu@xmath0o  @xcite,@xcite . in what follows",
    "we describe the electrooptic properties of systems where the rydberg excitons appear . as was recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the so - called real density matrix approach is very effective in describing the optical properties of rydberg excitons .",
    "this approach was used in the past for the description of electrooptical effects ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we show below , that the specific properties of rydberg excitons require a reformulation of the methods used in the past . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not enter into the quantum - mechanical explanation of the valence band structure of the cu@xmath0o .",
    "this explanation is given in details in the recent paper by schweiner _",
    "et al _  @xcite . here",
    "we treat the band structure and the related parameters as known , and use the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite for the situation , when the constant external electric field @xmath4 is applied in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the presented method starts with the constitutive equations , which have the form ( for example , @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bilocal coherent electron - hole amplitude ( pair wave function ) , @xmath8 jest is the excitonic center - of - mass coordinate , @xmath9 the relative coordinate , @xmath10 the smeared - out transition dipole density , @xmath11 is the electric field vector of the wave propagating in the crystal .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 in the constitutive equation represents dissipative processes .",
    "we can expect a significant temperature - dependence of the spectra ; microscopic analysis of damping parameters , which are the main temperature - dependent factors , requires future studies and will not be considered explicitly in this paper .",
    "the interaction with phonons and their role in determining the line shape , discussed recently by schweiner at al ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) who have considered possible causes of line broadening , goes into the field of nonlinear optics and was in the past considered in the framework of the rdma , for example by schlsser ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) or in the case of eit , in ref . @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the interaction with phonons , and take the damping coefficients as phenomenological constants .",
    "the smeared - out transition dipole density @xmath13 is related to the bilocality of the amplitude @xmath7 and describes the quantum coherence between the macroscopic electromagnetic field and the interband transitions .",
    "the two - band hamiltonian @xmath14 includes the electron- and hole kinetic energy terms , the electron - hole interaction potential and the confinement potentials . for details about the hamiltonian",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the coherent amplitude @xmath7 defines the excitonic counterpart of the polarization @xmath15,\\ ] ] which is than used in the maxwell field equation @xmath16 with the use of the bulk dielectric tensor @xmath17 and the vacuum dielectric constant @xmath18 . in the present paper",
    "we solve the equations ( [ constitutiveeqn])-([maxwell ] ) with the aim to compute the electrooptical functions ( reflectivity , transmission , and absorption ) for the case of cu@xmath0o . in the following",
    "we will start with considering the bulk situation , where the center - of - mass motion is decoupled from the relative electron - hole motion and given by the term @xmath19 with the wave vector @xmath20 resulting , in general , from the polariton dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "we also assume the harmonic time dependence @xmath21 .",
    "this assumptions allow to calculate the dielectric susceptibility",
    ". this will be achieved in by expanding the coherent amplitudes @xmath7 in terms of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "let us note that the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath22 can be obtained only in an approximative way ( perturbation calculus , variational method , matrix diagonalization etc . ) .",
    "considering the cases of cu@xmath0o , when the applied field is of the order of 10 v / cm ( @xcite ) , we can compare the magnitude of the electron - hole pair attractive energy ( @xmath23 in the isotropic effective masses approximation ) and the electric field energy @xmath24 . for @xmath25 one",
    "has @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the excitonic character of the spectra prevails and the applied electric field can be considered as perturbation .",
    "it is clear that , when external fields are applied , the full diagonalization of field- and band - mixing effects is more adequate to describe the optical properties , in particular when polarization dependence is considered . however , in the rdma the band parameters , as e.g. the effective masses , are considered as field independent , and the fields are treated as perturbation operators .",
    "such approach was merely applied in the past ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , for various nanostructures and field orientations , and was justified by the agreement with experimental data .",
    "the considered approximation is also justified by the fact , that the applied field strengths are much below the critical values for the fields ( the ionization field for the electric field and the critical magnetic field ) . in the case of cu@xmath00",
    "the ionization field is of the order of 10@xmath28 v / cm , compared to the applied 15 or even 50 v / cm .",
    "we assume the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ schroed ] ) in form of the solutions of an anisotropic schrdinger equation @xmath29 ( see appendix  [ appendix a ] for details ) @xmath30 where@xmath31 with @xmath32 defined by ( [ etaellm ] ) , and the laguerre polynomials @xmath33 ( for example , @xcite ) @xmath34 @xmath35 being the spherical harmonics .",
    "the energy eigenvalues relate to the eigenfunctions ( [ eigenf ] ) have the form ( see eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "we see that the mass anisotropy removes the degeneracy with respect to the quantum number @xmath38 , so that in this approach the higher order excitons @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 etc .",
    "when the electric field is directed along the _",
    "z_-axis , the perturbation operator @xmath42 has the form @xmath43 we look for the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ constitutiveeqn ] ) in the form @xmath44 inserting the above expansion into ( [ constitutiveeqn ] ) we obtain the following system of equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath45 ( for details , see appendix b ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the amplitude of the electric field . in all calculations we will use only the above matrix elements with @xmath49 , denoting them by @xmath50 this is an approximation , which can be justified as follows .",
    "the spacing between the rydberg states , at least for the states @xmath51 considered in this paper , is of the order of a few mev .",
    "taking , for simplicity , rydberg equal to 100 mev , one has the spacings ( taking @xmath52 states ) ( mev ) @xmath53 , etc .",
    "on the other hand , the matrix elements _ v _ , collected in table [ matrix.elements ] and being the measure of the splitting between the stark levels with the same principal number , are of the order between @xmath54 and @xmath55 mev , so that there are much smaller than the distances between the exciton states . obviously , one should notice that the distances between the excitonic states decrease with the increasing number n , whereas the stark splittings increase , and at a certain number the stark splittings are greater than the spacing between the rydberg states .",
    "the indication is that for higher numbers _",
    "one should take into account the interaction ( in other words the matrix elements _ v _ ) between different states , and not only within the same state . besides , the method applied is not exactly the perturbation calculus , rather the matrix diagonalization , so its validity is not restricted by the value of the applied field .",
    "we put the coherent amplitudes ( [ expansion ] ) into the equation ( [ polarization ] ) , from which , when the center - of - mass motion is decoupled , one can obtain the susceptibility from the relation @xmath56 .",
    "the dipole density vectors @xmath57 should be chosen appropriate for _ p_- or _",

    "the explicit form of the oscillator strengths @xmath69 for the isotropic case can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite the oscillator strength @xmath70 associated with p excitons is one order of magnitude greater than @xmath71 .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath75 are calculated in appendix  [ appendix c ] .",
    "in the previous considerations we treated the semiconductor crystal as unbounded . the real situation is different due to crystal finite size in all directions .",
    "practically , the confined size in only one arbitrary chosen direction is considered and usually this direction is the same as electromagnetic wave vector . concerning the experiments with cu@xmath0o one should notice that the dimension of the crystals examined experimentally exceeds the electromagnetic wave length , therefore the use of the long - wave - approximation is not well justified so we will compute the optical functions such as the transmissivity and reflectivity taking into account the finite crystal size and finite wavelength .",
    "we will obtain analytic expressions for the optical functions .",
    "these expressions will also include the impact of the applied constant electric field . in the description of the optical properties of excitons in finite semiconductors the excitonic bohr radius plays an important role .",
    "near the semiconductor surfaces there are layers where the excitons are created ( or destroyed ) , the so - called exciton - free layers ( `` dead layers '' ) .",
    "mostly it is assumed that their thickness amounts to 2 - 3 excitonic bohr radii . in the case of gaas",
    "it gives about 30 nm .",
    "the excitons and related to them polaritons are formed in the remaining volume ( `` bulk '' ) of the crystal , and are responsible for the bulk susceptibility .",
    "the junction of layers with different dielectric properties is a complicated task and many works on this topic , including the so - called abc problem , have been done over the past decades ( for review see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "when we consider a particular case of gaas thin layer of the thickness 150 nm , and the relevant excitonic bohr radius is about 15 nm , then two excitonic bohr radii correspond to 20 % of the crystal size .",
    "when we consider a cu@xmath0o slab , the situation is quite different . for a cu@xmath0o crystal of the size 30 @xmath76 m @xcite , @xcite even the exciton state with _ _",
    "n__=25 has the extension of about 0.6 @xmath76 m , so that the two bohr radii correspond to 4 % of the crystal size .",
    "this means that , in the first approximation , we can neglect the dead layer effects .",
    "it does not mean that the dead layer and polariton effects are not important , as they can shift the resonance positions and affect the oscillator strengths ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "the problem is that , when taking into account 25 excitonic states , we have at least 50 polaritonic waves ( including the in- and outgoing polariton waves ) so that the methods applied for the iii - v and ii - vi compounds ( for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) can not be applied for the case under consideration .",
    "this aspect requires future studies and will not be explicitly considered in this paper .",
    "moreover it should be mentioned that different aspect of semiconductors geometry was considering by schweiner _",
    "et al _ @xcite who have developed the method of investigation excitonic spectra taking into account the discrepancy of valence and conduction bands from parabolic shapes as well as their degeneracy and possible anisotropy .",
    "the formation of excitons can be considered as a fast process leading to an effective dielectric function @xmath77 with the excitonic susceptibility defined in eq .",
    "( [ susceptibility ] ) . thus the electromagnetic wave in the crystal propagates in a medium characterized by the effective dielectric function .",

    "all these interesting features of excitons with high @xmath116 number which are examined and discussed on the basis on our theory might possibly provide deep insight into the nature of rydberg excitons in solids and provoke their application to design all - optical flexible switchers and future implementation in quantum information processing .",
