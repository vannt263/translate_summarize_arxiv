    "viscosity has attracted remarkable attention in the rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) community during the first years of running . in particular , experimental observations of large elliptic flow",

    "2 ) . we focus on bulk viscosity , and show that one can find large , even singular , effects in the neighborhood of @xmath0 ( sec . 3 ) .",
    "although the present study focuses on understanding the behavior and physical explanation of the coefficients , we speculate on the experimental manifestations large viscosities might bring about .    in non - viscous hydrodynamics the elements of the stress - energy tensor",
    "depend only on the energy density @xmath1 and particle - number densities @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are implicitly functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the tilde denotes that @xmath7 is evaluated in a frame where the collective velocity @xmath8 . in navier - stokes hydrodynamics ,",
    "viscosity is incorporated by altering @xmath9 so that it includes terms proportional to the velocity gradients @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the shear and bulk viscosities . in ideal hydrodyanmics",
    "@xmath14 , so the bulk viscosity can be interpreted as describing the correction to the pressure linearly proportional to the rate at which the energy density changes , whereas the shear viscosity describes the asymmetry of @xmath15 due to an anisotropic expansion . in non",
    "- viscous hydrodynamics , accelerations are proportional to the gradient of the pressure , while in general , accelerations arise from derivatives of the stress energy tensor , @xmath16 thus , the components of the stress - energy tensor can be considered as representatives of the pressure in a given direction , and any reduction / rise of @xmath15 from viscous effects will result in a slowing / acceleration of the expansion in that direction .      to derive the kubo relations , one first makes the substitution @xmath20 , where @xmath21 refers to the difference with respect to the time - averaged value of @xmath7 .",
    "after inserting @xmath22 into the integral one can integrate by parts , and because of the substitution with @xmath21 , one can dispose of the contributions at @xmath23 to obtain , @xmath24\\rangle r'_i(\\partial_iu_j),\\\\ \\nonumber & = & ( i/\\hbar)\\int_{r'_0<0 } d^4r ' r'_0",

    "although the kubo relations are difficult to interpret physically , they do make it clear that viscosity is related to the size and to the damping of fluctuations of the elements @xmath7 .",
    "if fluctuations in @xmath7 ( at fixed energy ) are large , or if they are slow to relax , a large viscosity will ensue .",
    "finally , since the kubo relations are based on linear - response theory , i.e. , assuming that the perturbation @xmath40 is small , we emphasize that the corrections to the stress - energy tensor represent an expansion in the velocity gradient .",
    "if the stress - energy tensor is strongly altered , it brings into question the validity of the linear approximation",
    ". this would be especially true if the viscous coefficients diverge as will be the case for the example discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sigmabulk ] .",
    "viscous effects arise whenever the elements of the stress - energy tensor , @xmath7 , have difficulty maintaining the equilibrium values due to a dynamically changing system , i.e. , one with velocity gradients . in this section",
    "we briefly review five physical sources of viscosity , the first three of which have already been explained in the literature .",
    "although viscosity in non - perturbative systems with ambiguous degrees of freedom might defy the simple descriptions of the five effects enumerated below , these examples provide physical insight into the richness of possible root causes for shear and bulk viscosity .    1 .   * viscosity from non - zero mean free paths * : this is the most commonly understood source of viscosity .",
    "it is straight - forward to see how a non - zero collision time leads to an anisotropy for @xmath7 by considering a velocity gradient for a bjorken expansion , @xmath41 , or equivalently , the velocity gradients are @xmath42 .",
    "we consider a particle whose momentum is @xmath43 when measured in the frame moving with the collective velocity corresponding to its position . in the absence of collisions",
    ", @xmath44 will fall with @xmath45 since the particle will asymptotically approach a region where its velocity equals the collective velocity , @xmath46 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are frozen .",
    "the resulting anisotropy in the stress - energy tensor yields the following expression for the shear viscosity @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the collision time .",
    "the anisotropy increases the transverse pressure , giving radial flow an initial boost @xcite , and decreases the longitudinal pressure , thus reducing the longitudinal work which results in a larger transverse energy @xcite .",
    "it is also easy to see how such an expansion does not yield a bulk viscosity for either ultra - relativistic or non - relativistic gases . in those cases",
    "an isotropic expansion scales all three momenta proportional to @xmath51 which maintains thermal equilibrium , and collisions do not play a role .",
    "this is not the case when @xmath52 , or especially if the gas has a mixture of relativistic and non - relativistic particles .",
    "* viscosity from non - zero interaction range * : if the range of interaction between two - particles extends a distance @xmath53 , interactions will share energy between particles from regions with different collective energies . a particle at @xmath54 , where the collective energy is zero , will share energy with particles whose collective energy is @xmath55 . for boltzmann calculations , the viscosity will be proportional to @xmath56 @xcite , with the constant of proportionality depending on the form of scattering kernel .",
    "both bulk and shear terms result from non - zero interaction range . in boltzmann calculations ,",
    "the range of the interaction can approach zero for fixed scattering rates if the over - sampling ratio is allowed to approach infinity .",
    "although this solves causality problems @xcite , it simultaneously eliminates viscous terms arising from finite - range scattering kernels , which might or might not be desirable .",
    "this has profound effects on calculations of elliptic flow , which can vary by a factor of 2 depending on the range of the scattering kernel @xcite .",
    "* classical electric fields * : color flux tubes form after the exchange of soft gluons between nucleons passing at high energy , and might also be formed during rapid hadronization . additionally , longitudinal color electric fields might be created during the pre - thermalized stage of the collision ( color - glass condensate ) . since these fields tend to align with the velocity gradient , they can be a natural source of shear viscosity .",
    "in fact , if the fields are purely longitudinal , the elements of the stress - energy tensor become @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the transverse pressure becomes three times as stiff as a massless gas , @xmath58 , which is usually considered a stiff equation of state .",
    "the negative longitudinal pressure signifies that the energy within a given unit of rapidity is increasing as the work done by the expansion is negative , similar to the stretching of a rubber band .",
    "this _ hyper - shear _ can lead to the development of early collective radial flow . a sophisticated calculation including the effects of interactions amongst the fields @xcite showed a somewhat dampened anisotropy compared to the simple limit discussed here , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "* non - equilibrium chemistry * : chemical equilibirum can not be maintained unless the rate at which equilibrium abundances change is much smaller than the chemical equilibration rate , @xmath61 , @xmath62 if the equilbrium number is slowly changing , abundances will vary from equilbrium by an amount , @xmath63 to associate this departure from equilibrium as a viscosity , one must consider the corresponding change in the pressure , @xmath64 and make a connection between @xmath65 in eq .",

    "if the hydrodynamic equations explicitly treat particle numbers as current obeying chemical evolution rates , chemical non - equilibration would not need to be accounted for through viscous terms .",
    "viscosity from dynamic mean fields * : bosonic mean fields , such as the @xmath70 field , obey the klein - gordon equation . for fluctuations of wave number @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the equilibrium value of the condensate which is non - zero for @xmath74 .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is determined by minimizing the free energy , while the mass is related to the curvature of the free energy near the minimum , @xmath76 one can see the equivalence of eq .",

    "the equivalence with the harmonic oscillator is shown in appendix [ appendix ] along with a derivation of the same result from the perspective of linear response theory assuming a langevin force added to the equations of motion .",
    "+ for the harmonic oscillator , the mean value of the position @xmath81 is altered if the equilibrium position is moving .",
    "the amount of the change was consistent with the drag force @xmath82 being equal and opposite to the restoring force @xmath83 .",
    "the corresponding result can be derived for the damped klein - gordon equation , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mean offset from the equilibrium value .",

    "both of the last two sources of viscosity described in the previous section can be of special importance during the chiral transition .",
    "first , since masses are changing suddenly near @xmath0 , chemical abundances should easily stray from equilibrium .",
    "secondly , the mean field , which is zero above @xmath0 suddenly changes , and given the small masses in this region , large bulk viscosities are expected .    for the linear sigma model , the sigma field and mass are shown as a function of the temperature in the left panels .",
    "near @xmath0 , the masses fall to zero and the mean value of the field changes rapidly , which gives rise to a sharp peak in the bulk viscosity .",

    "we have focused on bulk viscosities associated with the chiral transition . in general",
    ", one would expect such effects whenever a system needs to rapidly rearrange its basic structure . in this sense",
    "these effects have much in common with super - cooling or hysteresis . in the case of a first order transition where super - cooling occurs , the departure from equilibrium is not proportional to the rate at which the system is changing , and the language of navier - stokes hydrodynamics is inappropriate .",
    "the peaking of the bulk viscosity near @xmath0 is in stark contrast to the behavior of the shear viscosity for many fluids which comes to a minimum near @xmath0 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "convincing physical arguments are presented that the shear viscosity for the deconfinement transition also comes to a minimum near @xmath0 . if the source of the viscosity is mainly due to the system s failure to equilibrate a scalar quantity such as the @xmath70 field , one physically expects the singularity to be confined to the bulk viscosity .",
    "however , it is of interest that models of binary fluids also make predictions of a singularity in the shear viscosity near @xmath0 as described in @xcite , where physical arguments are made by thermodynamically linking the diverging correlation length to a divergence in viscous forces .",
    "one lesson from the study of critical phenomena is that critical exponents inferred from mean - field models like those discussed here will likely be incorrect , even though the qualitative behavior might be well reproduced .",
    "the implications for dynamics should be that the matter accelerates more quickly due to the higher gradients in @xmath134 when the interior energy density is above the critical region .",
    "once the matter flows into the viscous region of energy densities , there should be a slowing down and a reduction of surface emission .",
    "this trend would be in the right direction to explain hbt measurements which show a rapid expansion with a sudden disintegration @xcite , but the potential magnitude of the effects are not yet known .",
    "finally , we re - emphasize that if one were to solve for the evolution of the mean fields or chemistry alongside solving the hydrodynamic evolution equations , one could forego incorporating these effects through the viscosity coefficients .",
    "if the stress - energy tensor is strongly affected , the proper conclusion may be that rather than absorbing these effects into viscous hydrodynamics , one should treat non - equilibrated degrees of freedom explicitly .",
    "for instance , the dynamics of the @xmath70 field can be calculated in parallel to the hydrodynamic equations of motion as was done in @xcite , though it would be important to incorporate damping effects which were neglected there .",
