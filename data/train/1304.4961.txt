    "the inner regions of gas - rich protoplanetary disks ( @xmath9au ) are thought to be the birth places of most giant planets @xcite .",
    "the chemical and physical processes sculpting these environments in the first few million years of the life of a star are critical for determining many properties of mature planetary systems .",
    "these include the formation of rocky `` oligarchs ''  the building blocks of terrestrial planets @xcite  and comets and water - rich asteroids important for the delivery of water and organics to planetary surfaces @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the gas - rich inner disk and protoplanets has the power to re - arrange the orbital structure of the entire planetary system @xcite , allowing for significant modification of radial chemical abundance structures ; for instance , the chemical boundary defined by the snow - line may not always be predictive for the compositions of planets in mature systems .",
    "a key diagnostic of the structure of planet - forming regions is the fundamental ( @xmath10 ) rovibrational band of co at 4.7@xmath0 m .",
    "it is particularly sensitive to gas temperatures of 1001000k , corresponding to radii of 0.110au in typical protoplanetary disks around solar - mass pre - main sequence stars .",
    "because of the high opacity of dust at 5@xmath0 m and the low temperatures of disk midplanes beyond @xmath11au , the co fundamental band typically traces the disk at high altitude , specifically the so - called `` warm molecular layer '' @xcite . in comparison with the total disk surface densities in the planet - forming region of @xmath12 ,",
    "the co fundamental band traces roughly @xmath13 , corresponding to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total column of hydrogen nuclei .    while the warm molecular layer represents a small fraction of the total vertical disk column , its structure is intimately linked to key properties of the bulk gas in protoplanetary disks , relevant to their evolution and ability to form planets . through high temperatures and interactions with ionizing stellar radiation ,",
    "the molecular layer acts as a chemical factory , producing water and complex organics @xcite .",
    "it also forms a boundary between the deep , neutral and inactive disk midplane and the uppermost ionized layers . as such",
    ", the physical and kinematical structure of the molecular layer traces thermal and photo - evaporative flows from the disk surface , controlling outward radial mixing and mass loss @xcite .",
    "it is in the molecular layer that the stellar magnetic field can couple to the disk and drive turbulence and accretion flows @xcite .",
    "finally , the molecular layer responds to dynamical perturbations caused by the presence of giant protoplanets , leading to potentially observable effects @xcite .",
    "rovibrational co emission is present throughout a wide range of protoplanetary disks from still embedded protostars @xcite to transitional disks with inner dust holes @xcite , and from low mass t tauri stars @xcite to higher mass herbig stars @xcite .",
    "the co lines are formed by a combination of collisional excitation , infrared ( vibrational ) pumping and uv ( electronic ) fluorescence .",
    "the relative importance of these excitation processes depends on location within the disk and the shape and strength of the radiation field from the central star @xcite .",
    "the advent of the cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ( crires ) instrument on the very large telescope ( vlt ) has opened the possibility to observe the co fundamental bands at higher spectral resolving power ( @xmath1695000 ) and higher spatial resolution than before , thus providing new insight into this critical planet - forming region of the disk .",
    "we present here the results of a large vlt - crires programme of 69 disks around low- and intermediate - mass stars and 22 embedded young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "previous papers have used subsets of our crires database to address a variety of questions .",
    "@xcite investigate the presence and origin of a class of broad single - peaked co rovibrational line profiles indicating non - keplerian gas motions .",
    "using spectro - astrometry , @xcite constrain the structure of the gas emission and velocity fields on milli - arcsecond scales in a smaller sample of disks .",
    "some disks show co emission consistent with simple keplerian models , whereas other disks , especially those in the @xcite sample , show a spectro - astrometry pattern consistent with a slow molecular disk wind . for transitional disks with a large inner dust hole or gap",
    ", @xcite pinpointed the co rovibrational emission to originate from inside the dust gap whereas @xcite resolved the co emission near the outer wall of the hole around the herbig star oph irs 48 .",
    "@xcite characterized the progenitors to protoplanetary disks , when the sources are still embedded in protostellar envelopes .",
    "@xcite found evidence for episodic outflow activity with winds up to 100 km s@xmath5 in broad blue - shifted lines toward one object , whereas @xcite found the same phenomenon for a handful of other embedded sources .",
    "finally , the high spectral resolution of crires also boosts the line to continuum ratio and thus allows the detection of weak lines from minor species .",
    "@xcite accurately measured the isotopologue ratios of the four major co species ",
    "@xmath7co , @xmath6co , c@xmath17o and c@xmath18o  in the circumstellar environment of two young stars .",
    "the aim was to search for mass - independent oxygen isotope fractionation relative to the interstellar medium in order to understand the solar system oxygen anomaly .",
    "@xcite searched for near - infrared lines of small organic molecules ( hcn , c@xmath19h@xmath19 , ch@xmath20 ) in a few sources . while the these studies discuss the detailed properties of specific sub - samples , this paper provides an overview of the basic properties of co rovibrational emission from protoplanetary disks around young solar - type stars at the highest available spectral resolution .",
    "using the entire crires data set , we aim to address the following questions related to the structure and evolution of planet - forming regions of protoplanetary disks : 1 ) where is the co gas located ?",
    "what fraction of sources show emission from a radially flowing surface such as a slow disk wind ?",
    "2 ) what are typical temperatures probed by co and its isotopologues and how do these values compare with current thermo - chemical models of the inner disk ? how are the co fundamental bands excited , and what consequences does the excitation mechanism have for the lines as a tracer of inner disk surfaces ? 3 ) do co line profiles depend on stellar spectral type , and is this a tracer of the prevalence of uv fluorescent excitation over thermal excitation ?",
    "4 ) what evolutionary changes occur in the gas ?",
    "in this paper , we analyze high resolution spectra of the 4.7 micron co v=10 fundamental emission band using the crires on the vlt of the european southern observatory ( eso ) @xcite .",
    "crires operates at high resolution ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) using a @xmath23 slit .",
    "it is fed by a multi - application curvature adaptive optics ( macao ) system , which allows correction of atmospheric turbulence and can provide diffraction limited images at the focal plane , therefore improving the overall instrument sensitivity .",
    "the sample consists of 91 young stars  69 protoplanetary disks around young stars and 22 embedded protostars that are still surrounded by massive remnant envelopes .",
    "the data were obtained as part of an _ eso large programme _ to study infrared molecular emission from solar - type protostars and protoplanetary disks @xcitepontoppi ] .",
    "we discuss here primarily the disk sample , but compare our results with those of the embedded protostars presented in @xcite to search for evolutionary trends between embedded and classical protoplanetary disks .",
    "the disk sample spans a range of physical properties including spectral type , stellar mass and luminosity , and inclination .",
    "such a large sample of co emission profiles provides an opportunity for a broad examination of the gas distribution in a wide variety of circumstellar environments .",
    "the sample was chosen to include protoplanetary disks around solar - mass ( @xmath24 ) young stars ( see figure [ fig : spt ] ) .",
    "a range of evolutionary states were sampled from massive gas - rich disks that are optically thick to visible and uv radiation to transition disks with inner dust holes or gaps .",
    "the sources are located in the nearby star forming regions visible from paranal observatory , including taurus , ophiuchus , serpens , corona australis and chamaeleon .",
    "all these regions have undergone recent active star formation and have ages of approximately 15 myr @xcite .",
    "protoplanetary disks were selected based on brightness ( @xmath25mjy at @xmath26 m ) , as well as the existence of prior datasets characterizing the structure of the disks and supporting the presence of significant gas reservoirs .",
    "the prior datasets defining the sample include spitzer spectroscopy from the cores to disks ( c2d ) spitzer legacy survey @xcite , the keck - nirspec 35@xmath0 m protoplanetary disk survey ( e.g. @xcite ) and the vlt - isaac protostellar survey @xcite .",
    "we limited the survey to disks around solar - type stars ( @xmath27 ) , excluding most herbig aebe stars ",
    "the focus of complementary crires surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the high spectral resolution and high dynamic range of crires spectra , a factor of four improvement in spectral resolution over most previous co surveys , fully resolves the individual line profiles so that velocity information can be used to locate the gas within the disk .",
    "the resolution is particularly needed in the cases of disks with low inclinations where the lines are intrinsically narrow and in the cases where multiple components , particularly absorption features , contribute to the line profile .",
    "because of the adaptive optics system , line emission can be spatially resolved down to angular scales of @xmath28 .",

    "gas phase lines from higher vibrational states and rarer co isotopologues such as @xmath6co , c@xmath17o and c@xmath18o are also included in the wavelength settings .",
    "the spectra were obtained using an abba 10 \" nodding pattern permitting a first order correction of the infrared background by pair subtraction .",
    "integration times were generally 816 minutes per spectral setting .",
    "the reduction of the spectra is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration used the prevalent telluric features in the standard star spectra .",
    "atmospheric features were removed by dividing the source spectrum by the standard star spectrum .",
    "standard stars were observed close in time and elevation to minimize atmospheric differences . remaining small discrepancies from airmass differences and subpixel variations in wavelength solution",
    "were corrected by scaling or shifting the standard spectrum to minimize telluric residuals .",
    "remaining strong telluric features were blanked from the analyzed spectra .",
    "the observations were preferentially scheduled for periods when the earth s velocity around the sun created large shifts of the source lines relative to the telluric features .",
    "when possible , complete wavelength coverage was obtained using the earth s orbital motion between separated observation dates to doppler shift the telluric features relative to the source lines .",
    "the spectra from two or more dates were then combined , barring large differences in line profiles .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute flux calibration is @xmath34 , estimated by comparing raw counts of consecutive nod pairs .",
    "this flux calibration is limited by differences in strehl ratio between the target disk and the standard star , as well as by pointing jitter .",
    "we therefore scaled the spectra to known m band fluxes ( see table c1 ) , with many from the spitzer irac 2 band .",
    "note , however , that some protoplanetary disks are known to be variable on short time scales at the 1060% level @xcite and discrepancies could exist based on the different aperture sizes . in cases where no spitzer photometry was available a linear relationship between the maximum counts received and the flux was determined based on the sources with known fluxes . determining the flux using this method led to a median error in derived fluxes of @xmath820% for sources with previously known fluxes .",

    "we approach the search for variability in two ways : firstly , by simply comparing the line fluxes from the two observations and searching for significant systematic differences ( taking into account our large error bars ) , and secondly , by closely examining the line profiles for differences in shape .",
    "overall , we find on timescales of up to two years a perhaps surprising lack of variability in most of the line profiles .",
    "a clear exception is ex lup , which was undergoing a large outburst during the period of our programme ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "ru lup shows a systematic decrease in line flux by 60% between april 2007 and april 2008",
    ". the decrease could be due to either an increase in the continuum level or a decrease in the co flux .",

    "figure [ fig : gallery ] shows a close up of the p(8 ) line at 4.7359 @xmath0 m for all sources . in most cases we do not find any significant dependence of the emission line shape with rotational quantum number within the observed range ( typically r(1)p(32 ) ) . s cra b and dg cra are exceptions with a colder narrow component and a broader warm component in the @xmath7co profile ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "sources with clean emission lines can be classified based on line width ( fig .",
    "[ fig : miniprofiles ] ) , with four distinct categories : ( 1 ) narrow , ( 2 ) broad single peaked , ( 3 ) broad , and ( 4 ) double peaked .",
    "the narrow category sources have line widths at base of less that 35 km s@xmath5 .",
    "disks in this category are known to be face - on and/or transitional in nature ( tw hya , lkh@xmath36 330 , hd 135344 b , irs 48 ) , with co likely arising from further out in the disk @xcite . lines which are slightly broader ( fwhm @xmath8 1340 km s@xmath5 ) are generally part of the single - peaked line profile sample of @xcite .",
    "these lines are characterized by a single central peak with broad wings and have large line - to - continuum values .",
    "the broad category objects retain a single peak but the contrast between the line width at the top and bottom ( the @xmath37 value of @xcite ) decreases .",
    "the last group shows a double peaked structure .",
    "many of the co emission lines in our sample are slightly asymmetric .",
    "to evaluate the magnitude of any asymmetries , the difference between the integrated flux in the blue and red sides of the lines was calculated for the stacked line profiles ( see figure [ fig : asym ] ) . where possible , the line center was determined from stellar radial velocity measurements . however , such measurements do not exist for many of the stars in the sample . in these cases ,",
    "the line center was estimated from fitting and checked for large deviations from the known molecular cloud velocities .",
    "the lines show an overall tendency for excess emission on the blue side , regardless of line profile category .",
    "this trend affects lines of all widths indicating that it is unlikely to be a geometric effect .",
    "telluric features introduce some uncertainty into the integrated fluxes but no systematic correlation with the telluric feature placement is seen .",
    "the most dramatic cases of this shift are those in the category which show strong emission only on the blue side of the line while absorption dominates the red side of the line .",
    "however , for the majority of the sample , the magnitude of the effect is generally small , @xmath810% compared to the total flux .",
    "absorption lines are common throughout the sample , with a detection rate of 67% ( 46 sources ) .",
    "line widths range from the resolution limit of @xmath83 km",
    "s@xmath5 to tens of km s@xmath5 . the energy levels with detectable absorption also vary from only the lowest @xmath29 levels to throughout the observed range , reflecting underlying temperature differences .",
    "in general , hotter gas produces broader lines , at a level much stronger than expected from thermal broadening ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhmt ] ) .",
    "the lines occur both with and without emission .",
    "we divide the lines based on profile shape and temperature into four categories : ( 5 ) unresolved absorption , ( 6 ) broad central absorption , ( 7 ) blue absorption , and ( 8) absorption with blue emission .",
    "the narrow absorption lines in category 5 are the most commonly seen absorption lines in our disk sample at 59% of all sources that show absorption ( 27/46 ) . for 21 of these sources , listed as fa ( for foreground absorption ) in table [ table : feat ] , the lines are strongest in the lowest @xmath29 levels and disappear for higher energy transitions ( @xmath388 ) .",
    "the remaining 6 sources in this category have hotter co absorption and are listed in table [ table : cat ] .",
    "warm central absorption ( category 6 ) is less common and almost always occurs with resolved line profiles .",

    "these warm absorption lines usually have fwhm of @xmath8 10 km s@xmath5 and occur together with broader emission lines .",
    "absorption feature velocities generally agree well with stellar radial velocities ( see table [ table : radvel ] ) .",

    "the maximum velocities are less than 50 km s@xmath5 , except for irs 46 where the gas reaches @xmath860 km s@xmath5 . the final category ( category 8) have lines that are characterized by emission on the blue side and absorption on the red ( figure  [ fig : windj2 ] ) .     for cw tau , sr 24 a , and sr 24 b / c . [ fig : windj2],width=340 ]    , attributed to outflows .",

    "[ fig : windj],width=377 ]      only six of our sources show no indication of co lines in either emission or absorption . if co is present , the lines are either weak or narrow enough to be lost in the telluric features ( @xmath3920 km / s ) . in all cases ,",
    "the continuum is detected ( generally s / n of @xmath850 ) , indicating the presence of circumstellar dust in late - type stars .",
    "the co non - detection from ux tau a is particularly surprising as @xcite show a clear detection within this band with nirspec data .",

    "hd 176386 is a b9 star @xcite while hd 144965 a has a spectral type of b3 so both disks may simply have no co close to the star due to high photodissociation rates . in general , very few sources have no co visible in the spectrum .",
    "the high resolving power of crires allows for the detection of low - contrast emission lines , leading to an enhanced potential for measuring the rotational temperatures and accurate column densities of the weak optically thin isotopologues . in this section , we take advantage of this to compare the rotational temperatures of @xmath7co , @xmath6co @xmath35 and @xmath7co @xmath40 transitions .",
    "a linear fit to the continuum was determined for each line , using uncontaminated continuum within 300 km s@xmath5 of the line center and 50 km s@xmath5 greater than the line width . for accurate measurements of integrated line fluxes , we constructed template line profiles by stacking isolated lines free of strong telluric absorption .",
    "absorption components were removed using a gaussian profile .",
    "the integrated line fluxes were determined by scaling the template to each line ( or a superposition of templates in case of line blends ) using levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization .",
    "this method proved advantageous to direct integration of the line flux : while direct integration works well for strong lines , it is problematic for multi - component line shapes , weak lines and lines affected by telluric absorption .",
    "each line fit was examined by eye and those that clearly did not recover a meaningful line flux due to strong telluric residuals or line blending were removed from further analysis .",
    "the fluxes are put into rotational diagrams to determine rotational temperatures and column densities .",
    "based on an assumed boltzmann distribution , the observed flux @xmath41 is such that : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the emitting area , @xmath44 is the einstein a coefficient of each level @xmath45 to which the @xmath29 level can decay , @xmath46 is the statistical weight of each level ( i.e. , 2@xmath29 + 1 ) , @xmath47 is the column density , @xmath48 is the partition function , @xmath49 is the energy of the transition , and @xmath50 is the rotation temperature . for optically thin , isothermal gas in thermodynamic equilibrium ( te ) ,",
    "rotation diagrams produce a straight line with a slope of inverse temperature and an intercept proportional to the total mass of gas , but are insensitive to emitting area . in the optically thick limit , temperature and emitting area are degenerate , while the rotation diagrams are insensitive to the total column density .",
    "thus , curved rotation diagrams can be a sign of high line optical depths varying with @xmath29 , although multiple temperature components can also cause curvature .",
    "when both optically thick and thin tracers are used , it may be possible to constrain all three parameters , @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath43 , if both isotopologues arise from the same region , but , as shown below , this is not the case .",
    "@xmath6co is detected in emission from 27 sources and suitable line fits ( minumum of good fits to five clean lines ) could be determined for 12 sources ( see table [ table : rotpar ] ) .",

    "co fundamental lines are commonly seen from the circumstellar environments of young stars and provide information on molecular gas in the planet - forming region in disks that alma will not be able to probe .",
    "our extensive collection of high spectral resolution crires observations reveal complex environments with signatures of disks , envelopes , foreground molecular clouds , winds and outflows in diverse combinations .",
    "young disks display a variety of complex line profiles with simple double - peaked keplerian disk profiles being surprisingly rare .",
    "most line profiles have wings consistent with keplerian rotation in the inner disk close to the dust sublimation radius",
    ". however , the majority of the emission lines have excess flux at the line center , which in a disk model requires emission from large radii . in most cases ,",
    "there is no evidence of spatial extent in the co lines , ruling out standard keplerian disk models .",
    "this trend , plus a tendency for slight excess emission on the blue side of the lines , leads us to conclude that slow disks winds may be common from young stars and traceable through co lines .",
    "the high spectral resolution and sensitivity of crires allow a more comprehensive overview of emission lines from weaker isotopologues .",
    "@xmath6co lines suffer less confusion from optical depth effects than @xmath7co lines and thus provide better constraints on the gas properties .",
    "the @xmath6co lines are detected with much greater frequency than in previous studies and have lower excitation temperatures , indicating an origin further out radially or deeper within the vertical structure .",
    "the @xmath6co line widths are generally narrower than those of @xmath7co , indicating dominance by slower velocity gas arising from larger radii . the @xmath6co line strengths for the objects with the coldest gas imply large column densities / emitting areas if only collisional excitation is assumed .",
    "ir resonant scattering may contribute to the line fluxes , as has been proposed for herbig ae / be stars , so that the inferred column densities are upper limits .",
    "the derived temperatures are roughly consistent with current thermo / chemical models of the inner disk .",
    "non - thermal excitation is clearly reflected in the co lines , hinting at the complex photoprocesses at work in the molecular layer .",
    "vibrational emission from thermally inaccessible energy levels is detected in about 50% of the sources .",
    "this emission is correlated with accretion luminosity indicating that the uv radiation arising from accretion drives the fluorescent pumping , particularly in late - type stars where the stellar uv continuum is weak .",
    "finally , we examine the large sample for trends between different types of sources .",
    "the change from class i embedded protostar to class ii disk produces dramatic changes in the co spectra , as the removal of the protostellar envelope results in the disappearance of the strong absorption lines and ice feature characteristic of class i spectra .",
    "however , the emission lines from class i and ii sources , both arising from close to the star , are similar in detection frequency , excitation and line shape , indicating that disk characteristics are established early .",
    "the beginning of disk dispersal seen in transition disks also brings changes to the co spectra .",
    "transition disk co lines are generally keplerian with a tendency for narrow line widths indicating gas at larger radii .",
    "herbig ae / be stars also typically have narrower lines , but in this case , it is likely due to an increase in the dust sublimation radius and the disk region with temperatures suitable for detecting rovibrational co.    we have highlighted general trends from the large sample to provide an overview of co gas within young systems .",
    "however , the individual spectra are all unique , reflecting physical differences among the stars , disks and surrounding environments .",
    "we hope that future detailed modeling will be able to exploit fully all the information contained in these rich co spectra .",
    "[ fig : extent ] presents the emission of the three additional sources in our disk sample for the lines can be directly imaged : ec 82 , r cra and t cra . lln 19 ,",
    "a massive embedded object , also shows extended emission .",
    "as found previously for the embedded sources gss 30 and irs 43 by @xcite , most of the visually extended sources appear to be outflows with the spatially extended emission occurring on only one side of the spectral trace , probably in the outflow cavity wall ( see figure [ fig : extent ] ) .",
    "evidence for outflows is also seen in broad absorption lines for these and other sources ( figures [ fig : profiles ] and [ fig : gallery ] ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast with the slow molecular winds analyzed through spectro - astrometry @xcite , the outflows show large blue - shifts up to a few 100 km s@xmath5 from source velocity .",
    "the gas closest to the star rotates most rapidly producing the wings of the line profile . assuming that the co lines arise from such a disk , the innermost extent of the co can be measured based on the width of the line base .",
    "two different methods of measuring the width of the stacked line profiles were used to overcome this problem ( table [ table : innervel ] ) . in the first , the width was measured between the points where the line rose above 3 times the continuum noise . in the second ,",
    "the width was measured at 5% of the peak flux values .",
    "these two measurements are often similar for our typical noise levels .",
    "when the continuum noise is low the first method provides a better grasp of the actual extent of the gas .",
    "inner radii were determined by stacking clean lines to decrease continuum noise .",
    "the derived number is actually in terms of @xmath86 and thus the resulting radius is dependent on the inclination and stellar mass .",
    "the corresponding @xmath87 was calculated assuming keplerian rotation and a typical stellar mass for the spectral type ( o , b - 5 m@xmath63 , a - 3 m@xmath63 , f , g - 1 m@xmath63 , and k , m - 0.5 m@xmath63 ) .",
    "the resulting numbers are highly dependent on inclination particularly for low inclination sources . for example , tw hya , which has a known inclination of 4 - 7@xmath88 @xcite , has an @xmath87 of 9.9 au but an actual inner radius of less than 0.048 - 0.15 au .",
    "also , any disk turbulence will broaden the line resulting in a smaller estimated inner radius than is actually the case .",
    "the disk turbulence is likely to be small compared to the line widths of @xmath6250 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath86 for the t tauri stars is flat within the errors as expected if inclination is the dominant effect .",
    "the range of values is consistent with keplerian emission from the inner disk close to the dust sublimation radii as measured by infrared interferometry ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the smallest @xmath86 values belong to the single peaked keplerian sources , which in our sample are mainly transition disks with known low inclinations .",
