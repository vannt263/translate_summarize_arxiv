    "in reactions leading to hadronic final states  ( ) between identical bosons are well known .",
    "these correlations lead to an enhancement of the number of identical bosons over that of non - identical bosons when the two particles are close to each other in phase space .",
    "experimentally this effect was first observed for pions by goldhaber et al .",
    "@xcite . for recent reviews",
    "see , for example , reference  @xcite . in  annihilations at center - of - mass energies of 91 gev ,",
    "have been observed for charged pion pairs  @xcite , for @xmath51 pairs  @xcite and also for @xmath52  @xcite .    in the present paper we report on an investigation of for charged pions between reactions at center - of - mass energies of 172 and 183 gev , above the threshold for w - pair production .",
    "the analysis is motivated by the question of whether for pions from different w bosons exist or not .",
    "theoretically this question is still not settled  @xcite . however ,",
    "if such correlations do exist , this could bias significantly the measurement of the w boson mass in fully hadronic w - pair events  @xcite .",
    "the delphi collaboration has published a measurement , at @xmath53 gev , of  between pions originating from two different w bosons  @xcite , in which basically  in @xmath1  events were subtracted from those of @xmath2  events .",
    "the aim of the present analysis is to analyse  for fully hadronic w - pair events ( @xmath2 ) , semileptonic w - pair events ( @xmath1 ) , as well as non - radiative @xmath3  events . after having established  in hadronic w decays ,",
    "are investigated separately for three classes of pions : those originating from the same w boson , those from different w bosons and those from non - radiative @xmath3  events .",
    "note that in this analysis , tracks are not assigned to jets or w - bosons and no kinematic fits are needed .    between identical bosons can be formally expressed in terms of the normalised function @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total boson production cross section , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the single - boson density in momentum space and the inclusive cross section , respectively . similarly @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the density of the two - boson system and its inclusive cross section .",
    "the product of the independent one - particle densities @xmath60 is referred to as the reference density distribution , to which the measured two - particle distribution is compared .",
    "the inclusive two - boson density @xmath58 can be written as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the two - body correlations .",
    "in the simple case of two identical bosons the normalised density function @xmath63 , defined in eq .",
    "[ eq_1 ] , describes the two - body correlations .",
    "thus one has @xmath64 where @xmath65 $ ] is the normalised two - body correlation term . since  are present when the bosons are close to one another in phase space , a natural choice is to study them as a function of the lorentz invariant variable @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 which approaches zero as the identical bosons move closer in phase space . here",
    "@xmath68 is the four - momentum vector of the @xmath69th particle , @xmath70 is the boson mass ( here @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 is the invariant mass squared of the two - boson system .",
    "ideally the reference sample should contain all correlations present in the sample used to measure @xmath73 , other than the  , such as those due to energy , momentum and charge conservation , resonance decays and global event properties . in this analysis ,",
    "the reference is chosen to be a sample of unlike - charge pairs of pions from the same event . since the presence of the resonances @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the unlike - charge reference sample leads to kinematic correlations which are not present in the like - charge sample , the unlike - charge sample has to be corrected for this effect using simulated events .    assuming a spherically symmetric pion source with a gaussian radial distribution , the correlation function @xmath63 can be parametrised  @xcite by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the radius of the source and @xmath4 represents the strength of the correlation , with @xmath83 .",
    "a value of @xmath84 corresponds to a fully chaotic source , while @xmath85 corresponds to a completely coherent source without any .",
    "the function @xmath86 is the probability that a selected track pair is really a pair of pions , as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "the additional empirical term takes into account the behaviour of the correlation function at high @xmath66 values due to long - range particle correlations ( e.g. charge and energy conservation , phase - space constraints ) , and @xmath87 is a normalisation factor .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a brief overview of the opal detector , the event and track selections as well as monte carlo models . in section 3",
    "the analysis of the data is described .",
    "are investigated for @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 events . after establishing  in hadronic w - events the chaoticity parameter for  between the decay products from the same w , @xmath88 , and from different w bosons , @xmath89 ,",
    "are determined .",
    "finally , section 4 summarises the results obtained .",
    "a detailed description of the opal detector has been presented elsewhere  @xcite and therefore only the features relevant to this analysis are summarised here .",
    "charged particle trajectories are reconstructed using the cylindrical central tracking detectors which consist of a silicon microvertex detector , a high - precision gas vertex detector , a large - volume gas jet chamber and thin @xmath90-chambers .",

    "the entire central detector is contained within a solenoid that provides an axial magnetic field of 0.435  t. the silicon microvertex detector consists of two layers of silicon strip detectors , allowing to measure at least one hit per charged track in the angular region @xmath95 .",
    "it is surrounded by the vertex drift chamber , followed by the jet chamber , about 400  cm in length and 185  cm in radius , that provides up to 159 space points per track and also measures the ionisation energy loss of charged particles , @xmath96 . with at least 130 charge samples along a track",
    ", a resolution of @xmath97 is achieved for the @xmath96  for minimum ionising pions in jets  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath90-chambers , which considerably improve the measurement of charged tracks in @xmath93 , follow the jet chamber at large radius .",
    "the combination of these chambers leads to a momentum resolution of @xmath98 ( gev/@xmath99)@xmath100 .",
    "track finding is nearly 100% efficient within the angular region @xmath101 .",
    "the mass resolution for @xmath102 , related to the resolution in the correlation variable @xmath66 , is found to be @xmath103 mev/@xmath104  @xcite .",
    "this study is carried out using data at  center - of - mass energies of 172 gev and 183 gev with integrated luminosities of approximately 10  pb@xmath100 and 57  pb@xmath100 , respectively .",
    "three mutually exclusive event samples are selected : a ) _ the fully hadronic event sample _ , @xmath2 , where both w bosons decay hadronically ; b)_the semileptonic event sample _ , @xmath1 , where one w decays hadronically and the other decays semileptonically ; and c ) hadronic non - w events @xmath3 , referred to here as the _ the non - radiative @xmath105event sample _ in this analysis . throughout this paper , a reference to w@xmath106 or its decay products implicitly includes the charge conjugate states .",
    "the selection of fully hadronic @xmath2  events is performed in two stages using a preselection based on cuts followed by a likelihood  based selection procedure .",
    "fully hadronic decays , @xmath2  are characterised by four or more energetic hadronic jets and little missing energy .",
    "a preselection using kinematic variables removes background predominantly from radiative @xmath3  events .",
    "events satisfying the preselection criteria are subjected to a likelihood selection , which discriminates between signal and the remaining four - jet - like qcd background .    at 172 gev ,",
    "several variables based on the characteristic four - jet - like nature , momentum balance and jet angular structure , are used to distinguish @xmath2   events from the remaining background and to construct the likelihood .",
    "the details of the selection at 172 gev are described in appendix b of  @xcite .",
    "the signal and background situation at 183 gev is similar to the one at 172 gev .",
    "for this reason , no new selection strategy was developed and the event selection at 183 gev is just a reoptimised version of the selection at 172 gev .",
    "the details of the selection at 183 gev are described in  @xcite . at 183 gev",
    ", no cut was applied against @xmath107@xmath107events .",
    "overall , there is a background of @xmath108 from @xmath3  events and a contribution of @xmath109 from @xmath110 events .",
    "no selection for @xmath2  events is applied to events selected as @xmath1  events .",
    "@xmath111  and @xmath112  events are characterised by two well - separated hadronic jets , a high - momentum lepton and missing momentum due to the unobserved neutrino . in @xmath113",
    "the @xmath114 lepton gives rise to a low - multiplicity jet consisting of one or three tracks .",
    "the tracks from @xmath114 decay are not used in in the  studies .",
    "cuts are applied to reduce the background from radiative @xmath3  events .",
    "a likelihood is formed using kinematic variables and characteristics of the lepton candidate to further suppress the background from @xmath3  events .",
    "the details of the selection at 172 gev are given in appendix a of  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1  event selection for the 183  gev data is a modified version of the 172  gev selection . at 183  gev ,",
    "a looser set of preselection cuts is used since the lepton energy spectrum is broader due to the increased boost and the set of variables used in the likelihood selections is modified . in the @xmath113  sample there is a significant background from hadronic decays of single w events ( @xmath115 ) and an additional likelihood selection is used to reduce this background .",
    "this is only applied to @xmath113  events where the tau is identified as decaying in the single prong hadronic channel .",
    "finally , in order to reduce @xmath107@xmath107  contribution , events passing the @xmath111  likelihood selection are rejected if there is evidence of a second energetic electron .",
    "a similar procedure is applied to the @xmath112  selection .",

    "there is a background of @xmath116 from @xmath3  events , @xmath117 from @xmath2  events , @xmath118 from single w events and @xmath119 from @xmath120  events .      here",
    ", an extension of the selection criteria defined in  @xcite is used , which starts by selecting hadronic events defined as in  @xcite . to reject background from @xmath121 and @xmath122 and to ensure that the events are well contained in the opal detector one requires that the event has at least seven charged tracks with transverse momentum @xmath123",
    "mev/@xmath99 and that the polar angle of the thrust axis lies within the range @xmath124 . to reject events with large initial - state radiation ,",
    "one requires @xmath125  gev , where @xmath126  is the effective invariant mass of the hadronic system  @xcite . for the suppression of the @xmath127",
    "background one requires that the events are selected neither for the semileptonic nor for the fully hadronic @xmath127  samples described above .",
    "the cut in the relative likelihood for vetoing @xmath2  events is looser than in the @xmath2  event selection .",
    "after selection , there is a residual background of @xmath128 from w - pair events and a contribution of @xmath129 from @xmath107@xmath107  events .",
    "note that the three event selections result in completely independent event samples without any overlap .",
    "after the event selection the following cuts are applied to all tracks , for all three event samples . a track is required to have a transverse momentum @xmath130",
    "gev/@xmath99 , momentum @xmath131  gev/@xmath99 and a corresponding error of @xmath132  gev/@xmath99 . only tracks with polar angles @xmath93 satisfying @xmath133 are considered .",
    "the probability for a track to be a pion is enhanced by requiring that the pion probability p@xmath134 from the d@xmath135/d@xmath136 measurement is p@xmath137 .",
