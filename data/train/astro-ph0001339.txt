    "early observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with afterglows led us to hypothesize that grbs with afterglows are spectrally harder than those without . however , the heterogeneous nature of grb observations , coupled with the multi - wavelength nature of afterglow observations , has led us to a number of _ concerns _ :",
    "1 .   afterglow observations are heterogeneous : observational biases for detecting radio afterglows are different than those for detecting optical and/or x - ray afterglows .",
    "2 .   a grb might have no intrinsic afterglow , or inadequate search conditions might result in no afterglow being detected .",
    "spectral hardness measures are biased by instrument performance : one instrumental dataset should be used .    our _ solutions _ to these concerns are as follows :    1 .",
    "we require grbs to either have detected radio afterglows or moderately - complete radio afterglow searches .",
    "this condition satisfies the first and second concerns .",
    "we require that grbs be observed by batse .",
    "this satisfies the third concern .",
    "our resulting database is shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".grbs with and without radio afterglows . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to determine why this difference in hardness might exist , we checked other hardness ratios in the four - channel data .",
    "hardness ratios involving channels 3 and 4 indicate similar results as obtained in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , any spectral differences dependent on radio afterglow type appear to result from the distribution of high energy photons .",
    "this is supported by figure [ fig2 ] , which indicates no correlation of radio afterglow type with hardness ratio hr21 .",
    "this is also supported by figure [ fig3 ] , which compares the grb function spectral parameters e@xmath0 and @xmath1 for the bursts in question ( grbs 980425 and 980519 are not plotted due to large @xmath1 errors ) .",
    "large values of e@xmath0 , large values of @xmath1 , or both produce conditions indicating many high - energy photons .",
    "grbs with radio afterglows tend to occupy a different diagram region than grbs without radio afterglows .",
    "since e@xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained from time - averaged spectra , we suspect that the diagram regions might be even more distinct if signal - to - noise were better for faint batse grbs .",
    "the possible correlation between grb spectral hardness and afterglow type can be clarified with additional observations in the future .",
    "resolution of the status of grb 980425 would also help clarify this issue .",
    "if grb spectral hardness is an indicator of radio afterglow type , then a direct link between the central engine and the delayed emission is established .",
    "such a link could be very important to the understanding of grb physics .",
    "the lorentz factor of the expanding external shock could be constrained by this correlation .",
    "for this reason , it is as important to determine upper flux limits on afterglow non - detections as it is to provide information on detections .",
    "there is evidence that grbs with radio afterglows have harder gamma - ray burst emission than those without . due to",
    "small number statistics , the significance of this correlation depends at present time on whether or not grb 980425 is associated with supernova sn 1998bw . there is evidence of a similar correlation between bursts with optical afterglows , but this is more difficult to document because the literature is less clear on conditions under which an optical search failed to yield an afterglow .",
    "if we assume that a relationship exists between spectral hardness and radio afterglow type , then grbs with radio afterglows appear to have more high - energy photons ( e @xmath2 100 kev ) than those without radio afterglows , as determined from the spectral parameters e@xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "also , roughly @xmath3 of batse - detected grbs should produce radio afterglows based on the overall distributions of e@xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that all grbs producing afterglows of any type belong to the long , bright , soft grb class .",
    "we thank dale frail , chip meegan , geoff pendleton , ralph wijers , david haglin , and chryssa kouveliotou for valuable discussions .",
