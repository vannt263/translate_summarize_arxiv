    "during past decade the progress in creation of bose - einstein condensates of atoms with large magnetic moments @xcite opened up a new area in the physics of ultracold gases .",
    "the interplay of the anisotropic long - range dipole - dipole interaction and a short - range repulsion leads to the exciting properties of dipolar condensates @xcite .",
    "interesting , but less studied is the behavior of dipolar bose mixtures . depending on the system s parameters the phase diagram of binary dipolar bose condensates is characterized by the alternation of stable - unstable regions @xcite and complicated structures formation @xcite .",
    "the ground - state properties of low - dimensional systems were also extensively studied @xcite . in the quasi - two - dimensional case , where the presence of dipole - dipole interaction leads to the maxon - roton spectrum @xcite of elementary excitations , the two - component dipolar bose system exhibits phase separation caused by the softening of the roton mode @xcite .",
    "the long - range character of dipolar two - body interaction is responsible for the creation of solitons with a large number of atoms @xcite . even for the binary bose condensate that contains only one dipolar component a variety of non - trivial phases emerges , including a novel quantized vortices phase @xcite in the rotating system and robust supersolid phases @xcite in the system on the square lattice .",
    "recent observation @xcite of the droplets formation in dysprosium ( @xmath0dy ) condensate will surely stimulate further studies of dipolar bose systems .",
    "these experiments discovered an intriguing phase of the system where the superfluidity is accompanied by the broken translational invariance .",
    "actually , they revealed the role of quantum fluctuations @xcite in the formation of new states of matter .    in the present article by means of hydrodynamic",
    "approach we study the properties of two - component dipolar bose mixtures which , we hope , will soon be implemented . in particular , it is indicated the impact of the beyond mean - field effects on the stability and superfluid properties of two - component dipolar bosonic gases .",
    "the considered model is characterized by the following action @xmath1 and the summation over repeated indices @xmath2 is assumed .",
    "the first term describes two non - interacting sorts of bose particles with chemical potentials @xmath3 and the second one takes into account both dipole - dipole interaction as well as short - range repulsion between particles @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 , i.e. all dipole moments @xmath7 are assumed to be oriented along @xmath8 axis .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions with large volume @xmath9 on the spatial dependence of complex fields @xmath10 and with period @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the temperature ) on the imaginary time variable @xmath13 .    in order to study the properties of low - energy collective modes we pass to the phase - density representation of @xmath14-fields @xcite @xmath15 for the spatially uniform system we can use the following decomposition of density and phase fields @xmath16 treating @xmath17 as equilibrium densities of each component @xcite .",
    "we also define four - momentum @xmath18 with condition @xmath19 imposed on the wave vector , and introduce bosonic matsubara frequency @xmath20 .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach allows us to proceed further consideration in the canonical ensemble . the corresponding action after substitution of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",

    "we see that the mean - field thermodynamics of the uniform dipolar bose system is unaffected by dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "it is easy to show by means of simple diagonalization procedure that @xmath31 is the action of non - interacting bogoliubov quasiparticles with two branches of excitation spectrum and the last term in eq .",
    "( [ s_hydro ] ) takes into account interaction between them @xmath32 these collisional terms are responsible for the simplest quasiparticle decay processes providing the finiteness of the elementary excitation lifetime .",
    "previously @xcite it was shown how to relate parameters of low - lying excitations with measurable quantities of the one - component dipolar superfluid .",
    "this analysis can be naturally extended on the two - component bose mixtures with the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in particular , for all diagrams with two external @xmath33-lines one obtains @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] mentioning that differentiation of every exact vertex function with respect to @xmath17 adds one more zero - momentum @xmath35 line to this vertex we conclude @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the free energy density of a two - component dipolar bose system .",
    "note that only second - order vertices exhibit anisotropic behavior in the long - wavelength limit , i.e. , depending on the angle between momentum and the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "similarly to the one - component case we can derive the second class of identities supposing that each constituent of our system moves with velocity @xmath38 , which is equivalent to the following gauge transformation @xmath39 of the initial action ( [ s_hydro ] ) .",
    "rotational invariance in the transverse to the external field plane ensures that thermodynamic quantities of the moving bose system depend only on @xmath40 and @xmath41 , therefore for the free energy density we have @xmath42 where introduced here symmetric matrices @xmath43 , @xmath44 have the meaning of superfluid mass densities along and in the transverse direction to the dipole orientation , respectively . in the zero - temperature limit",
    "the whole liquid is superfluid and consequently the requirement of current conservation leads to the following identities @xmath45 taking into account expansion ( [ f_v ] ) and fact that differential operator @xmath46 acting on the exact vertex function raises the number of @xmath47-lines with zero frequency and vanishingly small @xmath48 we finally get @xmath49 @xmath50 in principle , absence of infrared divergences in the hydrodynamic description permits to verify the last equality within perturbation theory arguments .",
    "moreover , the behavior of every vertex function is qualitatively reproduced even on the one - loop level .",
    "finally , it should be noted that by using these two differentiation rules one can obtain the long - wavelength asymptotics of arbitrary exact vertex .",
    "particularly , for third - order vertices with two phase and one density lines we find in the limit @xmath51 @xmath52 which together with ( [ d_rho ] ) justify the effective landau hydrodynamic description of two - component dipolar bose systems .",
    "equations ( [ d_rhorho ] ) , ( [ d_phiphi ] ) and ( [ d_phirho ] ) clearly demonstrate the phonon - like behavior of two branches of excitation spectrum in the long - length limit and determine direction - dependent sound velocities in terms of matrices @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 bose - einstein condensation phenomenon -------------------------------------    within our hydrodynamic approach it is easy to find out the infrared structure of the one - particle spectrum .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this section is to derive exact low - energy asymptotic behavior of the normal @xmath56 and anomalous @xmath57 green s functions which are determined as statistically averaged values of various pairs of @xmath14-fields . for the spacial dimensionalities higher than two the above functions at equal imaginary time arguments and at large particle spacing",
    "tend to the constant @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bose condensate density of sort @xmath60 .",
    "the number of particles in the lowers single - particle state is a model - dependent quantity , which in the hydrodynamic approach can be calculated as follows ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath61 or , equivalently @xmath62 .",
    "passing to the four - momentum space @xmath63 @xmath64 and taking into account equations ( [ psi*psi ] ) , ( [ psipsi ] ) , ( [ rho_0 ] ) and our estimation for the infrared structure of the hydrodynamic action we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the applicability of the above equation is not restricted to the low - temperature limit where it generalizes the celebrated gavoret - nozires result @xcite on the mixture of bose particles , but it is also valid at finite temperatures in a condensate region . in particular , a zero - frequency limit of this formula is the extension of the josephson result @xcite which due to presence of dipole - dipole interaction possesses intriguing anisotropic behavior .",
    "the absence of the infrared divergences guarantees that in the weak - coupling limit properties of the system can be described quantitatively even within the first - order perturbation theory . in order to calculate anisotropic superfluid densities of the two - component dipolar mixture we have to collect all diagrams with two external phase lines . on the one - loop level",
    "the problem is simple since the correction to every @xmath67 vertex in this approximation is given by two diagrams ( see fig .  1 )",

    "we should add @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the same result is obtained with the help of usual dimensional regularization procedure .    in the dilute limit the leading - order contribution to the condensate depletion",
    "can be calculated in the closed form by making use of taylor series expansion of exponential and square root factors in eq .",

    "@xcite .    for specific calculations we will restrict ourselves by considering only mixtures with equal mass of different sorts of particles .",
    "this is quite a reasonable approximation for experimentally relevant two - component @xmath91dy-@xmath0dy and @xmath0dy-@xmath91er systems .",
    "particularly , in this equal - mass limit @xmath92 two branches of the excitation spectrum take a very simple form @xmath93 providing that all thermodynamic parameters of a binary dipolar bose mixture at zero temperature can be written in terms of one - dimensional integrals ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "recent experimental predictions @xcite for the scattering lengths of dysprosium and erbium condensates clearly show that the above mentioned homogeneous mixtures are unstable towards collapse .",
    "therefore , in order to demonstrate the impact of the dipole - dipole interaction on the equilibrium properties of two - component bose gases we adopt simplified model with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this model is of particular interest because such a system on the mean - field level is at the threshold of phase separation and only the presence of quantum effects recovers the thermodynamic stability of mixed state . introducing @xmath96-wave scattering lengthes @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) and typical notation @xmath99^{s/2}$ ]",
    "we are in position to write down condensate depletion @xmath100 superfluid densities @xmath101 @xmath102 and corrections to the inverse compressibility matrix @xmath103 @xmath104 as it is seen from the above calculations the mixture is always stable for @xmath105 .",
    "the sound velocity @xmath106 of the lower branch of excitation spectrum which is fully determined by the one - loop result ( [ delta_mu_aa_s ] ) , ( [ delta_mu_ab_s ] ) reveals isotropic behavior and increases with increasing of the strength of dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in the following we consider only the low - temperature limit completely ignoring densities of normal component in the superfluid . to obtain the equations of macroscopic hydrodynamics we use zisel prescription adopted from @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is the formulation of variational principle that governs the evolution of the local non - uniform densities @xmath107 and velocities fields @xmath108 , @xmath109 for two - component dipolar bosons .",
    "the appropriate lagrangian density @xmath110 necessarily contains kinetic energy term ( see eq .",

    "when minimizing action @xmath119 one should take into account the local particle number conservation laws @xmath120 ( from now on we do not write the dependence on @xmath121 explicitly ) with currents defined by @xmath122{\\bf v}^{\\perp}_a , \\rho^{z}_{ab}[n]v^{z}_b)$ ] . performing these simple calculations we obtain equations that determine conditional extremum of @xmath123 @xmath124 + \\int d{\\bf r}'\\phi^{(d)}_{ab}({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}')n'_b\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ \\left.+u_a({\\bf r})+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial \\rho^{\\perp}_{bc}[n]}{\\partial n_a}{\\bf v}^{\\perp}_b{\\bf v}^{\\perp}_c+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial \\rho^{z}_{bc}[n]}{\\partial n_a } v^{z}_bv^{z}_c\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have to be solved together with ( [ par_num_cons ] ) .",
    "few comments are in order to outline the limits of applicability of the above hydrodynamic equations .",
    "first of all , the total kinetic energy @xmath125 of two - component superfluid despite one - component case is not a quadratic form over velocities even at very low temperatures . therefore omitting higher - order terms we restrict our consideration to the distant hydrodynamic region close to the equilibrium . in practice , using procedure of section 5 it is not hard to obtain these quadruple , etc .",
    "terms by calculating appropriate vertices @xmath126 , @xmath127 , but in the experimentally relevant dilute limit their contribution are negligibly small .",
    "secondly , this semi - phenomenological formulation of the macroscopic hydrodynamics is quasi - classical by its nature which suggests the external potential @xmath115 to be a smoothly varying function of coordinates , since only in this case the so - called quantum pressure term @xmath128 is smaller than chemical potential @xmath129 $ ] .",
    "moreover , in the absence of superfluid flow ( @xmath130 ) from ( [ v_t ] ) we get the thomas - fermi stability condition for the two - component system in the non - uniform external potential .",
    "however , the obtained system of coupled equations can be easily used to detect the formation of droplets with large number of particles @xcite in mixtures with dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that the linearized equations ( [ par_num_cons ] ) , ( [ v_t ] ) correctly describe the propagation of sound - waves in the homogeneous ( @xmath131 ) system with velocities given by eq .",
    "( [ det ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the properties of binary dipolar bose condensates at zero temperature . making use of hydrodynamic description in terms of density and phase fluctuations",
    "we have found the connection between infrared anisotropic behavior of one - particle green s functions and dynamic structure factors with macroscopic parameters of two - component superfluids . within this approach",
