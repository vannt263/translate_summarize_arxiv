    "the  string topology \" theory of chas - sullivan @xcite describes a rich structure in the homology and equivariant homology of @xmath1 . the most basic operation is an intersection - type product , @xmath10 that is compatible with both the intersection product in the homology of the manifold , and the pontrjagin product in the homology of the based loop space , @xmath11 .",
    "moreover this product structure extends to a batalin - vilkovisky algebra structure on @xmath12 , and an induced lie algebra structure on the equivariant homology , @xmath13 .",
    "more recently chas and sullivan @xcite described a lie bialgebra structure on the rational reduced equivariant homology , @xmath14 , where @xmath0 is embedded as the constant loops in @xmath15 .",
    "these string topology operations and their generalizations are parameterized by combinatorial data related to fat graphs used in studying riemann surfaces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the associated field theory aspects of string topology is a subject that is still very much under investigation . in this paper",
    "we contribute to this investigation in the following two ways .",
    "recall that a two dimensional topological quantum field theory associates to an oriented compact one manifold @xmath16 a vector space @xmath17 , and to any oriented cobordism @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 a linear map @xmath21 .",
    "such an assignment is required to satisfy various well known axioms , including a gluing axiom .",
    "recall also that if @xmath22 , such a tqft structure is equivalent to a frobenius algebra structure on @xmath23 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is a unital , commutative algebra structure , @xmath24 , together with a counit ( or trace map ) @xmath25 so that the composition @xmath26 is a nondegenerate form . from the tqft point of view , the unit in the algebra , @xmath27 is the operation corresponding to a disk @xmath7 viewed as a cobordism from the empty set to the circle , and the counit @xmath25 is the operation corresponding to the disk viewed as a cobordism from the circle to the empty set . without the counit @xmath28 a frobenius algebra is equivalent to a unital , commutative algebra @xmath23 , together with a cocommutative coalgebra structure , @xmath29 without counit , where @xmath30 is a map of @xmath23-modules . from the tqft point of view",
    ", a noncounital frobenius algebra corresponds to a  positive boundary \" tqft , in the sense that operations @xmath31 are defined only when each component of the surface @xmath18 has a _ positive number of outgoing boundary components .",
    "_    let @xmath32 be a multiplicative generalized cohomology theory whose coefficient ring , @xmath33 is a graded field ( that is , every nonzero homogeneous element is invertible ) .",
    "besides usual cohomology with field coefficients , natural examples of such theories are periodic @xmath34-theory with field coefficients , or any of the morava @xmath34-theories .",
    "any multiplicative generalized cohomology theory gives rise to such a theory by appropriately localizing the coefficient ring .",
    "let @xmath3 be the associated generalized homology theory .",
    "let @xmath8 be a closed , @xmath9 - dimensional manifold which is oriented with respect to this theory .",
    "our first result , which builds on work of sullivan @xcite , is that string topology operations can be defined to give a two dimensional positive boundary tqft , with @xmath35 .",
    "[ one ] the homology of the free loop space @xmath2 has the structure of a frobenius algebra without counit .",
    "the ground field of this algebra structure is the coefficient field , @xmath36 .",
    "the construction of the tqft operations corresponding to a surface @xmath18 will involve studying spaces of maps from a fat graph @xmath37 associated to the surface to @xmath0 , and viewing that space as a finite codimension submanifold of a @xmath38 , where @xmath4 is the number of incoming boundary components of @xmath18 .",
    "we will show that this allows the construction of a thom collapse map for this embedding , which will in turn define a push - forward map @xmath39 . the operation @xmath40 will then be defined as the composition @xmath41 where @xmath42 is induced by restricting a map from @xmath37 to its outgoing boundary components .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to investigate the obstructions to constructing a homological theory applied to the loop space which supports the string topology operations , _ and _ permits the definition of a counit in the frobenius algebra structure , or equivalently , would eliminate the  positive boundary \" requirement in the tqft structure .",
    "let @xmath43 be such a conjectural theory .",
    "in some sense this would represent a  middle dimensional \" , or ",
    "semi - infinite \" homology theory associated to the loop space , because of the existence of a nonsingular form @xmath44 analogous to the interesection form on the middle dimensional homology of an even dimensional oriented manifold .",
    "we will see that defining a counit would involve the construction of a push - forward map for the embedding of constant loops @xmath45 .",
    "unlike the embeddings described above , this has _",
    "infinite _ codimension .",
    "we will argue that this infinite dimensionality will force the use of an inverse limit of homology theories , or a  pro - homology theory \" associated to the loop space . using previous work of the first author and stacey @xcite",
    ", we will show that there are obstructions to the construction of such a pro - object unless @xmath0 has an almost complex structure . in this case the tangent bundle of the loop space has a canonical complex polarization , and we will use it to define the  polarized loop space \" , @xmath46 .",
    "this space fibers over @xmath1 , where an element in the fiber over @xmath47 is a representative of the polarization of the tangent space @xmath48 . we will examine various properties of @xmath46 , including its equivariant properties .",
    "we will show that the pullback of the tangent bundle @xmath49 over @xmath46 has a filtration that will allow us to define a prospectrum @xmath50 , which we call the ( polarized )  atiyah dual \" of @xmath1 .",
    "we will end by describing how the application of an appropriate equivariant homology theory to this prospectrum should be a good candidate for studying further field theory properties of string topology .",
    "this will be the topic of future work , which will be joint with j. morava and g. segal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we will describe the type of fat graphs needed to define the string topology operations .",
    "these are chord diagrams of the sort introduced by sullivan @xcite .",
    "we will define the topology of these chord diagrams using categorical ideas of igusa @xcite@xcite .",
    "our main technical result , which we will need to prove the invariance of the operations , is that the space of chord diagrams representing surfaces of a particular diffeomorphism type is connected . in section 2",
    "we define the string topology operations and prove theorem 1 .",
    "the operations will be defined using a homotopy theoretic construction ( the  thom collapse map \" ) generalizing what was done by the first author and jones in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we describe the obstructions to the existence of a counit or trace in the frobenius algebra structure . motivated by these observations , in section 4",
    "we describe the  polarized atiyah dual \" of the loop space of an almost complex manifold , and study its properties .",
    "the authors are grateful to j. morava , g. segal , and d. sullivan for many inspiring conversations about the topics of this paper .",
    "they are also grateful to the referee for many useful suggestions .",
    "recall from @xcite @xcite that a fat graph is a graph whose vertices are at least trivalent , and where the edges coming into each vertex come equipped with a cyclic ordering .",
    "spaces of fat graphs have been used by many different authors as an extremely effective tool in studying the topology and geometry of moduli spaces of riemann surfaces .",
    "the essential feature of a fat graph is that when it is thickened , it produces a surface with boundary , which is well defined up to homeomorphism .    for our purposes , the most convenient approach to the space of fat graphs is the categorical one described by igusa @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite ( chapter 8) he defined a category",
    "@xmath51 as follows .",
    "the objects of @xmath51 are fat graphs ( with no lengths assigned to the edges ) , and the morphisms are maps of fat graphs @xmath52 ( i.e maps of the underlying simplicial complexes that preserve the cyclic orderings ) satisfying the following properties :    ( )    the inverse image of any vertex is a tree .",
    "the inverse image of an open edge is an open edge .",
    "igusa proved that the geometric realization @xmath53 is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mapping class group of genus @xmath56 surfaces with @xmath9 marked , ordered points ( theorem 8.6.3 of @xcite ) . in this theorem @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "he also proved ( theorem 8.1.17 ) that @xmath53 is homotopy equivalent to the space of _ metric fat graphs , which we denote @xmath61 , which is a simplicial space made up of fat graphs with appropriate metrics .",
    "these spaces are closely related the simplicial sets studied by culler and vogtmann @xcite and kontsevich @xcite .",
    "see @xcite chapter 8 for details .",
    "_    following @xcite there are  boundary cycles \" associated to a fat graph @xmath62 defined as follows .",
    "pick an edge and choose an orientation on it . traversing",
    "that edge in the direction of its orientation leads to a vertex .",
    "proceed with the next edge emanating from that vertex in the cyclic ordering , and give it the orientation pointing away from that vertex . continuing in this way",
    ", one traverses several edges , eventually returning to the original edge , with the original orientation .",
    "this yields a  cycle \" in the set of oriented edges and represents a boundary component .",
    "one partitions the set of all oriented edges into cycles , which enumerate the boundary components of the surface represented by @xmath62 .",
    "the cycle structure of the oriented edges completely determines the combinatorial data of the fat graph .    in a metric fat graph",
    "each boundary cycle has an orientation and a metric on it . hence introducing a marked point for each boundary cycle would yield a parameterization of the boundary components .",
    "notice that it is possible that two marked points lie on the same edge , and indeed a single point on an edge might have a ",
    "double marking \" since a single edge with its two orientations might lie in two different boundary cycles .",
    "we call the space of metric fat graphs representing surfaces of genus @xmath56 with @xmath9 boundary components , that come equipped with marked points on the the boundary cycles , @xmath63 .",
    "this is the space of _ marked _ metric fat graphs . using igusa s simplicial set construction",
    ", one sees that @xmath63 can be topologized so that the projection map that forgets the markings , @xmath64 is a quasifibration whose fiber is the space of markings on a fixed fat graph , which is homeomorphic to the torus @xmath65 .",
    "the topology of the space of marked metric fat graphs is studied in detail in @xcite with applications to specific combinatorial calculations .    for the purposes of constructing the string topology operations",
    ", we will use a particular type of fat graph due to sullivan .",
    "a  sullivan chord diagram \" of type @xmath66 is a fat graph representing a surface of genus @xmath56 with @xmath67 boundary components , that consists of a disjoint union of @xmath4 disjoint closed circles together with the disjoint union of connected trees whose endpoints lie on the circles .",
    "the cyclic orderings of the edges at the vertices must be such that each of the @xmath4 disjoint circles is a boundary cycle .",
    "these @xmath4 circles are referred to as the incoming boundary cycles , and the other @xmath5 boundary cycles are referred to as the outgoing boundary cycles .",
    "the ordering at the vertices in the diagrams that follow are indicated by the clockwise cyclic ordering of the plane .",
    "also in a sullivan chord diagram , the vertices and edges that lie on one of the @xmath4 disjoint circles will be referred to as circular vertices and circular edges respectively .",
    "the others will be referred to as ghost vertices and edges .    to define the topology on the space of metric chord diagrams , we first need to define the space of metric fat graphs , @xmath68 , of genus @xmath56 , with @xmath67 ordered boundary cycles , with the first @xmath4 distinguished as incoming , and the remaining @xmath5 distinguished as outgoing .",
    "igusa s simplicial construction of @xmath61 defines a model of @xmath68 as the geometric realization of a simplicial set .",
    "moreover this space is homotopy equivalent to the realization of the nerve of the category @xmath69 defined as above , with the additional feature that the objects come equipped with an ordering of the boundary cycles , with the first @xmath4 distinguished as incoming cycles .",
    "the morphisms must preserve this structure .    consider the space of  metric chord diagrams \" , @xmath70 defined to be the subspace of the metric fat graphs @xmath68 whose underlying graphs are sullivan chord diagrams of type @xmath66 .",
    "so if @xmath71 is the full subcategory of @xmath69 whose objects are chord diagrams of type @xmath66 , then igusa s argument shows that the space of metric chord diagrams @xmath70 is homotopy equivalent to the realization of the nerve of the category @xmath71 .",
    "given a metric chord diagram @xmath72 , there is an associated metric fat graph , @xmath73 , obtained from @xmath74 by collapsing all ghost edges .",
    "there is an induced cyclic ordering on the vertices of @xmath73 so that the collapse map @xmath75 is a map of fat graphs in @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ fig : s(c ) ] describes this collapse map .",
    "we will define a marking of a sullivan chord diagram @xmath74 to be a marking ( i.e a choice of point ) on each of the boundary cycles of the associated fat graph @xmath73 .",
    "we let @xmath76 denote the space of all marked metric chord diagrams . like with the full space of",
    "marked fat graphs , this space can be topologized in a natural way so that the projection map that forgets the markings , @xmath77 is a quasifibration , with fiber over a metric chord diagram @xmath74 equivalent to a torus @xmath78 .",
    "again , the topology of these spaces of marked chord diagrams will be studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the space of marked , metric chord diagrams @xmath79 will be used in the next section to parameterize the string topology operations .",
    "its topology , however , is far from understood .",
    "it is a proper subspace of a space homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of the mapping class group , and thus moduli space .",
    "however very little is known about the topology of this subspace .",
    "we make the following conjecture , which would say that the parameterizing spaces of string topology operations are homotopy equivalent to moduli spaces of curves , thus potentially leading to a conformal field theory type structure .",
    "* conjecture . *",
    "the inclusion @xmath80 is a homotopy equivalence , and in particular @xmath79 is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the mapping class group of a surface of genus @xmath56 with @xmath67 ordered boundary components , and the diffeomorphisms preserve the boundary components pointwise .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we will need the following property of these spaces .",
    "[ connect ] the space @xmath79 is path connected .    _",
    "_ because of quasifibration ( [ unmark ] ) , it suffices to prove that the space of _ unmarked _ metric chord diagrams @xmath70 is connected .",
    "however as remarked earlier , this space is homotopy equivalent to the nerve of the category @xmath71 .",
    "r210pt    now a morphism between objects @xmath83 and @xmath84 in a category determines a path from @xmath83 to @xmath84 in the geometric realization of its nerve .",
    "since a morphism in @xmath71 collapses trees to vertices , we refer to such morphisms as  collapses \" .",
    "now by reversing orientation , a morphism from @xmath84 to @xmath83 also determines a path from @xmath83 to @xmath84 in the geometric realization .",
    "we refer to such a morphism as an  expansion \" from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . therefore to prove this theorem it suffices to build , for any chord diagram in our space , a sequence of collapses and and expansions from it to a fixed chord diagram @xmath85 . in the following diagrams ,",
    "dashed lines will represent boundary cycles .",
    "we will choose our basepoint @xmath85 as in figure [ fig : basepoint ] .",
    "in @xmath85 , @xmath86 of the incoming circles contain only one vertex .",
    "there is also a distinguished vertex @xmath87 in the @xmath88 incoming circle ( which we refer to as the",
    " big circle \" ) .",
    "moreover @xmath89 outgoing components share the same structure : they can be traced by going from @xmath87 along a chord edge whose other",
    "vertex also lies on the big circle , going along the next circle edge in the cyclic ordering , and then going along the next chord edge back to @xmath87 . in the last outgoing boundary component positive genus",
    "is produced by pairs of chord edges twisted , as shown .",
    "( these pairs add two generators in the fundamental group of the surface but do not affect the number of boundary components , therefore they  create genus \" . )",
    "notice also that except for @xmath87 all of the vertices of @xmath85 are trivalent .",
    "so , in @xmath85 the complexity is concentrated in the big incoming circle , the last outgoing boundary circle , and one vertex @xmath87 .",
    "the ordering of the boundary cycles in @xmath85 is given by making the first incoming cycle the one containing @xmath87 .",
    "the ordering of the other incoming boundary components follows the cyclic ordering at @xmath87 ( so that in figure [ fig : basepoint ] the circle on the right will come second and the one on the left last . ) similarly the cyclic ordering at @xmath87 will give us an ordering of the outgoing boundary components ( in which the complicated boundary cycle is last ) .    to prove the theorem we start from any chord diagram ( object ) in @xmath90 and get to @xmath85 by a sequence of collapses and expansions . in our figures",
    ", the arrows follow the direction of the corresponding morphism in our category @xmath71 . note that since , in a sullivan chord diagram , the incoming boundaries are represented by disjoint circles , a chord edge between two circular vertices can not be collapsed .",
    "remember also that the ghost edges need to form a disjoint union of trees .",
    "hence if both vertices of a circular edge are part of the same tree of ghost edges ( same connected component of the ghost structure ) , this circular edge can not be collapsed .",
    "we will call an edge `` essential '' if it can not be collapsed .",
    "that is , it is either a circular edge and its collapse would create a non - trivial cycle among the ghost edges , or it is a chord edge between two circular vertices .    throughout this proof",
    ", letters from the beginning of the alphabet will be used to label edges that are on the verge of being collapsed , and letters from the end of the alphabet will be used to label edges that have just been created , via an expansion .",
    "we will start by assuming that all nonessential edges have been collapsed .",
    "l190pt    the first step will be to find a path to a chord diagram with a distinguished vertex @xmath87 , the only one with more than three edges emanating from it .",
    "choose @xmath87 to be any vertex on the first incoming boundary cycle .",
    "for any vertex @xmath91 , other than @xmath87 , having more than three edges , we will  push \" the edges of @xmath91 toward @xmath87 by a sequence of expansions and collapses .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "since all edges are essential , the vertices of any circular edge are part of the same connected component of the ghost structure .",
    "we can therefore choose a path @xmath92 from @xmath91 to @xmath87 contained completely in the the ghost structure .",
    "following figure [ fig : gamma ] , we can push the edges of @xmath91 a step closer to @xmath87 .",
    "repeating this process completes this step .",
    "we now have a distinguished vertex @xmath87 , which is the only vertex with more than one ghost edge .",
    "note that there is a unique ordering of the edges emanating from @xmath87 that is compatible with the cyclic order such that one of the circular edges of @xmath87 is first in the order , and the other circular edge is last in the order .",
    "we will think of this ordering of edges as passing from left to right .",
    "r190pt    we will next simplify the incoming circles . in this step",
    "all of the incoming cycles but the first will be brought down to one edge .",
    "notice first that all ghost edges have @xmath87 as one of their vertices",
    ". a ghost edge between two other vertices would be in itself a connected component of the ghost structure .",
    "but a circular edge joining two different components can be collapsed without creating a `` ghost cycle '' .",
    "since all the edges of our graphs are essential , we know that all ghost edges have @xmath87 as a vertex .",
    "now take any `` small '' incoming boundary circle containing more than one edge .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig:1incoming ] , the addition of an edge @xmath93 close to @xmath87 , renders @xmath23 nonessential and it can be collapsed .",
    "after this has been done , there will be three non - trivalent vertices . the procedure shown in figure [ fig:2incoming ] brings this number back down to one .",
    "observe that in this procedure there is no risk of collapsing an essential edge . repeating this process reduces the number of vertices on these incoming circles down to one per circle .",
    "notice that our chord diagram still has a unique non - trivalent vertex @xmath87 .",
    "now the @xmath86 small incoming circles have a unique vertex with a unique ghost edge linking it with @xmath87 on the big incoming circle . using their simple structure",
    "we will be able to switch the order at @xmath87 of their ghost edges and any other ghost edge ( see figure [ fig : switch ] ) .",
    "l100pt    the next step is to simplify the structure of @xmath89 outgoing boundary components ( all but the last one ) .",
    "this will be achieved by lowering the number of edges involved in the tracing of these boundary cycles to a minimum ( three edges for most ) .",
    "we will use the term ",
    "clean \" to refer to this simple form .",
    "now each of the outgoing boundaries has an edge on the big circle .",
    "( the cleaned boundaries will only have one such edge . )",
    "assume by induction that the first @xmath94 outgoing boundaries have already been cleaned .",
    "assume also that these cleaned boundaries have been pushed to the left of the big incoming circle , meaning that unique incoming edge is situated to the left of all the incoming edges associated to the uncleaned boundaries ( no uniqueness here ) and that their ghost edges at @xmath87 are attached left of all other ghost edges .",
    "assume that the cleaned boundaries have been ordered .",
    "assume also that at least two outgoing boundaries still need to be cleaned .",
    "firstly we will clean the next outgoing boundary @xmath95 and secondly we will push it left to its proper position .",
    "since all the clean boundaries are to the left , we will have two successive circular edges , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , on our big circle such that @xmath96 is part of @xmath95 the next outgoing boundary component to be cleaned , and @xmath97 belongs to @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "we will argue the case where @xmath96 is to the left of @xmath97 .",
    "the other situation is argued similarly .",
    "let @xmath91 be the common circular vertex of @xmath96 and @xmath100 and let @xmath101 be the ghost edge coming into @xmath91 .",
    "notice that the cycles representing both @xmath95 and @xmath102 include @xmath101 ( with different orientations ) .",
    "we now push all the extra edges involved in the tracing of @xmath95 to the right of @xmath101 and hence into @xmath102 . since all the ghost edges involved in the cycle representing @xmath95 start at @xmath87 and end on the big circle , the cycle traced by @xmath95 is ( @xmath103, ... ,@xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath101 , @xmath96 ) where the @xmath108 s and the @xmath109 s are ghost edges from @xmath87 to the big circle , and the @xmath110 s are circular edges on the big circle .",
    "see figure [ fig : kth ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : genus ] the start of @xmath101 is glided along the edges @xmath107 @xmath106 and @xmath105 .",
    "( @xmath101 is thickened on each of the pictures to help visualize this process . ) after these glidings @xmath95 will not include @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we can repeat this process until only @xmath101 , @xmath96 and @xmath103 are left in the tracing of @xmath95 .    to make sure",
    "we do nt interfere with this boundary cycle when making subsequent rearrangements , we will move it to the left of all the remaining uncleaned boundaries . follow figure [ fig : moving ] to see how to switch this boundary ( labelled 1 ) with the one directly on the left of it . by induction",
    "we will can clean all of the outgoing boundary but the last one .",
    "l200pt    we are now very close to our goal .",
    "we have the incoming and the outgoing boundaries in the right order and in the right form .",
    "the only issue rests with the last outgoing boundary component .",
    "the one that includes all the `` genus creating '' edges . to finally reach @xmath85 , we need to untangle these into twisted pairs .",
    "this is done by induction on the number of pairs of such edges left to untangle .",
    "choose @xmath0 to be first genus creating edge ( in the ordering at @xmath87 ) that has not yet been paired in our inductive process .",
    "our first step is to find an edge that `` crosses it '' , meaning that it starts on the right of @xmath0 at @xmath87 and ends up on the left of @xmath0 on the big circle .",
    "take @xmath111 to be the next edge at @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath111 ends up on the left of @xmath0 , we have our edge and we are ready to apply the second step .",
    "if this is not the case , we ll move @xmath111 along @xmath0 as shown in figure [ fig : untangle1 ] and consider the next edge . since both orientation of @xmath0 are part of the last boundary component , the tracing of this component moves from the edges on the right of @xmath0 to the edges on the left of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that there is at least one edge that starts on the right of @xmath0 at @xmath87 and ends on the left of @xmath0 on the big circle .",
    "so by moving through the edges @xmath111 we will find one of these crossing edges and this step will be completed .",
    "now we have our pair of edges @xmath0 and @xmath111 .",
    "but we would like to have @xmath0 and @xmath111 completely separate from the other edges as in @xmath85 .",
    "any edge @xmath112 that is intertwined with @xmath0 and @xmath111 needs to be moved .",
    "since everything on the left of @xmath0 and @xmath111 at @xmath87 is already in proper order , this @xmath112 will always start on the right of @xmath0 and @xmath111 at @xmath87 ( and end up on the big circle ) .",
    "but there are still two ways that @xmath112 might be intertwined with our pair : it could either end up between @xmath0 and @xmath111 or on the left of these edges . figure",
    "[ fig : untangle2 ] shows how to glide the edge @xmath112 along first @xmath0 and then @xmath111 .",
    "a similar operation would get rid of the edges landing between @xmath0 and @xmath111 .    before restarting these steps for isolating the next pair ,",
    "we need to bring a lot of edges back to @xmath87 .",
    "for example in figure [ fig : untangle1 ] @xmath111 ends up completely disconnected from @xmath87 and from the rest of the ghost structure . to achieve this",
    "we will first collapse all nonessential edges and then we ll reduce the number of edges on the non-@xmath87 vertices down to three as done in figure [ fig : gamma ] . note that @xmath0 and @xmath111 can be kept isolated while all of this is done .",
    "after this process , all the genus edges are paired and twisted properly .",
    "we can finally put the ghost edges connecting the small circles to @xmath87 in their correct position .",
    "our chord diagram has now one big incoming circle and a special vertex @xmath87 , the only non - trivalent vertex .",
    "it has @xmath86 small `` one - vertexed '' incoming circles linked with @xmath87 by one ghost edge landing in the last outgoing boundary cycle and ordered properly .",
    "it has @xmath89 simple outgoing boundary components positioned on the left of the big incoming circle .",

    "<S> let @xmath0 be a closed , connected manifold , and @xmath1 its loop space . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe closed string topology operations in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a generalized homology theory that supports an orientation of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that these operations give @xmath2 the structure of a unital , commutative frobenius algebra without a counit . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently they describe a positive boundary , two dimensional topological quantum field theory associated to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that there are operations corresponding to any surface with @xmath4 incoming and @xmath5 outgoing boundary components , so long as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a counit follows from the nonexistence of an operation associated to the disk , @xmath7 , viewed as a cobordism from the circle to the empty set . </S>",
    "<S> we will study homological obstructions to constructing such an operation , and show that in order for such an operation to exist , one must take @xmath2 to be an appropriate homological pro - object associated to the loop space . motivated by this , we introduce a prospectrum associated to @xmath1 when @xmath0 has an almost complex structure . </S>",
    "<S> given such a manifold its loop space has a canonical polarization of its tangent bundle , which is the fundamental feature needed to define this prospectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this as the  polarized atiyah - dual \" of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> an appropriate homology theory applied to this prospectrum would be a candidate for a theory that supports string topology operations associated to any surface , including closed surfaces .    </S>",
