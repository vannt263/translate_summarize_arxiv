    "in fact , lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 changes from a band insulator at @xmath9 to a metal by means of chemical substitution : upon electron doping.@xcite in contrast to iron - based superconductors,@xcite in the lnobis@xmath0 ( ln= la , ce , pr , nd ) parent compounds neither magnetic nor structural transitions have yet been reported , indicating that magnetism would be of less relevance to superconductivity in the bis@xmath0-based compounds as in iron - based superconductors.@xcite recently , the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been reported in ce@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 compounds with @xmath10 , while at @xmath11 a paramagnetic behavior was observed.@xcite very recently , an analysis comparing growth and characterization of lnobis@xmath0 single crystals@xcite highlights the fact that sizeable differences may exist between the nominal f - composition ( x ) and the analytical f - composition ( y ) , which is obtained characterizing the samples by x - ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis .",

    "a square - like arpes intensity distribution centered at the bz center was found , consistent with the prediction of the effective two - band model by usui et al.@xcite , who indicated that the fermi surface was close to a topological transition .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , an effective non - interacting two - orbital tight - binding model to describe the low energy physics of lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 , was proposed by usui et al . in ref .",
    "starting from a first - principles band calculation for laobis@xmath0 , where they found that the conduction bands near the fermi level consist mainly of a mixture of in - plane bi-6p and s-3p orbitals , they constructed maximally localized wannier orbitals to obtain effective tight - binding models , describing the kinetic energy part of the effective hamiltonian . extracting the portion of the bands which is relevant to the bis@xmath29 layers , assumed to be related to superconductivity , and neglecting interlayer hoppings , when focusing only on the bands that intersect the fermi level usui et al.@xcite obtained a reduced hamiltonian consisting of a two - dimensional effective two - orbital tight - binding model .",
