    "in this paper , we introduce certain energy functionals defined on ( a special class of ) knot diagrams . intuitively , these functionals correspond to ( i.e. , are mathematical models of ) a thin ( but not infinitely thin ) knotted resilient wire constrained between two parallel planes .",
    "the idea of defining energy functionals for classical knots is due to h.  k.  moffat  @xcite .",
    "it was further developed by w.  fukuhara  @xcite , j.  ohara in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , m.  h.  freedman , and z .- x .",
    "he in  @xcite , m.  h.  freedman , z .- x .",
    "he , and z.  wang in  @xcite and together with s.  bryson in  @xcite , d.  kim , r.  kusner in  @xcite , o.  karpenkov in  @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "the main underlying idea is to define a real - valued functional on the space of knots so that gradient descent along the values of the functional does not change the ambient isotopy class of the knot and leads to a well - defined minimum , which may be regarded as the normal form of the knot ( corresponding to the given functional ) ; if this gradient descent leads to the same normal form starting from any two knots in the same ambient isotopy class , we would have a solution of the knot classification problem  knots would be entirely classified by their normal forms .",
    "however , none of the functionals studied so far have achieved this ambitious goal , and most of the experts appear to be skeptical about the existence of such a functional .",
    "nevertheless , the functionals considered , in particular the mbius energy functional devised by j.  ohara , possess some important properties , for example , computer experiments show ( see @xcite ) that any knot diagram of the unknot is taken to the round circle via gradient decent along the values of the mbius energy functional , but the claim that the unknot has a unique normal form ( the circle ) has not been proved .",
    "the functionals studied in the present paper differ from those mentioned above in that they are defined on knot diagrams ( rather than knots in 3-space ) , gradient descent for them is not invariant with respect to the reidemeister @xmath2 move ( but is invariant with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , and the diagrams themselves are not curved lines ( they are like very thin solid tori lying on the plane ) .",
    "the real life prototypes of these  thin solid flat knots \" were resilient thin wires constrained between two parallel planes .",
    "they were studied experimentally by a.  b.  sossinsky in @xcite .",
    "consider a tubular flat knot of length @xmath5 and cross - section radius @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( the last inequality means `` as small as we need in the given situation '' ) ; the knot is constrained between two parallel planes at a small distance ( say @xmath8 ) from each other .",
    "let us supply the core @xmath9 ( central line ) of our knot @xmath10 with an energy functional @xmath11 consisting of two summands : @xmath12 the functional @xmath13 , which we shall call a _ uniformizational _ functional , serves to bring the core ( via gradient descent ) to a `` perfectly rounded off '' form . in this paper",
    "we consider a family of functionals depending on arbitrary continuous function @xmath0 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the oriented curvature at the point @xmath16 .",
    "the summand @xmath17 ( which we call the _ resistance _ functional ) forbids to perform deformations under which the knot type of the diagram changes ( in particular , it forbids crossing changes ) .",
    "we define it as follows @xmath18 where the sum is taken over all cycles in knot diagrams bounding a disk and such that in their consecutive intersections overpasses and underpasses alternate ( we refer to subsection  2.1 for the exact definitions ) , and by @xmath19 we denote the area of the cycle @xmath20 . further ( in subsections  2.2 and  2.3 ) , we introduce two modification of this functional that are easy to compute .    this paper is organized as follows .    in the first section",
    ", we study the uniformization functionals . in subsection  1.1",
    ", we define the family of uniformization functionals @xmath21 . in subsection 1.3 , we show how to calculate the minima of these functionals by using the gauss representation of regular curves described in subsection 1.2 . in subsection 1.4",
    ", we perform such calculations for the particular case in which the function @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that the critical curves are related to the trajectories of pendulum .",
    "we prove that all the critical trajectories are either circles passed several times , or @xmath22-shaped curves ( defined by elliptic functions ) passed several times .",
    "section  2 is dedicated to resistance functionals .",
    "we start with the general notion of resistance energy in subsection  2.1 . in subsections  2.2 and 2.3",
    ", we show how to simplify the complexity of resistance energy ( material resistance energy and its genericity modification ) . in subsection  2.4 , we show that a regular deformation of bounded genericity energy preserves the knot type .",
    "finally , in subsection  2.5 , we say a few words about the influence of material resistance energy on the shape of the normal form in the pendulum case ( i.e. , for @xmath1 ) .    in the brief concluding section 3 , we discuss the perspectives of this research and present some conjectures .",
    "in this section , instead of knot diagrams , we consider regular @xmath23-curves of constant length @xmath5 in the plane , in particular regular curves , construct various functionals on the space of such curves and investigate the normal forms given by the functionals .",
    "gradient descent along these functionals tends to make the local structure of the curves more uniform ( in a sense related to their curvature ) , and so we call them uniformization functionals",
    ".      let @xmath0 be a real continuous function satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "uniformization functional @xmath25 _ associated with the function @xmath0 is the functional defined at a regular @xmath23-curve @xmath26 ( with arclength parameter @xmath27 ) as follows @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the oriented curvature at the point @xmath16 .    in the case",
    "when @xmath28 , the resulting functional is constant on regular homotopy classes of regular @xmath23-curves and equal to the whitney index of the curve , i.e. , the number of revolutions performed by the tangent vector to the curve as its initial point goes once around the curve .",
    "let us expand the definition of uniformization functionals to the broader class of curves for which @xmath15 is not defined at all points of the given curve .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive continuous function satisfying @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath34    it is natural to suppose that the first interesting family of functionals for further study is the class associated with functions of the form @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( we shall say a few words later about the case @xmath37 and its relationship to pendulum motions ) .      consider a regular curve @xmath26 of length @xmath5 with arclength parametrization @xmath27 .",

    "suppose now that we are given a function @xmath40 .",
    "_ when does this function represent a regular curve ? _ let us briefly answer this question . consider the following three conditions on @xmath40 .",
    "since the curve is closed , we have the  coordinate  conditions : @xmath43 in addition we know that @xmath44    if the above three conditions are satisfied , then the resulting curve is regular .",
    "let us study critical points of the energy functionals @xmath25 .",
    "notice that in the gauss representation we have @xmath45 , so the functional is of the following form : @xmath46    consider a @xmath23-regular curve @xmath26 and a nonnegative @xmath23-function @xmath0 satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the gauss representation of @xmath26 .",
    "suppose @xmath40 is critical for @xmath47 .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath40 satisfies @xmath50    consider a variation @xmath51 with a small parameter @xmath52 .",
    "first , notice the following .",
    "as we vary the closed curve , the variation @xmath51 satisfies conditions  ( [ cond1 ] ) above , i.e. , the derivative @xmath53 of the corresponding integral equals zero , which is equivalent to @xmath54 secondly , for the case in which @xmath40 is a critical point , all the variations are zero .",
    "hence @xmath55 the last equation holds for any variation @xmath56 satisfying equations ( 4 ) ; therefore , we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are some constants .",
    "theorem 1.5 means that the minima of the functional @xmath25 may be found by solving ( for @xmath40 ) the differential equation ( 1 ) with the appropriate initial conditions .",
    "then the values of @xmath40 at such minima specify curves that may be regarded as normal forms of the given curve .",
    "this approach allows to obtain normal forms by direct computations not involving gradient descent along the values of the functional .",
    "let @xmath1 , then equation  ( 3 ) becomes @xmath58 after an appropriate euclidean transformation , we obtain the equation for the simple pendulum @xmath59 for some nonnegative constant @xmath60 whose physical meaning is as follows : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the length of the pendulum , and @xmath63 is the gravitational acceleration",

    "we say a few words related to this conjecture in remark  [ uniqueness ] .",
    "consider the phase portrait ( with coordinates @xmath85 ) of a pendulum ; we do not specify @xmath60 , since all the phase spaces are similar ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "* general case of full swing pendulum trajectories . *",
    "the full swing pendulum trajectories are situated in the white regions of figure 1 .",
    "let us show that in this case there are also no differentiable closed curves @xmath77 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath91 , and , therefore , @xmath92 for some integer @xmath93 ( since the tangent vectors at @xmath94 and @xmath95 must coincide ) .",
    "it is quite easy to see that on the segments @xmath96 $ ] , the value of the modulus @xmath97 is smaller than at the segments @xmath98 $ ] .",

    "* swing pendulum trajectories that are not full .",
    "* such trajectories are represented by the ovals on the phase portrait in the gray regions of figure 1 . in this case",
    "we have several closed differential curves @xmath77 .    again without loss of generality , we suppose that @xmath91 , and , therefore , @xmath100 ( since the pendulum never reaches the vertical position corresponding to unstable equilibrium ) .",

    "surprisingly , for the case @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the value of @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 seems to be integer ( numerical calculations only show that the first 1000 digits after the decimal point are zero ) .",
    "we conjecture that these cases occur not often enough to have yield new closed curves @xmath77 .",
    "let us study the case @xmath111 .",

    "the curves for the remaining even @xmath126 are homothetic to those in the case @xmath125 , since the curve is passed @xmath93 times and , therefore , its length must be @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128    here are some concluding remarks about uniformization functionals . for the case of the functionals @xmath129 for @xmath130 ,",
    "the change of the whitney index implies the unboundedness of the energy @xmath25 . and hence the gradient flow of @xmath25 ends up either at some critical point or at the singular boundary .",
    "we conjecture that in the case @xmath130 the flow never reaches the boundary and , therefore , it ends up at a critical point ( in particular this means that the whitney index is preserved by the gradient flow ) .    in the case of the pendulum",
    "( i.e. ,  @xmath131 ) , from theorem  [ shapes ] we obtain the uniqueness of the critical curve for each class of nonzero whitney index : the critical curve is a circle passed several times . in the case of a zero whitney index , we have an at least countable number of distinct critical curves .",
    "they are the @xmath22-shaped curves introduced in conjecture  [ conj ] .",
    "this case is more complicated , since we do not know which of these critical curves are stable and which are not .",

    "if the area of alternated cycles is large enough , then no resistance arises when we move the wire .",
    "resistance arises only when the area of some alternated cycle is comparable with the width of the wire .",

    "in the situation of ideal wire ( of zero width , i.e. , when @xmath161 tends to 0 ) , the support of the functional @xmath166 is contained in the set of all singular knot diagrams .",

    "anyway , the corresponding algorithms usually work with a piecewise discretization of knots , and for polygonal knots the amount of cycles is always finite .",
    "the mre - functional still has a disadvantage : small - area regions like @xmath141 may occur at some moment of the gradient flow .",
    "this will lead to an enormous increase in the complexity of the gradient calculation . in this subsection , we modify the mre - functional in such a way that one needs to study only loops , 2-gonal , triangular , and quadrangular cycles .",

    "the knot diagram ends up either as a circular braid ( which is almost a circle passed several times ) or as almost an @xmath22-shaped curve passed several times .",

    "we conjecture that the experiments will show that the normal forms obtained classify flat @xmath165-knots up to flat isotopy , but only when the number @xmath193 of crossings is small ( say @xmath194 ) .",
    "a further potentially interesting direction of study is related to the application of theorem 1 from [ 12 ] , which asserts that there is a deep relationship between normal forms of flat @xmath165-knots and those of ordinary ( 3d ) knots , in order to obtain information on the latter by using results obtained for the former .",
