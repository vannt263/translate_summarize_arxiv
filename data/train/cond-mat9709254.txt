    "in recent years , the exciton concept of electron - hole bound states has gained popularity in conjugated organic polymers .",
    "experimentally , it has been discovered that poly(phenylene vinylene ) ( ppv ) and its derivatives , e.g. , poly[2-methoxy , 5-(2 ethyl - hexoxy)-1,4 phenylene vinylene ] ( meh - ppv ) can be used as the active luminescent layer in electroluminescent light - emitting diode devices.@xcite by using different conjugated polymers , polymer light - emitting diodes ( pled ) have been fabricated which emit throughout the visible region of the spectrum.@xcite it is believed that radiative recombination of excitons gives rise to luminescence , so a comprehensive understanding of exciton properties in polymer chains is very important to guide improvements in quantum efficiency of these pled devices .",
    "also , conjugated polymers have shown potential application in photonics for their large optical nonlinearity and ultrafast response time.@xcite in view of the significant role excitons play in optical properties of a system , a detailed study of the exciton is also an important issue for polymer photonic device design .",
    "theoretically , excitons in conjugated polymers are both attractive and challenging because of the coexistence of low - dimensional confinement and strong electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) correlation in these systems .",
    "these ingredients have in fact led to many controversies during the study of excitons in polymers.@xcite    discussion of excitons in solids can be traced back more than half a century to the pioneering work by frenkel@xcite which even preceded than the band theory in solids .",
    "after numerous studies on excitons over several decades , the exciton , as an elementary excitation , has been well established in bulk insulators .",
    "this is the reason why in the existing exciton theories for polymers,@xcite the standard exciton theory in semiconductors@xcite was usually borrowed with limited justification . in these theories , the polymer is regarded as a peierls insulator which means the gap between the conduction and valence bands arises from the peierls dimerization , a well - known nesting effect in one - dimensional metals.@xcite then the exciton states are solved considering the _ e - e _ interaction as a perturbation as in traditional exciton theory .",
    "but the polymer is significantly different from the conventional semiconductor . in a semiconductor ,",
    "the electron correlation effects can largely be neglected and it is plausible to treat the _",
    "e - e _ interaction as a perturbation .",
    "however , the polymer is typically a strongly correlated system with a moderate to large on - site hubbard repulsion , and much of the band gap is due to the electron correlation rather than the dimerization.@xcite thus the foundation of existing exciton theories in conjugated polymers is not so firm , and these theories have already led to some qualitatively incorrect results .",
    "for example , from these theories , the 1@xmath0 exciton is lower than the 2@xmath5 , but typically the order should be reversed .",
    "again , the threshold of the conduction band is independent of @xmath6 , the on - site hubbard repulsion.@xcite this is unreasonable since , when an electron is excited to the conduction band , double occupation must occur and cause an additional hubbard repulsion .    having appreciated the central importance of electron correlation in polymers , several efforts have been undertaken to take account of the strong correlation effect on exciton states.@xcite in these works , numerical exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approaches are employed to handle small systems . from those numerical results ,",
    "some useful information on the electron structure of the polymer can be captured by extrapolating the results to a long chain .",
    "however , these works can not be regarded as constituting an exciton theory , since only some specific states are focused on in the calculations and the exciton is not treated as a quasi - particle .",
    "we must seek a more complete exciton theory of conjugated polymers , in which the correlation is stressed and the exciton is an elementary excitation .",
    "this kind of theory will then be useful to study the optical and transport properties related to the exciton . in this paper",
    ", we will develop a new exciton theory in the limit in which the hubbard @xmath6 is the main origin of the band gap ( i.e. , the polymer is regarded as a mott insulator ) . in this regime , the spin has little effect on the exciton states and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states is negligibly small compared with their binding energies .",
    "using scattering theory , we will analytically calculate the exciton states and find a critical strength of the _ e - e _",
    "interaction for the existence of bound exciton states .",
    "currently , chemically synthesized polymers can not be free from impurities and the `` pristine '' samples of polymers contain a non - negligible density of impurities and defects from the cross - linking , complex morphological effects , conjugation length effects , and some extrinsic defects .",
    "such impurities sometimes critically influence the properties of the system , e.g. , the transport .",
    "for example , the conductivity in _",
    "trans_-polyacetylene can be dramatically enhanced by 13 orders of magnitude by doping.@xcite in an impurity - free system , the exciton states with different center - of - mass momenta form exciton bands , and within the band the exciton moves coherently as a composite particle .",
    "the disorder tends to produce localized states , and in one - dimensional systems , any nonvanishing impurity potential will lead to a localized electronic state.@xcite thus it is interesting to examine the localization of an exciton , a composite particle , due to the impurities , and furthermore to determine if the exciton ceases to be a composite particle of electron and hole when the impurity is strong enough . in this paper",
    ", we will address the interplay of coherent motion of the exciton and different types of impurities in our conjugated polymer model .",
    "strictly speaking , the polymer is only a quasi - one dimensional system , in which interchain couplings always exist , and sometimes their effects are striking .",
    "many calculations have shown that nonlinear excitations like solitons and polarons may be unstable by taking the interchain coupling into account.@xcite recently , great attention has been paid to the interchain effects in luminescent polymers , since many experiments demonstrated that a large fraction of primary photoexcitations are interchain excitons or polaron pairs.@xcite also some theoretical calculations have been carried out to explore the interchain coupling effects on exciton properties.@xcite although the terminology of interchain exciton and intrachain exciton are widely used in current literature , these concepts are not so clearly delineated . from the principles of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the wavefunction of every eigenstate in the coupled system must be distributed over the whole system , so it is difficult to distinguish from the wavefunction which one corresponds to the interchain and which one to the intrachain exciton .",
    "we will clarify what the interchain and intrachain exciton states are , and calculate their energies and wavefunctions .",
    "photoconductivity in conjugated polymers can sometimes be greatly enhanced by intercalating or doping the polymer with a particular species of molecule .",
    "interesting examples of this phenomenon occur when meh - ppv is doped by fullerene c@xmath7 molecules.@xcite this is because the exciton , the bound electron and hole state in the polymer , will decay when the dopant molecule is introduced .",
    "the electron ( or hole ) in the exciton will transfer from the polymer chain to the doped molecule , giving rise to a free carrier .",
    "rice and gartstein recently proposed a theory to explain the ultrafast time scale for this charge transfer.@xcite from a quantum mechanics perspective , assuming we have an exciton state in the polymer chain due to photoexcitation , when the coupling between the chain and the molecule is switched on , the electron will move in the whole system ( including the chain and the molecule ) , and this state must have a lower energy than the initial state .",
    "so another point of view from which to study the charge transfer is to ask what percentage of the electron ( hole ) has transferred from the polymer chain to the dopant .",
    "this percentage should depend on the acceptor level and the coupling between the chain and the molecule , as well as the initial exciton wavefunction in the polymer chain .",
    "we will discuss this issue here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we develop an exciton theory for conjugated polymers in the strong correlation ( large hubbard @xmath6 ) approximation in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "ii.a we simplify a peierls - extended hubbard model to a model represented by spinless fermions with short - range _ e - e _ interactions in real space .",
    "then we use @xmath3 matrix scattering theory to determine the wavefunction and binding energy of exciton states analytically and derive a criterion for the existence of the @xmath0 exciton in sec .",
    "this criterion is further proved according to the levinson s theorem in scattering theory in sec .",
    "ii.c . in sec . ii.d a more formal and compact formalism for optical absorption in conjugated polymers is presented based on our exciton theory in the large-@xmath6 limit . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the impurity effects on the coherent motion of the exciton .",
    "using a suitably defined electron - hole correlation function , we study different types of impurity . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate interchain coupling effects by considering a two - chain system supplemented by nearest - neighbor interchain hopping @xmath1 and interchain _ e - e _ interaction @xmath2 .",
    "using @xmath3 matrix formalism , we analytically determine the poles corresponding to intrachain and interchain excitons , respectively .",
    "we also show the wavefunction of the interchain exciton . in sec .",
    "v , the static @xmath5 and @xmath0 excitons are used to study the charge transfer in a molecularly - doped polymer . by constructing a variational wavefunction for the whole system , the energy of this variational state , and accordingly the probability of charge transfer , can be obtained .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec . vi .",
    "in existing theories , the polymer is regarded as a peierls insulator , and then the exciton state is determined by treating the _ e - e _ interaction ( including the on - site hubbard interaction ) as a perturbation . in this picture , the single particles ( electron and hole ) are defined based on a non - interacting su - schrieffer - heeger model , so the band gap , from these theories , is independent of the _ e - e _ interaction . in a strongly correlated system , the electronic states are quite different from the non - interacting model . since the ground state is half - filled , an electron excited to the conduction band must cost the additional hubbard repulsion energy caused by the double occupation . in conjugated polymers and",
    "related organic conductors , it is now accepted that the origin of the band gap comes typically from the hubbard repulsion rather than the peierls dimerization .",
    "so the hubbard term should be given priority when one develops an exciton theory . in this section",
    ", we will regard the polymer as a mott insulator and develop the exciton theory in large-@xmath6 limit . in this energy regime ,",
    "double and higher order electron - hole excitations can be neglected because of their high energies ( @xmath8 ) , and a single configuration interaction approximation is reasonable in determining exciton states . before carrying out the calculation ,",
    "let us recall how large the hubbard @xmath6 ( in units of electronic hopping energy @xmath3 ) is in real systems : @xmath9 in conjugated polymers and @xmath10 in segregated stack charge transfer salts.@xcite strictly , this strong correlation limit is applicable only when @xmath11 , thus real conjugated polymers only marginally satisfy this approximation .      the theoretical model we consider is the peierls - extended hubbard model , i.e. , the su - schrieffer - heeger@xcite model augmented by an extended hubbard interaction . for a one - dimensional chain ,",
    "this model hamiltonian is @xmath12(c^{\\dagger}_{l\\sigma}c_{l+1\\sigma}+{\\rm h.c.})+u\\sum_l n_{l\\uparrow}n_{l\\downarrow}+v\\sum_l(\\rho_l-1)(\\rho_{l+1}-1)~.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 creates an electron of spin @xmath14 on site @xmath15 , @xmath3 is the one - electron hopping integral , @xmath16 is a bond - alternation parameter , @xmath6 and @xmath4 are respectively the on - site and nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , @xmath17 is the number operator , and @xmath18 .",
    "since we will be concerned only with electronic excitations in this work , we consider a rigid dimerized ground state as a starting point , and do not specify its explicit origin ( e.g. , _ e - e _ interactions , electron - phonon couplings , or crystal structure ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "this peierls - extended hubbard model is directly applicable only to _",
    "however , recent calculations have shown that the primary excitation in luminescent polymers like ppv can also be described within an effective linear chain model.@xcite in these luminescent polymers , the lowest excitonic wave function extends over several repeat units .",
    "the properties of exciton are therefore not very sensitive to the detailed structure within the unit cell . from the viewpoint of renormalization",
    ", we can map the complex structure of a luminescent polymer into an effective peierls - extended hubbard system with the same significant physical properties by integrating out the superfluous degrees of freedom caused by the complicated unit cell structure .",
    "we have also neglected lattice relaxation , since many experiments and theories have demonstrated that _ e - e _ interactions dominate electron - lattice interactions in many luminescent polymers.@xcite this simplification enables us to handle _ e - e _ interactions in long chains and arrive at an understanding of _ electronic states _ in conjugated polymers without loss of essential physics , although the quantitative explanation of some _ lattice _ property like vibronic structure or bond length should , indeed , take into account lattice relaxation effects.@xcite    to emphasize the electron correlation , we begin with the hubbard model @xmath19 although the exact wave function and the ground - state energy of this hamiltonian have been obtained by lieb and wu,@xcite the green s function and correlation functions are difficult to calculate directly by using the exact wave function , and it is also difficult to use their solution to study the exciton . as a practical alternative , here we make the strong correlation ( large-@xmath6 ) approximation . in this approximation , as we will see later , the band gap is essentially @xmath6 , which is not the same as the exact solution for the hubbard model by lieb and wu,@xcite where the charge excitation gap is @xmath20 $ ] . however , for the strong correlation limit @xmath21 , this difference is not important , and does not affect the exciton trends we wish to establish .",
    "the density product @xmath22 can be expressed by the on - site electron number and spin operator , and the hubbard model is rewritten as @xmath23~,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the electron spin operator at site @xmath15 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a unit vector along the spin polarization axis of the electron.@xcite    when @xmath11 , the ground state is expected to have nel order .",
    "we make an approximation by assuming that * n*@xmath27 always coincides with the @xmath28 axis , which implies that the spin excitations have been ignored .",
    "thus , in this approximation , the singlet and triplet excitons have the same energy and are not distinguishable .",
    "this is reasonable since for a one - dimensional hubbard model , the spin and charge excitations are separated when @xmath29 and by order @xmath30 for @xmath11 , and the exciton is a charge excitation .",

    "the large transition strength for the exciton state is a characteristic feature of one - dimension .",
    "as stated in the introduction , `` pristine '' samples of a polymer can not eliminate all impurities and defects .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations ( both quantum and thermal ) of the lattice are also a kind of intrinsic disorder for the electronic states in polymers.@xcite excitons represent a coherent composite particle motion of correlated electrons and holes , whereas impurities tend to produce localized wavefunction . we know that an impurity has a strong effect on transport properties in many systems , especially low - dimensional materials , so a natural question arises : how do the impurities affect the coherent motion of the exciton ?    in polymers , two kinds of impurity are often referred to in the literature.@xcite a site impurity is represented by a local potential at site 0 : @xmath196 and a bond impurity which acts on the bond between sites 0 and 1 : @xmath197 both of these impurities have very localized ( on - site ) potentials .",
    "however , for a charged impurity , its potential , in principle , may be of long - range .",

    "since the impurity competes with the coulomb interaction ( in exciton states ) differently in the two regimes ( @xmath200 or @xmath201 ) , impurity effects are expected to be different .",
    "for the site and bond impurities described above , we can rewrite them in the spinless fermion representation , giving @xmath202 @xmath203 since @xmath204 involves the creation and annihilation of an electron - hole pair , it must be less important than @xmath205 by order @xmath63 .",
    "this can be seen more clearly by using the unitary transformation @xmath206 , @xmath207 although the site impurity seems more realistic from the above analysis , we will study three kinds of impurity to arrive at a unified picture of impurity effects : @xmath208 hamiltonian @xmath209 , in which the impurity attracts the hole and repels the electron , or vice versa , imitates a local charged impurity .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath210 , in which the impurity attracts both the electron and hole , acts as a trap for particles . in hamiltonian @xmath211 , the impurity potentials are repulsive for both the electron and hole , describing a barrier effect .",
    "the last two types of impurity can be viewed as simulating the cross - linking and conjugation breaking effects in conjugated polymers .",
    "there is no translation invariance once the impurity is included , so we will work in real space and the hamiltonian we must study reads @xmath212\\gamma^{\\dag}_l\\gamma_l\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}j(1-\\delta^2)(\\gamma^{\\dag}_l\\gamma_{l+2 } + \\gamma^{\\dag}_{l+2}\\gamma_l)\\bigr\\ } + v\\sum_l(\\eta^{\\dag}_{l+1}\\eta^{\\dag}_l\\eta_l\\eta_{l+1}+ \\gamma^{\\dag}_{l+1}\\gamma^{\\dag}_l\\gamma_l\\gamma_{l+1}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\eta^{\\dag}_{l+1}\\gamma^{\\dag}_l\\gamma_l\\eta_{l+1 } -\\gamma^{\\dag}_{l+1}\\eta^{\\dag}_l\\eta_l\\gamma_{l+1 } ) + h^{\\rm imp}_i~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the key issue here is how to measure the coherence in the excitonic composite particle .",
    "we can do this by defining the correlation function between the electron and hole in the lowest state in the one electron and one hole subspace : @xmath213 where the deviations are @xmath214 and the density operators of electron and hole are @xmath215    in the impurity - free system , this correlation function ( [ cor ] ) is connected with the relative wavefunction of the lowest exciton state @xmath216 by @xmath217    when we add an impurity , the correlation is expected to decrease .",
    "the closer @xmath218 is to @xmath219 , the more correlated are the electron and hole in the lowest excitonic states , while @xmath218 approaching zero means that there is no correlation between the electron and hole ; in other words , this excitonic state has lost all its coherence .",
    "the effects of the first kind of impurity are illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , which shows the electron - hole correlation functions for different sites in a finite system of size @xmath220 .",
    "we emphasize that the parameters we use ( @xmath154 and @xmath194 ) ensure that the exciton has a very localized _ relative _ wavefunction , so that finite system corrections and the boundary condition effects are not important . in fig .",
    "5 , all the correlation functions exhibit a crossover behavior around @xmath221 .",
    "this can be understood in term of a relevant energy scale of the exciton , namely , the width of the exciton band , which equals @xmath51 .",
    "this crossover behavior , which occurs at @xmath222 , describes the localization of the exciton , i.e. , the free exciton becomes trapped .",
    "we can also calculate the charge density at the impurity site as the impurity strength increases .",
    "since in an impurity - free system the hole ( electron ) is uniformly distributed , and from our exciton theory the electron and hole do not tend to occupy the same site , the hole density at the impurity site is @xmath223 . we see a crossover again in fig .",
    "6 when @xmath224 is comparable to the bandwidth @xmath171 . after this crossover",
    ", the hole density at the impurity site approaches 1 , clearly showing that the exciton is trapped by the impurity , and the correlation between the electron and hole gradually vanishes , although , as indicated in fig .",
    "7 , they are bound together near the impurity .    for the second type of impurity , from fig .",
    "8 , a crossover is also observed if the impurity strength is similar to the exciton bandwidth , again indicating that the exciton is trapped .",
    "but when @xmath224 is larger than @xmath4 , the correlation function abruptly falls to zero , which implies the total breakdown of the exciton as a composite particle .",
    "this is because , when @xmath224 is large enough , it is a lower energy for the impurity to trap the electron and hole separately rather than the impurity trapping the hole and then the electron being trapped near the hole due to the coulomb interaction ( as for the first kind of impurity ) .",
    "thus the electron and the hole occupy the same site and they have no coulomb interaction .",
    "this is not an exciton .",
    "now we consider the third type of impurity .",
    "the correlation function behaviors in fig . 9 seem more complicated than for the other two types of impurity .",
    "the correlation function in which the hole is at the impurity site shows an analogous crossover behavior when @xmath224 is near the exciton bandwidth @xmath171 to the first and second types of impurity .",
    "however , if both the electron and the hole are left ( or right ) of the impurity , from the correlation function we see that they have not felt the impurity .",
    "on the other hand , if the electron and the hole sit on different sides of the impurity , there is a crossover at @xmath222 , but part of correlation between the electron and hole survives .",
    "the different effects of these three kinds of impurity can be further understood if we project the lowest excitonic state to the free exciton states with momentum @xmath67 .",
    "we depict in figs .",
    "10 , 11 and 12 the distribution @xmath225 , where @xmath226 , and @xmath227 is the lowest excitonic state in these three disordered systems . in the impurity - free system , the lowest state is the linear combination of exciton states with @xmath90 and @xmath228 ( they are degenerate ) . in the presence of an impurity",
    ", the exciton state will be scattered to other exciton states with different @xmath67 and the distribution of momenta will broaden from the @xmath16 function .",
    "a free exciton state with a specific @xmath67 can be defined only when the width of the distribution of momentum is narrow enough ( i.e. , the lifetime of this state is long enough ) .",
    "this is analogous to the quasi - particle in landau s fermi liquid theory.@xcite from these figures , we see that for the first and second types of impurities , after the crossover at @xmath222 the distribution in momentum space becomes so broad that we can hardly identify the original exciton state with momentum @xmath90 or @xmath228 . for the second type of impurity ,",
    "when @xmath224 is larger than @xmath4 , the final state has no distribution at all on any free exciton state , also indicating that the final state is no longer excitonic .",
    "however , for the third kind of impurity , after the crossover at @xmath222 , the distribution in momentum space still has two sharp peaks at @xmath90 and @xmath228 .",
    "this is the reason why the exciton is still coherent , as shown in the correlation functions , and in this sense the exciton can be regarded as a quasi - particle in this disordered system .      for a charged impurity , the range of ( screened coulomb ) potential",
    "can be extended over several lattice constants . as an illustration , here we consider a specific impurity potential @xmath229 its range ( @xmath198 ) is three lattice constants which is longer than that of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "the correlation functions are illustrated in fig .",
    "13 , from which we observe again a crossover around @xmath222 , indicating the free exciton becomes trapped .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath224 is sufficiently large compared to @xmath4 , the correlation functions falls further abruptly to zero , indicating the dissociation of the exciton into an uncorrelated electron - hole pair .",
    "note that this does not occur for the charged impurity @xmath209 with the on - site potential , since the impurity range is then less than the trapped exciton size . from charge densities shown in fig .",
    "14 , we find that for @xmath230 ( just after the first crossover ) , both the electron and the hole ( thus the exciton ) are trapped around the impurity . for @xmath231 ( after the correlation goes to zero ) , the hole is trapped by the impurity while the electron is repelled from the impurity .",
    "the dissociation of excitons here is easily understood .",
    "because the impurity attracts the hole and repels the electron , when the impurity strength becomes sufficiently strong , the coulomb attraction can not overcome the impurity repulsion to bind the electron and hole together .",
    "this impurity - induced exciton dissociation may be invoked to interpret impurity - enhanced photoconductivity observed in certain experiments .",
    "we can project the lowest excitonic state in the system with the impurity to free exciton states with different momenta . in fig .",
    "15 , the distribution in momentum space changes from a sharply localized one ( @xmath232 , before the crossover ) to a very broad gaussian distribution ( @xmath230 , after the crossover ) and finally goes to zero ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that the free exciton becomes trapped , then dissociates into an uncorrelated electron - hole pair with increasing impurity strength .",
    "the interchain coupling can strongly influence the energy and stability of the nonlinear excitations such as solitons and polarons .",
    "current interest in interchain coupling and the intrachain and interchain exciton crossover in polymers stems from the experimentally observed large amount of interchain excitations in luminescent polymers like ppv .",
    "however , the concept of an interchain exciton and how to distinguish the interchain and intrachain excitons , are not very clear .",
    "the wavefunction is not so useful to specify whether a state is an interchain or intrachain exciton , because the wavefunction of any state , in principle , will spread over the whole system if interchain coupling is present .    to demonstrate interchain exciton states in our approach , we study a two - chain system coupled by the nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath233 and nearest - neighbor interchain coulomb interaction , @xmath234 here @xmath235 are chain indices .",
    "now the unperturbed hamiltonian in the large-@xmath6 limit becomes @xmath236 in momentum space , this is @xmath237 which can be readily diagonalized , yielding @xmath238 here @xmath239 is the band index ( hereafter we use small @xmath240 for the chain indices , and capital @xmath241 for the band indices ) .",
    "the details of the diagonalization are given in appendix b. now we have two conduction and two valence bands with the dispersion relations @xmath242 the interaction hamiltonian now contains two parts @xmath243 the electron - hole interaction part of @xmath244 , which is relevant to the exciton state , is @xmath245 if we define local fermion operators @xmath246 we can rewrite eq .",

    "this criterion has been proven based on levinson s theorem . in our results , we have a correct ordering for @xmath5 and @xmath0 states , i.e. , @xmath317 , as observed in most conjugated polymers .",

    "the coherence of the exciton can be measured by an appropriately defined electron - hole correlation function .",
    "we have studied impurities with on - site potentials as well as a charged impurity with a more extended potential .",
    "there are three kinds of impurity with the on - site potential : the first is like a local charge , attracting holes but repelling electrons ( or vice versa ) ; the second acts as a well , attracting both electron and hole ; the third is like a barrier which repels both electron and hole .",
    "we have found that for the first and second type of impurities , the electron - hole correlations exhibit a crossover when the impurity strength @xmath224 is comparable to the exciton bandwidth @xmath171 , which describes the exciton being trapped by the impurity . for the second type of impurity , if the impurity strength is larger than the coulomb interaction @xmath4 , the deep well will trap the electron and hole separately , leading to the total de - correlation of the exciton as a particle . for the third type of impurity , the exciton coherence can survive the impurity and the distribution in momentum space has a sharp peak which means the exciton still moves freely .",

    "<S> an exciton theory for quasi - one dimensional organic materials is developed in the framework of the su - schrieffer - heeger hamiltonian augmented by short range extended hubbard interactions . within a strong electron - electron correlation approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the exciton properties are extensively studied . </S>",
    "<S> using scattering theory , we analytically obtain the exciton energy and wavefunction and derive a criterion for the existence of a @xmath0 exciton . </S>",
    "<S> we also systematically investigate the effect of impurities on the coherent motion of an exciton . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence is measured by a suitably defined electron - hole correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , for impurities with an on - site potential , a crossover behavior will occur if the impurity strength is comparable to the bandwidth of the exciton , corresponding to exciton localization . for a charged impurity with a spatially extended potential , in addition to localization the exciton will dissociate into an uncorrelated electron - hole pair when the impurity is sufficiently strong to overcome the coulomb interaction which binds the electron - hole pair . </S>",
    "<S> interchain coupling effects are also discussed by considering two polymer chains coupled through nearest - neighbor interchain hopping @xmath1 and interchain coulomb interaction @xmath2 . within the @xmath3 matrix scattering formalism , for every center - of - mass momentum , we find two poles determined only by @xmath2 , which correspond to the interchain excitons , and four poles only involving intrachain coulomb @xmath4 , which are intrachain excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the interchain exciton wavefunction is analyzed in terms of inter- and intra - chain character . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the exciton state is used to study the charge transfer from a polymer chain to an adjacent dopant molecule . from a variational wave function for the total system </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the dependence of the probability of charge transfer on the acceptor level , the hopping , and the wavefunction of the exciton . </S>"
