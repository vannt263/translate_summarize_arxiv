    "combined with the fact that it spans five orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity has provided a useful tool for numerous astrophysical applications and motivated continued study of the relation .",

    "+ in the absence of agn activity both ( f)ir and radio flux measurements are in principle unbiased tracers of star formation since the radiation in these spectral regions is not attenuated by dust as opposed to the often heavily obscured emission at ultraviolet ( uv ) or optical to near - ir ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the observation that a correlation between the ir and radio exists implies that the thermal ir dust emission and the radio continuum flux  which is a frequency - dependent mixture of thermal emission and a non - thermal synchrotron component  have a common origin . soon after the discovery of the ir - radio relation the birth and demise of massive ( @xmath135@xmath14 ) stars was identified as its likely cause ( see * ? ? ?",

    "deviations from exact proportionality of the ir and radio emission as well as changes in the ir - radio relation with cosmic time thus potentially imply changes in the mechanisms steering star formation , or that ir and radio emission are not equally good proxies of star formation under all circumstances . however , several decades after the discovery of the relation many details concerning the physical processes which shape it still need to be settled .",
    "+ a number of models to explain the global correlation between the _ integrated _ ir and radio fluxes of sfgs have been advanced : they include the calorimeter model @xcite , the ` optically thin ' scenario @xcite and the ` linearity by conspiracy ' picture of @xcite .",

    "many of these fare well in reproducing multiple aspects of the correlation but either can not satisfy all observational constraints or make predictions which still await confirmation .",
    "+ on the observational side further insight into the ( astro-)physical processes shaping the ir - radio relation has been gained by studying the ir - radio relation on small scales in resolved nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as a quantitative measure of the correlation @xcite introduced the logarithmic flux density ratio @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the rest frame fir flux  traditionally computed as a linear combination of measurements in the iras 60 and 100@xmath1 m bands under the assumption of a typical dust temperature of @xmath330k  and 3.75@xmath1710@xmath18hz is the ` central ' frequency of the fir - window ( 42.5 - 122.5@xmath1 m ) .",

    "this approach is convenient for evolutionary studies of the ir - radio relation at intermediate and high redshift as it avoids the computation of ir luminosities from a single ir flux measurement , usually made at 24@xmath1 m due to the high sensitivity of the according _ mips _ filter .",
    "however , it still requires the computation of @xmath22-corrections , if the flux densities in equation ( [ eq : monchromqs ] ) are to be given in the rest frame .",

    "this is of particular interest in view of the potential for detecting changes in the ir - radio relation brought about by relativistic cooling of cosmic ray electrons by inverse compton scattering off photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "this cooling may overwhelm  at least at low decimeter frequencies  the synchrotron losses in the ism of normal galaxies at @xmath12 0.5 @xcite if the energy density of their magnetic fields is similar in strength to that typically measured in spiral arms ( @xmath23erg@xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",

    "+ on the other hand , it could be that precisely this inability to detect sources with sfrs of ` normal ' ( disk ) galaxies at higher redshift is hiding changes in the ir / radio ratios of the sf population . in particular ,",
    "such changes are expected as soon as the energy density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) exceeds that of the galactic magnetic fields , whereupon inverse compton losses off cmb photons begin to dominate synchrotron emission .",
    "based on the typical magnetic field strengths in spiral arms ( a few @xmath1 g ) , @xcite estimate that this could be the case for regular disks as early as @xmath7 0.5 .",

    "the constancy of the ir - radio relation not only implies that ir and radio measurements are equally good tracers of star formation out to high redshift .",
    "it also suggests that the physical processes of massive star formation when the universe was only 1 - 2 gyrs old used to be strikingly similar to those at play in the local universe .",

    "similarly , a systematic study of the range of radio spectral indices in sfgs is important to quantify the inaccuracies that are introduced by assuming a single generic value .",

    "this is true not only for optically - selected agn but also for x - ray detected sources , implying that the phenomenon is not merely an artifact of our statistical colour criterion for the separation between agn and sfgs .",
    "it should be emphasized that the finding is _ not _ an artificial consequence of template fitting ; the abundance fraction of agn and sfgs has been derived using observed ir / radio ratios and hence does not involve any assumptions about the value of the radio spectral index or the shape of the ir sed .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : radio - excess outliers can only be used to single out radio - loud agn rather than a complete agn sample and , conversely , selecting only objects that follow the correlation will result in a mixture of radio - quiet agn and sfgs rather than a pure sf sample . the fact that an agn is present does not exclude coeval star formation in the host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , whether or not it is responsible for the similar in ir / radio properties of sfgs and agn is still debated , with both supporting and contesting evidence being advanced ( e.g. in the case of pg qsos : see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even though the current data set has been selected both in the ir and radio , the fact that the average ir / radio ratios of the jointly selected sample are usually close to those of the ir - selected sample suggests that the average values @xmath198 we quote are not the ` intrinsic ' value one would hope to find in an entirely unbiased sample . by separately studying an ir- and radio - selected sample of sfgs , however , it is at least possible to bracket the unbiased average ir / radio properties .",
    "as expected the jointly selected sample always lies within this region ( with the exception of one case ",

    "the shift between the average ir / radio properties of an ir- and a radio - selected sample are in principle predictable based on the dispersion of the ir - radio relation and the slope of the differential source counts ( cf . equation ( [ eq : qbias ] ) ) . while comparable to the locally measured dispersion at intermediate redshift , the scatter of the relation in our cosmos sample is significant at @xmath79 1 where it is twice as large as at low redshift .",
    "part of the increase could be due to an intrinsically higher scatter @xmath91 at high luminosities @xcite but probably is also a consequence of the limitations that are inherent in the calculation of ir luminosities when the ir sed is constrained by few points . under the simplified assumption of euclidian source counts ( @xmath199 2.5 ) equation ( [ eq : qbias ] ) predicts the offset @xmath200 0.35 dex , found in our lowest redshift bins .",
    "it also makes a fair prediction of a shift of @xmath30.7 dex between the ir- and radio - selected sample at @xmath7 1 if one accounts for the larger scatter and the finding that at faint fluxes ir @xcite and radio @xcite source counts are sub - euclidean tends to increase @xmath102 while the sub - euclidean counts ( with @xmath201 1.5 ; see references in text ) have the opposite effect ( with respect to a euclidean slope ) .",

    "the computation of ir luminosities using complete sed template libraries represents a further improvement over previous work which has often relied on single starburst templates , e.g. that of m82 .",

    "we have shown that the average ir / radio properties of ir- and radio - selected samples of galaxies differ by an amount which is in agreement with theoretical expectations and that studies relying on objects selected in only one of the two bands run the risk of inferring spurious evolutionary trends .",
