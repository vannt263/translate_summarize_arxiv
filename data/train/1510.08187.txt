    "stars form principally , and possibly exclusively , in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) which are large conglomerations of gas and dust , predominantly composed of molecular hydrogen and concentrated in the arms of spiral galaxies . with the advent of powerful new telescopes like alma with the ability to reach previously unprecedented resolutions ,",
    "it is now possible to study local clouds in greater detail than ever before .",
    "however , limited information can be obtained on the internal structure of extragalactic gmcs from observations of nearby galaxies as they typically have cloud - scale resolution .",
    "observers can partially overcome this limitation by combining data from various surveys to probe the multi - phase ism and trace star formation throughout a galaxy .",
    "there have been several multi - wavelength surveys in recent years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which have mapped the gas , dust , and stellar distribution of several nearby galaxies , including m31 and m33 .",
    "multi - wavelength studies can identify the relationship between stars and the surrounding molecular gas , and reveal whether the relations present at small scales locally , such as the @xcite scaling relations often used to describe local clouds , also exist on larger scales .",
    "the empirical scaling relations of @xcite are considered to be integral to our understanding of the fundamental nature of molecular clouds as they link three key properties which define cloud structure : the mass , size , and velocity dispersion . however , in cases where observations achieved great sensitivity and high resolution , such as the study by @xcite , molecular clouds were found to span a wide range of surface densities , in contrast with the near constant surface densities measured by @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the surface density for molecular clouds required to satisfy larson s scaling relations is only constant for a given detection threshold , and the value of the surface density is a function of that threshold .",
    "due to the varying surface density of molecular clouds , several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are now examining their clouds with respect to the relation between the size - linewidth coefficient , @xmath0 = @xmath1/@xmath2 , and the surface density , @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath3 scaling relation delineates populations of clouds which are bound , unbound , or in virial or pressure - bounded equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this relation allows us to better understand the internal structure and dynamics of molecular clouds as well as the nature of the ism environment in our own galaxy .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath3 relation can also guide our understanding of clouds in an extragalactic context , such as in the examination of the relation on global scales in a recent study by @xcite who use the relation to compare populations of clouds in different environments for several nearby galaxies .",
    "the authors find that many of the gmcs in the milky way and in nearby galaxies that satisfy the scaling relation are in virial equilibrium without external pressure confinement ; however , there is significant scatter in the data indicating that some of the clouds in these galaxies could be marginally unbound .",
    "the clouds which are highly unbound were those in the galactic centre and in the outer disc of the milky way , which suggests that environment has an effect on the virial state of molecular clouds .",
    "the effect of the environment on the structure and evolution of molecular clouds will be explored throughout this work .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the properties of clouds formed in a simulated galactic disc .",
    "we investigate how the formation and evolution of these clouds and their stars are affected by their environment . using clouds identified from synthetic column density maps ,",
    "we compare the larson and @xmath0-@xmath3 scaling relations and distributions of properties for our cloud populations to observations of molecular clouds in nearby galaxies . by studying the simulated cloud populations with respect to their location in the disc , we can determine whether the environment , particularly the galactic shear rate , affects the global properties of molecular clouds and star formation .    in section  [ sec : methods4 ] , we describe the details of the simulation and the methods by which the synthetic observations were produced and the clouds were identified . in section  [ sec : results4 ] , we present our results and conclude with a summary and discussion on the implications of our findings in section  [ sec : conclusions4 ] .",
    "using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gasoline @xcite , we simulated a large - scale galactic disc .",
    "the model we adopt is similar to the models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and includes a static galactic potential , self - gravity , mechanisms for heating and cooling , star formation , and stellar feedback .",
    "the disc properties are summarized in table  [ table : discprops ] .",
    "the total gas mass in the simulation is of the same order as that in the milky way and the spiral galaxy m33 @xcite .",
    "the overall global properties of our disc , including the molecular gas surface density ( when @xmath4 @xmath5 100 @xmath6 ) and galactic shear , are also well - matched to those for m33 @xcite .",
    "we used the same logarithmic dark matter halo potential as @xcite and @xcite to produce an approximately flat rotation curve , typical of observed spiral galaxies and described by the rotational velocity of the galactic disc , @xmath7 @xcite where @xmath8 = 220 km s@xmath9 is the constant rotational velocity at large radii chosen to be comparable to the milky way rotational velocity at the solar radius ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "@xmath11 @xmath12 = 1 kpc , the rotational velocity is constant at @xmath13 = @xmath8 .",
    "the disc was initialised with a kolmogorov turbulence spectrum , producing random velocity perturbations in the x , y , and z directions .",
    "the resulting surface density profile of the disc is truncated between 12 and 14 kpc and normalized to 14 m@xmath14 pc@xmath15 at the solar radius .",
    "we also excluded the dense , compact centre of the galaxy ( @xmath10 @xmath16 @xmath12 ) to conserve resolution in our simulation .",
    "we use the stochastic star formation criteria outlined in @xcite to determine whether a gas particle of mass @xmath17 is eligible to be converted into a star particle , which in our case represents a cluster of stars with mass @xmath18 determined by a core - to - star efficiency factor of 30% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to determine the probability that a star will form , we use a constant galactic star formation efficiency per dynamical time , @xmath19 , of 6% , which is typical for cosmological and galactic disc simulations ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt a stellar feedback prescription based on the model proposed by @xcite , where supernovae feedback energy is deposited to the ism via the nearest gas particle to the star and is converted from a non - cooling state to a radiative cooling form of energy over a timescale of 5 myr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* benincasa et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we explore a case where 10% of the total feedback energy is available to be delivered throughout the disc , corresponding to 10@xmath20 erg of energy .",
    ".properties of the global galactic disc simulation [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we consider any probabilities , @xmath21 , less than 0.05 an indication that there are statistically significant differences between the distributions .",
    "we find that every pair of distributions are statistically different , except for @xmath22 at 500 myr which has @xmath21 = 0.05 . to test the robustness of these results , we permuted the order of the clouds using a pseudorandom number generator and split the data into two distributions in four different ways : 25/75 , 50/50 , 75/25 , and by the fractional amount resulting from a division of the sorted data at a boundary of 8 kpc ( 95/5 ) .",
    "we performed two - sided ks tests on these four pairs of distributions for all properties at both 250 and 500 myr .",
    "we repeated this process 100 times and calculated the mean probabilities that the paired data could be drawn from the same distribution for each cloud property .",
    "we found that in every case , regardless of the division of data , all properties had @xmath21 @xmath23 0.5 , indicating that it is quite likely that the clouds are similar to one another overall but exhibit distinct statistical differences when they are compared in the context of their environment .",
    "observations also show that clouds in the outer disc of m33 @xcite and the milky way @xcite exhibit lower masses , sizes , and velocity dispersions than those found in the inner disc .",
    "these findings are sometimes attributed to low resolution , blending , incomplete sampling , and , for the case of the milky way , line - of - sight confusion in the determination of cloud properties in the inner disc .",
    "however , we find a real difference between the inner and outer disc cloud populations .    to determine whether our results are dependent on our choice of the boundary , we repeated our statistical comparison of the cloud distributions for the inner and outer disc using the boundary corresponding to one co scale length or one e - fold of the disc emission , which for m33 is 2.1 kpc @xcite . using the shear rate at 2.1 kpc for m33 @xcite and equation  [ eq : halopot ]",
    ", we calculate the equivalent radius in our disc at this shear rate to be approximately 5.5 kpc .",
    "we find similar results as before , although with much less pronounced differences between the inner and outer distributions than those seen for clouds within and beyond the 8 kpc boundary , which indicates that clouds in the farthest reaches of the galaxy are the most strongly affected by environmental factors .",
    "every property still has statistically significant differences with @xmath24 0.05 except for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which have ks probabilities slightly larger than 0.05 at late times .",
    "these results show that , regardless of the boundary , the properties which are most similar over the entire disc are the distributions for the size - linewidth coefficient and the virial parameter , demonstrating that , while the clouds in the inner portion of the disc can have significantly different observable properties from those in the outer disc , they will still exhibit scaling relations that are consistent regardless of environment .",
    "@xcite also studied the variation of the cloud mass distributions with galactocentric radius in m33 and found a similar result that the distributions significantly differ for inner and outer disc clouds .",
    "in particular , their observations of m33 showed that there were very few molecular clouds in the outer disc beyond 4 kpc , despite the abundance of molecular gas beyond this radius , and that the few clouds found in the outer disc had much lower masses than those within this radius , consistent with our results .",
    "molecular clouds appear to be a product of the environment in which they formed ; however , it has yet to be determined which environmental factors play a significant role in distinguishing the properties of molecular clouds between the inner and outer disc .",
    "@xcite suggest that cloud properties at small radii could differ due to strong galactic shear and less - defined spiral structure in the region and that the lack of clouds at large radii could be caused by features of the galactic disc , such as its gravitational stability and the surface density distribution of atomic gas .",
    "the observable properties ( mass , size , and velocity dispersion ) are much smaller for clouds formed in the outer disc where the external pressure ( benincasa et al . , in preparation ) is weaker .",
    "this may seem counter - intuitive as one might expect cloud size to increase with decreased external pressure , but it can be understood if we account for the effect of galactic shear by a toomre analysis of a differentially rotating disc .",
    "@xcite considered gravity , thermal pressure , and the coriolis force caused by rotation the three factors that contribute to the stability of a galactic disc . the toomre stability criterion which determines the stability boundary at which these factors are balanced is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath29 is the sound speed , and @xmath3 is the surface density of the disc . if the toomre @xmath30 parameter drops below 1 , a differentially rotating disc will be unstable to collapse . to determine the critical wavelength of a perturbation , @xmath31 , above which all perturbations are unstable",
    ", we must begin with the dispersion relation for a uniformly - rotating fluid disc with a non - zero sound speed , @xmath32 @xcite where @xmath33 is the oscillation frequency and @xmath34 is the wave number . by solving for the critical wavenumber , @xmath35 , we can then determine the corresponding wavelength , @xmath31 = 2@xmath36/@xmath35 , and subsequently the toomre mass , @xmath37    the toomre mass , @xmath38 , is analogous to the jeans mass for the case where the shear rate is an important component to stability .",
    "therefore , we expect regions of the disc unstable against gravitational collapse to form fragments with masses given by the toomre mass . since the mass is dependent on the surface density of the disc and the critical wavelength , which are both a function of @xmath10 , the mass also scales with the galactocentric radius as shown in figure  [ fg : toomremass ] .",
    "the solution for the toomre mass when @xmath33 = 0 , corresponding to an infinite timescale for collapse , is shown in figure  [ fg : toomremass ] as a black solid line and represents the line of neutral stability in the disc .",
    "our simulated disc is not pressure - supported ( @xmath39 @xmath16 0 ) in the regime where gas densities are @xmath40 = 1 - 10 @xmath6 , typical for the ism .",
    "therefore , there is a singular solution to equation  [ eq : toomre ] , representing the boundary above which the disc is stable against collapse by galactic shear .        to determine whether there is a characteristic timescale for fragmentation in the disc described by @xmath33 , we calculated solutions to equation  [ eq : mt ] for a range of collapse timescales , @xmath41 = 1/@xmath33 , and compared the results to our simulated clouds .",
    "while the toomre mass remained fairly constant throughout the disc when @xmath42 , as @xmath41 decreased , the toomre mass profile began to decrease more with increasing galactocentric radius and therefore we would expect smaller and lower mass clouds to fragment out of the outer disc .",
    "this result supports what we observe in our simulated clouds ( shown in figure  [ fg : toomremass ] as black dots ) as our population of clouds in the outer disc were found to have lower masses and sizes than those in the inner disc . by confining the cloud data within the envelope of instability created by the solution to equation  [ eq : mt ] , we find that a collapse timescale between 10 and 16 myr best describes our data with the solutions shown in figure  [ fg : toomremass ] as grey solid lines .",
    "we therefore conclude the characteristic formation timescale for clouds in our disc is @xmath43 = 13 @xmath44 3 myr .",
    "this collapse timescale is comparable to estimates for the lifetime of a molecular cloud within uncertainties ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the formation and destruction of molecular clouds are in approximate equilibrium with one another .",
    "we find the most significant effect on the properties of the molecular clouds in our disc comes from the galactic shear which causes an overall narrowing envelope of instability at large galactocentric radii , as shown by this toomre analysis . as we discovered earlier , the properties of clouds in the outer disc will have lower masses and smaller sizes and this result can be understood as an effect of their environment , due to an increasingly limited range of possible toomre masses for collapsing gas fragments at large galactocentric radii .",
    "we found that the environment , particularly the galactic shear rate , can have a significant effect on the gas properties of molecular clouds , but we have not yet explored the effect , if any , it has on the star formation . in figure  [ fg :",
    "sfr_omega ] , we show the sfr distribution for clouds in the inner ( 2 @xmath45 8 kpc , blue histogram ) and outer disc ( @xmath46 8 kpc , orange histogram ) .",
    "we find that the sfr is significantly higher in inner disc clouds than it is in outer disc clouds , indicating that the star formation is dependent on the location of their parent cloud in the disc .",
    "figure  [ fg : sfrrad ] shows the star formation rate surface density ( @xmath47 ) as a function of galactocentric radius in the disc and we find a similar profile to the shear - supported boundary for the toomre mass in figure  [ fg : toomremass ] .",
    "we have already shown that the inner disc is populated with larger , more massive clouds , a product of gravitational instabilities resulting from galactic shear .",
    "we find that the sfr and the corresponding @xmath47 can also be influenced by environmental factors as well , resulting in lower , more inefficient , star formation rates in the outer disc , due to the underlying exponential gas surface density profile of the disc .",
    "this relationship between the sfr and the gas surface density is most commonly described using the kennicutt - schmidt star formation law @xcite , where @xmath48 @xcite studied the inner discs of several nearby galaxies and found that @xmath47 was more closely correlated with the molecular h@xmath49 surface density than with the hi or total gas surface densities . however , after studying the outer discs of nearby galaxies and finding a strong trend between the hi surface density and the sfr , @xcite concluded that the hi surface density profile was a key environmental factor causing inefficient star formation in the outer discs of galaxies .",
    "we find that our simulated disc has less efficient star formation in its outer disc due to the shape of the surface density profile as it decreases with galactocentric radii , consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we simulated a large - scale galactic disc to explore the effects of environment on the structure of molecular clouds .",
    "we found that a substantial population of unbound clouds formed naturally in a galactic disc environment .",
    "we found that the distributions of properties for our clouds were consistent with those measured in observations of m33 by @xcite .",
    "we also showed that our cloud sizes , masses , and velocity dispersions satisfied the larson scaling relations , confirming the presence of these relations in clouds at extragalactic distances on global size scales .",
    "we conclude that a mixed population of bound and unbound clouds formed in a galactic disc under the influence of turbulence , gravity , galactic potential , shear , stellar feedback , and external pressure can match observations when studied in an extragalactic context .    by separating our clouds into two populations based on their location in the disc",
    ", we explored their properties in the context of their environment . using toomre analysis",
    ", we found galactic shear to be an important environmental factor affecting the upper limit of cloud properties in the outer disc , particularly due to a narrowing envelope of instability at large radii caused by a decrease in the timescales for collapse .",
    "this narrowing produces a lower toomre mass for fragmentation than in the inner disc , resulting in smaller , lower mass clouds in the outer disc .",
    "we also explored the effect of environment on stars and found that the sfr decreases with increasing galactocentric radius .",
    "since lower hi column densities are common in the outer discs of nearby galaxies @xcite and we find lower cloud surface densities in the outer disc of our simulated galaxy , we conclude that one of the most important factors for the sfr is the underlying surface density profile of the disc , consistent with observations and the kennicutt - schmidt star formation relation .    to understand the role of external pressure on our clouds , we consider the results of @xcite who used the @xmath0-@xmath3 relation to determine whether the clouds in their sample are in virial equilibrium or require pressure confinement to explain their high linewidths .",
    "these authors showed that clouds in the galactic centre @xcite and the outer milky way @xcite have high size - linewidth coefficients which can be understood as a reflection of the pressure in the surrounding medium .",
    "while some clouds can be explained with reasonable external pressures , others would require pressures @xmath50",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath51 @xmath6 k , several decades greater than the typical pressures in the ism .",
    "therefore , many of these clouds may be gravitationally unbound .",
    "although we find in our @xmath0-@xmath3 relation shown in figure  [ fg : scaling ] that @xmath52 70 % of our clouds are gravitationally bound with @xmath22 @xmath16 2 and do not require any pressure confinement , those with @xmath22 @xmath5 2 could be explained with @xmath50 @xmath5 10@xmath53 @xmath6 k , consistent with the thermal pressure throughout the disc ( benincasa et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "however , the importance of galactic shear in the disc and the effect of the total angular momentum of the clouds on @xmath22 and the retrograde population from cloud interactions leads us to conclude that these clouds are in fact unbound . also , although we do not find a correlation between the sfr and the virial parameter , we have seen indications that those with the highest sfrs are gravitationally bound , prograde clouds with low axial tilts and 1 @xmath16 @xmath22 @xmath16 2 .",
    "we will explore this further in future work to determine the role of the virial parameter and whether or not the sfr can be strongly linked to the boundedness of molecular clouds .",
