    "a quantum computer is a quantum system , so it could simulate quantum dynamics directly and efficiently  @xcite . when a quantum system undergoes a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite , induced by the variation of external parameters or coupling strength , its ground state changes dramatically and maybe , too , its entanglement .",
    "entangled states , showing quantum correlations between subsystems , are not only valuable resources in quantum information processing but also important for understanding quantum many - body systems .",
    "so much attention has been paid to a study of entanglement of quantum many - body systems in ground states or at thermal equilibrium in connection with qpts  @xcite .",
    "however , the simulation of qpts and the generation of entangled states with quantum computers are less explored .    in this paper",
    ", we address whether qpts can be simulated with adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) and how the entanglement changes when the qpt takes place .",
    "we present a way to generate an entangled state of a quantum system which undergoes a qpt during the quantum adiabatic evolution . as prototypes of qpts",
    ", we consider a spin @xmath0 xy chain and a two - dimensional spin @xmath0 ising lattice .",
    "it is shown that a product state in the paramagnetic phase is adiabatically transformed to a greenberg - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entangled state , in the ferromagnetic phase , and _",
    "vice versa_. we shows the fidelity between the ghz state and an adiabatically evolved state could be a good indicator to qpts .",
    "for a two - dimensional ising model , _ a two - dimensional _ ghz state is generated via aqc .",
    "let us start with a brief introduction to aqc  @xcite .",
    "quantum computation can be implemented by the controlled dynamics of quantum states governed by the schrdinger equation with a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath1 and quantum measurements . in a quantum circuit model ,",
    "the evolution of a quantum state is decomposed into a series of single - qubit and two - qubit gates , which can be implemented by applying external pulses and by controlling the interaction between two qubits .",
    "on the other hand , aqc relies on the adiabatic theorem , which states that an evolved quantum system will stay at its instantaneous eigenstate if the time - dependent hamiltonian changes very slowly . if the hamiltonian @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) changes slowly , then the initial state @xmath3 , taken as an eigenstate state @xmath4 of an initial hamiltonian @xmath5 at @xmath6 , evolves to @xmath7 , an eigenstate of a problem hamiltonian @xmath8 at @xmath9 . the run time @xmath10 is inversely proportional to the square of the minimum energy gap during the evolution .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless time @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "there are many ways to connect @xmath13 and @xmath14 smoothly as a function of @xmath15 , for example , simple linear or nonlinear interpolations  @xcite .",
    "a general interpolation is given by @xmath16 where two functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the boundary conditions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that a proper interpolation could reduce the run time of aqc .",
    "the hamiltonian of a spin @xmath0 xy chain in a transverse magnetic field is written as @xmath21 \\nonumber\\\\          & -\\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\sigma_{i}^{x } \\ , , \\label{hamil_xy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the total number of spins , @xmath23 the transverse magnetic field , and @xmath24 the parameter for the degree of anisotropy of spin - spin interaction . here , the coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 are exchanged for convenience as in ref .",
    "the periodic boundary condition , @xmath27 , is assumed . for @xmath28 , it becomes the ising model @xmath29 . for @xmath30 , it is called the xx model .",
    "let us recall the ground state of the ising model which undergoes the qpt at @xmath31  @xcite . if @xmath32 , the zeeman term in eq .  ( [ hamil_xy ] ) is dominant and the ground state is given by the product of eigenstates of @xmath33 , called the paramagnetic state @xmath34 where @xmath35 . in the other limit of @xmath36 , the spin - spin interaction in eq .",
    "( [ hamil_xy ] ) is important and the ground state has two - fold degeneracy .",
    "a possible ground state can be any superposition of all spin up state @xmath37 and all spin down state @xmath38",
    "where @xmath39 one possible ground state is the ghz state of @xmath22 spins @xmath40 in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath41 , the ground could be either @xmath37 or @xmath37 due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , a computer resource is _",
    "finite _ no matter whether it is classical or quantum .",
    "so we focus on the adiabatic quantum simulation of qpts and the generation of entangled states with a finite system .",
    "the spin @xmath0 xy chain is exactly solvable in the sense that its energy spectrum , ground state , and phase diagram can obtained via the mapping of spin operators to fermion operators via the jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite .",
    "recently , this system has attracted much attention in the study of the relation between entanglement and qpts .",
    "osborne and nielsen  @xcite studied the entropy of a single spin and the two - spin entanglement , where @xmath42 was taken as a ground state in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the two spin entanglement of the spin @xmath0 xy chain and showed that the concurrence as a two - spin entanglement measure exhibits the characteristic features of qpts .",
    "note that both @xmath42 and @xmath43 have the same value of the two - spin entanglement , i.e. , zero concurrence , although @xmath44 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are separable states but @xmath43 is entangled .",
    "the behavior of multi - particle entanglement at qpts is an open problem because a good entanglement measure for more than two spins is still under development  @xcite .",
    "the direct simulation of qpts via aqc might give a clue to this problem .",
    "+    for the simulation of qpts of the xy model via aqc , let us decompose the hamiltonian @xmath45 into two parts : the initial hamiltonian @xmath13 and the problem hamiltonian @xmath14 @xmath46 among various ways of connecting @xmath13 and @xmath14 , two interpolation schemes , linear and square ones , are considered to see whether a proper interpolation could reduce the run time of aqc .",
    "the linear interpolation is given by @xmath47 and the square interpolation reads @xmath48 by comparing of eqs .",
    "( [ hamil_xy ] ) , ( [ hamil_lin ] ) , and ( [ hamil_sq ] ) , one obtains the time - dependence of the magnetic field @xmath49 for the linear interpolation , and @xmath50 for the square interpolation .",

    "i.e. , @xmath54 , the system arrives at the xy critical line .",
    "the adiabatic evolution ends at @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 .",
    "we examine which of two states , eqs .",
    "( [ ferro_state ] ) and  ( [ ghz_state ] ) is the true final state by calculating the fidelity between the ghz state and an evolved state as function of @xmath15 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that wei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the maximum fidelity between a state and an untangled state as a global entanglement measure in the study of the multi - particle entanglement of a xy chain . to check the reversibility of aqc",
    ", we investigate the reverse path from the ferromagnetic phase , starting with ( [ ferro_state ] ) or  ( [ ghz_state ] ) , to the paramagnetic phase by exchanging @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    for the numerical simulation of the aqc",
    ", we develop the program which solves the schrdinger equation and diagonalizes the hamiltonian directly without the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "we simulate the spin @xmath0 xy chain with @xmath57 , and a two - dimensional ising model of size @xmath58 on a personal computer .    for the one - dimensional xy model ,",
    "the energy spectrum is obtained as function of @xmath23 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath24 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "as the free energy determines classical phase transitions , the energy gap between the ground state and the first exited state plays a key role in qpts . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) , the gap @xmath59 between the two lowest eigenvalues of the xy hamiltonian clearly vanishes at the critical line , i.e. , at @xmath54 . on this line",
    "the two lowest eigenvalues merge together and the ground state becomes degenerate , even though the system size is finite .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) plots @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the gap between the second and third lowest eigenvalues , as a function of @xmath15 at @xmath28 for @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath59 is nearly independent of @xmath22 .",
    "however , @xmath60 is more dependent on @xmath22 near the critical points @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the energy gap @xmath64 of the spin @xmath0 xy chain with infinite size is known to be @xmath65  @xcite . @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath60 can be regarded as the energy gaps between the ground state and the first excited state in the paramagnetic phase and in the ferromagnetic phase , respectively .",
    "that is @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "so the critical slowing down at the critical point  @xcite is due to @xmath60 not due to @xmath59 as @xmath41 .",
    "let us examine the universality of @xmath59 , that is , independent of @xmath24 .",
    "due to the finite size effect , the region of the universality defined by @xmath70 does not extend to the xx line , i.e. , @xmath71 for the infinite lattices .",
    "the region satisfying the universality grows with @xmath22 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the difference between the linear interpolation and the square interpolation .",
    "the linear interpolation needs more run time @xmath10 , than the square one .",
    "the main reason is that the gap @xmath60 for the square interpolation is larger at the critical region than that for the linear one , so the probability for the transition to the excited states is reduced .",
    "we find that the square interpolation could reduce the run time @xmath10 of aqc in the case of the xy chain .",

    "especially , at @xmath75 , this result is consistent with dorner _",
    "s one  @xcite .",
    "they showed that for the ising chain the paramagnetic state is transformed to the ghz state by slowly decreasing the magnetic field @xmath23 .",
    "although due to the finite size effect , the fidelity decreases near the xx critical line , it is almost independent of of @xmath24 .",
    "this is one of the characteristic features of qpts , called the universality . as mentioned before ,",
    "the region of the universality is dependent on the number of spins @xmath22 .",
    "let us discuss the reversibility of the qpt .",
    "the paramagnetic state is adiabatically transformed to the ghz state in the ferromagnetic phase by decreasing @xmath23 .",
    "does the ghz state evolve adiabatically to the paramagnetic state ( [ para_state ] ) even though there is the energy level splitting at the xy critical line ? by exchanging @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the reverse evolution , the return path ( ii ) in fig .",

    "the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition takes place at @xmath80 .",
    "we find that in spite of the energy level merging and splitting during the journey , the paramagnetic state is adiabatically transformed to the ghz state and _ vice versa _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) .",
    "let us discuss the effect of finite system size on the aqc simulation of qpts and the generation of entangled states .",
    "although the system considered here is finite , it could show important features of qpts .",
    "first , qpts are characterized by the energy level crossing or avoided crossing  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) shows energy level crossings at @xmath54 .",
    "second , a @xmath81 spin chain exhibits the universality , which state that the physics is independent of @xmath24 for @xmath82 .",

    "one unsolved issue is that the entanglement of the ground state in the ferromagnetic phase . if either @xmath37 or @xmath38 is the ground state in the ferromagnetic phase , there is no entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state @xmath43 is a multi - particle entangled state . in this case ,",
    "the single - site entropy varies from @xmath83 at the paramagnetic phase to @xmath84 in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this is in contrast with the result of  @xcite .",
    "a related question is whether the entanglement of the ground state in ferromagnetic or paramagnetic phase is constant or dependent on @xmath23 . in other words , does entanglement change abruptly only at the critical point ?",
    "let us turn to the two - dimensional ising model to produce the two - dimensional ghz state @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the spin - up state at the lattice site @xmath87 and @xmath88 . as illustrated in fig .",

    "we have considered the one - dimensional xy model and the two - dimensional ising model and simulated the qpts and the generation of an entangled state via aqc .",
    "although the system size is finite , our results show the characteristic features of qpts .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the paramagnetic state evolves adiabatically to the ghz state in the ferromagnetic phase and vice versa .",
    "the generation of entangled states via aqc is simple in the sense that only the external magnetic field is turned off or on slowly .",

    "one open issue in aqc is that the minimum energy gap , which determine the run time @xmath10 , should be known before running .",
