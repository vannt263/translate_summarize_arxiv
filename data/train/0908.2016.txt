    "<S> using the analytic and experimental techniques we present an exploratory study of the mass distribution features of the high coincidence of centre of mass of heterogeneous bone tissue in vivo and its centroid of geometry position . </S>",
    "<S> a geometric concept of the average distribution radius of bone issue is proposed and functional relation of this geometric distribution feature between the partition density and its relative tissue average distribution radius is observed . </S>",
    "<S> based upon the mass distribution feature , our results suggest a relative distance assessment index between the center of mass of cortical bone and the bone center of mass and establish a bone strength equation . analysing the data of human foot in vivo </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that the mass and geometric distribution laws have expanded the connotation of wolff s law , which implies a leap towards the quantitative description of bone strength . </S>",
    "<S> we finally conclude that this will not only make a positive contribution to help assess osteoporosis , but will also provide guidance to exercise prescription to the osteoporosis patients .    </S>",
    "<S> bone tissue structure and function are largely associated with its mechanical and biological environment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> growth , modeling and remodeling are the basic physiological features of bone . </S>",
    "<S> biomechanically , bone growth is defined as mass changes @xcite , and mechanical force and movement play a role in bone growth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the skeleton bears loads externally , bone tissue will undergo adaptive changes such as reabsorption or remodeling @xcite , and point - to - point changes to the material property by changing mass distribution @xcite will maximize its external loads . </S>",
    "<S> individual bone growth indicates that external force has great effect on cross - sectional geometry and internal anatomy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bone structure is an optimization of stress transformation @xcite and it is an adaptive response to incorporation of minimal weight to maximal strength by some special rules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bone physiological activity is regarded as a process of optimization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , stress has caused adaptive changes of bone shape and structure , which involve constant optimization of structures . </S>",
    "<S> but it remains unclear what distribution principle these changes follow .    from the biomechanical perspective </S>",
    "<S> , osteoporosis means a sharp drop of bone mass and strength and they can not meet the demands of adaptive strength and movement load @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many mechanical models adequately represent the relation between the bone geometry and its strength @xcite , as well as the correlation between bone density and its strength @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the phenomenological models may often be helpful in obtaining a qualitative understanding of the data , microscopically these models do not provide a trustworthy guide into unknown territory of an accurate relation between the distribution of bone tissue and its strength . </S>",
    "<S> our approach will be to use a combination analysis of analytic and experimental techniques to examine the the above two uncertain areas by setting up a bone strength equation to obtain a quantitative description macroscopically .    </S>",
    "<S> centroid of geometry ( hereinafter referred to as cog ) and the center of mass ( hereinafter referred to as com ) of the homogeneous materials are coincide , whereas in most cases those of heterogeneous do not . </S>",
    "<S> using ct ( computed tomography ) scan technology , we conducted the analysis to explore the relation between com and cog of bone in the physiological activities , such as continuous modeling and remodeling in its adaptive mechanical condition . </S>",
    "<S> at small enough ct resolution rate and its slice distance , the bone tissue density of infinitesimal bone volume segmentation , @xmath0 , can be regraded as continuous . </S>",
    "<S> its point density @xmath1 can be taken as that of the micro - element , @xmath2 , thereby approximating the bone as a collection of particles . to find the optimal program for heterogeneous bone tissue mass distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we minimize @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the relative locations of coordinators of bone com and random point related to ct image , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the series @xmath6 are all convergent . thus in the limit @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the abelian theorem on series @xcite leads to @xmath12 where we have used @xmath13 for the cog . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the optimal program for the heterogeneous bone tissue mass distribution should be the coincidence of its com and cog . </S>",
    "<S> this signature does not , however , indicate a similar behaviour of the tissue distribution of bone in vive . in order to study the relation between the com and cog of bone in vive , a ct scanning , pixel size : @xmath14 , slice distance @xmath15 ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> is conducted to the foot of eight volleyballers , eight classical wrestlers and two senior females .    . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] basic information of the subjects . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the position of cog is calculated by @xmath16 and that of com by @xmath17 the comparative testing accurate distance between com and cog positions is evaluated using @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath21 the ct image resolution , @xmath22 the slice distance </S>",
    "<S> .    fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] collects and displays our data shown in table [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] confirms our signature that the high coincidence of the position of com and cog of heterogeneous bone in vive is independent of the changing process of bone in its adaptive mechanical environment and that the bone tissue mass distribution observes the optimal principle with a coincidence between com and cog .    </S>",
    "<S> the above signature brings us to the issue of mass distribution index of bone tissue . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical properties reveal that the elastic property and pressure - bearing strength of cortical bone is several times more than those of the same - volume spongial bone @xcite . using the mechanical insight </S>",
    "<S> , we divide the tissue continuous density into three parts ; bone marrow , spongial bone and compact bone with their com and cog highly coincident as indicated by the observed fact @xmath23 . using @xmath24 , where @xmath25 refer to com of bone tissue and @xmath26 refers to com of calcaneus </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the distance between each individual tissue com and that of the calcaneus . in order to avoid the effect from the size of the subject s calcaneus </S>",
    "<S> , we standardize the average distribution radius of calcaneus so as to compare calcaneus of different volume , thereby establishing an anastz for the distribution index : @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for bone marrow , spongial bone and compact bone respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 refers to all the tissues that make up bone and @xmath22 stands for com .    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] it is clear that the position of compact bone com of the volleyballers is closest to that of the calcaneus com . </S>",
    "<S> distinct difference exists between the volleyballers and wrestlers , so is the difference between the senior females and the volleyballers and wrestlers . </S>",
    "<S> the distance of the senior females is the largest . </S>",
    "<S> if such a trend continues for larger sample sizes , it will add one more quantitative evaluation index while diagnosing osteoporosis .    to see whether the changes of bmc ( bone mineral content ) and bmd ( bone mineral density ) bring about changes in the geometric distribution of bone tissue simultaneously , we segment the density @xmath1 and use @xmath30 to calculate the average distribution radius of the relative tissue of segmented density to the calcaneus com . when the continuity of segment density is guaranteed and the calcaneous density variation ranges are fixed , the relation between the calcaneous density and the average bone tissue distribution radius has been developed . after an analysis of the fitting function , we establish a functional relationship between the two for a typical value of correlation coefficient @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the obvious difference of average distribution radii between the senior females and the athletes . for the density @xmath32 , the average distribution radius of the senior females drops dramatically . when comparing the wrestlers and the volleyballers , when the density is greater than 2.0 , the bone tissue average distribution radius of the volleyballers is more than that of the wrestlers . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , when the geometrical distribution of bone tissue follows eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn2 ] ) , senior females bone loss will be accompanied by a decrease of distribution radius of compact bone . </S>",
    "<S> when comparing the volleyballers and wrestlers , there will be an apparent increase of distribution radius of compact bone . </S>",
    "<S> we may safely say that the bone adaptability includes not only changes of bmc and bmd , but also changes in radius of bone tissue distribution . </S>",
    "<S> once the bone shape , tissue density and their corresponding volume have been determined , the tissue geometric distribution will determine the strength of bone tissue . </S>",
    "<S> the moment of inertia of bone is an important index to reflect bone strength . for the heterogeneous materials the bone density and intensity follow a non - linear relationship . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a coefficient @xmath33 and combine the segmented density and intensity to calculate the segmented strength on the basis of moment of inertia    @xmath34    and establish a functional relation between the calcaneus bone strength and the segmented density as @xmath35 where @xmath36 refers to strength of calcaneus , @xmath37 . when @xmath38 is small enough , and @xmath39 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn4 ] can be approximated by @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 refer to the maximal value of compact bone density and the minimal value of spongial bone density , respectively and @xmath43 is the coefficient parameter of bone density and strength . note that the above equation holds for continuous heterogeneous material only .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows that when the bone tissue density of wrestlers and volleyballers is greater than 1.8 , the difference in intensity between the two grows and reaches its maximum in the range of @xmath44 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the bone intensity of the senior females begins to show a larger difference with that of the athletes for density @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning bone tissue distribution , our study confirms that the high coincidence of com and cog of heterogeneous material . </S>",
    "<S> this coincidence is the prerequisite to meet the requirement of max - min - principle and forms the bases for developing an evaluation index . </S>",
    "<S> we noticed that there is no difference in spongial bone between the wrestlers and volleyballers , whereas there is obvious difference in compact bone . </S>",
    "<S> this would explain the movement of the compact bone com towards the calcaneus com , which enables the calcaneus structure to bear greater stress . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be a representation that bone can yield adaptive changes functionally . what s more significant is the fact that the compact bone com of the senior females moves away from the calcaneus com . </S>",
    "<S> if a larger size sample can verify this , it will bring greater significance to the clinical practice .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main aims of bone study is to conduct qualitative analysis to bone strength . </S>",
    "<S> bone strength relies on bone mass , but the uni - index of bone mass can not paint a holistic and realistic picture of bone intensity objectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> modeling analysis reveals that the main factors that determine the structure strength include mass distribution , geometric distribution and moment of inertia of various tissues @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn4 ] ) has successfully combined those factors and from a mathematical perspective it has illustrated that volume , mass , density , distribution radius and moment of inertia of bone tissue can not be employed individually to assess bone strength . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn4 ] ) also reveals that criteria of selecting a training approach to increase or improve bone mass of compact bone and its distribution radius that are clinically significant . </S>",
    "<S> the bone tissue geometric distribution principle sheds light on the effect to bone structure from different types of training . a geometrically - distributed bone strength equation can mirror the effects to bone strength from various factors . </S>",
    "<S> when the physiological bone mass decrease has become unavoidable , will exercise patterns be able to change its geometric distribution ? </S>",
    "<S> if yes , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn4 ] ) will undoubtedly provide some guidance to the development of exercise prescription and it can also be employed as an important evidence to examine and modify exercise prescription . </S>"
