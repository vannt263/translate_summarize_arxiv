    "one of the biggest interest in astrophysics is to understand how structures in the universe are formed .",
    "observations reveal that the universe is not simply homogeneous and isotropic but contains rich structures from stars to the large scale structure such as clusters of galaxies , super - clusters , the great wall and voids in it .",
    "although the gravity itself does not have any particular scale , several physical scales associated with the structure formation , such as the jeans scale , the silk damping scale and the horizon scale at the matter - radiation equality epoch , are derived by the inclusion of an effect of primeval radiation @xcite . among them , the jeans scale determines whether small density fluctuations can grow against pressure or not .",

    "therefore an investigation of the time evolution of the jeans scale is crucial in particular for the study what is the first collapsed object in the universe .",
    "the jeans scale is ruled by the sound speed @xmath2 and the free fall time of the object or the expansion time of the universe .",
    "after the recombination of hydrogen atoms , the radiation pressure becomes ineffective and equations of state are described by the adiabatic index @xmath0 of baryonic matter .",
    "if the energy transfer between the baryon and the photon is efficient , we expect isothermal process , i.e. , @xmath3",
    ". however , if the time scale of the energy transfer becomes longer than the oscillation time scale of the sound wave , the adiabatic @xmath4 must be achieved .",
    "these two @xmath0 s give about factor two difference for the jeans scales in mass .",
    "this point is crucial when we investigate the evolution of the baryon density perturbations smaller than the jeans scale after recombination .",

    "we consider a system of non - relativistic particles ( baryons and electrons ) and photons which interact only with the electrons .",
    "neutral and ionized hydrogen atoms and neutral helium atoms are taken into account as baryonic components .",

    "as an application of the basic relations obtained in the previous sections , we consider the behavior of the sound wave of the baryon - electron fluid after the recombination epoch .",
    "neglecting a perturbation of the gravitational potential , we get basic equations from eqs.([conteqc ] ) , ( [ eulereqc ] ) , ( [ energeqc ] ) as @xmath130 and @xmath131 here we have also neglected a perturbation of the ionization fraction and an interaction with the photon in the euler equation because the momentum transfer rate is so small after the decoupling the wave equation is derived from eqs.([contappl ] ) and ( [ eulerappl ] ) , together with eq.([eqst1 ] ) , as @xmath132 this must be coupled with the energy equation ( [ energappl ] ) in order to investigate the sound oscillation of the baryon - electron fluid .",
    "now let us omit the time - dependence of the background quantities . when the time scale of the sound oscillation is shorter than the hubble time , this is a good approximation . then eqs.([deltabappl ] ) and ( [ energappl ] ) reduce to simple equations @xmath133 where we took the fourier mode expansion by setting @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",

    "it may be instructive to show the solution of eq.([dispersionb ] ) in a simple form with some approximation .",
    "expanding the solution around the adiabatic state , i.e. , expanding in terms of @xmath147 by setting the solution @xmath148 , we find @xmath149    it is interesting to clarify the behavior of the adiabatic index @xmath0 in the expanding universe after the recombination , which we demonstrate as an example of the usefulness of our formalism in the below . as is clear from eq.([dispersiona ] ) , the adiabatic index @xmath0 is ruled by the ratio of the compton energy transfer time scale @xmath122 to the sound oscillation time scale . if @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . on the other hand , if @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "therefore the sound speed depends on scales of the perturbations , and it is expected that @xmath0 is changed from @xmath156 to @xmath157 as the universe expands .    fig.1 shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath158 by directly solving eq.([dispersionb ] ) .",
    "the ionization fraction is calculated properly by solving the recombination process in the expanding universe with the cosmological parameters in the figure caption@xcite .",
    "as is expected , @xmath0 is changed from @xmath156 to @xmath157 in the earlier stage of the universe for smaller scale perturbations .    to get a physical insight",
    ", we refer to the familiar illustrative figure , fig.2 , which gives temporal variations of various physical sizes in the expanding universe .",
    "the definitions of the curves are summarized in appendix b. ( see also ref.@xcite . ) the adiabatic index @xmath0 after the recombination is changed when the compton energy transfer time is equal to the sound oscillation time scale . in this figure",
    ", we show the line on which the two time scales are equal , i.e. , @xmath159 .",
    "note that we use the ( baryon ) mass scale in the unit of the solar mass instead of @xmath160 , with employing the relation @xmath161 .",
    "the mass and the comoving wave number which satisfy the relation @xmath159 are expressed ( see also appendix b ) , @xmath162 where we set the temperature of the microwave background at present @xmath163k , @xmath164 is the baryon temperature in unit of kelvin , and @xmath165 .    as is shown in fig.2 , the jeans scale after the recombination has the plateau . in this stage",
    "the energy transfer between background photons and the baryon fluid is effective through the residual electrons , and the matter temperature follows the photon temperature . as the universe expands , however , the energy transfer time rises above the hubble expansion time .",
    "after that epoch the matter temperature cools adiabatically and drops as @xmath166 .",
    "the broken corner of the plateau is the critical time that the two time scales become equal , where this epoch is roughly estimated as @xmath167 @xcite ( see also appendix c ) .",
    "the line of @xmath159 crosses at the broken corner of the plateau of the jeans mass scale .",
    "this necessarily happens because of the following reason .",
    "the jeans scale is the scale at which the sound oscillation time is equal to the free fall time of the perturbation or the hubble expansion time . since the broken corner of the plateau is the epoch when the hubble expansion time is equal to the energy transfer time through the compton interaction between the background photons and the baryon - electron fluid , the cross point of two lines is the point when the sound oscillation time , the hubble expansion time and the energy transfer time become all same .",
    "now let us discuss an interesting result derived from the dispersion relation ( [ dispersiona ] ) . as it is apparent from the approximated solution , eq.([solapprox ] ) , @xmath168 generally has an imaginary part .",
    "this imaginary part of @xmath168 represents the exponential damping of the wave oscillation if @xmath169 .",
    "since the period of the sound oscillation is @xmath170 , the damping factor for the amplitude during one period is @xmath171.\\ ] ] we show the behavior of @xmath172 in fig.3 , in the similar way to fig.1 as the function of @xmath158 .",
    "as is shown in fig.3 , this damping phenomenon may have an effect on the evolution of baryon perturbations .",
    "we should be notice that our discussions here are based on the assumption that the solutions have the wave form .",
    "in other word , this damping process is effective only inside the jeans scale .    in order to understand this damping mechanism",
    ", we show another aspect of the solutions of eq.([cubiceqa ] ) . introducing @xmath173 , @xmath174",
    ", we take the solution @xmath175 the initial value is @xmath176 . here",
    "@xmath168 is obtained by solving the dispersion relation eq.([dispersiona ] ) . for @xmath177 and @xmath178 ,",
    "solutions are mere harmonic oscillations with no damping . therefore the solutions around @xmath179 should be investigated . by employing eqs .",
    "( [ deltabapplb ] ) and ( [ eqst1 ] ) , the trajectories of the solutions on @xmath180-plane are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath181 and the vertical axis is @xmath182 .",
    "the non - dimensional quantity @xmath183 is the unique physical parameter of the equation .",
    "we have chosen @xmath184 in fig.4 .    from the relation @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the volume for unit particle number",
    ", the horizontal axis can be regarded as the change of volume per unit particle number .",
    "thus we can regard the trajectories in fig.4 in the similar way to the thermodynamical cycles in ( pressure - volume)-plane .",
    "the damping of the oscillation is in proportion to the deviation in one cycle .",
    "the most significant damping occurs when @xmath187 ( fig.4(b ) ) .",
    "the damping does not happen if the deviation in one cycle is negligible as we can see in fig.4(d ) .",
    "we have formulated equations for a fluid system with the electron , neutral and ionized hydrogen atoms and neutral helium atoms with taking into account the energy transfer between the background photons and the residual electrons through the compton interaction . using this formulation ,",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the sound speed and the jeans scale after the recombination .",
    "we found that the behavior of the adiabatic index @xmath0 after the recombination is controlled by the ratio of the compton energy transfer time scale to the sound oscillation time scale .",
    "then @xmath0 ( or the sound speed ) depends on scales of the perturbations , and is changed from @xmath156 to @xmath157 in earlier stage for smaller scale perturbations .",
    "this formalism enables us to calculate the linear evolution of the very small scale baryon density perturbations @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed the small damping feature of the sound oscillation when @xmath0 changes from @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    "this effect works inside the jeans scale and seems to be negligible on scales @xmath188 .",
    "if early reionization occurs , however , the ionization fraction and the jeans scale increase .",
    "and @xmath0 changes from @xmath157 to @xmath156 .",
    "the damping of the baryon perturbation would be effective on larger scales during the process of the reionization of the universe .",
    "it has been pointed out that the neutral gas cloud could have an instability in a specific photon background @xcite .",
    "since we have not consider the specific situation in our paper , an unstable mode does not appear in our equations . in the present paper",
    "we have also neglected perturbations to the ionization fraction .",
    "future work may be required on this point .",
    "it will be important to quantify the limitation of our formalism .",
    "our basic assumption is the fact that the baryon - electron system is treated as tightly coupled single - fluid .",
    "this assumption becomes not being correct when the collision time scale of neutral interaction rises above the hubble expansion time .",
    "this epoch can be estimated in the following way @xcite .",
    "the matter temperature can be written as @xmath189[k ] , after the energy transfer through the compton interaction becomes ineffective ( see appendix c ) .",
    "then the mean free time for collision between neutral hydrogen atoms is @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the cross section of neutral atoms @xmath192 ( @xmath193 is the bohr radius ) , and @xmath194 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath195 to the hubble expansion time is therefore expressed as @xmath196 . eventually we get the red - shift at @xmath197 as @xmath198 .",
    "this is small enough as long as we consider the linear stage of the density perturbations .",
    "numerical simulations and semi - analytic calculations of structure formation employ the linear matter power spectrum as their initial conditions .",
    "this linear matter spectrum is usually calculated without taking into account the baryon pressure term after the recombination .",
    "it is appropriate , however , only if the structures which are larger than the jeans scale are considered .",
    "according to the hierarchical clustering scenario , smaller objects are formed earlier than larger ones .",
    "we expect the scale of the first collapsing object is very close to the jeans scale .",
    "therefore very accurate estimate of the matter spectrum including the baryon pressure term is necessary to understand the early formation of bound objects @xcite .",
    "once the first collapsing objects are formed , they may cool down through formation of hydrogen molecules and may fragment into smaller radiating objects like stars and/or quasars @xcite .",
    "the first radiating objects formed strmgren sphere around them @xcite and may eventually ionize all the surrounding gas by uv radiation .",
    "this reionization process changes the jeans scale @xcite .",
