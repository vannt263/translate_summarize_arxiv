    "the difference between @xmath160 in our results comes from the renormalization of the matrix elements of the operators in the weak hamiltonian .",

    "as regards the ratio between the asymmetries , we have found a ratio equal to 1.61(1.63 ) .",

    "just discussed , it is vital to realize that the effect of @xmath26 mixing in the @xmath24 decay is to remove any ambiguity concerning the strong phase , @xmath8 .",

    "we plot the role of @xmath1 mixing in our calculations .",
    "we stress that , even though one has a large value of @xmath8 around @xmath189 with no @xmath1 mixing , one still has a very small value for @xmath76 ( fig.4 ) , and hence the cp violating asymmetry , @xmath4 , remains very small in that case .",

    "we define the ratio @xmath208 as : @xmath209 and , without taking into account the penguin contribution , one has , @xmath210      the latest experimental data from the cleo collaboration  @xcite are : @xmath211 we have calculated the branching ratios for @xmath212 and for @xmath213 for all models as a function of @xmath3 . in figs.5 and 6 , we show the results for models 1 and 2 in order to make the dependence on form factors explicit .",
    "the numerical results are very sensitive to uncertainties coming from the experimental data . for the branching ratio @xmath212 ( fig.5 )",
    ", we have a large range of values of @xmath3 and the ckm matrix elements over which the theoretical results are consistent with the experimental data from cleo .",
    "however , all models do not give the same result : models 2 and 4 are very close to the experimental data for a large range of @xmath3 , whereas models 1,3 and 5 are not .",
    "the reason is still the magnitude of the form factors . as a result",
    ", we have to exclude models 1,3 and 5 because their form factors are too small .",
    "if we consider numerical results for branching ratio @xmath200 ( fig.6 ) , it appears that all models are consistent with the experimental data for a large range of @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of @xmath26 mixing ( included in our calculations ) on the branching ratio @xmath200 is around @xmath214 .",
    "numerical results for models 1 , 3 , 5 and models 2 , 4 are very close to each other .",
    "the difference between the two branching ratios can be explained by the fact that for the @xmath212 decay , the tree and penguin contributions are both proportional to only one form factor , @xmath177 .",
    "thus , this branching ratio is very sensitive to the magnitude of this form factor ( @xmath177 is related to @xmath215 or @xmath216 in models ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,4 ) respectively ) . on the other hand , for the decay @xmath200 ,",
    "both @xmath177 and @xmath217 are included in the tree and penguin amplitudes , and this branching ratio is less sensitive to the magnitude of the form factors .",
    "if we look at the ratio @xmath208 between these two branching ratios , @xmath218 and @xmath219  shown in fig.7  the results indicate that @xmath208 is very sensitive to the magnitude of the form factors , and that there is a large difference between models 1 , 3 , 5 and models 2 and 4 .",
    "we investigated the ratio @xmath208 for the limiting ckm matrix elements as a function of @xmath3 , finding that @xmath208 is consistent with the experimental data over the range @xmath3 : @xmath220 , ( the values outside(inside ) brackets correspond to the choice @xmath221 ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath208 , in particular , is not very sensitive to the ckm matrix elements .",
    "the small difference which does appear , comes from the penguin contributions ( which may be neglected ) .",
    "if we just take into account the tree contributions in our calculations , @xmath208 is clearly independent of the ckm matrix elements ( eq.42 ) .    from a comparison of the numerical results and the experimental data",
    ", we can extract a range of @xmath3 , within which all results are consistent . in table 3 , we have summarized the allowed range of @xmath3 for @xmath213 , @xmath212 and @xmath208 , for models 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 according to various choices of the ckm matrix elements . to determine the best range of @xmath3 , we have to find some intersection of the values of @xmath3 for each model and for each set of ckm matrix elements , for which the theoretical and experimental results are consistent .",
    "this is possible and the results are shown in table 4 . in our study , it seems better to use the range intersection @xmath222 than @xmath223 , for fixing the final interval @xmath3 , since the experimental uncertainties are smaller in the former case , and since we are working to the first order of isospin violation ( @xmath26 mixing ) . finally , after excluding models 1,3 and 5 , which are not consistent with all the experimental data , we are able to fix the upper and lower limit of the range of @xmath3 , using the limiting values of the ckm matrix elements ( table 5 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath3 should be in the range @xmath220 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 correspond to @xmath168 and @xmath166 respectively .",
    "the first aim of the present work was to compare our theoretical results with the latest experimental data from the cleo collaboration for the branching ratios @xmath213 and @xmath212 .",
    "our next aim was to study direct cp violation for the decay @xmath226 , with the inclusion of @xmath26 mixing .",
    "the advantage of @xmath26 mixing is that the strong phase difference is large and rapidly varying near the @xmath7 resonance . as a result",
    "the cp violating asymmetry , @xmath4 , has a maximum , @xmath159 , when the invariant mass of the @xmath6 pair is in the vicinity of the @xmath7 resonance and @xmath227 at this point .    in the calculation of cp violating asymmetry parameters , we need the wilson coefficients for the tree and penguin operators at the scale @xmath228 .",
    "we worked with the renormalization scheme independent wilson coefficients .",
    "one of the major uncertainties is that the hadronic matrix elements for both tree and penguin operators involve nonperturbative qcd .",
    "we have worked in the factorization approximation , with @xmath3 treated as an effective parameter .",
    "although one must have some doubts about factorization , it has been pointed out that it may be quite reliable in energetic weak decays  @xcite .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the cp violating asymmetry , @xmath4 , is very sensitive to the ckm matrix elements and the magnitude of the form factors , and we have determined a range for the maximum asymmetry , @xmath159 , as a function of the parameter @xmath3 , the limits of ckm matrix elements and the choice of @xmath160 . from all the models investigated , we found that cp violating asymmetry , @xmath159 , varies from @xmath162 to @xmath163 .",
    "we stressed that the ratio between the asymmetries associated with the limiting values of ckm matrix elements would be mainly determined by @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we also stressed that without @xmath26 mixing , we can not have a large cp violating asymmetry , a , since @xmath4 is proportional to both @xmath8 and @xmath76 .",
    "even though @xmath8 is large around @xmath189 , @xmath76 is very small . as a result",
    ", we find a very small value for the cp violation in the decay @xmath0 ( of the order of a few percent ) without mixing .",
    "once mixing is included , the sign of @xmath79 is positive for @xmath229 . indeed , at the @xmath6 invariant mass where the asymmetry , @xmath4 , is maximum , @xmath227 , independent of the parameters used .",
    "thus , by measuring @xmath4 , we can erase the phase uncertainty mod(@xmath132 ) in the determination of the ckm angle @xmath38 which arises from the conventional determination of @xmath230 .",
    "the theoretical results for the branching ratios for @xmath213 and @xmath212 , were compared with the experimental data from the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "these calculations show that it is possible to have theoretical results consistent with the experimental data without needing to invoke contributions from other resonances  @xcite .",
    "these data helped us to constrain the magnitude of the various form factors needed in the theoretical calculations of b decays .",
    "we determined a range of value of @xmath3 , @xmath220 , inside of which the experimental data and the theoretical calculations are consistent for models 2 and 4 .",
    "we will need more accurate data in the future to further decrease the uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "if we can use both the cp violating asymmetry and the branching ratios , with smaller uncertainties , we expect to be able to determine the ckm matrix elements more precisely . at the very least",
    ", it appears that one will be able to unambiguouly determine the sign of @xmath75 and hence , remove the well known discrete uncertainties in @xmath38 associated with the fact that indirect cp violation determines only @xmath188 .",
    "we expect that our predictions should provide useful guidance for future investigations and urge our experimental collegues to plan seriously to measure the rather dramatic direct cp violation predicted here .",
