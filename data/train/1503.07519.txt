    "the vista variables in the va lctea ( vvv ) variability campaign started in 2010 .",
    "thanks to the vista infrared camera ( vircam , @xcite ) , mounted at the 4.1 m telescope vista ( visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ) , this ongoing survey is mapping the galactic bulge and disk to create a 3-d map of the milky way @xcite . as for many long - term variability surveys , the observing strategy is mainly focused on covering a portion of the sky as large as possible in a single night , scanning the full field of view many times every few days . to this aim , the exposure time of each image has to be short enough in order to achieve the survey specifications . in the vvv survey ,",
    "the typical exposure time for @xmath1-filter images is about 4s , e.g. , a factor 7 smaller than the 30-s threshold set by @xcite and @xcite as the minimum exposure time required to average out the large - scale semi - periodic and correlated atmospheric noise that harms ground - based astrometry . in spite of this",
    ", we chose to exploit the astrometric capabilities of this survey that will release to the community a data set with more than one hundred epochs over six years .    in this paper , we present our reduction pipeline for the detectors and the geometric - distortion correction . as an example , we also show a few applications made possible by the astrometric accuracy reached by the vvv data set so far .

    "vircam is a mosaic of 4@xmath34 detectors mounted at the focus of the vista 4.1 m telescope .",
    "each detector is a raytheon virgo 2048@xmath32048-pixel array and covers @xmath12694@xmath3694 arcsec@xmath13 on the sky .",
    "the average pixel scale is @xmath14 pixel@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the gaps between the detectors are quite large and correspond to 42.5% and 90% of the detector size along the @xmath15 and @xmath16 direction , respectively .",
    "dithered observations are recommended to self - calibrate the geometric distortion of a detector ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the standard dither pattern adopted by vvv is not adequate for this purpose . for this reason , a calibration program ( program i d : 488.l-0500(a ) , pi : bellini )",
    "was approved in 2012 .",
    "the calibration field is centered on globular cluster ngc  5139 ( @xmath17cen ) .",
    "this field was chosen due to its star density over more than one square degree .",
    "the field was observed in the @xmath5 filter in two runs of 25 images each ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) , both organized in an array of 5@xmath35 pointings , but with a different dither spacing ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "large dithers were taken to cover the gap between the 16 chips and to allow us to construct a single reference system for all observations .",
    "the small dither pattern was obtained to allow independent modeling of the residuals of the geometric distortion for each chip .",
    "-filter data .",
    "large- and small - dither images are organized in two 5@xmath35 arrays .",
    "the pointings of the large - dither images are taken to cover the gap between the 16 detectors .",
    "the total field of view covered by our observations is about @xmath18@xmath3@xmath19 on sky .",
    "the two zoomed - in panels show the dither spacing for large ( azure panel ) and small ( red panel ) dither pattern . ]",
    "we developed a reduction package that makes use of the same tools described in @xcite for the hawk - i detector .",
    "here , we briefly describe the software , and focus on the few differences between the two works .",
    "+ one peculiarity of vircam is the striped pattern that affects all the images , both calibration and scientific .",
    "these stripes are generated by the irace electronics @xcite and change from one exposure to the next . to correct them",
    ", we made a fortran routine based on the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu ) pipeline correction , that resembles the correction applied by @xcite for the wfpc2@_hst _ background streaks .",
    "we computed in each image the clipped - median value of the counts in each row , then we took the median of these values and subtracted it from the clipped - median value of each row .",
    "these differences represent the corrections to be applied to each row .",
    "we did not include bad / warm / hot pixels while computing the median values .    using archival flat - field images we were not able to completely correct for the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variation of the detectors , in particular for chip [ 16 ] where the very high quantum - efficiency variation on short timescales sometimes makes it impossible to properly apply the flat - field correction .",
    "so , we constructed master flat - field frames using the scientific images themselves , masking all bad / warm / hot pixels and those in close proximity of any significant source ( stars and galaxies ) and considered these purged images as on - sky flat - field images .",
    "first , we applied dark and flat - field corrections to all images .",
    "then , for each chip we computed the median sky value in a 5@xmath35 grid and subtracted it according to the table .",
    "then we made a 5@xmath35 grid of fully - empirical psf models for each detector of each exposure , following the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "unlike the procedure given in the original and programs , the finding criteria ( minimum flux and minimum separation from brighter stars ) to choose the stars that would be used to model the psf are applied locally and are different in each cell of the grid .",
    "this way , we are able to find the most suitable combination of these criteria in each of the 5@xmath35 regions of the chip ( e.g. , if the cluster center is located in a corner of a chip , the minimum separation from the brighter stars in that corner is usually lower than in the opposite corner where the crowding is lower ) . with an array of psf models , we are able to measure positions and fluxes for all sources on an image . the final catalogs ( one for each chip ) contain positions , instrumental magnitudes , where @xmath20 is the sum of the total counts under the fitted psf . ] , and another quantity called quality - of - psf - fit ( ) which represents the absolute fractional error in the psf - model fit to the star @xcite .",
    "the lower the , the better is the psf fit .",
    "the parameter is a useful quantity to discriminate among well - measured and poorly - measured stars . typically , in @xmath17  cen catalogs we considered bright , unsaturated stars with a @xmath210.05 to be well - measured stars .",
    "these selections allow us to always have at disposal over 100 stars per chip , with an average value of 350 well - measured stars for a corner chip and 1000 stars for a centermost chip .",
    "in the large field of view ( fov ) of vircam , the tangential - plane projection effects are not negligible ( at one degree from the tangent point this corresponds to more than 0.18 arcsec , @xmath120.5 vircam pixel ) .",
    "this means the farther from the center , the larger is the difference between the true position and the projected position of a star .",
    "we chose to perform an auto - calibration . by using as a reference system 2mass @xcite or ucac4 @xcite , which are among the most accurate absolute systems",
    ", we would have unavoidably ended up limited by their accuracy ( of the order of 0.2 - 0.3 arcsec for 2mass ) . not to mention the non - negligible contribution from the stellar motion between the reference system and our exposures .",
    "furthermore , as stated in @xcite , it is difficult to find a distortion - free reference frame with an homogeneous stellar density and luminosity . therefore we adopted the auto - calibration solution .",
    "the basis of the auto - calibration is to observe the same star in as many different locations on the detector as possible and to compute its average position once it is transformed onto a common reference frame .",
    "thanks to the large number and varied spacing of our dither pattern , a given star will be observed in several different locations in the fov and , as such , the systematic errors in its mean position should average out .",
    "this way , the average positions of the stars should provide a reasonable approximation of their true positions in a distortion - free frame ( the master frame ) .",
    "we built the master frame by cross - identifying the stars in each single - detector catalog of each exposure .",
    "we used conformal transformations ( four - parameter linear transformations : rigid shifts in the two coordinates , one rotation , and one change of scale ) to bring the stellar positions measured in each image into the reference system of the master frame . in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the effects of the projection on the master frame .",
    "the positional residuals along the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes show several bumps where two different chips overlap .",
    "when we first examined plots like these , it was clear that the bumps at the boundaries of the chips could be due either to internal distortions within each chip or to errors in placing the chips properly with respect to each other . to ensure that the distortion within each chip was properly accounted for , we independently solve for the geometric distortion of each chip , as done in @xcite .",
    "for this specific purpose , we only used the small - dither images where the gaps between the chips are not covered ( no detector overlaps with any other detector ) .",
    "the accuracy of the single - chip distortion solution was at the 0.02-pixel level ( @xmath127 mas ) .",
    "as an example , in the middle - left panels of fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the residuals after we applied the single - chip correction to the catalogs and constructed a small - dither - based master frame using only chip # 10 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the small dithers do not allow us to put all the 16 chips in the same reference system since the gaps are so large that the chips do not overlap each other .",
    "for this reason we selected one random chip ( chip # 10 ) to show that our single - chip distortion solution was good as we wrote above .",
    "then , we applied our single - chip correction to all catalogs and used four - parameter linear transformations to create a new master frame based on large - dither images .",
    "again , the positional - residual bumps were still visible ( middle - right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , these trends in the positional residuals are ascribable to projection effects , which have to be taken into account while cross - identifying the catalogs .",
    "we chose to define a meta reference system in which to properly project all single - chip catalogs and , at the same time , solve for most of the geometric distortion that affects this detector .",
    "we proceeded as follows .",
    "we used the 2mass catalog as our initial reference frame .",
    "we projected the 2mass catalog onto a tangent plane centered on @xmath17cen and followed the prescriptions given in @xcite to convert r.a . and",
    "dec . positions into pixel - based coordinates .",
    "this is an important step because we imposed the master - frame scale to be exactly equal to 0.339 arcsec pixel@xmath0 for all chips .",
    "this value is the average pixel scale declared by @xcite .",
    "initially , we cross - identified all stars of each single - chip raw frames with the 2mass catalog by using six - parameter linear transformations ( which also include the deviation from orthogonality and the change of relative scale between the two axes ) . then , we located the center of each chip ( @xmath22,@xmath23)@xmath24(1024,1024 ) on the 2mass - based reference system . without properly taking into account for the projection effects , the chip - center positions on the 2mass reference frame depend on their distances from the tangent point ( @xmath17cen center ) and on the geometric distortion .",
    "to get rid of the first dependency and find the best position of the chip centers , we iteratively de - projected the 2mass catalog onto the celestial sphere , and then projected it again using as the tangent point the current chip - center position on the 2mass reference system , in order to compute new , improved transformations . for each chip of each exposure / image we iterated the whole process five times ( after the fifth iteration the adjustments were negligible ) .",
    "once the chip centers in the 2mass reference frame converged to fixed positions , in order to build the meta - reference system , we had to impose additional constraints .",
    "first , the meta center was defined as the average position of the four centermost chips .",
    "the second constraint we imposed is that the @xmath16 and @xmath15 axes of our meta - frame system had to be oriented up and to the right , respectively .",
    "for each of the four centermost chips , we computed the angle between the expected meta - frame @xmath15 axis and the segment that connects the center of the meta frame to the chip center .",
    "then we rotated all chips by the average of the four angles .    for each image we de - projected the 2mass frame onto the celestial sphere and projected it back on a tangent plane , but this time using as tangent point the meta center computed as described above .",
    "then , we rotated and shifted these 2mass - based positions according to the other constraint .",
    "the final products of this effort are 2mass - based positions projected on the meta - frame center of each image , rotated and shifted to have the meta center in ( @xmath22,@xmath23)@xmath24(0,0 ) .",
    "these positions represent the best approximation of the expected distortion - free meta positions .    for each star in common between our catalogs and the 2mass - based catalog , we have a pair of positional residuals that correspond to the difference between the raw - chip positions and the expected meta - frame positions ( given by the stellar positions on the modified 2mass reference frame ) .",
    "we used both saturated and unsaturated stars with magnitude @xmath5@xmath21 - 12 and @xmath210.2 .",
    "since 2mass is a shallow survey , we had to use saturated ( @xmath5@xmath25@xmath2613.4 ) stars in order to have an adequate sample size .",
    "we divided each chip into a 3@xmath33-grid elements and , in each such element , we defined the grid - point value as the average value of the residuals within .",
    "the cells have different sizes , with those close to the edges ( for example 512@xmath3512 pixels on the corners ) smaller than the central one ( 1024@xmath31024 pixels ) , in order to better model the distortion close to the edges . as described in @xcite , for those cells adjoining the detector edges we shifted the grid points to the edge .",
    "we built a look - up table of correction for any location of the chip , using a bi - quadratic interpolation among the surrounding four grid points . to avoid extrapolation ,",
    "our grid points extended to the corners , but this meant that we needed several iterations ( each time applying 90% of the suggested correction to the raw positions and computing new residuals ) before convergence could be achieved . + after this first part of the correction , we have star positions transformed into a meta reference frame and corrected for geometric distortion .",
    "all the stellar positions collected in one meta catalog are those of the stars imaged in one exposure . therefore , accordingly to the table  [",
    "tab : obs ] , we have 50 meta catalogs at our disposal ( 25 of which are based on large - dither exposures , while the other 25 are based on the small - dither exposures ) . the astrometric accuracy achieved is about 0.20.3 pixel , similar to that of 2mass .",
    "the astrometric quality of our measurements should be ten times better than this , so to further improve our result , we applied an additional table - of - residuals correction to each chip by comparing the positions of the stars as measured in different meta catalogs , thus enabling a precision of @xmath120.03 pixel per comparison , as follows . for each pair of meta catalogs ( hereafter catalogs # 1 and # 2 ) ,",
    "we cross - identified all stars in common by using six - parameter linear transformations .",
    "we found the meta center of catalog # 1 into the reference system of catalog # 2 and projected the stellar positions measured in catalog # 2 into the tangent plane centered at the center of catalog # 1 .",
    "then we computed the positional residuals as the difference between the stellar positions in the meta # 1 reference system and the positions in the meta # 2 reference system , once projected and transformed into the meta # 1 reference system .",
    "for those meta catalogs obtained from the large - dither images , we compared each of them to the other 49 catalogs , while small - dither catalogs were only compared to the large - dither ones . when we computed the distortion correction for each chip individually , we used only small - dither images .",
    "we then applied this correction to large - dither images and looked at the residuals computed by comparing our stellar positions with those of 2mass .",
    "we noticed that the non - linear terms of the distortion over a very large scale were not completely accounted for .",
    "therefore , we chose to compute the positional residuals by comparing only images far enough on the sky from each other .",
    "for each chip , we collected all these residuals together and divided them into an array of 11@xmath311 square elements .",
    "we assigned to each array element the median value of the residuals within .",
    "for any location on the chip , the correction is computed as the bi - linear interpolation between the surroundings four grid points .",
    "we iterated five times , computing new residuals and adding the new correction to the previous one .    in summary ,",
    "the distortion solution of each chip consists of two parts : a 3@xmath33 look - up table of residuals ( that is used to compute the correction at any inter - chip location via a bi - quadratic interpolation between the surrounding four grid points ) , and an additional fine - tuning 11@xmath311 look - up table of residuals ( this time using a bi - linear interpolation to compute the correction ) .",
    "the final stellar positions are distortion corrected and projected with respect to the center of the meta catalog .",
    "therefore , each meta catalog is projected into a different tangent plane .",
    "it is important to transform all the catalogs into the same tangent plane during the construction of the master frame . in the rightmost panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the result of our efforts .",
    "we applied our distortion correction to the stars in each meta catalog .",
    "we used six - parameter linear transformations to bring these corrected positions on the master - frame reference system using the same tangent plane for each catalog . this way , the @xmath27(radial residuals)(radial residuals )",
    "is defined as : @xmath28 where ( @xmath29 ) is the position of the @xmath30-th star of the @xmath31-th image , distortion corrected and transformed into the master - frame reference system , @xmath32 is the the transformation of the @xmath31-th image into the master frame , and ( @xmath33 ) is the distortion - free ( master - frame ) position of the @xmath30-th star . ]",

    "we also analyzed the possible impact of differential - chromatic - refraction effects on our pms ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we selected two samples of ngc  6656 stars with a @xmath1 magnitude between 13.5 and 15 , one on the horizontal branch ( blue stars ) and the other on the red giant branch ( red stars ) . even if the mean motion of both samples is the same within the error bars , we chose to remove the small contribution of this effect ( clearly visible in the @xmath40 direction ) .",
    "all pms in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] have been corrected accordingly .",
    "+ to evaluate our pm precision we proceeded as follow . by construction ,",
    "our pms are relative to the cluster mean motion . as such ,",
    "the mean location of cluster members on the vpd is ( 0,0 ) , and the observed dispersion of cluster members should in principle reflect the stellar internal - motion dispersion plus our measurement errors .",
    "the internal dispersion of ngc  6656 is about 0.5 mas yr@xmath0 ( assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc and a central velocity dispersion of 7.8 km s@xmath0 , @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "the 1-d dispersion ( defined as the 68.27@xmath42 percentile of the distribution around the median ) of bright , unsaturated ( 13@xmath39@xmath1@xmath3914 ) cluster stars in the vpd is of about 1.5 mas yr@xmath0 . by subtracting in quadrature the internal dispersion of 0.5 mas yr@xmath0",
    ", we end up with an external estimate of our pm precision , which is of about 1.4 mas yr@xmath0 . +",
    "to further test of our astrometric accuracy we measured the relative difference between the bulge and the disk bulk motion within the same selected vvv field of ngc  6656 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . to this aim , we selected two samples of stars , one from the disk main sequence and one from the bulge red giant branch .",
    "we considered only disk ( bulge ) stars that in the @xmath1 vs. ( @xmath5@xmath26@xmath1 ) cmd are bluer ( redder ) than the respective fiducial line of the sequence .",
    "furthermore , we considered only those stars with pms larger than 5 mas yr@xmath0 with respect to the bulk motion of the cluster .",
    "we fit a single gaussian to the histograms of the bulge and disk pms along each direction , and found a relative displacement of ( @xmath49,@xmath50)@xmath24(@xmath262.13@xmath510.22,@xmath263.58@xmath510.24 ) mas yr@xmath0 .",
    "the absolute difference between bulge and disk bulk motions is therefore 4.18@xmath510.32 mas yr@xmath0 .    to test this result , we measured the relative displacement between the bulge and the disk components using the motion of the same test stars as measured in the ucac4 and the ppmxl ( @xcite ) catalogs .",
    "we found a relative displacement of 3.79@xmath510.98 mas yr@xmath0 using ucac4 and 2.93@xmath511.3 mas yr@xmath0 using ppmxl , which are in agreement with our estimate within the error bars , though our estimate has a smaller uncertainty .",
    "we also compared our measured difference between bulge and disk motion with that predicted by the besanon models ( @xcite ) .",
    "we simulated both populations in the same field covered by our application .",
    "we adopted an exponential trend for photometric and pm errors as function of the magnitude to create a model as close as possible to our data .",
    "the major challenge was to take into account for the correct absorption toward the galactic plane .",
    "we used the bulge extinction and metallicity ( beam , see @xcite ) calculator to compute the average extinction in our field .",
    "this value , divided by ngc  6656 distance , gives us the diffuse absorption of 0.15 mag kpc@xmath0 .",
    "the difference between bulge and disk motion obtained this way is 1.38@xmath510.12 mas yr@xmath0 .",
    "this value is not consistent with our measurements .",
    "we performed different simulations varying the absorption coefficients to understand if the absorption law could somehow change the simulated kinematics , but we found the results were about the same .",
    "we attribute this significant difference to the difficulty of the besanon model in simulating the reddening , galaxy stellar densities and kinematics toward the galactic plane where the extinction is high .",
    "+      the vista variables in the va lctea will be completed in 2016 @xcite , and the time baseline provided by the uniform vvv data will be about six years . as an example , we combined the vvv images of ngc  6656 and the hawk - i data previously used by @xcite .",
    "since the hawk - i images were taken in 2007 , we used only the vvv archival images between 2010 and 2013 in order to have approximately the 6 years of time baseline .",
    "we computed the pms as described in the previous section and in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the resulting cmds and vpds .",
    "as expected , with a larger time baseline we are able to completely separate cluster and field stars .",
    "this example shows again the great astrometric potential of the full - baseline vvv data .",
    "older epochs ( both optical and near - infrared data ) are available in the archives , and the proper motions will be an invaluable resource to distinguish the different stellar populations in the galaxy .     vs. ( @xmath5@xmath26@xmath1 ) color - magnitude diagrams of the stars in common between the hawk - i and vvv fields .",
    "we plot only well - measured - pm stars . on the left panels we plot the entire sample , while in the center and right panels we plot only cluster members and field stars respectively .",
    "we considered ngc  6656 stars those stars with a proper motion within 4 mas yr@xmath0 around the cluster mean motion ( red circle centered in ( 0,0 ) in the middle vpd ) ; while the stars enclosed in the ellipse centered in ( @xmath2611.5,1.2 ) mas yr@xmath0 with major and minor axes of 12 and 9 mas yr@xmath0 are probable field stars . ]",
    "in this paper we present our reduction pipeline for the vircam detector and the geometric distortion solution based on the @xmath5 filter .",
    "thanks to our distortion correction and to the adopted dithered observing strategy , we are able to reach a positional residual of @xmath128 mas in each coordinate in each exposure across the entire fov of vircam . note that we are talking about relative astrometry .",
    "our absolute astrometry is not as good as the relative one because the linear terms are constrained only with 2mass .",
    "we release a ` fortran ` routine to correct the geometric distortion . for a given position in a single - chip raw frame ( @xmath52,@xmath35 ) and the chip number , the code produces ( @xmath53,@xmath37 ) coordinates in the meta - frame reference system .",
    "the code is available at our group s web page .",
    "the use of this distortion solution is encouraged regardless of the specific method adopted to measure stellar positions .",
    "each meta catalog is projected into a plane tangential to its center .",
    "this offers the best single - catalog , distortion - free positions .",
    "please note that , in order to construct a common reference frame , all meta catalogs should be instead projected into the same tangent plane ( see sect .",
    "[ gdc ] ) .    as a test bed of the astrometric accuracy reached by our geometric - distortion correction",
    ", we applied our reduction pipeline to a set of vvv archival images .",
    "we chose a field centered on the globular cluster ngc  6656 and we computed the relative proper motion of the ngc  6656 and galactic bulge and disk stars , as well as the individual motion of each star in the field .",
    "we noticed that our astrometric accuracy is worse ( @xmath120.08 pixel ) using vvv data .",
    "our correction is an average solution and the distortion is not entirely stable .",
    "however , by starting with a good average solution , local transformations ( used to compute the proper motions ) can be used to efficiently achieve optimal precision even with this type of data .",
    "we demonstrate that we are able to separate cluster and background / foreground field stars with a time baseline of only four years .",
    "the cluster stars , in the cleaned cmd , can be used for the study of the stellar populations of ngc  6656 .",
    "we also showed that the field stars , in the direction of ngc  6656 , are of great use , e.g. , to separate ( and study ) the proper motions of the galactic disk and bulge components .",
    "we demonstrated that our results are consistent with what can be obtained using ucac4 and ppmxl catalogs , though our measurements have a much smaller error .",
    "galactic models fail to reproduce the observations , likely because of the difficulties to reproduce the reddening and kinematics towards the galactic bulge .    with the images analyzed in this paper and a time baseline of about four years",
    ", we obtained a typical astrometric precision of 1.4 mas yr@xmath0 for bright , unsaturated well - measured stars .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath54@xmath1221 km s@xmath0 at the distance of ngc  6656 ( 3.2 kpc from @xcite , 2010 edition ) , or @xmath1253 km s@xmath0 at 8 kpc ( a reference distance for the bulge ) . at the end of the vvv survey",
    ", the total time baseline will be of about six years , thus further increasing the final achievable pm accuracy .",
    "the use of older , archive , optical and near - infrared data will further enhance the proper - motion capability of the vvv survey .",
    "the astrometric capability of this survey is complementary to gaia , in particular in the most crowded and heavily - absorbed regions not reachable by gaia , and to study objects below its magnitude limit ( @xmath55@xmath1220 ) .",
