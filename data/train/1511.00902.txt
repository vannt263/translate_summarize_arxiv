    "<S> in this short note , we come back to the recent proposal put forward by kharzeev and levin @xcite , in which they phenomenologically couple the non - perturbative veneziano ghost to the perturbative gluon , leading to a modified gluon propagator ( the `` glost '' ) of the gribov type , with complex poles . as such , a possible link was made between the qcd topological @xmath0-vacuum ( veneziano ghost ) and color confinement ( no physically observable gluons ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some subtleties concerning gauge ( brst ) invariance of this proposal , related to the choice of feynman gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore provide an example in the landau gauge of a similar phenomenological vertex that also describes the necessary veneziano ghost but does not affect the landau gauge gluon propagator .    in the recent letter @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> see also @xcite , the issue of the veneziano ghost @xcite was revisited . in the absence of massless quarks , </S>",
    "<S> the qcd action can explicitly depend on an extra parameter , the @xmath0-angle , closely related to the non - trivial topological nature of the qcd vacuum ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> instanton dynamics describing the tunneling between different states with different winding number , @xcite ) .    for the sake of presentation </S>",
    "<S> , we will mostly follow the notations of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental ingredient in the whole discussion is the topological susceptibility @xmath1 , defined in the _ pure _ yang - mills case as the zero momentum correlator @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a pseudoscalar quantity , given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 the dual field strength . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to @xcite for more details . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of @xmath1 received numerous lattice confirmations , see e.g.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting part is that the gauge invariant quantity @xmath6 can be written as a total derivative of a gauge variant pseudovector @xmath7 , @xmath8 a non - vanishing @xmath9 correlator at zero momentum , that is , a non - vanishing topological susceptibility , is thus only possible if there is a massless pole in the @xmath10 correlator given that @xmath11 is a total derivative . </S>",
    "<S> such a pseudovector pole was introduced first by veneziano @xcite , inspired by witten @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were then able to connect the topological susceptibility to the mass of the @xmath12 particle . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , veneziano proposed @xmath13 the negative sign of residue of the massless pole indicates the new `` particle '' is indeed a ghost , see also @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> kharzeev and levin then recognized that the current correlator can be interpreted as being sourced by an effective interaction between the glue and the veneziano ghost . </S>",
    "<S> they postulated such a vertex , and then solved the dyson - schwinger equation using solely this coupling , leading to a dynamically corrected gluon propagator ( the `` glost '' ) given by @xmath14 in the following we will first show that this result necessarily breaks the perturbative brst symmetry of the underlying theory .    </S>",
    "<S> they relied on the feynman gauge to facilitate computations . </S>",
    "<S> let us first look again at the faddeev - popov action in a general linear covariant gauge , written as @xmath15 with covariant derivative @xmath16 the auxiliary field @xmath17 enforces the linear covariant gauge , with @xmath18 corresponding to the feynman gauge .    </S>",
    "<S> we recall here that the local gauge invariance gets replaced , after gauge fixing , by the brst invariance @xcite , a crucial concept to treat gauge theories at the quantum level , used in proofs of perturbative unitarity , renormalizability or quantum gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the brst variation reads @xmath19 hence @xmath20 the tree level gluon propagator in momentum ( fourier ) space is easily found , viz .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 the longitudinal part is thus given by @xmath22 and this is in fact an exact result , as a result of brst symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> one way to appreciate this would be to recall that the gluon self - energy corrections are transverse due to brst invariance , so the longitudinal sector of its inverse ( viz .  </S>",
    "<S> the gluon propagator ) can not receive any corrections and thus it stays bare . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will discuss later , sometimes one has to be careful when using the gluon self - energy .    </S>",
    "<S> another explicit way to understand , not making using of the gluon self - energy but still making use of brst invariance , goes as follows : we can always exactly compute the @xmath23-propagator from the action ; with @xmath24 representing any other field present in the action and adding to the action the term @xmath25 , with @xmath26 an external current ; @xmath27e^{-s}\\right\\vert_{j=0}\\,.\\ ] ] we can integrate exactly over the @xmath23-field , giving @xmath28e^{-s}= \\int [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\varphi]e^{-\\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4x\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\alpha } ( { \\partial}a)^2+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}j{\\partial}a+\\frac{j^2}{2\\alpha}+\\text{rest}\\right)}\\,.\\ ] ] using , this leads to the exact identification @xmath29 since the l.h.s .  </S>",
    "<S> must be zero assuming brst invariance ( @xmath30 ) , so must be the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> as we only relied on the definition of the linear covariant gauge , next to brst invariance , we can safely state that , according to , the gluon propagator in that gauge must be of the form @xmath31 in fourier space , where all non - trivial ( non-)perturbative information is collected in the form factor @xmath32 coupled to the transverse projector @xmath33 .    returning to the glost , it is immediately clear , given the incompatibility of the general form and the glost - result , that the brst symmetry must be violated , given that the feynman gauge definition / choice was not explicitly violated .    next , let us have a closer look on the alluded connection with the gribov gauge fixing ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> this was first considered by gribov in the seminal work @xcite at leading order , later on generalized to all orders by zwanziger , see @xcite and the recent review @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these works were focused on either the landau gauge ( @xmath34 limit of the linear covariant gauge , corresponding to @xmath35 ) or the coulomb gauge , although it was shown later on by singer that the gribov problem is of a quite generic nature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only more recently , the gribov issue was considered for the linear covariant gauge and studied explicitly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us provide a sketchy overview of the gribov problem . assuming a linear gauge fixing of the type @xmath36 then the faddeev - popov construction implicitly relies on the fact that each gauge orbit only intersects once with the hypersurface defined by . </S>",
    "<S> though , gribov showed this to be wrong at least for @xmath37 ( landau gauge ) . assuming an infinitesimally gauge equivalent configuration @xmath38 then @xmath39 can fulfill the same gauge condition iff @xmath40 that is , there are gauge copies if the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath41 , has non - trivial zero modes . in the case of the landau gauge , this operator is hermitian , so its eigenvalues are real . </S>",
    "<S> gribov and zwanziger therefore suggested to restrict the path integration to a subset of gauge configurations , namely those for which the faddeev - popov operator is positive . </S>",
    "<S> they managed to implement this restriction explicitly into the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to the introduction of a dynamical mass scale @xmath42 into the theory obeying a self - consistent gap equation , and which affects the gluon propagator . at leading order </S>",
    "<S> , one finds @xcite @xmath43 the presence of the complex conjugate poles in is why gribov propagators are frequently used in describing confined degrees of freedom , since these can not have a physical particle ( klln - lehmann ) interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> the glost propagator thus appears of the gribov type , , if we identify the gribov mass scale @xmath42 with the topological susceptibility @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the derivation of the gribov propagator is _ specific _ for the landau gauge , so it does not apply to the feynman gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization of the gribov - zwanziger construction to the linear covariant gauges was discussed in @xcite , leading to a propagator @xmath44 as such , the identification of the feynman gauge glost propagator as the one capable of dynamically curing the gribov ambiguity based on the topological properties of the qcd vacuum ( non - zero @xmath1 ) does not necessarily appear to be well founded . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the ( partial ) resolution of the gauge fixing ambiguity by restricting the integration region of the gauge fields  la gribov - zwanziger does lead to a ( soft ) breaking of the `` standard '' brst symmetry generated by , see for instance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though , a non - perturbative brst symmetry can be introduced , depending on the gribov mass @xmath42 , which allows , for example , to still prove the non - renormalization of the longitudinal gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> next to analytical arguments @xcite , this has also been explicitly observed in lattice simulations @xcite , which in principle encompass the topological raison dtre of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that , when using the gribov - zwanziger formalism , additional fields are required to maintain locality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these extra fields enter the brst transformation and mix up with e.g.  the gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> as such , it makes no longer sense to work with only the gluon self energy , since it will be part of a 1pi matrix that defines , after inversion , the ( connected ) propagator matrix . for an explicit example , see @xcite .    as the gribov issue has been studied to more extent in the landau gauge , we should not refrain from carrying out a similar exercise as @xcite in this particular gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we first notice that is not the unique sensible way to introduce the veneziano ghost . </S>",
    "<S> the most important ingredient is to have the zero mass pole , so @xmath45 will equally well do the job ( see also @xcite ) , i.e.  without changing the gauge invariant @xmath9-correlator . </S>",
    "<S> any suitably chosen linear combination of and is also possible . </S>",
    "<S> adding a term transversal in @xmath46 will not affect @xmath9 either . </S>",
    "<S> we will now benefit from these observations . following @xcite , from we </S>",
    "<S> may define an effective infrared veneziano ghost - gluon - gluon vertex @xmath47 , @xmath48 where we assumed the landau gauge condition . </S>",
    "<S> from the landau gauge defining ward identity @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the 1pi generating functional , it can be easily shown that the landau gauge gluon propagator is necessarily transverse , thus proportional to the already defined projector @xmath51 .    a ( possible ) solution to </S>",
    "<S> is provided by @xmath52 where we omitted some numerical prefactors irrelevant for further purposes . </S>",
    "<S> the indices @xmath53 , resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 refer to the veneziano ghost , resp .  </S>",
    "<S> gluons .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming the infrared physics is dominated by the glost , we can compute the one loop gluon self energy @xmath55 using the vertex @xmath56 . the diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 leads to @xmath57 where we used for the internal veneziano ghost a propagator of the form @xmath58 , consistent with our earlier choice .    </S>",
    "<S> [ selfenergy ]     as in @xcite , we can approximate the integral by assuming @xmath59 as we are considering non - perturbative effects in the very deep infrared . </S>",
    "<S> because of our choice of vertex , we would find , for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and a fortiori , we would thus have @xmath61 i.e.  the gluon self energy becomes longitudinal in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it is then immediate that the landau gauge glost propagator will coincide with the perturbative gluon one , since the transverse projector , that is by definition present in the propagator , will always project to zero the self - energy correction .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that we are not proclaiming that the vertex defined via - is the correct one in the landau gauge , as other possibilities exist , as long as the gauge invariant correlation function @xmath9 is correctly reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> we merely wanted to illustrate that depending on the vertex choice , quite some different glost propagator dynamics could emerge . </S>",
    "<S> however , to find out which vertex is effectively realized per gauge is open for future debate . </S>",
    "<S> another strong constraint , next to consistency with @xmath9 , is that the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator in the class of linear covariant gauges should receive no quantum corrections . in brief , a possible strategy to proceed would be to set @xmath62 with @xmath63 ; and then to propose anstze for the vertex @xmath47 such that can be realized in conjunction with a longitudinal gluon propagator projection that remains @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> at last , it is worth mentioning that the gribov problem has been extensively studied in the coulomb gauge as well , in which case @xcite a gluon propagator @xmath65 was predicted ( up to a projector ) , a form that is indeed pretty consistent with corresponding lattice data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would appear that does not entirely match the coulomb gauge glost propagator used in @xcite to analyze a non - perturbative infrared coupling constant . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a link was also made with brst breaking .    in summary , we have provided some arguments why it appears to be premature to directly link the topological nature of the qcd vacuum to confinement , or more precisely , to link the veneziano ghost to the issue of gribov copies and confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the apparent lack of brst invariance , related to a strong constraint on the longitudinal sector of the gluon / glost propagator that is not fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> as respecting brst invariance is crucial to extract gauge invariant ( or better said , gauge parameter independent ) physical information , one does not have the liberty to tamper too much with effective vertices and/or propagators . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we paid a somewhat closer view at the connection with the gribov gauge fixing ambiguity , reporting some different behaviour here than from the introduced gluon / glost propagator . furthermore , we provided an example of a `` veneziano vertex '' that does not affect the gluon propagator at all , at least in the landau gauge .    </S>",
    "<S> though , further research is definitely needed to provide a firmer answer to the premise of @xcite , and either to confirm or to falsify it . in our opinion , a quite delicate point is the gauge dependent nature of the @xmath66-current and its correlation function . since this is a genuinely non - perturbative correlation function , it would already be most interesting to have specific information about it using e.g.  _ gauge fixed _ lattice simulations or perhaps even via functional methods . that such might become possible in the future </S>",
    "<S> is not unrealistic , given the recent progress in accessing the linear covariant gauges non - perturbatively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this might also put further restrictions on how the effective veneziano ghost - gluon interaction must be modeled . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> lattice landau gauge is well - matured by now , so that might be the first option to explore the veneziano ghost in a fully non - perturbative gauge fixed setting . </S>"
