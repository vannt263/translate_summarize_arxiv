    "the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) and the virgo collaboration operate a network of interferometric gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors with the goal of detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical sources . some of these sources may produce transient `` bursts '' of gw radiation with relatively short duration ( @xmath31 s ) .",
    "plausible burst sources  @xcite include merging compact binary systems consisting of black holes and/or neutron stars  @xcite , core - collapse supernovae  @xcite , neutron star collapse  @xcite , starquakes associated with magnetar flares  @xcite or pulsar glitches  @xcite , cosmic string cusps  @xcite , and other violent events in the universe .    during the most recent data - taking run five",
    "gw detectors were operational .",
    "the three ligo detectors  @xcite started their science run 5 ( s5 ) in november 2005 , and the geo600 detector  @xcite joined the s5 run in january 2006 .",
    "the virgo detector  @xcite began its virgo science run 1 ( vsr1 ) in may 2007 .",
    "all five instruments took data together until the beginning of october 2007 .",
    "an all - sky search for gw burst signals has already been conducted on the first calendar year of the ligo s5 data ( referred to as `` '' ) in a wide frequency band of @xmath4 hz @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report on a search for gw burst signals in the frequency band @xmath5  hz for the rest of the s5/vsr1 run , referred to as `` /vsr1 '' .",
    "it includes data collected by the ligo and virgo detectors , which had comparable sensitivities , and uses three different search algorithms . in comparison with the  analysis ,",
    "the network of ligo and virgo detectors , spread over three sites , provides better sky coverage as well as improved capabilities to reject spurious signals .",
    "/vsr1 is also the first long - term observation with the world - wide network of interferometric detectors .",
    "this is a major step forward with respect to previous observations led by the network of resonant detectors  @xcite , since , as we will show in this paper , the performance is improved by more than one order of magnitude both in the analyzed frequency bandwidth and the level of instrumental noise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : s5detectors ] we describe the lsc and virgo instruments . in section  [ sec : overview ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the search procedure . in section  [ sec : pipeline ] we present the search algorithms .",
    "simulations are described in section  [ sec : simulations ] , and the error analysis in section  [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "the results of the search are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , and astrophysical implications are discussed in section  [ sec : summaries ] .",
    "the appendices provide additional details on data characterization and the analysis pipelines .",
    "ligo consists of three detectors at two observatories in the united states .",
    "each detector is a large michelson - type interferometer with additional mirrors forming fabry - perot cavities in the arms and a power - recycling mirror in the input beam path .",
    "interferometric sensing and feedback is used to `` lock '' the mirror positions and orientations to keep all of the optical cavities on resonance .",
    "a gravitational wave is sensed as a quadrupolar strain , measured interferometrically as an effective difference between the lengths of the two arms .",
    "the ligo hanford observatory , in washington , houses independent detectors with the arm lengths of 4 km and 2 km , called h1 and h2 respectively .",
    "the ligo livingston observatory , in louisiana , has a single detector with 4-km arms , called l1 .",
    "the detector instrumentation and operation are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , and the improvements leading up to the s5 run which are most relevant for gw burst searches have been described in the first - year search  @xcite .    the best achieved sensitivities of the ligo detectors during the second year of s5 , as a function of signal frequency , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shh ] .",
    "the detectors are most sensitive over a band extending from about 40hz to a few khz .",
    "seismic noise dominates at lower frequencies since the effectiveness of the seismic isolation system is a very strong function of frequency . above @xmath6200hz ,",
    "laser shot noise corrected for the fabry - perot cavity response yields an effective strain noise that rises linearly with frequency .",
    "the sensitivity at intermediate frequencies is determined mainly by thermal noise , with contributions from other sources .",
    "the peaks at @xmath6350hz and harmonics are the thermally - excited vibrational modes of the wires from which the large mirrors are suspended .",
    "smaller peaks are due to other mechanical resonances , power line harmonics , and calibration signals .",
    "commissioning periods during the second year of s5 led to incremental improvements in the detector sensitivities .",
    "the most significant of these were in january 2007 , when the seismic isolation systems at both sites were improved to reduce the coupling of microseismic noise to the mirror suspensions , thereby mitigating noise from the nonlinear barkhausen effect  @xcite in the magnets used to control the mirror positions ; and in august 2007 , when the l1 frequency stabilization servo was re - tuned .",
    "overall , the average sensitivities of the h1 and l1 detectors during the second year were about 20% better than the first - year averages , while the h2 detector ( less sensitive to begin with by a factor of @xmath62 ) had about the same average sensitivity in both years .",
    "the operational duty cycles for all three detectors also improved as the run progressed , from ( 72.8% , 76.7% , 61.0% ) averaged over the first year to ( 84.0% , 80.6% , 73.6% ) averaged over the second year for h1 , h2 , and l1 , respectively .      the geo600 detector , located near hannover , germany , also operated during s5 , though with a lower sensitivity than the ligo and virgo detectors .",
    "the geo600 data are not used in the initial search stage of the current study as the modest gains in the sensitivity to gw signals would not offset the increased complexity of the analysis .",
    "the geo600 data are held in reserve , and used to follow up any detection candidates from the ligo - virgo analysis .",
    "geo600 began its participation in s5 on january  21 2006 , acquiring data during nights and weekends .",
    "commissioning work was performed during the daytime , focussing on gaining a better understanding of the detector and improving data quality .",
    "geo switched to full - time data taking from may  1 to october  6 , 2006 , then returned to night - and - weekend mode through the end of the s5 run .",
    "overall geo600 collected about 415 days of science data during s5 , for a duty cycle of 59.7% over the full s5 run .",
    "the virgo detector  @xcite , also called v1 , is an interferometer with 3 km arms located near pisa in italy .",
    "one of the main instrumental differences with respect to ligo is the seismic isolation system based on super - attenuators  @xcite , chains of passive attenuators capable of filtering seismic disturbances in 6 degrees of freedom with sub - hertz corner frequencies . for vsr1 ,",
    "the virgo duty cycle was 81% and the longest continuous period with the mirror positions interferometrically controlled was more than @xmath7 hours .",
    "another benefit from super - attenuators is a significant reduction of the detector noise at very low frequency ( @xmath8  hz ) where virgo surpasses the ligo sensitivity .    above @xmath9  hz",
    ", the spectral sensitivity achieved by virgo during vsr1 is comparable to that of ligo ( see figure  [ fig : shh ] ) . above @xmath10",
    "hz the virgo sensitivity is dominated by shot noise . below @xmath10  hz there is excess noise due to environmental and instrumental noise sources , and below 300  hz these produce burst - like transients .    due to the different orientation of its arms , the antenna pattern ( angular sensitivity ) of virgo is complementary to that of the ligo detectors , with highest response in directions of low ligo sensitivity .",
    "virgo therefore significantly increases the sky coverage of the network .",
    "in addition , simultaneous observations with the three ligo - virgo sites improve rejection of spurious signals and allow reconstruction of the sky position and waveforms of detected gw sources .",
    "the analysis described in this paper uses data from the ligo detectors collected from 14 november 2006 through 1 october 2007 ( ) , and virgo data from vsr1 , which started on 18 may 18 2007 and ended at the same time as s5 .",
    "the procedure used for this /vsr1 search is the same as that used for  @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly review the main stages of the analysis .",
    "the detectors are occasionally affected by instrumental or data acquisition artifacts as well as by periods of degraded sensitivity or an excessive rate of transient noise due to environmental conditions such as bad weather .",
    "low - quality data segments are tagged with data quality flags ( dqfs ) .",
    "these dqfs are divided into three categories depending on their seriousness .",
    "category 1 dqfs are used to define the data segments processed by the analysis algorithms .",
    "category 2 dqfs are unconditional data cuts applied to any events generated by the algorithms .",
    "category 3 dqfs define the clean data set used to calculate upper limits on the gw rates .",
    "we define dqfs for /vsr1 following the approach used for  @xcite .",
    "more details are given in appendix  [ sec : dataquality ] .",
    "after category 2 dqfs have been applied , the total available time during this period is 261.6 days for h1 , 253.4 days for h2 , 233.7 days for l1 and 106.2 days for v1  .      as discussed in section  [ sec : pipeline ] , three independent search algorithms are used to identify possible gw bursts : exponential gaussian correlator ( egc ) , @xmath11-pipeline ( @xmath11 ) , and coherent waveburst ( cwb ) .",
    "we analyze data from time intervals when at least two detectors were operating in coincidence .",
    "altogether , eight networks , or sets of detectors , operating during mutually exclusive time periods are analyzed by at least one algorithm .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] shows the time available for analysis ( `` live time '' ) for the different network configurations after application of category 1 and 2 dqfs .",
    "the actual times searched by each algorithm for each network ( `` observation times '' ) reflect details of the algorithms , such as the smallest analyzable data block , as well as choices about which networks are most suitable for each algorithm .",
    "the three- and two - detector network configurations not shown in table  [ tab : data ] have negligible live time and are not considered in this search .",
    ".[tab : data ] exclusive live time in days for each detector network configuration after category 2 dqfs ( second column ) and the observation time analyzed by each of the search algorithms ( last three columns ) .",
    "the cwb algorithm did not process the l1v1 network because the coherent likelihood regulator used in this analysis was suboptimal for two detectors with very different orientations .",
    "omega used a coherent combination of h1 and h2 as an effective detector and thus analyzed networks either with both or with neither .",
    "egc analyzed only data with three or more interferometers during the part of the run when virgo was operational . [",
