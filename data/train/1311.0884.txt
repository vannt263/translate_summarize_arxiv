    "the thermal wimp paradigm holds that weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp)s can explain the dark matter ( dm ) relic abundance , as measured by cosmic microwave background experiments  @xcite , via thermal freeze - out of annihilation in the early universe .",
    "it is predictive , minimal , and independent of the prior thermal history of the universe .    from the point of view of particle physics",
    ", however , the picture is in a sense _ too _ minimal and predictive , and rules out vast regions of parameter space in well - motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . for most of these notes",
    ", we will be concerned with supersymmetry , and in particular our primary example will be the @xmath0-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we will make no value judgement of the mssm with regard to its other discontents , such as naturalness and its unease with the observed higgs mass .",
    "we will use it merely as an example of the kind of hard constraints that dm physics can put on a particle theory model .",
    "the fact that the mssm generically _ does not _ prefer a thermal wimp is well known .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , typically the lightest neutralino @xmath1 protected by @xmath0-parity , is the canonical choice for the wimp .",
    "however , assuming a thermal history , the wimp gives the observed relic density only in fine - tuned regions of parameter space .",
    "for wino or higgsino dm , thermal history predicts a wimp mass in the region of @xmath2 tev and @xmath3 tev , respectively , due to the fact that these candidates annihilate too efficiently for smaller mass . while there is nothing wrong with having such massive candidates , this takes such candidates out of contention for observation at colliders or dm experiments in the near future . for bino",
    "dm , the problem is that it over - produces dm unless its annihilation cross section is bolstered with coannihilation effects or resonances .",
    "these effects are generally fine - tuned .",
    "another possibility is a well tempered neutralino , which contains just the right relative projections of @xmath1 along bino and wino / higgsino directions , to give the observed relic density .",
    "this option is quite non - generic in parameter space , as may be expected given that a priori the projections can take any value they want .",
    "moreover , some well tempered scenarios are under intense pressure from other sources , such as dm direct detection experiments ( for example , the bino / higgsino candidate , which has a large @xmath4 coupling , and scatters efficiently off nuclei ) .",
    "of course the thermal wimp framework should be patiently probed in all corners of parameter space .",
    "we refer to a selective list of collider studies that have been performed in this regard @xcite .",
    "the high luminosity lhc will certainly shed more light on the viability of thermal dm in the mssm .",
    "given the above , it is important to keep an open mind about conditions of minimality .",
    "there are essentially two departures from the minimal scenario that can be considered : @xmath5 a non - standard cosmological history for dm , such as its origin from the decay of moduli fields in the early universe @xcite or @xmath6 multi - component dm , in which the cosmological history is thermal , but the relic density is satisfied by the lightest neutralino along with one or more additional candidates , motivated by other physics ( not necessarily supersymmetry ) .",
    "both these non - minimal options immediately open up vast swathes of parameter space , because the relic density constraint is effectively loosened . the case for non - thermal cosmological histories",
    "is particularly strong , given this bias .",
    "the reasons are as follows :    @xmath7 non - thermal histories can accommodate both the case of thermally under - producing ( wino - like and higgsino - like ) dm as well as the case of thermally over - producing ( bino - like ) dm . note that multi - component dm fails to accommodate the latter .",
    "this is important , since it is the bino - like lsp that one obtains in large parts of parameter space .",
    "the correct relic density is obtained in this case through what we will call the  branching scenario \" , which works by producing the correct dm number density from a late decaying modulus without relying on further dm annihilation . while this fact has been widely known from the original literature in the subject , we feel that it has been somewhat under - appreciated in model building efforts .",
    "@xmath8 the ubiquity of moduli in string theory , and the various explicit existing models of moduli stabilization , provide a fertile laboratory for exploring the model building challenges of non - thermal histories .",
    "@xmath9 both indirect and direct detection dm experiments are beginning to say interesting things about models of non - thermal dm .",
    "@xmath10 non - thermal baryogenesis can be achieved with @xmath11 couplings of new fields to the mssm , and the baryon - dm coincidence problem can be addressed by branchings from modulus decay .",

    "we give the basics of non - thermal dm with particular emphasis on the options available to obtain the correct relic density . in section [ indircol ] ,",
    "we describe aspects of indirect and direct dm as well as collider experiments that have a bearing on non - thermal scenarios . in section [ challenges ] , we give the basic challenges of these scenarios , and in section [ uvmodels ] , we give some avenues of model building in the modulus sector to address these challenges . in section [ clado ] , we describe how the baryon asymmetry - dm coincidence problem may be addressed in this framework .",
    "in this section , we discuss the two main scenarios for dm from modulus decay : annihilation ( which accommodates candidates like the wino or the higgsino ) and branching ( which accommodates candidates like the bino ) .    we consider a scalar field @xmath12 with mass @xmath13 and decay width _ s = , where @xmath14 is a model dependent constant .    assuming that @xmath12 has acquired a large vacuum expectation value during inflation",

    "while xenon100 data would appear to rule out this result at the present time , xenon10 is not that inconsistent with it @xcite , clearly warranting further probes of this region .    a light dm with cross section in the above range is somewhat challenging for thermal framework .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "if dm scattering off nuclei occurs through the exchange of new heavy coloured states at the tev - scale , then obtaining the desired scattering cross - section for a light dm leads to a small annihilation cross section and hence an over - abundance of relic dm at the current epoch assuming standard cosmological evolution .",
    "this is precisely the kind of situation suited to the branching scenario .    as an explicit example",
    ", we consider the following model for light dm @xcite .",
    "we start with the mssm and introduce new iso - singlet color - triplet superfields @xmath71 and @xmath72 with respective hypercharges @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and a singlet superfield @xmath75 with the following superpotential which is added to the usual mssm superpotential [ superpot ] w_new = _ i x n u^c_i + ^_i j |x",

    "the superpotential coupling @xmath82 yields an effective interaction between @xmath83 and a quark @xmath84 via @xmath56-channel exchange of the fermionic component of @xmath71 .",
    "the amplitude is given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the quark momentum , @xmath87 is the momentum of @xmath83 , and @xmath88 .",

    "we note that this scenario easily evades bounds coming from monojet searches at colliders .",
    "the pair production of fermionic components of @xmath94 superfields , which are @xmath0-parity odd , will produce 4 jets plus missing energy final states at the lhc in this model . in the non - supersymmetric version of the model , where @xmath75 fermion is the dm candidate , the absence of @xmath0-parity fields results in missing energy final states with 2 and 3 jets only , which will allow us to distinguish the two scenarios .",
    "the superpotential coupling @xmath82 also results in annihilation of @xmath83 quanta into a pair of a right - handed quark and left - handed antiquark of the up - type .",

    "therefore thermal freeze - out yields an over - abundance of @xmath83 particles .",
    "this implies that obtaining the correct dm relic density requires a non - thermal scenario which can address thermal over - abundance .",
    "this is precisely the branching scenario .",
    "one can write down operators that can plausibly lead to the branching scenario ( specific uv settings will be discussed in section [ uvmodels ] ) .",
    "the main requirement , as described in section [ rodd ] , is that modulus decay to @xmath0-odd states be suppressed to @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath12 can mainly decay into scalar components of @xmath94 superfields ( denoted by @xmath104 respectively ) , which are @xmath0-parity even fields , through a coupling @xmath105 in the khler potential .",

    "the decays of @xmath12 to @xmath0-parity odd gauginos can be suppressed by suitable geometric criteria e.g. , by constructing the visible sector at a singularity and selecting @xmath12 to be the volume modulus in large volume compactification scenarios @xcite ( we note here that tree level modulus coupling through the gauge kinetic function does _ not _ suppress gaugino production - a fact overlooked in some of the early literature ) .",
    "the decay of @xmath12 to other @xmath0-parity odd mssm fields like squarks and sleptons is suppressed after using the equations of motion . the decay to the gravitino",
    "can also be kinematically suppressed for superheavy ( @xmath106 gev ) gravitinos .",
    "finally , the decay of @xmath12 to @xmath107 is suppressed by preventing the khler potential coupling @xmath108 with symmetries .",
    "observing candidates such as the non - thermal wino or the higgsino at the lhc remains an important complementary objective .",
    "the main challenge to a direct probe of the electroweak sector at the lhc is the small production cross section of neutralinos , charginos , and sleptons compared to the coloured sector .",
    "vector boson fusion ( vbf ) processes , characterized by two jets with large dijet invariant mass in the forward region and in opposite hemispheres , are a promising avenue to search for new physics .",
    "two recent studies have used vbf processes to investigate the chargino / neutralino sector of supersymmetric theories ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "direct production of the lightest neutralino by vbf processes in events with two forward jets and missing transverse energy in the final state was studied at the 14 tev lhc , providing a search strategy also applicable to compressed spectra that can be carried out with an experimentally plausible and bias - free trigger .",
    "a simultaneous fit of the signal rate and missing energy distribution was used to measure the mass and composition of the lightest neutralino as well as the dark matter relic density .",
    "it was shown that wino ( higgsino ) masses can be probed ( at 5@xmath109 ) up to approximately 600 ( 400 ) gev with a luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath102 at lhc14 . in a separate study ,",
    "wino / chargino production by vbf processes followed by decay to the lightest neutralino through either a light slepton or a light stau was studied in final states with two forward jets , missing energy , and either dilepton or ditau , respectively .",

    "in this section , we describe the main challenges of obtaining viable non - thermal scenarios .",
    "this is a classic problem in most non - thermal scenarios @xcite .",
    "the gravitino must decay before bbn ; moreover it is important to note that the gravitino is typically the last particle to decay , not the modulus . a source of non - thermal dm production , in addition to that coming from @xmath12 that has been studied already , is now provided by the gravitino .",
    "since the gravitino decays at a temperature @xmath114 , and dm annihilation rate must satisfy the fermi bounds  ( [ fermi ] ) , annihilation is very inefficient at this time .",

    "the leading decay channels for @xmath153 are to higgses ( through a gm term ) and closed string axions . in particular ,",
    "in contrast to the kklt scenario , the volume modulus only has a radiatively induced coupling to the gauge kinetic function ; thus , decays to gauginos ( and gauge bosons ) is loop suppressed in this case .",
    "depending on the way in which the modulus couples to the visible sector , there are two regimes for the reheat temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the case of high @xmath154 gev is realised when the modulus decays mainly to higgses , and corresponds to the annihilation scenario .",
    "the branching scenario may be accommodated and the reheat temperature lowered to @xmath155 mev if the modulus decays mainly to gauge bosons ( or if the decay to higgses is suppressed ) .",

    "the overproduction of dark radiation may be avoided if bulk and local axions are eaten by anomalous @xmath133s , or by suitable choice of parameters . _      to address the various challenges of non - thermal scenarios with a gravitationally coupled modulus , one needs to satisfy non - trivial conditions on the khler geometry of the underlying effective supergravity theory , as we have seen .",
    "an alternative is to shift model - building to a visible sector scalar field that decays and gives rise to the non - thermal history .    in a model constructed in @xcite , the late decay of an @xmath0-parity even scalar field @xmath12 that is a sm singlet ( but",

    "one can obtain @xmath116 for @xmath161 tev , @xmath162 tev , and @xmath163 .    the branching fraction for @xmath12 decay to dm particles @xmath37 depends on the nature of the lsp .",

    "one can obtain the observed relic abundance in both larger and smaller annihilation cross - section regions of susy parameter space .",
    "gravitino production from @xmath12 decay is naturally suppressed by the virtue of @xmath12 belonging to the visible sector .",

    "it can accommodate both branching and annihilation scenarios through a combination of charge selection , interactions , and kinematics .",
    "late decay typically will require a small yukawa coupling @xmath168 . _",
    "the fact that the yield from modulus decay @xmath131 is a small number @xmath169 is suggestive .",
    "it is small because the reheat temperature for a modulus with mass @xmath170 tev is so low ( due to the fact that it decays gravitationally ) . given that in baryogenesis and dm physics we are trying to explain number densities @xmath171 , it is interesting to think that this value is driven by the smallness of @xmath131 , with the remainder being accounted for by branching ratios and loop factors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can consider dm and baryon asymmetry both being directly produced from a common source , i.e. , the decay of a modulus ( hence the name cladogenesis ) . in particular , dm annihilation is irrelevant i.e. we are in the branching scenario .",

    "the branching scenario requires @xmath173 and the asymmetry per decay is at least loop suppressed for natural @xmath11 couplings leading to @xmath174 .",
    "the value of @xmath175 is model - dependent , but if @xmath75 is non - colored , simple counting of degrees of freedom suggests @xmath176 .",

    ", one can work out a variant of the superpotential in  eq .",
    "[ superpot ] , but with two flavors of singlets @xmath75 , and which can now be arranged to be heavy in this case .",
