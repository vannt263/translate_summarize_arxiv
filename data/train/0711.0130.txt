    "the use of magnetic quantum oscillations @xcite as a means of analyzing the fermi surfaces of low - dimensional materials has received interest in recent years , particularly with respect to organic compounds such as the metallic varieties of the charge transfer salts bedt - tff ( see reviews by singleton @xcite and kartsovnik @xcite ) .",
    "one interesting feature of such systems is that the magnetic quantum oscillations can render measurable an apparent difference between the canonical ( closed ) and grand canonical ( open ) ensembles ( in which the density of electrons @xmath2 or the chemical potential @xmath3 are fixed , respectively ) ; in the former case the chemical potential @xmath3 will oscillate , and this will have a noticeable effect on the behavior of the magnetic oscillations of a two- or quasi - two - dimensional system .    in two dimensional multi - band metals , frequency mixing in the de haas - van alphen effect resulting from chemical potential magneto - oscillations",
    "has been predicted @xcite , studied analytically and numerically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite in closed systems .",
    "the theoretical description has been generalized to the more realistic quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) case @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proposed that finite amplitudes due to mixing between extremal cross - sections of the warped fermi surface of a _ single _ band closed quasi-2d system might also be observed @xcite ; unlike the previous examples , this particular mixing effect can not be replicated by magnetic breakdown @xcite .",
    "attention has recently turned to the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations of the longitudinal conductivity of quasi-2d single - band metals , with quantum transport theory being used by champel and mineev @xcite to examine the ultra - high field , 2d limit , and by grigoriev @xcite to examine the intermediate ( quasi-2d ) field limit .",
    "while much regarding the detailed physics of the former case remains obscure @xcite , analysis of the latter case while taking into account scattering in the self - consistent born approximation with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dingle temperature and @xmath6 the interplane transfer integral , has resulted in a proposed explanation of a few oddities in the observed oscillations  namely , the existence of slow oscillations and the field dependent phase shifts of the beats of the conductivity .    in what follows , we examine the behavior of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath0 in a field perpendicular to the highly conducting plane of a quasi-2d _ multiband _ metal .",
    "we begin by deriving an expression for the conductivity of a two - band metal in the abscence of any scattering or chemical potential oscillations in section [ sec : fixedtau ] .",
    "we then ( section [ sec : seinter ] ) derive an expression for the self - energy of a system in the born approximation where there exists scattering between two bands , which we will have need of in some of our following calculations .    in the section following that , we calculate the effects of chemical potential oscillations and different forms of scattering on the system .",
    "firstly , in section [ sec : omunoscat ] we consider a closed system with a fixed relaxation time @xmath1 , then in section [ sec : gpintra ] an open system with oscillations in @xmath1 arising from intra - band scattering ( this is merely a two - band generalisation of grigoriev s @xcite result ) , in section [ sec : cpintra ] a closed system with oscillations in @xmath1 arising from intra - band scattering , in section [ sec : gpcond ] an open system with oscillations in @xmath1 arising from inter - band scattering , and finally in section [ sec : cpcond ] a closed system with oscillations in @xmath1 arising from inter - band scattering . in all cases other than the second we discover some measure of frequency mixing , though the precise behaviour of such mixing varies according to its origin .",
    "interestingly , as argued at the beginning of section [ sec : calc ] , one would probably not expect frequency mixing due to inter - band scattering to be very significant in the dhva effect ; that it is present in open systems in the sdh effect seems to indicate that one distinction between open and closed low - dimensional thermodynamic systems is slightly blurred in the case of conductivity .",
    "a quasi-2d metal in a longitudinal magnetic field has the following energy spectrum @xcite : @xmath7    where @xmath8 labels the band , @xmath9 is the distance between layers , @xmath10 labels the landau level , @xmath11 is the momentum in the perpendicular direction and @xmath12 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath13 being the effective mass for that band , and @xmath14 .",
    "we may calculate the conductivity from the kubo formula @xcite @xmath15\\overline{\\mbox{tr}\\left[\\delta(\\xi - h)\\hat v_z\\delta(\\xi - h)\\hat v_z\\right]},\\ ] ]    with @xmath16 being the velocity operator for the @xmath17-direction , @xmath18 being the derivative of the fermi function , the trace being taken over all the single particle states @xmath19 and the spin , @xmath20 is the volume of the system , and the bar denotes the averaging over the random distribution of impurities in the sample",
    ". we may , if the impurities are point - like , their concentration is low and @xmath4 , neglect the vertex corrections to the average and replace @xmath21 with @xmath22 , where @xmath23    is the retarded green s function and @xmath24 is the retarded self - energy ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 being real ) , to obtain @xmath27\\sum_\\alpha \\sum_\\gamma v_{z\\alpha,\\,\\gamma}^2[\\im g^r(\\epsilon_{\\alpha,\\gamma},\\xi)]^2.\\ ] ]    this is simply the initial conductivity formula of references @xcite , only now generalized so that it sums over multiple bands . restricting our interest to the case of two bands with different masses @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and since @xmath4 , we may use the approximation @xmath30 , making the calculation analytically tractable ) .",

    "let us assume that the quantum oscillations in the self - energy are suppressed , with the result that we can ignore the oscillatory contribution to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath1 is the mean scattering time and @xmath5 is the associated dingle temperature .",
    "this is justified in the presence of a field and size independent reservoir of states @xcite , for example , which suppresses both chemical potential oscillations and any oscillations in the self - energy .",
    "having made this assumption , we integrate over @xmath42 ( using the delta - function - like behavior of @xmath43 near the fermi energy at small @xmath44 to obtain the first term , and @xmath45 to obtain the damping factor for the oscillatory terms ) and so acquire : @xmath46,\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the dingle reduction factor , and @xmath50 is the usual lifshitz - kosevitch reduction factor .",

    "one will observe the splitting of each fundamental in the fourier transform of the conductivity into a pair of peaks ( a low - frequency ` neck ' peak and a high - frequency ` belly ' peak ) , which is evidence of the slight warping of the fermi - surface such that there are two extremal orbits present@xcite .",
    "if scattering between bands is possible , then the self energy of the particles in any given band will contain contributions from all other bands in addition to that due to intra - band scattering . in that case , in order to obtain the conductivity in the self - consistent born approximation in the two band case , we must include the impurity diagrams from both bands in @xmath55 @xcite : @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the square of the scattering amplitude , which is proportional to the impurity concentration and set equal to the same constant in every band for simplicity .",
    "it also includes a factor of 2 from the summation over the spin . following reference",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this , we can see that there is an oscillatory contribution from the real part of the self - energy that must be taken into account in our calculations , and a slowly varying part @xmath59 which may be ignored . using our symmetric approximation ( equation ( [ eqn : symmapp ] ) ) and setting @xmath60 ( as the average dingle temperature is simply related to the average value of the imaginary part of the self - energy due to scattering ) we may write the imaginary and oscillating real parts of the self energy as follows : @xmath61,\\label{eqn : deltasc}\\ ] ] @xmath62    equation ( [ eqn : deltasc ] ) is a non - linear equation for @xmath63 which can be solved approximately in the strong damping limit @xmath64 , as we shall see in section [ sec : gpcond ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the effects of chemical potential oscillations and of various kinds of scattering on the conductivity .",
    "it should be noted that this analysis takes place in a region where there is strong damping of the amplitudes by the factor @xmath65  we do not work in the region where the processes giving rise to mixing frequencies are at their strongest , and that given that the effects we are interested in are of the second order in @xmath65 , they may be quite small . however , it has been noted ( by comparison to numerical results ) in the case of dhva oscillations @xcite that a reasonable level of accuracy may be maintained even if one allows the dingle damping factor to tend towards unity , assuming that one is in the appropriate limit regarding the behaviour of @xmath3 .",
    "this might also be the case with respect to the sdh oscillations where mixing due to inter - band scattering is present .    indeed , it would be suprising if our analysis of those systems were not even qualitiatively correct ( with regards to the presence of frequency mixing at the very least ) outside of the region where @xmath66 , since the amplitudes contain a denominator @xmath63 which becomes more important as it becomes smaller and @xmath65 therefore approaches unity .",
    "interestingly , this would not be the case with regards to dhva oscillations  as can be seen from equation ( 68 ) of @xcite , @xmath63 enters only through the dingle damping factor and the cosine function .",
    "this entails that , as @xmath65 approaches 1 , the oscillating portions of @xmath63 become negligible  it is doubtful , therefore , that one would be able to observe frequency mixing due to scattering in the dhva oscillations of any but the dirtiest systems .    in cases where slow oscillations of the conductivity exist ,",
    "it should be noted that it has been observed @xcite that macroscopic inhomogeneities in the sample increase the damping of the fast oscillations over and above that expected by simple scattering ; this can be modeled by replacing the dingle temperature in the @xmath65 factors of those oscillations with a new , larger dingle temperature @xmath67 that will enhance the damping of their amplitudes . in order to simplify our discussion , though",
    ", we ignore this complication for now , though it should be taken into account in any physical measurement .      in closed systems ,",
    "the particle density is fixed and we work in the canonical ensemble . as a result of this , the chemical potential @xmath3 of the system may oscillate . in three dimensions",
    "these oscillations are negligible , however , as mentioned previously , in the case of multiband 2d and quasi-2d metals with two bands one discovers additional harmonics corresponding to frequency mixing between bands . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the effects of these oscillations on the conductivity of a system in which scattering effects are suppressed .",
    "this situation is physical if the oscillations in @xmath1 are suppressed due to a large amplitude of scattering from quantised bands to the resevoir , which is consistent with the existence of a small enough resevoir density of states for the oscillations in @xmath3 to remain significant .",
    "following reference @xcite we divide the chemical potential into an oscillating part @xmath68 and a non - oscillating part @xmath69 : @xmath70    where @xmath71    with @xmath72 being the oscillatory portion of the thermodynamic potential @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 being the unquantized background density of states which we treat as being negligible , and @xmath76 being the quantized density of states for the band @xmath8 . using formula ( 14 ) of reference @xcite and the 2d density of states @xmath77 , we acquire @xmath78    where @xmath79    which follows from the use of the asymptotic @xmath80    let us assume that the system is strongly damped : @xmath66 , and we keep only the oscillating terms of second order in @xmath65 or less .",
    "it follows that @xmath81 , so we may expand ( [ eqn : ftaufmu ] ) in @xmath68 and approximate @xmath69 with @xmath3 .",
    "we then insert ( [ eqn : mutilde ] ) , again approximating the argument of the sine function as @xmath82 , and so obtain @xmath83    where @xmath84 represents the unmixed portion of the conductivity and @xmath85 is the mixed portion .",

    "this slow oscillation is not seen in dhva oscillations ( such as those of reference @xcite , for example ) ; in those cases , one sees only the fast oscillations whose frequencies are determined by @xmath6 and @xmath3 together , with no slow oscillations whose frequencies are determined by @xmath6 alone .    the mixed component of the conductivity is given by @xmath87    where @xmath88    and it is this term which gives rise to the frequency mixing induced by the chemical potential oscillations .",

    ".    one important feature of the mixing amplitudes in this case is that they are identical for both the additive and the subtractive mixing frequencies .",
    "this does not generally hold , as we shall see in what follows .",
    "working in the self - consistent born approximation , let us assume that there is no scattering between the bands , and that we work in an open system described by the grand canonical ensemble . in this case",
    "the only diagrams contributing to the self energy of an electron in band @xmath8 will be those corresponding to intra - band scattering , and there are no chemical potential oscillations that could also result in a mixing of oscillation frequencies .",
    "this is the situation described by grigoriev @xcite .",

    "<S> we analyze the behavior of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath0 in a field perpendicular to the highly conducting plane of a quasi-2d _ multiband _ metal in the case of closed system and open systems where @xmath1 is fixed , @xmath1 oscillates due to intra - band scattering and @xmath1 oscillates due to inter - band scattering . in all but one case </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there are also mixing frequencies present  however they exhibit different qualitative behaviors , as befits their different origins , and in the case of inter - band scattering in an opensystem , may in fact be absent in the dhva oscillations of that system . </S>"
