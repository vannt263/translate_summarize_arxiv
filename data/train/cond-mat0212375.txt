    "the observation of the kondo effect in semiconducting quantum dots @xcite has opened a new area of research in which electronic transport through a nanoscale strongly correlated system can be studied under controlled conditions .",
    "more recently , this effect has also been observed in carbon nanotubes coupled to metallic electrodes , a system that can behave in many respects as a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "these type of devices provide an almost ideal system to test different theoretical predictions . in this direction ,",
    "a great theoretical interest has arisen in connection with the possibility of replacing the normal electrodes by superconducting ones .",
    "in fact , carbon nanotubes connected to superconducting leads , that are already being produced , can provide a physical realization of such a system @xcite .    in these type of systems an issue of fundamental relevance",
    "is the interplay between electron correlation effects and andreev reflection processes , which provide the basic mechanism for transport between normal and superconducting regions .",
    "this interplay has been analyzed by several authors for the case of quantum dot coupled to a normal and a superconducting electrode @xcite .",
    "there have also been some works addressing the problem of the electron transport mediated by multiple andreev reflections through a resonant level between two superconducting electrodes @xcite .    when both electrodes are superconducting a more basic question",
    "is how the electron - electron interactions in the dot would affect the josephson current .",
    "this issue has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the discussion has been centered to a large extent around the appearance of a @xmath0-junction behavior induced by electron - electron interactions .",
    "the @xmath0-junction behavior , which consists in a reversal of the sign of the supercurrent under certain conditions , was first pointed out by kulik @xcite when analyzing the josephson tunneling in the presence of magnetic impurities , and discussed afterwards by several authors @xcite .",
    "this issue is also related to the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "@xmath0-junction behavior has in fact been recently observed in s - f - s josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical works analyzing the josephson effect in a single correlated level coupled to superconducting leads have adopted either a mean field description @xcite or are restricted to some limiting situations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the current was obtained to the lowest order in the tunneling coupling , thereby neglecting the important physics associated with the andreev bound states . on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion was considered .    at this point",
    "we believe that further work is needed to understand the physical behavior of this system for a broad parameter range .",
    "this behavior is actually rather complex due to the several energy scales involved . in particular , as the andreev bound states play a crucial role in the transport properties , a detailed analysis of electron correlation effects on these states seems desirable . in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical study of the josephson effect in a single level quantum dot coupled to superconducting electrodes .",
    "different approaches are considered .",
    "we first study the zero band - width limit in which the problem can be exactly diagonalized .",
    "then , as an approximation to the full model we use a diagrammatic expansion of the self - energy associated with the coulomb interaction in which the coupling to the superconducting leads is taken into account up to infinite order .",
    "this last ingredient is important for a proper description of the andreev bound states .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the theoretical model and discuss the diagrammatic approximations for the electron self - energy . in section",
    "iii we present a simplified version of this model in which the coulomb interaction is replaced by an effective exchange field .",
    "this simple model already describes the @xmath0-junction transition and allows to understand the behavior of the andreev states under a finite magnetization in the dot .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of the zero band - width limit in which the model becomes equivalent to a finite system which can be solved exactly .",
    "the exact solution is then used as a test of the approximations used for the electron self - energy .",
    "it turns out that the zero band - width limit can describe rather accurately most of the properties of the full model .",
    "the results for the full model are presented in section v. we first discuss two opposite limiting situations in which the coupling of the dot to the leads is either small or large compared to the superconducting gap . as in the zero band - width limit ,",
    "in the case of weak coupling we show that the problem can be solved exactly .",
    "we also present some numerical results for the intermediate regime .",
    "the paper is closed by a brief summary of the main conclusions .",
    "we describe a small quantum dot connected to superconducting electrodes by means of a modified single - level anderson model , given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the uncoupled superconducting leads ; @xmath5 describing the coupling between the dot level and the leads . within this model",
    "the dot is represented by a single spin degenerate level with a repulsive coulomb interaction described by the @xmath6-term in eq .",
    "we shall assume that the superconducting leads are well described by the bcs theory with a superconducting gap @xmath7 and that there is a fixed superconducting phase difference @xmath8 between both electrodes .",
    "the relevant quantities like the current and the spectral densities can be expressed in terms of non - equilibrium green functions @xcite .",
    "for the description of the superconducting state it is useful to introduce spinor field operators @xcite , which in a site representation are defined as :    @xmath9    then , the different correlation functions appearing in the keldysh formalism adopt the standard causal form :    @xmath10>\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the chronological ordering operator along the keldysh time contour .",

    "@xcite . in that work",
    "the mean field solution was simplified by neglecting the induced order parameter in the dot and imposing self - consistency only in the dot magnetization .",
    "however , the complete hartree - fock bogoliubov solution requires the self - consistent determination of both the diagonal and non - diagonal charges in the dot .",
    "it should be noticed that the self - consistent determination of the induced complex order parameter is in principle necessary in order to ensure current conservation @xcite .      in order to go beyond the mean field approximation",

    "the proper choice of the unperturbed one - electron hamitonian over which the diagrammatic expansion is performed is an important issue . for the normal anderson model in the symmetric case",
    "@xmath44 the hartree approximation which renormalizes the dot level as @xmath45 is the adequate starting point for the perturbation theory as it automatically warrants charge consistency between the perturbed and the unperturbed situation .",
    "however , in a non - symmetric case perturbation over the hartree field yields pathological results close to half - filling ( see @xcite ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite a better choice is to define an effective dot level @xmath46 in such a way that charge consistency between the effective and the interacting problems is achieved .",
    "the natural extension of this scheme to the superconducting case is to impose also consistency in the non - diagonal charge @xmath47 by introducing an effective local pairing potential @xmath48 in the unperturbed hamiltonian @xcite .    with these definitions ,",

    "in contrast , in the magnetic case , the deviation between the exact and the mean field solution first increases in the small @xmath6 range while it progressively decreases for large @xmath6 .",
