    "over the past few decades , the problem of growth of aggregates by sequential stochastic deposition developed into one of the most extensively studied topics in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "much effort has been put into theoretical , numerical , and experimental investigation of the resulting patterns .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed , including the famous kardar  parisi  zhang ( kpz ) @xcite and edwards  wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite models , the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) @xcite and eden @xcite models , the models of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite , polynuclear growth ( png ) @xcite , and several ramifications of the ballistic deposition ( bd ) model @xcite . within the latter , in the simplest setting",
    ", one assumes that elementary units ( `` particles '' ) follow ballistic trajectories in space and adhere sequentially to a growing aggregate ( `` heap '' ) . despite its extremely transparent geometric formulation ,",
    "the problem of stochastic growth still is one of the most puzzling problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "the available theoretical analysis of stochastic deposition focuses almost exclusively on the enveloping surface @xmath1 , involving a statistical study of its height distribution and the corresponding scaling exponents .",
    "here we quote just a few prominent results .",
    "the essential scaling relations characterizing the growing aggregate are @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 is an average speed of growth , and @xmath5 is a rescaled correlation function . the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 were determined already in @xcite for the kpz model and then observed in a variety of other growth models .",
    "then in refs  @xcite it was realized that the distribution of a rescaled png height @xmath8 converges as @xmath9 to the tracy ",
    "widom distribution @xcite for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , which appears in the theory of random matrices .",
    "moreover , the full rescaled png surface @xmath10 converges to a version of the airy stochastic process @xmath11 @xcite whose one - point distributions are precisely tracy  widom .",
    "distribution of maximal heights of the @xmath0 dimensional edwards  wilkinson and kpz interfaces has been determined exactly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the bd model considered below involves the _ point - to - line _ last - passage percolation while png corresponds to the _ point - to - point _ setting  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly the limit processes are different : it is @xmath12 for the point - to - line and @xmath13 for the point - to - point . note also that the one - point distribution for the @xmath12 process is given by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) distribution rather than the gue distribution , which corresponds to  @xmath13 .    since a similar convergence to airy processes",
    "is observed in other growth models such as tasep @xcite , it is becoming customary to speak of `` the kpz universality class '' whenever such limit behavior is present .",
    "for example , a kpz scaling has been shown in refs@xcite for the bd model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "much less is known , however , about the structure of bd patterns _ beneath _ the enveloping surface .",
    "here is just one puzzle : analytic arguments @xcite predict that the expected density @xmath14 of local surface maxima in a @xmath0 dimensional ballistically growing heap is @xmath15 , whereas extensive numerical simulations show that the mean bulk density , @xmath16 , of the @xmath0 dimensional heap is about @xmath17 . to date",
    "there is no satisfactory quantitative explanation of this mismatch .",
    "the statistics of the growing heap are determined by its striking internal structure , revealed in numerical simulations as well as in the recent experimental analysis of electrochemically formed silver branched patterns @xcite .",
    "this structure consists of a `` forest '' formed by tree  like clusters of different size , which are separated by a dual network of tree  like channels or `` crevices '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .    as the heap grows , clusters randomly collect particles and thus spread and isolate their neighbors from the `` rainfall '' of incident particles , suffocating their growth .",
    "consequently the number of clusters present at height @xmath18 in a growing aggregate is a decreasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "we remark that this `` suffocation '' mechanism , as well as the growth patterns in the bd model , bear certain similarity to those observed in diffusion limited aggregation in a hard  core lattice gas on a zero  temperature boundary  @xcite , although the two models belong to different universality classes and their quantitative behaviors are in no direct correspondence .    in the present work we undertake investigation of clusters and crevices based on a novel systematic analogy with turbulent structures in",
    "randomly forced hamilton  jacobi equations .",
    "this allows us to conclude that bd belongs to a large group of models within the kpz universality class , such as png model , tasep , and others .",
    "it turns out that bd like other models mentioned above admits a variational formulation .",
    "moreover the analogy with hamilton ",
    "jacobi dynamics enables us to suggest a novel concept of _ equipped airy process _ , a buildup on top of classical airy processes which also takes into account the geometrical structure of the optimal paths ( maximizers of the action , see section  [ sect:3 ] ) .",
    "the random field of optimal paths arises naturally in the context of stochastically forced burgers equation @xcite .    in a recent experimental work @xcite the size distribution @xmath19 of frozen structures formed by",
    "electrochemically grown silver branching patterns has been analyzed .",
    "the authors found that the probability @xmath19 to have a cluster of size @xmath20 exhibits scale invariance , i.e.  @xmath21 , with a critical exponent @xmath22 . in our work",
    "we compute this exponent analytically ( @xmath23 ) and show that the scaling behavior conjectured in @xcite actually holds as well as two other power laws governing the `` thinning '' of the forest of clusters with increasing height and the transversal fluctuations of the cluster boundaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect:2 ]",
    "we specify the model and define its main structural features .",
    "section [ sect:3 ] contains an analysis of the structural similarity of bd patterns to `` minimizers '' and `` shocks '' in the burgers turbulence @xcite , based on the common variational formulation of the two models . in section [",
    "sect : airy ] we discuss the kpz scaling in the bd model and introduce the notion of an equipped airy process .",
    "building on these developments , in section [ sect : scaling ] we compute the main scaling exponents of the bd model .",

    "a standard @xmath0 dimensional bd model with next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions can be formulated as follows ( see also refs@xcite ) .",
    "consider a box divided into @xmath24 columns of unit width each , enumerated with index @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "the height @xmath49 relaxes spontaneously even in the absence of deposition to column @xmath25 at time @xmath48 because @xmath50 is defined to be the maximum of the triple @xmath51 .",
    "note that process described by eq .",
    "is sometimes referred to as `` dynamics with multiplicative noise . ''",
    "let us now take a closer look at fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we say that two particles in a heap are _ connected _ if they touch one another at corners or if one is situated directly on the top of the other .",
    "it often happens that the upper particle is connected simultaneously to two lower particles . for reasons that will become clear shortly ,",
    "it is better to avoid these `` one - on - two '' configurations .",
    "the model is therefore slightly augmented : one assumes in eqs   and that @xmath52 where @xmath53 are independent normal random variables .",
    "it is clear , and well supported by numerical experiments , that this modification removes the possibility of `` one - on - two '' configurations while preserving , within the limits of statistical errors , statistical characteristics of the heap for @xmath54 .",
    "alternatively one might resolve `` one - on - two '' configurations for @xmath55 by simply disconnecting the upper particle from one of its two lower neighbors at random .",
    "either way , elimination of one - on - two configurations allow us to define a unique `` path '' corresponding to every particle , namely a backward directed chain of connected particles going from a given particle to the bottom level of the heap .",
    "consider all connected paths originating from the topmost particles .",
    "these paths can merge .",
    "we define the * backbone * of a cluster as the connected set of such paths , i.e. , the union of all paths that end up at the same bottom level particle .",
    "it is easy to see that the bottom level particles are split into two classes : those that are reached by the paths originated at the top of the heap and those that are not . obviously the first class gets smaller as @xmath48 increases . for every particle from this class define * cluster * as the collection of all paths ending up at this particle .",
    "the difference between a backbone and a cluster is that clusters contain paths not necessarily originating from the top level particles .",
    "we say that a pair of two top level particles occupying adjacent columns defines a * shock * , which is located between them , if they belong to two different clusters .",
    "the channel of white space between two neighboring clusters is called a * crevice*. clearly every crevice is associated with a shock at the top , and the connected paths from top particles defining the shock form the left and right boundary of a crevice . connecting shocks at adjacent time moments ,",
    "we get curves that branch forward in time and play a role dual to that of backbones .",
    "these curves are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] in black .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that many channels that are initially present at bottom of the bulk then merge at some height , blocking the growth of the clusters situated in between .",
    "thus crevices have tree - like structure just as clusters , but contrary to clusters they merge upward .",
    "this causes the number of percolating clusters and crevices to decrease as a function of @xmath18 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this behavior is characterized by the following three scaling exponents whose values are identified in section  [ sect : scaling ] .",
    "the * thinning exponent * @xmath56 characterizes the expected number @xmath57 of percolating crevices ( or , equivalently , percolating clusters ) at height @xmath18 : @xmath58    the * wander exponent * @xmath59 characterizes the expected mean square displacement ( in the units of @xmath24 ) of the boundary of percolating cluster between the bottom of the bulk and a specified height  @xmath18 : @xmath60    the * mass exponent * @xmath61 characterizes the mass distribution of clusters : @xmath62 where @xmath19 is the proportion of clusters of mass  @xmath20 in the ensemble .",
    "the discrete equation @xmath63 + \\ell\\eta_{i}(t ) ,    \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] whose particular cases for specific choices of  @xmath64 are the bd model and the discrete png model , admits a natural variational formulation .",
    "fix some initial condition @xmath65 and consider the discrete `` variational '' problem of finding a trajectory @xmath66 that satisfies the `` boundary condition '' @xmath67 and maximizes the discrete `` action '' @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{eq:10}\\ ] ] the function in the square brackets plays a role of a discrete `` lagrangian '' of the system . the problem bears an obvious resemblance to the zero temperature limit of the free energy of a statistical system , expressed as the sum over configurations  @xmath69 : @xmath70 another obvious connection is with mechanics , where the dynamical trajectory can be found by optimizing the corresponding action ( in our case , at variance with the usual convention , the action is _ maximized _ ) .",
    "action maximization in eq .",
    "is related to solving eq .   as follows . to be specific ,",
    "consider the bd growth , where particles are added to the system as `` dropping events '' @xmath71 in @xmath0 dimensional discrete space - time .",
    "maximization of the action @xmath72 in   amounts to finding a trajectory that terminates at @xmath73 and passes through a maximal number of dropping events under the following constraint : the trajectory stays constant , @xmath74 , unless @xmath75 , i.e. , there is a dropping event in adjacent column . in the latter case",
    "the trajectory may ( but does _ not _ necessarily have to ) jump to @xmath76 at time step  @xmath77 .",
    "note that for the png model this constraint is relaxed : a trajectory may jump at all times , but only to adjacent columns .",
    "otherwise the two models are structurally similar , and the rest of the argument in this subsection applies to both .    the lack of a strict obligation to pass through an adjacent dropping event allows to `` collect '' dropping events more efficiently : it is easy to construct trajectories for which it is more profitable , from the point of view of maximizing the number of dropping events , to skip some isolated dropping events in order not to be driven away from a later series of several adjacent dropping events",
    ".    direct maximization of the action is a difficult problem because the solution depends on the whole future history of dropping events .",
    "observe however that for all @xmath78 , @xmath79 the height function @xmath80 gives the maximal number of dropping events available for a trajectory coming to the point @xmath81 , and this fact can be exploited to construct a maximizing trajectory in _ reverse _ time .",
    "consider again the bd case where @xmath82 .",
    "then the maximizing trajectory passing through an arbitrary @xmath73 can be reconstructed by setting @xmath67 and solving recursively @xmath83 + \\ell\\eta_{\\gamma(s)}(s )    \\label{eq:13}\\ ] ] for @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the standard notation for the value of @xmath86 that provides maximum to the expression in the r.h.s .  of  .    the algorithmic implementation of the above goes as follows .",
    "solve first eq .   `` upstairs '' starting from given initial conditions and obtain the set of values @xmath87 for all @xmath88 . then choose a specific point , say @xmath73 , and restore the path to this point going `` downstairs , '' i.e. , back in time , by solving eq .",
    "step by step .",
    "this procedure defines a trajectory maximizing the action @xmath72 in eq .  .",
    "this class of algorithms is known in the optimization theory as _ dynamic programming _ , and eq .",
    "is called the _ bellman equation _ ( see , e.g. , the classical book @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that there is a far - reaching analogy between the bd deposition model and phenomenology of `` shocks '' and `` minimizers '' for the burgers or hamilton  jacobi equation with random forcing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we first recall the latter .",
    "consider the inviscid burgers equation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the forcing potential .",
    "the substitution @xmath91 transforms this equation into @xmath92 more generally , one can consider the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a convex function representing the kinetic energy . using the legendre transform representation @xmath95 $ ] ,",
    "one can write @xmath96 with equality only for @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 . hence along any trajectory @xmath99 the rate of change of  @xmath18 is bounded by the lagrangian @xmath100 ( here @xmath101 ) , which implies for any @xmath69 passing through @xmath102 at time @xmath48 that @xmath103    = h(\\gamma(0 ) , 0 ) + \\int_0^t [ l(\\dot\\gamma ) - \\eta(\\gamma , s)]\\ , ds    \\label{eq:10c}\\ ] ] with equality only for * minimizers * of the action , which must satisfy the equation @xmath104    the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is thus intimately connected with the variational problem of minimizing the action , just as the bellman equation arises in maximization of the discrete `` action '' .",
    "note in particular the similar structure of the action ( the difference in sign results in maximization replacing minimization in the discrete case ) .",
    "moreover , a known solution @xmath18 to allows to reconstruct minimizing trajectories using , much as generates maximizing trajectories in the discrete problem .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the discrete maximizing trajectories defined in the previous subsection as analogs of continuous minimizers .",
    "there is one apparent difference : continuous minimizers never cross , while discrete maximizing paths merge and form tree - like structures .",
    "however continuous minimizers have a tendency to approach each other with exponential rate in reverse time due to hyperbolicity , and in the discrete case the same hyperbolicity manifests itself in the exponentially decreasing probability for two adjacent maximizers to stay separate as time runs backwards .",
    "we are now in position to establish the relation between discrete maximizers and connected paths defined within the heap in section  [ sect:2 ] .",
    "lift the maximizing trajectories to the @xmath105 space by setting @xmath106 for a maximizer @xmath69 such that @xmath67 .",
    "then connected paths are given by the projection of these `` lifted '' maximizers to the @xmath107 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] ) .",
    "in other words , the intervals of time between successive dropping events along a maximizer are collapsed into unit steps in  @xmath18 .",
    "correspondingly the transversal fluctuations of maximizers as a function of time are transformed to transversal fluctuations of connected path as a function of height @xmath18 .",
    "the analogy between continuous minimizers and discrete maximizers extends to shocks . in the burgers turbulence",
    "it typically happens that two or more minimizing trajectories , which start at different initial locations , pass through same point  @xmath102 at time  @xmath48 , so that the map from @xmath108 to the initial location is discontinuous ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these discontinuities are called * shocks * ; in spacetime they form continuous shock curves .",
    "this definition is obviously parallel to the definition of shocks given in the bd setting in section  [ sect:2 ] ( and has inspired the latter ) .",
    "recall first the basics of classical kpz scaling related to @xmath12 process , which is closest to our setting .",
    "the scheme described below is due to sasamoto  @xcite .",
    "consider a directed random walk on a @xmath0 dimensional lattice .",
    "suppose that the space - time lattice is equipped by a random potential with independent values @xmath109 at each point  @xmath110 .",
    "then for every @xmath25 one can consider the maximum of an action over all random walk paths of length @xmath48 terminating at that point , i.e. , define @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a `` kinetic '' part of the action that ensures a certain control of how far the trajectory  @xmath69 can jump over unit time steps .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath113 at @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is some nonrandom constant independent of @xmath25 .",
    "we now consider the rescaled process @xmath116    the main statement is that @xmath117 converges as @xmath118 to a universal spatially homogeneous limit process called @xmath119 .",
    "universality here means that whenever one optimizes in a disordered medium the action of a path from a point that varies over a line to a parallel line separated from the first one by distance @xmath48 ( `` point - to - line last - passage percolation '' ) , the process corresponding to the optimal action converges as @xmath118 to the @xmath12 process .",
    "note that spatial homogeneity of @xmath119 immediately follows from the construction .",
    "of course one has to ensure convergence by subtracting the mean value of order @xmath48 , normalizing the difference by @xmath120 and rescaling the starting point by  @xmath121 .",
    "the constants @xmath56 and @xmath59 in   are nonuniversal and should be chosen properly to ensure convergence to the standard airy process .",
    "a  similarly rescaled `` point - to - point '' percolation results in the @xmath13 process .      as we have shown in section  [ sect:3 ] the height function in the bd process can be viewed as given by maximization procedure for random paths in random potential .",
    "the only difference with the classical picture just described is related to the rarity of the deposition events . in other words , in order to achieve the displacement of order 1 in space direction one needs time of order  @xmath24 .",
    "this explains why time has to be rescaled .",
    "the most natural way to do this is through a local stochastic change of time variable .",
    "namely we collapse the time between two deposition events to  @xmath31 .",
    "this is exactly the transformation from ( lifted ) maximizers to connected paths presented in section  [ sect:3 ] .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that the @xmath12 process can be obtained from the bd height function : @xmath122 this formula simply indicates that the appropriately rescaled height function in bd is the visualization of the process which converges in the thermodynamic limit to the airy process .",
    "the @xmath12 process carries only part of the information about the system : it is oblivious to the maximizing trajectory associated to the ( rescaled ) point  @xmath108 .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the limit @xmath123 { } ( airy_1(x ) , \\gamma_x(s)),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the maximizing trajectory that passes through  @xmath25 at time  @xmath48 and @xmath125 is a continuous path defined over @xmath126 $ ] such that @xmath127 .",
    "we call this limit the _ equipped airy process_.    as just before , in the bd setting we collapse time intervals between adjacent deposition events to unit steps and get particle paths instead of maximizing trajectories in formula   above . applying transversal rescaling @xmath128 and height rescaling @xmath129 as in",
    ", we get a realization of equipped airy process from the rescaled bd heap .",
    "this process describes the joint distribution of fluctuations of the height function and transversal displacements of cluster boundaries in the spatially homogeneous bd process .",
    "in other words , the rescaled height function for the bd model alone is a realization of the @xmath12 process , while the rescaled height function together with the rescaled forest of maximizers corresponds to a realization of the equipped airy process .",
    "the distinctive geometric features of this joint process suggests the name `` * * hairy airy process * * , '' cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : what_corr]a .",
    "+   +    we demonstrate the existence of correlations in the joint distribution for the hairy airy process by computing numerically the joint distribution of the height fluctuation @xmath130 at the top of a shock and the corresponding displacement @xmath131 of the cluster boundary .",
    "to be precise , we compute the correlation coefficient between the fluctuations of the displacement @xmath131 of the right boundary of a cluster ( or equivalently a backbone ) and the height fluctuation @xmath130 at the top right point of the same cluster , see fig .",
    "[ fig : what_corr]a . for convenience",
    "we explicitly recall here the standard definition of the correlation coefficient @xmath132 between two random variables @xmath133 and @xmath134 : @xmath135    let the top right particle of some cluster be located at time  @xmath48 in column  @xmath136 .",

    "behavior of the corresponding time - dependent correlation coefficient @xmath143 , where the angle brackets correspond to averaging over the sample , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : what_corr]b for different time values .",
    "strong correlations between the vertical and horizontal displacements of cluster boundaries are clearly seen in the data .",
    "the negative sign of these correlations is due to the fact that the height of the top right particle in a typical cluster is smaller than the averaged height of the growing bd interface .",
    "this observation is supported by fig .",
    "[ fig : what_corr]c , where the averaged difference between the height of the cluster right boundary and the averaged height of the interface is plotted against time .",
    "clearly this difference is always negative and tends to  @xmath27 from below as @xmath144 .",
    "one may speculate that growth of the left- and ritghmost connected paths in a cluster is slower due to screening between neighboring clusters .",
    "in order to better understand the influence of clusters on the morphological structure of the growing bd surface , we also compute the joint distribution of height fluctuations in two columns separated by distance @xmath145 in lattice units , as shown in fig .  [",

    "two different situations are distinguished : i ) two test column belong to the same cluster ( configuration @xmath146 ) , and ii ) two test columns belong to different clusters , i.e. , are separated by a shock ( configuration @xmath147 ) .",
    "+    computing the correlation coefficient @xmath148 according to  , we see that correlations between @xmath149 and @xmath150 inside a cluster are stronger than those across a shock between different clusters .",
    "relying on the connection between shocks and boundaries of clusters , we can directly transfer the scaling arguments of statistics of shocks developed in  @xcite to the scaling analysis of a growing bd heap and determine the values of the scaling exponents @xmath56 and @xmath59 in the dependencies @xmath151 and @xmath152 defined correspondingly in eqs   and  . recall that @xmath153 is the averaged number of clusters percolating to height  @xmath18 and @xmath154 is the mean square displacement of a cluster boundary at height  @xmath18 .",

    "in what follows we shall use the obvious fact that the growth time  @xmath48 in the sequential deposition process is proportional to the average height  @xmath18 of the growing heap and , consequently , to the cluster height  see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig:3d]b .",
    "the typical value of @xmath158 can be obtained by scaling considerations .",
    "namely , growth of @xmath158 is determined by two additive effects . on the one hand",

    "consider clusters with size of order @xmath159 . under the uniform random `` rainfall '' of deposited particles ,",
    "one cluster can randomly screen part of its neighbors , and increase its own `` spot . ''",
    "since different clusters are correlated weakly , it is natural to conjecture that the typical scale of fluctuations of cluster sizes is of order of @xmath160 .",

    "the increments of @xmath165 are uncorrelated for the uniform ballistic `` rain '' and @xmath166 .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that @xmath167 as conjectured .    on the other hand",
    ", there is `` smearing '' of clusters due to the random deposition of new particles near the cluster boundary .",
    "this process can be interpreted as `` diffusion '' of the boundary . over time",
    "@xmath48 this diffusion leads to the smearing of the cluster s horizontal size on typical scale of order of @xmath168 .",
    "the typical size of a growing cluster at time  @xmath48 is determined by additive contributions of these two effects : @xmath169 the dominant contribution to @xmath155 comes from the first term , which is consistent with the physical intuition .",

    "( this estimate is a direct paraphrase of the arguments provided in @xcite for scaling analysis of statistics of shocks in the @xmath0 dimensional burgers equation with random forcing ) .    the density @xmath153 of independent clusters surviving up to the height @xmath18 is inversely proportional to the cluster size , @xmath173^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath174 which gives @xmath175 .",
    "furthermore , the typical horizontal mean square displacement @xmath176 of a cluster boundary at height  @xmath18 can be estimated simply as @xmath177 which gives @xmath178 .",
    "this section contains the scaling analysis of the probability @xmath179 to find a cluster of mass @xmath20 in a large aggregate . to begin with ,",
    "note that the number of particles , i.e. , the `` mass '' @xmath180 of a cluster percolating to height  @xmath18 can be obtained integrating the horizontal size , @xmath158 , of cluster at a given height : @xmath181 from we know that the cumulative probability of clusters surviving until height  @xmath18 is of the order of @xmath182 .",
    "this implies that the probability density of clusters at height  @xmath18 scales as @xmath183 . in order to calculate mass distribution",
    ", we change variables from  @xmath18 to  @xmath20 , take into account that @xmath184 , or @xmath185 , and get @xmath186 for @xmath187 we get @xmath23 .",
    "the exponent @xmath23 is well supported by our own numerical simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , and , as mentioned in introduction , it has been found in independent laboratory experiments on cluster formation in quasi - two - dimensional electrochemically formed silver branching structures @xcite .",
    "one can say that he clusters are ranked ( ordered ) according to their masses and @xmath20 is the corresponding rank .",
    ".   has similarity with the zipf s law that appears in many areas of science ranging from word statistics in linguistics @xcite to nuclear multifragmentation @xcite where clusters have power - law distribution in sizes ( masses , charges etc . ) .",
    "in this paper we analyze the internal structure of the heap formed in the course of standard homogeneous ballistic deposition with next ",
    "nearest  neighboring ( nnn ) interactions in a box .",
    "we have paid the most attention to the statistics of clusters and the channels ( crevices ) separating them .",
    "we have demonstrated that the bd process can be naturally described in terms of `` dynamic programming '' language associated with the so - called bellman equation .",
    "the `` dynamic programming '' point of view allows systematic translation of the study of clusters and crevices in the nnn ballistic deposition into the language of maximizers and shocks in discrete equations of the burgers or hamilton  jacobi type .",
    "this is the key point of our work",
    ". a detailed examination of the corresponding continuous limit will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "in particular , the results of the work @xcite concerning the statistics of shocks in @xmath188 dimensional burgers turbulence with random forcing allow the direct interpretation for statistics of cluster s boundaries ( crevices ) of growing heap .",
    "this connection between shocks and crevices has permitted us to compute the scaling exponents @xmath56 ( @xmath187 ) in the dependence @xmath189 , where @xmath57 is the average number of clusters , surviving up to height @xmath18 and @xmath59 ( @xmath178 ) for the mean square displacement @xmath190 of crevices as a function of the height @xmath18 of the heap .",
    "we have also extended the scaling analysis to the computation of the critical exponent @xmath61 ( @xmath23 ) of the mass distribution of clusters , @xmath191 , where @xmath19 is the probability density of clusters of mass  @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for comparison of numerical simulation with scaling dependence ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath61 coincides with the one found in real experiments on cluster formation in quasi  two dimensional electrochemically formed silver branching structures @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the morphological structure of surface of the growing heap splitted in clusters , has lead us to the definition of a new `` equipped '' airy process for bd , named the `` hairy airy process . '' in our preliminary investigation we have analyzed numerically its two - point correlation function and have shown the existence of essential correlations between the fluctuations of the displacement @xmath131 of the cluster s left boundary and the height s fluctuation @xmath130 in the top point of the same cluster s left boundary location , see fig .",
    "[ fig : what_corr]a .",
    "we believe that the described connection between crevices and shocks could be a useful tool for deeper understanding of both topics , nnn ballistic deposition and burgers turbulence . for nnn ballistic growth we could apply the machinery developed in turbulence , while for turbulence we could use nnn ballistic deposition for straightforward visualization of some complex chaotic behavior .",
    "let us end up by noting that many important and puzzling questions concerning the growth of the heap have not been touched in this paper .",
    "for instance , we have not discussed the question mentioned in the introduction : why the bulk density of the heap does not coincide with the density of local maxima of the growing surface .",
    "our guess is that the discrepancy between these densities , @xmath16 and @xmath14 is due to the presence of crevices in the heap .",
    "another example remaining almost without the attention deals with the consideration of aging in the growing heap .",
    "the investigation of the correlation between two heights inside a cluster and separated by the crevice considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlator ] gives some hint about the aging of the heap , however we have not considered the correlation between two heights separated by the crevice of finite depth .",
    "we are grateful to g. carlier for drawing our attention to the fact that both the nnn and png evolution processes can be expressed in terms of a bellman equation .",
