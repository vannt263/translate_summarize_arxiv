    "separable expansion schemes have always been extremely useful in solving few - body problems . for example , in the three - body systems , at any time starting from the 60 s , important new results have been achieved by solving the faddeev equations with some sort of separable representation of the two - body subsystems ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in more recent times , above all the separable expansion method proposed by ernst , shakin , and thaler @xcite ( the so - called est method ) has proven very useful .",
    "indeed , the first three - nucleon scattering results with such realistic meson - exchange n - n interactions like the paris potential were achieved along this method @xcite , and they were later on confirmed by a direct solution of the faddeev equations @xcite .    even nowadays when three - body faddeev equations can directly be solved on supercomputers ( for a recent review of the state of the art see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , separable expansion schemes have their relevance .",
    "not only does an accurate separable representation of the input dynamics allow to save much computer time in arriving at standard results , separable expansion methods may also help a lot in obtaining solutions to hitherto unsolved problems . in this respect",
    "we may mention the solution of the three - nucleon scattering problem with realistic n - n interactions and coulomb forces at any energy ; so far only limited solutions below or above breakup threshold have been obtained ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we deal with a separable expansion method that is well - adapted to treating few - body problems including long - range forces .",
    "its essence lies in the expansion of the potential operator @xmath0 of the short - range part of any interaction with the use of coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) functions @xcite .",
    "if the full potential also contains a coulomb interaction @xmath1 , this is kept in the green s operator .",
    "thereby all difficulties associated with a ( separable ) expansion of the coulomb potential are avoided , while at the same time correct asymptotic properties of all quantities are guaranteed .",
    "still the advantages of the separable expansion can be exploited in solving the two- and three - body integral equations .",
    "the cs separable expansion method has been extensively tested before in two - body problems",
    ". not only bound and resonant states with a variety of short - range plus coulomb potentials @xcite were investigated but also scattering solutions were obtained @xcite . in these works also",
    "convergence studies were performed and subsequently extended to the multichannel coulomb problem @xcite .",
    "computer codes for the cs separable expansion of any local or non - local two - body interaction under the presence of coulomb - like potentials were published in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ch .",
    "ii below we shall recall some of the most important formulae for the two - body problem .",
    "the principal advantage of the cs separable expansion is the fact that the matrix elements of the coulomb green s operator can be calculated analytically in the two - body system .",
    "besides the separable representation of the short - range part of the full interaction this turns out to be an essential requirement for an efficient and accurate solution of the three - body system . for the latter we may thus follow the integral - equation approach and thereby guarantee for the implementation of the appropriate ( coulomb - like ) asymptotics . in ch .",
    "iii below we shall demonstrate how the matrix elements of the three - body coulomb green s operator can be calculated in a reliable way .",
    "we prove the efficiency of our method through the solution of the faddeev equations for three - body bound states interacting via various short - range forces and a case with additional coulomb interaction among all three particles .",
    "we adhere to problems for which benchmark results from other methods have been obtained already .",
    "it is found that in all cases excellent agreement is achieved .",
    "the method therefore appears promising as an efficient tool for solving three - body systems , as it can be adapted to more general cases ( including three - body forces ) and extended to scattering under the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "we give a short account of the formalism of the cs separable expansion in the two - body system with short - range plus coulomb interactions . here",
    "we specify our notation and provide the formulae that are later on needed in the solution of the three - body problem .",

    "in this chapter we demonstrate the performance of the method in calculations of various three - body bound states .",
    "we have selected cases for which benchmark results are already available in the literature .",
    "the comparisons will prove the efficiency of our method , especially in the situation when coulomb forces are present .      before presenting the final results ,",
    "let us demonstrate the convergence of the results for the three - body bound - state energies .",
    "for this purpose we take the example of the ali - bodmer ( ab ) potential @xcite between @xmath29-particles of mass @xmath88 @xmath89 without and @xmath90 with coulomb interaction .",
    "we use units such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "evidently the quality of the results will depend on the number of terms employed in the separable expansion of the ( short - range ) potential .",
    "we quote the values of the binding energies from calculations without ( table [ tab ] ) and with ( table [ tabc ] ) coulomb forces , taking into account different numbers of channels @xmath93 ( corresponding to angular momentum states up to @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 employed ) . in all cases",
    "it is observed that convergence up to @xmath98 significant digits is comfortably achieved with @xmath99 terms applied for @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the separable expansion .",
    "remarkably the speed of the convergence is everywhere similar , irrespective of how many angular - momentum channels are included and whether or not coulomb forces are present .",
    "we note especially for the coulomb case that the satisfactory convergence stems from reliable separable expansions of the potentials @xmath0 and @xmath102 , which - from the point of view of scattering theory - are both short - range potentials ; the fall - off of @xmath102 is much slower than of @xmath0 , though .    in principle , the convergence may also depend on the ( range ) parameter @xmath5 of the coulomb - sturmian functions .",
    "we found , however , that the dependence is weak in a relatively large interval of possible choices , just as it was established in the two - body case @xcite .",
    "the convergence is practically of the same quality in the case of the other potentials considered below .",
    "we now present our converged results for the malfliet - tjon ( mt ) @xcite and ab @xcite potentials and compare them to other benchmark calculations . for the mt potential @xmath103 between two nucleons of mass m we consider two cases + mtva : @xmath104 @xmath105 + mtvb : @xmath106 @xmath107 + ( here we use units such that @xmath108 ) .",
    "for mtva we may compare to the results of the los alamos - iowa @xcite and groningen @xcite groups , both of which are obtained from a direct solution of the faddeev equations in configuration space , and in addition to results from an atms @xcite calculation , a green s function monte - carlo ( gfmc ) calculation @xcite , an integro - differential - equation approach ( idea ) @xcite , and a stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite . from table [ tmt5 ] it is evident that our method provides very accurate predictions for binding energies in all cases .",
    "this is true for the channel - by - channel comparison with the los alamos - iowa calculation and likewise for the comparison with the best results from the other works . with respect to the best results quoted in the lower rows of table [ tmt5 ] we note that for the corresponding calculations the number of angular - momentum channels employed is either not definitely known or not specified in a scheme like ours .    in order to demonstrate that in addition to binding energies our method also provides accurate three - body wave functions , we calculated the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius @xmath109 .",
    "corresponding results are given in table [ tmt5b ] for the mtvb potential , in which case we can compare to the calculations of the los alamos - iowa group @xcite .",
    "for both the binding energy and the rms radius the channel - by - channel comparison indicates perfect agreement .    in case of the mti - iii potential for a system of three fermions , acting in singlet and triplet states",
    ", we may compare to the 2-channels calculation of the los alamos - iowa group .",
    "for the mti - iii potential as parametrized in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain a binding energy ( converged result ) of @xmath110 in comparison to @xmath111 calculated by the los alamos - iowa collaboration .",
    "finally we come to the comparison of the results for the binding energy of a system of three bosons interacting via the ab and ab plus coulomb potential ( table [ tabcomp ] ) .",
    "we may compare our 4-channels result to calculations with the atms method @xcite ( uncharged case only ) and the svm @xcite .",
    "we do not know of any faddeev results in this case .",
    "again we show predictions for the binding energies and rms radii .",
    "all the values quoted in table [ tabcomp ] show a convincing agreement of our results with the ones from the other approaches .",
    "we specially stress the agreement of the result for the case of rigorously including the coulomb interaction with the rather reliable answer from the svm .",
    "we have suggested a separable expansion scheme , relying on coulomb - sturmian basis functions , for solving the three - body problem .",
    "the method is especially suited to the case when coulomb - like interactions are present in one or all subsystems .",
    "it allows to solve the three - body integral equations by expanding only the short - range part of the interaction in a separable form while keeping the effect of the long - range part in an exact manner via a proper integral representation of the three - body coulomb green s operator . as a consequence the method has good convergence properties and",
    "can practically be made arbitrarily accurate by employing an increasing number of terms in the separable expansion .",
    "the usage of the coulomb - sturmian basis is essential to allow for the accurate evaluation of the matrix elements of the coulomb green s operator .    beyond the studies of the method in systems with two - body asymptotics conducted before @xcite , we have now demonstrated its convergence properties and efficiency in ( benchmark ) calculations of the three - body bound - state problem without and with coulomb interactions . in both cases",
    "the solution of the faddeev equations show a rapid convergence , and , whenever a comparison is possible to existing results in the literature , correct predictions for the binding energies and wave functions are achieved .",
    "the method is capable of treating any kind of short - range interactions , even in the case when coulomb - like forces are present .",
    "the solution of the three - body bound - state problem was carried out here .",
    "however , the method is also applicable for scattering problems . in this regard",
    "it has been proven useful already in the two - body case @xcite . to solve the corresponding problem for a ( charged ) three - body system with the faddeev equations some technical details in connection with the evaluation of the then occurring matrix elements still need to be worked out .",
