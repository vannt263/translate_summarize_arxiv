    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are no longer viewed as a homogeneous population of `` red and dead '' systems that have ceased forming stars at late times .",
    "a mounting wealth of evidence indicates that some etgs have experienced recent or ongoing star formation ( sf ) . in the nearby universe ,",
    "the sauron survey @xcite has uncovered recent sf in a subset of the etgs in its sample .",
    "( note that the sauron galaxies are only a representative sample of local etgs rather than a complete , volume - limited sample . )",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath2 of sauron galaxies with infrared signatures of sf ( i.e. , pah emission ) are preferentially classified as `` fast rotators '' ( galaxies harboring an embedded disc component ) , while the non - star forming galaxies are `` slow rotators '' ( spheroidal , kinematically hot systems ) .",
    "this result was corroborated by a stellar population analysis of absorption line maps of the sauron galaxies : a subset of the fast rotators have ssp - equivalent ages consistent with recent sf , while slow rotators have uniformly old ages @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the fast rotators tend to be morphologically classified as s0 ( lenticular ) galaxies , while the slow rotators are almost exclusively e ( elliptical ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests a possible morphological dependence on the observed sf in etgs , with recent sf preferentially occurring in s0 galaxies .",
    "evidence for recent or ongoing sf in etgs is also found in much larger samples available from all - sky surveys , including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter provides uv measurements that are crucial in constraining recent sf @xcite . utilizing both sdss and galex photometry",
    ", @xcite showed that at least @xmath3 of their sample of 160 nearby ( @xmath4 ) etgs have blue uv - optical colors that they argue can only be attributed to low - level recent sf . with a larger sample of @xmath5 morphologically selected sdss etgs ,",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath2 of their sample have uv - optical colors consistent with sf occurring within the past 1 gyr , forming @xmath6@xmath7 of the total stellar mass .",
    "given these results , it is clear that recent sf in etgs is more prevalent than once believed .",
    "what remains uncertain is how to interpret such sf in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "as is well known , galaxies exhibit a bimodal color distribution , with star - forming galaxies located in the `` blue cloud '' and passively evolving objects located in the `` red sequence '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in between the blue cloud and red sequence",
    "lies the `` green valley '' ( gv ) , which is most apparent when studying uv - optical colors .",
    "the movement of galaxies through the gv is presumed to be a net flow from blue to red as a result of the quenching of sf in blue cloud galaxies and the resultant reddening of their colors @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "the etgs with recent sf are a mystery : is the observed sf the most recent phase of the original ( fading ? ) star formation , or is it a subsequent episode that has been triggered in a hitherto quiescent galaxy ?",
    "much attention has been focused on the latter explanation of the recent sf in etgs , which has been termed `` rejuvenation '' in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the newly triggered sf could drive a galaxy _ back into _",
    "the gv from the ( uv - optical ) red sequence . in this paper , `` rejuvenation '' is used to describe sf that causes a quiescent red sequence galaxy to move back into the gv .",
    "one possible cause of rejuvenated sf is gas accretion during gas - rich minor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the sf observed by galex in the outer regions of the nearby s0 galaxy ngc 404 is most likely fueled by an external reservoir of gas formed during a recent merger with a gas - rich dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "gas - rich major mergers can also trigger nuclear sf ; however , the infalling gas is also predicted to trigger strong agn feedback that expels or heats up the remaining cold gas , effectively quenching sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possible trigger for rejuvenated sf is smooth accretion from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "direct evidence for such accretion has been difficult to observe .",
    "however , the presence of extended reservoirs of neutral gas around etgs has been shown to be a fairly common phenomenon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of some of these disks has been attributed to accretion from the igm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the `` -normal '' galaxies in their sample of gv galaxies are experiencing recent sf that in a few cases may be rejuvenated , owing to evidence for recently accreted disks ( i.e. , the disks show disturbed or ring - like morphologies indicative of external accretion ) .",
    "it is important to note that the uv flux seen in etgs is not necessarily due to recent sf .",
    "an excess of uv flux seen in elliptical galaxies ( the `` uv upturn '' ) is believed to be caused by hot , evolved stars ( e.g. , horizontal branch stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the uv emission is expected to be smoothly distributed and follow the optical light profile of the galaxy .",
    "note , however , that uv upturn etgs are found in the uv - optical red sequence and not in the gv @xcite .",
    "agn activity can also contribute to the uv light seen in etgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our understanding of recent sf and rejuvenation in etgs has been drastically improved thanks to the large samples provided by sdss and galex .",
    "however , due to the limited spatial resolution of galex and the typical redshift of sdss galaxies ( @xmath0 ) , it has not been possible to resolve the actual physical location of the sf that is inferred based on integrated uv - optical colors . combining high - resolution uv imaging with the large sample sizes of all - sky surveys could provide important information about the nature and origin of recent sf in etgs .    as a follow - up to the sdss / galex studies mentioned above , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter sr2010 ) reported first results from high - resolution _ hst _  uv imaging of a sample of 29 sdss etgs detected by galex .",
    "these galaxies were chosen to have high sdss concentration and blue uv - optical colors , yet no detectable emission lines in the 3  sdss fiber spectra .",
    "this unique combination was intended to select centrally quiescent etgs yet with high uv excess .",
    "the emission line cut also had the effect of discarding etgs with emission lines due to agn activity , including most liners .",
    "sr2010  found that @xmath8 of their sample show _ extended _ uv emission in rings , clumps , and/or spiral arms due to ongoing or recent sf . in (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , these galaxies were named `` extended star - forming early - type galaxies '' ( esf - etgs ) , and we do the same in this work .",
    "the remaining @xmath9 of their sample had only small - scale sf or centrally compact uv emission . according to sr2010 ,",
    "the esf - etgs  on average have fairly low far - uv ( fuv ) dust attenuation and large uv sizes with respect to other galaxies with similar specific star formation rates .",
    "the large uv sizes and low fuv dust attenuation were consistent , they argued , with rejuvenated sf taking place in large outer reservoirs of gas acquired in mergers with gas - rich dwarfs or directly from the igm .",
    "however , fading of the original sf could not be ruled out in at least part of the esf - etg sample .",
    "a more comprehensive exploration of the same sample is presented in paper i , supplemented with deep , good - seeing @xmath10-band images taken with the wiyn telescope .",
    "the discussion there is focused on the qualitative morphologies of the esf - etgs  as determined from optical and uv images .",
    "galaxies were classified according to their optical hubble types as well as by their uv morphologies . some key conclusions from paper",
    "i are ( 1 ) the esf - etgs  have smooth optical morphologies without signatures of recent merger activity , ( 2 ) the origin of the gas is either internal or smoothly accreted from the igm , and ( 3 ) the extended sf phenomenon is preferentially found in s0s and not ellipticals .",
    "the intriguing results discussed in sr2010  and paper i call out for additional data and analysis to provide further insight into the nature of esf - etgs  in the gv .",
    "quantitative photometry from the optical and uv images can provide additional information about the stellar populations in the esf - etgs .",
    "in addition , a more careful comparison between the esf - etgs  and the sdss / galex parent population from which they were selected can help elucidate whether these objects are rare or common . to tackle these issues , we take advantage of the available uv and optical imaging to present a quantitative analysis of the star formation _ within _ each galaxy via aperture photometry and stellar population modeling .",
    "we show that the esf - etgs  have characteristically red centers containing old stars and blue outer disks due to recent sf , which is expected given how they were selected .",
    "the outer disks have a significant population of old stars as well , and we show that the colors are consistent with either the gradual decline of sf or rejuvenation occurring on extended timescales .",
    "in addition , we show that a sizable fraction of massive gv galaxies are potentially esf - etgs .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we describe the sr2010  sample of 29 etgs , sources of data , and data reduction in section [ data ] .",
    "section [ images ] presents optical and uv photometry of the sample , revealing similarities among the esf - etgs .",
    "an analysis of the stellar populations in the outer disks of the esf - etgs  is presented in section [ sps_ext ] .",
    "section [ sect_spec ] presents stacked sdss spectra of the bulges of the esf - etgs , revealing old central ages and hints of weak emission activity with liner - like ratios .",
    "we search for additional candidate esf - etgs  from a large sample of sdss galaxies and estimate the esf - etg contribution to the gv in section [ sect_gv ] .",
    "an examination of various possible scenarios to explain the sf in the esf - etgs  is given in section [ discussion ] .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper are on the ab system @xcite . a concordance @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "is assumed .",
    "descriptions of the sample selection criteria used in sr2010  as well as specifics about the uv and optical imaging are discussed in detail in paper i. briefly , a sample of 30 quiescent etgs with strong uv excess ( fuv@xmath14@xmath15 ) were selected from a cross - matched sdss dr4/galex ir1.1 catalog @xcite .",
    "high - resolution _ hst _  solar - blind channel fuv images were obtained for 29 objects . the numbering scheme used in paper i to identify these objects",
    "is retained in this paper , e.g. , sr01 is the first object in the sample .",
    "objects are ordered by increasing fuv@xmath14color .    as discussed in paper",
    "i , two objects ( sr22 and sr26 ) were removed from the analysis because of incorrect galex ir1.1 fuv magnitudes that resulted in erroneously blue fuv@xmath14colors .",
    "it was shown that the remaining galaxies divide nicely into three categories based on their uv morphology : extended sf ( uv rings and/or arms , 19 objects ) , small - scale sf ( 6 objects ) , and compact ( central uv source only , 2 objects ) . because the esf - etgs  represent the majority of the sample and",
    "may furthermore represent the behavior of many massive gv galaxies , we focus exclusively on them in the rest of this paper .      placing the esf - etgs  into the broader context of evolution through the gv",
    "requires a broad suite of ancillary data .",
    "in particular , we take advantage of additional structural and spectral data available from the sdss and galex databases . to make use of updated data since sr2010 , we used sdss dr7 @xcite and galex gr6 for both the esf - etgs  and a larger sdss sample .",
    "this larger sample was constructed using the sdss dr7/galex gr6 cross - matched catalog available through the galex casjobs interface .",
    "sdss galaxies with redshifts @xmath16 having a galex nuv and/or fuv detection in the medium imaging survey ( mis ) within a 5radius were selected .",
    "objects were excluded if they were more than 055 from the center of the galex detector to ensure reliable photometry .",
    "the resulting @xmath17 galaxies are referred to in this paper as the `` sdss master sample . '' in section [ sect_gv ] , we select galaxies from this sample and compare their properties with the 19 _ hst _ esf - etgs .    for both the esf - etgs  and the sdss master sample , integrated magnitudes in galex fuv , nuv , and sdss @xmath18",
    "were retrieved .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts , galactic extinction , optical petrosian radii ( enclosing 50% of the petrosian flux ) , isophotal axis ratios ( ` isob_r / isoa_r ` ) , and galex fwhm measurements ( a measure of uv diameter ) were also collected ; the galex resolution is @xmath19 fwhm .",
    "all integrated magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction and @xmath20-corrected to @xmath21 using the ` kcorrect ` code , version 4.2 @xcite . for reference ,",
    "the median @xmath20-correction for blue cloud ( red sequence ) galaxies is @xmath22fuv@xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the difference between observed and rest - frame color .",
    "stellar mass estimates and emission line measurements were obtained from the mpa / jhu value - added catalogs for sdss dr7 . table [ table_prop ] lists the various sdss and galex quantities described above for the esf - etgs .",

    "this figure demonstrates how cleanly fuv@xmath14separates the main galaxy population into well - defined blue and red sequences , with a clear gv in between .",
    "this is a major advantage of using a uv - optical color ; we can easily separate fully quenched objects from those that have only recently quenched .",
    "an optical color does not have the dynamic range to do this , which is why the optical red sequence appears more prominent .",
    "in other words , the red sequence in figure [ fuvr_mass ] appears less well - defined due to the `` resolving power '' of fuv@xmath14color . in addition the figure does not show a volume - limited sample , which reduces the number of low - mass , red objects in the plot .",
    "note that the esf - etgs  are located among the higher - mass galaxies in the gv ( and blue sequence ) .",
    "aperture photometry of the uv images was measured using source extractor , version 2.8.6 @xcite . to be consistent with the sdss optical measurements ,",
    "uv fluxes were measured using the circular apertures defined by the sdss ` frames ` pipeline .",
    "the radii of the apertures used are @xmath45 .",
    "while elliptical apertures are better suited for this particular sample , we show below that the typical color profile in the outer parts of the galaxies is fairly flat , and thus our measurements are not that sensitive to the exact shape of the aperture . to check this ,",
    "we compared the sdss @xmath46-band surface brightness profiles to those measured in elliptical apertures from deeper @xmath10-band images taken with the wiyn telescope ( presented in paper i ) ; no significant difference was found between the shapes of the sdss and wiyn profiles .",
    "the wiyn data are not used here because they exist for only 16 of the 19 esf - etgs  and because they have not been flux - calibrated . to avoid spurious color gradients ,",
    "the _ hst _  uv images were first smoothed to match the 14 seeing ( 1@xmath47 ) of the sdss telescope . in a few cases ( sr08 and sr17 ) nearby uv companions located within the outermost aperture were masked out prior to measuring photometry .",
    "the uv sky background in each individual frame was determined by measuring fluxes in a number of @xmath48-pixel boxes placed in source - free regions of the image .",
    "the average value of all the box fluxes was taken to be the sky value and was subtracted from each individual frame prior to co - adding them ( paper i ) .",
    "the sky is not uniform across the image , and this represents an additional source of uncertainty in the photometry .",
    "we accounted for this by measuring the rms scatter of the residual sky values in the co - added frames , defined to be the standard deviation of the distribution of box fluxes in source - free regions .",
    "the total error in each aperture flux measurement consists of poisson noise of the source and sky and the rms scatter in the residual sky , all added in quadrature .",
    "note that the sbc detector has no read noise .",
    "flux errors in the optical photometry are small ( a few percent at most ) , and the errors on the colors are dominated by the uv measurements .    to check for any zeropoint offset between the galex fuv and _ hst _  fuv filters , we compared integrated magnitudes measured from the _ hst _",
    "images to the galex gr6 `` mag_auto '' magnitudes .",
    "as seen in figure [ total_mag ] , the agreement between the two measurements is generally good , with a median offset of hst@xmath49galex @xmath50 mag .",
    "since the offset is much smaller than the fuv@xmath14colors , no correction was made to the _ hst _  magnitudes .",
    "note that the magnitudes in figure [ total_mag ] have not been corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "to give an idea of the uv morphologies seen in the esf - etgs , figure [ plot_images ] presents a montage of four esf - etgs  in the sample .",
    "as discussed in paper i , uv rings are seen in all but one of the esf - etgs , and clear spiral arms are found in two objects .",
    "crucially , the uv emission is _ extended _ over tens of kpc in all cases .",
    "compact , central uv emission is also seen in nearly all the esf - etgs .",
    "the reader is referred to paper i for a compilation and discussion of the uv and optical images and morphologies of the complete sample .",
    "new in this paper are the sdss @xmath46-band and _ hst _  uv surface brightness and color profiles , presented in figure [ plot_prof ] .",
    "surface brightness measurements are also listed in table [ table_sb ] for reference ( negative fluxes are arbitrarily assigned a surface brightness of 35 mag arcsec@xmath51 ) . since the surface brightness values are averages within each annulus , each point has been plotted at the midpoint of each annulus . to facilitate comparison between galaxies ,",
    "the radial coordinate has been scaled to the petrosian half - light radius ( @xmath52 ) for each galaxy .",
    "the photometry quantitatively highlights the disconnect between optical and uv light in tracing young stars and underscores the leverage one gains with uv data when studying recent sf in etgs .",

    "all three of these tracks include the two - component dust model of @xcite .",

    ", we first discuss the behavior of the models themselves .",
    "the @xmath365-models represent gradually declining sf and are meant to represent the gradual decline of sf expected in massive blue galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as figure [ models ] shows , at a fixed age , a longer @xmath373 results in bluer colors .",
    "this is because the sf rate at a given age is higher in longer @xmath373 models , and thus the colors `` hover '' at bluer values for longer than a model with shorter @xmath373 .",
    "overall , the @xmath365-models span about 7 gyr in age for the esf - etg color range plotted in figure [ models ] .",
    "the double-@xmath365 track is identical to the @xmath367 gyr track up to @xmath374 gyr , when the second episode of sf begins .",
    "the colors then become bluer before looping back and approaching the original @xmath367 gyr track .",
    "in other words , the double-@xmath365 model is virtually indistinguishable from the single-@xmath365 model @xmath375 gyr after the second sf episode begins .",
    "by contrast , the behavior of the two - burst model is rather different and simulates the effect of rapidly rejuvenated sf in a quiescent galaxy .",
    "the second burst occurs on top of an evolved stellar population , and thus affects the fuv@xmath363 color ( which is sensitive to young stars ) more strongly than the @xmath364 color ( which is dominated by older stars ) .",
    "this causes the track to rapidly redden in fuv@xmath363 as the ob stars die off while the optical @xmath364 color changes little .",
    "as seen in the figure , the fuv@xmath363 color reddens within @xmath376 myr , implying that any significant bluing in the uv due to bursty sf would have to be short - lived .",
    "what do the models tell us about the stellar populations in the outer disks of the esf - etgs ?",
    "as seen in figure [ models](a ) , the outer esf - etg colors are generally consistent with the declining @xmath365-models ( both single-@xmath365 and double-@xmath365 ) and imply intermediate to old ages for the underlying stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "by contrast , the two - burst model colors are somewhat offset from the mean @xmath364 colors of the esf - etgs .",
    "one could argue that adjusting the mass fraction of the second burst ( set to 2% in the figure ) or incorporating dust reddening could bring the colors more in agreement .",
    "however , regardless of the values used , bursts evolve _ very quickly _ through the region occupied by the esf - etgs , and thus it is statistically unlikely that most esf - etgs  are bursts unless they are exceedingly rare objects .",
    "we return to this issue in section [ sect_gv ] and show that this is probably not the case .",
    "collectively , this comparison shows that the sf in the outer disks of the esf - etgs  is taking place _ in regions with old stars_. moreover , it demonstrates that _ bursty _ rejuvenation is not likely responsible for the sf we see .",
    "this last point is consistent with sr2010 s selection against galaxies with post - starburst signatures or optical disturbances indicative of recent , short - duration bursts .",
    "in addition to the model comparison above , it is useful to demonstrate the existence of old stellar populations in the esf - etg disks in an empirical manner . to that end",
    ", we now compare the outer disk colors of the esf - etgs  to two sets of galaxies chosen from the sdss master sample .",
    "these sets are indicated by the rectangles in figure [ fuvr_mass ] .",
    "the comparison sample in figure [ models](a ) consists of high - mass ( @xmath377 ) galaxies matched in redshift to the esf - etgs  ( @xmath378 ) that have the same _ integrated _ fuv@xmath14color as the _",
    "outer _ parts of the esf - etgs , namely @xmath379 fuv@xmath14@xmath380 , i.e. , they reside in the blue cloud .",
    "the integrated colors of these galaxies have been corrected for galactic extinction but are not @xmath20-corrected .",
    "we note that the @xmath20-correction to @xmath372 is small , i.e. , @xmath381 mag for fuv@xmath363 and @xmath382 mag for @xmath364 .",
    "as can be seen , the outer esf - etg colors are fully consistent with the integrated colors of these comparison galaxies .",
    "because the latter are massive , they have significant old stellar populations , and hence red @xmath364 colors ( the effect of dust attenuation is discussed below ) .",
    "this bolsters the conclusion from comparing to models above that old stars are present in the outer disks of the esf - etgs .",
    "by contrast , the sample in figure [ models](b ) is comprised of low - mass ( @xmath383 ) blue cloud galaxies within the same redshift range as the esf - etgs  ( @xmath378 ) .",
    "their @xmath364 colors seem systematically too blue compared to the esf - etgs , reflecting the fact that they have higher specific sf rates than their more massive counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a higher fraction of younger , and hence bluer , stars in the low - mass objects , driving their @xmath364 color blueward .",
    "indeed , visual inspection of the sdss color images of the low- and high - mass comparison galaxies clearly shows that the former have blue disks , while the latter have red bulges and disks .",
    "the point is that the integrated colors of more massive , optically redder comparison galaxies are a good match to the outer colors of the esf - etgs  whereas the less massive , optically bluer comparison sample does not match .",
    "thus we have seen that both data and theory lead to the same conclusion : old stars are abundant in the outer star - forming regions of the esf - etgs .",
    "our discussion so far has neglected the effects of dust attenuation on the observed colors of the comparison galaxies .",
    "indeed , the amount of dust attenuation in sf galaxies increases with stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , potentially complicating our comparison with the esf - etgs , especially for the massive sample shown in figure [ models](a ) .",
    "we attempted to remove the most dust - reddened objects by excluding edge - on systems with axis ratio @xmath384 .",
    "this makes no difference in the distribution of points in figure [ models ] . in any case , assuming that the dust - corrected colors of the comparison galaxies are bluer than shown in figure [ models ] only strengthens our conclusion that the outer disks of the esf - etgs  contain _ old _ stars .",
    "the sdss fiber spectra , which probe the central 3  ( @xmath385 kpc at @xmath0 ) , can provide additional insight into the stellar populations and any potential emission activity that may be responsible for the central uv light seen in nearly all the esf - etgs .",
    "also , they can inform our discussion about how sf is evolving in the esf - etgs , particularly the possible role of agn feedback in shutting down sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sr2010  tentatively ascribed the central uv emission to weak agn activity based on a stacked bpt classification .",
    "stacking was necessary because the esf - etgs  do not have securely detected emission lines , meaning any ( potentially weak ) emission features will not be readily apparent in the individual spectra .",
    "we reach similar conclusions based on stacking the spectra themselves .",
    "the stacking method is detailed in @xcite .",
    "figure [ ext_spec ] shows the resulting stacked spectrum of the esf - etgs .",
    "interestingly , weak emission lines due to [ ] @xmath386 and [ ] @xmath387 that were not apparent in the individual spectra are clearly evident in the stack .",
    "these emission lines are characteristic of liner emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if liners are indeed a weak phase in the agn life cycle , this might indicate that agn feedback played a role in shutting down sf , at least in the centers of these galaxies .",
    "however , agn feedback has historically been proposed as a mechanism that quenches sf _ globally _ in a galaxy , not just in the center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the extended sf seen in the outer parts of the esf - etgs , it would appear that agn feedback is most effective at removing ( or heating up ) the _ central _ gas and less so at disrupting sf in the outer parts .",
    "interestingly , recent observations of x - ray - selected agn hosts at @xmath388 may suggest that agn feedback quenches sf only within the central kpc @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the liner emission observed in esf - etgs  is unrelated to agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been suggested that liner emission is dominated by emission from hot gas in the ism ionized by extended uv sources , such as post - agb stars , rather than an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    ", the emission in the stacked spectrum is both weak and uncharacteristic of young stars , which is the point we wish to establish .",
    "with our resolved photometry we are able to say more about the nature of the central uv emission in the esf - etgs .",
    "the central fuv@xmath14colors of the esf - etgs  ( fuv@xmath14@xmath389 ) in figure [ plot_prof ] are consistent with old , red sequence galaxies ( figure [ fuvr_mass ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility that liner emission is due to ionization by old , uv - bright ( e.g. , post - agb ) stars bolsters the observation that the central uv emission is not due to recent sf . to summarize ,",
    "the stacked spectra indicate weak liner - like activity , but the red fuv@xmath14colors do not require anything besides old uv upturn stars .    with spectra",
    "one can also compute mean ages of the central stellar populations from absorption features . to gain quantitative insight into the typical age of the stars in the central regions of the esf - etgs , the publicly available code",
    "` ez_ages ` @xcite was used to compute a mean luminosity - weighted age from the stacked spectrum .",
    "stellar absorption templates are fit to the spectrum , and an age is derived based on the calculated strength of age - sensitive absorption features , such as h@xmath390 .",
    "caution must be taken to account for any absorption line infill due to nearby emission .",
    "the h@xmath390 absorption line strength measured here was corrected for infill by first determining the ew of the [ ] emission [ visible only in the continuum - subtracted spectrum ( not shown ) ] , then calculating the appropriate h@xmath390 correction using equation ( a1 ) of appendix a in @xcite .",
    "the correction was subtracted from the h@xmath390 line strengths before estimating ages .",
    "the resulting mean luminosity - weighted age ( determined using primarily h@xmath390 and @xmath391fe@xmath392 ) of the central regions of the esf - etgs  is @xmath393  gyr .",
    "this derived age is younger than a pure , maximally old passively evolving stellar population , but it is consistent with light - weighted ages of the central regions of other etgs in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , an age of @xmath394 gyr is not consistent with any significant contribution from young stars .",
    "for example , the sauron galaxies with recently formed young stellar populations have h@xmath390-based light - weighted ages younger than @xmath395 gyr @xcite .      with their characteristic blue outer colors and distinctive uv rings ,",
    "the esf - etgs  represent a clearly identifiable stage of evolution of massive etgs through the gv . while the uv properties of only a small number of esf - etgs  have been presented in this work ,",
    "it is useful , if possible , to place our results in the broader context of evolution through the gv .",
    "to do so requires answering two questions .",
    "first , are esf - etgs  rare or common among the gv population ?",
    "second , what is the `` residence time '' of esf - etgs  in the gv ?",
    "the answer to the first question can help establish whether or not extended sf is a dominant phenomenon among gv galaxies . answering the second question can help distinguish between plausible sf histories of the esf - etgs , such as those discussed in section [ sps_ext ] .",
    "accordingly , in this section a search is conducted for further potential esf - etg candidates in the sdss master sample defined in section [ sect_ancillary ] .",
    "we first review the selection cuts made by sr2010  in defining their _ hst _  sample and explain the motivations behind them .",
    "then we apply a modified version of the sr2010  cuts on the sdss master sample and examine the properties of the resulting objects , many hundreds of which we also believe to be esf - etgs .",
    "sources of contamination that need to be accounted for when counting gv galaxies are discussed , and a rough estimate of the fraction of esf - etgs  in the gv is presented .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the esf - etg gv residence time and its use in constraining potential sf histories for the esf - etgs .      at first blush",
    ", the small number of galaxies selected by sr2010  would seem to suggest that esf - etgs  comprise an insignificant part of the gv . in the following sections we show that this is not the case . recall that sr2010  selected an initial sample of @xmath396 objects with strong uv excess and no spectral signatures of sf or agn activity starting with a cross - matched sdss dr4/galex ir1.1 catalog @xcite containing 18,127 galaxies located within 055 of the center of the galex field of view .",
    "the catalog sky coverage is 645 deg@xmath397 .",
    "the second column of table [ counts ] shows the number of galaxies we obtain from the same catalog that satisfy each successive sr2010  cut , until the final sample is obtained . to review , the first cut made by sr2010  selected for etgs by choosing galaxies with @xmath46-band concentration @xmath398 .",
    "to exclude objects with emission due to sf or agn , only galaxies in the `` unclassifiable '' category as defined by @xcite were kept ( these are galaxies with generally weak emission ) . to further prune remaining galaxies with weak emission , sr2010  required h@xmath390 s / n @xmath399 and excluded any galaxies located within the liner region of the bpt diagram , i.e. , @xmath400([]/h@xmath401 ) @xmath402 and @xmath403([]/h@xmath390 ) @xmath404 , regardless of line s / n .",
    "finally , a color cut was made to select galaxies with strong uv excess ( fuv@xmath14@xmath15 ) . as can be seen in the second column of table",
    "[ counts ] , their very small final sample is due mainly to the cuts on `` unclassifiable '' galaxies and fuv@xmath14color .",
    "we note that among these @xmath396 objects are galaxies with clear optical disturbances , late - type morphologies and post - starburst signatures .",
    "to arrive at their final sample of 30 objects , sr2010 excluded these contaminants .",

    "it should be noted that the original goal of sr2010 s selection strategy was to study objects with unusually strong uv excess that was not obviously related to sf or agn activity .",
    "therefore , they purposely imposed very strict criteria on spectroscopic quiescence to reduce possible uv contamination from sf or agn .",
    "their selection criteria were not designed to obtain a _",
    "complete _ sample of esf - etgs . to achieve that we modify some of their criteria below .",
    "the hallmark of esf - etgs  is that they are characterized by extended sf in their outer parts , while their centers are devoid of sf . nevertheless ,",
    "as demonstrated in section [ sect_spec ] , their central regions may harbor weak emission consistent with liners .",
    "regardless of the source of the liner emission ( section [ sect_spec ] ) , such emission may be a common feature of esf - etgs  and may hold clues to their evolution through the gv .",
    "thus a search for esf - etgs  ought not to exclude _ a priori _ galaxies with weak ( liner ) emission since such emission unlikely affects the uv flux ( section [ sect_spec ] ) . because sr2010  explicitly excluded galaxies with _ any _ central emission , their exclusion of liners probably also excluded many genuine non - star - forming galaxies . in what follows",
    ", we relax the sr2010  selection criteria to accept liners , and thereby demonstrate that a larger sample of esf - candidates exists and that such a sample indeed shares many similarities with the esf - etgs  observed by _",
    "hst_.    in selecting our new `` esf - candidate sample '' , the most salient sr2010  selection criteria were retained , namely , the morphological cut ( concentration @xmath398 ) and the fuv@xmath14color cut ( fuv@xmath14@xmath15 ) .",
    "however , we avoided selecting galaxies based on the spectral categories defined by @xcite , which relied on s / n cuts and bpt classification .",
    "instead , weak central - star - forming galaxies were chosen based on h@xmath401equivalent width ( ew ) . because the ew",
    "measures the continuum - normalized line strength , it can be used to compare the emission properties in galaxies with different intrinsic luminosities in a relatively uniform manner .",
    "since we are interested in selecting ( bright ) galaxies with weak h@xmath401emission , the ew provides a cleaner indicator of h@xmath401line strength than a s / n cut on the emission line flux .    shown in figure [ haew_fuvr](a )",
    "is the fuv@xmath14 vs.  h@xmath401ew distribution of the sdss master sample , with the esf - etgs  overplotted .",
    "we see that the esf - etgs  lie within ( or below ) the gv in fuv@xmath14(by selection ) and also have low h@xmath401ews for their fuv@xmath14color .",
    "the low ews are consistent with sr2010 s selection against detectable emission lines using s / n cuts .",
    "the maximum h@xmath401ew among the esf - etgs  is approximately log h@xmath401ew [  ] @xmath408 , and we adopt this as the upper boundary for the esf - candidates . thus our final sample of new esf - candidate galaxies satisfies the following criteria : ( 1 ) fuv@xmath14@xmath15 , ( 2 ) @xmath409-band concentration - band concentration .",

    "moreover , like the esf - etgs , the esf - candidate galaxies lie on the optical red sequence despite their blue fuv@xmath14colors .",
    "table [ mycounts ] lists the number of galaxies remaining after each of the new selection cuts . evidently including galaxies with weak emission yields many more galaxies .",

    "esf - candidates classified as liners according to @xcite are plotted as green dots .",
    "three things to note are : ( 1 ) the new esf - candidate sample has a similar distribution as the esf - etgs , ( 2 ) the liners make up a significant fraction of the esf - candidate sample ( @xmath411 ) , and ( 3 ) most of the original esf - etgs  have h@xmath401ews comparable to the liners . point ( 1 ) is simply due to selecting galaxies with similar color and ews as the esf - etgs . point ( 2 ) suggests that many of the esf - candidates have weak emission that in the stronger cases has been classified as liners . point ( 3 ) is consistent with the results of section [ sect_spec ] , where liner emission lines , including h@xmath401 , were detected in the stacked spectrum of the esf - etgs .",
    "if one assumes that liner activity is common in aging stellar populations , then it is reassuring to find that a significant fraction of the esf - candidate sample are liners .",
    "moreover , it is of interest to see whether the liner galaxies have other properties in common with the esf - etgs .    a notable characteristic of the esf - etgs  is their large uv sizes ( sr2010 ) .",
    "this is important because it may be a clue to the origin of the gas fueling the extended sf .",
    "sr2010  showed that the galex fuv fwhm sizes of the esf - etgs  ( roughly their uv diameters ) tend to be larger than other gv galaxies with similar specific sf rates ( their figure 5 ) .",
    "we obtain a similar result in figure [ fuvr_fuvsize](a ) , where the distribution of fuv fwhm vs.  fuv@xmath14color is plotted in a similar style as figure [ haew_fuvr ] .",
    "figure [ fuvr_fuvsize](a ) shows the esf - etgs  compared to the full sdss master sample .",
    "clearly , the esf - etgs  are systematically larger than the average of _ all other gv galaxies of similar fuv@xmath14color_.    since we aim to establish the similarity between the true esf - etgs  and the esf - candidates , we proceed to compare the uv sizes of the esf - etgs  with the esf - candidates .",
    "we refrain from making comparisons with the rest of the gv .",
    "figure [ fuvr_fuvsize](b ) shows the uv sizes of the esf - etgs  and esf - candidates .",
    "since the latter were chosen in a similar way as the esf - etgs , it is not too surprising that their uv sizes are roughly consistent with those of the esf - etgs .",
    "the higher - h@xmath401galaxies in the gv prove to have smaller uv sizes , and agreement with the esf - etg sample is improved when they are eliminated .",
    "to quantify any remaining offset between the esf - candidates and the esf - etgs , a linear fit was made to the esf - candidate sample and the residuals in fuv fwhm of the esf - etgs  were computed . the median fuv fwhm residual for the esf - etgs  is @xmath412 dex .",
    "this implies that the esf - etgs  are @xmath413 larger than the esf - candidate galaxies .",
    "this slightly larger size may be because the esf - etgs  were chosen to satisfy strict criteria that may have biased the sample to larger uv sizes , whereas the esf - candidate sample has not been vetted in a similarly stringent manner .",
    "in particular , sr2010 excluded post - starburst galaxies and other blue interlopers , which tend to have smaller uv sizes .",
    "we also note that the liners in figure [ fuvr_fuvsize](b ) are not systematically larger or smaller than the esf - candidates or the esf - etgs .",
    "this similarity between the esf - etgs  and liners reinforces our assertion that many of the liner galaxies have large uv diameters consistent with the esf - etgs , and that a larger population of gv galaxies with extended uv emission exists .",
    "an additional comparison is made in figure [ mass_fuvsize ] , where we show the distribution of fuv size as a function of stellar mass .",
    "figure [ mass_fuvsize](a ) shows the sdss master sample , while figure [ mass_fuvsize](b ) plots only the esf - candidate sample .",
    "a strong trend is apparent in both panels , with more massive galaxies having larger uv diameters .",
    "notably , the esf - etgs  are consistent with this trend .",
    "the median fuv fwhm residual of the esf - etgs  from a linear fit to the esf - candidate sample is now only @xmath414 dex , i.e. , at fixed stellar mass , the esf - etgs  are @xmath415 larger .",
    "this median uv size residual is _ smaller _ than in the previous comparison in figure [ fuvr_fuvsize](b ) , which did not take into account the strong trend with stellar mass .",
    "again , the existence of liner galaxies with similarly large uv sizes strengthens our point that such uv - extended galaxies comprise a non - negligible fraction of massive gv etgs ( see below ) .    to summarize",
    ", we conclude that the stellar masses and uv sizes of the 19 _ hst _ esf - etgs  are consistent with a much larger sample of esf - candidate objects .",
    "this analysis lends support to our claim that the esf - etgs  are only a small subset of a larger population of galaxies with similar properties .      investigating a sample with weak or marginally detected properties is always challenging because of the inherent inhomogeneities present within it due to measurement error or misidentification .",
    "the esf - candidate sample is no exception , and properly screening its members is necessary to obtain useful results .",
    "indeed , prior to formulating their final _ hst _  program , sr2010  visually inspected their @xmath396 candidate objects for possible contamination due to nearby companions , tidal disturbances , or post - starburst galaxies and wound up discarding half of them on these accounts .",
    "we repeated this exercise on their @xmath396 objects and found 20 contaminants , or @xmath416 of the sample .",
    "most of the contamination is due to nearby uv - bright objects that in some cases induce a large ( @xmath417 ) offset between the sdss and galex positions .",
    "five contaminants have post - starburst spectra and appear rather blue in optical color ; these were eliminated by sr2010  because their uv emission is obviously due to sf .",
    "in addition to the 1/3 of the sample excluded by our new visual inspections , _ hst _  uv imaging revealed that about 1/3 of the actually imaged galaxies had uv morphologies unlike the esf - etgs ; their uv emission is either compact or on small scales ( section [ data ] and paper i ) . taken together , these cuts imply that almost half of the galaxies in the initial sample of @xmath396 are not bona fide esf - etgs . assuming that this fraction is representative of the larger esf - candidate sample , the estimated number of true esf - etgs  is reduced from @xmath418 to @xmath419 .",
    "a key question is whether the esf - candidate sample represents the typical galaxy evolving through the gv .",
    "however , determining this requires some care .",
    "because the esf - etgs  and the esf - candidates have high stellar masses ( @xmath420 ) , we can only make statements about the _ massive _ end of the gv .",
    "we define the massive end of the gv in fuv@xmath14color - mass space to be bounded by @xmath421 fuv@xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath422 .",
    "this mass range spans most of the esf - etgs  and contains @xmath423 galaxies in the sdss master sample . to avoid potential contamination due to dust - reddened , star - forming galaxies",
    ", we further exclude highly inclined galaxies with axis ratio @xmath424 .",
    "this is a significant cut that removes @xmath425 galaxies .",
    "this cut is motivated by the observation that nearly all of the esf - etgs  tend to be nearly face - on , with @xmath426 ( table [ table_prop ] ) . to be consistent with the cuts made to identify massive gv galaxies",
    ", we cut the esf - candidate sample to have the same range in stellar mass , fuv@xmath14color , and axis ratio .",
    "this results in @xmath427 galaxies , and implies that the relative fraction of esf - candidates among massive gv galaxies in this uv color - mass bin is @xmath428 .",
    "exact numbers are presented in table [ gvcounts ] for reference .",
    "note that this quoted fraction has not been corrected for contamination by superposed companions , post - starburst galaxies , etc .",
    ", as discussed above .",
    "if such contamination is random , then the resulting fraction remains unchanged .",
    "however , if some forms of contamination affect the esf - candidate sample more than the general gv population , then the fraction can be smaller .",
    "for example , post - starburst galaxies ought to be excluded from the esf - candidates but not the general gv because they are truly transitioning from blue to red but are not esf - etgs .",
    "we have attempted to estimate this `` differential contamination '' by applying cuts to the esf - candidate sample that mimic the results of the visual inspection described earlier .",
    "specifically , contaminants are excluded if they satisfy any of the following conditions : ( 1 ) h@xmath429 to remove post - starbursts , ( 2 ) fuv - to - optical size ratio @xmath430 to remove galaxies without extended sf , or ( 3 ) galex - sdss separation @xmath431 to remove obvious superpositions . applying these cuts lowers the esf - candidate fraction to @xmath1 , i.e. , contamination may reduce the fraction by @xmath432 .",
    "lc    initial sample & 31763 ( 100% ) + massive gv & 5199 ( 16.4% ) + face - on ( @xmath433 ) & 3389 ( 10.7% ) + esf - candidates & 670 ( 2.1% )    by defining a suitable esf - candidate sample , we have shown that many other objects exist with similar properties ( fuv@xmath14color , h@xmath401ew , stellar mass , and uv size ) to the original esf - etgs . within these selection cuts ,",
    "esf - candidates classified as liners have similar properties as well .",
    "this bolsters our belief that esf - etgs  are accompanied by weak liner - like emission .",
    "we have therefore shown that the 19 esf - etgs  studied in this paper are part of a larger population of similar galaxies . moreover , we have shown that extended sf in etgs is not a rare phenomenon among massive gv galaxies .      in the previous section we showed that a modest fraction ( @xmath434 ) of massive gv galaxies are likely to be esf - etgs . however , this by itself does not constrain the star formation _",
    "timescale _ of the esf - etgs .",
    "this quantity is important as it will be used later to identify plausible sf histories for the esf - etgs , in particular focusing on the recent sf traced by the uv . in this section",
    "we estimate the contribution of rapid , bursty sf as triggered by a minor merger to the fraction of etgs in the gv .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to determine if such bursty sf is sufficient to explain the abundance of esf - candidates in the gv identified in the previous section .",
    "the expected number of etgs found in the gv due to minor - merger - driven sf is calculated as follows .",
    "we assume the progenitors are etgs in the uv - optical red sequence ( fuv@xmath14@xmath435 ) or not detected at all in fuv .",
    "this color cut is made on the assumption that esf - etg progenitors were initially quiescent and not star - forming and that the subsequent , rejuvenated sf moved them back into the gv .",
    "the progenitors are restricted to galaxies with ( 1 ) @xmath422 , ( 2 ) concentration @xmath398 , and ( 3 ) axis ratio @xmath426 .",
    "these cuts are made to be consistent with the esf - candidates , which are the presumed descendants .",
    "this gives 11875 galaxies .",
    "the minor merger rate is estimated using the theoretical predictions given in @xcite . specifically , a minor merger rate of 0.03 @xmath436 ( 1:10 mass ratio ) is assumed .",
    "in addition we estimate the time spent in the gv due to enhanced sf to be @xmath437 myr .",
    "this estimate assumes three pericentric passages of the satellite , each causing an enhancement of the sf rate ( and bluer fuv@xmath14colors ) lasting for @xmath438 myr @xcite .",
    "note that the final coalescence is not included in this estimate because the resulting sf is expected to be centrally concentrated and hence unlike the sf seen in the esf - etgs . combining these values",
    ", we estimate @xmath439 etgs to be present in the gv due to ( ring - like ) minor - merger - driven sf . compared with the 670 esf - candidates identified in the previous section",
    ", we see that bursty sf resulting from minor mergers can only account for @xmath440 of esf - candidates .",
    "it is interesting to note that this fraction is not too different from the @xmath2 differential contamination presented in the previous section . in other words ,",
    "the contaminating galaxies are quite possibly a subset of the minor - merger - driven sf galaxies .",
    "note that the above discussion is meant to constrain the role of bursty _ star formation _",
    "due to minor mergers ; we are not requiring that the _ gas _ fueling the observed sf can not have come from minor mergers .",
    "it should be noted that the 40% estimate is subject to uncertainties in both the merger rate and gv residence time . in particular , ( minor ) merger rates are uncertain at the factor of @xmath441 level at least ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the gv residence time is sensitive to the duration of each burst of sf and the number of passages , which depend on the merger geometry , mass ratio , etc .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult to quantify such uncertainties , and the 40% contribution estimated above should be viewed as a rough estimate at best .",
    "thus we tentatively suggest that bursty sf is unlikely to be the dominant cause of the sf in the esf - etgs , though it can not be firmly ruled out by this analysis . however , section [ discussion ] below highlights other evidence that indicates that the sf in the majority of esf - etgs  is likely due to more gradual processes .",
    "given the photometric and spectroscopic results presented for the esf - etgs , along with the selection and examination of the esf - candidates , we are now in a stronger position to interpret the recent sf observed in the esf - etgs .",
    "the main question motivating this study is whether the esf - etgs  are fading out or are rejuvenated .",
    "this question is directly tied to how these galaxies are evolving through the gv . to provide a framework for discussion ,",
    "we present three possible evolutionary scenarios to explain the sf in the esf - etgs : ( 1 ) rapid quenching , ( 2 ) disk rejuvenation ( sf in a pre - existing disk ) , and ( 3 ) gradual decline .",
    "we evaluate the plausibility of each scenario in light of the results in this paper and paper i. the present discussion supplements the close examination in paper i of the origin of the gas fueling the extended sf in the esf - etgs .    _",
    "( 1 ) rapid quenching .",
    "_ in this scenario , sf is quickly truncated as a result of a ( gas - rich ) major merger that triggers a rapid starburst and/or agn .",
    "centrally concentrated sf is expected to occur in galaxies undergoing such an event due to the funneling of gas toward the center during the merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas can also power an agn that ejects any remaining gas out of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the timescale for sf is expected to be short ( a few 100 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , owing to the strong agn feedback that effectively quenches any remaining sf .",
    "the resulting remnant is predicted to have spheroidal morphology .",
    "note that this scenario applies equally well to a galaxy that is moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence for the first time or has been rejuvenated back into the gv .    though it is possible that the esf - etgs  have undergone rapid quenching in the past , the _ recent _ sf observed is unlikely to be related to the end phase of such an event .",
    "their optical morphologies , while bulge - dominated , include a disk component , are undisturbed , and do not reveal any signs of recent mergers or interactions with nearby companions ( sr17 is an exception ; paper i ) .",
    "in addition , we find that the stellar populations at the centers of the esf - etgs  are uniformly old , arguing against centrally concentrated recent sf . there does exist evidence for rapid quenching of sf via major mergers in certain kinds of galaxies , notably post - starburst galaxies .",
    "however , the spectra of such objects show signatures of a few 100-myr old stellar population superimposed on old stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and many are morphologically disturbed . in contrast , none of the sdss spectra of the esf - etgs  displays the strong balmer lines characteristic of post - starbursts , as expected from how they were selected .",
    "we note that only five of the original 60 sr2010  candidates were excluded because they appeared to be post - starbursts based on their large h@xmath442 values ; these may be the post - major merger objects .",
    "the lack of central sf in the esf - etgs  is not too surprising given the sr2010  selection criteria , which selected galaxies without detectable emission in the centers yet had blue fuv@xmath14colors .",
    "this unique combination of parameters is thus a useful method of finding gv galaxies dominated by _ extended _ uv emission .",
    "based on their undisturbed morphologies and lack of centrally concentrated sf , we conclude that the esf - etgs  have not experienced recent rapid quenching and that their sf is the result of some other , less violent process .",
    "we are not implying , however , that such a scenario is impossible for at least some gv galaxies .",
    "rapid quenching is seriously considered as the main channel for some galaxies to evolve onto the red sequence @xcite .",
    "_ ( 2 ) disk rejuvenation .",
    "_ in this scenario recent sf takes place in an _ existing _ ( formerly quiescent ) stellar disk , such as those found in s0 galaxies .",
    "the newly formed stars cause the fuv@xmath14color to become bluer .",
    "because the new young stars form on top of the existing old stellar population , galaxies undergoing disk rejuvenation would be expected to have similar colors to the outer colors seen in the esf - etgs  in our sample .",
    "in the nearby universe , this phenomenon is exemplified by the discovery of extended - uv ( xuv ) disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "xuv - disk galaxies are characterized by extended uv emission located beyond the sf threshold . in most cases",
    ", this translates to sf being located beyond the optical extent of the galaxy , though in some objects the xuv emission is found _ within _ the optical extent .",
    "xuv - disks have been found in galaxies of all hubble types , notably even in e / s0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus it is possible that the esf - etgs  are examples of early - type xuv - disks , especially since their sf occurs primarily in the outskirts of the optical disks ( figure [ plot_prof ] ; paper i ) .",
    "@xcite adopted a threshold uv surface brightness of @xmath443 ab mag arcsec@xmath51 to characterize xuv disks , which corresponds to a threshold sf surface density of @xmath444 . according to that criterion",
    ", our esf - etg uv disks hover near that level , as may be seen in figure [ plot_prof ] , thus qualifying them as xuv disks or very near that level .",
    "indeed , a study of the space density of xuv - disk galaxies by @xcite has shown that xuv - disks are more common among red sequence and gv galaxies . in one respect , however , our galaxies differ strongly in that their outer fuv@xmath14colors are a full 1.5 - 2.5 mag bluer than their integrated fuv@xmath14colors . in @xcite , by contrast , outer fuv@xmath14colors correlate closely with integrated fuv@xmath14colors , and there are no blue outer disks at all among their red galaxies ( their figure 12 ) .",
    "thus , it is not clear that they are detecting the same phenomenon that we are .",
    "different mechanisms can deliver gas into the outer regions of a galaxy and trigger disk rejuvenation .",
    "@xcite proposed that cold gas accretion from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is responsible for triggering sf in the xuv - disks .",
    "this picture is a possible manifestation of late - time cold mode accretion predicted in simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition , minor , gas - rich mergers can also trigger recent sf in etgs @xcite , perhaps leading to disk rejuvenation in addition to nuclear sf .",
    "disk rejuvenation may be a viable explanation for the sf seen in at least some of the esf - etgs .",
    "all the esf - etgs  in the sample are classified as s0 or later ( paper i ) , so the presence of extended uv emission is not unreasonable given the literature results discussed above . as discussed in section [ sps_ext ] , the outer disks of the esf - etgs  contain a significant underlying old stellar population upon which new stars have formed .",
    "however , any disk rejuvenation can not have been triggered recently or very rapidly .",
    "for one thing , the highly symmetric uv morphologies of the esf - etgs  would require any gas to be resident in the galaxies for a few rotation periods , which in the outer parts is likely to exceed @xmath375 gyr .",
    "igm accretion is consistent with this picture as long as it occurs smoothly on extended timescales , allowing the gas to settle into an axisymmetric disk before forming stars .",
    "in addition , as figure [ models ] indicates , a burst superimposed on an old stellar population reddens too quickly .",
    "we roughly estimated in section [ gvtime ] that bursty sf due to minor mergers produces less than half the number of esf - candidates identified in the gv ( section [ contamination ] ) , tentatively suggesting that minor mergers are not the dominant cause of the sf in the esf - etgs .",
    "moreover , the sf histories predicted from minor merger simulations are bursty with typical timescales of a few to several 100 myr @xcite .",
    "also , the newly formed stars tend to be centrally concentrated @xcite , in contrast with the red colors seen in the bulges of the esf - etgs  ( figure [ plot_prof ] ) . taken together",
    ", these points suggest that disk rejuvenation is only viable if ( 1 ) the gas has not been recently accreted and ( 2 ) the resulting sf has been ongoing for an extended period of time .    in a study of the recent sf histories of sdss galaxies , @xcite hypothesized that galaxies above a transitional surface mass density experience intense bursty sf that consumes infalling gas on timescales of @xmath375 gyr . such ( rejuvenated ) sf is likely to drive galaxies from the red sequence into the green valley",
    "the morphological and photometric data of the esf - etgs  can provide useful constraints on this model .",
    "in particular , assuming a rotation speed of 200 km  s@xmath445 at a radius of 10 kpc , and hence a rotation period of 300 myr , recently infalling gas would have experienced @xmath395 rotation periods in 1 gyr .",
    "this is likely sufficient time for the gas to settle into an axisymmetric disk .",
    "the average galaxy would be observed halfway through this period , and one would expect to see a distribution of morphologies corresponding to various stages of gas rearrangement .",
    "however , we do not see such diversity in the uv morphologies of the esf - etgs .",
    "in addition , stellar population analysis of the outer disks ( section [ sps_ext ] ) indicates that sf in the outer parts of the esf - etgs  takes place on timescales longer than 1 gyr .",
    "also , the similarity between the outer colors of the esf - etgs  and massive blue cloud galaxies [ where sf proceeds on gyr timescales @xcite ] points to a longer gas consumption timescale than that suggested by @xcite .    _ ( 3 ) gradual decline .",
    "_ in this scenario , a galaxy s _ original _ sf gradually shuts down as its existing gas supply is used to form stars @xcite .",
    "no mergers or interactions are required to explain the recent sf , and the galaxy s original ( disky ) morphology is preserved .",
    "this model reflects the general expectation that most galaxies are evolving from blue to red for the first time .",
    "gradual decline implies that sf is steadily decreasing over time , and hence that there exists an underlying population of older stars .    while the timescale for evolution from blue to red is generally believed to be fairly rapid ( @xmath375 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is certainly not expected that _ all _ galaxies need transition through the gv in such a rapid manner .",
    "indeed , local observations have shown the existence of a population of galaxies in the gv , primarily s0s , whose cold gas properties imply a much longer gv residence time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , radio observations of s0s have revealed that some harbor large reservoirs containing @xmath446 of gas or more . the gas surface density in these reservoirs , @xmath447 , fall within the -to - h@xmath448 transition regime , where the sf rate declines non - linearly with @xmath449 @xcite . specifically , the sf rate is predicted to be @xmath450 times lower than in normal spiral galaxies , i.e. , @xmath451 .",
    "these results imply a gas consumption time of up to 10 gyr in these gas - rich s0s .",
    "in other words , there likely exists a subpopulation of gv galaxies whose sf can persist at a very low level for a very long time .",
    "we find this gradual decline scenario to be another possible explanation for the recent sf seen in the esf - etgs .",
    "their undisturbed and symmetric morphologies indicate a lack of recent mergers or interactions .",
    "the blue outer disks plus red bulges are a possible extension of morphologies of galaxies slightly later along the hubble sequence , which sometimes show a hole in their central gas distributions and a lack of young stars in their bulges @xcite .",
    "moreover , the distributions of the s0 galaxies described above are typically ring - like with central depressions in gas surface density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , galex imaging of some of these s0s show uv rings reminiscent of those seen in the esf - etgs  @xcite .",
    "thus it is conceivable that the esf - etgs  harbor similar reservoirs of low - surface - density cold gas . obtaining radio observations of the esf - etgs",
    "would be extremely useful in characterizing the amount and distribution of cold gas in these objects .",
    "finally , we showed in section [ sps_ext ] that the stellar populations in the uv rings contain a significant contribution from old stars , and that their sf histories are consistent with fading @xmath365-models . assuming that the fading model applies to esf - etgs  in general , and because fading is considered an important mode of evolution through the gv",
    ", one would expect to find a significant fraction of gv galaxies with esf - like properties .",
    "section [ contamination ] showed that @xmath1 of massive galaxies in the bluest part of the gv are esf - candidates .",
    "though not a majority in this region , esf - candidates nonetheless make up a non - negligible portion of it , and we can not rule out fading for at least a subset of these objects .",
    "we note that gas - rich gv galaxies comprise @xmath452 of the total gv sample presented in @xcite .",
    "the close agreement between their fraction and the @xmath434 esf - etg gv fraction found here is intriguing and indicates that gradual decline of sf on gyr timescales should not be discounted as an important evolutionary path through the gv for some objects .    to summarize , only certain models for the sf in the esf - etgs  survive comparison with the results presented in this paper .",
    "the viable models are the slow decline of the original sf and/or ( non - bursty ) disk rejuvenation .",
    "sr2010  and paper i reach similar conclusions based on the integrated properties of the esf - etgs",
    ". in particular , both works found that the decline of the original sf is possible in a subset of the esf - etgs , and we come to a similar conclusion based on stellar population analysis of the outer disks of the esf - etgs .",
    "sr2010  also argue that the sf in some of the esf - etgs  is most consistent with rejuvenation because of their lower intrinsic dust content and larger - than - average uv sizes relative to the entire gv . while sr2010  supported rejuvenated sf , they were unable to constrain whether the necessary gas was accreted via mergers or directly from the igm .",
    "we find that mergers ( in the rapid quenching model ) are unlikely to produce the observed morphologies and lack of central sf in the esf - etgs , but igm accretion is permissible as long as it does not disrupt the galaxy and the resulting sf is not too recent and bursty .",
    "paper i reaches a similar conclusion , finding that @xmath453 of the esf - etgs  have uv and optical morphologies consistent with smooth igm accretion .",
    "rejuvenation is permitted as long as the new stars began forming long ago in a gradual manner .",
    "we have not been able to think of tests that could tell the difference , definitively , between this kind of `` extended rejuvenation '' and a simple decline of the existing sf .",
    "this paper complements the work of sr2010  and paper i. using high - resolution uv imaging from _ hst _ and optical photometry from sdss , we measure surface brightness and uv - optical color profiles of 19 esf - etgs  selected from a cross - matched sdss / galex catalog .",
    "these galaxies were selected to have high concentration , blue fuv@xmath14color , and no detectable emission lines within the sdss fiber .",
    "this combination of selection criteria yielded a sample dominated by objects with _ extended _ uv emission .",
    "our main results are summarized below .    1 .",
    "the uv - optical color profiles of the esf - etgs  all show red centers and blue outer parts , as expected given how they were selected .",
    "the central fuv@xmath14colors are consistent with red sequence galaxies ( fuv@xmath14@xmath454 ) , implying that the observed central uv emission is unlikely due to recently formed stars .",
    "by contrast , the outer fuv@xmath14colors are all quite blue ( fuv@xmath14@xmath455 ) , which is similar to star - forming , blue cloud galaxies .",
    "blue colors together with well - formed uv structures in the regions of extended uv emission point to recent sf in the outer regions of these galaxies . 2 .",
    "a comparison of the outer colors of the esf - etgs  with blue cloud galaxies in different mass ranges shows that the stellar populations in the outer disks of the esf - etgs  contain many old stars .",
    "additionally , their outer colors are consistent with gradually declining @xmath365-models that indicate old stellar population ages , as well as with a `` double-@xmath365 '' model representing a prolonged rejuvenation event .",
    "the colors are also marginally consistent with a recent - burst model .",
    "however , we roughly estimate that a bursty sf history triggered by minor mergers underpredicts the number of esf - candidates we find ( point 4 below ) by a factor of @xmath441 .",
    "3 .   based on stacked sdss spectra , we determine a mean light - weighted age of @xmath393 gyr for the centers of the esf - etgs , consistent with their red fuv@xmath14colors .",
    "we find evidence for weak liner - like emission ( i.e. , [ ] and [ ] emission ) in the central regions of the esf - etgs .",
    "if the emission is due to weak agn activity , this suggests that agn feedback may have played a role in quenching sf , particularly in the centers of these objects .",
    "if instead the liner emission is caused by gas ionization due to old stars , then this strengthens our conclusion that the centers are dominated by evolved stellar populations .",
    "4 .   by using a larger ,",
    "updated sdss / galex catalog , we find @xmath419 esf - candidate galaxies that have similar spectral and structural properties to the esf - etgs .",
    "the key change in sample selection that yielded a much larger number of esf - candidates was admitting all h@xmath401-weak objects , including liners .",
    "we find that the esf - candidates and true esf - etgs  have similar distributions in fuv@xmath14color , h@xmath401 ew , uv size , and stellar mass .",
    "a rough estimate suggests that esf - etgs  comprise @xmath1 of massive gv galaxies in their uv color - mass range .",
    "we present three possible scenarios to explain the recent sf in the esf - etgs . based on the results presented , we are able to rule out rapid quenching following a merger - induced starburst .",
    "however , our results are consistent with disk rejuvenation ( via smooth igm accretion ) and/or the gradual decline of the original sf .",
    "both scenarios can explain the regular morphologies of the esf - etgs  and the presence of underlying stars in the regions of recent sf .",
    "the similarity of some esf - etgs  to local , gas - rich s0s in the gv suggests that they are among a class of gv galaxies that may take gyrs to fully quench and reach the red sequence .",
    "the discovery of recent sf in etgs has challenged traditional explanations of the evolution of these galaxies .",
    "our understanding has benefitted greatly from all - sky surveys in the optical and , crucially , in the uv .",
    "the ability of the uv to detect even faint signatures of sf in seemingly quiescent objects highlights the richness and diversity of etgs and raises many important questions , some of which we examined in this work .",
    "our study of the esf - etgs  represents an initial attempt to constrain the evolution of galaxies in the gv .",
    "future work will systematically examine the properties and numbers of a wider range of galaxies to study the mass - dependent evolution of galaxies through the gv .",
