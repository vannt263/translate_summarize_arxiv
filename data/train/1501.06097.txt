    "in the early fifties , calabi and eckmann @xcite constructed an integrable complex structure on the cartesian product of odd - dimensional spheres @xmath1 .",

    "it is remarkable that for all non - zero @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the manifolds @xmath9 have been the first examples of closed , simply connected complex manifolds which are not algebraic .",

    "stein manifolds , complex algebraic manifolds , and open subsets of @xmath19 with the induced complex structure , are not of calabi - eckmann type .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the construction of the matsumoto - fukaya torus fibration on @xmath41 , which is a genus-1 lefschetz fibration over @xmath49 .",
    "this fibration plays a central role in the proof of theorem  [ hf ] . as an application",
    ", we derive a certain decomposition of @xmath0 in proposition  [ r^4 ] .    in section 3 ,",
    "we construct the complex structure @xmath34 as well as the holomorphic map @xmath33 , and we prove theorem  [ hf ] and corollary  [ blowups ] .",
    "[ matsumoto ] in the early eighties , yukio matsumoto constructed a genus-1 achiral lefschetz fibration @xmath50 , having two critical points of opposite signs @xcite . as it has been remarked by matsumoto himself in the same article , kenji fukaya gave an important contribution in the understanding of this fibration .",
    "for this reason , in a private conversation matsumoto suggested to us to call @xmath33 the _ matsumoto - fukaya fibration _ , and we are glad to follow his suggestion .    without going into details , @xmath33 can be defined as follows .",
    "start with the hopf fibration @xmath51 , and take the suspension @xmath52 .",
    "there is a canonical smoothing @xmath53 , which makes the suspension @xmath54 into a smooth map @xmath55 , see also @xcite for an explicit computation .",
    "the composition @xmath56 is a torus fibration with two lefschetz singularities , but the two critical points belong to the same fiber .",
    "indeed , the following formula can be easily obtained @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is thought as the unit sphere in @xmath59 defined by the equation @xmath60 in order to get two distinct singular fibers , we slightly perturb @xmath61 and the result is the matsumoto - fukaya torus fibration @xmath50 . a description of this fibration is also given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 8.4.7 ) in terms of a kirby diagram , that is depicted in figure  [ s4fib / fig ] , where the framings are referred to the blackboard framing .    .",
    "]    we now explain this kirby diagram and show how it can be derived .",
    "let @xmath62 be the positive critical value of @xmath33 , and let @xmath63 be the negative one .",
    "decompose the base space @xmath49 as the union of two disks @xmath64 and @xmath65 such that @xmath66 , and put @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68 is a tubular neighborhood of @xmath69 .",
    "it follows that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are torus bundles over the circle , that are identified by a fiber - reversing diffeomorphism .",
    "so , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are essentially the same torus bundle , but with different orientations .",
    "let us consider the ( achiral ) lefschetz fibration @xmath72 , having only one critical point .",
    "it can be easily realized that the monodromy of @xmath73 is a right handed dehn twist @xmath74 about an essential simple curve @xmath75 that can be identified with a meridian of the torus , while the monodromy of @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 . for generalities on lefschetz fibrations and their monodromies , a good reference is @xcite .",
    "a description of the monodromy and the induced handlebody decomposition is given also in @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 can be identified with @xmath73 by reversing the orientation of the base disk , and keeping the same orientation on the fiber .    since @xmath33 is built on the hopf fibration , the monodromy of the latter reflects on the gluing diffeomorphism @xmath78 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "namely , we have @xmath81 \\times t^2}{(0 , \\delta(x , y ) ) \\sim ( 2\\pi , x , y)},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 are the angular coordinates in @xmath83 , and the attaching diffeomorphism @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 , which passes to the quotient .",
    "in other words , while running over @xmath86 , the fiber rotates along the longitude of @xmath87 radians .    in figure",
    "[ s4fib / fig ] the two 2-handles attached along parallel curves correspond to the two lefschetz critical points , giving the corresponding vanishing cycles that are parallel to the curve @xmath88 .",
    "the 2-handle with framing 0 attached along the boundary of the punctured torus is needed to close the fiber .    at this point ,",
    "the kirby diagram of figure  [ s4fib2/fig ] describes the fiber sum of @xmath73 and @xmath76 along an arc in @xmath89 .     and @xmath76 .",
    "]    in order to complete the fibration , we have to glue a trivial bundle @xmath90 by a fiber - preserving diffeomorphism given by @xmath87 radians rotation in the longitudinal direction .    considering @xmath91 as a 2-handle and taking the product with the standard handle decomposition of @xmath92 we get an extra 2-handle attached along a section , that follows the longitude .",
    "a simple computation shows that this 2-handle has framing one .",
    "also , we get two 3-handles and a 4-handle .    removing a neighborhood @xmath17 of the singular point of @xmath93 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath94",
    ", we obtain @xmath0 .",
    "we define the subset @xmath17 of @xmath80 to be the standard model of the neighborhood of a negative lefschetz singularity .",
    "that is , @xmath17 is the total space of a singular annulus fibration over @xmath65 with one singular fiber and a left - handed dehn twist as the monodromy .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath17 is diffeomorphic to @xmath94 , up to smoothing the corners .",
    "then @xmath95 is the total space of a trivial annulus bundle over @xmath65 .    in other words , from the kirby diagram of figure  [ s4fib / fig ] we are removing a 4-handle , the 3-handle that comes from the longitude of the torus , and the 2-handle with framing one that comes from the negative lefschetz critical point , thus obtaining the diagram of figure  [ r4fib / fig ] .",
    "a simple computation shows that this represents @xmath94 , taking into account that the 3-handle immediately cancels with the 0-framed 2-handle , as it results from its attaching map .",
    "this kirby diagram encodes the map @xmath96 as part of the matsumoto - fukaya fibration .     on @xmath94 . ]",
    "the above considerations can be resumed in the following proposition , where @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "[ r^4 ] if we glue @xmath98 to @xmath79 along @xmath99 so that for each @xmath100 , the annulus @xmath101 embeds in @xmath102 as a thickened meridian , and it rotates in the longitude direction once when @xmath103 rotates once , then the resulting manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath94 , and so the interior is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "in the following we make use of the notations @xmath104 , @xmath105 , for @xmath106 .",
    "we put also @xmath107 . for a given @xmath108 such that @xmath109",
    ", we consider the smooth elliptic curve @xmath110 , where the action is given by @xmath111 .",
    "we call the curve @xmath112 the meridian and the curve @xmath113 the longitude of the torus",
    ". these meridian and longitude can be identfied with those of the previous section .",
    "we begin with the construction of the complex structure @xmath34 . since @xmath79 is the total space of a positive genus-@xmath114 lefschetz fibration over the @xmath115-disk with one singular fiber , there exists a complex structure such that the fibration @xmath116 is holomorphic .",
    "indeed , we consider a holomorphic elliptic fibration over @xmath49 , and we take a tubular neighborhood of a singular fiber which is fiberwise diffeomorphic with @xmath79 ( see also @xcite ) . according to @xcite , we can give a more explicit model of @xmath117 by the weierstrass curves .",

    ", the singular elliptic fiber is defined by the equation @xmath125 and it has an ordinary double point at @xmath126 .",
    "hence , the canonical projection @xmath127 restricts to a holomorphic map @xmath128 , which is a genus-@xmath114 holomorphic lefschetz fibration over the @xmath115-disk with one singular fiber .",
    "thus , the complex manifold @xmath43 is a complex model of @xmath117 .",
    "now , we consider the quotient @xmath129 , where for any @xmath130 , the action is given by @xmath131 this elliptic fibration extends over @xmath132 .",
    "let us denote the completion by @xmath133 .",
    "kodaira gave an explicit biholomorphism between @xmath133 and @xmath43 ( see @xcite , pp .",
    "597599 ) .",
    "so , in the following we shall consider @xmath133 as the model of @xmath117 , instead of the weierstrass model @xmath43 .",
    "we fix a holomorphic atlas on the riemann sphere given by two open disks @xmath134 and @xmath135 . the disk @xmath136 is biholomorphic with @xmath137 and @xmath138 is biholomorphic with @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is arbitrarily chosen , and the transition function @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 .",
    "we define the complex structure on the topologically trivial annulus bundle @xmath143 , considered over @xmath144 , by the product structure @xmath145 .",
    "next , we want to glue @xmath146 with @xmath147 analytically along @xmath148 , so that the attaching map is isotopic to that of the matsumoto - fukaya fibration , implying that the resulting manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 . in order to do this ,",
    "we need to choose an attaching region in @xmath133 which is biholomorphic to the product @xmath149 . in the following argument",
    ", we show how to take such a region in @xmath133 .",
    "we begin with a multi - valued holomorphic function @xmath150 such that multiplication by @xmath151 for all @xmath152 , determines a transitive @xmath153-action on the set of the branches of @xmath78 . in other words ,",
    "given any branch @xmath154 of @xmath78 , all the other branches are of the form @xmath155 for an arbitrary @xmath152 .    for example ,",
    "as it can be easily verified , we can take @xmath156 where the two logarithms are taken simultaneously with all of their possible branches .",
    "next , consider the open subset @xmath157 defined by @xmath158 then , @xmath159 can be parameterized by the multi - valued local holomorphic immersion @xmath160 defined by @xmath161 .",
    "notice that @xmath159 is invariant under the action of @xmath153 on @xmath162 .",
    "it follows that the composition of @xmath163 with the quotient map @xmath164 is a single - valued holomorphic embedding , and we denote by @xmath165 the image of @xmath159 in @xmath133 .",
    "also notice that @xmath166 is a holomorphic annulus bundle , and @xmath163 determines a trivialization of this bundle .",
    "let @xmath167 be the biholomorphism defined by @xmath168 .",
    "we use @xmath169 as the attaching biholomorphism for making the union @xmath170 which therefore is a complex manifold .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the complex structure of @xmath42 .    in order to identify the topology of @xmath42 ,",
    "we consider how the annulus fiber of @xmath171 looks inside the toric fiber of @xmath146 .",
    "let @xmath172 be a complex number of some fixed modulus , and of arbitrary argument @xmath173 .",
    "when @xmath174 varies from @xmath175 to @xmath87 , a point @xmath176 of the fiber @xmath177 moves accordingly with the @xmath153-action on the branches of @xmath78 , which encodes the attaching biholomorphism .",
    "namely , @xmath176 goes to @xmath178 , that is in the next fundamental domain of the @xmath153-action on @xmath179 that gives the torus @xmath180 .",
    "this means that when @xmath181 rotates once in the argument direction , the annulus @xmath182 rotates once in the longitude direction of the fiber torus @xmath183 , and this coincides with the attaching map of the matsumoto - fukaya fibration restricted on @xmath184 .",
    "this implies that @xmath42 is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "observe that the number @xmath185 is auxiliary . indeed , its role is just to provide an open subset @xmath165 of @xmath117 which is necessary for the analytical gluing .",
    "namely , @xmath185 only determines the size of the attaching region of the two complex manifolds .",
    "hence , @xmath42 does not depend on @xmath185 up to biholomorphisms .",
    "moreover , we can define a surjective holomorphic map @xmath186 by @xmath187 if @xmath188 and @xmath189 if @xmath190 .",
    "notice that @xmath191 is isotopic to the restriction of the matsumoto - fukaya fibration @xmath33 ( up to the diffeomorphism @xmath192 ) .",
    "actually , the isotopy can be chosen to be smooth with respect to the parameters @xmath193 , and up to this isotopy we can assume that @xmath194 itself is a holomorphic fibration with respect to all of the complex structures @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , the complex hessian of @xmath33 at the critical point , computed with respect to @xmath34 , is of maximal rank because this complex structure on @xmath133 coincides with that of the weierstrass curves model .",
    "since @xmath33 has holomorphic tori as fibers , it follows that @xmath42 is of calabi - eckmann type .",
    "moreover , statements @xmath39 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 of the theorem are implicit in the construction .",
    "the non - existence of non - constant holomorphic functions also follows easily , since there is an open subset of @xmath38 , namely @xmath133 , which is foliated by compact holomorphic curves , hence a holomorphic function @xmath197 must be constant on these fibers . therefore , the differential of @xmath45 is zero along those compact fibers .",
    "since @xmath198 is a holomorphic 1-form , it follows that @xmath199 is zero even along the annulus fibers of @xmath33 , and this implies that @xmath45 is constant on the fibers of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath45 factorizes by the fibration @xmath33 .",
    "namely , there is a holomorphic function @xmath200 such that @xmath201 .",
    "since @xmath202 is constant , @xmath45 is also constant .",
    "this proves statement @xmath203 .",
    "now we give the proof of statement @xmath204 , which is based on proposition  [ classcurv / thm ] that will be proved at the end of this section . by proposition  [ classcurv / thm ] , the union of all compact holomorphic curves of @xmath38 is the open subset @xmath133 .",
    "analogously , we denote by @xmath205 the union of the compact holomorphic curves of @xmath206 .",
    "suppose that there is a biholomorphism @xmath207 .",
    "we want to show that @xmath208 .",
    "the above discussion implies that @xmath45 decomposes into two biholomorphisms @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 is fiber - preserving on @xmath133 , and so @xmath211 passes to the quotient , giving a biholomorphism @xmath212 . by analyticity",
    ", @xmath45 must be fiber - preserving also on @xmath213 .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath214 , because of the well - known holomorphic classification of complex annuli .",
    "the torus @xmath183 that corresponds to the complex number @xmath215 , is isomorphic to a complex torus of the form @xmath216 , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 .    by the classification of complex non - singular elliptic curves",
    ", @xmath202 must be the identity because @xmath183 is isomorphic to @xmath219 for all @xmath215 . therefore",
    ", we obtain @xmath220 .",
    "it is sufficient to show that @xmath221 is constant .",
    "in fact , @xmath222 is homotopic to a constant , since it factorizes through the contractible space @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath221 is of degree zero .",
    "since it is a holomorphic map between compact riemann surfaces , it must be constant .    finally , we prove corollary  [ blowups ] .",
    "since the blowup affects @xmath42 only at finitely many points , after blowing up , there are still embedded holomorphic tori which are homotopically trivial .",
    "then , @xmath223 is of calabi - eckmann type .",
    "moreover , if @xmath224 and @xmath225 are biholomorphic , then it follows that @xmath226 and @xmath227 by the same argument in the proof of theorem  [ hf ] @xmath204 . since @xmath224 is diffeomorphic to @xmath228 , there are uncountably many distinct non - khler complex structures on @xmath228",
    ".    finally , if @xmath229 is a holomorphic function on @xmath223 , it must be constant on the exceptional spheres , and so it factorizes through the blowup map @xmath230 hence , @xmath229 is constant .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "corollary  [ blowups ] holds even for @xmath231 , and the proof is essentially the same . by making the points for the blowups to vary ,",
