    "publication of the analysis of type ia supernovae red shift data by the high - z supernova search team @xcite and the supernova cosmology project @xcite provided the first indication that the universe is accelerating .",
    "the data favor an interpretation in which most of the energy in the universe is some form of dark energy capable of providing negative pressure .",
    "the usual candidate for the dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath0 , which , as the name suggests , gives a time independent dark energy density .",
    "both groups analyze their data assuming contributions from ordinary matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "they present their results as @xmath1 contours the the plane of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , defined below , which are a measure of the relative contributions of matter and dark energy @xcite . from these plots ( e.g. , fig.[p_w=-1 ] and table[fits ] ) , it is clear that values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are most probably those of an accelerating cosmology .",
    "while this picture is attractive because of its simplicity , one can ask to what extent the data can distinguish between alternative hypotheses for the behavior of the dark energy .",
    "investigations into this question are generally framed in terms of determining the equation of state of the dark component ( @xmath4 ) , that is , determining @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure of the dark component and @xmath7 is its energy density , as a function of the scale parameter @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to quantify the effect of any particular @xmath9 by fitting the supernova data and comparing the resulting value of @xmath1 with the one for @xmath10 , which corresponds to the case of a cosmological constant .    in the next section ,",
    "we review briefly the strategy for extracting the cosmological parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the effective magnitude data for type ia supernovae , and use a straightforward @xmath1 minimization to reproduce the results of refs.@xcite and @xcite . in section [ quin ] ,",
    "we use the values of @xmath1 for @xmath10 to explore several modifications to the equation of state including a search for the minimum @xmath1 for the case @xmath11 .",
    "changes in the pressure - density relation of this type or similar modifications , including models using a chaplygin equation of state @xcite or generalized cardassian expansion @xcite , have been considered before .",
    "our discussion is included here as a prologue to section [ visc ] , where we present a model in which the dark component is a fluid with a bulk viscosity .",
    "it is shown that this model provides an equally good fit to the supernova data , predicts an accelerating universe and has mass density fluctuations which grow .",
    "all of this occurs at the expense of some entropy production .",
    "finally , we conclude with some comments on the current supernova data s capacity to discriminate between models of the dark energy .",
    "if @xmath8 is the scale parameter in the robertson - walker metric and @xmath12 its curvature constant , the friedmann equations with a cosmological constant are @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is newton s constant , @xmath15 is the density of matter , @xmath16 its pressure and a dot denotes time differentiation .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum gives the additional relation @xmath17    letting @xmath18 , and denoting the present time by the subscript 0 , eq.([vel ] ) can be divided by @xmath19 , the square of the hubble constant , to give @xmath20 at present and @xmath21 in general . assuming the pressure of ordinary matter is negligible , eq.([cons ] ) gives @xmath22 and , in terms of the scaled variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 , eq.([hsq ] ) becomes @xmath25 from eq.([hsqy ] ) ,",
    "the time history of the universe can be obtained as @xmath26 owing to the cubic behavior of the denominator of eq.([hist ] ) , the @xmath27 plane is divided into different categories of histories depending on whether a zero of the cubic occurs for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , or @xmath30 .",
    "these are , respectively , those universes which continue to increase in size from @xmath31 , those which never achieve @xmath31 and those which start at @xmath31 , increase to a maximum size and then collapse",
    ". the boundaries of these regions can be seen , for example , in fig.[p_w=-1 ] along with the line corresponding to flat cosmologies , @xmath32 .",
    "also , at the present time , eq.([acc ] ) can be written @xmath33 and hence the universe is accelerating if @xmath34 .",
    "the extraction of the cosmological parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 is achieved by relating the apparent magnitudes of @xmath35 of the type ia supernovae and their absolute magnitudes @xmath36 to their luminosity distance @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is measured in megaparsecs .",
    "the luminosity distance of a supernova at red shift @xmath40 can be expressed as @xmath41\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath42 denoting the velocity of light . in eq.([dl ] ) , @xmath43 $ ] is used for @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] is used for @xmath46 , and the unmodified square bracket is used for @xmath47 .    to obtain a fit to the data ,",
    "we write the apparent magnitude as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is an additive constant .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are then determined by minimizing @xmath53 with @xmath54 denoting the error in @xmath55 .",
    "our fit @xcite to the data presented in ref.@xcite is shown in fig.[p_w=-1 ] . to avoid repetition ,",
    "we restrict our fits to this data .",
    "we have obtained similar results for the data in ref.@xcite . when computing points on the @xmath56 contours , we choose the minimum value of @xmath52 at each point ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is easily done because the minimization condition for @xmath52 can be solved explicitly in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the values of @xmath57 plotted ( 2.30,4.61,6.18 ) would correspond to 67.3% , 90.0% and 95.5% confidence contours if the errors were gaussian .",
    "the contours are not precisely elliptical indicating non - gaussian behavior , and this is addressed in the detailed analysis of refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "fortunately , our more naive analysis yields very similar @xmath57 contours , which we can use to assess the quality of the fits resulting from different assumptions about the dark component .    for the most part ,",
    "the fit shown in fig.[p_w=-1 ] lies above the dashed line separating accelerating from non - accelerating cosmologies . while the best fit is not a flat cosmology ,",
    "the @xmath1 values in table [ fits ] show that requiring @xmath58 does not dramatically alter the quality of the fit .",
    "to generalize beyond the case of a constant dark energy , we can write eq.([vel ] ) as @xmath59 and determine the dark energy density @xmath7 using the energy conservation equation @xmath60 together with the equation of state @xmath61 for models of this type , the generalization of eq.([hsqy ] ) is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is @xmath64    when @xmath65 is a constant , say @xmath66 , the boundaries in the @xmath67 plane between regions of expanding universes and universes which eventually collapse or have no big bang are obtained by determining where the minimum of the function @xmath68 vanishes . this leads to the equation @xmath69 from which @xmath63 can be found as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath70 , eq.([bndry ] ) gives the familiar results for the case of a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "for these models , the generalization of eq.([acc ] ) is @xmath71 at the present time , this gives the acceleration parameter @xmath72 and hence the universe is accelerating if @xmath73    to gain some sense of what varying the value of @xmath74 does to the quality of the fits , we performed a @xmath1 analysis of the data in ref.@xcite for the case @xmath75 and for the case where @xmath74 is varied along with the other parameters to obtain the best fit .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[p_w=-067 ] and [ p_w=-073 ] and the best fits are given in table [ quin1 ] .",
    "these examples show that the quality of the fits to the data of ref.@xcite for the cases considered ",
    "@xmath76  is basically the same .",
    "even when the value of @xmath9 is allowed to vary , the minimum in @xmath1 is not lowered in any significant way .",
    "one may argue that values of @xmath77 are less preferred since , as suggested by fig.[p_w=-067 ] , their @xmath1 contours encroach into the region of cosmologies which have no big bang .",
    "the constant equations of state discussed above ( @xmath78 ) all result power law dark energy densities of the form @xmath79 and all lead to fits with comparable @xmath1 . to determine how changing the functional dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath80",
    "affects the quality of the fits , we examined equations of state of the form @xmath81 .",
    "these equations of state lead to dark energy densities with an exponential dependence of the form @xmath82 in order to make direct comparisons with the constant @xmath9 cases , we fit the data of ref.@xcite using @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "these fits are shown in figs.[p_w=-067y ] and [ p_w =- y ] .",
    "the numerical details are given in table[quin2 ] .",
    "again , the @xmath1 of these fits indicates that data are not too sensitive to the @xmath80-dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the location and size of the contours suggest that the @xmath85 choice is the more desirable .",
    "the lifetime of the universe depends on the choice of @xmath9 and can be used to discriminate among various models .",
    "fig.[newlife_2 ] shows the @xmath67 plane for four different choices of @xmath9 along with lines of constant lifetime .",
    "generally , the @xmath1 contours lie between 11.9 and 19.0 gyr .",
    "as an alternative to simply modifying the equation of state of the dark component , in this section we consider the consequences of assuming the dark energy consists of a fluid having a bulk viscosity @xmath86 .",
    "if a bulk viscosity term is introduced into the energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid , one effect is to replace eq.([cons ] ) with @xcite @xmath87 in view of eq.([velx ] ) , the expression for @xmath88 depends on the dark energy density @xmath7 in a nonlinear fashion , which means that , unlike the case of the multiplicative equations considered previously , eq.([consv ] ) is not separable . in general",
    ", it must be solved numerically .",
    "if we assume that the pressure @xmath6 of the dark component is negligible , the differential equation determining @xmath7 is @xmath89 or , using eq.([velx ] ) , @xmath90 it is more convenient to write a differential equation for @xmath91 since @xmath92 is the quantity needed to determine the luminosity distance @xmath39 .",
    "this differential equation is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 the second equality follows from eq.([omx ] ) .",
    "since the luminosity distance is given by @xmath96\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is obtained by replacing @xmath80 by @xmath98 , we write the differential equation in terms of @xmath40 , and solve @xmath99 from the form of eq.([dhdz ] ) , the expression for the apparent magnitude @xmath35 depends on the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath100 , which we can vary to obtain a fit to the supernova data .",
    "we perform the integration in eq.([viscdl ] ) numerically , determining @xmath101 using a four point runge - kutta algorithm and the boundary condition @xmath102 to first solve the differential equation . given @xmath37 , for the data point @xmath103 ,",
    "we then minimize @xmath1 as in eqs.([appmag ] ) and ( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 contours are shown in fig.[viscage_1 ] and the best fits are listed in table [ viscfit ] . in fig.[viscage_1 ] , the lines corresponding to various values of @xmath2 indicate the boundary of the region below which , for that @xmath2 , the dark energy density @xmath7 remains positive .",
    "this is determined by the condition @xmath104 which is analyzed by choosing value of @xmath2 , fixing @xmath94 , taking @xmath100 to be large and negative and solving eq.([dhdz ] ) for @xmath105 .",
    "if condition eq.([rhopos ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath40 , @xmath100 is increased and the process is repeated until , for a sufficiently large value of @xmath100 , eq.([rhopos ] ) is violated for some @xmath40 .",
    "this determines a point @xmath106 on the curve for the given @xmath2 and the region above this curve is not allowed .",
    "the range of lifetimes for this case , obtained from the relation @xmath107 is shown in fig.[viscage_2 ] . here , unlike the cases of secs.[cosconst ] and [ quin ]",
    ", the lifetime can not be much less than 14 gyr .",
    "the lines of constant lifetime terminate on the dark black line in this figure and fig.[viscage_1 ] . for @xmath100 and @xmath94 above this line , the lifetime integral does not converge . in each of these figures ,",
    "the dotted line separates the accelerating from the non - accelerating cosmologies , with the region above the line corresponding to accelerating cosmologies .",
    "this can be seen by noting that analog of eq.([quinacc ] ) is @xmath108 which gives at the present time @xmath109 hence , accelerating cosmologies satisfy @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related by an equation of state of the form @xmath111 , the cosmology evolves at constant entropy . in the present case",
    ", there is entropy production .",
    "this can be seen by noting that @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the temperature of the dark energy .",
    "on using eq.([consv ] ) , we have @xmath114 considering @xmath115 as a function of @xmath23 , the evolution of @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 . with the aid of eq.([hsqx ] ) , the entropy is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is obtained by solving eq.([hsqde ] ) . setting @xmath121 and using eq.([adef ] ) to eliminate @xmath86 , the change in the entropy density at present",

    "the choice of @xmath127 must be consistent with the integrability of the entropy , which , for @xmath128 taken to be a function of @xmath129 and @xmath7 , requires @xcite @xmath130 using eq.([integ ] ) and eq.([consv ] ) , it is possible to obtain the relation @xmath131 assuming @xmath132 , eq.([integ ] ) implies that @xmath133 has the general form @xmath134 and , for the purpose of assessing the entropy growth , we examine a single term of the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a constant . in this case ,",

    "the ratio of the present value of the entropy density produced by the viscous medium to the entropy density of the microwave background is plotted in fig.[entropy ] for several values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 taken to be the temperature of the microwave background , @xmath143k .",
    "the numerical results scale as @xmath144 . clearly , a side effect of the viscosity being adequate to produce an accelerating cosmology is the production of large amounts of entropy .",
    "although we are assuming that the matter and dark energy densities constitute non - interacting components of the total energy density , it is nevertheless necessary to check the compatibility of this assumption with the existence of matter density fluctuations which grow at large z ( or small y ) . for an inviscid fluid in the newtonian limit , a matter density fluctuation @xmath145 satisfies the equation @xmath146 and the influence of the viscous dark energy enters through the @xmath88 term . using eqs.([velx ] ) and ( [ hsqx ] ) , the differential equation eq.([dhdz ] ) , and assuming that @xmath147 , the equation for @xmath145 can be written @xmath148 where the @xmath149 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath40 . to solve this equation for large @xmath40",

    "the curves of constant exponent @xmath158 for several values of @xmath2 are shown in fig.[viscdel ] .",
    "the regions below the @xmath159 curves have matter density fluctuations which grow , the trend being toward slower growth for larger negative values of @xmath100 .",
    "when analyzed in terms of a universe consisting of matter and dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant , the supernova data of refs.@xcite favor an accelerating universe .",
    "the best fits in this case do not correspond to a flat cosmology , but a flat solution is well within the likelihood contours with a @xmath1 relatively close to the minimum value of @xmath1 .",
    "our ability to reproduce the results of refs.@xcite is indicated in table[fits ] .    as a means of assessing the sensitivity of the currently available supernova data to the form of the equation of state @xmath160",
    ", we repeated the analysis using equations of state of the form @xmath161 for @xmath162 and a number of different values of @xmath74 , with @xmath163 , we find best fits with @xmath1 very nearly identical to those obtained for a cosmological constant .",
    "this includes a determination of the best value of @xmath74 by treating @xmath74 as one of the search parameters . in these cases",
    ", the sum @xmath164 tends to be a bit larger than @xmath165 , and the flat cosmology value of @xmath2 is somewhat smaller than the corresponding value obtain for a cosmological constant .",
    "when @xmath166 and @xmath167 is varied , the quality of the fits in terms of @xmath1 is again virtually unchanged .",
    "the case @xmath85 is very similar to @xmath10 in all respects , as can be seen by comparing figs.[p_w=-1 ] and [ p_w =- y ] .",
    "this tendency of the minimum value of @xmath1 to be the same as long as the equation of state describes a dark energy with negative pressure is another indication that the precise form of @xmath9 is ill determined by the current supernova data @xcite .    to examine whether the introduction of a negative pressure component by means of a multiplicative equation of state was essential ,",
    "we explored the notion that the dark energy is a fluid with bulk viscosity .",
    "the bulk viscosity provides a negative pressure and , again , a fit to the supernova data gives a @xmath1 that is indistinguishable from the cosmological constant case ( compare tables [ viscfit ] and [ fits ] ) .",
    "we have shown that such a dark energy can provide a fit which is consistent with an accelerating flat cosmology having reasonable values for the lifetime and @xmath2 and density fluctuations with the appropriate behavior .",
    "there remains a question of whether the use of a simple linear bulk viscosity term @xmath168 is valid throughout the range of @xmath169 s probed by the supernova data .",
    "there are known non - linear effects , usually associated with viscosity - driven inflation models , which could modify our results @xcite .",
    "we have not attempted to include them in this investigation .",
    "the model presented here is different from those which suggest that viscosity effects associated with cold dark matter could be the source of the observed acceleration @xcite .",
    "viscosity effects have also been discussed in models with matter creation @xcite .",
    "this approach to the inclusion of bulk viscosity is highly testable in the sense that future measurements could rule it out . as mentioned above",
    ", the lifetime can not be much less than 14 gyr .",
    "further , if the universe is flat , or nearly so , as seems likely , then we require @xmath2 to be rather small .",
    "a close examination of fig.[viscage_1 ] near @xmath47 reveals that the present supernova data rule out @xmath170 at the 90% level . on the other hand ,",
    "improving the supernova contours is unlikely to rule out this model , even for a flat universe , as long as @xmath171 is allowed .",
    "we would like to thank marcello lissia , vic teplitz and rocky kolb for helpful comments .",
