    "even in hot systems where conduction is potent , fine tuning of the suppression factor @xmath8 ( the fraction by which spitzer conductivity is reduced due to , e.g. , tangled magnetic field lines ) is required @xcite . moreover , if the thermal conduction has the same temperature dependence as the spitzer conductivity ( i.e. if @xmath8 is a constant ) for a given icm atmosphere , the resulting equilibria are thermally unstable ( e.g. @xcite ; see further discussion in sections [ sec : balance ] and [ sec : conduction ] ) .",
    "more recently , however , there has been renewed interest in the possibility that thermal conduction may provide sufficient heating to stably counteract the effects of radiative cooling .",
    "this has gone hand - in - hand with a dramatic increase in our understanding of ` dilute ' ( i.e. only weakly collisional ) plasmas , due to the appreciation that even very weak magnetic fields introduce an anisotropy into heat fluxes",
    ". one important consequence is that the criterion for convective instability changes to one of temperature , rather than entropy , increasing downwards @xcite .",

    "@xcite conjectured that the nonlinear hbi is self - regulating and drives a reverse convective thermal flux , both of which may mediate the stabilisation of cooling cores .",
    "numerical simulations of the hbi have been performed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with applications to the icm .",

    "the recent observation that magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind are bounded by the firehose and mirror stability thresholds strongly supports the expectation that equation ( [ eqn : marginality ] ) will be satisfied in a turbulent plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two fundamental physical ways in which marginal stability to microscale instabilities can be maintained in a weakly collisional plasma .",
    "_ either _ microstabilities give rise to some effective particle scattering mechanism that isotropises the pressure @xcite _ or _ they modify on the average the structure and time evolution of the magnetic field ( or , equivalently , of the rate of strain ) so as to cancel the pressure anisotropy caused by the changing fields .",
    "while there is no complete microphysical theory , existing calculations of particular cases @xcite all suggest the latter scenario . in this work",
    "we will _ assume _ that this is what happens .",
    "importantly , this means that the collision rate is _ not _ modified by the instabilities .",
    "let us now use this assumption to calculate the heating rate ( per unit volume ) due to parallel viscous dissipation of motions . from equations ( [ eqn",

    "this is provided by @xcite : @xmath70 this equation states that the rate of strain due to turbulent motions generates a pressure anisotropy that is relaxed on the ion - ion collision timescale .",
    "we interpret the right - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : braginskii ] ) as including contributions to the ( average ) turbulent rate of strain from both the microscopic and macroscopic motions ( see @xcite for a detailed kinetic calculation of one example where this is justified ) . under the assumption that the collision frequency is not modified by the instabilities , equation ( [ eqn : braginskii ] ) , together with equation ( [ eqn : marginality ] ) ,",
    "states that microscale fluctuations adjust themselves in response to large - scale fluid motions in order to maintain and preserve marginality .    using equation ( [ eqn : braginskii ] ) in equation ( [ eqn : heating1 ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath71 in other words , the ion pressure anisotropy is a source of free energy that is eventually converted into heat by collisions . with marginality to microscale instabilities imposed according to equation ( [ eqn : marginality ] ) ,",

    "parallel viscous heating rate _ ( per unit volume ) is @xmath73 note the lack of an explicit dependence on density and also , remarkably , on either the amplitude or the rate of strain of the turbulence .",
    "however , the strong dependence on @xmath42 does encode information about all of these .",
    "as the turbulent velocity increases , so too will the strength of the ( dynamo - generated ) magnetic field ( see section [ sec : velocities ] ) , and the dissipation rate ( eq . [ eqn : heating4 ] ) will increase accordingly .",
    "in other words , the dissipation rate can be self - regulating .",
    "this local self - regulation is completely independent of whatever global self - regulation may be offered by the external source that is providing the turbulent energy ( e.g. the agns ) , as long as there is enough turbulence to maintain the pressure anisotropy at its stability threshold ( eq . [ eqn : marginality ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the physical picture encapsulated by equation ( [ eqn : heating4 ] ) is somewhat different from the conventional approach to turbulence theory .",
    "namely , in standard turbulence theory , one assumes that the energy input from external driving is fixed ( i.e. given ) and that all of that power is converted into turbulence and ultimately microphysically dissipated . in other words ,",
    "the dissipation rate will adjust according to the rate at which external energy is input . in the icm",
    ", there is a microscale constraint on the total turbulent rate of strain , namely , equation ( [ eqn : marginality ] ) .",
    "although the dissipation can self - regulate via the strength of the magnetic field as described above , not all of the power provided by the external driving in fact need be locally thermalised via turbulence . indeed ,",
    "the turbulence may have an effective ` impedance ' and only accept the amount of power that can be locally viscously dissipated without triggering the microinstabilities .",
    "a further discussion of these points is given at the end of section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the similarity between the coefficients in equations ( [ eqn : cooling2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : heating4 ] ) is striking and strongly suggests that _ parallel viscous heating can offset radiative losses in the deep interiors of cluster cores_. however , it is not enough simply to find a heating source capable of balancing cooling .",
    "one must also ensure that the resulting equilibrium is thermally stable .",
    "this can be shown for our proposed heating mechanism as follows .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : stability ] , we show the rates of parallel viscous heating ( solid line ) and radiative cooling ( dashed line ) at fixed magnetic and thermal pressures as a function of temperature . the thermal equilibrium point where heating balances cooling is denoted by a black dot .",
    "the cooling rate ( dashed line ) scales as @xmath74 in the bremsstrahlung regime , while the parallel viscous heating rate ( solid line ) scales as @xmath75 .",
    "hence , if the temperature is perturbed downwards , the heating rate increases faster than the rate of radiative cooling , and net heating restores the temperature to its equilibrium value .",
    "on the other hand , if the temperature is perturbed upwards , the heating rate decreases faster than the rate of radiative cooling , and net cooling restores the temperature to its equilibrium value .",
    "in other words , _ parallel viscosity , regulated by the growth of microscale instabilities , endows the large - scale plasma with a source of viscous heating that makes the plasma thermally stable_.    this is in stark contrast to a thermal balance between radiative cooling and thermal conduction ( dotted line ) , whose heating rate scales as @xmath76 at fixed thermal pressure .",
    "the resulting equilibrium is unstable , with an isobaric perturbation resulting in either an isothermal temperature profile ( e.g. see fig .  7 of @xcite ) or a cooling catastrophe .",
    "thus , spitzer conduction by itself can not balance radiative cooling in a stable way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     at a fixed pressure .",
    "the thermal equilibrium point where heating balances cooling is denoted by a black dot . for a positive temperature perturbation from equilibrium , radiative cooling dominates over parallel viscous heating , whereas for a negative temperature perturbation from equilibrium , parallel viscous heating dominates over radiative cooling . hence the equilibrium is stable to isobaric perturbations .",
    "by contrast , thermal balance between thermal conduction ( dotted line ) and radiative cooling is unstable.,width=307 ]    the thermal stability argument for a balance between parallel viscous heating and radiative cooling may be refined by allowing for the possibility that the magnetic - field strength is not fixed , but rather depends on density and temperature in some unknown way .",

    "@xmath89 @xmath90 if we define @xmath91 we find that the fractional perturbation in the density is related to the fractional perturbation in the temperature by @xmath92 note that this reduces to requiring a constant thermal pressure in the limit @xmath93 .",
    "substituting equation ( [ eqn : npert ] ) into equations ( [ eqn : qmpert ] ) and ( [ eqn : qppert ] ) , we find @xmath94 @xmath95 from this , it follows that the loss function ( i.e. heat losses minus heat gains ) is @xmath96.\\nonumber\\\\*\\mbox{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath97 in the icm ( see eq .",

    "given the apparent ability of parallel viscous heating to balance radiative cooling and stabilise the centres of cool - core clusters , it is tempting to ascribe the entire temperature profile inside the cooling radius to a long - term balance between this form of heating and cooling . in this section , we investigate what this implies for magnetic - field strengths , turbulent velocities and turbulence scales throughout cluster cores as functions of radius @xmath101 .",

    "none of these clusters can be in thermal balance between thermal conduction and radiative cooling .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a model for regulating cooling in cluster cores in which turbulence , magnetic fields and plasma physics all play crucial roles . our findings are fundamentally based on an appreciation that , whatever the source of effective viscosity in the icm , it is certainly not hydrodynamic . instead , it is set by the microscale plasma - physical processes , which are inevitable in a weakly collisional , magnetised environment such as the icm .",
    "assuming that microscale plasma instabilities pin the pressure anisotropy at its marginally stable value , we derive an expression for the heating rate due to parallel viscous dissipation of turbulent motions . for typical conditions in a variety of cluster cores ,",
    "this rate is of the right magnitude to balance radiative cooling .",
    "moreover , this source of heating turns out to be thermally stable . put simply , the viscous stress in the icm",
    "is a dynamic quantity that responds to local changes in temperature , density and magnetic - field strength in such a way as to prevent runaway heating or cooling .",
    "a basic qualitative outline of how this occurs is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline ] .",
    "if true , what we have conjectured constitutes a physical mechanism that allows clusters to develop stable non - isothermal temperature profiles and avoid a cooling catastrophe  an outcome that has remained elusive in models involving balancing the cooling by thermal conduction .",
    "of the five quantities  density , temperature , rms magnetic - field strength , rms turbulent velocity , characteristic turbulence scale  given radial profiles of any two , we can predict the rest .",
    "the most reliable , as well as readily observable , predictions that follow from our theory concern the ( rms ) magnetic - field strength . for typical electron densities and temperatures ,",
    "we predict magnetic - field strengths in the range",
    "@xmath36  @xmath35 , well within current observational constraints . for the specific clusters discussed here ( e.g. a1835 ,",
    "hydra a , a2199 , a2382 , a2255 ) , a balance between parallel viscous heating and radiative cooling results in field strengths and profiles that are quite reasonable and in good agreement with current observational estimates where available .",
    "it would be interesting to test our model further via analysis of faraday rotation maps .",
    "another prediction is the manner in which the magnetic - field strength @xmath42 depends on electron density @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 ( eq . [ eqn : bprofile ] ) : @xmath230 in cool - core clusters , this suggests that the oft - employed assumption of an exclusive relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath13 should be relaxed .",
    "it is encouraging that , in isothermal clusters , the implied scaling @xmath231 has already been observationally inferred to hold in a2382 @xcite , coma @xcite and a665 @xcite .",
    "a caveat here is that a local heating - cooling balance in such clusters may take very long to establish and so should be treated with due scepticism .",
    "a test of whether this conjecture is reasonable would be to determine whether equation ( [ eqn : bscalingiso ] ) is satisfied systematically in a large sample of isothermal clusters .",
    "there are several peripheral consequences of our predictions that warrant further discussion .",
    "firstly , the relatively large magnetic - field strengths inferred from observed rotation measures and predicted by a balance between parallel viscous heating and radiative cooling are stable or at least marginally stable to the hbi .",
    "the stability criterion for the hbi @xcite may be written as a lower - bound on the magnetic - field strength : @xmath232 even under the favourable conditions we have chosen for the electron density @xmath13 , the radial distance from the cluster centre @xmath101 and the temperature slope @xmath233 , the magnetic fields predicted in this paper exceed the stability limit ( [ eqn : hbi ] ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite found that simulated clusters with magnetic - field strengths @xmath234 demonstrated a delayed cooling catastrophe due to the stabilisation of hbi modes by magnetic tension .",
    "by contrast , the rms magnetic - field strength used in the @xcite simulation , where a combination of turbulent stirring and hbi - governed thermal conduction gave a cool core in long - term thermal balance , was @xmath235 .",
    "more observational estimates of magnetic - field strengths in a variety of clusters would clearly be very useful to help realistic modelling and testing of theories .    secondly , the same process that is responsible for stably heating the icm in our model may also influence the turbulent diffusion of metals throughout the cores of galaxy clusters . that our values for the turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath152 are comparable to those inferred in a variety of clusters is encouraging",
    "however , @xcite found that diffusion coefficients that increase with radius ( as ours does ) imply abundance profiles that are too centrally peaked compared to those observed .",
    "it is therefore worth investigating the diffusion of metals using our predicted scaling @xmath236 .",
    "thirdly , turbulent heat diffusion may become dominant relative to collisional electron heat conduction if the spitzer conductivity suppression factor @xmath237 ( see eqns [ eqn : kprofile ] and [ eqn : ksp1 ] ) .",
    "however , for typical density and temperature profiles of cool - core clusters , neither form of heat diffusion seems to be important relative to parallel viscous heating ( see section [ sec : conduction ] ) .",
    "it is prudent to reiterate here our assumptions and their limitations :    1 .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that there is enough turbulent energy so that , if it is thermalised via parallel viscous heating , it can offset cooling .",
    "this requires either the source of the turbulent energy or the amount of energy locally accepted by the plasma and converted into turbulent motions to have some knowledge of the cooling rate and to be self - regulating .",
    "+ agns are a natural candidate for providing a self - regulating energy source , whether the stirring is due to agn - driven jets , bubbles , weak shocks / sound waves , gravitational modes and/or cosmic - ray  buoyancy instabilities .",
    "observationally , a large majority of cool - core clusters harbour radio sources at their centres , and the agn energy output inferred from radio - emitting plasma outflows and cavities is often similar to the x - ray cooling rate of the central gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ however , it may not be necessary for the energy source to be fine - tuned or tightly self - regulating .",
    "our scheme for heating the icm can deal with excess turbulent energy via the following two considerations .",
    "first , not all of the power provided by the external stirring has to be locally thermalised via turbulence , as the turbulence may have an effective ` impedance ' and only accept the amount of power that can be locally viscously dissipated without triggering the microinstabilities ; the remaining power could be transported elsewhere .",
    "second , the parallel viscous heating rate ( eq . [ eqn : heating2 ] ) , coupled with the assumption of equipartition kinetic and magnetic energies ( eq . [ eqn : equipartition ] ) , is naturally self - regulating : any increase in turbulent energy implies an increase in magnetic energy , which implies an increased viscous dissipation rate .",
    "both of these regulation mechanisms require there to be a sufficient amount of turbulence to pin the pressure anisotropy at its marginal stability threshold .",
    "as it happens , there seems to be no dearth of turbulent power ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that some of this power can be thermalised via parallel viscous dissipation in a thermally stable way provides an attractive alternative to other heating models that suffer from stability issues .",
    "further work on the excitation and replenishment of turbulence in a weakly collisional icm is clearly needed .",
    "the heating is assumed to be all due to parallel collisional viscosity . in principle",
    ", energy could cascade through the parallel viscous scale and onwards to collisionless scales via alfvnic turbulence and then heat the plasma via microphysical dissipation at the ion and electron larmor scales ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this possibility has been ignored here .",
    "the predicted turbulent velocity , obtained by assuming approximate equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energies , is probably a lower limit on the actual turbulent velocity since @xmath142 is unlikely to be smaller than the alfvn speed .",
    "unfortunately , a more exact estimate of @xmath142 would require a detailed understanding of turbulent dynamo saturation in the icm , far beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "our estimates of the characteristic turbulence scale and turbulent diffusion coefficient are perhaps the more uncertain of our predictions , as they depend on the rate of transfer of energy from the external driving sources into the turbulence .",
    "this encodes what we have referred to above as the effective ` impedance ' of the turbulence , the detailed physics of which is poorly understood .    all these concerns clearly require further theoretical work . however , the fact that our predictions are not too far from current observational estimates or plausible expectations lends us hope that these concerns might be of secondary importance .",
    "while the exact numbers predicted in this paper should be taken with a grain of salt , one can not help being encouraged by the fact that they seem to be quite reasonable without any fine - tuning of adjustable prefactors . the basic conjecture that the saturation of microscale plasma instabilities endows the icm with a thermally stable source of viscous heating seems robust .",
    "if our predictions are confirmed , this would constitute strong evidence that microphysical plasma processes play a decisive role in setting the large - scale structure and evolution of galaxy clusters .",
