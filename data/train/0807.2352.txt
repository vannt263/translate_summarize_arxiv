    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , a typical example of which is a conjecture that type iib superstring on @xmath6 corresponds to @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) , has been intensively investigated for a decade . however , it has not been completely proven yet , partially because it is a strong / weak duality with respect to the coupling constants .",
    "it is , therefore , relevant to give a nonperturbative definition of @xmath0 sym that enables us to study its strong coupling regime .",
    "the lattice gauge theory is a promising candidate for such a nonperturbative definition .",
    "however , supersymmetric gauge theories on the lattice are generally difficult to construct , although there have been remarkable developments on this subject @xcite . to give a nonperturbative definition of @xmath0 sym will not only bring enormous progress in the study of the ads / cft correspondence , but will also yield some insights into the problem of nonperturbative formulation of supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a gauge theory in the planar limit is equivalent to the matrix model ( the reduced model ) obtained by dimensionally reducing it to zero dimension if the @xmath7 symmetry is unbroken , where @xmath8 stands for the dimensionality of space - time .",
    "this is the so - called large @xmath9 reduction .",
    "the global gauge symmetry of the matrix model is naturally interpreted as the local gauge symmetry of the original gauge theory .",
    "thus , as an alternative to the lattice gauge theory , the matrix model may serve as a nonperturbative definition of the planar gauge theory with the gauge symmetry manifestly kept .",
    "the @xmath7 symmetry is , however , spontaneously broken except for @xmath10 , so that the above equivalence does not hold generically .",
    "there have been two improvements of the reduced model in which the @xmath7 symmetry breaking is prevented so that the equivalence holds : one is the quenched reduced model @xcite , and the other is the twisted reduced model @xcite .",
    "these improved models work well for nonsupersymmetric planar gauge theories .",
    "it seems quite difficult to preserve supersymmetry manifestly in the twisted reduced model on the flat space and in the quenched reduced model , while the gauge symmetry is respected in both models .",
    "the compactification in matrix models developed in @xcite shares the same idea with the reduced model and will be called the matrix t - duality in this paper . while it is not restricted to the planar limit",
    ", it requires the size of matrices to be infinite from the beginning for the orbifolding condition to be imposed , so that it can not be used to define any supersymmetric gauge theory nonperturbatively as it stands .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that by imposing an orbifolding condition on the reduced model of a supersymmetric gauge theory , one can obtain its lattice theory in which part of the supersymmetries are manifestly preserved so that the fine - tuning of only a few parameters is required . this construction can be regarded as a finite - size matrix analog of the matrix t - duality .",
    "however , it has a problem of flat directions which is analogous to the problem of the @xmath7 symmetry breaking . to overcome this problem , for instance , one needs to introduce a mass term for the scalar field , which leads to no preservation of supersymmetries .    in @xcite , takayama and",
    "three of the present authors found the relationships among the @xmath11 symmetric theories , which include @xmath0 sym on @xmath12 , 2 + 1 sym on @xmath13 @xcite and the plane wave matrix model ( pwmm ) @xcite .",
    "the last theory is obtained by consistently truncating the kaluza - klein modes of @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 @xcite and so are the former two theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , 2 + 1 sym on @xmath13 and pwmm can be regarded as dimensional reductions of @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 .",
    "these theories possess common features : mass gap , discrete spectrum and many discrete vacua . from the gravity duals of those vacua proposed by lin and maldacena @xcite , the following relations among these theories",
    "are suggested : a ) the theory around each vacuum of 2 + 1 sym on @xmath13 is equivalent to the theory around a certain vacuum of pwmm , and b ) the theory around each vacuum of @xmath0 sym on @xmath12 is equivalent to the theory around a certain vacuum of 2 + 1 sym on @xmath13 with the orbifolding ( periodicity ) condition imposed . in @xcite ,",
    "the relations a ) and b ) were shown directly on the gauge theory side .",
    "the results in @xcite not only serve as a nontrivial check of the gauge / gravity correspondence for the @xmath11 theories , but they are also interesting from the point of view of the reduced model as follows . while there have been many works on realizing the gauge theories on the fuzzy sphere @xcite using matrix models @xcite and on the monopoles on the fuzzy sphere @xcite , the relation a ) shows that the continuum limit of the concentric fuzzy spheres with different radii corresponds to multiple monopoles .",
    "note that realizing the gauge theories on the fuzzy sphere using the matrix models can be viewed as an extension of the twisted reduced model to curved space .",
    "the relation b ) can be regarded as an extension of the matrix t - duality to that on a nontrivial @xmath14 bundle , @xmath15 , whose base space is @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , the matrix t - duality was later extended to that on general @xmath14 bundles in @xcite and on general @xmath17 bundles in @xcite . combining the relations",
    "a ) and b ) leads to the relation c ) , that the theory around each vacuum of @xmath0 sym on @xmath12 is equivalent to the theory around a certain vacuum of pwmm with the orbifolding condition imposed .",
    "in particular , for @xmath18 , @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 is realized in pwmm .",
    "the possibility of defining @xmath0 sym in terms of pwmm nonperturbatively is suggested in @xcite .",
    "the relationships shown in @xcite are classical in the following sense : in the relation a ) , we show the equivalence at tree level and do not care about possible uv / ir mixing at higher orders , although the gravity duals suggest that any uv / ir mixing does not occur . in the relation",
    "b ) , the size of matrices must be infinite from the beginning as in the original matrix t - duality .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a nonperturbative definition of @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 which is equivalently mapped to @xmath0 sym on @xmath19 at the conformal point and possesses the superconformal symmetry , the @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the planar limit . by referring to the relation c ) in @xcite",
    ", we regularize @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 nonperturbatively by using pwmm .",
    "our analysis in this paper is quantum mechanical .",
    "the restriction to the planar limit enables us not to impose the orbifolding condition and to consider finite - size matrices such that the size of matrices plays the role of the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "thus we use an extension of the reduced model to curved space rather than the matrix t - duality to relate @xmath21 sym on @xmath13 to @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 . because pwmm is a massive theory ,",
    "there is no flat direction and the quenching prescription is not needed .",
    "our regularization manifestly preserves the gauge symmetry and the @xmath11 symmetry , a subgroup of the @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "in particular , sixteen supersymmetries among thirty - two supersymmetries are respected in our regularization .",
    "the restriction to the planar limit and sixteen supersymmetries are probably sufficient to suppress the uv / ir mixing which may break the relation between @xmath21 sym on @xmath13 and pwmm quantum mechanically .",
    "they also stabilize the vacua of pwmm completely .",
    "indeed , the gravity duals of these theories suggest @xmath21 sym on @xmath13 is obtained from pwmm quantum mechanically in the continuum limit at least in the planar limit .",
    "the full @xmath20 symmetry should be restored in the continuum limit . by performing the 1-loop analysis and comparing the results with those in continuum @xmath0 sym",
    ", we provide some evidences that our regularization of @xmath0 sym indeed works , although our final goal is to analyze @xmath0 sym nonperturbatively by using our formulation .",
    "our theory still has the continuum time direction , which we need to cope with in order to put our theory on computer .",
    "for instance , we should be able to apply the method in @xcite to our case .",
    "we comment on an interesting paper @xcite , the authors of which constructed the @xmath22 background in the iib matrix model with the myers term using the same procedure as @xcite .",
    "they calculated the free energy of the theory around the background up to the 2-loop order to find the stability of the background .",
    "note also that the authors of @xcite discussed practicality of @xmath0 sym on the lattice recently .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we study the large @xmath9 reduction on a finite volume . as an example , we consider the @xmath23 matrix quantum mechanics .",
    "we examine how the theory on @xmath24 is obtained from the matrix model that is its dimensional reduction to zero dimension , emphasizing the difference between the large @xmath9 reductions for the theories on @xmath25 and @xmath24 . in section 3 , we review the relationships among @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 , 2 + 1 sym on @xmath13 and pwmm shown in @xcite . based on these relationships and the result in section 2 , we give a nonperturbative definition of @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 using pwmm . in section 4 , we perform the 1-loop calculation in our theory to give some evidences that our regularization of @xmath0 sym indeed works .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendices ,",
    "some details are gathered .",
    "in this section , we study the large @xmath9 reduction on a finite volume , focusing on how different it is from that on an infinite volume .",
    "let us consider a matrix quantum mechanics , whose action is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an @xmath28 hermitian matrix .",
    "we take the t hooft limit : @xmath29 .",
    "first , we consider the case in which the theory is defined on @xmath25 , namely @xmath30 .",
    "the prescription of the large @xmath9 reduction is to make the following replacement @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 in the right - hand side of the first equation is no longer dependent on @xmath33 and @xmath34 is an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "@xmath35 is a constant @xmath28 matrix given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we take the limit in which @xmath38 note that @xmath39 is an infrared cutoff . the action ( [ original model ] ) is reduced to @xmath40     ( a ) [ g - afig ]     ( b ) [ g - bfig ]    in order to illustrate the large @xmath9 reduction , we see that the free energy of the original model ( [ original model ] ) agrees with that of the reduced model ( [ reduced model ] ) at the two - loop level .",
    "there are two diagrams at the two - loop level for the free energy .",

    "we evaluate the planar diagram in fig .",

    "1-(a ) for the reduced model : @xmath43 by using the relation valid in the limit ( [ limit for reduced model ] ) , @xmath44 one can easily verify that @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , one can prove that @xmath46 holds at all orders .",
    "we further evaluate the nonplanar diagram in fig .",
    "1-(b ) for the reduced model : @xmath47 note that there is no correspondence for the nonplanar diagram between the original and reduced models .",
    "the nonplanar contribution ( [ nonplanar diagram for the reduced model ] ) is suppressed by the factor @xmath48 in the limit ( [ limit for reduced model ] ) , relative to the planar contribution ( [ planar diagram for the reduced model ] ) .",
    "all the nonplanar contributions are indeed suppressed relative to the planar contributions in the reduced model .",
    "the reduced model therefore reproduces the t hooft ( planar ) limit of the original model .",
    "next , we compactify the @xmath33-direction to @xmath24 with the radius @xmath25 .",
    "we evaluate the planar diagram in fig .",
    "1-(a ) for the original model : @xmath49 where we take the @xmath50 limit with @xmath51 fixed .",
    "note that the nonplanar diagram in fig .",
    "1-(b ) for the original model is still suppressed by @xmath42 relative to the planar diagram in fig .",
    "correspondingly , we consider the reduced model @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "this naive reduced model turns out not to reproduce the original model on @xmath24 .",
    "the contribution of the planar diagram in fig .",
    "1-(a ) to the free energy for this reduced model is @xmath54 while that of the nonplanar diagram in fig .",
    "1-(b ) is @xmath55 ( [ nonplanar diagram for the reduced model for s^1 ] ) is not suppressed relative to ( [ planar diagram for the reduced model for s^1 ] ) , because the infrared cutoff @xmath56 is finite in this case .",
    "thus the correspondence between the original and reduced models fails in this case .    in the following ,",
    "we modify the reduced model ( [ reduced model ] ) to recover the correspondence .",
    "the action of the modified model takes the same form as ( [ reduced model for s^1 ] ) while @xmath32 is a @xmath57 matrix , @xmath58 run from 1 to @xmath59 and @xmath60 is given by the @xmath61-component of the matrix @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a positive even integer .",

    "@xmath63 turns out to play the role of the ultraviolet cutoff for the momentum . in the modified model , the contribution of the planar diagram in fig .",
    "1-(a ) to the free energy is @xmath65 then , we see that @xmath66 .",

    "1-(b ) to the free energy for the modified model is @xmath68 this is suppressed by @xmath42 relative to ( [ planar diagram for modified model ] ) .",
    "all the nonplanar contributions are indeed suppressed relative to the planar contributions in the modified model . hence , the modified model reproduces the t hooft ( planar ) limit of the original model on @xmath24 .    for @xmath8-dimensional pure yang - mills ( ym ) , the reduction analogous to ( [ replacement ] ) leads to @xmath69 ^ 2 { \\nonumber \\\\}&\\rightarrow s_{ym , r}=-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\frac{1}{4g^2}\\mbox{tr}[p_{\\mu}+a_{\\mu},p_{\\nu}+a_{\\nu}]^2 , \\label{reduced model of ym}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the @xmath8-dimensional analogue of ( [ p ] ) .",
