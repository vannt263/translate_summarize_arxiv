    "the broadcast nature of the wireless channel gives rise to many wireless security problems . traditionally , wireless security is guaranteed through high layer encryption . with the development of interception techniques ,",
    "encryption becomes more complex , leading to high computation burden .",
    "thanks to physical layer security measures enlightened by information theory , we may exploit wireless channel characteristics , i.e. , fading and noise , to guarantee secure communications @xcite-@xcite even without encryption .",
    "thus , the heavy dependence on complex higher - layer encryption may be dispensed , leaving more computation resources for communications .",
    "the performance of physical layer security is usually measured by secrecy rate , namely the capacity difference between the legitimate channel ( from the information source to the destination ) and the eavesdropper channel ( from the information source to the eavesdropper ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the introduction of relay into physical layer security can improve the legitimate channel capacity through cooperative diversity , and thus enhances transmission security @xcite-@xcite .",
    "some feasible relaying schemes and their performances were discussed in @xcite .",
    "similar to the traditional relaying systems , amplify - and - forward ( af ) @xcite and decode - and - forward ( df ) @xcite are two commonly used relaying schemes in secure relaying systems .",
    "intuitively , the position of relay has a great impact on the secrecy performance .",
    "some optimization schemes for relay position were presented from the the perspective of minimizing the interception probability in @xcite .",
    "if there are multiple relays , higher performance gains can be obtained by relay selection or cooperation . in @xcite ,",
    "an optimal relay selection scheme was proposed to suppress the interception probability by exploiting selective gain in multiple relay systems .",
    "additionally , multiple relay cooperative beamforming combined with jamming was also adopted to maximize the secrecy rate in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "considering the csi sharing overhead , an iterative distributed precoding was proposed in @xcite to enhance the received signal power at the destination node and to mitigate the signal leakage to the eavesdropper simultaneously .",
    "in fact , if the relay is equipped with multiple antennas , it is likely to enhance the desired signal power and impair the eavesdropper signal quality simultaneously , and thus increase the secrecy rate . in this context ,",
    "multi - antenna relays received considerable attention , and more effective relaying schemes were proposed to optimize the secrecy rate @xcite @xcite .",
    "linear precoding schemes were investigated in a mimo relay network assuming global csi @xcite .",
    "moreover , two precoding schemes based on the idea of information leakage neutralization were proposed to enhance wireless security over the multi - antenna non - regenerative relay assisted multi - carrier interference channel @xcite . however , the quality and availability of the legitimate and eavesdropper csi are two research challenges . due to the fact that there is a feedback delay or error for legitimate channel and the eavesdroppers are usually well hidden , the relay may only have imperfect legitimate csi and no eavesdropper csi . therefore ,",
    "it is impossible to realize absolutely secure communications over the fading channel . to this end , the conception of secrecy outage capacity was adopted to guarantee secure communications with a high probability @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , without the eavesdropper csi , a challenging problem rises when the eavesdropper is close to the transmitter . the so - called _ short - distance interception _",
    "scenario is not yet fully addressed in literature .",
    "even with a multi - antenna relay , the secrecy outage capacity is too small to fulfill the requirement on quality of service ( qos ) , due to the relatively high quality of interception signal .",
    "recently , it is found that large - scale mimo ( ls - mimo ) systems can significantly improve the transmission performance by utilizing its enormous array gain @xcite @xcite . through deploying hundreds of or even more antennas ,",
    "the spatial resolution of the transmit beam can be very high even with just simple linear precoding methods , e.g. , maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) .",
    "then , the information leakage to the eavesdropper can be quite small , and is negligible if the number of antennas approaches infinity @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , the achievable secrecy sum - rate based on regularized channel inversion precoding",
    "was derived for large - scale miso broadcast channels with confidential message . furthermore",
    ", large - scale mimo technology together with artificial noise ( an ) was applied in multicell systems to enhanced wireless security @xcite .",
    "it was shown that even with a low complexity random an shaping scheme , it was possible to provide a favorite performance .",
    "again , the csi at the ls - mimo transmitter has a great impact on the secrecy performance . in general , the csi in ls - mimo is obtained by making use of channel reciprocity of time division duplex ( tdd ) systems . due to duplex delay or pilot contamination , the estimated csi may be imperfect , resulting in inevitable performance loss @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the research on physical layer security based on ls - mimo relaying techniques is just beginning , especially in the case of imperfect csi . in @xcite",
    ", we analyzed the secrecy performance of large - scale mimo relay in two - hop secure communications with imperfect csi , and derived closed - form expressions of secrecy outage capacity for amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) relaying protocols , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we focus on performance analysis and comparison of two classic relaying schemes , including amplify - and - forward ( af ) and the decode - and - forward ( df ) , for physical layer security in an ls - mimo relaying system with imperfect csi .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we are the first to introduce ls - mimo techniques into a relaying system , and solve the challenging problem of short - distance ( relay and eavesdropper ) interception .",
    "we derive explicit expressions of the secrecy outage capacity for both af and df relaying schemes , and compare their performance under different conditions , e.g. the csi accuracy , transmit powers at the source and the relay , and interception distance .",
    "we analyze the asymptotic behavior of secrecy outage capacity under large transmit power , and obtain some insights on the secrecy performance as follows : 1 .",
    "as the transmit power at the source approaches infinity , the secrecy outage capacity for both af and df relaying schemes is upper bounded by the same performance ceiling .",
    "the bound is is invariant with respect to transmit powers , but declines as the interception distance and the outage probability decrease , and increases as the number of antennas at the relay adds .",
    "2 .   as the transmit power at the relay approaches infinity , the secrecy outage capacity of both af and",
    "df relaying schemes tends to zero , but the interception event occurs with probability 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "3 .   under large transmit powers , af is a better choice than df from the perspectives of both secrecy performance and implementation complexity .",
    "both too low and too high relay transmit powers at the relay result in poor secrecy performance .",
    "there exits an optimal transmit power at medium regime that maximizes the secrecy outage capacity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give an overview and system model of the ls - mimo relaying system employing physical layer security in section ii , and then derive the secrecy outage capacities for af and df relaying schemes with imperfect csi , and compare their performance in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we perform asymptotic analysis to obtain several insights on the secrecy performance .",
    "we then present some simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in v. finally , we conclude the whole paper in section vi .",

    "we consider a time division duplex ( tdd ) ls - mimo relaying system , including one source , one destination equipped with a single antenna each and one relay deploying @xmath7 antennas in presence of a passive eavesdropper , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath7 is usually quite large in such an ls - mimo relaying system , i.e. , @xmath8 or greater .",
    "in addition , the eavesdropper is usually a legitimate destination or pretends to be a legitimate destination @xcite , so we consider the eavesdropper is equipped with one antenna , like the destination .",
    "the system works in a half - duplex mode , so the information transmission from the source to the destination with the aid of the ls - mimo relay requires two time slots .",
    "specifically , during the first time slot , the source transmits the signal to the relay , and then the relay forwards the post - processing signal to the destination within the second time slot .",
    "note that the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable due to a long distance .",
    "meanwhile , the eavesdropper monitors the transmission from the relay to the destination , and tries to intercept the signal . in practice , the relay is far away from the source , so it is difficult for the eavesdropper to overhear both the source and the relay .",
    "following previous related literatures @xcite and @xcite , we also assume that the eavesdropper only monitors the relay , since it thought that the signal is from the relay directly .",
    "we use @xmath9 to denote the channel from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 representing the source , the relay , the destination and the eavesdropper , respectively .",

    "@xmath16 remains constant during a relatively long period and @xmath17 fades independently slot by slot .",

    "since there is no knowledge of the eavesdropper channel at the source and relay , it is impossible to maintain a steady secrecy rate over all realizations of the fading channels . in this paper , we take the secrecy outage capacity @xmath36 as the performance metric , which is defined as the maximum achievable rate under the condition that the outage probability of the transmission rate surpasses the secrecy rate is equal to a given value @xmath37 , namely @xmath38",
    "in this section , we concentrate on secrecy performance analysis and comparison of two commonly used relaying techniques , namely af and df , for physical layer security in an ls - mimo relaying system with imperfect csi . in what follows",
    ", we first derive explicit expressions of the secrecy outage capacity related to a given outage probability for the two relaying techniques , and then compare their performance under different channel conditions .      in this case , the relay forwards the signal @xmath39 via multiplying the received signal @xmath23 by a @xmath40 processing matrix @xmath41 , namely @xmath42 we assume the relay has full csi @xmath24 through channel estimation , and gets partial csi @xmath25 by making use of channel reciprocity in tdd systems . due to duplex delay between uplink and downlink , there is a certain degree of mismatch between the estimated csi @xmath43 and the real csi @xmath25 , whose relation can be expressed as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the error noise vector with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean and unit variance complex gaussian entries .",
    "@xmath46 , scaling from 0 to 1 , is the correlation coefficient between @xmath43 and @xmath25 .",
    "a large @xmath46 means better csi accuracy . if @xmath47 , the relay has full csi @xmath25",
    "additionally , due to the hidden property of the eavesdropper , the csi @xmath48 is unavailable .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 is designed only based on @xmath24 and @xmath43 , but is independent of @xmath48 . since maximum ratio combination ( mrc ) and maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) can achieve asymptotically optimal performance in ls - mimo systems with low complexity @xcite @xcite , we design @xmath41 by combining mrc and mrt . specifically , the received signal @xmath23 is first combined with an mrc vector @xmath49 , then normalized by a scaling factor @xmath50 , and finally multiplied by an mrt vector @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , the processing matrix is given by @xmath52 it is assumed that the destination has perfect csi by channel estimation , thus the received signal and the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) can be expressed as @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "based on the received snr in ( [ eqn10 ] ) , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 1 _ : the legitimate channel capacity in an ls - mimo relaying system in presence of imperfect csi can be approximated as @xmath58 when the number of relay antennas is very large , where @xmath59 is a half of the spectral bandwidth .",

    ", the channel capacity from the source to the relay can be expressed as @xmath67 where ( [ eqn13 ] ) holds true because of channel hardening when @xmath68 .",

    "@xmath76    then , given a set of channel conditions and transmit powers , it is easy to choose the better relaying technique according to ( [ eqn18 ] ) .",
    "this result can be explained as follows .",
    "af forwards the noise from the first hop , which not only degrades the performance at the destination , but also impair the quality of the eavesdropper signal .",
    "in particular , at low source snr region , the noise has a greater impact on the eavesdropper signal than the legitimate signal . in this case , the noise is helpful to improve the secrecy performance .",
    "however , for df , the benefit brought be the first hop noise is eliminated through decoding . in other words , decoding for the legitimate receiver is also in the interest of the eavesdropper .",
    "thus , af may outperform df in this case .",
    "af and df have different secrecy performance under various conditions .",
    "thus , we propose to switch the two relaying protocols according to system parameters .",
    "interception probability is the outage probability corresponding to zero secrecy outage capacity . in other words ,",

    "it is also found that af performs better than df at low snr@xmath97 regime , performs poorer at medium snr@xmath97 regime , and has the same performance at high snr@xmath97 regime .",
    "this is because at low snr@xmath97 , the forwarding noise of af may significantly depress the channel capacity from the relay to the destination , and improve the secrecy performance .",
    "but at medium snr@xmath97 , the noise is negligible , so df performs better than af .",
    "therefore , it is better to switch the two relaying schemes according to system parameters , so as to maximize the secrecy outage capacity .",
    "these cross points are the switching points indeed .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    then , we investigate the impact of snr@xmath100 on the secrecy outage capacity of af and df relaying schemes with @xmath98 , @xmath99 and snr@xmath101db . as seen in fig.[fig5 ] , the secrecy outage capacity is a convex function of snr@xmath100 for both af and df . at low and high snr@xmath100 regimes ,",
    "the secrecy outage capacity asymptotically approaches zero , and the maximum secrecy outage capacity appears at medium snr@xmath100 regime , which proves theorem 5 , theorem 7 , and lemma 6 again .",
    "different from the function of snr@xmath97 , af first performs poorer , since af would amplify the noise at the relay .",
    "but , af performs better than df as snr@xmath100 increases , since the channel capacity from the relay to the eavesdropper increases and thus the secrecy outage capacity of df decreases sharply .",
    "hence , it also makes sense to switch the relaying schemes according to system parameters .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    next , we show the impact of snr@xmath97 on the interception probability of af and df relaying schemes with @xmath99 , and snr@xmath95db . it is found from fig.[fig6 ] that af has a zero interception probability in the whole snr@xmath97 region , because it can always support a nonzero rate , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . at high snr@xmath100 regime , the interception probability of both af and df approaches a bound independent of @xmath21 and @xmath27 , which reconfirms the claims in lemma 1 and 7 . in this case , due to a large @xmath102 ,",
    "the bound on the interception probability in ( [ eqn20 ] ) is nearly equal to zero .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we investigate the impact of snr@xmath100 on the interception probability of af and df relaying schemes with snr@xmath101db and @xmath99 . as seen in fig.[fig7 ] ,",
    "similar to the last case , af has a zero interception probability in the whole snr@xmath100 region . as snr@xmath100 increases , the bounds on the interception probability for af and df are 0 and 1 respectively , which proves lemma 2 , lemma 4 , and lemma 8 again .",
    "a major contribution of this paper is the introduction of ls - mimo relaying techniques into physical layer security that leads to significant enhancement of secrecy outage capacity , even when the interception distance is short .",
    "this paper focuses on the analysis and comparison of secrecy outage capacity under af and df relaying schemes , and derives explicit expressions in terms of transmit snrs , csi accuracy , antenna number and interception distance .",
    "furthermore , we carry out asymptotic analysis on the secrecy outage capacity and interception probability and get clear insights from them . altogether , these results provide some important guidelines for the design of ls - mimo relaying schemes for secure communications .",
    "for example , af and df has the same performance at high source transmit power .",
    "it is better to choose af due to the lower complexity .",
    "moreover , there is an optimal relay transmit power at medium regime .",
    "based on the snr @xmath103 at the destination , the achievable legitimated channel rate is given by ( [ app3 ] ) at the top of the next page ,    @xmath104    where @xmath59 is a half of the spectral bandwidth , since a complete transmission requires two time slots .",
    "@xmath105 denotes the real part of @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath25 is replaced by @xmath107 in ( [ app1 ] ) .",
    "( [ app2 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath108 scales with the order @xmath109 as @xmath68 while @xmath110 scales as the order @xmath111 , which can be negligible",
    "( [ app3 ] ) holds true because of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , namely channel hardening @xcite .",
    "therefore , we get the theorem 1 .",
    "according to ( [ eqn5 ] ) , for a given @xmath37 , we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath116 . in order to derive the secrecy outage capacity ,",
    "the key is to get the cdf of @xmath116 . examining ( [ eqn11 ] ) , due to channel hardening , we have @xmath117 since @xmath118 is an isotropic unit vector and independent of @xmath48 , @xmath119 is @xmath120 distributed with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "let @xmath121 , we can derive the cdf of @xmath116 as @xmath122 if @xmath123 , then we have @xmath124 since @xmath125 is impossible when @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 hence , we get the theorem 2 .",
    "in an ls - mimo df relaying system , the eavesdropper channel capacity can be expressed as @xmath128 then , the secrecy outage probability @xmath37 with respect to a secrecy outage capacity @xmath129 can be computed as ( [ app9 ] ) at the top of the next page ,    @xmath130    where ( [ app21 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath131 is @xmath120 distributed with 2 degrees of freedom , and ( [ app9 ] ) holds true since @xmath132 approaches zero when @xmath7 is sufficient large .",
    "based on ( [ app9 ] ) , it is easy to get the theorem 3 .",
    "if @xmath21 is sufficiently large , the secrecy outage capacity with respect to a given outage probability @xmath37 in an ls - mimo af relaying system can be approximated as @xmath133 where ( [ app10 ] ) follows the fact that the terms @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the denominators is negligible when @xmath21 is large enough , and ( [ app11 ] ) holds true since the constant  1 \" is dropper in the case of large @xmath21 . from ( [ app12 ] )",
    ", it is known that the secrecy outage capacity is independent of transmit power @xmath21 and @xmath27 , and reduces as the interception distance and the outage probability decreases , which proves theorem 4 .",
    "in the case of large @xmath27 , the secrecy outage capacity with respect to a given outage probability @xmath37 in an ls - mimo af relaying system can be approximated as @xmath136 where ( [ app13 ] ) follows the fact that the terms @xmath137 and @xmath135 in the denominators is negligible when @xmath27 is large enough , and ( [ app14 ] ) holds true since the constant  1 \" is dropper in the case of large @xmath27 . from ( [ app15 ] )",
    ", it is found that the secrecy outage capacity is always equal to zero with arbitrary transmit powers @xmath21 and @xmath27 , interception distance and outage probability , which proves theorem 5 .",
    "if @xmath21 is sufficiently large , the secrecy outage capacity with respect to a given outage probability @xmath37 in an ls - mimo df relaying system can be computed as @xmath138 where ( [ app16 ] ) follows the fact of @xmath139 at a large @xmath21 . from ( [ app17 ] ) , it is found that the secrecy outage capacity is independent of @xmath21 , and declines as the interception distance the outage probability decrease .",

    "interestingly , it is found that df has the same secrecy outage capacity as af , which proves the claims in theorem 6 .",
