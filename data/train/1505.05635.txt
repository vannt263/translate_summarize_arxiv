    "considered here is a technique to generate numerically periodic traveling wave solutions of nonlinear wave equations of the form @xmath0 in ( [ ptw1 ] ) @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a smooth function ( typically a polynomial ) with @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a dispersion operator with fourier symbol @xmath5 , @xmath6 being @xmath7 the fourier transform of @xmath8 at @xmath9 . equation ( [ ptw1 ] ) appears as a first one - dimensional , unidirectional approach for nonlinear dispersive wave propagation , see e.  g. @xcite and particular cases are remarkable : korteweg de vries - type equation ( kdv , @xmath10 ) , benjamin - ono - type equation ( bo , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the hilbert transform , @xmath13 ) or benjamin - type equation ( bo , @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the paper is concerned with the numerical generation of periodic traveling wave solutions of the models ( [ ptw1 ] ) .",
    "they are solutions of the form @xmath16 whic are periodic of some period @xmath17 and travel with speed @xmath18 .",
    "results on existence and stability of such solutions for particular cases of ( [ ptw1 ] ) can be seen in the literature ( see e.  g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite , chen and bona extablished existence of periodic traveling wave solutions of ( [ ptw1 ] ) under some hypotheses on @xmath19 and @xmath4 ( see below ) as well as stability under perturbations of the same period .",
    "this study generalizes previous works on this matter , @xcite .    in @xcite a numerical scheme for the numerical generation of periodic traveling waves of ( [ ptw1 ] )",
    "was proposed .",
    "this was based on a fourier pseudospectral discretization in space of ( [ ptw1 ] ) along with time integration with conservation properties of invariant quantities of the periodic value problem associated to ( [ ptw1 ] ) .",
    "the periodic traveling wave profile was approximated by using the iterative petviashvili method , @xcite .",
    "the resulting scheme ensured an accurate computation of two characteristic elements of the waves , the initial profile and the speed .",
    "the present work attempts to complete @xcite in two main points , not totally resolved there in the authors opinion .",
    "the first one is that the generation of the profile of the periodic traveling wave solution may involve some nonzero constants which make the petviashvili method , at least initially , unable to be used .",
    "the second one , somehow related , is that this method is not well suited to nonlinearities @xmath19 in ( [ ptw1 ] ) with more than one homogeneous terms of different degrees ( like a polynomial for example ) .    in order to overcome these drawbacks",
    ", the present work introduces an improved algorithm from the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "the strategy is based on a change of variable suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to treat the constants ( to solve the first problem above described ) and the use of extended versions of the petviashvili method introduced in @xcite that allows the presence of more general nonlinearities in the model ( to solve the second problem ) .",
    "the structure is as follows . in section [ se2 ] some hypotheses on ( [ ptw1 ] ) ( considered in @xcite )",
    "are assumed and the proposed algorithm is decribed .",
    "the efficiency of the method is checked in section [ se3 ] by considering the periodic traveling wave computation for two models .",
    "the first one is the generalized fractional kdv equation ( of the form ( [ ptw1 ] ) with @xmath20 ) , @xcite . the second model is the e - boussinesq system , @xcite .",
    "this is not of the form ( [ ptw1 ] ) but its presence here is justified as an attempt to extend the application of the method is based to more general situations , in particular to some nonlinear dispersive systems . in both cases and to our knowledge , many of the profiles are generated for the first time ; in particular , for the case of the e - boussinesq system , we do not even know if some theoretical results of existence of periodic traveling wave solutions for the model are available ( although they may be expected from the existence of solitary wave solutions as their large wavelength limit , @xcite ) . section [ se4 ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we make the following assumptions about ( [ ptw1 ] ) :    * the nonlinear term @xmath19 is a polynomial of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 . * @xmath23 is real , even , continuous with @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 then there exists @xmath26 such that @xmath27 * there exists @xmath28 such that @xmath29    these are some of the hypotheses considered in @xcite and will be adopted here with the aim of ensuring the existence of periodic traveling wave solutions in the following sense ( see @xcite for details ) : for a sufficiently large period parameter @xmath30 the profiles @xmath31 are obtained as minimizers of constrained variational problems involving momentum and energy functionals for ( [ ptw1 ] ) .",
    "then for each minimizer @xmath31 one can find a positive speed @xmath32 such that ( [ ptw3 ] ) is an infinitely smooth traveling wave solution of ( [ ptw1 ] ) which is also stable under perturbations of the same period . in @xcite",
    "the authors also study the large wavelength limit @xmath33 of the periodic traveling waves determining under some additional hypotheses the convergence to solitary wave solutions .",
    "a comment in @xcite is the starting point to introduce our numerical strategy to generate numerically periodic traveling wave profiles .",
    "when @xmath34 in ( [ ptw3 ] ) is a solution of ( [ ptw1 ] ) then the profile @xmath31 must satisfy @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a ( nonzero in general ) constant .",
    "then our method is based on the following steps :    * finding ( approximate or exact ) real constants solutions @xmath37 of ( [ ptw5 ] ) that is @xmath38 ( note that @xmath39 since @xmath24 is assumed in ( h2 ) . )",
    "this means that @xmath40 must be a root of the polynomial @xmath41 * the change of variables @xmath42 , when @xmath31 is a solution of ( [ ptw5 ] ) along with ( [ ptw6 ] ) lead to the following equation for @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 * equation ( [ ptw7 ] ) is iteratively solved with a extended version of the petviashvili method , @xcite . writing @xmath46 and from @xmath47}\\neq 0 $ ] and for @xmath48 the following iteration is considered : @xmath49}&=&\\sum_{j=2}^{p-1}s_{j}(\\varphi^{[\\nu]})n_{j}(\\varphi^{[\\nu ] } ) , \\nu=0,1,\\ldots,\\label{ptw8}\\\\ s_{j}(u)&=&s(u)^{\\alpha_{j}},\\quad s(u)=\\left(\\frac{\\langle \\widetilde{l}(c)u , u\\rangle}{\\langle n(u),u\\rangle}\\right),\\label{ptw9}\\\\ & & \\quad \\alpha_{j}=\\frac{{j}}{{j}-1},\\quad j=2,\\ldots , p-1,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factors @xmath50 in ( [ ptw9 ] ) are obtained by using the same quotient @xmath51 but changing the exponent @xmath52 .",
    "formulas ( [ ptw8 ] ) , ( [ ptw9 ] ) correspond to an extension of the classical petviashvili scheme for nonlinearities with several homogeneous terms but different degree of homogeneity .",
    "this belongs to a more general family , described in @xcite .",
    "the use of ( [ ptw8 ] ) , ( [ ptw9 ] ) instead of other alternatives presented in the literature ( of newton - type , for example ) is justified by the attempt to simplify the implementation of the iterative techniques for the profiles with an easily implementable fixed point type algorithm , @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of convergence , @xmath53})\\rightarrow 1 $ ] .",
    "the operator ( [ ptw2 ] ) taking part of @xmath54 in ( [ ptw7 ] ) suggests to consider the implementation of ( [ ptw8 ] ) , ( [ ptw9 ] ) in fourier space for the fourier coefficients @xmath55}}_{n } , n\\in \\mathbb{z}$ ] of the iterations @xmath56 } , \\nu=0,1,\\ldots$ ] then for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath30 the problem ( [ ptw5 ] ) on @xmath57 with periodic boundary conditions is considered and ( [ ptw8 ] ) , ( [ ptw9 ] ) take the form @xmath58}}_{n}&=&\\frac{1}{c_{s}+\\alpha\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{l}\\right)-f^{\\prime}(c ) } \\sum_{j=2}^{p-1}s_{j}(\\varphi^{[\\nu]})\\widehat{\\left(n_{j}(\\varphi^{[\\nu]})\\right)_{n}}\\label{ptw8b}\\\\   & & n\\in \\mathbb{z},\\quad \\nu=0,1,\\ldots,\\nonumber \\\\ s_{j}(u)&=&\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{z } } ( c_{s}+\\alpha\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{l}\\right)-f^{\\prime}(c))|\\widehat{u}_{n}|^{2}}{\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{z } } \\widehat{\\left(n(u)\\right)}_{n}\\overline{\\widehat{u}}_{n}}\\right)^{\\alpha_{j}},\\label{ptw9b } \\\\ & & \\quad j=2,\\ldots , p-1,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , we note that the existence results in @xcite are mentioned here in connection with the hypotheses ( h1)-(h3 ) .",
    "however , the strategy for the numerical generation uses a different argument , in the sense that it previously fixes a speed @xmath32 whose associated profile is attempted to be computed . in this sense , the point of view of the resolution is closer to other existence results presented in the literature , @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to illustrate the behaviour of the algorithm to generate numerically periodic traveling waves .",
    "this will be shown by considering two models : a generalized version of the fractional kdv equation and the extended boussinesq system .",
    "it may be worth making first some brief comments on the implementation of ( [ ptw8 ] ) , ( [ ptw9 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , due to the nonlocal operator ( [ ptw2 ] ) , a natural way to approximate ( [ ptw7 ] ) consists of a discretization on an interval with a fourier pseudospectral method as in @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "this allows to implement the iteration by using the discrete fourier version of ( [ ptw8b ] ) , ( [ ptw9b ] ) and fft techniques .",
    "secondly , in some of the experiments , the resulting scheme has been complemented with vector extrapolation methods to accelerate the convergence .",
    "the literature on these methods is abundant ( see e.  g. @xcite and references therein ) and their use in traveling wave simulations is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the first example treated here concerns the generation of periodic traveling waves of fractional kdv models of the form @xmath59 which corresponds to ( [ ptw1 ] ) with @xmath60 , being @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 . existence and stability of periodic traveling wave solutions are analyzed in @xcite by using variational arguments .",
    "specifically , existence is obtained for @xmath64 where @xmath65 as far as stability is concerned , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 then the periodic traveling wave is    * spectrally stable if @xmath68 and @xmath69 . * spectrally unstable if @xmath70 or @xmath68 when @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath72 then for @xmath73 there are @xmath74 such that small amplitude periodic traveling waves are spectrally stable for @xmath75 and spectrally unstable for @xmath76 .    in this case step [ s1 ] of the algorithm requires the computation of constant solutions @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 existence of real solutions of ( [ ptw11 ] ) requires some relations involving the parameters @xmath79 ( but not @xmath80 ) . from the constant @xmath40 of ( [ ptw11 ] ) the equation ( [ ptw7 ] ) takes the form @xmath81 the behaviour of the algorithm is illustrated here by fixing @xmath82 and two values for @xmath23 and @xmath83 : @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in both cases ,",
    "the convergence was accelerated by using the minimal polynomial extrapolation method ( mpe ) , @xcite . the approximate profile along with the corresponding phase portrait , are shown in figures [ figptw1](a),(b ) and [ figptw2](a),(b ) , respectively .",
    "figures [ figptw1](c),(d ) and [ figptw2](c),(d ) check the accuracy by displaying two types of errors as functions of the number of iterations :    * the residual error ( in euclidean norm ) @xmath86}-n(\\varphi^{[\\nu]})||,\\quad \\nu=0,1,\\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * the discrepancy between the sequence of stabilizing factors @xmath87})$ ] and ( in case of convergence ) its limit one @xmath88      the second example attempts the application of the method to systems of the form ( [ ptw1 ] ) .",
    "specifically we consider the so - called e - boussinesq system @xmath89 equations ( [ ptw13a ] ) , ( [ ptw13b ] ) appear as a model for the bidirectional propagation of an interfacial wave @xmath90 between two fluid layers with @xmath91 standing for the horizontal velocity of the flow .",
    "the constants are defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are , respectively , the ( dimensionless ) density and depth ratios while @xmath95 is related to the physical depth below and above the unperturbed interface and is taken within the range @xmath96 .",
    "the model is described in detail in @xcite , where the propagation and collision of solitary waves and fronts are also studied numerically . to our knowledge existence of periodic traveling wave solutions",
    "has not been analyzed ( theoretically or numerically ) .",
    "suggested here is some numerical evidence of such waves by using the method described in section [ se2 ] .",
    "note first that periodic traveling waves @xmath97 of ( [ ptw13a ] ) , ( [ ptw13b ] ) of speed @xmath32 must satisfy the system for the profiles @xmath98 for some integration constants @xmath99 .",
    "the search for constant solutions @xmath100 of ( [ ptw14 ] ) leads to the algebraic system @xmath101 in such a way that if @xmath102 then @xmath103 while @xmath104 must be a root of the polynomial @xmath105 finally , the system for the differences @xmath106 is of the form @xmath107 \\begin{pmatrix } \\widetilde{\\eta}\\\\\\widetilde{w } \\end{pmatrix}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = - \\begin{pmatrix } d_{5}c_{2}\\widetilde{\\eta}^{2 } + \\widetilde{w}\\widetilde{\\eta}(-d_{4}+d_{5}\\widetilde{\\eta})+d_{5}\\widetilde{w}\\widetilde{\\eta}^{2}\\\\ \\widetilde{w}^{2}(-\\frac{d_{4}}{2}+d_{5}\\widetilde{\\eta})+2d_{5}c_{2}\\widetilde{w}\\widetilde{\\eta } + d_{5}\\widetilde{w}^{2}\\widetilde{\\eta } \\end{pmatrix}.\\label{ptw15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , as mentioned in section [ se2 ] , system ( [ ptw15 ] ) is iteratively solved for @xmath108 and approximate periodic traveling wave profiles for the values @xmath99 are obtained from the formulas @xmath109 .    in",
    "@xcite a maximum wave velocity @xmath110 is derived and solitary waves are characterized by wave velocities larger than one .",
    "we illustrate the performance of the method by generating periodic traveling waves with a speed close to @xmath111 ( specifically @xmath112 in the experiments below ) and two different values for @xmath113 and the constants @xmath99 .",
    "( in both experiments @xmath114 has been fixed . )",
    "the first case , figure [ figptw3 ] , corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ figptw3](a ) shows the approximate @xmath116 profiles ( also obtained by using additional acceleration with the mpe method ) and the periodic character is confirmed by the phase portrait of @xmath117 in figure [ figptw3](b ) .",
    "the accuracy of the computation is again evaluated in figures [ figptw3](c ) and [ figptw3](d ) with the behaviour of the errors ( [ fsec32 ] ) and ( [ fsec33 ] ) with respect to the number of iterations .",
    "the same information is provided in figure [ figptw4 ] for the case @xmath118 .",
    "note here that the periodic form of the approximate @xmath117 profile is different and closer to the table - top  form of the solitary waves shown in @xcite .",
    "this suggests the connection between these periodic profiles and some associated solitary wave in the limit of large wavelength , @xcite .",
    "in this paper an iterative technique to generate periodic traveling wave solutions of some nonlinear dispersive wave equations is proposed .",
    "the method is based on a suitable change of variable to avoid the presence of some constants of integration in the problem and the application of fixed point iteration of petviashvili type , @xcite .",
    "this strategy overcomes two difficulties not totally solved in some previous algorithms , @xcite , for this purpose , namely :    * the presence of constants that prevents the use of petviashvili type methods , which have been shown to be an alternative to compute solitary wave solutions for the models under study ( see @xcite and references therein ) . *",
    "the presence of nonlinearities of polynomial type with homogeneous terms of different degree , for which the construction of the petviahsvili type methods is not suitable .",
    "the scheme has been illustrated by computing periodic traveling waves in two problems of additional interest : the generalized fractional kdv equation and the extended boussinesq system . in the first case , existence and stability of periodic traveling waves",
    "have been studied theoretically but , to the authors knowledge , no approximate profiles have been computed .",
    "the second example attempts to extend the application of the technique to some nonlinear dispersive systems and suggests the formation of periodic traveling waves in the model , for which ( again to the authors knowledge ) there are no existence results .",
