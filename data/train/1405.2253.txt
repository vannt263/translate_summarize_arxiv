    "the exclusive production of @xmath3 mesons in proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering has recently attracted some interest @xcite .    in an early paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the exclusive production of @xmath3 at the tevatron is sensitive to the @xmath0 scattering in the similar region of energy as measured at hera @xcite .",
    "given that fact the measured cross section for @xmath0 was parametrized and used in that calculation .",
    "our predictions there could be successfully confronted with the tevatron data @xcite and good agreement was achieved @xcite .",
    "the formalism proposed in @xcite and used in @xcite allows to calculate fully differential distributions for the three - body reaction in the broad range of four - dimensional phase space .",
    "the formalism proposed in @xcite allows to test unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugdfs ) in the proton provided the quark - antiquark wave function of the meson is known .",
    "the experimental data for production of different vector mesons prefer gaussian light - cone wave function @xcite .    recently also the lhcb collaboration measured rapidity distributions of the @xmath3 meson but rather in semi - exclusive reaction @xcite . using some theoretical input from ref.@xcite",
    "the lhcb collaboration tried to extract the cross for the @xmath0 reaction at unprecedently high energies not available before at hera , the procedure proposed uses some assumption which are only approximate and need further verification . very recently",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite tried to use the pseudo - data to achieve information on integrated gluon distribution in very small @xmath5 ( longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the gluon ) region , not available earlier at electron machines .",
    "the formalism applied in ref.@xcite uses a slightly simplified collinear formalism where the quark - antiquark wave function is replaced by a normalization constant @xcite . in this formalism only rapidity distribution was discussed .",
    "in contrast to the collinear approach the @xmath6-factorization approach allows to study the complete kinematically reaction . in the present analysis we shall show how some ugdfs from the literature compare to the lhcb data @xcite .",
    "we leave the inclusion of the inelastic contribution as well as a possible fitting of ugdf for further sudies . compared to other calculations in the literature",
    "we include here not only the spin - conserving coupling but also the spin - flip one .",

    "finally , the total cross section for diffractive @xmath3 photoproduction on the nucleon can be calculated from : @xmath24",
    "we include the fermi - motion of quark and antiquark in the bound - state by means of the light - cone wave function of the vector meson .",
    "while the light - cone wave function @xmath25 is written as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath26 of the quark and the relative transverse momentum @xmath27 of quarks in the bound state , in fact it depends only on the relative momentum @xmath28 of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the rest frame of the meson given by @xmath31 following quite literally the approach of @xcite we use as an ansatz for the wave function dependence on @xmath28 : @xmath32 this functional dependence is obviously inspired by the harmonic - oscillator potential , notice however that following @xcite we keep @xmath33 which would be equal in the strict harmonic oscillator potential as free parameters .",
    "the parameters are fixed from the leptonic decay widths of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as well as from the orthonormality conditions of the @xmath34 bound states . recently a number of theoretical arguments for an effectively harmonic confinement potential on the light - front from various approaches have been given in @xcite .",
    "let us stress that an account of the wave function is important to make predictions for the production of excited charmonium states . while we use the momentum space formulation of diffractive vector meson production ,",
    "the equivalent color - dipole formulation is more intuitive to understand the argument : it is the overlap of the light - cone wave functions of photon and vector meson which controls the effective dipole size distributions that enter the dipole cross section @xcite . here",
    "especially the node in the wave function of the radial excitation has a subtle effect on the energy dependence @xcite .",
    "often an extreme nonrelativistic limit is adopted , in which heavy quarks are assumed to be at rest in the meson rest frame , and hence the momentum dependence of the wave function is neglected .",
    "typically then also the transverse momentum of gluons is integrated out @xcite , and the diffractive amplitude becomes proportional to the integrated glue of the target .",
    "strictly speaking in such an approximation one can not predict the energy dependence of @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 production , as to the accuracy of @xcite it is illegitimate to differentiate between @xmath35 , the invariant mass of the @xmath13 pair , @xmath36 , or the bound - state mass @xmath37 , either of which could enter the hard scale .",
