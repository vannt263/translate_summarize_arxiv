    "the goal of this paper is to classify up to isomorphism a certain class of schubert varieties within partial flag manifolds of type @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath7 is a subset of the squares on an @xmath8 chessboard , and a _ @xmath9-rook placement _ on @xmath7 is a subset of @xmath9 squares in @xmath7 , no two in a single row or column .",
    "kaplansky and riordan @xcite considered the problem of when two boards @xmath10 are _ rook - equivalent _ , that is , when for each @xmath11 , the number @xmath12 of @xmath9-rook placements is the same as @xmath13 .",
    "foata and schtzenberger  @xcite solved the problem for the well - behaved subclass of _ ferrers boards _",
    "@xmath2 ; these are the usual ferrers diagrams associated to partitions @xmath14 having all squares left - justified in their row , with @xmath15 squares in the bottom row , @xmath16 in the next , etc .",
    "they showed that each rook - equivalence class of ferrers boards has a unique representative which is a _ strict _ partition , i.e. , satisfying @xmath17 .",
    "goldman , joichi and white  @xcite re - proved this result by showing that @xmath2 and @xmath18 are rook - equivalent if and only if the multisets of integers @xmath19 and @xmath20 coincide .",
    "garsia and remmel  @xcite defined _ @xmath21-rook polynomials _ @xmath22 that @xmath21-count the @xmath9-rook placements on @xmath2 by a certain `` inversion '' statistic generalizing inversions of permutations .",

    "ding observed that the schubert cell structure inherited by @xmath0 has cells indexed by @xmath26-rook placements on @xmath2 , and with the dimension of the cell governed by garsia and remmel s inversion statistic . since these cells are all even - dimensional , their ( co)homology is free abelian , occurring only in even dimension , and the poincar series of @xmath37 is given by the @xmath21-rook polynomial formula .",
    "from this ding concluded @xcite that two partition varieties @xmath38 have _ additively _ isomorphic ( co)homology groups if and only if @xmath2 and @xmath18 are rook - equivalent .",

    "it should be compared with the result of goldman , joichi and white @xcite , which can now be rephrased : the varieties @xmath0 are determined up to additive ( co-)homology isomorphism by the multisets of numbers @xmath58 .",
    "[ main - theorem ] the following are equivalent for two partitions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 :    1 .",

    "the three sections that follow are the technical heart of the paper , categorizing elements in @xmath67 of minimal nilpotence order .",
    "we begin in section  [ gb - section ] by setting up some grbner basis machinery that we shall use throughout ( for a general reference on grbner basis theory , see  @xcite ) .",
    "section  [ g / b - section ] deals with nilpotents in the cohomology of the complete flag variety ( that is , when @xmath1 is a square ferrers board ) and section  [ general - nilpotence - section ] treats the case of arbitrary @xmath0 . using these tools",
    ", we prove in section  [ indecomposable ] that an indecomposable partition @xmath1 may be recovered from the structure of @xmath3 as a graded @xmath68-algebra .",
    "finally , in section  [ decomposable ] , we show that in the general case , @xmath3 has an essentially unique decomposition as a tensor product of graded @xmath68-algebras , whose factors correspond to the indecomposable components of the partition @xmath1 .",
    "it is curious that this unique tensor decomposition fails if instead of the integer cohomology ring @xmath3 one takes cohomology with coefficients in a ring where @xmath69 is invertible ; see remark  [ invertible-2 ] below .",
    "for the sake of completeness , and also to collect facts for future use , we begin by re - proving some of ding s results from @xcite , and re - derive somewhat more directly the presentation given in  @xcite for the cohomology ring of @xmath0 . throughout this paper ,",

    "it is not hard to verify that the permutations @xmath35 obtained in this way are exactly those which are _ 312-avoiding _ ; that is , there do not exist @xmath89 for which @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "equivalently , the cohomology class @xmath36 \\in h^*(x_{n^n})$ ] is represented by a schubert polynomial which is a single monomial , namely the schubert polynomial indexed by the dominant ( or 132-avoiding ) permutation @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the unique permutation of maximal length .",
    "( we thank ezra miller for discussions clarifying these points . )",
    "because @xmath0 is a schubert variety , it comes equipped with a schubert cell decomposition , having cells in only even real dimensions .",
    "as observed by ding , this has important consequences :    [ dings - thm ] the integral cohomology ring @xmath3 is free abelian ( that is , it has no torsion ) , is nonzero only in even homological degrees , and has poincar series @xmath94_q.\\ ] ]    the cohomology is free abelian and concentrated in even degrees because the schubert cell decomposition for the schubert variety @xmath0 has cells only in even dimensions .    for the assertion about the poincar series , we will induct on @xmath26 .",
    "the map @xmath95 is an ( algebraic ) fiber bundle , with fiber isomorphic to @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the partition obtained by removing the first row and column from @xmath1 ( see figure  [ nu - example ] ) .",
    "the leray - serre spectral sequence is particularly simple in this situation , because both base and fiber are simply - connected ( again due to the schubert cell decomposition ) and have homology concentrated in even dimension .",
    "this causes the spectral sequence to degenerate at the @xmath98-page , yielding @xmath99 the assertion about @xmath100 now follows by induction on @xmath26 , using the fact that @xmath28_q = { \\mathop{\\rm poin}\\nolimits } ( { { \\mathbb p}}^{m-1}_{{\\mathbb c } } , q)$ ] .",

    "furthermore , the surjection @xmath115 which forgets the subspaces of dimension greater than @xmath26 in a complete flag induces a map @xmath116 which turns out to be injective , and the image of @xmath117 is identified with the invariant subring @xmath118 .",

    "this ring map is surjective , because @xmath0 inherits from @xmath31 a decomposition into schubert cells , and the dual cocycles to these ( even - dimensional ) cells additively generate the cohomology in each case .",
