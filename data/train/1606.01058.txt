    "we have considered scattering via a fermion or @xmath5 loop ( the so - called box mechanisms ) as well as a nonperturbative mechanism of fluctuation of both photons into vector mesons and their subsequent interaction .    the second mechanism , which involves the reggeon and pomeron exchanges between vector mesons , leads to a rising elastic @xmath6 cross section ( see also @xcite for the related @xmath7 final state ) .",

    "the hadronic pomeron exchange contribution may dominate over the box mechanisms only at high subsystem energies , when the large contribution from the fermion boxes has died out , which means large rapidity distances between photons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "here we consider another mechansism which gives rise to a flat cross section at high @xmath6 center of mass energy : the exchange of two gauge bosons between fermion - loops . in practice",
    "we restrict ourselves to the dominant two - gluon exchange contribution .    formally",

    "its contribution to the elastic scattering of photons at high energies has been first considered in the pioneering work @xcite . indeed in the limit where the mandelstam variables of the @xmath1 process satisfy @xmath9 , major simplifications occur and the three - loop process becomes tractable .",
    "this corresponds to a near - forward , small - angle , scattering of photons .    in our treatment",
    ", we go beyond the early work @xcite by including finite fermion masses , as well as the full momentum structure in the loops , and we consider all helicity amplitudes .",
