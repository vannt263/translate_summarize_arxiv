    "[ fgcncp ] in the previous paragraph , in particular considering the possibility to estimate the surface properties of real nuclei using the value of @xmath19 , we made a minor modification in the dit code of tassan - got @xcite by scaling the transfer probabilities by the exponential factors    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a free parameter ( due to essentially a boltzman factor structure , possibly representing an inverse statistical temperature ) and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 represent the differences of neutron and proton separation energies for the projectile and target calculated using the experimental @xcite and liquid - drop @xcite masses , thus expressing the effect of the microscopic structure .",
