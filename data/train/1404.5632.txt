    "in recent years a lot of attention has been devoted to understanding of the physics of saturation @xcite .",
    "theoretical developments of the last 15 - 20 years have put this activity squarely on the first principle qcd foundations @xcite .",
    "the saturation regime in hadronic scattering is qualitatively different from the simple parton model paradigm , and it would be extremely interesting to find clear signals of it in observed data .",
    "its tell tale sign is the appearance of a dimensional saturation scale in a dense system of gluons ( the color glass condensate ) , which should dominate many bulk observables .",
    "several pieces of experimental data at hera @xcite , rhic @xcite and the lhc @xcite have been indeed interpreted in the framework of saturation ideas , see also refs.@xcite and references therein . however , one still can not point definitively to an experimental verification of the saturation phenomenon .",
    "it is therefore important to understand what other observables can be sensitive to saturation @xcite , and in particular to the existence of the saturation momentum .",
    "one aspect of saturation that has been discussed at length in recent literature , is its impact on particle correlations in the final state .",
    "this includes the effect on the ridge - like correlations in rapidity and azimuthal angle @xcite , as well as decorrelation effect in forward dihadron @xcite , photon - hadron @xcite and drell - yan lepton - pair - jet @xcite productions in high - energy proton - proton ( p+p ) and proton - nucleus ( p+a ) collisions . in this paper",
    "we continue the study of saturation effects on particle correlation .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate diphoton azimuthal angular correlations at forward rapidity .",
    "the mechanism of diphoton production in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) saturation framework is somewhat different than that of dihadron production .",
    "soft gluons are scattered out of the projectile wave function by directly scattering on a saturated target , and via subsequent hadronization produce hadrons .",
    "photons on the other hand do not scatter themselves , but rather decohere from the scattered quarks .",
    "it is thus interesting to see whether saturation has any discernible effects on the correlations between produced photons .    in terms of theoretical description",
    ", there are clear advantages to studying prompt diphoton production as compared to dihadron production . for final state photons",
    "the difficulties involved with description of hadronization of final state quarks and gluons do not arise . for hadronic final states this stage of the process",
    "is usually described in terms of fragmentation functions , and this description is valid only at high transverse momentum .",
    "additionally , one does not need to be concerned with possible initial state - final state interference effects which are present for hadron production . within the cgc framework , the theoretical understanding of observables necessary to describe diphoton production is more robust . unlike description of dihadron correlations , which necessitates the knowledge of correlators of a higher number of wilson lines , the diphoton production cross section depends only on the dipole amplitude , which is the best understood observable in terms of high energy evolution .    the diphoton production in proton - proton and",
    "antiproton - proton collisions has been intensively investigated in literature , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "precise theoretical understanding of the diphoton production in the standard model provides valuable guidance for the higgs boson signal @xcite . in the present paper , for the first time",
    ", we investiage diphoton production in high - energy proton - nucleus collisions . we obtain the prompt diphoton cross - section in the leading logarithmic approximation in terms of fragmentation and direct contributions , where the fragmentation part is given in terms of single - photon and double - photon fragmentation functions .",

    "ii we derive the basic formulae for calculating the cross - section of semi - inclusive diphoton+jet and inclusive diphoton production in high - energy proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions in the cgc framework .",

    "are systematically re - summed incorporating high gluon density effects at small x and for large nuclei @xcite . in sec .",

    ". we will later quantify uncertainties associated with the freedom to choose a different scale @xmath138 .",
    "for the patron distributions , we will use the nlo mstw pdfs @xcite . for numerical computation , we focus here at low transverse momenta of the produced photon pair at the lhc at forward rapidities , consistent with the soft approximation employed for obtaing the cross - section .",
    "note that this kinematics is mostly relevant for probing saturation effects .    in the standard perturbative calculations",
    "the leading contribution to the diphoton production comes from the annihilation diagram .",
    "this process produces back to back photon pairs , and thus leads to strong peak in the correlation at @xmath139 .",
    "this contribution is absent in the cgc approach , since the dense target wave function is dominated by gluons . in the cgc framework",
    "the annihilation contribution only appears in the next order in @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the fragmentation diphoton to have a non - negligible correlation peaked at @xmath140 .",
    "the reason is that the photon - quark fock component of the incoming quark has zero transverse momentum in the collinear factorization approach .",
    "therefore if momentum transfer from the target is small enough , the photon collinear to the outgoing quark , and the photon emerging from the initial photon - quark state will have opposite transverse momenta , leading to back - to - back correlation .",
    "the direct diphoton part on the other hand , is restricted to kinematics where the transverse momentum of the outgoing quark jet is relatively large @xmath141 .",
    "one therefore does not expect significant back - to - back correlation in the direct photon contribution and also expects that the correlations in the direct part should be more sensitive to the fragmentation scale . reducing the scale @xmath138 should enhance the back - to - back correlations for the direct diphoton .    indeed , our numerical results shown in follow these expectations .",
    "note that because of the convolution with fragmentation and parton distribution functions the partonic level correlation gets somewhat smeared out . in",

    "the fragmentation contribution is less sensitive to the choice of fragmentation / factorization scale while the correlations in the direct diphoton are affected by this uncertainty .",
    "this is easy to understand , since the fragmentation / factorization scale that appears in the ff and the pdf of fragmentation cross - section in mainly cancels between the numerator and the denominator in the correlation defined in .",
    "this does not happen in the direct part since the fragmentation scale appears as the lower limit of integral in the cross - section .    in",
    ", we also compare the correlations of direct , fragmentation and prompt ( fragmentation+direct ) diphoton production at fixed kinematics at the lhc in proton - nucleus collisions for two different fragmentation / factorization scales .",
    "one notes that the back - to - back correlation is larger in the fragmentation part , while the total ( and near - side ) direct diphoton cross - section is larger than the fragmentation one . as a result ,",
    "the total prompt diphoton signal ( the sum of direct and fragmentation parts ) exhibits a reduced back - to - back correlation defined via .",
    "however , with isolation cut technique @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) , one can in principle isolate the fragmentation diphoton contribution and study this correlation separately .",
    "note also that by default , the back - to - back correlation is significantly larger in the two single - photon fragmentation than double - photon fragmentation part , see .    in , we show the rapidity dependence of the fragmentation and prompt ( direct+fragmentation ) diphoton correlation @xmath131 defined in at fixed transverse momenta of the produced diphoton in minimum - bias proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc energy @xmath128 tev .",
    "the back - to - back correlations are systematically suppressed at forward rapidities ( larger @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) in both fragemtation and prompt ( and direct ) diphoton production .    given that the correlation in the direct diphoton production is small ( see figs.[dir1],[frag1 ] ) ,",
    "in the following we only show the correlation calculated from the fragmentation diphoton part .",
    "the general features of the ( de)-correlations discussed below , persist for the prompt diphoton production , albeit the magnitude of the correlation is uniformly smaller .",

    "we have also studied the diphoton azimuthal angular correlations in p+p and p+a collisions at the lhc kinematics .",
    "it is generally seen that at low transverse momenta of the produced diphoton , back - to - back correlations of fragmentation , direct and prompt diphoton production are all sensitive to saturation physics , although this sensitivity is significantly stronger in two single - photon fragmentation parts .",
    "it was shown that the away - side peak in diphoton angular correlation is reduced by lowering the diphoton transverse momenta . at a fixed transverse momenta ,",
    "the suppression of the away - side correlations gets stronger as one goes to larger rapidities ( or higher energies ) or a denser system .",
    "the main features of away - side decorrelation of diphoton production seem to be universally similar to that in dihadron @xcite and photon - hadron @xcite productions in high - energy p+a collisions . in all cases , the away - side correlations of the produced di - particle get suppressed in the presence of a large saturation scale irrespective of mechanism by which the particles are produced and the saturation scale is enhanced .",
    "we recall that diphoton production is a theoretically cleaner probe of initial - state effects and small - x dynamics compared to dihadron production , mainly due to the fact that the diphoton production is free from hadronization corrections which theoretically are not too well understood .",
    "moreover , since the virtual photons do not interact with the gluons inside target , final - state effects are absent in the diphoton production .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to define the kinematics and derive the needed relations between various light - cone energy fractions which appear in the production cross sections used .",
    "this is slightly different from the standard relations used in production cross sections based on collinear factorization theorems of pqcd .",
    "we first consider scattering of a quark on the target where a photon and a quark are produced , depicted in fig .  1 , q(p)+a ( p_a)(k_1 ) + ( k_2 ) + ( q ) + x , where @xmath2 is a label for the multi - gluon state , described by a classical field representing a proton or nucleus target . in the standard pqcd ( leading twist )",
    "kinematics , only one parton from the target interacts .",
    "this is not the case here since the target is described by a classical gluon field representing a multi - gluon state with intrinsic momentum rather than an individual gluon with a well defined energy fraction @xmath29 and zero transverse momentum .",
    "nevertheless , since most of the gluons in the target wave function have momentum of order @xmath146 , one can think of the state describing the target as being labeled by a ( four ) momentum @xmath147 . in this sense ,",
    "the gluons in the target collectively carry fraction @xmath29 of the target energy and have intrinsic transverse momentum denoted by @xmath148 .",
    "this also means that there is no integration over @xmath29 in our case unlike the collinearly factorized cross sections in pqcd ( this basically corresponds to setting @xmath29 equal to the lower limit of @xmath29 integration in pqcd cross sections ) .",
    "we thus have @xmath149 where @xmath150 are the momenta of the incoming projectile , target and the produced jet respectively .",
    "( pseudo)-rapidities of the produced diphoton is related to their energies via @xmath151 imposing energy - momentum conservation at the partonic level via @xmath152 and using leads to @xmath153 plugging the definitions given in into the above relations and using ( and the on mass - shell condition ) , one can immediately obtain the energy fractions @xmath154 in the case of the diphoton+jet production : @xmath155 where the first and second equation was directly derived from and , respectively .",
    "note that light - cone momentum fraction @xmath29 appears in the dipole forward scattering amplitude @xmath156 whereas @xmath39 is the fraction of the projectile proton carried by the incident quark , see .",
    "one can relate the transverse momentum of the fragmented hadron @xmath157 to the out - going quark @xmath86 via @xmath158 . now using",
    ", the minimum value of @xmath47 is obtained for the maximum value of @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath160 for obtaining the diphoton production , one integrates over the out - going quark transverse momentum and rapidity of diphoton+jet cross - section .",
    "the integral over rapidity of out - going jet or @xmath67 can be done analytically .",
    "therefore , some extra care is in order here .",
    "let us first introduce the parameter @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the fraction of energy of parton carried away by two produced photons defined by , z_1 & & = e^__1 , + z_2 & & = e^__2 .",
