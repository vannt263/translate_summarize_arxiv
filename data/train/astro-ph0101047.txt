    "compact objects , neutron stars ( ns ) or black holes ( bh ) , formed from relatively massive stars can spiral in and coalesce when found in tight binaries , the orbital evolution of which is driven by gravitational radiation . as angular momentum losses dominate , the orbit shrinks and the two compact objects can eventually merge as they revolve in orbit around each other .",
    "the prototype progenitor system of such inspiral events is the binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 ( the `` hulse  taylor '' pulsar @xcite ) .",
    "sensitive pulsar timing measurements have revealed that the orbital period decreases at a rate comparable ( to better than 1% ) to that predicted by general relativity for the emission of gravitational waves @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ultimate coalescence of the two neutron stars seems inevitable .",
    "although psr b1913 + 16 will not reach coalescence for another 300myr , similar inspiraling systems in the milky way and nearby galaxies are thought to be primary sources of gravitational radiation for ground  based interferometric gravitational  wave detectors , currently under construction or commissioning ( e.g. , ligo , virgo , geo600 ) .",
    "in addition to ns ",
    "ns close binaries , ns  bh and bh  bh binaries are also expected to form through the evolution of massive binaries and to contribute to the detection of inspiral events .",
    "the expected detection rate of inspiral events depends on ( i ) the strength of the expected gravitational  wave signal , ( ii ) the gravitational  wave detector sensitivity , and ( iii ) the coalescence rate of each binary population .",
    "the first two considerations define a maximum distance @xmath0 , out to which different types of inspiral events and mergers could be detected .",
    "the coalescence rate for each population is estimated in two steps : first , the galactic rate , and then its extrapolation out to the maximum distance of interest . based on the current understanding of the ligo sensitivities , the maximum distances out to which inspiral events could be detected by ligo ii ( and ligo",
    "i ) are ( approximately ) , 350mpc ( 20mpc ) for ns ",
    "ns binaries , 700mpc ( 40mpc ) for ns  bh binaries , and 1500mpc ( 100mpc ) for bh  bh binaries ( assuming 1.4m@xmath1 ns and 10m@xmath1 bh ; sam finn , private communication ) . given our current best knowledge ( based on recent redshift surveys ) of galaxy distributions out to those distances @xcite , it can be estimated that , for a ligo ii detection rate of 1 event per year , the following _ galactic _ coalescence rates are required : @xmath2yr@xmath3 for ns ",
    "ns binaries , @xmath4yr@xmath3 for ns ",
    "bh binaries , and @xmath5yr@xmath3 for bh ",
    "bh binaries .",
    "formation rates of _ coalescing _ compact binaries ( systems with tight enough orbits that merge within a hubble time @xmath6yr ) have been calculated so far using two very different methods : either entirely theoretically , based on binary evolution models , or , for ns ",
    "ns binaries , empirically , based on the observed ns ",
    "ns sample . in what follows",
    "we present an up  to  date review of current rate estimates , addressing in detail the most important uncertainties associated with them .",
    "we also discuss independent ways of obtaining upper limits to the coalescence rate of ns ",
    "ns binaries and possible implications of the formation of systems without recycled pulsars .",
    "the formation rate of coalescing binary compact objects can be calculated , given a sequence of evolutionary stages leading to binary compact object formation . over the years",
    ", a relatively standard picture has been formed describing the birth of such systems based on considerations of ns ",
    "ns binaries @xcite .",
    "more recently , variations of the standard evolutionary channel have also been discussed and suggested @xcite , mainly based on worries about the fate of neutron stars in situations of hypercritical accretion ( not limited to the photon eddington rate ) , and their possible collapse into black holes . in all versions",
    ", however , the main picture remains the same : the initial binary progenitor consists of two binary members massive enough to eventually collapse into a ns or a bh .",
    "the evolutionary path involves multiple phases of stable or unstable mass transfer , common  envelope phases ( where one or possibly two stellar cores spiral in the envelopes of evolved stars and eventually lead to the ejection of these envelopes ) , and accretion onto compact objects , as well as two core collapse events .",
    "the final outcome of interest is the formation of binary compact objects in close binary orbits .    such theoretical",
    "modeling has been undertaken by a number of different groups by means of population syntheses .",
    "this provides us with _ ab initio _ predictions of coalescence rates .",
    "monte carlo numerical techniques are employed in following the evolution of a large ensemble of primordial binaries with certain assumed initial properties through a multitude of channels until compact object binaries are formed .",
    "the changes in the properties of the binaries at the end of each stage are calculated based on our current understanding of the various evolutionary processes involved : wind mass loss from massive hydrogen and helium  rich stars , mass and angular  momentum losses during mass transfer phases , dynamically unstable mass transfer and common  envelope evolution , effects of highly super  eddington accretion onto ns , and supernova explosions with kicks imparted to newborn ns or even bh . given our limited understanding of some of these phases ,",
    "the results of population synthesis are expected to depend on the assumptions made in the treatment of the various processes .",
    "therefore , exhaustive parameter studies are required by the nature of the problem .",
    "recent studies of the formation of compact objects and calculations of their galactic coalescence rates ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have explored the input parameter space and the robustness of the results at different levels of ( in)completeness .",
    "almost all of these groups have studied the sensitivity of the predicted coalescence rates to the average magnitude of the kicks imparted to compact objects at birth .",
    "the range of predicted ns  ns galactic rates obtained by varying the kick magnitude alone is found in the range @xmath7yr@xmath3 .",
    "this large range indicates the importance of supernovae ( two in this case ) in the evolution of massive binaries .",
    "variations in the assumed mass  ratio distribution for the primordial binaries can _ further _ change the predicted rate by about a factor of @xmath8 , while assumptions of the common  envelope phase add another factor of about @xmath9 .",
    "variation in other parameters typically affects the results by factors of two or less . predicted rates for bh  ns and bh  bh binaries lie in the ranges @xmath10yr@xmath3 and @xmath11yr@xmath3 , respectively when the kick magnitude to both ns and bh is varied .",
    "other uncertain factors such as the critical progenitor mass for ns and bh formation lead to variations of the rates by factors of @xmath12 .",
    "it is evident that recent theoretical predictions for coalescence rates cover a wide range of values ( typically 34 orders of magnitude ) , because the various input parameters and assumptions affect strongly the absolute normalization ( birth rate ) of the modeled populations .",
    "given these results , it seems fair to say that , at least at present , population synthesis calculations have a rather limited predictive power and provide fairly loose constraints on coalescence rates .",
    "one way to improve the reliability of such predictions is to study a number of different binary populations ( with or without compact objects ) and incorporate a number of independent observational constraints , such as star formation rate , supernova rates of different types , binarity of wolf  rayet stars , and others .",
    "a number of constraints on the population synthesis models could help restricting the predicted coalescence rates in narrower ranges @xcite .",
    "the large range of theoretically predicted galactic coalescence rates of double compact objects motivates us to examine other ways of obtaining rate estimates . the observed sample of coalescing ns ",
    "ns binaries found in the galactic field ( psr b1913 + 16 and psr b1534 + 12 ) provides us with alternative estimates of their coalescence rate .",
    "`` empirical '' estimates can be obtained using the observed pulsar and binary properties along with models of selection effects in radio pulsar surveys @xcite , @xcite . for each observed object",
    ", a scale factor can be calculated based on the fraction of the galactic volume within which pulsars with properties identical to those of the observed pulsar could be detected by any of the radio pulsar surveys , given their detection thresholds .",
    "this scale factor is a measure of how many more pulsars like the ones detected in the coalescing ns ",
    "ns systems exist in our galaxy . the coalescence rate can then be calculated based on the scale factors and estimates of detection lifetimes summed up for all the observed systems .",
    "based on this method the first two studies concluded that the ns ",
    "ns galactic coalescence rate is @xmath13yr@xmath3 .    since then , estimates of the ns ",
    "ns coalescence rate have known a significant downward revision primarily because of ( i ) the increase of the galactic volume covered by radio pulsar surveys with no additional coalescing ns ",
    "ns being discovered @xcite , ( ii ) the increase of the distance estimate for psr b1534 + 12 based on measurements of post - newtonian parameters @xcite ( iii ) revisions of the lifetime estimates @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recent estimates place the ns ",
    "ns rate for our galaxy in the range @xmath14yr@xmath3 .",
    "further , it has been realized that a number of upward correction factors must be included , most importantly to account ( i ) for the beamed nature of pulsar emission and correct for all the binary pulsars with beams that our line of sight does not intersect , and ( ii ) for the faint end of the pulsar luminosity function and correct for those systems that are too faint to be detected .",
    "these two correction ( multiplication ) factors have so far typically been assumed to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .    in a study",
    "just recently completed @xcite , we especially focused on all the uncertainties associated with these empirical estimates .",
    "we found that the upward correction factor for the faint end of the pulsar luminosity is the most important source of uncertainty .",
    "however , it is highly sensitive to the number of observed objects and its distribution function widens dramatically for small  number samples . for",
    "a sample of two objects ( as the observed one ) the faint  pulsar correction factor can vary from very small ( close to unity ) to as high as @xmath17 ( see following subsection ) . beyond the issue of faint pulsars",
    ", we considered a number of uncertainties and correction factors .",
    "based on recent observational data for both psr b1913 + 16 and psr b1534 + 12 , we found that the beaming correction factor is higher than previously thought ( @xmath18 ) but with a rather small uncertainty ( @xmath16% ) .",
    "other factors , such as pulsar ages and lifetimes , and spatial distribution , lead to an uncertainty factor of about 2 .",
    "we estimate the galactic ns ",
    "ns coalescence rate in the range @xmath19yr@xmath3 , which is still narrow compared to the range covered by the theoretical estimates",
    ".      one important limitation of empirical estimates of the coalescence rates is that they are derived based on _ only two _ observed ns ",
    "ns systems , under the assumption that the observed sample is representative of the true population , particularly in terms of their radio luminosity . assuming that the recycled pulsars in ns ",
    "ns binaries follow the radio luminosity function of young pulsars and that therefore their true galactic population is dominated in number by low ",
    "luminosity pulsars , it can be shown that the current empirical estimates most probably _",
    "under_estimate the true coalescence rate . if a small  number sample is drawn from a parent population dominated by low ",
    "luminosity ( hence hard to detect ) objects , it is statistically more probable that the sample will actually be dominated by objects from the high  luminosity end of the population .",
    "the result is that the population overall is thought to be brighter than it really is , and therefore , detectable over a larger galactic volume .",
    "consequently , the empirical estimates based on such a sample will tend to overestimate the detection volume for each observed system , and therefore underestimate the scale factors and the resulting coalescence rate .",
    "this effect can be clearly demonstrated with a monte carlo experiment @xcite using simple models for the pulsar luminosity function and the survey selection effects . as a first step ,",
    "the average observed number of pulsars is calculated given a known `` true '' total number of pulsars in the galaxy ( thick - solid line in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as a second step , a large number of sets consisting of `` observed '' ( simulated ) pulsars are realized using monte carlo methods .",
    "these pulsars are drawn from a poisson distribution of a given mean number ( @xmath20 ) and have luminosities assigned according to the assumed luminosity function .",
    "based on each of these sets , one can estimate the total number of pulsars in the galaxy using empirical scale factors , as is done for the real observed sample .",
    "the many ( simulated ) `` observed '' samples can then be used to obtain the distribution of the estimated total galactic numbers ( @xmath21 ) of pulsars .",
    "we find that these @xmath21 distributions are very strongly skewed and lead to possible correction factors for the faint pulsars in a wide range of values ( covering typically a couple of orders of magnitude ) .",
    "the median and 25% and 75% percentiles of this distribution are plotted as a function of the assumed number of systems in the ( fake ) `` observed '' samples in figure [ fig1 ] ( thin  solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "it is evident that , in the case of small  number observed samples ( less than @xmath22 objects ) , the estimated total number , and hence the estimated coalescence rate , can be underestimated by a significant factor . for observed samples with an expected number of objects equal to two , for example , the true rate may be much higher by more than a factor as high as @xmath17 .",
    "this underestimation factor represents an upward correction factor that must be applied to the rate estimated using the observed sample of _ coalescing _ ns  ns binaries .",
    "however , we note that distribution of this correction factor covers a wide range and becomes highly skewed for small number samples ( less than about 10 objects ) , and therefore it is currently quite uncertain .",
    "we conclude that correcting for the undetected , faint pulsars in the population can not be decoupled from the problems of a small  number sample because of the assumption of the observed sample being representative of the population , implicit in the method .",
    "observations of ns  ns systems and isolated pulsars related to ns ",
    "ns formation allow us to obtain upper limits on their galactic coalescence rate in a number of different ways .",
    "depending on how their value compares to the galactic rate required for a ligo ii detection rate of 1 event per year , such limits can in principle provide us with valuable information about the prospects of gravitational  wave detection .    the absence of any young pulsars detected in ns ",
    "ns systems was used to obtain a rough upper limit to the rate of @xmath23yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recently the same basic argument was reexamined in more detail and a more robust upper limit of @xmath24yr@xmath3 was derived @xcite .",
    "an upper bound to the ns ",
    "ns coalescence rate can also be obtained by combining our theoretical understanding of orbital dynamics ( for supernovae with ns kicks in binaries ) with empirical estimates of the birth rates of _ other _ types of pulsars related to ns ",
    "ns formation @xcite .",
    "progenitors of ns ",
    "ns systems experience two supernova explosions .",
    "the second supernova explosion ( forming the ns that is _ not _ observed as a pulsar ) provides a unique tool for the study of ns ",
    "ns formation , since the post  supernova evolution of the system is simple , driven only by gravitational  wave radiation .",
    "there are three possible outcomes after the second supernova : ( i ) a coalescing ns ",
    "ns is formed ( cb ) , ( ii ) a wide ns  ns ( with a coalescence time longer than the hubble time ) is formed ( wb ) , or ( iii ) the binary is disrupted ( d ) and a single pulsar similar to the ones seen in ns ",
    "ns systems is ejected .",
    "based on supernova orbital dynamics we can accurately calculate the probability branching ratios for these three outcomes , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . for a given kick magnitude , we can calculate the maximum ratio @xmath28 for the complete range of pre - supernova parameters defined by the necessary constraint @xmath29 ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "given that the two types of systems have a common parent progenitor population , the ratio of probabilities is equal to the ratio of the birth rates @xmath30 .",
    "we can then use ( i ) the absolute maximum of the probability ratio ( @xmath31 from figure [ fig2 ] ) and ( ii ) an empirical estimate of the birth rate of single pulsars similar to those in ns  ns based on the current observed sample to obtain an upper limit to the coalescence rate .",
    "the selection of this sample involves some subtleties @xcite , and the analysis results in @xmath32yr@xmath3 .",
    "note that this number could be increased because of the small  number sample and luminosity bias , which this time affects the empirical estimate of @xmath33 by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "such an upward correction can bring the upper limit in the range @xmath35yr@xmath3 .",
    "this is an example of how we can use observed systems other than ns ",
    "ns to improve our understanding of their coalescence rate .",
    "a similar calculation can be done using the wide ns ",
    "ns systems instead of the single pulsars @xcite .",
    "we have already pointed out that the empirical methods employed to obtain rate estimates for ns  ns coalescence include the implicit assumption that the properties of the observed sample are representative of the galactic ns ",
    "ns population .",
    "this assumption extends to the pulsar properties and their evolutionary history of recycling ( spin  up by accretion ) .",
    "consistent with the pulsars observed in the detected ns ",
    "ns systems , it turns out that so far theoretical studies of ns  ns formation have considered systems where one of the neutron stars had the opportunity to be recycled , at least in principle ( through stellar winds , roche  lobe overflow accretion , or even possibly in a common  envelope phase ) .    here , we report on a new evolutionary path leading to the formation of close ns ",
    "ns binaries , with the unique characteristic that none of the two ns ever had the chance to be recycled by accretion . as we will discuss in more detail , such ns ",
