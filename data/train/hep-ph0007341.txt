    "one of the most active areas of research in nuclear and particle physics during the last several decades is the study of quark and gluon distributions in the nucleons and nuclei .",
    "several major surprises were discovered in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments which profoundly changed our views of the partonic substructure of hadrons . in the early 1980 s ,",
    "the famous ` emc ' effect found in muon dis provided the first unambiguous evidence that the quark distributions in nuclei are significantly different from those in free nucleons  @xcite .",
    "more recently , surprising results on the spin and flavor structures of the nucleons were discovered in dis experiments .",
    "the so - called ` spin crisis ' , revealed by the disagreement between the prediction of the ellis - jaffe sum rule and the polarized dis experiments , has led to extensive theoretical and experimental efforts to understand the partonic content of proton s spin  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the observation  @xcite of the violation of the gottfried sum rule  @xcite in dis revealed a surprisingly large asymmetry between the up and down antiquark distributions in the nucleon , shedding new light on the origins of the nucleon sea .",
    "+ the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei can also be measured with hadronic probes .",
    "a powerful tool for such studies is the drell - yan process  @xcite , in which a quark annihilates with an antiquark forming a virtual photon which subsequently decays into a lepton pair .",
    "the proton - induced drell - yan process is of particular interest , since it can be used to extract antiquark distributions of the target nucleon and nuclei .",
    "this provides information complementary to what can be obtained in dis , which is sensitive to the sum of the quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "+ the usefulness of the drell - yan process as a tool for probing antiquark distributions has been well demonstrated by a series of fermilab dimuon production experiments  @xcite . in particular , the drell - yan cross section ratios for @xmath0 versus @xmath1 led to a direct measurement of the @xmath3 asymmetry as a function of bjorken-@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nuclear dependence of the drell - yan cross sections showed no evidence for antiquark enhancement in heavy nuclei  @xcite , in striking disagreements with predictions of some theoretical models which were capable of explaining the emc effect .",
    "+ the 50-gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) offers a unique opportunity to extend existing measurements of antiquark distributions to much larger values of bjorken-@xmath2 .",
    "such information is crucial for understanding the origins of flavor asymmetry in the nucleon sea , and for illuminating the nuclear environment effects on parton distributions .",
    "moreover , drell - yan measurements using polarized proton beam on polarized target at the 50-gev ps will provide a first determination of the spin - dependent antiquark distribution at an @xmath2 region not accessible in the rhic - spin program .",
    "indeed , the flavor asymmetry of polarized sea quark distributions , predicted to be very large by certain theoretical models  @xcite , can be directly measured .",
    "+ a detailed study of the nuclear dependence of drell - yan cross sections at 50 gev could also lead to a first observation of the coherent partonic energy - loss effects predicted recently by baier , dokshitser , mueller , peigne , schiff ( bdmps )  @xcite and by zakharov  @xcite .",
    "these authors studied the radiative energy loss ( through gluon emission ) of high energy partons passing through hot and cold hadronic matter .",
    "the partonic energy - loss effect is the qcd analog of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) qed effect  @xcite predicted over 40 years ago and confirmed only recently at slac  @xcite .",
    "a number of surprising effects were obtained by bdmps and zakharov .",
    "first , the partonic energy loss in a hot qcd plasma is predicted to be much larger than in cold matter .",
    "this suggests that an anomalously large energy loss of jets produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions could be a signature for quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "second , the radiative energy loss is predicted to be proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the path length of hot or cold nuclear matter traversed by the partons .",
    "this curious result is contrary to the conventional wisdom that energy loss depends linearly on @xmath5 , and it reflects the quantum - mechanical interference effect from several contributing diagrams .",
    "+ an attempt to search for partonic energy - loss effects in cold matter was made recently via the study of nuclear dependence of drell - yan cross sections at 800 gev  @xcite . only an upper limit for partonic energy loss",
    "was determined .",
    "a much more sensitive study can be made at lower beam energies , where the fractional energy loss @xmath6 will be larger . at the 50-gev ps",
    ", the effect is expected to be much enhanced and indeed one could even examine whether the nuclear effect follows the @xmath5 or @xmath4 dependence . + while logarithmic scaling violation is well established in dis experiments , no clear evidence for scaling violation has been seen in drell - yan process .",
    "the 50-gev ps provides an interesting opportunity for unambiguously establishing scaling violation in the drell - yan process  @xcite . for given values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( bjorken-@xmath2 for the projectile and target partons , respectively ) , scaling - violation",
    "is expected to cause roughly a factor of two increase in the drell - yan cross sections when proton beam energy is decreased from 800 gev to 50 gev .",
    "it appears quite feasible to establish scaling violation in the drell - yan process with future data from the 50-gev ps .",
    "+ detection of high - mass dileptons at the 50-gev ps will also allow a study of @xmath9 and @xmath10 production .",
    "existing data on proton - induced charmonium production are mostly limited to the energy range 150 gev @xmath11 800 gev .",
    "a comparison of 50 gev charmonium production data with existing data will further improve our knowledge on the production and propagation of charmonium in the nuclear medium .",
    "many different effects which could affect the production of charmonium in nuclear medium , such as nuclear shadowing , partonic energy loss , final - state interaction with comoving gluons or hadrons , will have different beam energy dependences  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a systematic study of charmonium production in @xmath12 and @xmath13 collisions at 50 gev would be extremely valuable for disentangling various effects .",
    "only after the mechanisms for charmonium production are well understood could @xmath9-suppression be used confidently as a signature for quark - gluon plasma formation in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . + many of the proposed studies for drell - yan process at the 50-gev ps",
    "could also benefit from the @xmath9 and @xmath10 data . unlike the drell - yan which is an electromagnetic process",
    ", quarkonium production is a strong - interaction process involving gluon - gluon fusion and quark - antiqaurk fusion .",
    "comparison between the drell - yan and quarkonium production data will further elucidate various aspects of parton distributions in nucleons and nuclei , and of the propagation of partons in nuclei . as an example",
    ", charmonium production with polarized proton beam at the 50-gev ps might provide interesting information on the gluon distributions at large bjorken-@xmath2 , which is essentially unknown .",
    "+ in this paper , we discuss the physics interest and the feasibility for making precise measurements of high - mass dimuons at the 50-gev ps . in section 2 the physics motivation for various measurements will be discussed in some details .",
    "a preliminary design study of a dimuon spectrometer for the 50-gev ps will be presented in section 3 .",
    "a summary is given in section 4 .",
    "detection of high - mass dileptons produced in high - energy hadronic interactions has a long and glorious history .",
    "the charm and beauty quarks were discovered in the 1970 s via the dilepton decay modes of @xmath9 and @xmath14 resonances .",
    "these quarkonium states are superimposed on a dilepton continuum known as the drell - yan process  @xcite .",
    "the drell - yan data has been a source of information for the antiquark structure of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , drell - yan production with pion and kaon beams has yielded the parton distributions of these unstable particles for the first time .",
    "a generalized drell - yan process was also responsible for the discovery of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 gauge bosons in the 1980 s .",
    "+ to lowest order , the drell - yan process depends on the product of quark and antiquark distributions in the beam and target as @xmath17 .",

    "the sum is over quark flavors , and @xmath19 is the center - of - mass energy squared .",
    "+ the kinematics of the virtual photon @xmath20 longitudinal center - of - mass momentum @xmath21 , transverse momentum @xmath22 and mass @xmath23 @xmath20 are determined by measuring the two - muon decay of the virtual photon .",
    "these quantities determine the momentum fractions of the two quarks : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath21 is the virtual photon center - of - mass longitudinal momentum and @xmath26 is the maximum value it can have .",
    "+ although the simple parton model enjoyed considerable success in explaining many features of the early data , it was soon realized that qcd corrections to the parton model were required .",
    "the inclusion of the nlo diagrams for the drell - yan process brings excellent agreement between the calculations and the data . as an example , figure  [ figsum ] shows the na3 data  @xcite at 400 gev , together with the e605  @xcite and e772  @xcite data at 800 gev .",
    "the solid curves in figure  [ figsum ] correspond to nlo calculation for 800 gev @xmath0 ( @xmath27 = 38.9 gev ) and they describe the na3/e605/e772 data well .",
    "this shows that the mechanism for drell - yan process is well understood theoretically , and quantitative information on the parton distributions can be reliably extracted via this process .",
    "+ to gain sensitivity to the antiquark distribution of the target , one chooses a proton beam and selects the kinematic region of positive @xmath28 and large @xmath7 . in this limit",
    "the contribution from the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : dy ] is small and the first term is dominated by the @xmath29 distribution of the proton . under these circumstances ,",
    "the ratio of the cross sections for two different targets , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which have @xmath32 and @xmath33 nucleons is approximately the ratio of the @xmath34 distributions : @xmath35 in this relation the cross sections are defined per nucleus but the parton distributions are conventionally defined per nucleon .",
    "[ eq : csfrac ] demonstrates the power of drell - yan experiments in determining relative antiquark distributions .",
    "this feature was explored by recent fermilab experiments using 800 gev proton beams  @xcite .",
    "the 50-gev ps provides a unique opportunity for extending the fermilab measurements to larger @xmath8 ( @xmath36 ) . for a given value of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the drell - yan cross section is proportional to @xmath37 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dy ] ) .",
    "hence the cross section at 50 gev is roughly 16 times greater than that at 800 gev ( the price one pays at lower beam energies is that one has limited reach for small @xmath8 , which could best be studied at higher energies ) .",
    "furthermore , to the extent that the radiation dose scales as beam power , one can take @xmath38 16 times higher beam flux at 50 gev relative to 800 gev .",
    "the combination of these two effects could lead to two orders of magnitude improvement in the statistics at high @xmath8 over previous fermilab experiments .",
    "+      the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : dy ] is only a function of @xmath39 and is independent of the beam energy .",
    "this scaling property no longer holds when qcd corrections to the drell - yan process are taken into account . while scaling violation is well established in dis experiments , it is not confirmed in drell - yan experiments at all .",
    "no convincing evidence for scaling violation is seen  @xcite . as discussed in a recent review  @xcite",
    ", there are mainly two reasons for this .",
    "first , unlike the dis , the drell - yan cross section is a convolution of two structure functions . for proton - induced drell - yan ,",
    "one often involves a beam quark with @xmath40 and a target antiquark with @xmath41 .",
    "scaling violation implies that the structure functions rise for @xmath42 and drop for @xmath43 as @xmath44 increases .",
    "hence the effects of scaling violation are partially cancelled .",
    "second , unlike the dis , the drell - yan experiment can only probe relatively large @xmath44 , namely , @xmath45 gev@xmath46 for a mass cut of 4 gev .",
    "this makes it more difficult to observe the logarithmic @xmath44 variation of the structure functions in drell - yan experiments .",
    "+ the 50-gev ps provides an interesting opportunity for unambiguously establishing scaling violation in the drell - yan process .",
    "figure  [ dyscale ] shows the predictions for @xmath0 at 50 gev .",
    "scaling violation causes a factor of two increase in the drell - yan cross sections when the beam energy is decreased from 800 gev to 50 gev .",
    "it appears quite feasible to establish scaling violation in drell - yan with future dilepton production experiments at the 50-gev ps .",
    "+      from neutrino - induced dis experiments , it is known that the strange quark sea in the nucleon is roughly a factor of two less than the up or down quark sea  @xcite .",
    "the lack of su(3 ) flavor symmetry in the nucleon sea is attributed to the much heavier mass of the strange quark . until recently",
    ", it had been assumed that the distributions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks were identical . although the equality of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the proton is not required by any known symmetry ,",
    "this is a plausible assumption for sea quarks generated by gluon splitting .",
    "because the masses of the up and down quarks are small compared to the confinement scale , nearly equal numbers of up and down sea quarks should result .",
    "+ the assumption of @xmath49 can be tested by measurements of the gottfried integral  @xcite , defined as @xmath50/x~ dx = { 1\\over 3}+{2\\over 3}\\int_0 ^ 1 \\left[\\bar u_p(x)-\\bar d_p(x)\\right]dx , \\label{eq:3.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the proton and neutron structure functions measured in dis experiments . under the assumption of a symmetric sea , @xmath47 = @xmath48 , the gottfried sum rule ( gsr )  @xcite , @xmath53 ,",

    "therefore , one expects the drell - yan cross sections for heavier nuclear targets to drop more rapidly at large @xmath7 ( or @xmath28 ) .",
    "+ data from e772 at 800 gev / c were analysed by gavin and milana  @xcite to deduce the initial - state quark energy loss .",
    "they ignored the shadowing effect and assumed the following expression for the average change in the momentum fraction : @xmath119 a surprisingly large fractional energy loss ( @xmath120 ) was obtained .",
    "this result was questioned by brodsky and hoyer  @xcite , who argued that the time scale for gluon bremsstrahlung need to be taken into account . moreover , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is important to account for the shadowing effect before a reliable value of partonic energy loss can be extracted . using an analogy to the photon bremsstrahlung process , brodsky and hoyer suggested an alternative expression : @xmath121 where @xmath19 is the square of the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ eq : gavin ] implies a linear dependence of the energy loss on the partonic energy , while eq .",
    "[ eq : brodsky ] assumes a constant energy loss independent of the partonic energy ( note that @xmath122 is proportional to @xmath123 ) .",
    "based on uncertainty principle , brodsky and hoyer concluded that energetic partons should loose @xmath124 gev / fm in nuclei .",
    "more recently , baier et al .",
    "@xcite and zakharov  @xcite predicted @xmath125 these authors obtained the nonintuitive result that the total energy loss is proportional to the square of the path length traversed .",
    "+ very recently , the e866 nuclear - dependence data have been analysed by taking into consideration the shadowing effect and comparing with the three different expressions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : gavin ]  -  [ eq : baier ] ) for energy loss  @xcite .",
    "upper limits of @xmath126 gev@xmath46 and @xmath127 gev@xmath46 have been obtained .",
    "the @xmath128 limit corresponds to a constant energy loss rate of @xmath129 gev / fm , while the @xmath130 limit implies @xmath131 gev/@xmath132 , where @xmath5 is the quark propagation length through the nucleus .",
    "this is very close to the lower value given by baier et al .",
    "@xcite for cold nuclear matter . + a much more sensitive study of the partonic energy loss could be carried out at the 50-gev ps .",
    "we have simulated the effect of initial - state energy loss on the @xmath133 drell - yan cross sections , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : elossb ] . assuming a 60-day run with the nominal spectrometer configuration ( see section 3 ) , the expected @xmath7 distribution for @xmath0 is shown as the solid curve .",
    "the dashed , dotted , and dash - dotted curves in figure  [ fig : elossb ] correspond to @xmath133 @xmath7 spectra assuming a partonic energy loss form of eq .",
    "[ eq : brodsky ] with @xmath134 of -0.1 , -0.25 , -0.5 gev / fm , respectively .",
    "the ratios of @xmath133 over @xmath0 , shown in figure  [ fig : elossb ] , are very sensitive to the quark energy loss rate , and the expected statistical accuracy can easily identify an energy loss as small as 0.1 gev / fm .",
    "the greater sensitivity at 50 gev is due to the @xmath37 factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : brodsky ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : baier ] .",
    "another important advantage at 50 gev is the absence of shadowing effect , and no shadowing correction is required .",
    "+ the drell - yan a - dependence data could further be used to determine whether the energy loss follows an @xmath5 ( as in eq .",
    "[ eq : brodsky ] ) or an @xmath4 ( as in eq .",
    "[ eq : baier ] ) dependence .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : elossa ] , where the solid circles correspond to @xmath135 assuming an energy - loss rate of 0.25 gev / fm using eq .",
    "[ eq : brodsky ] .",
    "the open squares correspond to the situation when energy loss is described by eq .",
    "[ eq : baier ] ( the value of @xmath130 is selected by matching the @xmath136 values for both cases ) . figure  [ fig : elossa ] shows that one can easily distinguish an @xmath5- from an @xmath4-dependence even when the energy loss rate is as small as 0.25 gev / fm .",
    "unlike the drell - yan process , the mechanisms for @xmath9 production are not well understood .",
    "several quarkonium production models have been considered in the literature , including color - evaporation , color - singlet , and color - octet models . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the color - evaporation model , which is capable of describing the energy - dependence and the shape of the differential cross sections well .",
    "however , the absolute normalization of this model is treated as a parameter .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : jpsi301 ] shows the prediction of the color - evaporation model for @xmath9 production at 50 gev .",
    "the absolute normalization is obtained from an extrapolation of the global fit of existing @xmath9 data  @xcite .",
    "unlike the situation at 800 gev where the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess dominates  @xcite , figure  [ fig : jpsi301 ] shows that the quark - antiquark annihilation is the dominant subprocess at 50 gev . while this is reminescent of the drell - yan process , it is worth noting that quarkonium production is a hadronic process unlike the electromagnetic drell - yan process .",
    "hence , there is no @xmath137 weighting factor for the @xmath138 subprocess in @xmath9 production . +",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : jpsi301 ] , the @xmath9 production data at 50 gev are largely sensitive to quark distributions and could provide information similar to drell - yan .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : jpsi310 ] which shows that the @xmath9 cross section ratio for @xmath139 over @xmath140 is very sensitive to the @xmath60 asymmetry just like the drell - yan process .",
    "this could be readily tested at the 50-gev ps , since the @xmath9 event rate is expected to be very high . + it is also of interest to measure @xmath9 production using polarized proton beam and target . unfortunately",
    ", the uncertainty of the production mechanism might make it difficult to deduce information on polarized structure functions .",
    "the spectrometer considered here is designed to measure muon pairs at @xmath141 1 gev with 50 gev proton beam . the e866 spectrometer and its daughter , a proposed p906 spectrometer @xcite ,",
    "are taken as a starting point .",
    "the e866 spectrometer is shown in figure  [ fig : e866setup ] .",
    "@xmath142 pairs produced at the target were analyzed by a vertical - bending spectrometer .",
    "the remaining proton beam was intercepted by a copper beam dump located inside the dipole magnet .",
    "the beam dump was followed by a set of absorbers made of copper , carbon , and polyethylene , which absorbed many of the pions and kaons produced at the target before they could decay into muon backgrounds .",
    "trigger hodoscopes , muon identifiers , and tracking counters followed the magnets .",
    "the magnetic current can be adjusted to optimize the acceptance of a selected mass range .",
    "the spectrometer has good acceptance for dimuons with @xmath143 and @xmath144 up to 3 gev / c .",
    "+ to design a spectrometer suitable for 50 gev proton beam , it is useful to consider some kinematics of the drell - yan process .",

    "more specifically , @xmath155 @xmath156    the measurable @xmath157 range of muons should be almost the same as the e866 spectrometer or slightly smaller because the mass ( @xmath158 ) range interested is the same or slightly less .",
    "thus the total magnetic rigidity ( @xmath159 ) of the magnets should be about 7 to 10 t@xmath160 m , though it depends on the geometrical layout of the detectors .",
    "the p906 spectrometer has a magnetic rigidity of 8 t@xmath160 m . + according to eq .",
    "[ eq : theta ] , the opening angle of the muons at 50 gev is about 4 times larger than at 800 gev ( e866 ) , and 1.5 times larger than at 120 gev ( p906 ) .",
    "one idea to design the 50-gev spectrometer is just to shorten the existing setup in the beam ( z ) direction with the factor of @xmath161(50 gev)/@xmath161(800 gev ) or @xmath161(50 gev)/@xmath161(120 gev ) .",
    "however , since the maximum field strength of the p906 magnet is already near the saturation point , a magnet of almost the same length and wider aperture need to be considered . + figure  [ fig:50gevspec ] shows the horizontal and vertical view of the proposed spectrometer .",
    "the target is assumed to be a liquid hydrogen or deuterium target 20-inch long and 3-inch wide .",
    "the produced charged particles are analyzed by a vertical - bending magnet , which is basically the same as the p906 magnet but has a wider aperture .",
    "the length of the magnet along the beam axis is 480.06 cm .",
    "the horizontal gap of the magnet at the exit is 116.84 cm and the vertical gap at the exit is 279.4 cm .",
    "the total momentum kick by this magnet is about 2.5 gev / c .",
    "the incident proton beam is stopped by a copper beam dump , followed by a set of absorber materials .",
    "the second magnet and detectors are placed after the first magnet .",
    "the momentum kick by the second magnet is 0.5 gev / c .",
    "the total length of the spectrometer system from the entrance of the first magnet to the end of the detector system is 1474.47 cm .",
    "the muons which hit all the detectors are accepted as signals . + a fast monte - carlo code , which takes into account the drell - yan cross section and the spectrometer configuration , has been used to estimate a statistical error for @xmath162 shown in figure [ fig : rate1 ] . in order to estimate the yields and statistical errors , the following assumptions have been applied :    * the beam intensity is @xmath163 protons/(3 sec . ) . *",
