    "x - ray variability has long been known to be a common property of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the x - ray variability in the continuum and in the emission lines can give a clue to the central engine in agns ( mushotzky et al .",
    "the variance amplitude and the time - scale are two main parameters which characterize the variance .",
    "there are many quantities can be used to describe the variability amplitude or the timescale in x - ray variability , such as the flux - doubling time - scale ( barr & mushotzky 1986 ) , normalized variability amplitude ( green et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the excess variance ( nandra et al . 1997 ) .",
    "some powerful methods are also introduced in the analysis of the x - ray light curves .",
    "these include the power density spectrum ( pds ) , the wavelet method ( otazu et al . 2002 ) , and the power density in the time domain ( li 2001 )",
    ".    there has been steady progress on the analysis of x - ray variability since the launch of exosat , rxte , rosat , asca , xmm - newton . for an individual x - ray light curve , pds analysis is now popular and can offer more information about the x - ray variability .",
    "early attempts to constrain a pds flattening or `` cut off '' , which relates to a characteristic time - scale , were made with the exosat data of ngc 5506 ( mchardy 1988 ) and ngc 4151 ( papadakis 1995 ) .",
    "these analyses yield evidence for a cutoff time - scale of several weeks . however , the uneven sampling of these data made their reliability uncertain .",
    "the situation was significantly improved with the launch of rxte .",
    "using rxte data , edelson & nandra ( 1999 ) obtained an evenly sampled x - ray light curve of ngc 3516 and produced a pds covering four decades in temporal frequency , finding a cutoff time - scale of about one month .",
    "pounds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found a cutoff time - scale of about 13 days for a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( akn 564 ) .",
    "uttley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) recently developed a monte carlo method to test models for the true power spectrum of intermittently sampled light curves against the observed noisy power spectra of four seyfert galaxies , which are flat towards lower frequencies .",
    "they fit two models for the flattening : a `` knee '' model and a `` high - frequency break '' model .",
    "they reduced the characteristic frequency for these four agns .",
    "the x - ray characteristic time - scale or frequency usually relates to the size of the x - ray emission region , which then can be used to constrain the central engine , e.g. the central black hole masses , accretion rates , and the radiation mechanism .",
    "rosat observations of agns offer plenty of information about the soft x - ray variability , which is thought to come from the accretion disk around the central black hole in these agns .",
    "however , pds analysis is not suitable for analyzing rosat pointed data , since there are usually large time gaps between adjacent exposures in rosat pointing observations .",
    "thus , time - scale analysis remains necessary in agn samples .",
    "there are obvious exponentially increasing or decreasing patterns in the soft x - ray light curves in some agns observed with rosat / pspc in pointing mode . in this paper",
    "we use the exponential time - scale ( zhao & fink 1996 ) to investigate the soft x - ray variability in agns with this kind of pattern .",
    "this paper is a continuation of the previous work of zhao & fink ( 1996 ) .",
    "the standard model of agns is an accretion disk with a jet around a central massive black hole .",
    "progress on a reliable estimate about black hole masses can effectively constrain the central engine when combined with the research on the x - ray variability .",
    "several methods have been used to estimate the mass of a black hole in the center of a galaxy .",
    "these include stellar dynamical studies ( reviewed by kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) , reverberation mapping methods ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , analyses of the high frequency tail of the power density spectrum ( czerny et al . 2001 ) , the relation between central black hole masses and the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath0 ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) , and the use of single - epoch rest - frame optical spectrophotometric measurements ( vestergaard 2002 ) .    in next section time - scales and central black hole masses of our sample are presented .",
    "we then give the physical constraints on the central engine of 38 agns in section 3 .",
    "in section 4 we derive the radii of the gravitational instability in the standard @xmath1 accretion disks of 12 agns and compare them with blrs sizes from the reverberation mapping method .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath2and @xmath3 have been adopted in this work .",
    "all sources were observed in rosat / pspc mode over periods varying from days to years .",
    "we picked out the agns from cross identification of the veron - cetty ( 2001 ) agn catalogue with the rosat point source catalog . from the rosat public archive of pspc observations , only sources with total x - ray photon counts greater than 1000",
    "were selected to ensure the quality of the x - ray spectra .",
    "this yielded more than 200 agns .",
    "the data were processed for instrument corrections ( such as vignetting and dead time effects ) and background subtraction using the exsas / midas software .",
    "the light curve for each agn was obtained from original rosat observations with a 400 seconds time bin in three energy bands ; 0.1 - 2.4 ( total band ) , 0.1 - 0.4 ( a band ) , 0.5 - 2.0 ( b band ) kev .",
    "the estimates of time - scales for all agns described below are based on those light curves . from these light curves",
    "we can find that there exist obvious exponentially increasing or decreasing patterns . since x - ray emission is believed to come from the accretion disk around the central black hole in agns",
    ", these exponential patterns may provide physical insight .",
    "we select the agn light curves with exponential patterns by the following criteria : ( 1)the count rate increased or decayed continually in the light curves , considering count rate uncertainties of 3 @xmath4 , ( 2)the number of the contiguous data points fitted by the exponential function ( eq . [ te ] ) are greater than 4 , ( 3)the magnitude of the count rate variance is greater than @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the count rate errors of the jumping - off point and end - point , respectively .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev of each agn is obtained by averaging the power - law fitting spectra of all the observations .",
    "we use the exponential time - scale ( zhao & fink 1996 ) to characterize the exponential pattern in the light curves in agns .",
    "the exponential time - scale , @xmath8 , is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the count rate at t , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants .",
    "the definition of exponential time - scale is based on instabilities which increase or decrease exponentially .",
    "thus the exponential time - scale is equivalent to a rising or a descending time - scale and @xmath12 is the amplitude of variability .",
    "@xmath11 is an additional constant component , which is equal to the intensity before or after the instability .",
    "it is exponentially increasing if the sign of @xmath12 is positive while it is exponentially decaying if the sign is negative . for agns with some values of @xmath13",
    ", we select @xmath8 with the smallest error as the time - scale . taking the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 as an example ( fig .",
    "[ cr - te ] ) , there are three obvious exponentially increasing or decreasing patterns in the light curve .",
    "three patterns fitting by eq .",
    "[ te ] showed similar exponential time - scales .",
    "the exponential time - scales are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 seconds , respectively , which are consistent if taking the errors into account . and @xmath11 are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 photons @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we think there is more physical information in the exponential time - scale than in the two - folding time - scale , which only considers the amplitude increased by a factor of two .",
    "there are usually large time gaps between adjacent exposures in rosat pointed observations .",
    "the two - folding time - scale will overestimate the time - scale of rosat sources . using our selection criteria as defined above , we searched for any obvious continually exponentially increasing or decreasing pattern in the light curve of each agn and then fitted the pattern with the form of eq .",
    "[ te ] , considering the errors of the count rates ( press et al . 1992 ) . the exponential time - scales fir 65 agns are listed in column 3 of table 1 , in which there are nine qsos , 37 seyfert 1 galaxies , nine nls1s , one seyfert 2 galaxies , four bl lacs and five high optical polarization ( hp ) objects .",
    "the time - scales calculated as rising exponentials are marked with a star .",
    "the rest are derived from decaying exponentials .",
    "the masses of 13 agns labelled with `` a '' in table 1 are adopted from nelson ( 2000 ) .",
    "they were estimated from the reverberation mapping methods with a high level of reliability .",
    "there is strong correlation between the black hole mass and the host velocity dispersion , namely the @xmath0 relation ( ferrarese et al .",
    "we adopt the @xmath0 relation found by merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) , namely ,    @xmath21    we derive masses for seven agns with measured host velocity dispersions , which are labelled with `` b '' in table 1 ( nelson & whittle 1995 ; falomo et al .",
    "the errors for black hole masses in these seven agns are estimated from the error of the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "an empirical relationship between single - epoch rest - frame optical spectrophotometric measurements and the central masses was recently presented ( vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "these methods for estimating agn masses are all calibrated using masses from the reverberation mapping method .",
    "the total number of agns with available black hole masses is 37 , of which there are 22 seyfert 1 galaxies , five nls1s , one seyfert 2 galaxies , eight quasars and one bl lac objects .",
    "the central black hole masses of these 37 agns are listed in column 5 in table 1 .",
    "the upper limit on the mass of the central black hole in agns derived from the time - scale is defined as ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 ) : @xmath22 assuming that the size of the x - ray radiation region is 5 schwarzschild radii .",
    "we compared this mass limit derived from the exponential time - scales with the above estimated central black hole masses ( see sec .",
    "[ mass ] ) in figure [ m - mt ] .",
    "this shows that the exponential time - scale can also provide an effective limit for the mass of a central black hole in an agn .",
    "some physical constraints on the relationship of bolometric luminosity and the time - scale were proposed by fabian ( 1979 ; 1992 ) .",
    "if the source luminosity is below the eddington limit , we obtained a limit : @xmath23 when the luminosity is produced by matter being transferred into radiation with some efficiency @xmath24 , there is a second limit : @xmath25 if the primary spectrum of the source extends to @xmath26-ray energies , electron - positron pair production gives a third limit : @xmath27 thermal bremsstrahlung radiation supplies more power than compton process only if : @xmath28 where the temperature of the electrons is @xmath29 @xmath30k .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is larger than the x - ray luminosity in rosat s energy band .",
    "for example , the ratio of the bolometric luminosity of 3c 273 ( padovani & rafanelli 1988 ) , @xmath31 , and the x - ray luminosity in rosat s energy band , @xmath32 , is 14 . in figure [ lx - te ]",
    "we show the soft x - ray luminosity in 0.1 - 2.4 kev versus the exponential time - scale .",

    "[ lx - te ] bremsstrahlung is ruled out as the primary radiation source except in several low luminosity sources because of the observed rapid variability .",
    "the objects whose bolometric luminosity are larger than the eddington limit are ms 01585 + 0019 ( bl ) , pks 0548 - 322 ( hp ) , ms 23409 - 1511 ( nls1 ) , pg 1244 + 026 ( nls1 ) .",
    "these objects may display relativistic effects .",
    "the efficiency factors , @xmath34 , of most objects are larger than 0.007 , which would not be associated with stellar process ( see fig .  [",
    "lx - te ] ) .",
    "it suggests strongly that most agns , at least , have non - thermal and non - stellar processes which are produced by a very efficient central engine .",
    "we also plot @xmath35 versus central black hole masses in figure [ lx - m ] .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath36 .",
    "and the dash line is @xmath37 .",
    "if we assume @xmath33 , we find that the efficiency factor is between 1 to @xmath38 , which is consistent with the results from @xmath39 diagram ( see fig .  [ lx - te ] ) .      under unified model schemes ,",
    "an accretion disk surrounds the central massive black hole in an agn .",
    "there are two instabilities , thermal and viscous , usually occurring in accretion disks .",
    "however , the rapid variability in x - rays can not arise from viscous instability because the viscous time - scale is too long ( mushotzky et al .",
