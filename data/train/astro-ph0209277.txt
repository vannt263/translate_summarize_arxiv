    "if the unified scheme for agn ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) is to be equally successful for objects of high as well as low luminosity , there should exist a large number of qsos whose optical / uv spectra are dominated by narrow emission lines ( type 2 qsos or qso-2s ) . like their seyfert counterparts ,",
    "the broad emission - line regions of such objects are expected to lie within and behind a nominally toroidal obscuring structure , so that broad lines are most readily visible in light polarized by scattering off particles above and below the plane of obscuration . though a few narrow - line objects with quasar luminosities have been found with broad permitted lines in infrared and/or polarized light ( esp . _ iras _ qsos : hines et al . 1995 , 1999 ; young et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is clear that such highly - obscured nuclei are generally not present in classic lists of objects selected via uv excess .    far more promising is the agn catalog being compiled from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; cutri et al .",
    "2001 ) . the fundamental selection criterion of this sample is a color limit ( @xmath2 ) that weeds out stars while at the same time favoring extragalactic sources with substantial reddenning toward their nuclei .",
    "this expectation has received strong support from the discovery of optical linear polarization in a sizeable fraction of 2mass qsos ( in some cases @xmath3 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ) as well as in the detection of large absorbing columns toward the associated nuclear x - ray sources ( wilkes et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the above studies found a surprisingly large number of 2mass qsos with the seemingly paradoxical characteristics of polarization / absorption coupled with prominent type 1 ( broad emission - line ) total - flux spectra , properties that are not easily explained by the simplest models .",
    "nevertheless , the narrow - line 2mass agn provide a number of high - luminosity analogues to seyfert 2 galaxies where one might seek the broad , polarized emission lines that signal the presence of an accretion source powering the nucleus .",
    "this paper reports the first such discovery : a narrow - line qso with an extraordinarily broad scattered h@xmath0  emission line and a polarized flux spectrum that may yield new information on the inner structure of agn .",
    "in survey observations , 2massi j130005.3 + 163214 ( hereafter 2m130005 ) showed a moderately bright and rather red ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) spectrum with a substantial starlight component and prominent narrow emission lines indicating a redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "the 2mass photometry implies an absolute 2@xmath7 m magnitude @xmath8 , well within the range of classical qsos like the pg sample ( schmidt & green 1983 ) . the coordinates of 2m130005 do not correspond with a detection in the _ iras _ point source catalog but the object is an 11.34 mjy first radio source ( gregg et al .",
    "1996 ) and it is known to be absorbed in x - rays ( wilkes et al .",
    "2002 ) . with a galactic latitude of 79@xmath9 , the @xmath10-band polarization of @xmath11 ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) is both intrinsic and tantalizing .",
    "spectropolarimetry was obtained on three occasions between 2001 apr . and 2002 jul . using the instrument spol ( schmidt , stockman & smith 1992 ) attached to the 6.5  m mmt and 2.3  m bok reflector of steward observatory .",
    "due to the smaller collecting area of the bok telescope and an inefficient initial primary mirror coating on the mmt , the earlier data are dwarfed in quality by the latest epoch from the mmt .",
    "all observations used a low - resolution grating providing one full order of spectral coverage , typically @xmath12 .",
    "an entrance slit of 11 ( mmt ; 30 for the bok telescope ) yielded a fwhm resolution of @xmath1317   . at the alt - azimuth mmt ,",
    "the instrument rotator was initially aligned with the parallactic angle and then set to track to a constant equatorial offset throughout the observational sequences .",
    "standard calibration procedures included measurements of a completely polarized source and of interstellar polarization standard stars made with identical setups during the same telescope runs .",
    "data from the individual epochs show qualitatively the same signatures and polarimetric differences that are entirely attributable to different aperture sizes , the latter resulting in variable amounts of dilution from the host galaxy of the qso .",
    "the data were therefore coadded , weighting according to the quality of each epoch .",
    "figure  1 shows the final results in four panels .",
    "a total of 4.1  hr of integration is represented in the figure , dominated by @xmath132  hr with high - reflectance mmt optics .",
    "the total flux spectrum in figure 1 is that of an emission - line galaxy , with prominent [ ] @xmath144959,5007 , [ ] @xmath156300 , [ ] @xmath146548,6584 , [ ] @xmath146717,6731 , and h@xmath16  superimposed on a predominantly stellar continuum .",
    "narrow h@xmath0can also be distinguished in the [ ] blend .",
    "these lines have fwhm of @xmath131000  km  s@xmath1 , i.e. , slightly resolved in our data .",
    "measurements of the line strengths , including the results of deblending of the h@xmath0+[]@xmath146548,6584 complex , yield the following line ratios : @xmath17([]@xmath155007/h@xmath16 ) = 1.03 , @xmath17([]@xmath156584/h@xmath0 ) = 0.14 , @xmath17([]@xmath156717 + 6731/h@xmath0 ) = @xmath180.09 , and @xmath17([]@xmath156300/h@xmath0 ) = @xmath180.62 . in the diagnostic diagrams of veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) ,",
    "the gas responsible for the narrow - line emission is clearly being ionized by an agn .    the outstanding discovery , however , is an extraordinarily broad emission hump in polarized flux , @xmath19 , centered at rest wavelength @xmath13@xmath156630 .",
    "interpreting this as scattered broad h@xmath0  emission , its width ( 18,000  km  s@xmath1  fwhm , or @xmath1335,000  km  s@xmath1  full - width at zero intensity ) is the largest yet found for scattered permitted lines , and equal to the broadest observed in _ any _ agn : cf .",
    "the extreme broad - line radio galaxies 3c  332 ( e.g. , eracleous et al .",
    "1997 ) and 3c  382 ( osterbrock , koski , & phillips 1976 ) .",
    "the broad h@xmath0  line in 2m130005 is redshifted relative to the narrow lines by @xmath133000  km  s@xmath1  and situated atop an extraordinarly red continuum . polarized , narrow [ ] @xmath155007 , [ ] + h@xmath0are also prominent .",
    "it is important to note that the [ ] and [ ] lines are absent in polarized light , even though the data quality is certainly adequate to detect the latter if it were of the same relative strength as the [ ] and [ ] lines . from the line profile comparison shown as an inset in figure 1",
    ", it appears that [ ] @xmath156584 is significantly weaker relative to narrow h@xmath0  in the polarized light spectrum than in total light .",
    "finally , despite all of the structure in polarized flux , the position angle rotates smoothly by less than 15@xmath9 across the observed spectrum .",
    "we have attempted to make a correction for the host galaxy s contribution to the total flux spectrum by scaling a spectrum of the e0 galaxy ngc  3379 ( kennicutt 1992 ) to the strength of the stellar absorption lines in 2m130005 .",
    "our best attempt at cancelling the g and b bands is depicted by the thin line denoted `` agn '' in the bottom panel of figure 1 .",
    "the subtraction is not equally good for all features , but the resulting stellar fraction of 0.8 at @xmath156000 is probably correct to within 10% .",
    "the d feature could not be eliminated for any stellar fraction short of unity , and that choice oversubtracted the blue continuum .",
    "the fact that this feature is marginally apparent in polarized flux suggests that it may be intrinsic to the scattered light .",
    "it is important to note that the broad h@xmath0  component can be discerned as a shallow hump underlying the narrow lines in the residual agn spectrum .",
    "this is true for _ any _ reasonable stellar fraction .",
    "a dotted line indicates the underlying agn continuum in figure 1 .",
    "comparison of the peak brightness of broad h@xmath0  in polarized and total light , @xmath13@xmath20  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath1  @xmath1  _ vs. _ @xmath22  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath1  @xmath1 , implies a degree of polarization for the scattered light of @xmath23 , with the inequality resulting from the possibility that some of the broad line in the total flux spectrum is unscattered .",
    "( this result effectively rules out dichroic extinction  the interstellar mechanism  as the polarizing agent . )",
    "by contrast , the implied polarization of the starlight - subtracted agn continuum is nearly wavelength - independent at @xmath24 over @xmath25    and the continuum - subtracted polarizations of narrow [ ] @xmath155007 and the [ ] + h@xmath0  complex are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . comparing these values to the measurement for broad h@xmath0 , we infer that @xmath2810% of the total light in the narrow lines is scattered .",
    "the discrepancy between broad - line and ( galaxy - corrected ) continuum polarization is reminiscent of the situation in some seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , kay 1994 ; tran 1995 ) , where dilution by hot stars may be an explanation ( e.g. , gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "much has been made of the illumination of particles situated above and below the toroidal plane by the brilliant nucleus . for edge - on perspectives , the scattering of broad - line emission by these particles can provide an indirect view of the nucleus that we detect as polarized lines like the enormous h@xmath0  feature in 2m130005 . the radius of the inner edge of the torus is typically inferred by molecular / maser and hot dust emission at @xmath29  pc .",
    "further reprocessing occurs at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths in a possibly distinct structure of much larger size .",
    "clouds in the inner torus are thought to be individually optically thick at most wavelengths ( krolik & begelman 1988 ) , but the filling factor may be low , so it is unclear what the overall vertical optical depth is to visible - light photons in the inner few hundred pc .",
    "if this region has significant transparency , some of the narrow - line emission from one lobe of a bipolar narrow line region will pass through the central plane to be scattered off particles in the other lobe .",
    "with narrow lines of [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath0  showing a reduced , but significant , fractional polarization at the same position angle as the scattered nuclear emission , it is useful to estimate the importance of this effect .",
    "we write the fraction of the narrow - line emission emitted on one side of the nucleus that is subsequently scattered by the opposite lobe as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the solid angle of the scattering lobe as seen from the emitting lobe , @xmath32 is the effective vertical optical depth of the nuclear region , and @xmath10 is the effective scattering efficiency of the lobe .",
    "we have assumed isotropic emission for this crude exercise .",
    "assuming that the scattering process is also isotropic implies that the observed fluxes are in the same ratio . at the end of  3 , we found that the observed ratio was @xmath130.1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 includes variables such as the optical depth in a lobe and the ratio of scattering to total extinction , and we have difficulty imagining an overall value @xmath33 . for this limit and @xmath32 small",
    ", we find @xmath34 , i.e. , a half - opening angle for a scattering lobe @xmath35 .",
    "while the opening angle is uncomfortably large in comparison to the observed angular extents of scattering and [ ] -emitting lobes in resolved agn , an ionization gradient is expected to exist within each cloud , with high - ionization species like o@xmath36 predominately confined to the surface facing the nuclear engine .",
    "hence , a scattering cloud may see brighter narrow lines than an edge - on observer .",
    "an internal ionization structure also suggests that the backscattering effect would be greater for high - ionization lines than for low - ionization lines , possibly explaining the absence of [ ] @xmath146300,6363 and [ ] @xmath146717,6731 in the polarized light of 2m130005 ( see figure 1 , inset ) . finally , because this explanation places no requirement on the radial location of the scattering particles , the broad - line emission and continuum could be scattered so close to the toroidal plane that the light has difficulty emerging over the `` lip '' of the dusty torus .",
    "the resulting extinction could account for the unusually red polarized continuum depicted in figure 1 .    a more attractive explanation for the observed polarization spectrum may be scattering in an extended narrow - line region that contains a global ionization gradient .",
    "stratification of the narrow - line region has been established in radio - loud agn ( he s , barthel , & fosbury 1993 ) and seyfert galaxies ( filippenko & halpern 1984 ) , among others , and can naturally lead to polarization differences between species ( e.g. , hines et al . 1999 and tran , cohen & villar - martin 2000 for the [ ] and [ ] lines in iras p09104 + 4109 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this mechanism provides no natural explanation for the extremely red continuum in polarized light .",
    "the @xmath37    portion of the latter can be matched to the spectrum of a typical qso using a galactic reddening law with @xmath38  mag . at shorter wavelengths the dereddened spectrum turns up too rapidly , suggesting the onset of a prominent 3000    bump .",
    "of course , if dust grains are the scattering particles , this amount of extinction should be considered a lower limit , since the spectrum might be bluened by the scattering .",
    "a somewhat smaller continuum suppression factor is inferred from a comparison of the measured equivalent width of [ ] @xmath155007 , 330   , with the average for low-@xmath39 qsos from boroson & green ( 1992 ) , @xmath1330   .",
    "however , this result is subject to possible extinction of the narrow - line emission .",
    "heavy extinction of a scattered nuclear spectrum is apparently rare for agn ( see young et al .",
    "1996 for iras",
    "2306 + 0505 ) , and one is left with the impression that the nucleus of 2m130005 is obscured along most sightlines .",
    "as noted above , the broad h@xmath0 emission is redshifted by about 3000  km  s@xmath1with respect to the narrow lines and stellar features .",
    "this is substantially greater than the mean redward shift of h@xmath16  with respect to the systemic velocity measured in the large samples of mcintosh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and zamanov et al .",
    "in fact , the shift observed in 2m130005 is three times larger than the largest value reported in either study .",
    "this may indicate that scattering occurs in an outflowing medium ( see also hines et al .",
    ". however , if we assume that the redshift has a gravitational origin , the ratio of the black hole mass to the characteristic radius of the broad line - emitting region can be estimated as @xmath40 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is similar to the result of an independent derivation , @xmath41 , made under the assumption that the broad - line clouds are in keplerian orbits about the central black hole with a maximum orbital velocity equal to the half width at zero intensity of scattered h@xmath0  ( @xmath1318,000  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "an estimate for the black hole mass in 2m130005 therefore lacks only a size for the broad - line region from , e.g. , reverberation mapping ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) or the overall accretion luminosity .",
    "the latter will be possible using wide - band photometry with _",
    "sirtf_. an x - ray spectrum will soon be obtained , and infrared spectroscopy will be essential for defining the intrinsic spectrum and obscuration of the nucleus of this new type 2 qso .",
