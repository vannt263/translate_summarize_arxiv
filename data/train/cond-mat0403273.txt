    "granular systems exhibit a wide range of intriguing and often counterintuitive phenomena . segregation of two or more species of grains due to vibration or shearing is one such example @xcite .",
    "many mechanisms , including buoyancy , temperature gradients , differing angles of repose , and differing roughness of particles , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , segregation of a vibrated binary mono - layer has been demonstrated in a series of experiments @xcite that imply / suggest the existence of a segregation critical point as the filling fraction is varied , with associated growth of fluctuations and timescales in the vicinity of that point .    in this paper",
    "we propose a phenomenological model of the experimental system which captures its essential features .",
    "we show that there is qualitative agreement between the model and the experiment and , in particular , that the quantitative measures reported in @xcite are of the same form in both cases .",
    "we then use the model to study segregation mechanisms , giving one definite mechanism and demonstrating that a second may also play a role .",
    "the experimental system used in @xcite consists of a smooth horizontal tray of dimensions @xmath0 by @xmath1 vibrated sinusoidally parallel to its major axis at a frequency of @xmath2 and amplitude of @xmath3 .",
    "the grains are high - precision phosphor - bronze spheres ( denoted by @xmath4 in the following ) of radius @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 and poppy seeds ( denoted by @xmath7 in the following ) of average radius and mass @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the poppy seeds are rough , non - spherical polydisperse @xcite particles .",
    "particles placed on the oscillating tray predominantly move periodically with the driving .",
    "they also have some quasi - random component to their motion , caused in the case of the @xmath7s by their non - sphericity which means that they do not roll smoothly but instead slick and slip and scatter .",
    "the @xmath4s are affected less by the driving since they roll as the tray moves beneath them .",
    "however they too , when placed individually on the tray , are seen to have some quasi - random component to their motion .",
    "the overall impression is of a granular bed of agitated particles with the predominant motion being parallel to the driving .",
    "the control parameter used in the experiments was the 2-dimensional filling fraction , termed the compacity @xmath10 , with @xmath11 fixed .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is also important but for simplicity the experiments focussed on @xmath12 and varied @xmath13 .",
    "the system was quasi 2-dimensional in that @xmath14 , high @xmath15 being achieved by poppy seeds riding up and overlapping each other to some extent , although never so much that they were above and overlapping the @xmath4s .",
    "starting from a uniformly mixed initial distribution , the final state reached by the system varies with @xmath15 . for @xmath16",
    "the system remains mixed whilst above that value small mobile segregated clusters of @xmath4s form .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , these clusters grow in size and become anisotropic , forming stripes perpendicular to the direction of driving for @xmath15 large .",
    "for @xmath17 the @xmath4s within these stripes crystallise to form a densely packed hexagonal lattice .",
    "these three phases were termed binary gas , segregation liquid , and segregation crystal .",
    "the existence of a phase transition from the binary gas to segregation liquid , with an associated critical value of @xmath15 , was reported in @xcite .",
    "the details of these results are given in @xcite .",
    "the experimental system has several appealing properties from the point of view of studying granular matter : except at high compacities where stripes form , the final state reached is a function only of the compacity , i.e. the initial conditions are not relevant .",
    "the particles are always in contact with the tray and hence are always effectively ` thermalised ' .",
    "this is in contrast to the behaviour of particles in granular systems such as sandpiles where the grains spend most of their time locked in position , or some vertically vibrated systems where much of the time is spent in free flight @xcite .",
    "the constant thermalisation of the particles , their ability to explore many possible states , and the irrelevance of initial conditions suggests that the system might be a good choice for studying the ` statistical mechanics ' of granular matter .",
    "however detailed balance , equipartition of energy and other rigourous features of equilibrium statistical mechanics are of course not obeyed in this system @xcite .",
    "we here develop a phenomenological model of the experimental system .",
    "the aim is to capture the essential features of the experiment in the model , thereby discovering what those features are and in particular what the segregation mechanism(s )",
    "is(are ) .    the following features are , we believe , necessary : there is a tray of dimensions @xmath18 whose base moves with sinusoidal velocity @xmath19 .",
    "there are two particle species , named @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "the particles moving relative to the tray surface are subject to a frictional force .",
    "the particles feel a randomisation of their velocity caused by their stick - slip motion with the oscillating tray and their non - sphericity ( thermalisation ) .",
    "the particles collide inelastically .",
    "we therefore model the system as 2-dimensional with the particles behaving as hard disks of mass @xmath20 and radius @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the species ( @xmath4 or @xmath7 ) . except during collisions",
    "the particles obey the langevin equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 provides a linear damping .",
    "@xmath26 is gaussian white noise of mean zero and standard deviation @xmath27 and this provides the ` thermalisation ' .",
    "the particles interact through smooth hard - disk inelastic collisions with coefficient of restitution @xmath28 , i.e. in the centre of mass frame , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the line joining the centres of the particles @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for simplicity ,",
    "the disks have been taken to be smooth sided so that angular momentum can be ignored .",
    "a similar model has been used in @xcite to describe colloidal particles driven by an external electrical field .",
    "also @xcite have used a similar model without noise to model granular particles driven by a vertically oscillating air column @xcite .",
    "these are the essentials .",
    "we have also kept the walls of the box stationary for simplicity but modelled the motion of the end walls by considering that in collisions they have a velocity @xmath35 for the left wall and @xmath36 for the right wall .",
    "we felt that this was necessary in order to model the low - density region near each end wall caused by the vigorous collisions with the end walls .",
    "the width of the low - density region is independent of the system size , thus we used @xmath37 rather than @xmath38 in the results described here in order to reduce the finite size effect of this region as the system size is changed .",
    "there are many approximations of the real system made here , the most significant ones are : the friction term @xmath39 is only an approximation , it is chosen as being the simplest possible form .",
    "the noise is in fact due to the stick and slip interactions between the particles and the oscillatory surface , and also their non - sphericity when interacting with each other and with the tray .",
    "we do not try to directly model this since it would require detailed specification of the shape of each particle and its actual interaction with the tray , which is not known .",
    "even a single high - precision phosphor - bronze sphere conducts a quasi - random walk when placed on the oscillating tray , indicating that the randomness can depend on very small imperfections of the particles and the tray ( and possibly also in the driving ) . both because of this immense difficulty and in order to have a reasonably simple model whose behaviour we can understand , we instead choose to include the noise phenomenologically .",
    "we assume that the noise the particles receive is independent of their neighbours and of the phase of the tray cycle , both of which are unlikely to be accurately what happens in the experiments .",
    "the assumption that the noise is gaussian and white is an approximation . for simplicity",
    "we are using a 2-dimensional model , which ignores the overlapping of @xmath7s and the rolling of particles . the particles and walls",
    "are assumed to be smooth and so angular momentum is not considered .",
    "we have ignored the polydispersity of the @xmath7s .",
    "polydispersity was included to check its importance and was found to leave the qualitative behaviour unchanged .",
    "the final approximation is that the coefficients of restitution are constant which is a commonly made one @xcite . despite these simplifications and approximations , in section [ results ]",
    "we show that our phenomenological model captures much of the behaviour observed experimentally .",
    "static parameter values such as mass and size can be measured reasonably accurately , for the poppy seeds we have used the mean values of a sample of measurements @xcite .",
    "dynamic parameters were less accurately known , @xmath40 was estimated from the distances travelled by single particles striking the moving end walls . using the result for the noiseless case , @xmath41 and estimating @xmath42 to be equal to the maximum velocity of the end wall gives approximate values for @xmath40 .",
    "the value for the noise is the hardest to determine since no velocity or accurate @xmath43 path measurements were available .",
    "we merely estimated that the mean square velocity due to the noise , @xmath44 should be equal to @xmath45 where the factor @xmath46 for the @xmath7 case and @xmath47 for the @xmath4 case .",
    "clearly these last estimates are rather crude .",
    "however , extensive study of a wide range of these parameters has shown that the qualitative features are robust to variation of these estimates .",
    "the coefficients of restitution , @xmath48 are estimated to be : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes a side wall .",
    "other values have been studied , but the qualitative behaviour is unchanged .",
    "the main effect of increasing(decreasing ) @xmath28 is to increase(decrease ) the granular temperature which in general merely moves the onset of segregation to slightly higher(lower ) compacity values .",
    "the parameters then are the following .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ parameterstable ] table [ parameterstable ] .",
    "the parameters used for the simulation results described below ( si units are used at all times unless stated otherwise ) . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the @xmath57 and @xmath58 components of @xmath59 .",
    "we have simulated the model via an event driven code @xcite .",
    "the process is as follows :    1 .   for each particle , predict when it will next collide .",
    "2 .   identify the first collision to occur .",
    "3 .   move the particle(s ) involved so that they touch .",
    "update the velocities of the particle(s ) involved ( change in velocity due to damping and noise since they were last updated ) .",

    "record data .",

    "the prediction of collisions assumes that the particle s velocities do not change during their motion .",
    "the error caused by this is small provided that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the time constant of the velocity decay .",
    "we set @xmath64 .",
    "the hard sphere model with inelastic collisions can undergo inelastic collapse @xcite , where the particles undergo an infinite number of collisions in a finite time .",
    "clearly a simulation that implements each collision will ` stall ' in these circumstances .",
    "one way around this unphysical singularity is the tc model @xcite which prevents the collapse by setting @xmath65 for any particle which collided within the last @xmath66 seconds .",
    "we found that for @xmath67 the results did not change . for the results presented here we chose @xmath68 .",
    "the initial conditions were created by running a reduced size system @xmath69 , @xmath70 , of twice the aspect ratio with particles initially placed randomly on a square lattice .",
    "an external force was applied to compress the particles into an area of size @xmath71 .",
    "the particles were then allowed to move in this box without the external force until equilibrated . the initial condition",
    "was then created by tessellating the full system size with 25 replicas of the reduced system .",
    "to prevent long - range order the replicas were randomly inverted in both the @xmath57 and @xmath58 directions ( the differing noises received by the particles in conjunction with the chaotic behaviour of the particles would rapidly remove any correlations in any case ) . during this stage ,",
    "both particle species had the same properties , including @xmath65 , except for their radii .",
    "this method produced initial conditions which appeared to be as homogeneous as those for the experiment .",

    "we will show that the available area is relevant to noise segregation .",

    "[ voronoihistogramsderiveddata ] ]    the results presented here show that our model reproduces the segregation and its qualitative behaviour with @xmath15 of binary gas , segregated liquid , and segregated stripes as seen experimentally . this behaviour is not immediately obvious from the model rules - it emerged from the set of rules which we believed contained the important microscopic features of the experiment . we have also shown that the msw as a function of time and its saturated value as a function of compacity behave in a qualitatively similar manner to the experiment .",

    "thus @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus the @xmath7s would like to move a distance of order their radius during a cycle whilst the @xmath4s hardly move . consider a state of only @xmath7s , if we remove the noise then all the @xmath7s move in the same sinusoidal way , if we transfer to the ( non - inertial ) reference frame in which they are at rest , we see that this is identical to the state with no sinusoidal driving ( apart from edge effects at the walls ) for which the dissipation causes the particles to be stationary .",
    "the same can be said of a state of only @xmath4s . in a mixed state ,",
    "however , the @xmath7s will collide with the @xmath4s and the system will ` scatter ' into a different state .",
    "stable states , i.e. those that do not undergo further scatterings , will be those for which the @xmath4s are separated from the @xmath7s in the @xmath57 direction by distances of at least the amplitude of the @xmath7s oscillations . for the packing fractions considered here , this can only happen by the two species segregating into domains .",
    "the fact that the area available to the @xmath7s increases with time is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "this argument only holds when the driving is not too large compared to the dissipation .",
    "for example if the amplitude of oscillation were of order the system size then it would not be valid .",
    "an argument similar to this was also given in @xcite .",
    "we have studied systems with very low noise and the results obtained agree with the heuristic argument given above .",
    "the addition of noise , which causes particles to diffuse , will tend to cause mixing .",
    "thus there is a competition between the periodic driving which causes segregation and the noise which prevents it .",
    "this is shown in the results presented below .",
    "for the standard parameters but with @xmath103 , the system segregates for all the compacities studied in section [ results ] ( see figure [ standardparametersbutlownoise ] ) , indicating that , as expected , the noise acts to prevent segregation . to confirm this we then gave the two species identical parameters ( the @xmath7 parameters ) and set all @xmath65 .",
    "the only difference was that the @xmath7s experienced the periodic driving term @xmath104 whilst the @xmath4s did not .",

    "varying our control parameter , @xmath13 , causes us to go from a mixed to a segregated state because increasing @xmath13 both reduces the granular temperature ( since it increases the number of collisions which are highly inelastic ) and also increases the ` pressure ' that the @xmath4s feel due to collisions with a greater number of oscillating @xmath7s .",
    "figure [ allsameexceptris0pt1andonlypsfeelsidetoside ] shows results for all properties set to @xmath7 values including all @xmath112 but with only the @xmath7s feeling the periodic driving , showing that the results remain of the same form for @xmath113 .",

    "[ allsameexceptris0pt1andonlypsfeelsidetoside ] ]    finally , we find that the system with standard parameters does not segregate if the oscillatory motion is turned off .",
    "these results show that the differential oscillatory driving can cause segregation and present good evidence that it is the responsible mechanism in the system in conjunction with the noise which acts to prevent segregation .",
    "the transition from a mixed to a segregated state as @xmath15 is varied is due to the compacity changing the relative strengths of these two competing effects .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the segregation mechanism might be similar to the depletion interaction in equilibrium binary systems @xcite . as an example consider a colloidal suspension containing non - adsorbing polymers . in the ideal case where there are no forces present",
    ", the free energy depends only on the entropy of the system . treating the polymers as spheres @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that each colloidal particle has an ` excluded volume ' around it of radius @xmath115 which the centre of the polymer can not enter .",
    "thus the volume available to the polymers is the volume of the system less the excluded volumes around the colloidal particles and the system edges .",
    "however , the excluded volumes overlap when colloidal particles are closer than @xmath116 , thus the volume available to the polymers , and hence their entropy , is larger if the colloidal particles are close to each other .",
    "this entropic ` effective potential ' can be large enough to cause the colloid to coagulate .",
    "this mechanism was one reason for measuring the area available to the @xmath7s in our simulations .",
    "segregation has been observed in simulations of hard spheres of two different sizes @xcite for large size ratios , e.g. @xmath117 , and also experimentally in binary mixtures of hard sphere colloids @xcite .",
    "we may equivalently view the entropy argument from the kinetic point of view .",
    "two particles which are close to each other such that no third particle may fit in the space between them will feel a pressure on all sides due to collisions with other particles @xmath118 on their neighbouring sides .",
    "thus the particles feel an effective attractive force .",
    "this pressure argument may be extended to systems that are not in equilibrium , for example the granular experiment studied here .",
    "the size ratio @xmath119 is much closer to unity than for simulated equilibrium segregating systems @xcite , implying that the difference in size alone does not cause segregation .    in our out - of - equilibrium system",
    "there are several possible differences between the two species besides a difference in size . for our system",
    ", it seemed possible that the lighter , faster moving @xmath7s might , through the differential pressure mechanism , cause the @xmath4s to coagulate even in the absence of periodic driving .",
    "as stated before , this was not observed for the standard parameters .",
    "we therefore increased the noise of the @xmath7s and/or reduced the noise of the @xmath4s in order to increase the @xmath7 to @xmath4 temperature and hence pressure ratio .",
    "noticeable segregation occurred over a wide range of compacity values for @xmath120 , for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and also for @xmath123 . whilst the first of these cases is outside the reasonable parameter range ,",
    "the second and third are at parameters which might be physical .",
    "figure [ figanexampleoftrueparamstimes0pt05segregation ] shows an example for the third case . notice that many of the @xmath4s have coagulated at the walls as",
    "one would expect since the pressure argument for two - particle attraction also applies to the particle - wall case .",
    "although this marked congregation at the walls is observed in experiments with colloids , it is not observed in the experiments of @xcite .",
    "re - introducing the periodic driving of the end walls prevented congregation at the @xmath124 walls whose large momentum transfer to the particles , as stated earlier , gives rise to low - density regions next to them .",
    "however , for all parameter values studied that displayed segregation with no driving , the @xmath4s still congregated at the @xmath125 walls when the driving was turned on . since stripes that touch the top and bottom walls are stable in the experiment , it seems unlikely that agitation due to the motion of the top and bottom walls is what prevents the liquid domains from coagulating there .",
    "s for the standard parameters but with no periodic driving and @xmath123 .",
    "notice the domains of @xmath4s at the edges of the system .",

    "@xmath7s are coloured black .",
    "[ figanexampleoftrueparamstimes0pt05segregation ] ]    it is possible to remove this experimentally unobserved effect by giving @xmath126 and @xmath127 differing values such that @xmath128 is lower and @xmath129 is higher than that needed to produce segregation .",
    "whilst we had previously kept @xmath130 for simplicity , it is reasonable that @xmath131 since random motion caused by sticking and slipping is likely to be larger in the direction of driving .",
    "this extra modification produces segregation without @xmath4s congregating on the walls ( provided that the @xmath124 walls are ` driving ' ) whether there is periodic driving of the tray base or not .",
    "figure [ figanexampleofpressuresegregationwithoutgroupingatwalls ] shows an example .",

    "note that the area of the system is @xmath106 that of the experimental system .",
    "@xmath7s are coloured black .",
    "[ figanexampleofpressuresegregationwithoutgroupingatwalls ] ]    we therefore conclude that this differential pressure segregation mechanism may play a role in the experiment .",
    "we had to ` tune ' the parameters which implies that the mechanism is less robust than the oscillatory driving mechanism .",
    "accurate experimental measurements of the parameters would help to resolve whether this mechanism is indeed present . directly distinguishing the two mechanisms mentioned would require accurate tracking of all particles and their collisions , coupled with investigations of other binary mixtures in order to get readings for different noise to side - to - side movement ratios .",
    "this is likely to prove a difficult task and at present all we can conclude is that differential pressure segregation may play a role in the experiment in addition to the differential driving discussed above .    to demonstrate that different temperatures alone can cause segregation",
    "we have studied two species with standard @xmath7 parameters but all @xmath65 .",
    "the temperature difference is produced by @xmath134 and also setting all @xmath135 so that the time constants @xmath136 are sufficiently small that particles remember the temperature of their heat baths rather than only the temperature of their previous collision partners .",
    "this imposed temperature difference causes coagulation of the lower temperature particles as shown in figure [ figdifferenttscausecoarsening ] .",
    "whilst these parameters are very different from the standard ones , they clearly show another segregation mechanism in a nonequilibrium system and that the heuristic arguments regarding pressure differences out of equilibrium are valid .",
    "s after 96 seconds due only to temperature difference tp=1600*tc .",
    "the system is still evolving , the groups of @xmath4s in the centre will eventually attach to the sides of the system .",
    "note that the area of the system is @xmath106 that of the experimental system .",
    "@xmath7s are coloured black . [ figdifferenttscausecoarsening ] ]      one further possible mechanism",
    "is that the noise of the particles is correlated among the particles but differently for the @xmath4s and the @xmath7s .",
    "this could cause segregation in the same way as the periodic driving since it also would produce different collective motions for the two species .",
    "the correlation could be caused by , for example , the @xmath7s all changing from sticking to the tray base to slipping at the same time in the periodic cycle .",
    "whilst this mechanism is at least plausible , the collective motions due to correlated noise and due to periodic driving ( which would have caused the correlated noise in the first place ) would not be clearly distinguishable . at the level of this phenomenological model which breaks the driving into a periodic and a noise component , any such mechanism is , therefore , not meaningful .",
    "it is possible that there are other segregation mechanisms not discussed here , however we believe that we have considered the ones most likely to be relevant in the experiment .",
    "in this paper we have introduced and numerically studied a ( relatively ) simple phenomenological model of a recently reported granular segregation experiment .",
    "we have measured the same quantities as measured experimentally and shown that our model reproduces most of the features of the experiment , the most important being a transition from a mixed to a segregated state as the compacity is increased .",
    "this behaviour is not _ a priori _ built into the model - it emerges from the simple rules governing the motion of the particles .",
    "this is significant as it shows that we have a set of basic features necessary for an explanation of the experimentally observed behaviour .",
    "we then used our model to investigate and identify segregation mechanisms and elucidate the experimental behaviour .",
    "we showed that the transition from mixed to segregated state in the model is caused by competition between the different driving felt by the @xmath4s and @xmath7s , which acts to cause segregation , and the noise , which acts to prevent segregation .",
    "we are led to conclude that this is also the main mechanism present in the experiment .",
    "we have also considered and demonstrated segregation due to different pressures and shown that it is possible that this might play a role in the experiment .",
    "the differential driving segregation mechanism is applicable to many binary driven systems @xcite .",
    "this work goes some way to explaining the intriguing experimental results of @xcite .",
    "experiments with other particle types in conjunction with more accurate experimental measurements , particularly with regard to particle positions and velocities , should allow more accurate comparisons with our model and also refinements of the model .",
    "in particular more accurate values for the parameters used .    now that we have shown our model to be relevant to the experimental system , it is possible to use it further to investigate the granular statistical mechanics of this type of system . in particular",
