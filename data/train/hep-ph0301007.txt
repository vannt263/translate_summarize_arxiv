    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite are an infinite system of coupled integral equations for the green functions of a quantum field theory . in principle",
    ", their solution contains all possible information in the theory .",
    "however , the dse for an @xmath3-point green function involves various other green functions of order @xmath4 .",
    "so to make progress , the system must be truncated at some stage and models must be made for the unknown green functions .",
    "for example , in qcd , the dse for the quark propagator involves not only the quark propagator , but also the gluon propagator and the full quark - gluon vertex , both of which need to be calculated or modelled in some way for the equation to provide a solution for the quark propagator .    notwithstanding the need for model input , the dses provide a relativistically covariant , non - perturbative approach to field theory that has enjoyed considerable success in recent years . in qcd , models based on the dses are able to describe accurately many facets of meson and , more recently , baryon physics in free space and at nonzero temperature and density @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent dse studies are now providing insight into the infrared behaviour of qcd green functions and the nature of confinement @xcite .",
    "sophisticated studies have also been made of the dses in qed and other theories @xcite .",
    "almost all dse based studies to date focus on the equations for some of the two point functions of the theory , making various models for the remaining two- and three - point functions . in this paper , we examine a simple theory and solve a larger system of equations .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 scalar field theory with a munczek - nemirovsky ( mn ) model propagator for the @xmath2 particle ( which we introduce in sec .",
    "[ model ] ) and solve the coupled dses for the @xmath1 propagator and 3-point vertex .",
    "an exact solution is possible in this model because relations amongst the green functions allow the remaining system of dses to close without truncation .",
    "we also investigate the effect that imposing various truncations has on the solutions .",
    "the central result of this analysis is that there is no real solution to the untruncated model unless the coupling is imaginary despite the model having solutions for real couplings when additional truncations of the dses are made .",
    "this is shown by the divergence of the diagrammatic expansion of the vertex .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured in the following manner .",
    "we introduce the details of the model in sec .",
    "[ model ] , and the various truncations we employ in sec .",

    "we consider the theory of two scalar fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , described by the interaction lagrangian : @xmath5 and work in euclidean space .",
    "this scalar theory is primarily studied as a precursor for an investigation in qcd , but is also interesting in its own right and is sometimes used as a simplified description of meson - nucleon interactions .",
    "we define the momentum- ( and position- ) space propagators for the fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) respectively .",
    "these objects satisfy the dyson - schwinger equations : @xmath10 and @xmath11 where the bare propagators are @xmath12 for the @xmath1 field of mass @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the @xmath2 field ( mass @xmath15 ) .",

    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",

    "the dependence of these equations on the vertex function @xmath20 means that they do not form a closed , computable system .",
    "an often used approach is to truncate the system at this level by introducing a model for @xmath20 and solve the resulting equations @xcite .",
    "we investigate various possible truncations in sec .",

    "( [ vertex ] ) , it is possible to truncate the system at a higher level , modelling @xmath21 rather than @xmath24 .",
    "this automatically ensures that the dyson - schwinger and bound state equations are truncated consistently .    in this paper",
    ", we will assume that the propagator for the @xmath2 field is constant throughout space - time .",
    "in momentum space this results in @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( constant ) strength of the correlation .",
    "this is analogous to the approximation of munczek and nemirovsky ( mn ) @xcite which has often been applied to model qcd @xcite .",
    "it was originally motivated as a simple means with which to provide the necessary infrared enhancement in the kernel of the quark dse of qcd .",
    "however its physical foundations are fairly tenuous as it does not allow momentum transfer between quarks or their consequent scattering .",
    "whilst it has this and other difficulties @xcite , it also has the distinct advantage that the various integral equations of the ds system reduce to algebraic equations and it remains an interesting model .    with this scalar mn model in place",
    ", we will explore varying possible truncations in the following section and then show that they are unnecessary by solving the full set of equations and calculating the exact solutions ( where they exist ) in sec .",

    "in this section , we shall consider a number of truncations that can be applied to solve the dses above , each of which successively improves on the last .",
    "for simplicity , we omit the momentum dependence of propagators and vertices in what follows since the mn model decouples all differing momenta .",
    "in fact , the momentum only enters into the propagator and vertex dses though the bare propagator , @xmath27 , so @xmath24 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath21 depend only on @xmath30 .",

    ", we shall use the original ( unprimed ) quantities and only consider @xmath37 .      for this scalar theory ,",
    "the rainbow truncation is defined by @xmath38 in qcd , when the analogous truncation of the quark dse is combined with the ladder truncation of mesonic bethe - salpeter equations , the resulting models successfully describe the pseudo - scalar and light vector meson spectrum @xcite with additional higher - order corrections providing only minor modifications @xcite . if the rainbow truncation is combined with the munczek - nemirovsky propagator , eq .",

    "as no momentum flows along @xmath2 propagators and there are no complicating dirac structures , every diagram at a given order contributes the same factor , for example , the one- and two- loop vertices are given by @xmath42 respectively , where the factor of @xmath43 arises from diagram counting ( see sec .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) .",
    "these additional contributions to the vertex are not perturbative corrections ; they involve the full propagator functions .",
