    "this work is inspired by the problem of predicting the effects of earthquakes in cities .",
    "it is known that the most dangerous effects are produced in cities built on soft underground underlain by a hard substratum .",
    "a simple model of the city is considered herein in which the buildings are absent ( i.e. , the ground is flat ) , the soft underground is constituted by a homogeneous , soft layer overlying , and in welded contact with , a homogeneous , hard substratum .",
    "this configuration is solicited by a sh plane body wave and the object is to determine the time history of response on the ground , preferably in a numerically - efficient , physically - understandable manner .",
    "in the following , we shall be concerned with the determination of the vectorial displacement field @xmath0 on , and underneath , the ground in response to a seismic solicitation . in general",
    ", @xmath0 is a function of the spatial coordinates , incarnated in the vector @xmath1 and time @xmath2 , so that @xmath3 .",
    "we first carry out our analysis in the frequency domain , and thus search for @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the angular frequency .",
    "fourier analysis tells us that @xmath6 and @xmath4 are related by @xmath7 wherein it should be noted that @xmath4 is a generally - complex function , whereas @xmath6 is a real function .",
    "the second step will therefore deal with the computation of the integral in ( [ fourier ] ) .",
    "since everything is invariant with @xmath8 , the analysis takes place in the @xmath9 ( sagittal ) plane depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    in this figure",
    ": @xmath10 designates the ( trace of the ) interface between the substratum ( half - space domain @xmath11 ) and the soft layer ( laterally - unbounded domain @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 designates the ( trace of the ) flat ground .",
    "the medium @xmath14 above the latter is air , assumed to be the vacumn for the purpose of the analysis .",
    "the media in the layer and substratum are the elastic ( or viscoelastic ) solids @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the incident plane wave propagates in @xmath11 toward the the interface @xmath10 and the ground @xmath13 . since the latter is stress - free ( i.e. , the normal and tangential components of traction are nil on the boundary ) , the total displacement field vanishes in the region @xmath17 above the boundary ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "[ ptb ]        one can always choose the cartesian coordinate system so that the wavevector associated with the incident shear wave ( the subscript @xmath18 will constitute a reminder that we deal with shear = transverse waves in the following ) lies in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "this is assumed herein and signifies that the displacement associated with this wave is perpendicular to the @xmath9 plane and therefore lies in a horizontal plane .",
    "thus , the incident wave is a shear wave and the associated displacement is horizontal ; i.e. , a shear - horizontal ( sh ) wave .",
    "moreover , the motion associated with this wave is , due to the choice of the cartesian reference system , independent of the coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that the resultant total motion induced by this incident wave is independent of @xmath8 , i.e. , the boundary value problem is 2d , so that it is sufficient to look for the displacement field in the @xmath9 plane . actually , since we already know that the total displacement vanishes in the half plane above the boundary we must look for the total displacement field ( hereafter designated by @xmath19 ) only in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "hereafter , we designate the density and lam parameters in @xmath20 by @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) respectively .",
    "the mathematical translation of the boundary value problem in the _ space - frequency domain _ is : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 wherein @xmath36 is the ( unknown ) diffracted field in @xmath37 , @xmath38 the kronecker delta symbol , and : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 being the angle of incidence with respect to the @xmath42 axis .",

    "since we consider only the case of geological interest in which the substratum is harder than the layer , the s - wave phase velocity in the substratum is larger than the s - wave phase velocity in the layer , which means that @xmath89 and consequently @xmath90 is real , so that both @xmath87 and @xmath86 are body waves . thus , the field in the layer is also composed of two body waves .",
    "an important corollary of the previous remarks is ( in the case of geological interest ) that an incident ( plane ) body wave in the substratum can only excite ( plane ) body waves in both the substratum and the layer . thus , if we want a surface wave to be excited somewhere underneath the ground , then we have to introduce some sort of modification of either the excitation , the nature of the media , or the nature of the boundary condition on the ground .",

    "this is the reason why the pole - residue convolution method was proposed .",

    "the fact that the essential features ( peak values and duration , amongst others ) of the time history are directly - related to the complex eigenvalues of the structure is the essential result we were aiming at in this contribution .",

    "the pole - residue convolution expression of the time history appears to be similar to the one obtained by the power series method , but the latter method is not applicable when @xmath396 for real eigenvalues in the absence of dissipation ( i.e. , the situation in which it is possible to excite love modes ( groby and wirgin 2005a , b ) ) ; moreover , the power series method does not enable one to predict the duration in an obvious way .",
    "some of the numerical results included in this work are rather unexpected .",
    "for instance , the time histories given in figs .",
    "[ rectrickb18 ] , [ resrickb19 ] , [ poisrick20 ] have quite long durations that one would not expect to occur for a case in which modes can not be excited . actually , this long duration is due to the fact that the only attenuative action in this work is the one due to radiation damping",
    ". the duration would be shorter if material dissipation ( i.e. , viscoelasticity ) were taken into account in the layer and/or the contrast between @xmath113 and @xmath114 were smaller .",
    "the main result of this contribution is that the three methods give rise to the same solutions for a large variety of scattering configurations .",
    "the complex frequency pole - residue convolution method turns out to be the most interesting method since : i ) it is numerically - efficient , ii ) it is explicit as concerns the understanding and quantification of the duration of the time domain response , iii ) it can be employed even in the case in which genuine resonances ( due to mode excitation ) are produced .",

    "<S> we treat the case of a flat stress - free surface ( i.e. , the ground in seismological applications ) separating air from a homogeneous , isotropic , solid substratum overlain by a homogeneous , isotropic , solid layer ( in contact with the ground ) solicited by a sh plane body wave incident in the substratum . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is first carried out in the frequency domain and subsequently in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency domain response is _ normal _ in that no resonances are excited ( a resonance is here understood to be a situation in which the response is infinite in the absence of dissipation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the translation of this in the time domain is that the scattered pulse is of relatively - short duration . </S>",
    "<S> the duration of the pulse is shown to be largely governed by radiation damping which shows up in the imaginary parts of the complex eigenfrequencies of the configuration . </S>",
    "<S> three methods are elaborated for the computation of the time history and give rise to the same numerical solutions for a large variety of configurations of interest in the geophysical setting under the hypothesis of non - dissipative , dispersionless media . </S>",
    "<S> the method appealing to the complex eigenfrequency representation is shown to be the simplest and most physically - explicit way of obtaining the time history ( under the same hypothesis ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is particularly suited for the case in which modes can be excited as occurs when the incident wave is not plane or the boundary condition is not of the stress - free variety for all transverse coordinates on the ground plane . </S>"
