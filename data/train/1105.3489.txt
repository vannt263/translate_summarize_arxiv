    "although the absolute value of the quasiparticle velocity @xmath10 can not be altered by the electric field due to the `` ultra - relativistic '' dispersion relation * * , * * the orientation of the velocity can be influenced by the applied field .",

    "these two sources of current , namely creation of moving charges by the electric field ( polarization ) and their reorientation ( acceleration ) are responsible for the creation of a stable current .",
    "agreement over the qualitative explanation notwithstanding , determination of the value of the minimal dc conductivity at dirac point in the limit of zero temperature had undergone a period of experimental and theoretical uncertainty . after the value in graphene on substrate",
    "was measured to be about @xmath13 @xcite , it was shown in experiments on suspended samples @xcite that the zero temperature limit was not achieved and in fact that these early samples had too many charged `` puddles '' , so that they represented an average around the neutrality or the dirac point .",

    "was applied to the tight binding model of graphene @xcite to resolve this `` regularization ambiguity '' .",
    "it consists of considering the ballistic evolution of the current density in time after a sudden or gradual switching on of the electric field .",
    "the result within linear response is that the current settles very fast , on the microscopic time scale of @xmath17 @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the hopping energy ) , on the value of @xmath20 .",

    "this is in contrast to dissipative systems , in which the linear response limit can be taken directly at infinite time .",

    "analytic and numerical solutions of the tight binding model@xcite , as well as of the dirac model describing the physics near the dirac point demonstrated@xcite that at @xmath29 the electron - hole pairs creation becomes dominant and is well described by an adaptation of the well - known ( non - analytic in @xmath30 ) schwinger electron - positron pair creation rate @xmath31the difference with the original derivation @xcite in the context of particle physics is that the fermions are 2 + 1 dimensional and `` massless '' , thus magnifying the effect .",
    "the polarization current is @xmath32 and therefore schwinger s creation rate leads to a linear increase with time@xcite : @xmath33    the physics of pair creation is highly non - perturbative and non - linear in nature and therefore , instead of the linear response , schwinger found an exact formula using functional methods .",
    "the rate can be intuitively understood using the much simpler instanton approach originally proposed in the context of particle physics @xcite ( extended later to low dimensions @xcite ) , but is known in fact in condensed matter physics as the landau - zener tunneling probability dora10,santoro , vandecasteele10 . in particle physics it is extremely difficult to observe schwinger s creation rate and it would be interesting to establish experimentally this dynamical phase in low dimensional condensed matter physics featuring the massless dirac quasiparticle spectrum like graphene or novel materials sharing with it the massless dirac spectrum like topological insulators or tuned semiconductor heterojunctions topins .",
    "of course transport phenomena at rather large fields always have a background related to possible influence of leads , disorder and thermal effects like local heating , etc .    in this note",

    "now we elaborate on a number of related issues and comment on the experimental feasibility of exploring the schwinger phase physics .",
    "we start with a qualitative discussion of the rather unusual physics arising at strong applied fields , when the pair recombination becomes an important relaxation channel .",
    "even if the ballistic time and the relaxation time are very large , schwinger s dynamical pair creation phase can not persist for a long time at large field since density of charges ( or both signs ) becomes large .",
    "when the density of quasiparticles reaches the order of @xmath124 a neutral electron - hole plasma is created @xcite ( like in some semiconductor systems under irradiation ) . in this",
    "state electrostatic interactions ( despite being screened at large distances ) become dominant , as was discussed extensively in connection with electron - positron pairs creation in quantum electrodynamics@xcite . when electrons and holes are close enough they strongly attract each other effectively facilitating the recombination process .",
    "the rate therefore far exceeds the one calculated within perturbation theory in section iii .",
    "let us first estimate when this state is achieved at experimentally accessible situations .",
    "assuming the schwinger pair creation rate , eq.([schwinger_rate ] ) , the density will approach @xmath125 at times of order @xmath126 . with a moderate field value of @xmath22 @xcite , the plasma time @xmath127 @xmath29 exceeds the ballistic time of the @xmath128 long sample ( and probably also the relaxation time in current experiments on graphene ) . yet with higher achievable fields @xmath129 @xcite , the plasma time is reduced to @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "therefore one expects that the `` radiation friction '' dissipation channel opens up : electron - hole pairs annihilate emitting photons , which take energy out of the graphene sheet and thus a new ohmic behavior is reached .",
    "this is roughly the ballistic time range for which the emission was calculated in section iii .",
    "of course , due to the coulomb attraction enhancement of the recombination the intensity becomes grossly underestimated in the plasma regime .",
    "the pair density will have to be re - calculated via boltzmann equations ; this will be done in a separate publication .",
    "one however might expect qualitatively that this conductivity  in the `` second '' ohmic regime certainly exceeds @xmath133 and is likely to reach several times @xmath133 .",
    "data presented in ref.@xcite for _ clean _ samples , see figs . 3 and 12 therein , is consistent with the linear ( ohmic ) i - v curve at such conductivity value .",
    "however the experimental situation in the transport experiment is rather complex as discussed next .      in this subsection",
    "we use the above `` radiation friction '' scenario to discuss whether there is a clear and unambiguous signature of the schwinger s pair creation phase in transport experiments . in a series of remarkable experiments",
    "the nonlinear i - v were measured at high electric fields of the order @xmath25 at room temperature@xcite .",
    "the samples were treated in such a way that , despite being non - suspended , the typical charge asymmetry did not appear and the dirac point was accessed convincingly at zero gate voltage ( this demonstrates high quality and is in variance with most samples on substrate ) .",
    "the i - v curves were studied in various high and low mobility samples ( up to @xmath134 ) and effects of disorder were partially controlled by irradiating the samples .",
    "the samples were @xmath135 long and rather narrow @xmath136 and the four - probe technique was applied .",
    "although a nonlinear i - v dependence @xmath137 with exponent @xmath138 was observed at dirac point , surprisingly the nonlinearity disappeared in the highest mobility samples . in these experiments",
    "the ballistic time @xmath27 is much larger than @xmath139 at the highest applied voltage of @xmath140 .",
    "unfortunately the crossover voltages , namely when @xmath141 or @xmath142were not probed since at room temperature @xmath143 .",
    "as argued in the previous subsection the radiation friction causes a second ohmic regime and the i - v curve in the clean samples is expected to be linear .",
    "it is disorder that might have caused the observed nonlinearity in irradiated samples .",
    "this requires an additional theoretical study that includes the effect of pair recombination .",
    "as argued above it becomes as important as the landau - zener - schwinger pair creation process at such currents .",
    "to summarize , electron - hole pairs are copiously created via landau - zener - schwinger mechanism near the dirac points in graphene or similar 2d electronic systems by an applied electric field , provided the available ballistic time exceeds @xmath29 , eq.([t_nl ] ) .",
    "the recombination into photons produces a characteristic signal proportional to @xmath144 at frequencies of order @xmath77 that enables unintrusive and unambiguous experimental observation of the schwinger phenomenon .",
    "the angular and polarization dependence of the emitted photons with respect to the graphene sheet was calculated . at very high currents and sufficiently long ballistic times",
    "the recombination process becomes greatly enhanced by the electron - hole attraction and the radiation becomes an effective channel of dissipation , the radiation friction .",
    "the calculation can be trivially extended to any system with a dirac point - like spectrum as double layer graphene and the recently synthesized family of materials called `` topological insulators '' @xcite in which surface excitations are similar to those in graphene with the notable exception of chirality .",
    "schwinger s mechanism is also expected in these materials since the mechanism does not involve chirality ( left and right movers contribute equally to the emission rate of graphene ) .",
    "these materials have an advantage of not being strictly two dimensional , although ballistic times might be shorter at present .",
