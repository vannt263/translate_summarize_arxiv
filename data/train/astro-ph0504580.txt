    "the mass function of dark matter halos is routinely measured in numerical simulations . if one assumes that the galaxy luminosity is proportional the halo mass , the abundance of galaxies at the faint and the bright ends of the luminosity range is significantly below the expected @xcite .",
    "semianalytic models of galaxy formation , including those attempting to account for feedback and heating processes , generally do not explain the shape of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    ", we studied the relation between the luminosity of the central galaxy and the mass of dark matter halo occupied by the galaxy ( henceforth , the @xmath2@xmath3 relation ) .",
    "we suggested that the flattening of this relation in halos above @xmath4 is a consequence of the progressive decline in efficiency with which central galaxies accrete satellites in the course of hierarchical merging .",
    "we demonstrated that to explain the @xmath2@xmath3 relation , ongoing galaxy growth in massive halos via gas cooling and star formation need not be invoked .",
    "therefore , we depart from the classical picture in which giant galaxies accrue mass continuously ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and support the picture in which a bulk of the stellar mass is produced in smaller halos in which virial shocks do not raise the gas temperature to the virial temperature @xcite .    here",
    ", we demonstrate that the luminosity function of galaxies can be derived from two simple premises : ( 1 ) the luminosities of central galaxies in halos of a given mass possess a log - normal intrinsic scatter with a mean and a dispersion identified with measured values , and ( 2 ) when the total luminosity of galaxies inside a halo exceeds that of the central galaxy , the luminosities of satellite galaxies are distributed as a power - law .",
    "these two assumptions yield a lf of the @xcite type , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the slope of the lf at the faint end , and @xmath0 is usually thought of as a characteristic luminosity scale .",
    "our construction of the lf is compatible in spirit with the ab initio synthesis of the conditional stellar mass function in @xcite , and differs from the modeling of conditional luminosity function ( clf ) in @xcite , where the schechter form was assumed a priori .",
    "log - normal scatter of galaxy luminosities in _ low - mass _ halos was invoked by @xcite to explain the scatter in the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation @xcite . here , we show that the log - normal scatter is crucial for explaining the turnover of the schechter lf at the _ bright - end_. our approach is opposite to that of @xcite , who used the lf to extract information about the @xmath2@xmath3 relation .",
    "we instead use the observationally determined @xmath2@xmath3 relation to reconstruct the lf .",
    "we also calculate the clf , and illustrate how the lf is built from the clf .    in   [ sec :",
    "correlation ] , we describe the construction of the galaxy lf . in   [ sec : discussion ] , we compare our lf with the observed lfs of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "we adopt the current concordance cosmological model consistent with wmap @xcite with a hubble constant of @xmath7 unless stated otherwise .",
    "the clf , denoted by @xmath8 , is the average number of galaxies with luminosities between @xmath9 and @xmath10 that reside in halos of mass @xmath3 .",
    "we separate the clf into terms associated with central and satellite galaxies , @xmath11 , where the central galaxy clf is a log - normal distribution in luminosity with a mean @xmath12 and dispersion @xmath13 @xmath14 ^ 2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the satellite clf is a power law @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are normalization factors .",
    "the separation into central and satellite galaxies is motivated by the halo model for galaxy statistics @xcite .",
    "the normalization @xmath16 of the central galaxy clf is fixed such that @xmath18 equals the average total luminosity of galaxies @xmath19 in a halo of mass @xmath3 .",
    "the normalization @xmath17 of the satellite clf can be obtained by defining @xmath20 and requiring that @xmath21 , where the minimum luminosity of a satellite is @xmath22,while we generally set @xmath23 .",
    "we find below from an analysis the cluster lf that a more appropriate value for the maximal luminosity of satellites is between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "our reconstruction is independent of the exact value assumed for @xmath22 , as long as it lies in the range @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath19 equals @xmath12 for @xmath27 , and thus @xmath28 on these scales .",
    "the remaining two free parameters are @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; we discuss the determination of these parameters in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we adopt the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ; st ) mass function @xmath31 for dark matter halos as it approximates numerical simulations better than the @xcite function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the usual , unconditional lf",
    "is then given by @xmath32 the clf represents galaxy statistics better than the lf when wide - field data sets are available in which redshifts are measured for tens of thousands of galaxies @xcite .    for @xmath12 , we make use of the observed central galaxy luminosity measurements over six orders of magnitude in luminosity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sloan]a ) .",
    "following @xcite , we employ a fitting function of the form @xmath33^{1/d}}\\ , .\\ ] ] for central luminosities , the parameters are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "these values are different than in @xcite ; their fit was constructed from the @xmath40-band luminosities of 2df , while we use the @xmath41-band luminosities . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the relation is compatible with that derived in @xcite . for total luminosities , we also use the fitting formula in equation ( [ eq : fitting ] ) , but with @xmath43 . at the massive end",
    ", the total luminosity can alternatively be described as a power - law .",
    "the constructed lf does not change if power - law behavior is enforced there .",
    "this is because the total lf ( including field , group , and cluster galaxies ) is dominated by central galaxies on any scale .",
    "the overall shape of the lf is thus sensitive to the shape of the @xmath2@xmath3 relation .",
    "in figure [ fig : sloan]b , we show the constructed lf in which the galaxies in halos in the mass range @xmath44 have been taken into account .",
    "we also plot the contributions to clf from central galaxies and the contribution to lf from satellite galaxies .",
    "the central galaxies dominate the lf on any luminosity scale , similar to the conclusion by @xcite that central galaxies dominate the stellar mass function on any mass scale .",
    "the fractional contribution of satellites to lf depends on the luminosity and has a maximum slightly below @xmath45 .",
    "we now explore the origin of the slope @xmath6 of the lf at the faint end , and then discuss the meaning of the characteristic scale @xmath0 above which lf decreases steeply with increasing luminosity .",
    "the faint - end slope of the lf is related to the low - mass slopes of the halo mass function and the @xmath2@xmath3 relation . at low halo masses , the mass function @xmath46 , where @xmath47 in the press - schechter mass function and @xmath48 in the st mass function . here",
    ", @xmath49 is the density variance on scales @xmath3 , while @xmath50 is the slope of the matter power spectrum , @xmath51 .",
    "since central galaxies dominate the lf , we have @xmath52 . if @xmath53 , we can write @xmath54 , where we have ignored the scatter in the @xmath2@xmath3 relation by setting @xmath55 and thus replacing the log - normal distribution representing the dispersion of central galaxy luminosities with a @xmath56-function at @xmath2 ; the faint - end slope of the lf is insensitive to @xmath30 . the faint - end lf then scales as @xmath57 .",
    "an examination of figure [ fig : sloan]b shows that the faint - end slope of the lf is defined by galaxies in dark matter halos with masses below @xmath58 . at these mass scales , @xmath59 , where the upper limit corresponds to asymptotically low mass halos . since @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 , and thus @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "we expect @xmath64 , unless the @xmath2@xmath3 relation is steeper than @xmath65 at the low - mass end .",
    "we expect that the slope of @xmath66 at the faint end is independent of the color selection and bandpass , as these choices only affect the normalization of the mass - to - light scaling . in the case of the @xmath41-band galaxy lf ,",
    "the measured faint - end slopes range from @xmath67 @xcite to @xmath68 @xcite . at other wavelengths",
    ", the best - measured galaxy lf has @xmath69 in the @xmath40 band of 2df @xcite and the flatter @xmath70 in the @xmath71-band of sdss @xcite . when the same luminosity function was extended to fainter magnitudes , however , @xmath72 @xcite , consistent with our expectations .",
    "provided that the @xmath2@xmath3 relation is well known on all scales , the lf of galaxies subject to a particular selection criterion based on galaxy type or environment ( e.g. , field galaxies , cluster galaxies , etc . ) can be estimated directly by inserting the probability of selection in the integral in equation ( [ eq : lf ] ) .",
    "variation between selection criteria may be responsible for the observed variation in @xmath6 .",
    "selection criteria also seem to be responsible for the measurements with @xmath73 , which naively seem discrepant with the above predictions . if , e.g. , a survey is biased toward ignoring the galaxies in low mass halos , one may indeed measure @xmath74 .",
    "it is unclear whether the faint - end slope of the lf changes with redshift .",
    "@xcite , who studied the redshift evolution of the lf in the @xmath41-band , assumed a priori that @xmath6 is independent of redshift .",
    "since the slope of the mass function at low masses is independent of redshift , any variation of @xmath6 with redshift would imply that the @xmath2@xmath3 relation must also vary with redshift .",
    "the expected correlation between @xmath6 and the slope of the @xmath2@xmath3 relation can be tested directly if a galaxy survey , e.g. , at @xmath75 , can be combined with weak lensing mass estimates for galaxies in the same sample .",
    "when an unbiased galaxy sample is used , @xmath0 can be identified with the scale above which the luminosity scatter in the @xmath2@xmath3 relation dominates over the increase of luminosity with mass , i.e. , @xmath76 . with @xmath77 ,",
    "this yields @xmath78 and @xmath79 . above this value ,",
    "the further increase in mean galaxy luminosity with halo mass is smaller than the scatter , and the corresponding clfs overlap .",
    "had the @xmath2@xmath3 relation continued to increase at the rate @xmath80 , the clfs would have been disjoint and the schechter function would not have exhibited the usual exponential cut - off .",
    "satellite galaxies do not contribute significantly to the overall lf .",
    "nevertheless , galaxy cluster studies routinely measure the lf of satellite galaxies in clusters . in figure",
    "[ fig : lum]a , we plot the lf of satellite galaxies in clusters from @xcite . since the measurement is in the @xmath41-band and is based on the same data is in figure [ fig : sloan]a , a direct comparison with our model is possible . in figure",
    "[ fig : lum]a , we plot the lf with and without central galaxies , and also the lf of central galaxies alone . in this calculation",
    "we assumed that the cluster mass lies in the range @xmath81 with a dispersion of @xmath82 .",
    "our construction reproduces the observational fact @xcite that the cluster lf , inclusive the central galaxies , departs significantly from the schechter form .",
    "similarly , @xcite decomposed the total lf of nearby clusters and groups into a log - normal and a schechter function - like component .",
    "the @xcite data suggest that the power - law slope of the satellite distribution is @xmath83 , while the maximum luminosity @xmath84 of the satellite distribution is in the range @xmath85 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lum]b , we compare the field galaxy lf of @xcite with the predictions of our model .",
    "the definition of _ field _ galaxies here includes all galaxies regardless of the environment .",
    "nevertheless , their selection of galaxies may still somehow have been biased or affected by the cosmic variance ( the random fluctuation in the number of groups and clusters in a survey of limited volume ) .",
    "the @xcite data are best described with a maximum mass of @xmath86 .",
    "this corresponding @xmath0 is factor of 2 below the value expected based on the construction described in ",
    "[ sec : correlation ] . the discrepancy could perhaps be ascribed to the cosmic variance in the number of clusters in the sample of @xcite .",
    "we vary the width @xmath30 of the gaussian that describes the dispersion in luminosity at fixed halo mass . to match the exponential behavior of the lf , @xmath87 is appropriate , which is perfectly consistent with the factor of @xmath88 vertical scatter in the @xmath2@xmath3 relation .",
    "this scatter is somewhat higher than @xmath89 estimated by @xcite for the bright - end of the tf relation ( mass scales of @xmath90 ) ; their estimate of the scatter was based on the data of @xcite .    as an example of a practical application of our reconstructed clf , in figure [ fig : bias ]",
    "we compare our prediction of the luminosity - dependent galaxy bias with the measurements from sdss @xcite and 2df @xcite .",
    "the bias equals @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the halo bias based on the st mass function @xcite .",
    "the bias increases monotonically from below unity to above unity as @xmath93 ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "this behavior is reproduced in our model which shows that the average bias is also dominated by central galaxies at a given luminosity .",
    "semi - analytic studies have , thus far , not succeeded in reproducing the observed lf @xcite . here , we have presented a simple model that exposes the basic elements that shape the lf .",
    "the faint - end slope of the lf has received attention recently because it differs from the slope of the halo mass function @xcite .",
    "if the scaling of the average galaxy luminosity with the halo mass at luminosities below @xmath0 can be explained , lf can be directly recovered as we demonstrate in   [ sec : correlation ] .",
    "the shape of the lf at @xmath96 is then governed by the dissipationless merging model for luminosity growth presented in @xcite .",
    "there , we argued that feedback processes must prevent continued star formation on all luminosity scales @xmath97 .",
    "we also note that our construction may also make it easier to reliably measure cosmological parameters from the galaxy lf , as first attempted in @xcite .",
