    "in addition to ferromagnetism , ( possibly ) spin - triplet superconductivity was recently discovered in the metallic ferromagnets uge@xmath2 ,  @xcite urhge ,  @xcite and zrzn@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite consequently , the relation between superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been of special interest in the field of strongly correlated systems . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the occurrence of superconductivity in ferromagnetic materials is naturally explained by the formation of cooper pairs with parallel spins , namely , spin - triplet pairs .",
    "@xcite    among the origins of ferromagnetism mentioned above , only the three - site ring exchange interaction acts on a couple of electrons .",
    "it yields a ferromagnetic spin correlation , which in turn produces an attractive effect between them .",
    "one may easily imagine that a spin - triplet superconductivity is realized if the attractive interaction between electrons can survive against the other effects .",
    "recently , we have confirmed that this mechanism actually works in a fairly simple correlated electron system ; the system consists of two hubbard chains coupled with zigzag bonds and has a unique structure of hopping integrals .",
    "@xcite in this model , the spin - triplet pairing of electrons occurs between the inter - chain neighboring sites .",
    "if the ferromagnetic correlation between the two chains are essential for the spin - triplet superconductivity , we may be allowed to mimic our original model by a double - chain hubbard model coupled with ferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "this new model is much easier to analyze than the original one due to the reduction of quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the introduction of this model will enable us to investigate the spin - triplet superconductivity in more detail for wide range of parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we thus study the double - chain hubbard model coupled with ferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "we use the weak - coupling bosonization / renormalization group ( rg ) analyses ,  @xcite the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique , and the lanczos exact - diagonalization method .",
    "@xcite we thereby determine the ground - state phase diagram : we find that , in the high electron density regions , the spin gap opens and the @xmath3-wave - like pairing occurs , while in the low electron density regions , the system is in the metallic state with full spin polarization , where the @xmath4-wave - like spin - triplet pairing correlation becomes the most dominant .",
    "we note that this model can be regarded as a single - chain model with two degenerate orbitals if we assume the ferromagnetic exchange interaction to be identified with the intra - atomic hund s rule coupling .",
    "this single - chain model has so far been studied both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the haldane gap state is realized at half filling .",

    "[ fig : corre1](b ) ] , the system has a @xmath149 ground state but is somewhat closer to the fully - polarized ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the s2 pairing correlation is still the most dominant one but the t1 pairing correlation becomes much enhanced at a short distance @xmath253 .",
    "this is because the formation of a local spin - triplet bound state on a rung can gain some energies .",
    "we note that the t2 pairing correlation is also enhanced , reflecting a tendency to the fully - polarized ferromagnetic state .",
    "the decay ratio of the s2 correlation is @xmath254 , which leads to @xmath255 .",
    "this value agrees well with our direct estimation of @xmath256 ( see sec.[tl ] ) . if the system further approaches the fully - polarized ferromagnetic phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : corre1](c ) ] , the change in the correlation functions at short ranges becomes more prominent .",

    "therefore , we can see how the nodes appear in the superconducting gap function .",
    "the anomalous green function is defined by @xmath266 where @xmath267 denote the wavefunction of the ground state with @xmath268 up - spin and @xmath268 down - spin electrons , and @xmath269 is chosen as the average value of @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",

    "we should note that the bcs theory is not readily applicable for ( quasi ) one - dimensional system ; actually , @xmath275 is not long - range ordered with a logarithmic decay as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "however , apart from this prefactor , we can naively expect that @xmath275 calculated on finite - size systems should provide information on the pairing symmetry at intermediate distances .",

    "we also find that the spectral weight vanishes at @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 .",
    "the weights of the peaks appear to be similar to the bcs form of the condensation amplitude , which has a maximum value at the fermi momenta .",
    "we may thus assume that the superconducting ground state in strongly correlated electron systems can be characterized by a gap function , which is directly proportional to the frequency - integrated function @xmath275 .",

    "@xmath256 increases monotonously with increasing @xmath157 , which is consistent with the monotonous increase in the binding energy with respect to @xmath157 in the strong - coupling regime . for @xmath158 ,",
    "the behaviors for @xmath295 and @xmath296 are quite similar to those for @xmath232 , although the values are somewhat smaller due to the effects of the umklapp scattering .",
    "however , we estimate the tl parameter as @xmath258 for @xmath297 . this regime corresponds to the fully - polarized ferromagnetic phase and",
    "the tl parameter should be the same as that of a spinless fermion system .",

    "the system is characterized as the s2-type spin - singlet superconducting state , and at lower concentrations from the phase boundary , the system is characterized as the fully - polarized ferromagnetic state and simultaneously as the t1-type spin - triplet superconducting state .",
    "we note that the fully - polarized ferromagnetic phase is spread to the higher concentration range with increasing @xmath17 , and it occupies the entire parameter region ( @xmath302 ) at @xmath203 .",
    "this result is connected to the nagaoka state@xcite at @xmath303 .",
    "we have studied the ground - state properties of the double - chain hubbard model coupled with ferromagnetic exchange interaction by using the weak - coupling theory , dmrg technique , and the lanczos method .",
    "we have thereby determined the ground - state phase diagram in the parameter space of the ferromagnetic exchange interaction and band filling .",
    "we have found that , in high electron density regime , the spin gap opens and the spin - singlet @xmath0-wave - like pairing correlation is most dominant , and in low electron density regime , the fully - polarized ferromagnetic state is stabilized and simultaneously the spin - triplet @xmath1-wave - like pairing correlation becomes most dominant .    here",
    ", let us make some comment on what happens if some additional terms are introduced to our model .",
    "first , we consider the case where the hopping integral between the two chains @xmath304 is added . in this case , the couplings @xmath88 and @xmath89 become irrelevant , which leads to a collapse of the pairing state between different bands , i.e. , @xmath259 and @xmath305 .",
    "thus , the spin - singlet superconductivity is suppressed . since the term @xmath304 induces the antiferromagnetic interaction on each rung , the spin - triplet superconductivity",
    "may also be suppressed .",
    "next , we consider the case where the intersite coulomb interaction between the two chains @xmath306 is added . in this case",
    ", we can easily imagine that the spin - triplet superconductivity is strongly suppressed because the @xmath307-wave - like pairing state is formed on rung .",
    "the double exchange interaction for the @xmath0-wave - like pairing state is also suppressed .",
    "finally , let us discuss possible relationship between the present model and the model of two hubbard chains coupled with zigzag bonds where the spin - triplet superconductivity has been shown to occur.@xcite the two models in the strong - coupling regime have the following features in common : ( i ) the superconductivity occurs near the region of ferromagnetism , ( ii ) there is a competition between the spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairings , and ( iii ) the spin - gap is quite small or vanishes .",
    "these situations may well suggest that the spin - triplet pairing could be dominant in the present model near the phase boundary between the spin - singlet superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "so far , we have not found any indications that the spin - triplet pairing becomes more dominant than the spin - singlet pairing unless the ground state is spin polarized .",
    "we hope that this point will be clarified with more elaborate calculations done in future .",
