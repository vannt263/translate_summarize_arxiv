    "the homogeneous ( i.e. , equispaced ) , linear , and periodic chain of hydrogen atoms ( hereafter , the h - chain ) is commonly believed to be the simplest physical system described by the one - band , periodic , one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard hamiltonian @xcite ( see eq .",
    "[ hubbard : eqn ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is exactly solvable @xcite and its solution predicts the h - chain to be always a mott - hubbard ( i.e. , a strongly correlated ) insulator .",
    "indeed , it seems reasonable to model the h - chain by including only the @xmath0 orbitals and by neglecting the long - range tail of the coulomb interaction , especially for large interatomic distances . as a consequence",
    ", the h - chain has been intensively studied to benchmark _ ab initio _ approaches to strong electronic correlation @xcite despite this atomic chain is not directly observable due to the well known peierls instability .",
    "previous _ ab initio _ studies  mostly using methods of quantum chemistry  have been focused on finite ( i.e. , not periodic ) linear chains , only .",
    "however , periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) analogous to the born - von krmn boundary conditions used in solid state physics are better suited to investigate phase transitions or crossovers . indeed ,",
    "unwanted edge effects are avoided by using pbc and a speed up of the convergence to the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , the limit of infinite linear chains , is expected .",
    "@xcite hence , an _ ab initio _ description of the low energy physics of a properly periodic h - chain is still missing . in this article",
    "we provide the first exhaustive , fully _ _ ab initio",
    "_ _ variational description of periodic chains by using the same kind of variational wave function for both the weakly and the strongly correlated regimes , i.e. , for both small and large interatomic distances .    from previous studies",
    ", it is known that in the strongly correlated regime  i.e . , for interatomic distances , @xmath1 , larger than a certain critical distance , @xmath2the ground state of the finite h - chains is characterized by a huge degeneracy of the natural orbitals @xcite which leads to an almost uniform natural orbital population , narrowly dispersed around @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite this behavior has to be contrasted with the weakly correlated regime ( @xmath4 ) for which already the restricted hartree - fock reference  that yields either doubly occupied of empty natural orbital  is quite accurate .",
    "@xcite    in many cases , @xcite part of the static correlation which characterizes the strongly correlated regime can be effectively recovered by means of an unrestricted hartree - fock calculation , or equivalently , by means of a spin - polarized density functional theory calculation within the local density approximation .",
    "@xcite although justified for finite systems , a spin - polarized approach implies a mean - field antiferromagnetic order , which can not be trusted in the thermodynamic limit , because true antiferromagnetism is not possible for 1d solids .",
    "@xcite    the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) provides an , in principle exact , algorithm to compute the electronic structure of 1d and almost-1d systems , although in practice limited by the size of the orbital basis set .",
    "@xcite it works very efficiently also when other highly correlated methods fail , e.g. , configuration interaction @xcite is not applicable if the system size is too large and the standard coupled cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples becomes unstable in 1d for large interatomic distances .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , even the very favorable numerical efficiency of dmrg is lost for a gapless ( i.e. , metallic ) chain . in this case , also the moller - plesset perturbative approach is not straightforwardly applicable due to the numerical issues triggered by the vanishing small gap .",
    "among the possible alternatives to standard quantum chemical approaches , @xcite one can consider non - perturbative quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods like vmc or the , in principle more accurate , diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) .",
    "@xcite in fact , a direct application of dmc to a homogeneous chain raises some ergodicity issues when the electrons are very localized about the nuclei , i.e. , in the strongly correlated regime .",
    "@xcite as a consequence ,",
    "to date only alternating ( i.e. , dimerized ) chains have been investigated by means of dmc @xcite on the other hand , vmc can be made ergodic by tailoring the sampling and by improving the variational many - body wave function , so that it remains very effective also close to crossovers and phase transitions .",
    "@xcite    there have been dramatic theoretical advances in the quality of the variational wave function during the last decade , so that it is now possible to achieve chemical accuracy for atoms , ions , small molecules and even periodic systems .",
    "@xcite these quantitative improvements have been made possible by new stochastic optimization techniques which can optimize variational wave functions depending on hundreds free parameters .",
    "@xcite    in our variational calculations , we have used a jastrow - antisymmetrized geminal power ( jagp ) variational wave function for @xmath5 ( even ) interacting electrons , @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8-dimensional coordinate vector , @xmath9 is the antisymmetrization operator , @xmath10 is a symmetric function describing a singlet electron pair and @xmath11\\;,\\ ] ] is the jastrow factor .    by using eq .",
    "[ jagp ] , one can accurately describe both static and dynamics correlations .",
    "indeed , the antisymmetrized geminal power , @xmath12 provides a very compact multideterminant reference , while the jastrow factor takes into account the dynamic correlation from : i ) a short - range homogeneous electron - electron interaction through the term @xmath13 which just depends on the distance , @xmath14 , between paired electrons ; @xcite ii ) the inhomogeneous electron - electron - nucleus and electron - electron - nucleus - nucleus interactions through the term @xmath15 , which depends separately on the coordinates of the paired electrons , and it can also describe long - range electronic correlations .",
    "results showed in this article have been obtained using a short - range homogeneous jastrow factor , @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , to asses the sensitivity of these results on the detail of the wave function , we have also considered a long - range homogeneous jastrow factor , @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_z_a5.0_convergence : fig ] ) . in both cases",
    ", @xmath18 is a variational parameter , and the electronic cusp conditions @xcite are automatically satisfied .",
    "the functions @xmath10 in eq .",
    "[ jagp ] and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "[ jastrow ] are expanded using ( in principle different ) nonorthogonal atomic orbitals , @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that @xmath22 in particular , up to @xmath23 orbitals for the geminal part and @xmath24 for the jastrow part have been considered in this work .    in principle , all the entries of the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq .",
    "[ jastroweq ] are variational parameters to be optimized .",
    "however , by taking advantage of the symmetries of the periodic linear chain , @xcite and by using an alternative , minimal expansion in terms of molecular orbitals , @xcite the actual number of independent variational parameters to optimize is reduced , so that the optimization can be effectively performed by the method describes in ref .  .",
    "all the vmc calculations have been performed by using the _ turborvb _ package,@xcite starting from a density functional theory ( in local density approximation ) calculation employing the orbital basis set , @xmath20 , of the geminal part ( see eq .  [ jastroweq ] ) .",
    "this preliminary step is done to speed up the convergence of the following vmc optimization , while avoiding an uncontrolled bias .",
    "finally , we have used a supercell with pbc @xcite in all three cartesian directions to model the periodic linear chain . to avoid unphysical self - interaction of the chain with its periodic replicas ,",
    "the transverse dimensions of the supercell have been taken as @xmath27 a.u . , where @xmath1 is the interatomic distance .",
    "according to the supercell formalism , the thermodynamic limit , @xmath28 , can be achieved by increasing the number , @xmath5 , of h atoms in the supercell . in particular , where not otherwise indicated , by h@xmath29 we mean a periodic chain with @xmath5 atoms in the supercell .    to identify the weakly and the strongly correlated regimes , we have used the so - called `` modern theory of polarization '' .",
    "@xcite this theory also provides a way to discriminate between a metal and an insulator alternative to the knowledge of the ( many - body ) charge gap , which in fact is not accessible by a variational ground state calculation .    in practice , by vmc one computes the expectation values of the complex polarization , @xmath30 , @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the component of @xmath33 parallel to the chain axis .",
    "then the electronic localization length , @xmath34 , is obtained as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the longitudinal dimension of the supercell and @xmath5 the number of h atoms in the supercell .    from previous studies ,",
    "@xcite one expects a huge degeneracy of the natural orbitals when the electrons are very localized about the nuclei , i.e. , when @xmath37 .",
    "besides , the theory says that , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath28 , a metal is characterized by a vanishing modulus of the complex polarization , @xmath38 , while in the insulating case @xmath39 .",
    ", @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 h atoms in the supercell .",
    "[ data are almost superimposed at the scale of this figure , see also tab .",

    "h@xmath43 chain obtained by vmc and dmrg @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_etot : fig](a ) , we show the convergence of the total energy per atom by increasing the number of h atoms per supercell for several interatomic distances .",
    "we note that the h@xmath43 periodic h - chain is already well converged at the scale of this figure . to follow the fine detail of the convergence ,",
    "the values of the total energy per atom details have been also listed in tab .",

    "the vmc error on the last digit is indicated in parenthesis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our findings are in agreement with previous variational studies of lattice models with short - range interactions which showed that a correct description of the mott - hubbard insulating phase can be achieved only by combining a gutzwiller projector and a long - range jastrow factor .",
    "@xcite    in fact , although the single h atoms are on average neutral , charge fluctuations which give , e.g. , virtual h@xmath44-h@xmath45 pairs , are always possible .",
    "such charge fluctuations are in fact strongly suppressed at large interatomic distance , @xmath1 ( and , in the hubbard model , for large @xmath46 ) .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath1 , in order to prevent an instability of the mott - hubbard insulator toward a metallic state driven by the quantum fluctuations , @xcite the h@xmath44-h@xmath45 pairs must be bound . in the context of the hubbard model ,",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated that such binding mechanism can be included in the variational wave function by means of an inhomogeneous jastrow factor , analogous to the the second term in eq .",
    "[ jastrow ] .",
    "crucially , the matrix element @xmath26 in the expansion of the inhomogeneous jastrow factor ( see .",
    "eq .  [ jastroweq ] ) can be nonvanishing also for pairs of orbitals ( labeled by the greek indices ) which are far apart .",
    "indeed , such long range correlation is necessary to bind the virtual h@xmath44-h@xmath45 pairs and , along with the homogeneous jastrow factor , provides an accurate way to model electron localization in the mott - hubbard insulating phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_z_a5.0_convergence : fig](a ) .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the ground state of a homogeneous , linear , and periodic chain of hydrogen atoms ( or h - chain ) from first principles , by means of a state - of - the - art variational monte carlo approach .",
    "in fact , using a highly correlated jastrow - antisymmetrized geminal power variational wave function allowed us to obtain a total energy per atom comparable to benchmark density matrix renormalization group calculations .",
    "@xcite furthermore , by using the so - called `` modern theory of polarization '' , @xcite we have characterized the crossover between the weakly correlated ( for small interatomic distances ) and the strongly correlated regimes ( for large interatomic distances ) through a single , simple parameter , i.e. , the electronic localization length .",
    "our results extend to the properly periodic h - chain previous results obtained by studying long , yet finite , chains .",
    "@xcite in particular , we confirmed that the crossover between the weakly and strongly correlated regimes of the h - chain corresponds physically to a crossover between a ( finite - size ) metallic and an insulating phase .",
    "finally , by studying the asymptotic behavior of the spin - spin and dimer - dimer correlation functions , we have also verified that the insulating phase of the real h - chain is of the mott - hubbard type , as expected from the hubbard model .",
    "@xcite since the correct description of such a correlated insulator is beyond the possibility of density functional theory in any of its conventional local or semi - local approximations , one can think of using our findings to devise an improved class of functionals .",
    "we are currently exploring this possibility .",
    "intriguingly , we have found small but noticeable deviations from the behavior predicted by the hubbard model in the case of the scaling exponent of the dimer - dimer correlation function predicted by the hubbard model .",
    "@xcite these deviations can be possibly due to the finite - size scaling or to a true discrepancy between the h - chain and the 1d hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit",
    ".    it will be interesting to check for possible new low energy physics of the h - chain at variance of the one - band , 1d hubbard model predictions .",
    "these might be originated by : i ) the long - range coulomb repulsion  indeed inefficiently screened in 1d systems  not included in the hubbard model ; ii ) the atomic orbital polarization ",
    "essential to describe non - covalent contribution to the bonding  not representable in terms of @xmath0 orbitals , only .",
    "in particular , relative simple elaborations of the hubbard model , which just contain next - nearest neighbor interaction , already predict a rich phase diagram even for a 1d system .",
    "@xcite besides , it is known that long - range coulomb repulsion can yield gapless charge excitations ( plasmons ) in 1d , as observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite    of course , more accurate finite - size extrapolation is desirable , although not possible with our current computational resources . in particular",
    ", the use of diffusion monte carlo to improve the variational results might be also beneficial , but in practice still highly problematic due to the well known ergodicity issues in dealing with strong electronic localization in 1d systems .",
    "@xcite    in conclusion , given that the homogeneous , linear and periodic chain of hydrogen atoms is becoming a standard test - case for _ ab initio _ approaches to strong electronic correlation , @xcite the results reported in this article show that variational monte carlo ( with a highly correlated jastrow - antisymmetrized geminal power variational wave function ) can provide an accurate and flexible alternative to highly correlated methods of quantum chemistry .",
    "besides , and at variance with most of the methods of quantum chemistry , variational monte carlo can be successfully employed to study a strongly correlated solid in low dimensions close to a crossover or a phase transition .",
