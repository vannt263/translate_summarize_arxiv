    "it has been known for a long time that objects in the membrane , which modify its local mechanical properties , can experience fluctuation - induced forces between them @xcite . in these thermal systems",
    "the interactions are energetically of the order of the temperature @xmath0 . however , in certain circumstances , in particular for tensionless membranes , the interactions can be long - ranged and thus can potentially have an important effect on the organization of the membrane .",
    "the hamiltonian for a tensionless membrane was introduced by helfrich @xcite . in the monge gauge , appropriate for small fluctuations ,",

    "the coordinates @xmath5 are the coordinates of the plane representing the projected area of the membrane . in single component membranes , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constant , the term in the hamiltonian proportional to @xmath7 is zero when the membrane is a free - floating sheet . in the fourier space representation",
    "the height - height correlation function in a sheet - like membrane is given by @xmath8 this means that the bending rigidity can be determined from fluctuation - mode analysis of tensionless membranes @xcite ( or in practice membranes with very low tension ) .",
    "the bending rigidity can also be estimated via mechanical measurements , such as by pulling cylindrical tethers from spherical vesicles @xcite .",
    "experimental results show that membrane bending rigidities typically lie between @xmath9 @xcite . experimentally estimating the gaussian rigidity is not easy ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , the pure bending energy of a perfectly spherical vesicle , where no fluctuations in the radius occur , can be shown to be given by @xcite @xmath10 the thermodynamic stability of flat membranes obviously requires that @xmath11 , to prevent the onset of large unstable fluctuations in one direction while the other remains flat . at the same time stability against formation of vesicles from a flat membrane and against the growth of saddles of mean",
    "zero curvature means that @xmath12 in reference @xcite both numerical simulation based and experimental measurements for @xmath13 are reviewed for both bilayer and monolayer systems .",
    "the results given for bilayer systems give @xmath14 $ ] . for monolayers",
    "the results are predominantly such that @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "it seems reasonable that as the bending rigidities @xmath6 and @xmath13 have their origins in the same physical properties of the lipids that they should be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the first study of fluctuation - induced interactions due to the spatial modulation of bending rigidities was by goulian , bruinsma and pincus @xcite who considered the interaction between inclusions , such as proteins , which modify the local rigidities ( but do not favor a local mean rigidity ) . in the case where the rigidity differences due to inclusions are small with respect to the background or mean rigidities ( @xmath15 ) , _ i.e. _ , if we write @xmath16 and assume that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are small , one can apply a pairwise approximation , which is exact to second - order in the deviation from the background rigidities , based on the cumulant expansion of the partition function .",
    "in @xcite it was found that the effective two - body interaction between regions deviating from the mean or background rigidities is given by @xmath19 for regions ( say discs ) whose centers of area are separated by a distance @xmath20 and are of area @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , we see that when @xmath20 is much larger than the size of the regions , the first - order term in a multipole expansion of the energy between the two regions is given by @xmath23 we first notice that this is a long - range interaction , and it is clearly a fluctuation - induced interaction which can be inferred from its proportionality to @xmath24 .",
    "secondly , we see that at the pairwise - order , we see that one must have both variations in @xmath3 and @xmath25 in order to have an interaction . in the case where both inclusions are of the same type , so that @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we see that if @xmath17 and @xmath28 have the same sign , then the interaction is repulsive , where as if they have opposite signs the interaction is attractive .",
    "this is an intriguing result . to to date ,",
    "other than via direct calculation , no one has proposed a physical explanation for the sign of the interaction .",
    "the same problem can also be analyzed for stiff inclusions and in general in the limit where the variations in the rigidity are not small @xcite .",
    "stiff inclusions can be modeled by imposing the condition that membrane be locally flat for a variety of objects , such as discs and rods .",
    "inclusions which modify the rigidity in a point - wise manner , _ via _ the delta - function - like changes to the rigidity , can be analyzed exactly and in principle for any number of objects .",
    "all of these studies consistently confirm the long - range interaction predicted in @xcite .",
    "more recently , methods developed for the study of the quantum electromagnetic casimir effect based on a scattering matrix approach have been employed to examine the interaction between two discs in a membrane @xcite . within this formalism",
    ", all n - body effects between the two discs can be taken into account ; in the tensionless limit , it is found that the interaction between two discs of radius @xmath29 behaves , for large separations @xmath20 between the disc centers , as @xmath30 where the coefficient @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the rigidities of the disc and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the background rigidities of the surrounding membrane .",
    "we see again that , in order to have an interaction , a variation in the gaussian curvature is necessary .",
    "however , at this higher order the interaction persists even if @xmath6 is constant .",
    "the computation of the fluctuation - mediated interaction in this simple two - body system is on the face of it rather complicated . practically , apart from two - body interactions",
    ", one would prefer to know how to describe , _",
    "e.g. _ , phase diagrams for many - particle systems , specified by macroscopic quantities , such as their average density , interacting via fluctuation - induced interactions .",
    "one example would be to examine a membrane containing a finite density of proteins that locally modify the bending rigidities .",
    "another would be a model where the membrane is composed of two lipid species that have different rigidities , which is the case we will study below .",
    "few studies exist on the thermodynamics of systems with many inclusions @xcite , though it has been shown in both monte carlo simulations and using various approximation schemes , such as mean - field theory coupled with monte carlo simulations and cumulant expansions , that fluctuation - induced interactions can have a significant influence on the organization of inclusions in lipid membranes .",
    "the studies described in @xcite are , however , quite different from that expounded here .",
    "first , we consider a free - floating tensionless membranes that are not subject to external potentials , such as a harmonic confining potential @xcite , or to an imposed external pressure @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the effect of variations in bending rigidity for membranes under tension was considered , but no variation in gaussian rigidity was included .",
    "secondly , the underlying formal analysis is also quite different from these previous studies .",
    "as mentioned above , the simple example we will consider here is that of lipid mixtures where the different lipid components have different rigidities . in principle",
    "this problem is complicated by the fact that each leaflet of the membrane can be composed of different lipid types . in this study",
    "we will assume that the lipids on both leaflets are the same .",
    "however , the method of analysis we propose here could be readily adapted to a model for a genuine two - leaflet system , notably because of its simplicity in application .",
    "the most easily applicable theory to analyze phase transitions is the mean - field theory .",
    "while it has several quantitative failings in critical systems , it is a useful tool to determine phase diagrams and is the first choice of analysis in most problems .",
    "it , however , appears futile to apply mean - field theory to fluctuation - induced interactions as in such systems there is no mean field ; for instance variations of the rigidities in the helfrich hamiltonian clearly do not break the up / down symmetry of the membrane . in what follows",
    "we will demonstrate that the helfrich theory can in fact be written in such a way as to allow the formulation of a mean - field theory that does capture fluctuation - induced interactions and , moreover , in such a way that the pairwise result of @xcite is perfectly taken into account .",
    "we will show how this mean - field theory modifies the standard regular solution mean - field theory  la flory describing demixing transitions .",
    "in addition , it is well known that casimir - like fluctuation - induced interactions often lead to divergent free energies that need to be regularized by introducing an ultra - violet or short distance cut - off .",
    "for example , in the electromagnetic casimir effect there are surface and bulk divergent terms in the energy , that nevertheless do not contribute to the casimir force if the bodies keep the same form and composition . in the theory",
    "we develop , we need to define a membrane patch size that is of the order of a lipid size and to specify the composition of the patch in terms of the lipid type occupying the patch . at the same time , this patch size corresponds to a lattice spacing for the helfrich elastic hamiltonian and thus plays the role of the natural cut - off for the membrane fluctuations . therefore , both the underlying lattice model for the lipid composition of the system and the lattice on which the membrane fluctuations take place",
    "are the same .",
    "this means that the cut - off will only set an overall energy scale and the phase diagram will thus be cut - off independent .    the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ pw ] )",
    "we discuss fluctuation - induced interactions in the pairwise approximation and also show that the problem of tensionless membranes with constant gaussian curvature can be solved exactly . then in section ( [ mf ] ) we discuss , not only how a mean - field theory for fluctuation - induced interactions can be formulated but also demonstrate the pitfalls associated with the most naive mean - field theory .",
    "we show how the correct pairwise interaction physics can be implemented at a mean - field level by changing the variables of the field theory and making it effectively non - local .",
    "this reformulation of the theory has two main advantages : it not only means that the mean - field theory captures the two body interactions correctly , but it also explains why differences in the gaussian rigidity are necessary to generate interactions .",
    "this latter point has been understood in slightly different contexts by a number of authors @xcite , but we revisit it here as it is of vital importance in constructing the theory and may also have experimental consequences . in section ( [ mfl ] )",
    "we show how the mean - field analysis of the membrane fluctuations can be coupled with the standard mean - field theory known as _ regular solution theory _ , in a simple lattice based model , to see how the mean - field phase diagram is modified by membrane fluctuations .",
    "in other words , we see how the phase diagram of a perfectly flat membrane , adhered to a flat surface or held under tension in a frame , is modified if it is allowed to fluctuate under zero tension .",
    "we discuss the predicted modification of the phase diagram and notably the effect of height fluctuations on mixing - demixing temperatures .",
    "the underlying mean - field theory",
    "is then resummed by formulating it variationally in section ( [ varimpro ] ) .",
    "though the basic results are unchanged at the two - body level , this resummation predicts subtle higher order differences from the basic mean - field theory , notably the presence of interactions in the case where the bending rigidity is constant .",
    "finally , we discuss possible experimental verification of our predictions and directions for further study .",
    "there are many examples of fluctuation - induced interactions .",
    "such interactions are generated between objects that interact with or modify the fluctuations of a quantum or thermal field @xcite .",
    "the most important and best known of these interactions are van der waals forces , which in the appropriate limit yield the celebrated casimir force @xcite . both dielectrics and conductors",
    "are coupled to the electromagnetic field ; however , they do not break the symmetry of the field as charges would .",
    "mathematically , and indeed physically , their effect can be taken into account via a quadratic coupling to the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , this quadratic coupling means that the naive mean - field of the theory , obtained from taking the saddle point of the hamiltonian , is zero .",
    "we begin by considering the case of a tensionless membrane but where the gaussian bending rigidity is constant and thus does not contribute to the elastic energy .",
    "we thus have @xmath35 ^ 2.\\ ] ] if we consider the case where the variations of @xmath6 with respect to the background value @xmath33 are small , we can compute the partition function due to elastic fluctuations using the cumulant expansion as in @xcite .",

    "we can demonstrate this lack of interaction at all orders by changing variables in the partition function .",
    "if we define a new variables @xmath40 ( minus the local average curvature ) the resulting helfrich partition function , up to a jacobian factor which is independent of the rigidity , becomes @xmath41\\exp\\left(-{\\beta\\over 2}\\int \\kappa({\\bf x})u^2({\\bf x } ) d{\\bf x}\\right),\\ ] ] now making another change of variable @xmath42 , we find that the contribution to the helfrich free energy from particle configurations is given by @xmath43 where we have evaluated the functional integral on a lattice of spacing @xmath29 and then taken the continuum limit .",
    "this result tallies with the contribution of electromagnetic field fluctuations to all orders in n - body interactions within a mean - field theory @xcite .    for a mixture of lipid types 1 and 2 with volume fractions @xmath44 and @xmath45 and bending rigidities @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively",
    ", we then find @xmath48\\label{kb0}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the number of independent membrane patches for a two - dimensional membrane of projected area @xmath31 .",
    "note that from this free energy we find that the internal energy of the system is given by @xmath50 that is to say the energy of @xmath51 membrane patches with an underlying quadratic hamiltonian as expected from the equipartition of energy .",
    "thus again we see that there is no interaction .",
    "this has been pointed in @xcite for the case of membranes and in @xcite for the case of semi - flexible polymers .",
    "the point here is that the physically relevant variable is the mean local curvature and that it is statistically independent point by point .",
    "there is , however , an additional subtle point , if the field @xmath52 has boundary conditions , then the change of variables made is not strictly valid",
    ". if we have free boundaries but with a line tension , the total length of the membranes perimeter will depend on the position of the particles , and thus the interaction induced by rigidity variations in the absence of surface tension will give a sub - extensive change in the free energy proportional to the perimeter of the membrane .",
    "we thus see that , in the absence of surface tension and variations in the gaussian rigidity , the membrane fluctuations do not induce interactions between regions of different bending rigidity .",
    "it is also interesting to note that one can compute the height - height correlation function for the membrane in this tensionless constant gaussian rigidity case . in terms of the variable @xmath53",
    "the height is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 the measure on the field @xmath53 is then simply given by @xmath56 = { \\exp\\left(-{1\\over 2}\\int w^2({\\bf x } ) d{\\bf x}\\right)\\over \\int d[w]\\exp\\left(-{1\\over 2}\\int w^2({\\bf x } ) d{\\bf x}\\right)}.\\ ] ] from this it is easy to see that @xmath57 consequently in a statistically translationally invariant system the spatially averaged correlation function is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 the effective bending rigidity is then given by the harmonic mean .",
    "we note that jensen s inequality implies that @xmath60 , thus the membrane is softened with respect to a pure one with @xmath61 , the arithmetic mean of the rigidities .",
    "equivalently for small @xmath62 in fourier space we rewrite the height correlator as @xmath63    the question of the effective bending rigidity for a model with constant @xmath13 at zero tension but in a quadratic confining potential was addressed by netz and pincus @xcite . in their cumulant expansion",
    "they perturbatively computed the effective bending rigidity for a quenched distribution of fluctuations of @xmath3 ; their perturbative result can be rewritten as the harmonic mean . the formula eq . ( [ kehm ] )",
    "has also been proposed in @xcite by invoking more phenomenological arguments .",
    "the agreement here is logical as the distribution of @xmath6 is effectively decoupled from the membrane fluctuations .",
    "the result that @xmath64 is the harmonic mean is a zero order result .",
    "when fluctuations in @xmath13 , a non - zero surface tension or quadratic coupling are included the value of @xmath64 will be suitably renormalized .",
    "we have seen that the helfrich hamiltonian @xmath65 depends on the local configuration of the membrane components via the functions @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "the total hamiltonian on a lattice will have two components , a direct interaction between the membrane components @xmath66 plus the membrane elasticity term .",
    "we thus write the total hamiltonian as @xmath67 the hamiltonian for @xmath66 is that of a lattice gas and depends on the occupation number of , say , membrane or lipid type @xmath62 at the site @xmath68 .",
    "we can , for instance , define the variable @xmath69 which is equal to @xmath70 at site @xmath68 if the lipid is of type 1 and @xmath71 if it is of type 2 .",
    "the lipids of different types will have rigidities denoted by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this model can , of course , be generalized to any number of lipid types .",
    "the simplest mean - field approximation one can make is to use a non - interacting lattice gas as the trial hamiltonian for the particles on the lattice .",

    "the mean - field partition function also bounds the exact partition function from below and thus the mean - field free energy gives an upper bound for the free energy",

    "it will have the form @xmath81 where @xmath51 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "for example , for a symmetric binary mixture undergoing a continuous demixing transition , regular solution theory has a free energy per lattice site given by @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are respectively the factions of lipids of type 1 and 2 , and @xmath83 is the flory parameter measured in units of @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath84 the interaction favors demixing of the system .",
    "the free energy @xmath80 thus describes the mean - field free energy of a confined system which is not allowed to fluctuate .",
    "this could be achieved for instance by applying a large lateral tension that generates an effective surface tension which suppresses all fluctuations .",
    "it now remains to compute the term @xmath85 .",
    "however , this mean - field approximation is only accurate to first order in the cumulant expansion , and we know that fluctuation - induced interactions only appear at second order .",
    "a mean - field approximation thus appears to be rather hopeless .",
    "furthermore , if we use this naive mean - field approximation , we find that the membrane contribution to the total free energy ( the membrane mean - field - mmf- free energy ) is , up to a constant independent of its composition , given by @xmath86\\exp\\left(-\\beta \\langle h_{hel}\\rangle_0",

    "the term proportional to @xmath13 gives zero upon averaging and thus the result is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "this is clearly an undesirable feature .",
    "our analysis in section ( [ pw ] ) shows that variations in @xmath13 are essential to induce fluctuation interactions .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to see that when @xmath13 is constant , the mean - field approximation predicts a spurious tendency of membrane fluctuations to favor demixing , while our exact result shows that , in this case , membrane fluctuations play no role in how the membrane is organized .",
    "naive mean - field theory applied to this problem is thus incapable of capturing fluctuation - induced interactions even at the pairwise level and in addition introduces an artifactual tendency toward demixing that we know is not present in the case where @xmath13 is constant .",
    "the solution to this problem is , as in section ( [ pw ] ) , to express the membrane partition function in terms of the variable @xmath89 .",
    "as we have seen already , this change of variables does not change the partition function as a function of its composition as long as the overall composition is fixed . with this change of variables the membrane partition function",

    "we have discussed how variations in the bending and gaussian rigidity of the components of simple model membranes induce effective fluctuation interactions due to their modification of height fluctuations .",
    "apart from these , there are always interactions between the lipids composing membranes due to steric and van der waals interactions .",
    "these interactions are present both when the membrane is flat , for instance if it is adhered to a flat surface , and when it is allowed to fluctuate . in this paper",
    "we have considered the additional interactions induced by the coupling of composition to height fluctuations via composition dependent rigidities . in the case of tensionless membranes ,",
    "we have exploited a simple transformation from the height variable to the reweighted mean curvature to demonstrate that variations in bending rigidity alone can not induce height fluctuation mediated interactions between membrane components .",
    "when variations in the gaussian rigidity @xmath13 are present , there are effective long range interactions , as first shown in @xcite at the pairwise level .",
    "a naive mean - field theory of this system thus fails to describe the proper physics and indeed predicts erroneous results for the case where we have exact results .",
    "this is to be expected as the basic formulation of mean - field theory only treats the first term in the cumulant expansion , whereas fluctuation - induced interactions only show up in the second order term of the cumulant expansion .",
    "however , by reformulating the theory in terms of the reweighted bending rigidity , the resulting theory contains all pairwise interactions in the first term of the cumulant expansion .",
    "the corresponding mean - field approximation thus captures the basic fluctuation - induced interactions for this system , at least at the pairwise level .",
    "the resulting mean - field theory is characterized by an effective flory parameter @xmath118 which depends on the bending rigidities of a two lipid system via eq .",
    "( [ echif ] ) .",
    "this result could in principle be used to estimate the difference in the gaussian rigidities via an analysis of tensionless , or near tensionless , membrane fluctuations for membranes composed of lipid mixtures , by fluctuation mode analysis for example .",
    "we emphasize that only relative differences can be measured , however this does present a step forward as previously only methods relying on topological changes in bilayer systems had been proposed to measure gaussian rigidities @xcite .",
    "the underlying model used is very idealized in the sense that the leaflets composing the bilayer are assumed to be symmetric , having the same composition on either side of the membrane - in this sense it is really a monolayer model",
    ". this condition can be relaxed by considering two coupled underlying lattices and taking the sum of the underlying bilayer bending energies .",
    "the effects of surface tension have also been ignored in this model . in practice ,",
    "even if the system is not under any external constraints one should introduce a surface tension to fix the average area occupied by the lipids .",
    "finally , we note that most theoretical studies associate a bending rigidity with a lipid species as we have done here .",
    "however when one considers lattice based models , it is clear that rigidity is associated with lattice links rather than sites and should thus depend on the lipid at a site and its neighbors .",
    "the mean - field approach proposed here could be applied to such models , potentially giving rise to a richer behavior as well as more detailed comparison with experiments and numerical simulations , notably for the behavior of the effective bending rigidity @xcite .",
    "the system studied here is rather special in that we have heavily exploited the exact solution for systems where @xmath95 is constant . for dielectric mixtures",
    ", one could presumably try to find a similar strategy where one reformulates the field theory in such a away that pairwise van der waals interactions are treated exactly at the first order of the cumulant expansion .",
    "the development of a successful mean - field theory as a first method of studying the thermodynamics of systems dominated by fluctuation - induced interactions could be very useful to predict phases exhibited by such systems and consequently could guide both experimental and numerical studies .",
