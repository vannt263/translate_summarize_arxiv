    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics describes the properties of elementary particles and their interactions , and has been in good agreement with numerous experiments , so far .",
    "moreover , one of its last building blocks , namely the higgs boson , has been detected and there are future planed experiments to precisely measure its couplings to matter as well as its self coupling .",
    "neutrino oscillation data established that at least two of the three sm neutrinos have mass and non - zero mixing . however , their properties , such as their nature , and the origin of the smallness of their mass , have no explanation within the sm , which cry out for new physics .",
    "one of the most popular mechanisms for understanding why neutrino mass is tiny is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite which assumes the existence of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with masses several order of magnitudes heavier than the electroweak ( ew ) scale . in this approach ,",
    "the dimension five operator @xmath2 will be induced in the low energy effective lagrangian , with @xmath3 is the scale of the new physics which is of the order of the rh neutrino mass scale .",
    "unfortunately , such heavy particles decouple from the low the energy spectrum at energies many orders of magnitudes higher than the ew scale and so can not be directly probed in high energy physics experiments . moreover , for rh neutrino heavier than @xmath4 , can destabilize the electroweak vacuum via the large loop corrections induced by the dirac neutrino yukawa term .    another possible way to explain",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses is by generating them at the loop level  @xcite . in this mechanism",
    "the tree level neutrino mass term vanishes due to some discrete symmetry and can be induced via loop diagrams with a loop suppression factors , and consequently , the scale of new physics @xmath3 can be much lower than the conventional see - saw mechanism .",
    "for instance , as it has been shown in  @xcite , the scale of new physics can be in the sub - tev for the 3-loops neutrino mass generation model  @xcite which makes it testable at collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "in most of the radiative neutrino mass models neutrinos are majorana particles and so one expects a violation of the total lepton number .",
    "this will have stringent phenomenological implications on loop - induced neutrino mass models and can be a direct indication of new physics . indeed , lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes are currently the object of a great attention , the experiences which aim at detecting them are becoming increasingly precise and clean .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath5 is simplest to detect , indeed , only one particle is created in the finale state , the electron .",
    "its energy is thus of the order of @xmath6 which is far from the principal background @xmath7 disintegration , whose energy spectrum decreases drastically beyond @xmath8 .",
    "the current experimental limits for these low - energy processes are @xmath9 ( meg  @xcite ) , @xmath10 ( sindrum  @xcite ) , @xmath11 ( babar  @xcite ) , @xmath12 ( belle  @xcite ) , @xmath13 ( babar  @xcite ) , @xmath14 ( belle  @xcite ) , and some of these bounds are expected to improve by almost an order of magnitude in the next couple of years .",
    "in particular , the meg experiment will be sensitive to @xmath5 branching ratio as low as @xmath15 which will be able to strongly constrain a large class of radiative neutrino mass models .",
    "in this work , we study the phenomenological implications of a class of radiative neutrino mass models based on the sm extension by rh neutrinos and a singlet charged scalar and in which the lightest rh neutrino is a dark matter candidate . after imposing the current bounds from the lfv processes on the model parameters ,",
    "we determine the parameter space for which the rh relic density is in agreement with the observation .",
    "we also consider the constraint on single and multi photon events with missing energy reported by l3 collaboration at lep  @xcite . in our scan",
    "we find that many of the points that satisfy the lfv constraints require a cancellation among the product combinations of the coupling to cancel out .",
    "for that we define a quantify that quantifies such a fine - tuning parameter and use it to classify the viable model parameter space .",
    "finally we study the possibility of observing a signal at future lepton colliders .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present a class of interactions involving right - handed neutrinos , that appear in many radiative neutrino mass models , and discuss the constraints from the different lfv processes . in section",
    "iii we show that the lightest rh neutrino can be a viable dark matter candidate while satisfying the current experimental bounds on lfv processes . in section",
    "iv we analysis the monophoton events with missing energy using the data collected by the l3 collaboration at lep - ii and determine the viable parameter space for such models . in section v , we consider three benchmark points ( according to the fine - tuning degree ) and study the possible signature of the rh neutrino and charged scalar signals at lepton colliders .",
    "we also discuss the effect of using polarized beams on the signal significance .",

    "<S> we examine lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions for heavy right - handed neutrinos that exist in most of the standard model ( sm ) extensions that address dark matter ( dm ) and neutrino mass at loop level . in order to probe the collider effect of these lfv interactions , </S>",
    "<S> we impose the assumption that the model parameters give the right values of the dm relic density and fulfill the constraints from the lfv processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
