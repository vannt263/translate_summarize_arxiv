    "it is well known that black hole accretion flows in a compact binary system typically consist of a keplerian disk which emits soft or low energy photons and a hot compton cloud which inverse comptonizes soft photons into high energy photons @xcite . when a black hole spectral state changes from hard to soft and vice versa , compton cloud must change its shape and temperature @xcite : in a soft state , when the accretion rate in the keplerian disk is high , compton cloud is smaller and cooler , while in a hard state , when keplerian disk rate is very low , compton cloud is larger and hotter .",
    "there are various models of the compton cloud in the literature , ranging from a hot corona , magnetic corona , to post - shock region of an accreting low angular momentum flow which surrounds the standard kelerian disk @xcite . along with spectral variabilities",
    ", a black hole candidate shows temporal variations also , which is sometimes quasi - periodic @xcite .",
    "there are various explanations of quasi - periodic oscillations in literature ranging from disc - seismology to oscillation of post - shock region @xcite .",
    "outburst sources are ideal candidates to study changes in the size of a compton cloud .",
    "this is because object is known to be in a hard state at the beginning of an outburst but in a matter of few days to a few weeks , it changes its states to several other states , thereby giving us a unique opportunity to study size variation of compton cloud very easily . from the spectral analysis , it appears that following sequence is typically followed by most , if not all , outburst sources : hard @xmath0 hard - intermediate @xmath0 soft - intermediate @xmath0 soft @xmath0 soft - intermediate @xmath0 hard - intermediate @xmath0 hard ) @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that average size of compton cloud in the variable source grs 1915 + 105 changes in a very well defined way as it transits from one variability class to another .",
    "they computed a quantity called comptonizing efficiency ( ce ) which is the ratio of number of power - law photons to the number of blackbody photons in the spectrum at a given instant .",
    "they show that ce is very small in softer classes and larger for harder classes . within some of classes ,",
    "there are evidences of rise and fall of count rates and spectral slopes in a matter of a few seconds .",
    "since number of hard photons depends on optical depth of compton cloud , we clearly see a change in optical depth of the compton cloud in that time scale . furthermore , we see that one variability class goes to another adjacent class whose ce is nearest .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study variation of compton cloud size during outbursts of several black hole candidates .",
    "we show that outbursts typically start with a large comptonization efficiency , i.e. , a large sized compton cloud with a poor soft photon source . in rising phase ,",
    "this cloud becomes progressively smaller and smaller on a daily basis , till it became minimum when the object went to a soft state .",
    "of course , soft photon source gets stronger ( soft photon intensity rises ) and as a result , the cloud size shrinks ( qpo frequency , assumed to be the oscillating frequency of the cloud , rises ) . in declining phase of an outburst , the trend is exactly reversed . in this paper , we deal with black hole candidates which exhibited outbursts , such as , h1743 - 322 , gx 339 - 4 , 4u 1543 - 47 , xte j1118 + 480 , xte j1859 + 226 , gro j1655 - 40 and xte j1550 - 564 . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the objects of our study . in  3 , we present the procedure of our analysis . here , we compute comptonization efficiency ( ce ) of all these outbursts both in rising and declining phases . we show that ce changes with time very rapidly . in general , softer states were found to have a very low ce and the harder states ( at the beginning of rising phase and at the end of declining phase ) were found to have a very high ce . in  4 , we present results and interpret them using physical models .",
    "finally , in  5 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider following outburst sources in the study .",

    "we adopted a technique introduced by @xcite , to obtain spectral parameters .",
    "we calculated error - bars at 90% confidence level in each case .",
    "@xcite reported that interstellar absorption mainly affects photons from @xmath38 to @xmath39 kev .",
    "it is important to consider this effect in rxte analysis since we need to count injected soft photons up to @xmath39 kev as accurately as possible .",
    "we chose @xmath40 as appropriate for each candidate to take care of this effect .",
    "in the literature , usual trend is to plot hardness ratio hr ( say , the ratio of 6 - 40 kev photons divided by 2 - 6 kev photons ) when it comes to understand how important compton scattering is .",
    "however , there are several problems in this definition : ( a ) hr does not depend on mass of the black hole , although hard ( comptonized ) and soft photons change their meaning with the mass of the black hole .",
    "for instance , soft photons in lower mass case could be comptonized photons in higher mass case .",
    "thus hr can not be compared for two objects , or even in two episodes of the same object . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we define a new parameter @xcite called comptonization efficiency ( ce ) which is defined purely on physical ground and independent of any model or mass of the black hole .",
    "since for stellar mass black holes we expect peak radiation from standard keplerian disk to be at around @xmath41 kev , and slope of power - law tail is defined for @xmath42 kev region , we choose a range @xmath43 kev to define ce , both ends being far from the expected values .",
    "we compute total number of soft ( seed ) photons ( @xmath44 ) from keplerian disk from multicolour black body and total number of power - law photons ( @xmath45 ) in ranges dynamically determined by best fits obtained after correcting observational data using energy dependent absorption due to hydrogen column .",
    "since these ranges are obtained dynamically , the ratio ce=@xmath45/@xmath44 is independent of mass of a black hole or any specific model of accretion flow .",
    "hence ce of two different objects can be compared , which we do in this paper .",
    "number of black body photons are obtained following @xcite . here",
    "we count the photons within the energy range starting from @xmath46 kev to the best fitted upper energy limit dbb@xmath47 by first fitting the spectrum with diskbb model alone @xcite .",
    "upper limit of black body energy dbb@xmath47 is obtained from the consideration that the reduced @xmath48 value from resultant fit should be @xmath49 .",
    "this upper limit may vary with time and from one data set to another .    comptonized photons @xmath45 are calculated by using the power - law equation given below , @xmath50 where , @xmath51 is the power - law index and @xmath52 is the total photons / s / kev at @xmath53 kev .",
    "it is reported in @xcite , that the comptonization spectrum will have a peak at around @xmath54 , where , @xmath55 is the temperature at the inner edge of the standard disk .",
    "thus , the power - law is integrated from @xmath54 to @xmath36 kev to calculate total rate of comptonized photons ( photons / s ) . @xmath55 and @xmath51 comes from spectral fit of each data . here",
    "we assume that the black hole is non - rotating .",
    "for rotating flows the corresponding spectral properties of the standard disk has to be used .",
    "[ symb ]    .observation ids analyzed in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we analyzed several black hole candidates which exhibit outbursts and shown the time dependence of comptonizing efficiency , qpos and the spectral index .",
    "we tried to understand the results using the tcaf model of @xcite and its time varying form , namely , propagatory oscillating shock ( pos ) model of the outbursts @xcite , though any model which relies on soft photons and inverse comptonization would be fine , since ce depends on the ratio of comptonized photons and soft seed photons . in tcaf model ,",
    "a standard keplerian disk is surrounded by a faster moving low - angular momentum flow ( sub - keplerian ) which produces a centrifugal pressure supported shock where the flow is puffed up and produces the so - called compton cloud to inverse comptonize intercepted soft photons coming from the keplerian disk .",
    "oscillation of post - shock region or cenbol causes low frequency qpos in black hole candidates .    in the backdrop of this model ,",
    "our goal is to study how the optical depth of the cenbol changes with time in a generic outburst source .",
    "if we had computed hardness ratio or hr , where the soft and hard photons are counted using the same fixed energy bins , a comparison of its behavior from one object to another would not be possible .",
    "this is because seed photons of one black hole could be comptonized photon for another . on the other hand , ce as defined by us characterizes soft and hard photons objectively and as such does not depend on mass of the black hole or its accretion rate .",
    "thus a comparison is possible .",
    "it is true that we restrict ourselves from 0.1 to 40 kev photons .",
    "however , for stellar mass black holes , these boundary values are far away from relevant energies in which respective photons are important .",
    "we came to a conclusion that generally speaking , all outbursts start and end with a large compton cloud size , though not necessarily with the highest optical depth . as the outburst progresses , ce becomes minimum at peak of an outburst i.e. , size of cenbol becomes very small .",
    "we find that ce in outburst sources may vary from almost @xmath56 to @xmath57% . in contrast , variable source grs 1915 + 105 has ce between @xmath58 to @xmath59 and has relatively high luminosity ( even after factoring out effects of mass of the black hole ) , suggesting that it is in a soft - intermediate state which usually appears after the peak of a possible outburst .",
    "if so , in future , this source may slow down its activities when the viscosity in this system is reduced as in any other outbursting source .",
    "we would like to stress that ce computed by us counts soft photons from @xmath46 kev to an upper energy limit automatically detected by our fitting method .",
    "if we concentrated on photons in the observed @xmath60 kev range and counted the number of soft photons , we would have obtained a different , in fact , much higher ce .",
    "this is because we would have grossly underestimated number of soft photons . in fig .",
    "[ figfrac ] , we show a comparison of ce computed by our method with ` fracsctr ' obtained from _ simpl _",
    "model @xcite for gx 339 - 4 data .",
    "_ simpl _ is an empirical model of comptonization which computes fraction of photons from an input seed spectrum which are scattered into a power - law component .",
    "fracsctr is fraction ( in the scale up to 1.0 ) of input seed photons is comptonized .",
    "black and gray points are for the 2007 and 2010 outburst data respectively .",
    "black stars and gray circles represent variations of fracsctr with ce when soft photons are taken from 0.1 - 40 kev ce(% ) range .",
    "one generally sees that one increases with the other . from fig .",
    "[ figfrac ] , we can see that fracsctr value varies around 0 to 0.8 this means 0 - 80 @xmath61 photons are interacting with hot electron cloud .",
    "but if we compare with ce then only 0.005 - 0.35 @xmath61 of photons are interacting with hot electron cloud which is more realistic .",
    "computed ce values do support relative shape of cenbol which is expected to intercept less than a few percent of soft photons from the keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "another important issue is to correlate spectral and timing data .",
    "we mentioned that ce is higher for harder states .",
    "this is because location and height of shock wave are large .",
    "we have also mentioned that low frequency qpos are due to oscillations of these shock waves and frequency is inverse of the infall time scale from post - shock region @xcite till the inner sonic point . as such , larger shock radius means smaller qpo frequency , which is exactly what we observe !",
    "if we combine these results , then tcaf model would predict that ce would be larger when the qpo frequency is smaller and vice versa . in fig .",
    "[ qce ] , we show measured qpo frequencies as a function of our ce for all the outbursts discussed in this paper .",
    "we find that ce is inversely correlated with qpo frequencies , although the relationship is not very tight in some cases . this could be because of presence of radio jets observed in all these outburst sources @xcite . while ce is influenced by electron clouds at base of a jet ( post - shock region in tcaf solution ) , qpo frequency",
    "is not directly affected by the jet , but only by location of oscillating shock .",
    "this could be a primary reason why some outbursters do not show a tight correlation .",
    "however , this aspect requires further investigation .",
    "it is also interesting to study variation of ce with luminosity in analogy with hardness ratio - intensity plots in the literature @xcite .",
    "since hardness ratio is obtained from a fixed range of x - ray photons , independent of mass of black hole , it is difficult to interpret what a conventional colour - colour diagram really means . in figs .",
    "[ qdia]a , and [ qdia]b , we plot ce vs. luminosity for both outbursts of xte 1550 - 564 and gx 339 - 4 respectively . in fig .  [",
    "qdia](a ) , dark filled boxes represent variation of ce(% ) with natural logarithm of luminosity in eddington unit during 1998 outburst and gray filled circles represent same for 2000 outburst . in fig .",
    "[ qdia](b ) , black filled boxes represent 2007 outburst of gx 339 - 4 , while gray filled circles represent the same for 2010 outburst of gx 339 - 4 . for all plots , arrows of corresponding colour are provided to understand evolution of data during outbursts .",
    "figures provide an idea about the relation between geometric size of the electron cloud and total luminosity during outburst . in case of xte 1550 - 564 ( fig .",
    "[ qdia]a ) , we observe that both outbursts started and ended with high ces , though final value of ce is lower than its initial value",
    ". however , this could be due to incompleteness of observation during onset of the outburst .",
    "outburst of 2000 is clearly weaker and short lived . in both the cases ,",
    "there is a hysteresis effect in that paths in rising and declining phases are not the same .",
    "this is expected , since formation time and disappearance time of a keplerian disk by viscous effects are not identical @xcite . in case of gx 339 - 4",
    ", both figures are generally overlapping and thus both were of roughly equal strength .",
    "we note that ce is not necessarily highest at beginning or end in all these cases , though it is close to highest values achieved during outburst",
    ". this may be because ce is sensitive to the optical depth and not just physical size of the cenbol .",
    "this is also the reason why qpo frequency variation ( sensitive to the size of cenbol ) is not tightly correlated with ce .",
    "an important result is that ce of gx 339 - 4 is much lower as compared to that of xte j1550 - 564 . since with spin the size of the cenbol shrinks at least by a factor of two @xcite , the degree of interception",
    "would also be reduced by the same factor .",
    "it is well known that spin of xte j1550 - 564 is moderate @xcite while the spin of gx 339 - 4 is very high @xcite .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing effects of large spin in gx 339 - 4 in our calculation also .     for ( a ) 1998(black ) and 2000(gray ) outburst of xte j1550 - 564 , ( b ) 2007(black ) and 2010(gray ) outburst of gx 339 - 4.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for ( a ) 1998(black ) and 2000(gray ) outburst of xte j1550 - 564 , ( b ) 2007(black ) and 2010(gray ) outburst of gx 339 - 4.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to show that soft photons beyond @xmath62 really do not contribute significantly , we recomputed the above values with soft photons till @xmath36 kev .",
    "we do not find any significant difference in the result .",
    "so we believe that our results with dynamically obtained black body photon energy range yields sufficiently accurate results .    from the table :  3 , we see that range of ce is different for different objects",
    ". duration of outbursts , qpo frequency range etc .",
    "are also found to be different .",
    "there is also a considerable scatter in ce which may be due to outflows from the cenbol .",
    "all these require a more thorough analysis for a unifying understanding of the outbursts .",
    "this will be addressed in our future publications . another way to improve",
    "the result is to use tcaf model itself to fit the spectra and obtain blackbody energy range more accurately .",
    "a third , and more serious point is to consider spin of black hole which will reduce ce by virtue of smaller cenbol size for higher spins .",
    "these aspects will be looked into in future .",

    "<S> temporal and spectral variations of black hole candidates during outbursts have been reported in several publications . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that during an outburst , source becomes softer in first few days , and then returns to hard states after a few weeks or months . in the present paper , we show variation of comptonization efficiency ( ce ) , defined to be the ratio of number of power - law photons and number of soft photons injected to into the compton cloud , as a function of time in several outbursts . since power - law photons are generated through inverse - comptonization of the intercepted soft photons , ce is a measure of geometry of compton cloud . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation indicates that all outbursts start with a large ce and becomes very small after a few days , when the compton cloud becomes small enough to intercept any significant number of soft photons . </S>",
    "<S> ce returns back to a larger value at the end of outburst . </S>",
    "<S> we show co - variation of count rates , frequency of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , photon index and ce and establish a general trend of disk geometry variation during outbursts in all systems under consideration .    </S>",
