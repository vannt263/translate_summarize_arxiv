    "the symmetric ground state is replaced , via the _ symmetry - breaking bifurcation _",
    "( sbb ; in fact , it is a variety of phase transitions ) , by an asymmetric state providing for a minimum of the system s energy , when the strength of the nonlinearity exceeds a critical value .",
    "this effect was originally discovered in a discrete model of self - trapping @xcite , and later studied in many settings @xcite .",
    "manifestations of the spontaneous symmetry breaking were also studied in detail in bec models @xcite and demonstrated experimentally in a self - repulsive bec @xcite .    in nonlinear optics , the sbb  was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite for continuous - wave ( spatially uniform ) states in the model of dual - core waveguides . for self - trapped modes in dual - core optical systems ,",
    "i.e. , solitons , the bifurcation was studied in refs .",
    "a specific example is the sbb for gap solitons in dual - core fiber bragg gratings @xcite .",
    "later , manifestations of the sbb  for matter - wave solitons held in _ dual - trough _ potential traps ( including solitons of the gap type , supported by a periodic optical - lattice potential ) were explored too @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the difference of the dual - trough configuration from the usual double well is the presence of an additional free direction , transverse to that in which the double - well potential acts , see fig .",
    "[ potenhshaped ] below .",
    "a characteristic property of solitons trapped in the symmetric dual - trough potential is that , under the action of the self - focusing cubic nonlinearity , they exhibit the sbb of the _ subcritical _ type . in that case ,",
    "branches of the asymmetric states emerge as unstable ones , going backward from the sbb  point and getting stable after switching their direction forward at turning points @xcite .",
    "thus , the system features the bistability before the bifurcation point , and this mode of the spontaneous symmetry change may be understood as the phase transition of the first kind . on the other hand ,",
    "the addition of a sufficiently strong periodic potential acting along the troughs changes the character of the sbb in the self - attractive medium from subcritical to _ supercritical_. in the latter case , the asymmetric branches emerge as stable ones , immediately going in the forward direction @xcite , which may also be realized as the phase transition of the second kind .",
    "the above - mentioned sbb for gap solitons in the dual - core fiber bragg grating is of the supercritical type too @xcite .",
    "another realization of effective double - well potentials is provided by settings based on double - peak spatial modulations of the local nonlinearity coefficient , which may be implemented in optics and bec alike , see recent review @xcite of the topic of solitons in nonlinear potentials .",
    "the simplest form of this setting has the nonlinearity concentrated at two points , in the form of a symmetric pair of delta - functions or narrow gaussians @xcite , as well as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) counterpart of the system , based on the set of two parallel stripes @xcite , or two circles @xcite carrying the self - attractive nonlinearity .",
    "the sbb of solitons in the double - well nonlinear potentials also features the symmetry breaking of the subcritical type @xcite .",
    "further , the spontaneous symmetry breaking was analyzed for 1d and 2d solitons in dual - core discrete systems , with the uniform coupling between two parallel chains @xcite , or with the coupling concentrated at a single site @xcite . in the former and latter cases ,",
    "the sbb is subcritical and supercritical , respectively .",
    "another implementation of the sbb in discrete settings was recently reported for a pair of nonlinear sites embedded into or side - coupled to a linear host lattice @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present work is to consider the sbb of self - attractive localized wave fields trapped in h - shaped potential landscapes , i.e. , two parallel troughs linked by a transverse rung , as shown in fig .",
    "potenhshaped below .",
    "this configuration can be implemented in effectively two - dimensional bec , using a set of attractive ( red - detuned ) laser sheets and/or blue - detuned repelling sheet pairs @xcite , or in bec  layers isolated by a strong standing optical wave @xcite , that can also be combined with magnetic trapping fields @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to use the techniques allowing one to  paint \" complex potential landscapes ( in fact , even more complex than the h - shaped ones that we aim to consider ) by rapidly moving laser beams @xcite , or induce time - averaged adiabatic landscapes created by means of variable magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "essentially the same effective potentials can be created in nonlinear optics , using properly patterned photonic - crystal media pcfcoupler , or a transverse trapping structure permanently written in bulk silica @xcite .",
    "we aim to consider both the full 2d model with the transverse h - shaped potential ( similar to the 2d model with the dual - trough potentials considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and its simplified 1d counterpart ( cf . the 1d version of the dual trough introduced in ref .",
    "arik ) .",
    "the transverse link ( rung ) added to the dual - trough potential can be used to control the dynamical properties of the system and , eventually , alter the character of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the system . in particular , the recent results reported for the discrete system @xcite suggest a possibility to change the type of the sbb  from sub- to supercritical ( i.e. , the kind of the respective phase transitions from first to second ) by gradually increasing the strength of the transverse link .    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the 2d and 1d models are introduced in section ii , and the full 2d system is considered in section iii by means of numerical methods .",
    "a set of bifurcation diagrams indeed demonstrates a switch from the sub- to supercritical sbb in the 2d setting .",
    "while one may expect that the strengthening of the linear coupling between the parallel troughs should lead to an increase of the critical value of the nonlinearity strength at which the sbb happens , we observe that , with the introduction of the transverse link , the critical nonlinearity strength at first decreases , due to the change of the character of the bifurcation , and only later starts to grow . in section iv",
    ", we deal with the 1d versions of the system . in that case",
    ", the transverse link reduces to a localized linear coupling between two one - dimensional gpes / nlses . in that context",
    ", we consider different longitudinal profiles of the coupling .",
    "first , approximating it by a @xmath0-function of the longitudinal coordinate , we report exact analytical solutions for the solitons of all the types  symmetric , antisymmetric , and asymmetric . accordingly",
    ", an exact comprehensive solution for the sbb is available .",
    "next , we consider the coupling localized in a finite interval , with the gaussian profile . in that case , we develop a variational approximation ( va ) , and verify its predictions by comparison to numerical findings .",
    "finally , we consider the 1d system which combines the linear and nonlinear localized couplings between the one - dimensional gpes / nlses , both with the gaussian profile .",
    "for that purpose , the va is developed too . in all the versions of the 1d system ,",
    "the sbb is always found to be of the supercritical type , unlike the full 2d model that reveals the transition to the supercritical type from the subcritical one .",

    "this conclusion is naturally explained by the above - mentioned fact that the full 2d model automatically takes into account both the linear and nonlinear coupling between the parallel troughs .",
    "the objective of this work is to extend the study of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1d and 2d solitons trapped in the systems of two parallel tunnel - coupled potential troughs . unlike recently studied models ,",
    "here we introduce the h - shaped potential , and focus on the sbb ( symmetry - breaking bifurcation ) for solitons in this system .",
    "the analysis of both the 2d and 1d versions of the model demonstrates that the transverse link ( the rung of the h - shaped potential profile ) transforms the bifurcation from subcritical into the supercritical one . in other words",
    ", the rung controls the switching of the corresponding symmetry - breaking phase transition from the first into second kind .",
    "a nontrivial manifestation of the change of the sbb type is the non - monotonous dependence of the critical value of the soliton s norm , at the bifurcation point , on the strength of the transverse link : prior to the expected growth , it demonstrates a region of the decrease . in the full 2d model",
    ", the results were obtained in the numerical form . on the other hand ,",
    "the 1d version with the @xmath0-functional profile of the local linear coupling between the troughs admits the exact analytical solutions for the solitons of all the types  symmetric , antisymmetric , and asymmetric  and , accordingly , the bifurcation diagram was obtained in the exact analytical form , which is a rare possibility . in other variant of the 1d model , with the gaussian profile of the local transverse linear coupling",
    ", the results were obtained by means of the va ( variational approximation ) .",
    "the va was also used to solve the bifurcation problem in the system combining the linear and nonlinear localized transverse coupling .",
    "the set of the results reported in the paper provides for a comprehensive description of the symmetry breaking in the h - shaped system .",
    "in particular , adding the nonlinear coupling to the 1d model makes the characteristics of the symmetry breaking closer to those found in the full 2d model , which automatically incorporates linear and nonlinear coupling effects .",
    "the settings considered in this work can be realized in the self - attractive bec , and in self - focusing bulk optical media , with the appropriate transverse profile of the refractive index .",
    "it is relevant to stress that the description of the bec based on the coupled gpes is entirely based on the mean - field approximation .",
    "while it is well known that this approximation provides for an exceptionally accurate description of virtually all matter - wave patterns observed in experiments , quantum fluctuations and other beyond - mean - field effects being detectable only under special conditions @xcite , one may expect that fluctuations can be amplified in a vicinity of the phase transition ( i.e. ,  of the sbb ) , which suggests a question , whether the gpes are applicable in this case .",
    "a full analysis of this issue should be a subject for a separate extended work ; nevertheless , a relevant analogy is suggested by the analysis of fluctuations in the vicinity of the sbb , both in the continuous - wave and soliton settings , which was performed in the framework of the model of the directional coupler in nonlinear optics , based on the coupled 1d nlses , in ref .",
    "the conclusion was that , on the contrary to the anticipations , the fluctuational effects remain virtually negligible in that case , their amplification in the vicinity of the respective sbbs producing no conspicuous changes against the mean - field description .",
    "based on this analogy , we expect that the mean - field description remains valid in the present case too .",
    "one possibility for further development of the analysis is to perform it in a two - component system .",
    "another interesting extension may be carried out for a configuration with _ two _ parallel transverse rungs , in which case one may expect a _",
    "double _ spontaneous symmetry breaking : between the parallel potential troughs , and , independently , between vicinities of the two rungs .",
    "in particular , a challenging problem would be to find an exact solution in the case when the pair of the rungs is represented by a symmetric set of two @xmath0-functions .",
