    "x - ray emission from isolated neutron stars ( nss ) , first detected in radio pulsars ( psrs ) , is now increasingly observed in other classes of sources , most of which are radio - silent or have radio properties much at variance with those of psrs .",
    "they include the thermally emitting nss ( xdinss ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the central compact objects in supernova remnants ( ccos ; e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnetar candidates ( sgrs and axps ; e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the rotating radio transients ( rrats ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    with the exception of some psrs , the x - ray emission of which is dominated by a non - thermal component of magnetospheric origin , the spectra of all other x - ray emitting , isolated nss exhibit one ( or more ) thermal component which , most probably , originates at the star surface . since pulsations are observed , thermal x - ray photons come either from a localized , heated region , like in sgrs / axps and psrs , or from the entire cooling surface with an inhomogeneous temperature distribution , like in xdinss . in this respect",
    "the analysis of the observed pulse profiles in different energy bands is bound to reveal much on the surface thermal map of the ns , on the physical size and position of the emitting regions(s ) in particular ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , in their classic paper @xcite analyzed the emission from two antipodal , uniform , circular caps .",
    "although their approach contains no inherent complexity , the treatment of photon propagation in a schwarzschild spacetime leads to elliptic integrals and requires numerical evaluation . in general",
    ", resorting to a numerical approach is unavoidable every time a continuous surface temperature distribution , anisotropic emission and/or an arbitrary shape of the emission regions have to be accounted for .",
    "however , @xcite , by means of a clever approximation , has shown that simple , analytical expressions can be derived for the pulse profiles in full general relativity ( schwarzschild spacetime ) for point - like spots .    in this paper",
    "we make use of @xcite approximate treatment to extend his analysis to the case of finite , uniform , circular spots .",
    "our results are valid for an arbitrary number of spots , regardless of their size , temperature and mutual position on the star surface ( e.g. two different , non - antipodal caps ) .",
    "some more complex emission geometries ( like a cap surrounded by a corona ) can also be easily accommodated .",
    "the expression for the total observed flux is analytical and this makes our approach both simple and fast for the evaluation and comparison of pulse profiles with observations .",
    "let us consider a surface element @xmath0 on a neutron star of radius @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 and let us assume that the schwarzschild solution correctly describes the spacetime outside the star ( in the following @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "let us further introduce a spherical coordinate system , @xmath4 , centered on the star in such a way that the polar axis coincides with the line - of - sight ( los ; unit vector @xmath5 ) .",
    "the distance to the observer is @xmath6 .    because photon trajectories are not straight lines , the ray from @xmath7 which reaches the observer leaves the surface , with respect to the local normal , at an angle @xmath8 ( see figure [ rays ] ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given , implicitly , by the two equations    @xmath11^{-1/2}\\ ] ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the ray impact parameter @xcite .",
    "the ( monochromatic ) flux @xmath14 from @xmath0 detected by the observer is then    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the photon frequency and @xmath17 the specific intensity , both measured by the static observer at @xmath18 .",
    "the total flux is obtained by integrating the previous expression over the visible part of the emitting region , @xmath19 .",
    "if the emission is planckian at the local ( uniform ) temperature @xmath20 , @xmath21 and this results in    @xmath22    in newtonian gravity it is @xmath23 and the flux is simply proportional to the area of the visible emitting region projected in the plane of the sky .",
    "@xcite found that a simple , approximate expression can be used to link @xmath9 and @xmath10 , without the need to solve ( numerically ) eqs .",
    "( [ theta ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) ,    @xmath24    eq .",
    "( [ cosalp ] ) is remarkably accurate and produces a fractional error @xmath25 for @xmath26 . substituting @xmath27 and @xmath28 into eq .",

    "the latter , apart for the factor @xmath30 , is the analogue of the newtonian expression , while the former is a purely relativistic correction .",
    "the problem of computing the flux , once the geometry is fixed , is therefore reduced to that of determining @xmath19 and evaluating the two integrals @xmath31      in order to proceed further , we consider first the simplest case , in which the emitting region is a circular cap of semi - aperture @xmath32 with its center at @xmath33 . for the sake of simplicity , and also because this is the most common occurrence , we consider only the case ) . ]",
    "@xmath34 . moreover , we restrict to @xmath35 , since the case @xmath36 is reduced to the previous one upon the substitution @xmath37 , given the axial symmetry around the los .",
    "the @xmath38-integral in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 is immediate . by denoting with @xmath41 the cap boundary ( @xmath42 ) , it is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the limiting values of the co - latitude , which are discussed below .",
    "the function @xmath46 can be readily found noticing that a generic point on the cap boundary has coordinates @xmath47 . in a spherical coordinate system with the polar axis coincident with the cap axis ( unit vector @xmath48 ) ,",
    "its coordinates are @xmath49 ; the latter system is rotated by an angle @xmath50 with respect to the former around an axis perpendicular to the @xmath51@xmath48 plane . by exploiting the transformation between the ( cartesian ) coordinates in the two systems , one gets    @xmath52    @xmath53    solving the second for @xmath54 and substituting into the first one , one finally obtains    @xmath55    @xmath56 is actually related to the function @xmath57 introduced by @xcite .",
    "it is immediate to verify that it is @xmath58 , and hence @xmath46 is defined , in the range @xmath59}$ ] , since it must be , by definition , @xmath60 .",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath10-range in which it is possible to define @xmath56 is not sufficient to cover the entire cap when the los intersects the cap itself : this occurs either for @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "since it is @xmath63 by assumption and disregarding visibility , there is just one intersection , at @xmath64 or @xmath65 . in these cases",
    "the cap is fully covered only by adding the range @xmath66 or @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this accounts for the missing surface which is itself a circular cap , perpendicular to the los , where @xmath38 spans the entire range @xmath68 $ ] ( see fig . [ caps ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the definition of @xmath41 can be continuously extended as    @xmath69 } & \\vert\\theta_o-\\theta_c\\vert<\\theta<\\min{[\\theta_o+\\theta_c , 2\\pi-(\\theta_o+\\theta_c ) ] }   \\cr \\cr \\pi & 0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\vert\\theta_o-\\theta_c\\vert \\quad \\mathrm{if}\\ \\theta_o-\\theta_c\\leq0\\cr & 2\\pi-(\\theta_o+\\theta_c)\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi \\quad \\mathrm{if}\\ \\theta_o+\\theta_c\\geq\\pi \\cr \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    to include all cases .    at each visible point of the star surface it has to be @xmath70 , and the terminator lies precisely at @xmath71 . from eq .",
    "( [ cosalp ] ) it follows that the terminator co - latitude is given by    @xmath72    it is @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as expected , since relativistic effects bring more than half the sphere into view .    in the case",

    "the presence of the terminator ( at @xmath78 ) is easily accounted for by replacing @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , as defined above , with @xmath79 every time it is @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "it is then @xmath93 .",
    "we note that @xmath90 take a simple form for @xmath94 .",

    "we stress that this is possible because , using beloborodov s approximation , the flux is proportional to the `` effective '' area of the cap , @xmath99 , introduced in the previous section .",
    "although we impose no restrictions on the parameters , the assumption that the spots do not intersect is understood . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", here we consider just two circular , uniform caps with semi - aperture @xmath100 , and temperature @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "let us further assume that the spots are aligned , in the sense that their centers lie on the same meridian ( the more general case of misaligned caps will be discussed in the next section ) , and let @xmath103 be the relative angular displacement of second one with respect to the first , the center of which is at @xmath50 ( of course it is @xmath104 ) .",

    "for a ns with a thermal map made of two ( antipodal ) caps at @xmath107 while the rest of the surface is at @xmath108 , one obtains the flux by using twice eq .",
    "( [ capcor ] ) with @xmath110 , the second time replacing @xmath50 with @xmath111 , and summing the two contributions .",

    ". observed periods in x - ray emitting inss are in the range @xmath11810 s , so the assumption of schwarzschild spacetime previously introduced is fully justified .",
    "we also introduce the angles @xmath119 , @xmath120 between the los , the cap axis and the rotation axis , respectively , i.e. @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    since the cap co",

    "figure [ pp - one ] shows the case of a single spot for @xmath141 ( left ) and @xmath142 ( right ) , small enough to te treated as point - like ( see  [ discus ] ) .",
    "the pulse profiles for two equal , antipodal ( @xmath143 ) spots are illustrated in figure [ pp - two ] , again for @xmath144 ( left ) and @xmath142 ( right ) .",

    "in this investigation we revisited the problem of computing the pulse profiles from thermally emitting spots on the surface of a neutron star in general relativity .",
    "our goal has been to develop a simple approach which can be readily used for a quantitative comparison of models with observations .",
    "@xcite , by means of a suitable approximation , was able to derive analytical expressions for the pulse profiles in full gr for point - like , equal , antipodal spots .",
    "however , if more realistic thermal configurations are to be accounted for , going beyond the point - like approximation becomes necessary .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to extend beloborodov s approach to include ( multiple ) spots of finite size in different positions on the star surface .",
    "results for the pulse profiles are expressed by comparatively simple analytical formulas which involve only elementary functions .",
    "a qualitative comparison between point - like and finite - size spots is provided by figures [ pp - one ] ( single spot ) and [ pp - two ] ( two equal , antipodal spots ) ; since @xmath151 produces a vanishing flux , @xmath142 was used instead to simulate a ( nearly ) point - like spot ( see below ) .",
    "indeed , the pulse profiles in figure [ pp - two ] ( right ) appear very similar to those discussed by ( * ? ? ?",

    "4 ) and the four `` types '' he introduced ( class i , ii , iii , iv ) are clearly recognizable .",
    "this is better seen in figure [ pf - comp ] ( right ) , where the pulsed fraction , defined as @xmath152 , is shown as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , together with beloborodov s analytical result ( his eq .",
    "the two sets of contours are nearly indistinguishable and the maximum pulsed fraction , equal to @xmath153 for point - like spots , is the same .    as expected , for larger caps the pulse shape changes , the `` plateau '' disappears and the pulsed fraction decreases ( figure [ pp - two ] , left ) .",
    "now the constant pf contours are quite different with respect to those of a point - like spot , as clearly shown in the left panel of figure [ pf - comp ] .",
    "the maximal pulsed fraction is @xmath154 lower than @xmath153 for @xmath141 . in general",
    ", we find that the point - like approximation is reliable up to @xmath155 .",
    "larger caps can be treated either using the approach described here or resorting to methods based on general relativistic ray - tracing .",
    "we believe that the former offers a number of advantages , since it involves no numerical integration , and allows for a great flexibility , so that diverse thermal configurations of the ns surface can be modeled .",
    "an obvious limitation is that only purely blackbody ( or at any rate isotropic ) emission can be treated . despite this simple model",
    "is often successfully used in fitting the ( thermal components ) of x - ray spectra , emission from the cooling surface of isolated neutron stars is expected to be more complicated , e.g. because the star is covered by an atmosphere , or because the emissivity is strongly suppressed at energies below the electron plasma frequency if the surface layers are in condensed form ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "realistic emission models predict , to a different extent , an angular dependence of the emitted intensity .",
    "while anisotropy is modest for non - magnetized atmospheric models @xcite , it becomes substantial in magnetized atmospheres @xcite    , or in condensed surfaces @xcite .",
    "in general , it would be impossible to compute analytically the analogues of @xmath90 ( see  [ single ] ) for a non - isotropic radiation field .",
    "we point out , however , that in case the intensity depends on the angle @xmath9 only , i.e. @xmath156 by using eq .",
    "( [ cosalp ] ) , all the cosiderations presented in  [ single ] still hold , although now numerical integration is required to obtain the pulse profiles .",
    "this , being the integral just over a single variable , @xmath10 , adds only a modest complication and the present method has still advantages with respect to fully numerical ray - tracing .",
    "clearly this is not the case if @xmath17 depends on both angles , @xmath9 and the associated azimuth , since double integrals should be evaluated .",
