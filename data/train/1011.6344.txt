    "every living organism obtains the energy needed for its survival from the outside world .",
    "this energy can be in the form of sunlight or food ; but in both cases it is unstable and can not be utilized directly , so several energy - conversion steps are necessary .",
    "one of the most widely used intermediate forms for energy storage is the electrochemical proton gradient across lipid membranes , such as the inner mitochondrial membranes or plasma membranes in bacteria . to achieve and maintain this proton gradient",
    ", nature employs several different types of electron- or light - driven systems , where the energy of high - energetic electrons or absorbed photons is used for the energetically - uphill proton transfer from the negative ( @xmath0 ) to the positive ( @xmath1 ) sides of the membrane .",
    "here we discuss two mechanisms of energy conversion from the highly unstable electronic form of energy to the proton gradient , namely , proton pumps and redox loops @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms rely on the electrostatic interaction between electrons and protons , although the specific details of the proton pumps and the redox loops look very different .",
    "for example , in a proton pump , such as _ cytochrome c oxidase _ , electrons move mainly along the membrane , whereas protons move across the membrane , which results in an accumulation of the positive charge on the @xmath1-side and in the generation of a proton - motive force ( pmf ) @xcite . in the redox - loop mechanism of pmf generation , taking place in the nitrate respiratory chain of _",
    "e. coli _ bacterium , the _ neutral shuttle _ , carrying _ both _ protons and electrons , crosses the membrane .",
    "here , the charge accumulation occurs when electrons cross the membrane , just before embarking on the shuttle , and right after unloading from the shuttle @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the proton pump operating in the _ cytochrome c oxidase _ has no essential mechanically - moving parts , whereas the redox - loop mechanism is impossible without the molecular shuttle diffusing between the negative and the positive sides of the lipid membrane .    in general ,",
    "the treatment of the electron and proton transfer events is extremely difficult because the total number of the occupation states increases exponentially with the number of the electron- and proton - binding sites , when all of them are electrostatically coupled . in the present work , however , we show that both above - mentioned mechanisms of the transmembrane proton translocation can be described with a similar mathematical model , taking into account the coulomb interaction between _ one _ electron- and _ one _ proton - binding sites only , and neglecting electrostatic couplings to other sites .",
    "it is necessary to have at least three redox sites and three proton - binding sites in order to obtain a proton pumping effect and suppress a reverse flow of protons from the @xmath1-side to the @xmath0-side of the membrane . in the absence of strong coulomb interaction between all sites",
    ", there is no need to introduce a complete set of electron and proton occupation states ( as was done in our previous works , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which grows exponentially with the number of sites . instead",
    ", we now divide the whole system into clusters of strongly coupled sites .",
    "these clusters are described by their own set of occupation states , and the total number of the states in the system is equal to the sum ( not the product ! ) of the states in the clusters .",
    "the clusters are weakly coupled by electron tunneling terms and by proton transfer amplitudes , so that transitions between the clusters can be considered within perturbation theory .",
    "while in this work we present quite simple models , similar approaches can be applied to much more complicated biological systems , such as photosystem ii and the whole respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane @xcite .",
    "the quantum yield for the two models analyzed in this paper can be about 1 .",
    "why such a high quantum yield ?",
    "this can be explained from the fact that , in order to be transferred through the system , an electron needs to loose its energy .",
    "this can not be done via the environment because the reorganization energy is not large enough .",
    "consequently , electron transport occurs with the assistance of protons gaining this energy and being transferred to the positive side of the membrane .",
    "thus , the transfer of a single electron is accompanied by the transfer of a single proton and the corresponding currents are equal , which results in an almost perfect quantum yield .",
    "we consider a physical model describing an electron - coupled translocation of protons from the negative ( @xmath0 ) to the positive ( @xmath1 ) side of a membrane .",
    "the model consists of an interaction site , @xmath2 , containing a single electron level with energy @xmath3 and a single proton energy level characterized by the energy @xmath4 .",
    "we also introduce two electron sites , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , coupled to the electron site @xmath7 , and two proton sites , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , coupled to the proton site @xmath10 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the electron site @xmath5 is coupled to the electron source @xmath11 , and the site @xmath6 is connected to the electron drain @xmath12 .",

    "the strongly - interacting electron and proton sites @xmath7 and @xmath10 form a single ( interaction ) cluster , whereas the sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 separately form other four ( peripheral ) clusters .",

    "figures 3 , 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate that , at standard physiological conditions , the static redox - linked proton pump (  cco - pump \" ) efficiently converts the energy of electrons to the more stable energetic form of the proton electrochemical gradient across the membrane .      in many biological systems , electrons and protons can be transferred across a membrane by means of a molecular shuttle diffusing inside of the membrane , from one side to another . here",
    "we show that the mathematical model described in section ii can be successfully applied for a description of the redox loop mechanism , which utilizes the brownian motion of the shuttle @xmath13 carrying both electron , @xmath7 , and proton , @xmath10 , sites ( see fig .  2 ) .",
