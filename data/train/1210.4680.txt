    "anomalous x - ray pulsars / soft gamma - ray repeaters ( axps / sgrs ) are focused because of their huge energy release and peculiar behavior , suggesting that extra energy sources besides spin and accretion powers should play an important role there .",
    "magnetic energy would be one of the candidates , which was initially proposed .",
    "however , this viewpoint could be challenged by more and more observations .",
    "it is worth noting here that , to solve the energy budget would be a key to understand the nature of compact stars , the equation state of dense matter at supra - nuclear density .",
    "let s have a brief note on the history .",
    "rapid rotation was generally thought to be the only energy source for pulsar emission soon after the discovery of radio pulsars ( @xcite ) until the discovery of accretion - powered pulsars in x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , axps / sgrs have long spin periods ( thus low spindown power , their x - ray luminosities are much larger than their spindown powers ) and no binary companions , which rules out spin and accretion in binary system as the power sources for the emission .",
    "it was then proposed that sgr - like bursts as well as the persistent x - ray emission could plausibly be the result of field decay of ultra - magnetic neutron stars if mhd dynamo action in the proto - stars is very effective in case that the objects spin initially at periods of @xmath0ms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because of the starquakes in the crusts of normal neutron stars , a self - induction electric field is created .",
    "the strong electric field could initiate avalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere and certainly accelerate particles , resulting in a so - called _ magnetar corona _ ( @xcite ) , from which high - energy bursts could be observed .",
    "the power source of axps / sgrs is actually the magnetic energy through field - reconnection there .",
    "this magnetar model is very popular nowadays in the astrophysical community .",
    "unfortunately , many predictions ( see following sections ) in the magnetar model have _ never _ been confirmed with certainty yet by later observations , and we then have to revisit the real nature of axp / sgrs : are they really magnetars or alternatives ?",
    "we are repeatedly asking these questions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and try to conclude that axp / sgrs might not be magnetars but could be quark - star / fallback - disk systems .",
    "the periods and period derivatives of different kinds of pulsar - like stars are shown in fig .",
    "1 .     diagram .",
    "squares are for axps and sgrs , empty squares for the radio loud magnetars ( from mcgill online catalog ) , diamonds for x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdinss ) , stars for rotating radio transients ( rrats ) , filled circles for central compact objects ( ccos ) , and dots for normal pulsars ( from the atnf).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    we are summarizing possible observational evidence for magnetars below .    * strong dipole magnetic b - fields , measured by assuming magnetic dipole braking . * surface b - fields inferred from cyclotron absorptions if protons are responsible . * magnetic confinement of the giant flare tails after sudden release of magnetic energy . * magnetic suppression of scattering cress - section account for luminosity @xmath1 . * sgr - like bursts from the high - b psr j1846 - 0258 ( but , how about the low - b sgrs ? ) .",
    "* energy of both persistent & burst emissions , spectral modeling ( but model - dependent ) .",
    "* energetic supernova remnants associated with magnetars due to initial faster spins ( initial period @xmath2ms ) and higher b - fields ( @xmath3 g ) . * a proto - neutron star with small @xmath4 and high @xmath5 may result in a large kick velocity . *",
    "no radio emissions because of high b - field ( but transient emissions are detected ) . * energetic gamma - rays from outer gaps , to be detectable by fermi - lat . * the unexpected discovery of a low - b sgrs , @xmath6 g .",
    "* unexpected existence of transient magnetars and high - b psrs .",
    "* magnetar free precession caused by higher mountains due to higher b - field .",
    "in view of the failed predictions of the magnetar model , listed in  3 , we are obliged to think about alternative scenarios of axp / sgrs .",
    "we note that the peculiar manifestations of axp / sgrs would relate closely their inner structures , i.e. , the physics of dense matter at supranuclear density .",
    "it is well known that baryons of an evolved massive star should be significantly compressed during core - collapse supernova , but the nature of this compressed baryonic matter is still a matter of debate due to strong non - perturbative effects of the fundamental color interaction . at a few nuclear densities , neutron stars containing almost only neutrons ( and other hadrons )",
    "are presumed to born soon after supernova , while the remnant core might be composed by quark matter if the quark degrees of freedom would not be negligible there .",
    "nonetheless , an emergence of quark - cluster state would be possible if the coupling between quarks inside compact stars is still very strong , forming a solid quark matter star ( @xcite ) . an accretion - induced quake model for axp / sgrs",
    "is then proposed ( @xcite ) , in which the energy release during star quakes can be estimated as high as @xmath7 ergs , to be enough to power the sgr giant flares .",
    "strong ejection ( or wind ) would certainly occur during accretion - induced energy release and/or a star quake - induced burst , and the central star may undergo a period of wind braking . if axp / sgrs are braked by wind instead of magnetic dipole radiation , then their magnetosphere structure is different from that of normal pulsars .",
    "this may explain the non - detection in _ fermi _ observations of magnetars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the extended emission around axp 1e 1547.0 - 5408 may be a magnetism - powered pulsar wind nebula .",
    "under the wind braking scenario , a braking index smaller than three is expected .",
    "how can one finally differentiate the magnetar model and the quark - star / fallback - disk model ?",
    "x - ray polarimetry may play an important role in identifying the real equation of state of dense matter at supranuclear density ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are expecting such an advanced facility to give a final answer to this 80-year - longstanding problem .",
    "both the magnetar model and the fallback disk model for axp / sgrs are discussed .",
    "axp / sgrs could be magnetars , but the origin and presence of strong dipole field are challenged by recent observations . alternatively , both the bursts and persistent emissions of axp / sgrs could be understandable in the quark - star / fallback - disk model .",
