    "a vortex state is one of important features for applications of superconductors .",
    "vortex states depend on an external magnetic field and an external current .",
    "it is known that a magnetic field from a ferromagnet affects the vortex state of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "for example , a ferromagnet / superconductor hybrid structure enhances superconductivity , especially its critical magnetic field and its critical current @xcite .",
    "magnetic materials like a ferromagnet affect a superconductor .",
    "one of magnetic materials that attracts attention recently is a chiral helimagnet(chm ) .",
    "the chm has an interesting magnetic structure .",
    "the chm consists of spins that form the helical rotation along one direction .",
    "a spin structure of the chm comes from two interactions between nearest neighbor spins ; a ferromagnetic exchange interaction and the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "two nearest neighbor spins tend to be parallel due to the former interaction but tend to be perpendicular to each other due to the latter interaction . due to a competition between two interactions ,",
    "nearest neighbor spins slightly deviate from each other .",
    "this leads to a formation of the helically rotated arrangement .",
    "when a weak magnetic field is applied , the magnetic structure forms a soliton lattice .",
    "these magnetic structures have been observed experimentally @xcite .    in the previous study , we found that the chiral helimagnet affects a vortex configuration in a superconductor @xcite .",
    "vortices form a periodically modulated triangular lattice under an applied large magnetic field .    in this paper",
    ", we study effects of a chiral helimagnet on a vortex configuration in a superconductor in more detail .",
    "we compare vortex configurations with / without the magnetic field from the chm under the applied homogeneous magnetic field . in order to investigate vortex configurations , we solve the ginzburg - landau equations with the finite element method .",
    "we consider a chiral helimagnet / superconductor bilayer system in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we assume that the effect of the chiral helimagnet on the superconductor is given by an external magnetic field @xmath0 but effects of the superconductor on the chiral helimagnet are neglected . in this study ,",
    "the superconducting layer is considered as a two - dimensional system and only the perpendicular component of the magnetic field @xmath0 is taken into account .    in order to investigate vortex configurations in this bilayer system , we solve the ginzburg - landau equations , @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3",

    "the maxwell equation is included . the magnetic field from the chiral helimagnet @xmath0 is included in the external magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath0 is obtained from a hamiltonian for chiral helimagnet @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian consists of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction , the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction , and the zeeman energy ; @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a spin in the chiral helimagnet , @xmath17 is an exchange coefficient , @xmath18 is a dm vector . from this hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain the perpendicular component of the magnetic field @xmath19 ; @xmath20 the first term is a magnetic field from the chiral helimagnet @xmath0 , where @xmath21 + \\pi.\\ ] ] @xmath22 is strength of the magnetic field from the chm .",
    "the second term is an applied magnetic field @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is a normalized magnetic field , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a lattice constant .",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 is a modulus of the jacobi s elliptic function @xmath29 and determined by , @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "a relation between @xmath27 and @xmath24 is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .     and the applied magnetic field @xmath23 for @xmath33    a period of the helical rotation @xmath34",
    "is given by , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "a relation between @xmath37 and @xmath24 is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .    .",
    "]    we obtain stable states using the ginzburg - landau equations , which is solved by the finite element method @xcite .",
    "we show vortex configurations in a two - dimensional superconductor system under the @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "we take the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 are a penetration length and coherence length at @xmath41 , respectively ) , the temperature @xmath42 , and the ratio between two interactions @xmath43 , which is taken from the experimental data for cr@xmath44nbs@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the system sizes are @xmath46 .",
    "we take boundary conditions : ( a ) @xmath47,where @xmath48 is a normal vector to the surface , ( b ) edges in this system are free .     and @xmath49 .",

    "we show vortex configurations under the applied magnetic field in fig.[fig4]-[fig7 ] for @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an quantum flux . in figs.[fig4 ] ( a)-(c ) , their figures represent a distribution of the order parameter , the phase , and the magnetic field for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the case figs.[fig4 ] , the abrikosov lattice forms .",
    "when the magnetic field from the chiral helimagnet @xmath0 is given , vortex configurations change to fig.[fig5]-[fig7 ] , where @xmath54 are @xmath55 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) , @xmath56 ( fig.[fig6 ] ) , and @xmath57 ( fig.[fig7 ] ) and @xmath58 are fixed to @xmath56 . under @xmath0 , triangular lattices are modulated .",
    "we can explain this result by a following reason ; this modulation comes from the magnetic field from the chiral helimagnet @xmath0 .",
    "the chiral helimagnet has a helical magnetic structure , so @xmath59-component of the magnetic field @xmath60 oscillates spatially . for @xmath61 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath62 changes from @xmath63 to @xmath55 and @xmath64 changes from @xmath55 to @xmath65 for @xmath50 .",
    "vortices tend to appear in the large magnetic field region and avoid in the small magnetic field region due to an interaction between the vortex and the magnetic field .",
    "the latter interaction @xmath66 is given by , @xmath67 therefore , a periodic modulated triangular lattice is formed .    here",
    ", we discuss a dynamics of a vortex under the applied magnetic field and the magnetic field from the chiral helimagnet .",
    "when a current flows along the @xmath68-direction , vortices move along the @xmath69-direction .",
    "however , under @xmath0 , vortices is difficult to move through the region where the magnetic field is low or negative .",
    "therefore , a movement of a vortex is restricted and a pinning effect of the vortex due to the chiral helimagnet is expected",
    ". this leads to the increase of the critical current .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the chiral helimagnet on the vortex configuration . under the applied magnetic field and the magnetic field from the chm",
    ", vortices form the periodically modulated triangular lattice .",
    "it is expected that this vortex configuration leads to a pinning effect and the increase of the critical current .",
