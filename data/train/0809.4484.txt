    "elections have played an important role in human societies for thousands of years .",
    "for example , elections were of central importance in the democracy of ancient athens . there citizens typically could only agree ( vote _ yes _ ) or disagree ( vote _ no _ ) with the speaker , and simple majority - rule was in effect",
    ". the mathematical study of elections , give or take a few discussions by the ancient greeks and romans , was until recently thought to have been initiated only a few hundred years ago , namely in the breakthrough work of borda and condorcet  later in part reinvented by dodgson ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for reprints of these classic papers ) .",
    "one of the most interesting results of this early work is condorcet s observation  @xcite that if one conducts elections with more than two alternatives then even if all voters have rational ( i.e. , transitive ) preferences , the society in aggregate can be irrational ( indeed , can have cycles of strict preference ) .",
    "nonetheless , condorcet believed that if there exists a candidate @xmath11 such that @xmath11 defeats each other candidate in head - to - head contests then @xmath11 should win the election ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . such a candidate is called a condorcet winner .",
    "clearly , there can be at most one condorcet winner in any election , and there might be none .",
    "this understanding of history has been reconsidered during the past few decades , as it has been discovered that the study of elections was considered deeply as early as the thirteenth century ( see hgele and pukelsheim  @xcite and the citations therein regarding ramon llull and the fifteenth - century figure cusanus , especially the citations that in  @xcite are numbered 3 , 5 , and 2427 ) .",
    "ramon llull ( b.  1232 , d.  1315 ) , a catalan mystic , missionary , and philosopher developed an election system that ( a ) has an efficient winner - determination procedure and ( b ) elects a condorcet winner whenever one exists and otherwise elects candidates that are , in a certain sense , closest to being condorcet winners .",
    "llull s motivation for developing an election system was to obtain a method of choosing abbesses , abbots , bishops , and perhaps even the pope .",
    "his election ideas never gained public acceptance in medieval europe and were long forgotten .",
    "it is interesting to note that llull allowed voters to have so - called _ irrational _ preferences . given three candidates , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , it was perfectly acceptable for a voter to prefer @xmath11 to @xmath12 , @xmath12 to  @xmath13 , and @xmath13 to  @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , in modern studies of voting and election systems each voter s preferences are most typically modeled as a linear order over all candidates .",
    "( in this paper , as is common when discussing elections , `` linear order '' implies strictness , i.e. , no tie in the ordering ; that is , by `` linear order '' we mean a strict , complete order , i.e. , an irreflexive , antisymmetric , complete , transitive relation . )",
    "yet allowing irrationality is very tempting and natural .",
    "consider bob , who likes to eat out but is often in a hurry .",
    "bob prefers diners to fast food because he is willing to wait a little longer to get better food .",
    "also , given a choice between a fancy restaurant and a diner he prefers the fancy restaurant , again because he is willing to wait somewhat longer to get better quality .",
    "however , given the choice between a fast - food place and a fancy restaurant bob might reason that he is not willing to wait so much longer to be served at the fancy restaurant and so will choose fast food instead . thus regarding catering options , bob s preferences are irrational in our sense , i.e. , intransitive .",
    "when voters make their choices based on multiple criteria  a very common and natural occurrence both among humans and software agents  such irrationalities can occur .",
    "llull s election system is remarkably similar to what is now known as `` copeland elections ''  @xcite , a more than half - century old voting procedure that is based on pairwise comparisons of candidates : the winner ( by a majority of votes  in this paper `` majority '' always , as is standard , means strict majority ) of each such head - to - head contest is awarded one point and the loser is awarded zero points ; in ties , both parties are ( in the most common interpretation of copeland s meaning ) awarded half a point ; whoever collects the most points over all these contests ( including tie - related points ) is the election s winner . in fact , the point value awarded for ties in such head - to - head majority - rule contests is treated in two ways in the literature when speaking of copeland elections : half a point ( most common ) and zero points ( less common ) . to provide a framework that can capture both those notions , as well as capturing llull s system and the whole family of systems created by choices of how we value ties , we propose and introduce a parameterized version of copeland elections , denoted by @xmath1 , where the parameter @xmath2 is a rational number , @xmath5 , and in the case of a tie both candidates receive @xmath2 points .",
    "so the system widely referred to in the literature as `` copeland elections '' is copeland@xmath6 , where tied candidates receive half a point each ( see , e.g. , merlin and saari  @xcite ; the definition used by conitzer et al .",
    "@xcite can be scaled to be equivalent to copeland@xmath6 ) .",
    "copeland@xmath8 , where tied candidates come away empty - handed , has sometimes also been referred to as `` copeland elections '' ( see , e.g. , procaccia , rosenschein , and kaminka  @xcite and an early version of this paper  @xcite ) .",
    "the above - mentioned election system proposed by ramon llull in the thirteenth century is in this notation copeland@xmath9 , where tied candidates are awarded one point each , just like winners of head - to - head contests.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the group stage of the fifa world cup finals is in essence a collection of copeland@xmath14 tournaments . at first glance",
    ", one might be tempted to think that the definitional perturbation due to the parameter @xmath2 in @xmath1 elections is negligible .",
    "however , it in fact can make the dynamics of llull s system quite different from those of , for instance , copeland@xmath6 or copeland@xmath8 .",
    "specific examples witnessing this claim , both regarding complexity results and regarding their proofs , are given at the end of section  [ sec : introduction : results ] .    finally , we mention that a probabilistic variant of copeland voting ( known as the jech method ) was defined already in 1929 by zermelo  @xcite and later on was reintroduced by several other researches ( see , e.g. , the paper of levin and nalebuff  @xcite for further references and a description of the jech method ) .",
    "we note in passing that the jech method is applicable even when it is fed incomplete information . in the present paper",
    ", however , we do not consider incomplete - information or probabilistic scenarios , although we commend such settings as interesting for future work .      in general",
    "it is impossible to design a perfect election system . in the 1950s arrow  @xcite",
    "famously showed that there is no social choice system that satisfies a certain small set of arguably reasonable requirements , and later gibbard  @xcite , satterthwaite  @xcite , and duggan and schwartz  @xcite showed that any natural election system can sometimes be manipulated by strategic voting , i.e. , by a voter revealing different preferences than his or her true ones in order to affect an election s result in his or her favor .",
    "also , no natural election system with a polynomial - time winner - determination procedure has yet been shown to be resistant to all types of control via procedural changes .",
    "control refers to attempts by an external agent ( called `` the chair '' ) to , via such actions as addition / deletion / partition of candidates or voters , make a given candidate win the election ( in the case of constructive control  @xcite ) or preclude a given candidate s victory ( in the case of destructive control  @xcite ) .",
    "these obstacles are very discouraging , but the field of computational social choice theory grew in part from the realization that computational complexity provides a potential shield against manipulation / control / etc .",
    "in particular , around 1990 , bartholdi , tovey , and trick  @xcite and bartholdi and orlin  @xcite brilliantly observed that while we perhaps might not be able to make manipulation ( i.e. , strategic voting ) and control of elections impossible , we could at least try to make such manipulation and control so computationally difficult that neither voters nor election organizers will attempt it . for example , if there is a way for a committee s chair to set up an election within the committee in such a way that his or her favorite option is guaranteed to win , but the chair s computational task would take a million years , then for all practical purposes we may feel that the chair is prevented from finding such a set - up .    since the seminal work of bartholdi , orlin , tovey , and trick , a large body of research has been dedicated to the study of computational properties of election systems .",
    "some topics that have received much attention are the complexity of manipulating elections @xcite and of controlling elections via procedural changes  @xcite .",
    "recently , faliszewski , hemaspaandra , and hemaspaandra introduced the study of the complexity of bribery in elections ( @xcite , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "bribery shares some features of manipulation and some features of control .",
    "in particular , the briber picks the voters he or she wants to affect ( as in voter control problems ) and asks them to vote as he or she wishes ( as in manipulation ) .",
    "( for additional citations and pointers , see the recent survey  @xcite . )    in this paper we study @xmath1 elections with respect to the computational complexity of bribery and procedural control ; see  @xcite for a study of manipulation within @xmath1 .",
    "the study of election systems and their computational properties , such as the complexity of their manipulation , control , and bribery problems , is an important topic in multiagent systems .",
    "agents / voters may have different , often conflicting , individual preferences over the given alternatives ( or candidates ) and voting rules ( or , synonymously , election systems ) provide a useful method for agents to come to a `` reasonable '' decision on which alternative to choose .",
    "thus elections can be employed in multiagent settings and also in other contexts to solve many practical problems . as just a few examples we mention the work of ephrati and rosenschein  @xcite where elections are used for planning , the work of ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite who developed a recommender system for movies that is based on voting , and the work of dwork et al .",
    "@xcite where elections are used to aggregate results from multiple web - search engines . in a multiagent setting we may have hundreds of elections happening every minute and we can not hope to carefully check in each case whether the party that organized the election attempted some procedural change to skew the results .",
    "however , if it is computationally hard to find such procedural changes then we can hope it is practically infeasible for the organizers to undertake them .    a standard technique for showing that a particular election - related problem ( for example , the problem of deciding whether the chair can make his or her favorite candidate a winner by influencing at most @xmath15 voters not to cast their votes ) is computationally intractable is to show that it is @xmath0-hard",
    "this approach is taken in almost all the papers on computational social choice cited above , and it is the approach that we take in this paper .",
    "one of the justifications for using @xmath0-hardness as a barrier against manipulation and control of elections is that in multiagent settings any attempts to influence the election s outcome are made by computationally bounded software agents that have neither human intuition nor the computational ability to solve @xmath0-hard problems .",
    "recently , such papers as @xcite have studied the frequency ( or sometimes , probability weight ) of correctness of heuristics for voting problems .",
    "although this is a fascinating and important direction , it does not at this point remove the need to study worst - case hardness .",
    "indeed , we view worst - case study as a natural prerequisite to a frequency - of - hardness attack : after all , there is no point in seeking frequency - of - hardness results if the problem at hand is in  @xmath16 to begin with . and",
    "if one can not even prove worst - case hardness for a problem , then proving `` average - case '' hardness is even more beyond reach .",
    "also , current frequency results have debilitating limitations ( for example , being locked into specific distributions ; depending on unproven assumptions ; and adopting `` tractability '' notions that declare undecidable problems tractable and that are not robust under even linear - time reductions )",
    ". these models are arguably not ready for prime time and , contrary to some people s impression , fail to imply average - case polynomial runtime claims .",
    "@xcite provide discussions of some of these issues .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study @xmath1 elections from the point of view of computational social choice theory , in the setting where voters are rational and in the setting where voters are allowed to have irrational preferences .",
    "( note : when we henceforward say `` irrational voters , '' we mean that the voters may have irrational preferences , not that they each must . )",
    "we study the issues of bribery and control and we point the reader to the work of faliszewski , hemaspaandra , and schnoor  @xcite for work on manipulation .",
    "( very briefly summarized , the work of faliszewski , hemaspaandra , and schnoor  @xcite on manipulation of @xmath1 elections shows that for all rational @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the coalitional manipulation problem in unweighted @xmath1 elections , even for coalitions of just two manipulators , is @xmath0-complete .",
    "some of the constructions of the present paper have been adopted or adapted in that paper in order to prove results about manipulation . )",
    "bribery and control problems have some very natural real - life interpretations . for example , during presidential elections a candidate might want to encourage as many of his or her supporters as possible to vote ( `` get - out - the - vote '' efforts ) : control via addition of voters ; elections can be held at an inconvenient date for a group of voters ( e.g. , a holiday ) or at a hard - to - reach location ( e.g. , requiring one to own a car , or such that getting to the location involves passing dangerous areas ) : control via deleting voters ; one can choose voting districts in a way favorable to a particular candidate or party ( gerrymandering ) : control via partitioning voters ; one can introduce a new candidate to the election in the hope that he or she will steal votes away from the opponents of one s favorite candidate without affecting the favorite candidate s performance : control via adding candidates .",
    "all the other control scenarios that we study also have natural interpretations .",
    "similarly , bribery is a natural and important issue in the context of elections .",
    "we stress , however , that bribery problems do not necessarily need to correspond to cheating or any sort of illegal action .",
    "one could view bribery problems as , for example , problems of finding the minimum number of voters who can switch the result of the election and , thus , as problems of finding coalitions , especially if one assigns prices to voters to measure the difficulty of convincing a particular voter to join the coalition ( see , e.g. , the paper of faliszewski  @xcite for an example of a bribery problem where such an interpretation is very natural ) .",
    "it is quite natural to study control and bribery both in constructive settings ( where we want to make our favorite candidate a winner ) and in destructive settings ( where we try to prevent a candidate from winning ) . in the context of real - life elections ,",
    "one often hears voters speaking of which candidate they hope will win , but one also often hears voters expressing the sentiment `` anyone but _",
    "him_. '' the constructive and destructive settings correspond to actions that agents belonging to these groups might be interested in .",
    "one of the main achievements of this paper is to classify which of resistance or vulnerability holds for @xmath1 in every previously studied control scenario for each rational value of  @xmath2 , @xmath5 . in doing so , we provide an example of a control problem where the complexity of copeland@xmath6 ( which is the system commonly referred to as `` copeland '' ) differs from that of both copeland@xmath8 and copeland@xmath9 : while the latter two problems are vulnerable to constructive control by adding ( an unlimited number of ) candidates , copeland@xmath6 is resistant to this control type ( see section  [ sec : prelims ] for definitions and theorem  [ thm : ccacu ] for this result ) .    in fact , copeland ( i.e. , copeland@xmath6 ) is the first natural election system ( with a polynomial - time winner problem ) proven to be resistant to every type of constructive control that has been proposed in the literature to date .",
    "this result closes a 15-year quest for a natural election system fully resistant to constructive control .",
    "we also show that @xmath1 is resistant to both constructive and destructive bribery , for both the case of rational voters and the case of irrational voters .",
    "our hardness proofs work for the case of unweighted voters without price tags ( see  @xcite ) and thus , naturally , apply as well to the more involved scenarios of weighted unpriced voters , unweighted priced voters , and weighted priced voters .    to prove our bribery results , we introduce a method of controlling the relative performances of certain voters in such a way that ,",
    "if one sets up other restrictions appropriately , the legal possibilities for bribery actions are sharply constrained .",
    "we call our approach `` the uv technique , '' since it is based on dummy candidates @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the proofs of theorems  [ thm : bribery : dest - copelandalpha ] and  [ thm : bribery : cons - copelandalpha ] are particular applications of this method .",
    "we feel that the uv technique will be useful , even beyond the scope of this paper , for the analysis of bribery in other election systems based on head - to - head contests .",
    "we also study @xmath1 elections under more flexible models such as `` microbribery '' ( see section  [ sec : microbribery : vulnerability ] ) and `` extended control '' ( see section  [ sec : control - fpt ] ) .",
    "we show that @xmath1 ( with irrational voters allowed ) is vulnerable to destructive microbribery and to destructive candidate control via providing fairly simple greedy algorithms .",
    "in contrast , our polynomial - time algorithms for constructive microbribery are proven via a technique involving min - cost network flows . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first application of min - cost flows to election problems .",
    "we believe that the range of applicability of flow networks to election problems extends well beyond microbribery for @xmath1 elections and we point the reader to a recent , independent paper by procaccia , rosenschein , and zohar  @xcite and to a paper by faliszewski  @xcite for examples of such applications .",
    "we also mention that during our study of copeland control we noticed that the proof of an important result of bartholdi , tovey , and trick  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  12 ) ( namely , that condorcet voting is resistant to constructive control by deleting voters ) is invalid .",
    "the invalidity is due to the proof centrally using nonstrict voters , in violation of bartholdi , tovey , and trick s @xcite ( and our ) model , and the invalidity seems potentially daunting or impossible to fix with the proof approach taken there .",
    "we note also that theorem  14 of the same paper has a similar flaw . in section  [ sec : control - condorcet ]",
    "we validly reprove their claimed results using our techniques .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : introduction : llull - copeland ] , @xmath1 elections may behave quite differently depending on the value of the tie - rewarding parameter  @xmath2 .",
    "we now give concrete examples to make this case .",
    "specifically , proofs of results for @xmath1 occasionally differ considerably for distinct values of  @xmath2 , and in some cases even the computational complexity of various control and manipulation problems ( for the manipulation case see  @xcite ) may jump between @xmath16 membership and @xmath0-completeness depending on  @xmath2 . regarding control , we have already noted that theorem  [ thm : ccacu ] shows that some control problem ( namely , control by adding an unlimited number of candidates ) for @xmath1 is @xmath0-complete for each rational @xmath2 with @xmath7 , yet theorem  [ thm : unlimited - adding - constructive ] shows that same control problem to be in @xmath16 for @xmath21 . to give another example involving a different control problem , namely control by partition of candidates with the ties - eliminate tie - handling rule ( see section  [ sec : prelims ] ) , we note that the proofs of theorem  [ thm : ccpc - te-1 ] ( which applies to @xmath22 for this control problem within @xmath1 ) and of theorem  [ thm : ccpc - te - smaller - than-1 ] ( which applies to all rational @xmath2 with @xmath23 for the same problem ) differ substantially . regarding constructive microbribery , the vulnerability constructions for @xmath24 ( see lemma  [ lem : bribery - prime - even - copeland - ties ] ) and @xmath22 ( see lemma  [ lem : bribery - prime - even - llull - ties ] ) significantly differ from each other , and neither of them works for tie - rewarding values other than @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the above remarks notwithstanding , for most of our results we show that it is possible to obtain a unified  though due to this uniformity sometimes rather involved  construction that works for @xmath1 for every rational  @xmath2 , @xmath25 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "prelims ] , we formalize the notion of elections and in particular of @xmath1 elections , we introduce some useful notation , and we formally define the control and bribery problems we are interested in . in section  [ sec : bribery ] , we show that for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath1 elections are fully resistant to bribery , both in the case of rational voters and in the case of irrational voters . on the other hand , if one changes the bribery model to allow `` microbribes '' of voters ( a fine - grained approach to bribery , in which the more one changes a voter s vote , the more one has to pay the voter ) , we prove vulnerability for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath5 , in the irrational - voters destructive case and for some specific values of @xmath2 in the irrational - voters constructive case . in sections  [ sec : control - candidate ] and",
    "[ sec : control - voter ] , we present our results on procedural control for @xmath1 elections for each rational @xmath2 with @xmath5",
    ". we will see that very broad resistance holds for the constructive - control cases .",
    "section  [ sec : control - fpt ] presents our results on fixed - parameter tractability of bounded - case control for @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ sec : control - condorcet ] provides valid proofs for several control problems for condorcet elections ( studied by bartholdi , tovey , and trick  @xcite ) whose original proofs were invalid due to being at odds with the model of elections used in  @xcite .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief summary in section  [ sec : conclusions ] and by stating some open problems .",
    "an _ election _ @xmath26 consists of a finite candidate set @xmath27 and a finite collection @xmath28 of voters , where each voter is represented ( individually , except later when we discuss succinct inputs ) via his or her preferences over the candidates .",
    "an _ election system _ ( or an _ election rule _ ) is a rule that determines the winner(s ) of each given election , i.e. , a mapping from pairs @xmath29 to subsets of  @xmath30 .",
    "we consider two ways in which voters can express their preferences . in the _ rational _ case ( our default case ) , each voter s preferences are represented as a linear order over the set @xmath30 , i.e. , each voter @xmath31 has a _ preference list _ @xmath32 , with @xmath33 . in the _ irrational _ case , each voter s preferences are represented as a _ preference table _ that for every unordered pair of distinct candidates @xmath34 and",

    "as mentioned earlier , in the literature the term `` copeland elections '' is most often used for the system copeland@xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite and a rescaled version of  @xcite ) , but has occasionally been used for copeland@xmath8 ( e.g. ,  @xcite and an early version of this paper  @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the system copeland@xmath9 was proposed by llull in the thirteenth century ( see the literature pointers given in the introduction ) and so is called llull voting .",

    "we use the following notation for rational voters .    within every election we fix some arbitrary order over the candidates .",
    "any occurrence of a subset @xmath58 of candidates in a preference list means the candidates from @xmath58 are listed with respect to that fixed order .",

    "for example , if @xmath60 , with the alphabetical order being used , and @xmath61 then @xmath62 means @xmath63 , and @xmath64 means @xmath65 .",
    "we now describe the computational problems that we study in this paper .",
    "our problems come in two flavors : constructive and destructive . in the constructive version",
    "the goal is to determine whether , via the bribery or control action type under study , it is possible to make a given candidate a winner of the election . in the destructive case",

    "to the best of our knowledge , this bounded - case approach to finding the limits of resistance results has not been previously used to study control problems . in this section",

    "we first start by briefly stating our notions and notations .",
    "we next state , and then prove , our fixed - parameter tractability results . regarding those ,",
    "we first address fpt results for the ( standard ) constructive and destructive cases .",
    "we then show that in many cases we can assert fpt results that are more general still  in particular , we will look at `` extended control '' : completely pinpointing whether under a given type of control we can ensure that at least one of a specified collection of `` copeland outcome tables '' ( to be defined later ) can be obtained .",
    "finally , we give our resistance results .",
    "the study of fixed - parameter complexity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) has been expanding explosively since it was parented as a field by downey , fellows , and others in the late 1980s and the 1990s .",
    "although the area has built a rich variety of complexity classes regarding parameterized problems , for the purpose of the current paper we need focus only on one very important class , namely , the class @xmath447 .",
    "briefly put , a problem parameterized by some value @xmath448 is said to be _ fixed - parameter tractable _ ( equivalently , to belong to the class @xmath447 ) if there is an algorithm for the problem whose running time is @xmath449 . (",
    "note in particular that there is some particular constant for the `` big - oh '' that holds for all inputs , regardless of what @xmath448 value the particular input has . )    in our context , we will consider two parameterizations : bounding the number of candidates and bounding the number of voters .",
    "we will use the same notations used throughout this paper to describe problems , except we will postpend a `` -bv@xmath450 '' to a problem name to state that the number of voters may be at most @xmath448 , and we will postpend a `` -bc@xmath450 '' to a problem name to state that the number of candidates may be at most @xmath448 . in each case , the bound applies to the full number of such items involved in the problem .",
    "for example , in the case of control by adding voters , the @xmath448 must bound the total of the number of voters in the election added together with the number of voters in the pool of voters available for adding .",
    "typically , we have been viewing input votes as coming in each on a ballot .",
    "however , one can also consider the case of succinct inputs , in which our algorithm is given the votes as `` ( preference - list , binary - integer - giving - frequency - of - that - preference - list ) '' pairs .",
    "( we mention in passing that for the `` adding voter '' cases , when we speak of succinctness we require that not just the always - voting voters be specified succinctly but also that the pool of voters - available - to - be - added be specified succinctly . )",
    "succinct inputs have been studied extensively in the case of bribery  @xcite , and speaking more broadly , succinctness - of - input issues are often very germane to complexity classification ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "note that proving an fpt result for the succinct case of a problem immediately implies an fpt result for the same problem ( without the requirement of succinct inputs being in place ) , and indeed is a stronger result , since succinctness can potentially exponentially compress the input .",
    "finally , we would like to be able to concisely express many results in a single statement . to do so",
    ", we borrow a notational approach from transformational grammar , and use square brackets as an `` independent choice '' notation .",
    "so , for example , the claim is a shorthand for six assertions : it runs ; she runs ; he runs ; it walks ; she walks ; and he walks .",
    "a special case is the symbol `` @xmath451 '' which , when it appears in such a bracket , means that when unwound it should be viewed as no text at all .",
    "for example , `` @xmath452 $ ] copeland is fun '' asserts both `` succinct copeland is fun '' and `` copeland is fun . ''",
    "we immediately state our main results , which show that for all the voter - control cases fpt schemes hold for both the bounded - voter and bounded - candidate cases , and for all the candidate - control cases fpt schemes hold for the bounded - candidate cases .    [",
    "t : v ] for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath453 , and each choice from the independent choice brackets below , the specified parameterized ( as @xmath448 varies over @xmath454 ) problem is in @xmath447 :    @xmath455 .",
    "[ t : c - bc ] for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath453 , and each choice from the independent choice brackets below , the specified parameterized ( as @xmath448 varies over @xmath454 ) problem is in @xmath447 :    @xmath456 .",
    "readers not interested in a discussion of those results and their proofs can at this point safely skip to the next labeled section header . before proving the above theorems ,",
    "let us first make a few observations about them .",
    "first , for cases where under a particular set of choices that same case is known ( e.g. , due to the results of sections  [ sec : control - candidate ] and  [ sec : control - voter ] ) to be in p even for the unbounded case , the above results are uninteresting as they follow from the earlier results ( such cases do not include any of the `` succinct '' cases , since those were not treated earlier ) .",
    "however , that is a small minority of the cases .",
    "also , for clarity as to what cases are covered , we have included some items that are not formally needed .",
    "for example , since fpt for the succinct case implies fpt for the no - succinctness - restriction case , and since fpt for the irrationality - allowed case implies fpt for the rational - only case , the first two choice brackets in each of the theorems could , without decreasing the results strength , be removed by eliminating their `` @xmath451 '' and `` @xmath1 '' choices .",
    "we now turn to the proofs .",
    "since proving every case would be uninterestingly repetitive , we will at times ( after carefully warning the reader ) prove the cases of one or two control types when that is enough to make clear how the omitted cases proofs go .",
    "let us start with those cases that can be done simply by appropriately applied brute force .    we first prove theorem  [ t : c - bc ] .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ t : c - bc ] . * if we are limited to having at most @xmath448 candidates , then for each of the cases mentioned , the total number of ways of adding / deleting / partitioning candidates is simply a ( large ) constant .",
    "for example , there will be at most ( `` at most '' rather than `` exactly '' since @xmath448 is merely an upper bound on the number of candidates ) @xmath457 possible run - off partitions and there will be at most @xmath458 relevant ways of deleting candidates ( since we ca nt ( destructive case ) or would never ( constructive case ) delete the distinguished candidate ) .",
    "so we can brute - force try all ways of adding / deleting / partitioning candidates , and for each such way can see whether we get the desired outcome .",
    "this works in polynomial time ( with a fixed degree independent of @xmath448 and @xmath2 ) even in the succinct case , and even with irrationality allowed .",
    "a brute - force approach similarly works for the case of voter control when the number of voters is fixed .",
    "in particular , we prove the following subcase of theorem  [ t : v ] .    [",
    "l : short ] for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath453 , and each choice from the independent choice brackets below , the specified parameterized ( as @xmath448 varies over @xmath454 ) problem is in @xmath447 :    @xmath459 .    when considering `` @xmath460 '' cases  namely in this proof and in the resistance section starting on page  we will not even discuss succinctness .",
    "the reason is that if the number of voters is bounded , say by @xmath448 , then succinctness does nt asymptotically change the input sizes interestingly , since succinctness at very best would compress the vote description by a factor of about @xmath448which in this case is a fixed constant ( relative to the value of the parameterization , which itself is @xmath448 ) .",
    "* proof of lemma  [ l : short ] . * if we are limited to having at most @xmath448 voters , note that we can , for each of these four types of control , brute - force check all possible approaches to that type of control .",
    "for example , for the case of control by deleting voters , we clearly have no more than @xmath457 possible vote deletion choices , and for the case of control by partitioning of voters , we again have at most @xmath457 partitions ( into @xmath116 and @xmath461 ) to consider .",
    "and @xmath457 is just a ( large ) constant .",
    "so a direct brute - force check yields a polynomial - time algorithm , and by inspection one can see that its run - time s degree is bounded above independently of @xmath448 .",
    "we now come to the interesting cluster of @xmath447 cases : the voter - control cases when the number of candidates is bounded .",
    "now , at first , one might think that we can handle this , just as the above cases , via a brute - force approach . and",
    "that is almost correct : one can get polynomial - time algorithms for these cases via a brute - force approach .",
    "however , for the succinct cases , the degrees of these algorithms will be huge , and _ will not be independent of the bound , @xmath448 , on the number of candidates_. for example , even in the rational case , one would from this approach obtain run - times with terms such as @xmath462 .",
    "that is , one would obtain a family of p - time algorithms , but one would not have an fpt algorithm . to overcome this obstacle , we will employ lenstra s  @xcite algorithm for bounded - variable - cardinality integer programming .",
    "although lenstra s algorithm is truly amazing in its power , even it will not be enough to accomplish our goal .",
    "rather , we will use a scheme that involves a fixed ( though very large ) number of lenstra - type programs each being focused on a different resolution path regarding the given problem .    what we need to prove , to complete the proof of theorem  [ t : v",
    "] , is the following lemma .",
    "[ t : leftover ] for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath453 , and each choice from the independent choice brackets below , the specified parameterized ( as @xmath448 varies over @xmath454 ) problem is in @xmath447 :    @xmath463 .",
    "let us start by recalling that , regarding the first choice bracket , the `` succinct '' case implies the `` @xmath451 '' case , so we need only address the succinct case .",
    "recall also that , regarding the second choice bracket , for each rational @xmath2 , @xmath5 , the `` '' case implies the `` '' case , so we need only address the @xmath42 case .",
    "so all that remains is to handle each pair of choices from the third and forth choice brackets . to prove every case",
    "would be very repetitive .",
    "so we will simply prove in detail a difficult , relatively representative case , and then will for the other cases either mention the type of adjustment needed to obtain their proofs , or will simply leave it as a simple but tedious exercise that will be clear , as to how to do , to anyone who reads this section .",

    "the top level of our algorithm is specified by the pseudocode in figure  [ f : top - level - code ] .",
    "( although this algorithm seemingly is just trying to tell whether the given control is possible for the given case , rather than telling how to partition to achieve that control , note that which iteration through the double loop accepts and the precise values of the variables inside the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem that made that iteration be satisfied will in fact tell us precisely what the partition is that makes the preferred candidate win . )    now , note that the total number of @xmath473-cots that exist ( we do not need to care whether all can be realized via actual votes ) is @xmath477 .",
    "so the code inside the two loops executes at most @xmath478 times , which is constant - bounded since @xmath479 , and we have fixed @xmath448 .",
    "so all that remains is to give the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem mentioned inside the inner loop .",
    "the setting here can sometimes be confusing , e.g. , when we speak of constants that can grow without limit .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that in this integer linear program constraint feasibility problem , the number of variables and constraints is constant ( over all inputs ) , and the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem s `` constants '' are the only things that change with respect to the input .",
    "this is the framework that allows us to invoke lenstra s powerful algorithm .",
    "we first specify the set of constants of the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem . in particular , for each @xmath143 , @xmath480 , we will have a constant , @xmath481 , that is the number of input voters whose vote is of the @xmath143th type ( among the @xmath482 possible vote possibilities ; keep in mind that voters are allowed to be irrational , thus the value @xmath482 is correct ) .",
    "note that the number of these constants that we have is itself constant - bounded ( for fixed @xmath448 ) , though of course the values that these constants ( of the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem ) take on can grow without limit .",
    "in addition , let us define some constants that will not vary with the input but rather are simply a notational shorthand that we will use to describe how the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem is defined ( what constraints occur in it ) .",
    "in particular , for each @xmath143 and @xmath346 such that @xmath483 , @xmath484 , and @xmath485 , let @xmath486 be @xmath4 if @xmath474 asserts that ( in their head - to - head contest ) @xmath143 ties or defeats @xmath346 , and let it be @xmath3 if @xmath474 asserts that ( in their head - to - head contest ) @xmath143 loses to @xmath346 .",
    "let @xmath487 be identically defined , except with respect to @xmath475 .",
    "informally put , these values will be used to let our integer linear program constraint feasibility problem seek to enforce such a win / loss / tie pattern with respect to the given input vote numbers and the given type of allowed control action . the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem s variables , which of course are all _ integer _ variables , are the following @xmath482 variables . for each @xmath143 , @xmath480",
    ", we will have a variable , @xmath488 , that represents how many of the @xmath481 voters having the @xmath143th among the @xmath482 possible vote types go into the first subelection .",
    "finally , we must specify the constraints of our integer linear program constraint feasibility problem .",
    "we will have three groups of constraints .",
    "the first constraint group is enforcing that plausible numbers are put in the first partition . in particular , for each @xmath143 , @xmath480 , we have the constraints @xmath489 and @xmath490 .",
    "the third constraint group has the same function as the second constraint group , except it regards the second subelection rather than the first subelection .",
    "in particular , for each @xmath143 and @xmath346 such that @xmath483 , @xmath484 , and @xmath492 , we do the following .",
    "consider again equation   from above , except with each of the two occurrences of @xmath500 replaced by @xmath501 .",
    "if @xmath502 we will have a constraint of that form with op set to `` @xmath496 '' .",
    "if @xmath503 we will have a constraint of that form with op set to `` @xmath498 '' .",
    "as above , this means that if @xmath504 , we will add two constraints .",
    "this completes the specification of the integer linear programming constraint feasibility problem .",
    "note that our top - level code , from figure  [ f : top - level - code ] , clearly runs within polynomial time relative to even the succinct - case input to the original @xmath505 problem , and that that polynomial s degree is bounded above independently of @xmath448 .",
    "note in particular that our algorithm constructs at most a large constant ( for @xmath448 fixed ) number of integer linear programming constraint feasibility problems , and each of those is itself polynomial - sized relative to even the succinct - case input to the original @xmath505 problem , and that polynomial size s degree is bounded above independently of @xmath448 .",
    "further , note that the integer linear programming constraint feasibility problems clearly do test what they are supposed to test  most importantly , they test that the subelections match the pairwise outcomes specified by @xmath473-cots @xmath474 and @xmath475 .",
    "finally and crucially , by lenstra s algorithm  ( @xcite , see also  @xcite which are very clear regarding the `` linear ' 's later in this sentence ) , since this integer linear programming constraint feasibility problem has a fixed number of constraints ( and in our case in fact also has a fixed number of variables ) , it can be solved  relative to its size ( which includes the filled - in constants , such as our @xmath481 for example , which are in effect inputs to the integer program s specification)via a linear number of arithmetic operations on linear - sized integers .",
    "so , overall , we are in polynomial time even relative to succinctly specified input , and the polynomial s degree is bounded above independently of @xmath448 .",
    "thus we have established membership in the class @xmath447 .",
    "we now describe very briefly how the above proof of lemma  [ t : first - example - case ] can be adjusted to handle all the partition cases from lemma  [ t : leftover ] , namely , the cases @xmath506 . as noted before",
    ", the first two brackets can be ignored , as we have chosen the more demanding choice for each .",
    "let us discuss the other variations .",
    "regarding changing from constructive to destructive , in figure  [ f : top - level - code ] change `` is a winner '' to `` is not a winner . ''",
    "regarding changing from pv - tp to pv - te , in the `` if '' block in figure  [ f : top - level - code ] change each `` all the candidates who win '' to `` the candidate who wins ( if there is a unique candidate who wins ) . ''",
    "the only remaining cases are the cases @xmath507 .",
    "however , these cases are even more straightforward than the partition cases we just covered , so for space reasons we will not write them out , but rather will briefly comment on these cases . basically , one s top - level code for these cases loops over all @xmath473-cots , and for each ( there are @xmath477 ) checks whether the right outcome happens under that @xmath473-cot ( i.e. , the distinguished candidate either is ( constructive case ) or is not ( destructive case ) a winner ) , and if so , it runs lenstra s algorithm on an integer linear programming constraint feasibility problem to see whether we can by the allowed action ( adding / deleting ) get to a state where that particular @xmath473-cot matches our ( after addition or deletion of voters ) election . in the integer program",
    ", the variables will be the obvious ones , namely , for each @xmath143 , @xmath480 , we will have a variable , @xmath488 , that describes how many voters of type @xmath143 to add / delete . as our key constants ( of the integer linear program constraint feasibility problem ) , we will have , for each @xmath143 , @xmath480 , a value , @xmath481 , for the number of type @xmath143 voters in the input . also , if this is a problem about addition of voters , we will have additional constants , @xmath508 , @xmath480 , representing the number of type @xmath143 voters among the pool , @xmath110 , of voters available for addition . and",
    "if our problem has an internal `` @xmath15 '' ( a limit on the number of additions or deletions ) , we enforce that with the natural constraints , as do we also with the natural constraints enforce the obvious relationships between the @xmath488 , @xmath481 , @xmath508 , and so on .",
    "most critically , we have constraints ensuring that after the additions / deletions specified by the @xmath488 , each pairwise outcome specified by the @xmath473-cot is realized .    finally , although everything in section  [ sec : control - fpt ] ( both the part so far and the part to come ) is written for the case of the nonunique - winner model , all the results hold analogously in the unique - winner model , with the natural , minor proof modifications .",
    "( also , we mention in passing that due to the connection , found in footnote  5 of  @xcite , between unique - winner destructive control and nonunique - winner constructive control , one could use some of our nonunique - winner constructive - case results to indirectly prove some of the unique - winner destructive - case results . )      in this section , we look at extended control . by",
    "that we do not mean changing the ten standard control notions of adding / deleting / partitioning candidates / voters .",
    "rather , we mean generalizing past merely looking at the constructive ( make a distinguished candidate a winner ) and the destructive ( prevent a distinguished candidate from being a winner ) cases . in particular , we are interested in control where the goal can be far more flexibly specified , for example ( though in the partition cases we will be even more flexible than this ) , we will allow as our goal region any ( reasonable  there are some time - related conditions ) subcollection of `` copeland outcome tables '' ( specifications of who won / lost / tied each head - to - head contest ) .",
    "since from a copeland outcome table , in concert with the current @xmath2 , one can read off the @xmath42 scores of the candidates , this allows us a tremendous range of descriptive flexibility in specifying our control goals , e.g. , we can specify a linear order desired for the candidates with respect to their @xmath42 scores , we can specify a linear - order - with - ties desired for the candidates with respect to their @xmath42 scores , we can specify the exact desired @xmath42 scores for one or more candidates , we can specify that we want to ensure that no candidate from a certain subgroup has a @xmath42 score that ties or defeats the @xmath42 score of any candidate from a certain other subgroup , etc.we mention up front that that initial example list applies with some additional minor technical caveats .",
    "those examples were speaking as if in the final election we have all the candidates receiving @xmath42 scores in the final election .",
    "but in fact in the partition cases this is not ( necessarily ) so , and so in those cases we will focus on the copeland outcome tables most natural to the given case .",
    "for example , in control by partition of voters , we will focus on subcollections of pairs of copeland outcome tables for the two subelections .",
    "also , though our copeland outcome tables as defined below are not explicitly labeled with candidate names , but rather use a lexicographical correspondence with the involved candidates , in some cases we would  though we do nt repeat this in the discussion below  need to allow the inclusion in the goal specification of the names of the candidates who are in play in a given table or tables , most particularly , in the cases of addition and deletion of candidates , and in some partition cases . ]",
    "later in this section we will give a list repeating some of these examples and adding some new examples .    all the fpt algorithms given in the previous section regard , on their surface , the standard control problem , which tests whether a given candidate can be made a winner ( constructive case ) or can be precluded from being a winner ( destructive case ) .",
    "we now note that the general approaches used in that section in fact yield fpt schemes even for the far more flexible notions of control mentioned above . in fact , one gets , for all the fpt cases covered in the previous section , fpt algorithms for the extended - control problem for those cases  very loosely put , fpt algorithms that test , for virtually any natural collection of outcome tables ( as long as that collection itself can be recognized in a way that does nt take too much running time , i.e. , the checking time is polynomial and of a degree that is bounded independently of @xmath448 ) , whether by the given type of control one can reach one of those outcome tables .",
    "let us discuss this in a bit more detail .",
    "a key concept used inside the proof of lemma  [ t : first - example - case ] was that of a copeland outcome table  a function that for each distinct pair of candidates specifies either a tie or specifies who is the ( not tied ) winner in their pairwise contest .",
    "let us consider the control algorithm given in the proof of that lemma , and in particular let us consider the top - level code specified in figure  [ f : top - level - code ] .",
    "that code double - loops over size @xmath473 copeland outcome tables ( a.k.a .  @xmath473-cots ) , regarding the subpartitions , and for each case when the outcome tables subelection cases , followed by the final election that they imply , correspond to the desired type of constructive ( the distinguished person wins ) or destructive ( the distinguished person does not win ) outcome , we check whether those two @xmath473-cots can be made to hold via the current type of control ( for the case being discussed , pv - tp ) .",
    "however , note that simply by easily varying that top - level code we can obtain a natural fpt algorithm ( a single algorithm , see footnote  [ f : not - family ] the analogue of which applies here ) for any question of whether via the allowed type of control one can reach any run - time - quick - to - recognize collection of pairs of @xmath473-cots ( in the subelection ) , or even whether a given candidate collection and one of a given ( run - time - quick - to - recognize ) @xmath509-cot collection over that candidate collection ( @xmath509 being the size of that final - round candidate collection ) can be reached in the final election .",
    "this is true not just for the partition cases ( where , informally put , we would do this by , in figure  [ f : top - level - code ] , changing the condition inside the `` if '' to instead look for membership in that collection of @xmath473-cots[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) but also for all the cases we attacked via lenstra s method ( though for the nonpartition cases we will typically single - loop over copeland outcome tables that may represent the outcome after control is exerted ; also , for some of these cases , the caveat at the end of footnote  [ f : tricky - caveat ] will apply ) . and",
    "it is even easier to notice that for those cases we attacked by direct brute force this also holds .",
    "so , as just a few examples ( some echoing the start of this section , and some new ) , all the following have ( with the caveats mentioned above about needed names attached , e.g. , in cases of candidate addition / deletion / partition , and regarding the partition cases focusing not necessarily directly on the final table ) fpt extended control algorithms for all the types of control and boundedness cases for which the fpt results of the previous section are stated .    1 .   asking whether under the stated action one can obtain in the final election ( simply in the election in the case when there is no partitioning ) the outcome that all the @xmath42-system scores of the candidates precisely match the relations of the lexicographic names of the candidates",
    ". 2 .   more generally than that , asking whether under the stated action one can obtain in the final election ( simply in the election in the case when there is no partitioning ) a certain linear - order - without - ties regarding the @xmath42-system scores of the candidates .",
    "3 .   more generally still , asking",
    "whether under the stated action one can obtain in the final election ( simply in the election in the case when there is no partitioning ) a certain linear - order - with - ties regarding the @xmath42-system scores of the candidates .",
    "4 .   asking",
    "whether under the stated action one can obtain in the final election ( simply in the election in the case when there is no partitioning ) the situation that exactly 1492 candidates tie as winner regarding their @xmath42-system scores .",
    "5 .   asking",
    "whether under the stated action one can obtain in the final election ( simply in the election in the case when there is no partitioning ) the situation that no two candidates have the same @xmath42-system scores as each other .",
    "again , these are just a very few examples .",
    "our point is that the previous section is flexible enough to address not just constructive / destructive control , but also to address far more general control issues .",
    "theorems  [ t : v ] and  [ t : c - bc ] give @xmath447 schemes for all voter - control cases with bounded voters , for all voter - control cases with bounded candidates , and for all candidate - control cases with bounded candidates .",
    "this might lead one to hope that all the cases admit @xmath447 schemes .",
    "however , the remaining type of case , the candidate - control cases with bounded voters , does not follow this pattern . in fact , we note that for @xmath42 all the candidate - control cases that we showed earlier in this paper ( i.e. , without bounds on the number of voters ) to be resistant remain resistant even for the case of bounded voters .",
    "this resistance holds even when the input is not in succinct format , and so it certainly also holds when the input is in succinct format .",
    "the reason for this is that , for the case of irrational voters , with just _ two _ voters ( with preferences over @xmath448 candidates ) any given @xmath448-cot can be achieved . to do this , for each distinct pair of candidates @xmath143 and @xmath346 , to have @xmath143 preferred in their pairwise contest have both voters prefer @xmath143 to @xmath346 , to have @xmath346 preferred in their pairwise contest have both voters prefer @xmath346 to @xmath143 , and to have a tie in the pairwise contest have one voter prefer @xmath346 to @xmath143 and one voter prefer @xmath143 to @xmath346 . since in the proofs of resistance for candidate control ,",
    "we identified elections with their election graphs , i.e. , with their cots , it is not hard to see that all these resistance proofs carry over even to the case of two irrational voters .    the only open cases remaining regard the rational - voter , candidate - control , bounded - voter cases .",
    "we note that betzler and uhlmann  @xcite have recently resolved some of these open issues .",
    "in this section we show that condorcet elections are resistant to constructive control via deleting voters ( ccdv ) and via partition of voters ( ccpv ) .",
    "these results were originally claimed in the seminal paper of bartholdi , tovey , and trick  @xcite , but the proofs there were based on the assumption that a voter can be indifferent between several candidates . their model of elections",
    "did not allow that ( and neither does ours ) . here",
    "we show how one can obtain these results in the case when the voters preference lists are linear orders  which is both their model and ours .",
    "recall that a candidate @xmath11 of election @xmath26 is a condorcet winner of @xmath40 if he or she defeats all other candidates in their head - to - head contests .",
    "alternatively , one could say that a candidate @xmath11 is a condorcet winner of election @xmath40 if and only if he or she has copeland@xmath8 score of @xmath54 .",
    "since each election can have at most one condorcet winner , it does nt make sense here to differentiate between the unique - winner and the nonunique - winner models .",
    "[ thm : ccdv - condorcet ] condorcet elections are resistant to constructive control via deleting voters .",
    "this follows immediately from the proof of theorem  [ thm : ucdv ] .",
    "note that a condorcet winner is always a unique @xmath1 winner , for each rational @xmath2 with @xmath5 , and note that in the proof of theorem  [ thm : ucdv ] , if @xmath342 contains a @xmath15-element cover of @xmath137 , then we can delete @xmath15 voters such that in the resulting election @xmath70 defeats every other candidate in their head - to - head , contest , i.e. , @xmath70 is a condorcet winner in the resulting election .     before we proceed with our proof of resistance for the case of constructive control via partition of voters ( ccpv ) , we have to mention a slight quirk of bartholdi , tovey , and trick s model of voter partition .",
    "if one reads their paper carefully , it becomes apparent that they have a quiet assumption that each given set of voters can only be partitioned into subelections that each elect exactly one winner , thus severely restricting the chair s partitioning possibilities .",
    "that was why hemaspaandra , hemaspaandra , and rothe  @xcite replaced bartholdi , tovey , and trick s convention with the more natural ties - promote and ties - eliminate rules ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) , but for this current section of our paper we go back to bartholdi , tovey , and trick s model , since our goal here is to reprove their results without breaking _ their _ model .",
    "[ thm : ccpv - condorcet ] condorcet elections are resistant to constructive control via partitioning voters ( ccpv ) in bartholdi , tovey , and trick s model ( see the paragraph above ) .",
    "the proof follows via a reduction from the x3c problem .",
    "in fact , we use exactly the construction from the proof of theorem  [ thm : cpv - tp ] .",
    "let @xmath26 be the election constructed in that proof . since @xmath207 is the only candidate that @xmath70 defeats in a head - to - head contest , the only way for @xmath70 to become a winner via partitioning voters is to guarantee that @xmath70 wins within his or her subelection and that @xmath207 wins within the other one .",
    "( note that since @xmath70 is not a condorcet winner , @xmath70 can not win in both subelections . )",
    "if @xmath342 contains a @xmath15-element cover , say , @xmath510 , then letting @xmath511 and @xmath512 will make @xmath70 the condorcet winner in this ccpv scenario .    for the converse , let @xmath513 be a partition of the collection of voters such that @xmath70 is the global condorcet winner in the ccpv scenario where we use two subelections , one with voters @xmath514 and one with voters @xmath515 . via the above paragraph we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath70 is the condorcet winner in @xmath516 and that @xmath207 is the condorcet winner in @xmath517 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath515 contains the @xmath428 voters in @xmath518 ( i.e. , the voters with preference @xmath422 ) .",
    "also , @xmath515 contains at most @xmath15 voters from @xmath429 , as otherwise @xmath207 would certainly not be a condorcet winner in @xmath517 .    as a result",
    ", @xmath70 can be made the condorcet winner of @xmath430 by deleting at most @xmath15 voters .",
    "it follows from claim  [ cl : llull - dv ] that @xmath342 contains a @xmath15-element cover of @xmath137 .",
    "we have shown that from the computational point of view the election systems of llull and copeland ( i.e. , copeland@xmath6 ) are broadly resistant to bribery and procedural control , regardless of whether the voters are required to have rational preferences .",
    "it is rather charming that llull s 700-year - old system shows perfect resistance to bribery and more resistances to ( constructive ) control than any other natural system ( even far more modern ones ) with an easy winner - determination procedure ",
    "other than , @xmath7is known to possess , and this is even more remarkable when one considers that llull s system was defined long before control of elections was even explicitly studied .",
    "copeland@xmath6 voting matches llull s perfect resistance to bribery and in addition has perfect resistance to ( constructive ) control",
    ". a natural open direction would be to study the complexity of control for additional election systems .",
    "particularly interesting would be to find existing , natural voting systems that have polynomial - time winner determination procedures but that are resistant to all standard types of both constructive _ and destructive _ control .",
    "also extremely interesting would be to find single results that classify , for broad families of election systems , precisely what it is that makes control easy or hard , i.e. , to obtain dichotomy meta - results for control ( see hemaspaandra and hemaspaandra  @xcite for some discussion regarding work of that flavor for manipulation ) .",
