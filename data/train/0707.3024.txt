    "leptogenesis @xcite , a cosmological consequence of the see - saw mechanism @xcite , provides an attractive explanation for the baryon asymmetry of the universe , one of the most long - standing cosmological puzzles .",
    "a lepton asymmetry is produced in the decays of the very heavy rh neutrinos predicted by the see - saw mechanism . in order for the ( @xmath4 conserving )",
    "sphaleron processes to be able to convert part of the lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry , very high temperatures , @xmath5 , are required in the early universe @xcite .    in comparison with other models of baryogenesis",
    ", leptogenesis offers the unique advantage of relying on an ingredient of physics beyond the standard model , neutrino masses , already confirmed by the experiments . furthermore and very interestingly",
    ", a quantitative analysis @xcite shows that the values of the atmospheric and of the solar neutrino mass scales , inferred from neutrino mixing experiments , favor leptogenesis to work in a mildly ` strong wash - out regime ' : inverse processes are strong enough to wash - out any contribution to the final asymmetry depending on the initial conditions but not too strong to prevent successful leptogenesis . in this way",
    "the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry can be unambiguously explained within a minimal extension of the sm where rh neutrinos with a majorana mass term and yukawa couplings are added to the sm lagrangian and the see - saw limit is assumed .",
    "no particular assumptions on the initial conditions are required , in complete analogy with what happens in the calculation of the primordial nuclear abundances within standard big bang nucleosynthesis .    in a typical @xmath6-dominated scenario",
    ", the asymmetry is dominantly produced from the decays of the lightest rh neutrino @xmath6 .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition is the assumption of a mild hierarchy in the heavy neutrino mass spectrum , such that @xmath7 , the mass of the next - to - lightest rh neutrino , is approximately three times larger than @xmath8 , the mass of the lightest rh neutrino @xcite .    in an unflavored analysis ,",
    "a stringent lower bound on @xmath8 holds @xcite . in the decoupling limit ,",
    "when the @xmath6-decay parameter @xmath9 and assuming an initial thermal abundance , one finds .",
    "here we are using a slightly higher value that is obtained , as we will see , when the reduced experimental error on the baryon asymmetry and on the atmospheric neutrino mass scale is taken into account . ]",
    "@xmath10 @xcite . however , there are different drawbacks for the saturation of this lower bound that is anyway strongly model dependent . a more significant and stringent lower bound , @xmath11 ,",
    "is obtained at the onset of the strong wash - out regime , @xmath12 @xcite , where the final asymmetry does not depend on the initial conditions .",
    "this lower bound implies an associated lower bound @xcite , @xmath13 , on the value of the temperature at the beginning of the standard radiation dominated regime , the reheating temperature within inflation .    as we said , the assumption of a mild hierarchy in the heavy neutrino mass spectrum is not sufficient to guarantee that the @xmath6-dominated scenario holds .",
    "it is indeed possible that , for a proper choice of the see - saw parameters , a @xmath14-dominated scenario holds , where the final asymmetry is dominated by the contribution from the decays of the next - to - lightest rh neutrino @xmath14 @xcite . in this case",
    "the lower bound on @xmath8 does not hold any more and is replaced by a lower bound on @xmath7 , however still implying a lower bound on @xmath15 .",
    "even when flavor effects @xcite are taken into account , violation relevant for leptogenesis , it was first discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "these lower bounds do not get relaxed @xcite .",
    "in particular , flavor effects do not help to alleviate the conflict with the upper bound on the reheating temperature coming from the avoidance of the gravitino problem when a supersymmetric framework is considered @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "flavor effects relax the lower bound on @xmath8 for @xmath16 @xcite and , interestingly , it has been shown that the dirac phase and , more efficiently , the majorana phases can strongly enhance the amount of the relaxation @xcite .",
    "besides this effect , there is an even more interesting role played by the majorana and dirac phases when flavor effects are taken into account . in an unflavored analysis ,",
    "the final asymmetry does not depend on the low - energy phases and this represents a limit to the possibility of further tightening the link between leptogenesis predictions and low - energy neutrino experiments .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that , accounting for flavor effects , an asymmetry can be generated even when the total @xmath2 asymmetry vanishes .",
    "this is possible because flavor effects introduce an additional source of @xmath2 asymmetry stemming from low - energy phases .",
    "the flavor composition of the anti - lepton produced in the decay of the rh neutrino can be indeed different from the one of the @xmath2 conjugated lepton . in this way",
    "a new intriguing scenario arises , where the majorana and the dirac phases , potentially observable in low - energy neutrino experiments , could act as the unique source of @xmath2 violation responsible for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "first calculations have been presented in @xcite for particular values of @xmath8 and within a two rh neutrino scenario , corresponding to a specific choice of the see - saw orthogonal matrix @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it has been first shown that successful leptogenesis stemming only from low - energy phases is possible and the lower bound on @xmath8 , with its dependence on @xmath17 and on the initial conditions , has been calculated for a specific choice of the see - saw orthogonal matrix in the hl .",
    "it has been found that for values of @xmath17 in the strong wash - out regime , the allowed region is very constrained when just majorana phases are switched on , and it is even worse when only the dirac phase is switched on , even for @xmath3 close to its experimental upper bound . compared to the usual cases where high - energy phases contribute to @xmath2 violation as well , the lower bounds on @xmath8 and on the reheating temperature get much more stringent , especially in the strong wash - out regime and in particular for values of @xmath17 in the range favored by neutrino mixing experiments .",
    "therefore , one can say that the asymmetry production from low - energy phases is somehow secondary compared to the usual case when leptogenesis proceeds from the high - energy phases contained in the see - saw orthogonal matrix .",
    "this conclusion has been recently confirmed also in @xcite in the context of mssm . in @xcite ,",
    "the results have been generalized for an arbitrary choice of the orthogonal matrix and of the low - energy phases but without a study of the dependence on @xmath17 and on the initial conditions .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the particularly interesting case of @xmath0-leptogenesis , where the dirac phase , which has realistic chances to be observed in neutrino mixing experiments for not too small values of @xmath3 , is the only non - vanishing phase .",
    "we study the dependence of the final asymmetry on the initial conditions , finding the onset of the strong wash - out regime and showing the dependence of the @xmath8 lower bound on the important decay parameter @xmath17 , whose value is related to the values of the neutrino masses and at the same time determines the efficiency of the asymmetry production ( involving both the production of the heavy neutrinos and the wash - out ) .",
    "we first obtain that , in the hl , the possibility to explain the observed asymmetry is only marginally allowed and just limited to the less relevant weak wash - out regime , when the correct condition for the validity of the fully flavored regime is taken into account @xcite",
    ". then we point out that this obstacle can be nicely circumvented going beyond the hl .",
    "indeed , like in the unflavored case @xcite , the flavored @xmath2 asymmetries , and consequently the final @xmath4 asymmetry , get enhanced and the lower bounds on @xmath8 and on @xmath15 get relaxed .",
    "the possibility of @xmath0-leptogenesis beyond the hl has been already studied in @xcite within resonant leptogenesis @xcite , where the heavy neutrino mass differences are equal to the resonance widths , for initial vanishing abundance and in @xcite in the context of radiative leptogenesis @xcite with minimal flavor violation @xcite .",
    "we perform a general analysis in the degenerate limit ( dl ) , where at least one of the degeneracies @xmath18 .",
    "we show that in this case the strong wash - out regime always holds and the lower bound on @xmath8 can be expressed through @xmath19 and the quantity @xmath20 . in the most extreme case of resonant leptogenesis",
    "this turns both into a lower bound on @xmath1 and into an upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale that depend on each other . in this way we find that @xmath0-leptogenesis can indeed explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe in the strong wash - out regime and therefore , like leptogenesis from high - energy phases , exhibits the same virtue of independence of the initial conditions",
    "in section 2 we introduce the general framework and set the notation . in section 3",
    "we present the results in the hl .",
    "we confirm , in a more general way , the conclusions of @xcite , showing that the allowed region for @xmath0-leptogenesis is quite restricted , especially in the strong wash - out regime and considering that the asymmetry production has to switch off for @xmath21 , when the unflavored case is recovered and @xmath2 violation from low - energy phases turns off .",
    "we also verify that this conclusion holds even when the asymmetry production from the two heavier rh neutrinos is taken into account . on the other hand , we show that a @xmath14-dominated scenario can also be realized in @xmath0-leptogenesis .",
    "we conclude that one needs to go beyond the hl for successful @xmath0-leptogenesis in the strong wash - out regime and in any case not to be just marginally allowed .",
    "therefore , in section 4 we study the dl showing that successful @xmath0-leptogenesis is possible and we find a condition that relates @xmath19 to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and to @xmath25 .",
    "we also find an upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale dependent on @xmath3 that makes @xmath0-leptogenesis falsifiable independently of the rh neutrino spectrum .",
    "in section 5 we draw the conclusions .",
    "adding to the standard model three rh neutrinos with a majorana mass term @xmath26 and yukawa couplings @xmath27 , after spontaneous breaking a dirac mass term , @xmath28 , is generated by the vev @xmath29 of the higgs boson . in the see - saw limit ,",
    "@xmath30 , the spectrum of neutrino mass eigenstates splits in two sets , a very heavy one , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with masses respectively @xmath33 and almost coinciding with the eigenvalues of @xmath26 , and a light one , with masses @xmath34 corresponding to the eigenvalues of the light neutrino mass matrix given by the see - saw formula @xcite , m_= - m_d 1 m m_d^t .",
    "neutrino mixing experiments measure two light neutrino mass squared differences . in a normal scheme one has @xmath35 and @xmath36 , whereas in an inverted scheme one has @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for @xmath39 @xcite",
    "the spectrum is quasi - degenerate , while for @xmath40 @xcite is fully hierarchical .    in the early universe ,",
    "the decays of the heavy neutrinos into leptons and higgs bosons produce , in general , a lepton number that is partly converted into a baryon number by sphaleron ( @xmath4 conserving ) processes if the temperature is higher than about @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "an important role is played by the decay parameters of the heavy neutrinos defined as @xmath42 , the ratios of the decay widths to the expansion rate when the rh neutrinos start to become non - relativistic at @xmath43 . for @xmath44 the bulk of the @xmath45 decays occurs when they are non - relativistic and the inverse decays are not effective anymore . in this case all decays occur out - of - equilibrium and the wash - out of the asymmetry is weak . on the other hand , for @xmath46 ,",
    "the heavy neutrinos decays are balanced by inverse processes . in this case",
    "the heavy neutrino abundance tracks quite closely the equilibrium abundance and the wash - out of the asymmetry is potentially , but not necessarily , strong .",
    "the answer depends on a detailed description of flavor effects that are triggered by the charged lepton yukawa interactions with a rate @xmath47  @xcite , where the @xmath48 s are the charged lepton yukawa couplings in the diagonal basis .",
    "if @xmath49 , is different by that lepton produced by the decay of a rh neutrino @xmath50 and therefore is not in general fully absorbed by the @xmath50 inverse decay @xcite . ] during all the relevant period of the asymmetry generation , then the lepton state coherence is preserved between decays and inverse decays and the unflavored regime , where flavor effects are negligible , holds .",
    "this requirement implies @xcite [ unflavored ] m_1510 ^ 11gev . in the unflavored regime",
    "the condition @xmath46 is also sufficient for the wash - out regime to be strong .",
    "it is important to stress that in this regime the only source of @xmath2 violation is due to a different total decay rate into leptons and anti - leptons and , as it is well known , it stems uniquely from high - energy phases .",
    "therefore , in the unflavored regime , @xmath0-leptogenesis is not viable .    if the charged lepton yukawa interactions are in equilibrium ( @xmath51 ) and faster than inverse decays , [ condition ] _",
    "_ i_id^i , during the relevant period of the asymmetry generation , then the lepton quantum states lose coherence between the production at decay and the subsequent absorption in inverse processes . in this way",
    "the higgs bosons interact incoherently with leptons of each flavor . in the limit case ,",
    "when the quantum state becomes completely incoherent and is fully projected in one of the flavor eigenstates , each lepton flavor can be treated as a statistically independent particle species and a ` fully flavored regime ' is obtained .",
    "one has to distinguish a two - flavor regime , for @xmath52 , such that the condition eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) is in any case satisfied only for @xmath53 , and a three - flavor regime , where the condition eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) applies also to @xmath54 .    in the fully ( two or three ) flavored regime",
    ", classic boltzmann equations can be used like in the unflavored regime , with the difference , in general , that now each single flavor asymmetry has to be tracked independently .    in the fully flavored regime",
    "there are two new effects compared to the unflavored regime @xcite .",
    "these can be understood introducing the projectors and writing them as the sum of two terms , p_i & & |l_i|l_|^2 = p_i^0 + p_i2 +    of the wash - out compared to the unflavored regime and is described by the tree level contribution @xmath55 setting the fraction of the total asymmetry , produced in @xmath45-decays , that goes into each single flavor @xmath56 . in the fully flavored regime , each single inverse decay involves an independent lepton flavor eigenstate and therefore does not wash out , in general , as much asymmetry as that one produced in each single decay but an amount reduced by @xmath57 .",
    "the second effect is an additional @xmath2 violating contribution coming from a different flavor composition between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this can be described in terms of the projector differences @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 . indeed , defining the flavored @xmath2 asymmetries , _",

    "i=_ip^0_i+ p_i2 , where @xmath64 are the total @xmath2 asymmetries . in the last expression one can see that the first term is the usual contribution due to a different decay rate into lepton and anti - leptons and the second is the additional contribution due to a possible different flavor composition between @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ".    taking into account only decays and inverse decays with proper subtraction of the resonant contribution from @xmath65 and @xmath66 processes @xcite , the set of effective classic boltzmann equations valid in the fully three - flavored regime can be written as [ flke ] dn_n_idz & = & -d_i(n_n_i - n_n_i^eq ) ( i=1,2,3 ) + & = & _ i_id_i(n_n_i - n_n_i^eq ) -_ip_i^0 w_i^idn _ _ ( = e , , ) , where @xmath67 and where we indicated with @xmath68 any particle number or asymmetry @xmath69 calculated in a portion of co - moving volume containing one heavy neutrino in ultra - relativistic thermal equilibrium , so that @xmath70 . defining @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,",

    "this conclusion changes when non - vanishing @xmath125 are considered . in this case",

    "it should also be said that , as shown in @xcite , the applicability of the one - flavor dominated scenario is strongly limited by the condition of validity of the fully flavored regime eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) .",
    "the _ second possibility _ relies on the observation that , contrarily to @xmath132 , the @xmath125 s depend on the low - energy phases as well and , even though @xmath133 , they do not vanish if the dirac or the majorana phases do not vanish .",
    "therefore , one can have a final asymmetry originating just from low - energy phases @xcite .",
    "this scenario represents , potentially , the most important novelty introduced by flavor effects compared to the unflavored picture and in the following sections we will study it in detail , focusing on the case of @xmath0-leptogenesis , when only the dirac phase is switched on while @xmath88 is real and the two majorana phases vanish .    before concluding this section , we want to notice that one can have @xmath134 not only when the see - saw orthogonal matrix is real , but also when the absolute neutrino mass scale increases @xcite . in this way",
    ", the low - energy phases can play an important role in circumventing the upper bound on the neutrino masses holding in the unflavored regime @xcite .",
    "it is however still to be assessed whether the fully flavored regime can offer a sufficient description to solve this issue . in @xcite",
    "the bound was found to be completely nullified by flavor effects .",
    "in @xcite it has been pointed out how this conclusion relies on a extension of the fully flavored regime beyond the regime of its validity given by the eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors find that in the fully flavored regime , thanks to spectator processes , the bound holding in the unflavored regime , even though not nullified , is anyway relaxed to @xmath135 .",
    "let us consider first @xmath0-leptogenesis in the hl , such that @xmath136 @xcite . in the unflavored regime , this assumption typically implies a @xmath6-dominated scenario , where the final asymmetry is dominated by the contribution from the lightest rh neutrino decays , [ n1ds ] n^f_b - l .",
    "n_b - l^f |_n_1 _",
    "indeed , in general , in the hl one has two effects .",

    "the second effect is a consequence of the fact that the total @xmath2 asymmetries vanish in the limit when all particles running in the loops become massless and this yields typically @xmath138 .",
    "however , for a particular choice of the see - saw parameters , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the contribution to the final asymmetry from the next - to - lightest rh neutrino @xmath14 is not only non - negligible but even dominant , giving rise to a @xmath14-dominated scenario @xcite .",
    "indeed for @xmath139 different things happen simultaneously .",
    "first , @xmath14 , even though decoupled from @xmath6 , is still coupled to @xmath32 and in the hl the total @xmath2 asymmetry @xmath141 does not vanish , since it receives a non suppressed contribution from graphs where @xmath32 runs in the loops . on the other hand ,",
    "now one has @xmath133 , since @xmath6 is essentially decoupled from the other two rh neutrinos . at the same time one also has @xmath142 , so that the wash - out from @xmath6 inverse processes is negligible .",
    "the final result is that @xmath143 and the final asymmetry is dominantly produced from @xmath14-decays .",
    "therefore , in the unflavored approximation and in the hl , a condition @xmath144 in the @xmath88-matrix parametrization ( cf .",
    "( [ second ] ) ) is sufficient to have a negligible asymmetry production from the two heavier rh neutrinos and to guarantee that the @xmath6-dominated scenario holds .",
    "this condition is even not necessary for @xmath145 , since in this case , due to the fact that @xmath146 , one has necessarily @xmath118 and a wash - out from @xmath6-inverse processes is anyway strong enough to suppress a possible contribution to the final asymmetry produced from @xmath14-decays .",
    "when flavor effects are taken into account , the domain of applicability of the @xmath6-dominated scenario reduces somehow .",
    "there are two aspects to be considered .",
    "the first aspect is that the wash - out from @xmath6 inverse processes becomes less efficient . indeed",
    "the projectors @xmath147 can considerably reduce the wash - out of the asymmetry produced in the flavor @xmath56 from @xmath14-decays @xcite .",
    "this turns the condition @xmath145 into a looser condition @xmath148 .",
    "another effect is that @xmath6 inverse processes can make part of the asymmetry produced in @xmath14 decays somehow orthogonal to the the wash - out from @xmath6 inverse processes @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been also pointed out that spectator processes can lead to a reduction of the wash - out from @xmath6-inverse processes as well @xcite . in this way",

    "it is now instructive to make some general considerations .",
    "looking at the expression eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) , one can see that , in order for the final @xmath4 asymmetry not to vanish , two conditions have to be simultaneously satisfied : @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "these two conditions are a specialization of the sakharov necessary conditions to the case of @xmath0-leptogenesis .",

    "it should also be noticed that the @xmath151 s are expressed through quantities @xmath189 $ ] , that are invariant under change of the pmns matrix parametrization @xcite .",

    "this wash - out avoidance does not apply to the asymmetry in the @xmath124 flavor .",

    "this assumption simplifies the calculation , since we do not have to describe a transition between the two and the three - flavor regime and because we can completely neglect the effect , envisaged in @xcite , for which part of the asymmetry produced from @xmath14-decays is not touched by @xmath6-inverse decays . indeed in a two - flavor regime ,",
    "even though in the hl we have found that this effect is negligible in all cases we considered because a @xmath124-dominance is always realized , in the dl it can become more relevant because the asymmetry is not necessarily produced dominantly in the @xmath124-flavor .    in order to go beyond the hl , it is convenient to introduce the quantities _ ji = -1 .",
    "we are interested in the degenerate limit ( dl ) , where at least one @xmath19 is small enough that both the asymmetry production from decays and the wash - out from inverse processes of the @xmath45 s and of the @xmath267 s can be approximately treated as if they occur at the same temperature , so that they can be simply added up .",

    "this upper bound will become more stringent if the experimental upper bound on @xmath3 will improve , as expected in future experiments in the case of no discovery .",
    "the most stringent experimental upper bound that can be hopefully reached in future with neutrino factories is approximately @xmath345 @xcite .",
    "this asymptotical upper bound is also shown in fig . 5 and",
    "would imply an upper bound @xmath346 for normal hierarchy and @xmath347 for inverted hierarchy .",
    "therefore , an interesting interplay between two measurable quantities is realized and this makes @xmath0-leptogenesis falsifiable independently of the rh neutrino mass spectrum .    in the more conservative case of normal hierarchy , see left panel of fig .  5 , a good approximation is given by the fit m_10.6 ( _ 13- 2.310 ^ -7 ) ^0.25 ev .",
    "it is interesting that this upper bound holds in the extreme case of resonant leptogenesis and therefore holds for any rh neutrino spectrum .",
    "however , we have to verify whether it holds also for a different choice of @xmath88 .",
    "the situation for @xmath155 is quite different compared to the previous cases .",

    "this time the contribution from the electron flavor vanishes .",
    "furthermore , for normal hierarchy , there is an almost perfect cancellation between the @xmath123 and the @xmath124 contribution . in the left panel of fig .",
    "6 we show the lower bound on @xmath3 versus @xmath264 and one can see how , compared to the previous case @xmath156 , this is much more restrictive .",
    "in particular , imposing @xmath350 , one obtains now a much more stringent upper bound @xmath351 . on the other hand , for inverted hierarchy , the cancellation between the @xmath123 and the @xmath323 flavor does not occur and one has a lower bound on @xmath3 , for @xmath352 , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "6 , that is very similar to what has been obtained in the case @xmath156 .",
    "however , now there is no flavor cancellation for increasing values of @xmath264 , because @xmath353 does not tend to a common value like @xmath354 .",
    "therefore , one can see in fig . 6",
    "that this time the upper bound on @xmath264 is much looser , both compared to normal hierarchy and compared to @xmath156 .    in the full dl , the flavor cancellation at large @xmath264 occurs and the results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "one can see how now for normal hierarchy the upper bound on @xmath264 is even much more restrictive and , for inverted hierarchy , one has a situation that is similar to the case @xmath156 .",
    "in this case the lightest rh neutrino decouples and @xmath249 , independently of @xmath8 . therefore , there is no contribution to the final asymmetry from @xmath6 decays . on the other hand @xmath153 and @xmath157 do not vanish and therefore there is a contribution from the decays of the two heavier rh neutrinos . still @xmath6 inverse processes have to be taken into account since they contribute to the wash - out .",
    "there are two different possibilities .    in a full dl",
    "the wash - out from @xmath6 inverse decays just cumulates with the wash - out from the two heavier .",
    "therefore , this time , in the expression eq .",

    "8 we show the dependence of the @xmath3 lower bound on @xmath264 . this time there is a bigger suppression than in the case @xmath156 , both for normal and for inverted hierarchy .",
    "in the case @xmath273 one has g(m_1,_32,_13 , ) & & 2k_atm(k_2+k_3)k_2k_3 ( m_3-m_2)m_atm^2 _32 + & & [ g32b ] _ ( k_2+k_3 ) e^-38k_1 im[u^_2u_3 ] .",
    "the dependence of the lower bound on @xmath3 on @xmath264 is shown in fig .",
    "9 for normal hierarchy . in this case",
    "the upper bound on @xmath264 is now slightly less stringent than in the previous cases .    for inverted hierarchy the final asymmetry production is so suppressed that there is no allowed region .",
    "we can conclude this section noticing that these results show that @xmath0-leptogenesis can be falsified . in the case of normal hierarchy ,",
    "the current upper bound @xmath357 implies @xmath358 , while , in future , a potential upper bound @xmath359 would imply @xmath360 , with a more precise determination depending on the possibility of improving the current estimation of the parameter @xmath307 in resonant leptogenesis .",
    "the most attractive feature of @xmath0-leptogenesis is that a non - vanishing dirac phase , the only see - saw phase that we can realistically hope to discover in future , acts as the only source of @xmath2 violation responsible for the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe . we think that this feature , despite of the objections that we are going to discuss , provides a strong motivation for @xmath0-leptogenesis .",
    "as we have seen , successful @xmath0-leptogenesis implies stringent conditions on the rh neutrino masses , something quite interesting since they escape conventional experimental information .",
    "in particular we have seen that , except for a marginal allowed region in the weak wash - out regime , the hl is non - viable .",
    "we also observed that a definite conclusion on the existence of such a marginal allowed region , requires a full quantum kinetic treatment but in any case corrections are expected to shrink this already quite restricted allowed region .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-leptogenesis motivates models with degenerate rh neutrino masses , with the most extreme limit represented by resonant leptogenesis . even in this extreme limit",
    "imposing successful @xmath0-leptogenesis , interesting conditions follow on quantities accessible in low - energy neutrino experiment : @xmath3 , the absolute neutrino mass scale , normal or inverted scheme , the dirac phase itself .",
    "therefore , an interesting aspect of @xmath0-leptogenesis is that it is falsifiable independently of the heavy neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "there are some objections to @xmath0-leptogenesis .",
    "there is no clear theoretical motivation for @xmath0-leptogenesis , more generally to choose a real orthogonal @xmath88 matrix .",
    "apparently , sequential dominated models @xcite could represent an interesting theoretical framework . indeed in @xcite it was shown that these models correspond to have an @xmath88 matrix that slightly deviates from the unit matrix or from all the other five that can be obtained from the unit matrix exchanging rows or columns .",
    "however , it has been noticed @xcite that in the limit @xmath361\\rightarrow 0 $ ] total @xmath2 asymmetries @xmath362 do not necessarily vanish .",
    "therefore , in this limit and taking vanishing majorana phases , one does not necessarily obtain @xmath0-leptogenesis .",
    "writing @xmath363 $ ] , the correct condition to enforce @xmath364 is to take the limit @xmath365 .",
    "this is a more demanding limit than @xmath361\\rightarrow 0 $ ] and it is currently not motivated by generic sequential dominated models .",
    "this limit is not motivated either by radiative leptogenesis @xcite within the context of the minimal flavor violation principle @xcite , as recently considered in @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no theoretical justification for @xmath0-leptogenesis at the moment .",
    "another possible objection to @xmath0-leptogenesis is that it can not be distinguished from the general scenario , where all phases are present , even if a non - vanishing dirac phase is discovered . indeed",
    "a dirac phase would give in this case a subdominant contribution .",
    "this objection is however related also to the first one . indeed , since a theoretical model motivating @xmath0-leptogenesis is required anyway",
    ", one can hope to find some specific prediction that makes the model testable and @xmath0-leptogenesis together with it .",
    "dirac phase leptogenesis would then become distinguishable from the general scenario , though in an indirect way .",
    "this last objection can be also considered within a more particular case where @xmath88 is still real but majorana phases are present together with the dirac phase .",
    "it has been noticed that the contribution to the final asymmetry from majorana phases is in general dominant compared to that one coming from the dirac phase @xcite . in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 we have compared the result on the @xmath8 lower bound for @xmath156 obtained in @xmath0-leptogenesis with the result when @xmath366=\\d=0 $ ] but @xmath367 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "one can see that in the second case the lower bound is @xmath368 times more relaxed .",
    "this result can be easily understood analytically @xcite and actually it can be also observed that there can be exact cancellations between the contribution to the final asymmetry from the majorana phases and from the dirac phase .",
    "the presence of cancellations can be somehow regarded as a limit to @xmath0-leptogenesis main motivation , since even though a dirac phase will be discovered , it is not guaranteed that the observed asymmetry can be explained .",
    "this objection is however quite weak since it would be quite strange if nature disposed a sufficient source of @xmath2 violation but set up a second source that exactly cancels with the first one while the observed asymmetry is , in the end , explained still by a third one , for example the phases in @xmath88 . on the other hand",
    ", we can say that it would be certainly positive for @xmath0-leptogenesis if in future experimental upper bounds on the majorana phases are placed , for example from @xmath369 decay , thus constraining the contribution to the final asymmetry from majorana phases @xcite .",
    "this can be also regarded as a further prediction coming from @xmath0-leptogenesis .    in conclusion , we have studied in detail a specific scenario of leptogenesis that is interesting especially in view of the many next planned experiments aiming at a discovery of @xmath2 violation in neutrino mixing . despite some important remarks and objections",
    ", we think that @xmath0-leptogenesis realizes a very interesting link between a long - standing cosmological puzzle and @xmath2 violation in neutrino oscillations , one of the most relevant experimental topics in high - energy physics during next years .    *",

    "<S> we discuss the conditions for a non - vanishing dirac phase @xmath0 and mixing angle @xmath1 , sources of @xmath2 violation in neutrino oscillations , to be uniquely responsible for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this scenario , that we call @xmath0-leptogenesis , is viable when the degenerate limit ( dl ) for the heavy right - handed ( rh ) neutrino spectrum is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an interesting joint condition on @xmath3 and the absolute neutrino mass scale that can be tested in future neutrino oscillation experiments . in the limit of hierarchical heavy rh neutrino spectrum ( hl ) , </S>",
    "<S> we strengthen the previous result that @xmath0-leptogenesis is only very marginally allowed , even when the production from the two heavier rh neutrinos is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> an improved experimental upper bound on @xmath3 and ( or ) an account of quantum kinetic effects could completely rule out this option in the future . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath0-leptogenesis can be also regarded as a motivation for models with degenerate heavy neutrino spectrum .    </S>",
