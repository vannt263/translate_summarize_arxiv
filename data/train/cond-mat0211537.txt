    "while the computer simulation of single , isolated polymer chains , either on or off lattice , using a variety of conformation sampling algorithms , is nowadays relatively routine , for up to @xmath0 monomers or segments @xcite , it is computationally much more demanding to simulate polymer solutions or melts , involving large numbers of interacting polymer chains . indeed",
    ", if @xmath1 is the number of such chains and @xmath2 the number of segments per polymer , then the total number of interacting particles , @xmath3 , can become very large , particularly so if @xmath2 is sufficiently large for the scaling regime to be reached @xcite . under these conditions",
    "it is tempting to seek a coarse - graining procedure to reduce the full segment - level description to a model involving only the center of mass ( cm ) or the central monomer of each chain , thus reducing the initial @xmath3-body problem to a @xmath1-body problem .",
    "this is formally achieved by tracing out the individual monomer degrees of freedom , i.e. by averaging over polymer conformations for fixed positions of the cm s or central monomers of interacting polymer coils , taking into account the appropriate boltzmann weights .",
    "this idea goes back to flory and krigbaum @xcite .",
    "they predicted that the effective repulsive interaction between the cm s of linear self - avoiding walk ( saw ) polymers should diverge with molecular weight at full overlap , i.e. when the cm s of the two coils coincide .",
    "it was first realized by grosberg _",
    "_ @xcite that in fact the pair potential between cm s remains finite in the scaling limit @xmath4 , and of the order of a few @xmath5 , reflecting the purely entropic origin of the effective interaction .",
    "the effective cm pair potential between two isolated saw polymer coils was explicitly evaluated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of on and off - lattice models @xcite , and by renormalization group ( rg ) calculations @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the effective pair potential is purely repulsive , with an overlap ( zero separation ) value of about @xmath6 and a range of the order of the radius of gyration @xmath7 .",
    "the zero concentration pair potential is reasonably well represented by a single gaussian of width @xmath7 .",
    "more recently the effective pair potential was determined at _ finite _ polymer concentration by a combination of monomer - level mc simulations of lattice saw polymers , and an inversion technique based on integral equations for pair distribution functions in simple liquids @xcite .",
    "the resulting pair potentials depend now moderately on polymer concentration @xcite , but they remain essentially repulsive and of range @xmath7 . they have been put to good use to reproduce the interfacial tension of semi - dilute polymer solutions near hard walls or colloidal spheres @xcite , and to determine the depletion interaction between colloidal particles induced by interacting ( rather than ideal ) polymer coils @xcite and the resulting , depletion - induced phase diagram of colloidal dispersions @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports an extension of the above inversion strategy to the case of dilute and semi - dilute solutions of interacting linear polymers in solvents of variable quality , spanning the range between good solvent conditions , modeled by the saw , and poor solvent conditions , where the coils contract to avoid contact with the solvent .",
    "this generalization is achieved by adding a finite attractive interaction between nearest - neighbor monomers of the same or different chains , while maintaining infinite repulsion between overlapping monomers .",
    "the finite nearest - neighbor attraction introduces an energy scale , and hence a temperature dependence of the effective pair potential .",
    "good solvent conditions correspond to the infinite temperature limit , leading back to the saw model considered earlier , while increasingly poor solvent conditions are mimicked by enhancing the attraction between monomers , or equivalently , decreasing the temperature .",
    "the dependence of the properties of a single polymer coil , like its radius of gyration @xmath7 , on temperature , and in particular around and below the @xmath8 temperature where the coil to globule transition takes place , has been studied by extensive mc simulations of very long chains ( @xmath2 up to @xmath9 ) by grassberger and collaborators @xcite .",
    "results for the temperature dependence of the effective pair potential for an off - lattice model of two polymer coils ( i.e. in the infinite dilution limit ) were reported by dautenhahn and hall @xcite . these authors met with increasing mc sampling difficulties as the temperature is decreased towards the @xmath8 point .",
    "the present paper improves on their results by considering a lattice model , and using an overlapping distribution method @xcite to sample rare conformations which become increasingly important as the temperature decreases .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to consider , for the first time , the effective pair potential between the cm s of polymer coils in poor solvent at _ finite _ polymer concentration , i.e. to investigate both the temperature and concentration dependence of the cm pair potential , in particular in the vicinity of the @xmath8 point . the polymer model studied in this work",
    "is defined in section [ model ] .",
    "the zero concentration limit is first considered in section [ zerodens ] , while finite polymer concentrations are examined next in section [ finitedens ] .",
    "some considerations on the use of effective interactions in relation to thermodynamic stability are presented in section [ stability ] , and conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "for all the calculations in the present work , a lattice model defined on the simple cubic lattice ( with a coordination number of six ) was used @xcite .",
    "a polymer chain of length @xmath2 is represented as a connected sequence of @xmath2 lattice sites .",
    "the monomers , defined as occupied sites , interact with each other via excluded volume repulsion , preventing two of them from occupying the same lattice position , and lattice nearest - neighbor attraction @xmath10 between non - bonded pairs of monomers . for convenience , the temperature @xmath11 will be expressed in units of @xmath12 , or equivalently we will set @xmath13 and @xmath14 . with this convention , the usual @xmath15 appearing in the boltzmann factor is simply the inverse of the temperature , i.e. @xmath16 . in the following , we shall call `` contact '' any nearest - neighbor pair of non - bonded monomers .",
    "we use `` intramolecular '' if both monomers belong the same chain , and `` intermolecular '' otherwise . when a system consisting of @xmath1 chains of @xmath2 segments is considered on a portion of cubic lattice of @xmath17 sites ,",

    "this simple model has been extensively studied in order to investigate the properties of isolated polymer chains and of polymer solutions . in the phenomenology of these systems ,",

    "an isolated chain takes swollen coil configurations with a radius of gyration @xmath7 known to scale as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the flory exponent in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "this regime has been extensively studied in the case of the saw to which the present model reduces in the infinite temperature limit @xcite .    in the bad or poor solvent regime , corresponding here to low temperatures , entropic effects are overwhelmed by the attractive monomer - monomer interactions and a chain molecule collapses into a compact globule with a radius of gyration scaling like @xmath26 .    between these two extremes",
    "lies the @xmath8 regime , where energetic and entropic effects compensate each other . in this regime , in the limit of infinite length , a chain has the scaling properties of an ideal chain , for instance @xmath27 .",
    "the characterization of this domain has been the focus of many studies using the present lattice model @xcite , with in particular extensive work by grassberger and coworkers @xcite .    of key importance",
    "is the so - called @xmath8 temperature , @xmath20 , at which the tricritical coil - to - globule transition takes place for an isolated chain in the @xmath4 limit .",
    "it corresponds to a real thermodynamic singularity and its best estimate is presently @xcite @xmath28 obviously , simulations can only deal with chains of finite length , for which the tricritical singularity is rounded off by significant finite size corrections .",
    "@xmath20 is thus not directly accessible and it is common practice , in simulations as well as in experiments , to obtain it by extrapolation of related , length - dependent characteristic temperatures .",
    "the most widely used of such temperatures is boyle s temperature , @xmath29 , defined as the temperature at which the osmotic second virial coefficient of chains of length @xmath2 vanishes . from its knowledge , one can compute the @xmath8 temperature from the limit @xmath30 this route has been followed in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that @xmath29 is always greater than @xmath20 and decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "an alternative possibility is to use the demixing critical temperature of the polymer solution .",
    "this marks the limit between a high temperature regime where the chains in solution form a homogeneous fluid , and a low temperature domain where the chains start to coagulate and the fluid demixes into polymer - rich and polymer - poor phases . in the lattice model used here , where the solvent is taken into account implicitly through the introduction of constant attractive monomer - monomer interactions and variations of the temperature ,",
    "it is simply the critical temperature @xmath31 of the liquid - gas transition of the system . as for @xmath29 , one has @xmath32 and it has been found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that @xmath33 is always smaller than @xmath20 and increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we anticipate on the following sections and introduce here a third characteristic temperature called the `` stability '' temperature and denoted @xmath34 .",
    "it is associated with a fundamental breakdown in the statistical - mechanical treatment of the coarse - grained effective pair interaction @xmath35 between the cm s of two polymer chains at low temperature .",
    "singularities of a similar nature have been encountered in various models for soft matter systems .",
    "for instance , baxter s sticky sphere model @xcite displays anomalous clustering towards a closed - packed crystalline phase as a result of breakdown of thermodynamic stability @xcite . in the case of polymers ,",
    "the domb - joyce model @xcite shows self - trapping behavior , i.e. a chain remains of finite extent in the infinite length limit , when a negative energy is attributed to self - crossings @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath34 and the @xmath8 point is unclear .",
    "for any length @xmath2 , @xmath34 will be shown to be smaller than @xmath29 , the equality being only achieved when the pair interaction is zero .",
    "for the specific length @xmath36 studied in detail in this paper , it is found to fall between @xmath29 and @xmath20 . because it corresponds to a singularity in the statistical - mechanical treatment of the system , it is tempting to assume , as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath37 and fig .",
    "[ sketch ] has been drawn under this assumption .",
    "interestingly , this would imply that , in the infinite length limit , since @xmath38 , the effective interaction between two isolated polymer chains at the @xmath8 point vanishes identically for all distances , a behavior which is trivially found in the case of the domb - joyce model @xcite , when a positive constant energy penalty is counted for each polymer crossing ( note that in this model , the temperature scale is reversed since the saw is obtained at zero temperature and ideal chain behavior is found at infinite temperature ) .",
    "in the zero density limit , the effective interaction potential @xmath35 between two polymer chains is equal to the difference between the free energy of the two chains with their centers of mass constrained to stay at a fixed distance @xmath39 , and the free energy of the same chains infinitely far apart .",
    "it can be expressed as follows .",
    "consider two polymer chains labeled @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "when these chains have conformations @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , with the vector @xmath44 joining their centers of mass , the energy of the pair is @xmath45 where the intra- and intermolecular parts ( including the hard - core interactions ) have been separated . introducing the intermolecular boltzmann weight @xmath46,\\ ] ] the effective pair potential",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath47 where the brackets denote an average over the probability distribution of two isolated chains , which is the square of the probability distribution @xmath48 of a single chain , i.e. @xmath49 with @xmath50\\left/ \\sum_\\gamma \\exp\\left[-\\beta\\,h_{\\text{intra}}(\\gamma)\\right]\\right .. \\ ] ]    this result provides us with a direct means to compute the effective pair potential between two chains by monte carlo simulations .",
    "we sample configurations of two independent chains using the pivot algorithm @xcite and standard metropolis acceptance rules .",
    "the latter ensure that the chain conformations are generated according to the probability distribution @xmath48 .",
    "after every 1000 pivot moves for each chain , we calculate the intermolecular boltzmann weight as a function of the cm distance , by moving the polymers towards each other , while checking for overlap and counting intermolecular contacts .",
    "eventually , @xmath51 is obtained by performing the unweighted average of @xmath52 on the sample considered : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of two chain configurations with cm s at distance @xmath39 sampled during the simulation .    using this algorithm ,",
    "we have been able to compute with good statistical accuracy effective pair potentials for various chain lengths ( @xmath36 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , provided @xmath57 .",
    "unfortunately , this simple , direct method turns out to be inadequate at lower temperatures , where the results for the effective potential at short distances are found to fluctuate strongly with the sample considered , with no significant reduction of the corresponding statistical uncertainties when the size of this sample is increased .",
    "the origin of this problem , already seen in the analogous off - lattice calculation of dautenhahn and hall @xcite , has been carefully analyzed by grassberger and hegger in their calculation of the second virial coefficient of the same lattice model as the one studied here @xcite . at low temperature , the polymer chains start to collapse significantly and are thus rather compact .",
    "this means that at short distances , most two - chain configurations obtained with the present direct algorithm will overlap and the corresponding intermolecular boltzmann weights are then identically zero .",
    "but , in the rare cases where the two chains do not overlap , many contacts will usually be formed , leading to very low negative intermolecular energies and thus huge intermolecular boltzmann weights contributing to the pair potential .",
    "the need to average such unevenly distributed numbers of very different amplitudes gives rise to the large observed fluctuations and renders the direct approach useless .",
    "hence more elaborate algorithms must be used for low temperatures . in order to choose these new tools , it is helpful to recognize the strong similarity between the previous scheme and widom s particle insertion method for the computation of the chemical potential @xcite",
    ". both methods indeed involve the averaging of a boltzmann weight over the equilibrium distribution of some unperturbed system , and in fact the observed breakdown of the direct calculation of the effective pair potential at low temperature parallels that of widom s method at high fluid densities . in the latter case ,",
    "an efficient approach to solve the problem has been devised by shing and gubbins @xcite , which belongs to the general class of overlapping distribution methods first introduced by bennett to compute free - energy differences @xcite .",
    "we have thus implemented such a method which is described in detail in the appendix .    using this histogram method ,",
    "we have been able to extend our calculation of the effective pair potentials between chains of length @xmath36 to lower temperatures , i.e. up to @xmath58 .",
    "however , the method breaks down when applied to longer chains , for mainly two reasons .",
    "firstly , the acceptance ratio of the elementary monte carlo move becomes extremely small , leading to serious ergodicity problems in the simulations .",
    "secondly , except for small separations corresponding to nearly complete overlap of the chains , the two computed histograms do not overlap at all , rendering the estimation of the required free energy difference quite problematic .",
    "the origin of this problem can easily be understood on a qualitative level . in the original system ,",
    "the chains attract each other strongly and lower their intermolecular energy at low temperature by elongating towards each other along the axis joining their cm s : there is thus a sizeable volume where the two chains overlap with the consequent formation of contacts in large numbers @xcite . on the contrary , in the reference system , only unfavorable excluded volume interactions exist between the two partly collapsed chains which are thus compressed along the axis joining their cm s to limit their overlap @xcite : contacts are then formed in small numbers only at the surface separating the two segregated chains .",
    "this significant separation in the number of contacts does not occur ( or at least is less pronounced for the lengths studied here ) at complete overlap because the system has then to keep the spherical symmetry of the isolated chains , thus leaving no possibility for the adverse changes of the chain shapes seen in the cylindrical symmetry .",
    "although it would be possible to use alternative methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) to sample even longer chains at low temperature , we use mainly @xmath36 chains in this paper , since we do not expect the qualitative features we focus on here to depend strongly on chain length @xcite .",
    "of course , quantitative features will vary with @xmath2 , and the detailed scaling behavior can be quite complex @xcite .",
    "the effective pair interactions @xmath59 between two polymers of length @xmath36 are plotted , for various solvent qualities , in fig .",
    "[ direct ] .",
    "the product of the potential by @xmath60 is shown as well , because the integral of this quantity plays an important role for the thermodynamics of the system @xcite , and to emphasize the features of the potential at large distances . in this figure and in all the following figures representing effective pair potentials ,",
    "all distances have been scaled at each temperature by the radius of gyration of the isolated chain at this temperature , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ rgzero ] for completeness .",
    "radii of gyration of isolated polymer chains of different lengths @xmath2 on the simple cubic lattice as functions of the inverse temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the data are scaled with the infinite temperature values , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . ]",
    "one can distinguish two temperature domains . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the infinite temperature limit of the model was studied , @xmath59 was found to be purely repulsive with a roughly gaussian shape centered on @xmath64 .",
    "here we find that it remains so , provided the temperature is high enough , i.e. @xmath65 . the main effect of lowering the temperature is a reduction of the overall amplitude of the potential and a slight decrease in its range in terms of the normalized distance .    at lower temperatures , @xmath66 ,",
    "@xmath59 begins to exhibit qualitative changes : while the potential retains a repulsive gaussian - like component at short distance , a negative , attractive tail appears at large distance .",
    "as the temperature decreases further , the amplitude of the repulsive core decreases , following the trend of the previous high temperature domain , whereas the attractive tail becomes more and more important , ultimately dominating the whole picture , as seen for @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is everywhere negative and only a modest repulsion shows up for @xmath67 .    a second , less prominent",
    "feature appears at low temperature ( @xmath68 ) as well . at @xmath64 , the effective pair",
    "potential displays a small minimum , which becomes deeper when the temperature decreases .",
    "this means that full overlap is locally stable and that one has to overcome a ( modest ) free - energy barrier to separate two chains in this configuration . for chains of length @xmath36 ,",
    "it is difficult to know if this feature is a generic property of the effective pair potential or just a lattice artifact due to the shortness of the chains ( the width of the minimum is indeed of the order of the lattice spacing ) . however , despite our limited ability to investigate longer chains at low temperature , we have seen evidence of a similar minimum , but of larger width , for chains of length @xmath69 at @xmath70 , suggesting that this is a genuine physical effect .",

    "in addition , we introduce the `` stability '' integral , @xmath72 which results from the linearization of the exponential in eq .  .",

    "accordingly , as discussed by anticipation in sec .",

    "at each temperature , the @xmath84-axis is scaled with the corresponding @xmath85 . ]    finally , we address the question of the dependence of the zero density effective pair potential on the chain length . in ref .",

    "such an extensive study was not attempted here and we only considered two rather short lengths ( @xmath87 and @xmath56 ) in addition to the previous data for @xmath36 .",
    "all these data , plotted in fig .  [ length ] with the one previously described , have been computed with the direct method , leading to strong statistical uncertainties at the lowest temperature corresponding to @xmath58 .    to interpret these potentials one should keep in mind that @xmath7 scales differently with temperature for the different lengths , as illustrated in fig .",

    ", are consistent with the findings of grassberger and hegger for the variation of the reduced second osmotic virial coefficient , @xmath77 , with temperature for various lengths ( see fig .  16 in ref .",

    "@xcite , with the only minor difference that we do not see a decrease of the amplitude of the potential at short distances for the highest concentrations .",
    "the situation is completely different when @xmath58 ( fig .  [ dens3 ] ) . here",
    "the density dependence of the effective pair potential is very important and leads to significant qualitative changes in the shape of the potential : whereas at low density , @xmath103 is negative and essentially attractive , repulsion between centers of mass progressively builds up when the density increases , so that an almost purely repulsive , gaussian shaped @xmath103 is eventually observed at the largest density . for the good solvent case a clear link has been found between the density dependence and the strength of the 3- and higher body interactions @xcite . presuming that the same link can be made here",
    ", this would imply that the many - body interactions are relatively more important at lower temperatures .",
    "the virial coefficient has no clear interpretation for potentials obtained at finite global densities , whereas the `` stability '' integral does still define a lower limit to the existence of a thermodynamic limit of the coarse - grained system . as can be directly seen from fig .",
    "[ dens3]b , at all densities , except the largest ( @xmath127 ) , the stability integral of the computed potentials is negative , leading to serious consistency issues to be discussed in the next section .",
    "the potentials computed in this work raise a number of interesting conceptual issues with regard to the use of effective potentials in coarse - grained descriptions of material properties .",
    "the first question concerns _ thermodynamic stability _",
    "@xcite : do the calculated pair potentials generate a valid thermodynamic limit ? secondly , there is a question of _ representability _ @xcite : for a given state point , how well can the properties of the underlying polymer system be coherently represented by a single coarse - grained effective pair potential ?",
    "we briefly repeat the criteria for the existence of a thermodynamic limit described in ruelle s classic book @xcite and valid for state independent interactions .",
    "consider a system of @xmath1 particles in a volume @xmath128 . if the total interaction energy @xmath129 , which can be built from pair and higher order terms , satisfies , for all @xmath130 and for all configurations @xmath131 in the configuration space @xmath132 , the inequality @xmath133 with @xmath134 , then , according to definition @xmath135 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the system is _ stable _ : the grand partition function converges , and there is a well - defined thermodynamic limit .",
    "potentials that do not satisfy this criterion are termed _ catastrophic _ by ruelle .",
    "specializing to pair potentials , i.e. @xmath136 condition   leads to the following necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the existence of a thermodynamic limit : @xmath137 which , following eq .  , can be rewritten @xmath138 , hence the name `` stability '' integral for @xmath73 . if eq .",
    "is not satisfied , then condition   can be violated for configurations of a homogeneous fluid .",
    "as @xmath139 , the free energy grows super - extensively  the system has no thermodynamic limit  and particles coalesce to form a dense cluster .",
    "condition   is necessary , but not sufficient , for the existence of a thermodynamic limit , since one can also construct potentials for which @xmath140 , but where the system in a microscopically inhomogeneous ( typically , crystalline ) state is unstable to coalescence .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for explicit examples .",
    "effective potentials with hard cores , such as those used to describe simple atomic and molecular materials , can be easily shown to satisfy the criterion  .",
    "in contrast , the potentials describing the effective interactions between the cm s of polymers studied in the present work do not have a hard core , leading to the possibility that two or more `` effective '' particles occupy the same position in space .",
    "the existence of a thermodynamic limit , where the free energy per particle is bounded , is therefore much more subtle .",
    "although the potentials calculated in this work are state dependent and technically only relevant at the density for which they have been obtained , it is nevertheless interesting to consider what would happen should one of them be used , independently of the density , to describe a system of @xmath141 particles in a volume @xmath128 . to this end , we first consider the zero density potentials shown in fig .",
    "[ direct ] .",
    "when the underlying saw polymer system has no nearest - neighbor monomer attractions , the effective pair potentials were shown to be positive @xcite , so that the criterion is obeyed . however , as fig .",
    "[ direct ] demonstrates , the introduction of nearest - neighbor attractions leads to effective potentials which are no longer positive definite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the potential grows more and more attractive , until finally it violates the ruelle criterion and becomes catastrophic .",
    "this can be diagnosed in fig .",
    "[ vir ] , where @xmath73 becomes negative at low temperature and the necessary condition is thus violated . in principle , the stability limit of the system should be traced by looking for a state point at which the potential leads to coalescence into microscopically inhomogeneous states , a rather difficult task in general . here",
    "we will use a simpler , approximate criterion , namely eq .",
    ", which is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for stability .",
    "we will make the heuristic assumption that the true stability limit is not far removed from the simpler one we employ @xcite . for a given potential then , eq .",
    "allows us to define the `` stability '' temperature @xmath22 below which the effective pair potential becomes catastrophic .",
    "this explains our nomenclature in secs .",
    "[ model ] and [ zerodens ] .",
    "the potentials derived at zero density violate eq .",
    "below a temperature @xmath142 ; the potentials are expected to become unstable to inhomogeneous coalescence at some temperature above that .",
    "if one were to use potentials derived for @xmath143 at a finite density , the system would be catastrophic .",
    "this naturally leads to the next question : what about the potentials we derived at finite density ? there , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dens3 ] , the pair potential can also violate eq .",
    ", even though the underlying polymer system is stable , both to coalescence and phase separation , since @xmath144 for our @xmath36 saw lattice chains . for large enough densities @xmath125 ,",
    "the potentials again satisfy eq .  .",
    "serious difficulties are thus emerging with the present coarse - graining procedure : in certain portions of the temperature - density plane , we replace a complex , but perfectly well - behaved , polymer system by a simple soft colloid fluid with pathological thermodynamics !",
    "this also raises a certain number of formal concerns .",
    "the first one is about the unicity of the mapping between @xmath101 and @xmath103 invoked in sec .",
    "[ finitedens ] and demonstrated in ref .",
    "the theorems rely on well - defined statistical ensembles and their derivations are no longer valid when a catastrophic potential is the outcome of their application .",
    "similarly , the lack of a well defined ensemble also leads to questions about the validity of the liquid state theory , including the ornstein - zernike equation , etc .",
    "however , in spite of these formal difficulties , one could take a purely pragmatic attitude : since it is numerically possible to extract effective pair potentials using the proposed procedure , why not just ignore all the previous concerns and see if these potentials can be of any practical use ? to investigate this point , mc simulations of a soft colloid system interacting through the catastrophic effective pair potential obtained for polymers at @xmath58 and @xmath110 were performed , revealing a very interesting behavior .",
    "we indeed find that the behavior of the soft colloid fluid depends strongly on the configuration from which the simulation is initiated .",
    "when an initial configuration is set up with all soft particles gathered in a single dense cluster , the system coalesces : the particles stay together indefinitely ( after a few million mc steps per particle , not a single one has been seen to escape the cluster ) , and the potential energy per particle @xmath145 appears unbounded , increasing in absolute value with increasing @xmath1 ; more precisely , we find @xmath146 for @xmath108 and @xmath147 for @xmath109 , which would give @xmath148 .",
    "this is exactly the type of behavior expected from a system interacting through a catastrophic potential .",
    "the structure of the clusters also shows distinctive features , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] , where pair distribution functions @xmath149 are plotted for the previous cluster sizes . for @xmath109 , @xmath149 displays three peaks , located at @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 . quite evidently ,",
    "the first two peaks originate in the formation of groups of superimposed particles separated by the distance corresponding to the interaction potential minimum .",
    "this is indeed a very efficient way for the system to lower its energy , since the energy cost for overlapping particles is modest compared to the stabilization of pairs of particles at distance @xmath153 .",
    "as for the third peak , it is very likely it has to be associated with the position of the second nearest neighbors . in comparison , for @xmath108 , @xmath149 is rather featureless and longer - ranged .",
    "this change in shape of @xmath149 is again easily understood from the clustering mechanism . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "smaller groups of superimposed particles can be formed , creating less deep energy wells at distance @xmath153 ; the resulting clusters are thus more diffuse and less structured than for large @xmath1 .",
    "pair distribution functions of two collapsed soft colloid systems , with @xmath108 and @xmath109 particles respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the space integral of @xmath149 has been normalized to 1 to allow a more significant comparison .",
    "the interaction potential is the effective pair potential obtained for a polymer system at @xmath58 and @xmath110 . ]",
    "but , if the initial conditions correspond to a homogeneous distribution of particles in the simulation box , the fluid is found to remain homogeneous over the entire time of our simulations ( up to @xmath154 mc steps per particle for 400 particles ) , suggesting that the homogeneous fluid is metastable with respect to catastrophic coalescence .",
    "in this case , the potential energy per particle @xmath145 is , as expected , independent of the size of the system , i.e. @xmath155 for systems containing @xmath156 or @xmath157 particles .",
    "of course , the original polymer system , which is perfectly stable , does not show such a dependence of its behavior on the initial conditions .",
    "this can be easily checked by preparing an initial configuration consisting of a dense cluster of polymer chains : the cluster `` evaporates '' very rapidly , and the density becomes uniform again within a few thousand mc steps per chain only .    in fig .",
    "[ gr ] , we compare the @xmath101 of the metastable fluid phase of the catastrophic soft colloid system to the @xmath101 of the cm s of the underlying polymer system at @xmath110 and @xmath58 .",
    "the agreement is excellent !",
    "this suggests that the hnc closure used in the inversion procedure , a closure which has been shown to be very accurate for bounded stable potentials @xcite , still works , in spite of the fact that the potential it produces is catastrophic @xcite .",
    "the situation is akin to that of the percus - yevick solution for the structure of baxter s sticky sphere model @xcite , which is useful for describing hard colloidal systems with very short ranged attractive interactions in spite of the fact that the underlying model system is actually catastrophic @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the problem is most likely circumvented by the approximate character of the chosen closure .",

    "]      the considerations of the previous section , where the coarse - graining procedure led to catastrophic potentials , are examples of the more general problems of _ transferability _ and _ representability _ of effective potentials used to describe complex systems , issues discussed in more detail in a recent review @xcite .",
    "transferability problems occur when an effective potential derived at one state point is not applicable at a different state point .",
    "in essence all the derived effective potentials in this paper suffer from transferability problems , since they vary with density and with temperature .",
    "however , for high temperatures , the density dependence is not that strong , so that the transferability problems are not as important as they appear to be at lower temperatures .",
    "for example , the effective potentials in fig .",
    "[ dens3 ] vary much more rapidly with density , suggesting that one must be very careful in using a potential derived at one state point as an approximate one for another state point .",
    "representability problems occur when effective potentials derived to reproduce one physical property , do not easily describe another physical property @xcite .",
    "for example , one can calculate the ( unique ) pair potential @xmath158 that reproduces the homogeneous structure ( described by @xmath101 ) of a system interacting via a hamiltonian with pair and triplet interaction terms ( similarly to what was done in this paper ) .",
    "if the usual equations for the internal energy or the virial pressure , valid for normal pair potentials , are applied to @xmath158 , then the latter thermodynamic quantities are not correctly reproduced .",
    "this was pointed out many years ago in the context of simple fluids @xcite .",
    "the same representability problems were already found for the athermal polymer case @xcite .",
    "they are expected to be more pronounced when the density dependence is as prominent as in fig .",
    "[ dens3 ] .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in the previous section , even more vexing representability problems occur , because the derived effective potentials can lead to systems without a well - defined thermodynamic limit .",
    "the problems of transferability and representability are more important for inhomogeneous systems . for example",
    ", at any interface between two phases , it is not clear which potential should be used .",
    "similarly , for the temperature regime that leads to the catastrophic potentials of the previous section , the apparent metastability of the effective `` soft colloid '' system allows for the inversions to work for a homogeneous system , but this breaks down if the simulations are started with certain inhomogeneous initial conditions . using some measure of the local density may be a better path to follow . taking again the example of fig .",
    "[ dens3 ] , if one were to use a local density dependence , the effective system could be stable against collapse , as the potentials would become more repulsive for higher local densities .",
    "this would then more closely resemble the underlying polymer system .",
    "however , prescriptions for taking local density dependence into account which are both accurate and tractable are not yet well developed .",
    "a final issue not yet resolved is the possible role of volume terms  contributions to the free - energy which are independent of the particular cm configuration .",
    "their effects on phase behavior can be subtle ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and they may appear in certain coarse - graining schemes @xcite .",
    "for the case of polymers in a good solvent , they were shown to be negligible @xcite , but that may no longer be the case for poorer solvents .",
    "we have extended previous work on a coarse - grained description of polymer solutions in good solvent to increasingly poor solvent conditions by adding nearest - neighbor attractions to the initial lattice saw model , and gradually lowering the temperature . as in the earlier work @xcite ,",
    "an effective pair potential @xmath103 between the centers of mass of the linear polymer coils was extracted from the monte carlo generated cm - cm pair distribution function @xmath101 , using the hnc closure , which is known to be very accurate in the absence of any hard core repulsion . in the infinite dilution limit ,",
    "the effective pair potential @xmath35 is close to a gaussian - shaped repulsion , of amplitude @xmath159 , at high temperatures ( corresponding to the saw limit ) , but this amplitude decreases as the inverse temperature @xmath15 increases ; an attractive tail develops and at the lowest temperature investigated in our mc simulations , the effective pair potential is entirely attractive , signalling a tendency of the system to coalesce .    at these low temperatures , severe ergodicity problems arise in the mc simulations , and , in the zero density limit , an overlapping histogram method must be used to extract statistically significant results .",
    "the problem worsens with increasing polymer length @xmath2 , so that our simulations were mostly restricted to @xmath36 .",
    "increasing the polymer concentration at fixed temperature leads to a `` restabilization '' of the solution in the sense that the effective pair potential exhibits an increasingly repulsive component as the system is taken from the ultra - dilute to the semi - dilute regime . even at the lowest temperature investigated ( @xmath160 )",
    ", the effective pair potential reverts to an almost exclusively repulsive gaussian - like shape at @xmath127 ( which , for these polymers , is close to the melt regime ) .",
    "the occurrence of strongly attractive and significantly state - dependent effective pair potentials between polymer cm s raises the question of the thermodynamic stability of systems of particles interacting via such `` catastrophic '' potentials , and of the appropriateness of the coarse - graining procedure to describe solutions of interacting polymers , which are intrinsically stable , close to the @xmath8 temperature .",
    "the observation that the effective coarse - grained pair potential @xmath103 is capable of reproducing the @xmath101 ( derived from monomer scale simulations ) despite the catastrophic nature of the pair potential , points to the possible existence of metastable homogeneous states generated by these potentials .",
    "these metastable states appear to exhibit proper thermodynamic extensivity properties , and may be stabilized against ultimate coalescence by sufficiently high kinetic barriers .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the catastrophic effective pair potentials may still provide a useful coarse - graining tool to describe homogeneous states .",
    "strongly inhomogeneous states , generated by coalescence , lead to widely different local densities , and hence would require the use of effective pair potentials depending on the local density . the fact that the effective pair potential tends to become more repulsive at higher density might provide the stabilizing mechanism for the homogeneous state .",
    "we plan to extend the present work to examine polymer cm density profiles near interfaces , and to extract the osmotic equation of state of polymer solutions as a function of concentration and temperature .",
