    "one of the most remarkable properties of macroscopic quantum systems is the phenomenon of persistent flow . in a superconductor",
    ", persistent flow is electrical current without resistance : current in a loop of superconducting wire will flow essentially forever [ 1 ] . in a superfluid such as liquid helium below the lambda point ,",
    "the frictionless flow allows persistent circulation in a hollow toroid [ 2 - 3 ] .",
    "although the dynamics of superfluids follows quite directly from the simple assumption that the quantum field of the particles has a mean value which may be treated as a macroscopic variable [ 4 ] ( anderson mentioned that it is as legitimate to treat the quantum field amplitude as a macroscopic dynamical variable as it is the position of a solid body ; both represent a broken symmetry which , however , can not be conveniently repaired until one gets to the stage of quantizing and studying the quantum fluctuations of the macroscopic behavior of the system).to help researchers to easily understand the superfluidity in the ring - type geometry , in this short paper , we only consider the uniform flow around a circular wavy - rough ( thin ) annulus with the linear dimension of the cross section smaller than the mean radius ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the wavy - rough corrugations ( @xmath1 ) is presumed to be much smaller than the linear dimension of the cross section ( say , @xmath2 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 , cf .",
    "fig . 1 ; i.e. @xmath5 ) .",
    "let @xmath6 be a coordinate along the average ring of the wavy - rough thin annulus ( @xmath7 representing the angle variable ) . the explicit dependence on the two additional coordinates required to locate an atom within the cross section",
    "is neglected here for simplicity .",
    "the system of @xmath8 atoms can be described by a symmetric wave function @xmath9 of the @xmath8 variables @xmath10 together with the conjugate momenta @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction with the walls shall be neglected here so that the total momentum @xmath13 ( or the total angular momentum @xmath14 ) is a constant of the motion .",
    "we can obtain a solution @xmath15,\\ ] ] of the schrdinger equation @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath19 which only come from the kinetic energy @xmath20 . from above equations and/or mathematical expressions ,",
    "the substitution for @xmath21 into the schrdinger equation gives @xmath22 together with the total energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total mass of the system .",
    "note that it is customary to separate the motion of the center of gravity ( @xmath25 . thus , @xmath26 which is due to the relative motion of the atoms , is normally independent of the total momentum @xmath27",
    ". nevertheless @xmath21 should be single valued for superfluid systems and must return to the same value when an atom is brought around the ring to its original position .",
    "this means whenever @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 with @xmath30.\\ ] ] hence , @xmath26 depends upon @xmath27 in the superfluid state .",
    "however , as @xmath31 depends only on the differences of @xmath10 and then @xmath31 remains the same if all @xmath8 of them are increased by @xmath32 .",
    "this also requires that @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer .",
    "the latter confirms that the eigenvalue of the total angular momentum @xmath14 to be integer multiples of @xmath36 . with above reasoning",
    ", we also have , for the eigenvalue @xmath26 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 is periodic with @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , as a reverse rotation can not affect the energy @xmath40 , the same holds for @xmath26 so that @xmath26 is an even function of @xmath27 . to be explicit ,",
    "a stationary state of the system can be characterized by @xmath27 and an additional set of @xmath41 quantum numbers , say , @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue of the energy is then of the general form @xmath43 with @xmath44 a dependence of the energy on the total momentum through @xmath26 indicates a phase memory which , irrespective of its origin , extends around the whole thin wavy - rough annulus .",
    "we only consider the conditions at the absolute zero of temperature ( t=0 ) for simplicity .",
    "it means @xmath45 and the ground state of the system will be characterized also by ( the set of additional quantum numbers ) @xmath46 .",
    "now , @xmath47 represents the lowest value of the energy for a given @xmath27 and @xmath48 has a minimum at @xmath45 ( and this minimum is periodically repeated : @xmath49 ) .",
    "if we presume @xmath48 has a finite slope as @xmath50 from either side , then it can be illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "2 . similarly , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath51 also exhibits minima when @xmath27 is an integer multiple of @xmath39 with an absolute magnitude below a _ critical _",
    "value @xmath52 .",
    "next , we need to consider the interaction of the system with the ( container ) walls along ( with ) the ensuing equilibrium to understand the significance of these minima . after starting from an arbitrary initial state , equilibrium can be reached by transitions involving an exchange of momentum and energy . once the walls ( of the container )",
    "are held at zero temperature , the system will be brought to the lowest state and hence to a vanishing momentum ( if , as in normal cases , there are no other minima of @xmath53 ) .",
    "if , however , there are other minima the system can reach one of them through a rapid succession of transitions , each involving an energy loss accompanied by a small transfer of momentum to the walls . from this on , only those transitions could occur in which the energy further decreases with a momentum transfer comparable to or larger than the macroscopically large value @xmath39 .",
    "such transitions can thus be safely considered to be so highly rare as to cause a _ metastability _",
    "which , in effect , will let the system remain in a state with ( momentum ) @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is an integer ) .",
    "in view of the general definition of the drift velocity @xmath56 ( @xmath24 ) , the system therefore exhibits _ persistent flow _ with ( the drift velocity ) @xmath57 meanwhile the _ circulation _ defined by the line integral around the ring is @xmath58 . with this , above just confirms the quantization with the _ quantum of circulation _",
    "@xmath59 ( valid for @xmath60 ) .      from equation ( 7 )",
    "we are concerned , in fact , no longer with a minimum of @xmath53 at such large values of @xmath61 that @xmath62 rises more steeply than @xmath63 , because it allows a decrease of the energy towards the low - momentum side . using the derivatives expression and @xmath64",
    ", we have a persistent flow at the drift velocity @xmath65 requiring @xmath66 so that the _ critical _ momentum is @xmath67 represents a critical velocity .",
    "the above pedagogical statements or detailed explanations demonstrate the possibility to derive some of the salient features of superfluidity from fundamental principles .",
    "we shall give an example , an ideal bose gas , below to illustrate above mentioned point so that students and researchers can gain more insights into its behavior .",
    "we shall consider an ideal bose gas for a pedagogical illustration . in the interval @xmath68 ,",
    "the lowest energy for a given value @xmath69 can be obtained by assigning the momentum @xmath70 to @xmath71 atoms and @xmath72 to the ( @xmath73 ) atoms .",
    "we then have @xmath74 and from equation ( 7 ) ( as @xmath24 ) , @xmath75 with other intervals being almost the same ( except the period shift ) , we can determine the corresponding function and demonstrate it by the dashed parabolic curves in fig . 2 ( setting @xmath76 ) .",
    "once we add @xmath62 to above expression , we find ( for @xmath77 ) @xmath78 the straight segments which connect the points on the parabola @xmath62 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 represent this function by the dashed line in fig .",
    "3 ( setting @xmath81 ) . as it has no other minimum than that at @xmath45 , we can conclude that the ideal bose gas does not exhibit persistent flow in a contained at rest .",
    "however , we remind the readers that the above property derives from a uniform rotation , rather than a translation , of the container ( thin corrugated annulus ) so that the invariance of the relative velocity against uniform uniform motion of the system of reference can not be invoked in concluding on the case of a contained at rest considered here .",
    "to conclude in brief , we already demonstrate the possibility to derive some of the characteristic features of superfluidity from fundamental principles in a weakly - corrugated thin annulus and we believe our presentation will be useful to researchers in relevant fields .",
