    "the orientation of @xmath9 must correspond under @xmath10 to the usual orientation of @xmath70,1[\\times\\{a\\}$ ] .",

    "the simplest such foliation consists of a complete collection of oriented parallel lines .",

    "we can describe explicitly an oriented reeb foliation @xmath16 as the collection of lines @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , together with the collection of lines @xmath19 for @xmath20 in @xmath21 . the line @xmath22 given by the equation @xmath23 , and the line @xmath24 given by the equation @xmath25 , are the _ nonseparated leaves _ of @xmath16 .",

    "a flow @xmath30 is an _ @xmath0-flow _ if @xmath34 is an @xmath0-homeomorphism for each positive number @xmath35 .",
    "we address the problem of characterizing those @xmath0-homeomorphisms that arise as the time one map of an @xmath0-flow .",
    "in other words , given an @xmath0-homeomorphism @xmath31 , we ask whether there is an @xmath0-flow @xmath30 such that @xmath36 .",
    "such maps @xmath31 we call _ @xmath0-flowable_. there are examples of @xmath0-homeomorphisms that do not arise as the time one map of any planar flow at all ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of characterizing @xmath0-flowable maps is straightforward when @xmath0 is the trivial foliation : each @xmath0-homeomorphism is @xmath0-flowable , and there is only one conjugacy class of flows .",

    "we focus primarily on the reeb foliation @xmath16 , and we characterize the @xmath16-flowable @xmath16-homeomorphisms . in contrast to the trivial foliation , there are uncountably many conjugacy classes of @xmath16-flows ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our techniques extend easily to more general plane foliations ; for example , those foliations described by the last theorem in @xcite , each of which has finitely many nonseparated leaves .",
    "it is more difficult to characterize the @xmath0-flowable @xmath0-homeomorphisms when the foliation @xmath0 has a nonseparated leaf which is the limit of a sequence of nonseparated leaves .",

    "an @xmath16-homeomorphism @xmath31 has the _ four point matching property _ when , given    * a pair @xmath37 in @xmath38 , * a sequence @xmath39 in @xmath1 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and * a sequence @xmath42 in @xmath1 such that @xmath43 ,    it follows that the sequence @xmath42 converges to a point @xmath44 in @xmath22 if and only if the sequence @xmath45 converges to a point @xmath46 in @xmath24 .",

    "since @xmath42 converges to @xmath44 , it follows that @xmath47 converges to @xmath35 .",
    "given that @xmath51 , we deduce that the sequence @xmath45 converges to @xmath52 .",
    "the converse can be verified in a similar manner .",

    "the meaning of this equivalence relation when @xmath31 is an @xmath16-flowable map is that the time taken to flow from @xmath11 to @xmath44 is equal to the time taken to flow from @xmath57 to @xmath46 . using @xmath53 we can define our second condition for characterizing @xmath16-flowable homeomorphisms .",
    "an @xmath16-homeomorphism @xmath31 that satisfies the four point matching property is said to satisfy the _ eight point matching property _",

    "a time one map @xmath31 of a flow @xmath30 has the eight point matching property because each equivalence asserts that the time to flow between a pair of points on @xmath22 is equal to the time to flow between a pair of points on @xmath24 .",

    "furthermore , if there are two @xmath16-flows @xmath30 and @xmath75 such that @xmath76 , then , when restricted to the nonseparated leaves @xmath22 and @xmath24 , @xmath77 for each real number @xmath35 .",
    "we have already proven that @xmath16-flowable maps satisfy the four and eight point matching properties ; in section  [ s : abstract][s : mainproof ] we prove the converse implication . in section  [",
    "s : examples ] we provide an example of an @xmath16-homeomorphism that satisfies the four point matching property , but does not satisfy the eight point matching property , which means that , by theorem  [ t : main ] , it is not @xmath16-flowable .",
    "we also briefly describe an @xmath16-homeomorphism that does not satisfy the four point matching property .",
    "to prove theorem  [ t : main ] we define flows on the nonseparated leaves @xmath22 and @xmath24 , and then extend these flows to a single flow on the whole plane . since @xmath22 and @xmath24 are each homeomorphic to the real line , it is instructive to begin by considering flows on @xmath21 .",
    "each fixed point free order preserving homeomorphism @xmath31 of @xmath21 embeds in uncountably many different flows . in order to pin down a particular flow",
    "whose time one map is @xmath31 , we need more information about the flow . to this end , let @xmath30 be a flow on @xmath21 with @xmath78 , and such that @xmath34 has no fixed points for each @xmath79 .",
    "this flow induces an equivalence relation @xmath80 on @xmath1 given by the property that @xmath81 if and only if there is a real number @xmath35 such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in other words ,",

    "( these equivalence classes should not be confused with the reeb foliation associated with theorem  [ t : main ] . )",

    "now we wish to show that , conversely , conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) are sufficient for an equivalence relation to be generated by a flow whose time one map is @xmath31 .",
    "suppose then that , as before , @xmath31 is a fixed point free order preserving homeomorphism of @xmath21 .",
    "we assume the existence of an equivalence relation @xmath80 on @xmath1 , such that each equivalence class of @xmath80 is the graph of some order preserving homeomorphism of @xmath21 , and such that conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) hold .",

    "clearly every vertical line ( and also every horizontal line ) intersects each equivalence class exactly once . from this and the intermediate value theorem , it is easy to prove that this partition is a trivial foliation .",

    "we can define a map @xmath91 from @xmath92 to @xmath21 by the condition that @xmath93 if and only if @xmath46 is the unique element of @xmath21 such that @xmath94 .",

    "the graph of the first one is the equivalence class of @xmath37 , thus by hypothesis it is an order preserving homeomorphism .",
    "if we identify in a natural way the vertical lines @xmath98 and @xmath99 with @xmath21 , then the second one is the holonomy of the foliation @xmath0 ; that is , the map obtained by following the leaves of @xmath0 from one line to the other one .",
    "it is clear ( and well known ) that such a map is also an order preserving homeomorphism .",
    "similarly , the third map is identified with the holonomy from a horizontal line to a vertical line , and thus is an order reversing homeomorphism .",
