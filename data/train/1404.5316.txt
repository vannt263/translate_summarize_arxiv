    "most of galactic black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries(xrbs ) are transient sources that are detected in x - rays during bright , several - month - long outbursts with typical recurrence periods of many years . during an outburst",
    ", the xrb shows different spectral states associated with a q - like pattern in x - ray hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) . at the beginning and end of the outburst",
    ", xrbs are normally observed in low / hard ( lh ) state , of which the emission is dominated by a power - law component extending to @xmath8 100 kev with a photon index of @xmath9 .",
    "xrbs will stay in high / soft ( hs ) state at high luminosities , where the x - ray spectrum is characterized by a strong thermal black - body emission and a weak power - law component with @xmath10 .",
    "some xrbs also show a steep power - law state with @xmath11 , which differs from the hs state in that the power - law component , rather than the disk component , is dominant ( @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "different spectral states in xrbs are believed to be triggered by different accretion and/or jet processes .",
    "there is little doubt that a cold , optically thick , geometrically thin standard accretion disk ( ssd ; @xcite ) captures the basic physical properties of xrbs in hs state .",
    "soft x - ray bumps as observed in hs state can be naturally explained by multi - temperature blackbody emission of the ssd . the accretion mode for low",
    "/ hard ( lh ) state of xrbs is still a matter of debate .",
    "the prevalent accretion model is a hot , optically thin , geometrically thick advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; also called radiatively inefficient accretion flow , riaf ) that has been developed for bh accreting at low mass accretion rate ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the low density , two - temperature plasma mainly radiates in x - rays , which can well reproduce the observed spectra of xrbs in lh state .",
    "we note that there are also some evidences challenge the pure adaf model for the lh state of xrbs . the broad fe k emission line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or analysis of disk continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that ssd may extend to innermost stable circular orbit in some _ bright _ hard state of xrbs . for xrbs in a steep power - law state ,",
    "the accretion process is very unclear , which may be partly caused by the unknown physical mechanism for disk transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerous studies in the past have shown that hard x - ray photon index , @xmath0 , is correlated with eddington ratio for both xrbs and agns .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed spectral study for six xrbs in the decay of an outburst and found that @xmath0 anti - correlates with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is eddington luminosity ) when @xmath12 is less than a critical value , while they become positively correlated when @xmath12 is higher than this critical value .",

    "the anti- and positive correlations between @xmath0 and eddington ratio can be regulated by adaf and ssd / corona respectively as proposed by @xcite . the detailed model calculations on the adaf and disk / corona do support this scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the lh state can be separated into _ bright _ hard state and _ dim _ hard state , of which the xrbs stay in the positive and anti - correlation of @xmath14 respectively @xcite .",
    "a small cold disk may exist in some _ bright _ hard state of xrbs due to the condensation of hot accretion flow when accretion rate is larger than @xmath80.01 eddington rate , while the inner cold ssd will completely transit to adaf at lower accretion rate due to the possible evaporation @xcite .",
    "there is a strong connection between radio and x - ray emission in the lh state of xrbs .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous radio and x - ray fluxes of more than ten xrbs roughly follow a _",
    "universal _ non - linear correlation of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) as initially found in lh - state gx 3394 and v404 cyg @xcite , which seems to be maintained down to quiescent state @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the radio  x - ray relation for a sample of agns with bh mass of @xmath17 is roughly similar to that of lh - state xrbs , where the agn sample with similar bh mass can be used to simulate the behavior of a single bh xrb in a statistical manner .",

    "the x - ray emission of xrbs is normally thought to originate in the accretion flows ( e.g. , adaf , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the tight correlation of radio and x - ray emission suggests that the jet may be coupled with accretion flow .",

    "the physical reason for the quenched jet in hs state of xrbs is also still unclear , which may be caused by the decrease of the corona due to the stronger cooling when the ssd is present if the jet is coupled with the hot plasma ( adaf / corona , * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite found that the radio  x - ray correlation in xrbs might not be as universal as previously thought .",
    "in the following years , more and more xrbs were found to lie well outside the scatter of the former universal radio  x - ray correlation ( e.g. , xte j1650@xmath22500 , @xcite ; xte j1720 - 318 , @xcite ; swift 1753.5@xmath220127 , @xcite ; igr j17497 - 2821 , @xcite ; h1743@xmath22322 , @xcite ; xte j1752@xmath22223 , @xcite ) .",

    "x - ray correlation are changed at similar critical x - ray flux , which support that the different tracks of radio  x - ray correlation should be regulated by different accretion processes if the x - ray emission originate from accretion flows .    the anti- and positive correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath33 , occurring below and above a critical flux , @xmath2 , may be indicative for some ` switch ' in radiation mechanism at a certain critical accretion rate .",
    "we note that the harder x - ray spectral indices for 17 data points that fitted with a broken power - law are used in investigating of x - ray spectral evolution , which will not affect our main conclusion because both two spectral indices are positively correlated to the x - ray fluxes ( see table 3 ) . adopting a typical bh mass of @xmath55 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and a distance of 8 kpc ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) for these xrbs , we find that the critical eddington ratio for the transition of anti- and positive @xmath35 correlation is @xmath56 1% for h 1743322 , swift j1753.50127 and xte j1752223 , and is @xmath8 10% for gx 3394 , where the bolometric luminosity , @xmath57 , is estimated from power - law emission at 0.1200 kev with the fitted x - ray photon index and flux .",

    "<S> recently an ` outliers ' track of radio  x - ray correlation was found , which is much steeper than the former universal correlation , where dual tracks were speculated to be triggered by different accretion processes . in this work </S>",

    "<S> firstly , we find that hard x - ray photon indices , @xmath0 , are anti- and positively correlated to x - ray fluxes when the x - ray flux , @xmath1 , is below and above a critical flux , @xmath2 , which are consistent with prediction of advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) and disk - corona model respectively . secondly and most importantly , we find that the radio  x - ray correlations are also clearly different when the x - ray fluxes are higher and lower than the critical flux that defined by x - ray spectral evolution . the data points with @xmath3 have a steeper radio  x - ray correlation ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , which roughly form the ` outliers ' track . however , the data points with anti - correlation of @xmath6 either stay in the universal track with @xmath7 or stay in transition track ( from the universal to ` outliers ' tracks or vice versa ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our results support that the universal and ` outliers ' tracks of radio  x - ray correlations are regulated by radiatively inefficient and radiatively efficient accretion model respectively . </S>"
