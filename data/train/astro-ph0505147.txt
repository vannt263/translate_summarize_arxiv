    "quasar absorption line systems are one of the best objects to trace the physical nature of the evolving universe . among various absorption systems ,",
    "damped ly @xmath0 systems ( dlas ) are the intercepting objects that have highest hi column density .",
    "it is a common knowledge that dlas are the progenitors of present - day galaxies .",
    "but substantial debate continues over exactly what populations of galaxies are responsible for them .",
    "thanks to the large facilities available during the past decade , more and more data about dlas are being provided by various observers ( see prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in order to have real understanding of the physical nature of dlas ,",
    "theorists have been using different ways to explain the observed properties , such as simple galaxy model(hou , boissier & prantzos 2001 ; calura , matteucci & vladilo 2003 ; boissier , p@xmath3roux & pettini 2003 ; lanfranchi & friaca 2003 ) ; semi - analytical models(sams)(cen et al .",

    "2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will adopt a sam to examine in detail the observed metallicity , hi column density and star formation properties of dlas in the context of standard hierarchical picture of structure formation of the universe . the disk galaxy formation model with single disks",
    "is adopted because we mainly concentrate on hi column densities and the cosmic star formation rate density contributed by dlas rather than their kinematics . as an illustration ,",
    "dla properties are assumed at redshift @xmath4 and the standard @xmath5cdm cosmogony is adopted .",
    "the galaxy formation model in this paper comes from that for disk galaxies suggested by mo , mao & white ( 1998 , hereafter mmw ) . in the model of mmw",
    ", the halo mass function at any redshift @xmath6 can be described by the press - schechter formalism ( press & schschter 1974 ) .",
    "the relation between halo mass @xmath7 and its circular velocity @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 is hubble constant at redshift @xmath6 .",
    "details about the model description can be found in mmw .",
    "the distribution function of halo spin parameter can be described by a log - normal function based on numerical simulation .",
    "disks are assumed to have exponential surface profiles @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the central surface density and the scale length .",
    "the disk global properties can be uniquely determined by parameters @xmath15 , @xmath8 , @xmath16 and the adopted cosmogony , where @xmath15 is the halo dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath8 is the halo circular velocity , @xmath16 is the mass ratio of disk to halo . here , we have adopted the @xmath16 as a function of @xmath8 in order to consider the galactic winds and outflow(shu et al .",
    "2003 ) .    after knowing the distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath15 for halos , we are able to generate a sample of disk galaxies by monte - carlo simulation in the @xmath8-@xmath15 plane at redshift @xmath17 , which is the parent sample for our follow - up dla simulation",
    ".      the adopted star formation prescription comes from disk galaxy modelling of boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) . under the approximation of instantaneous recycling , chemical evolution in disks can be expressed by the simple closed - box model with metallicity @xmath18 to be @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the initial metallicity of gas and is assumed to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the effective yield , and @xmath23 is the gas fraction .",
    "we assume that at the initial time ( @xmath24 ) , the gas surface density @xmath25 .",
    "star formation proceeds within disks in a typical time scale 1@xmath26 ( lanfranchi & friaca 2003 ; dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "the effective yield @xmath22 is assumed to be constant and is obtained by comparing the metallicity distributions between model predictions and observations for dlas .",
    "the modelled dlas are selected over the sampled galaxies by random sightlines penetrating disks according to the observed selection criterion , i.e. , @xmath27 . here",
    ", random inclinations for disks in the sky are considered .",
    "dlas have shown many observational properties , including metallicities , column densities , kinematics , etc .",
    "the observed metallicities of dlas adopted in the present paper mainly come from hou , boissier & prantzos ( 2001 ) and kulkarni & fall ( 2002 ) for the zn element .",
    "all the data presented by those authors are compiled from the results of various observers .",
    "the observed data of hi column densities come from the survey of storrie - lombardi & wolfe ( 2000 ) ( hereafter sw00 ) .",
    "since our model focuses on dlas at redshift @xmath28 , the observed properties of dlas with redshift @xmath29 are selected for comparison .      in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we show the resulted distribution of the impact parameters of selected dlas . it is found that the peak is around 3kpc , which is resulted from the huge amount of small halos in ps formalism and the finite radius for individual galaxies that can produce dlas . because the dlas are dominated by small galaxies which are always faint , the peak implies that the host galaxies of dlas are difficult to be observed photometrically .",
    "the only free parameter in the present model is the effective stellar yield @xmath22 , which is determined by comparing the predicted metallicity distribution with observed one at redshift greater than 2 .",
    "the model prediction for the metallicity distributions of dlas is plotted as a solid histogram in fig .",
    "1(b ) while the observed distributions of dlas with @xmath30 and all dlas are plotted as dashed and dotted histograms , respectively .",
    "we get the effect yield @xmath31 for the best - fit result with the assumption of star formation timescale for dlas being random between 1 and 3gyr .",
    "based on the selected dla sample , we can get the predicted sfr density contributed by dlas at @xmath17 and show it as a cross in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 which displays the cosmic sfr density as a function of redshift resulted from different observations .",
    "the sfr density for dlas with @xmath32 based on the @xmath33 absorption lines are also plotted in the figure as triangles(wolfe gawsier & prochaska 2003 , hereafter wgp03 ) .",
    "it can be found that the model prediction is consistent with observations and supports the  consensus \" model described by wgp03 .    in the right panel of fig.2",
    ", we show , with solid histogram , the predicted uv luminosity function of selected dla hosts galaxies .",
    "the observed and dust - corrected uv luminosity functions of lbgs are also plotted as full circles ( data from aldelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "it can be found that the typical @xmath34 magnitude of the predicted dla hosts is @xmath35 , which are much fainter than lbgs with typical @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that a typical dla host galaxy in our model has its sfr about 100 times smaller than a typical lbg .",
    "because the number density of dla host galaxies is about 0.26 which is about 100 times larger than the observed comoving number density of lbgs , our predictions of cosmic sfr density contributed by dlas is similar to that of lbgs at @xmath28 .",
    "the frequency distribution of hi column density @xmath37 for dlas , which is defined as the number of absorbers per unit @xmath38 and per unit absorption distance @xmath39 , is very important for understanding galaxy formation and evolution in the universe .",
    "we plot the model prediction of @xmath40 at @xmath28 in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 as a solid line while the observed frequency distributions for dlas with @xmath41 3.5 from sw00 is plotted as circles with error bars respectively .",
    "it can be found from the figure that the predicted distribution agrees well with observations at the high @xmath38 end .",
    "but it is smaller than observations at low @xmath38 end with the maximum difference as large as 3@xmath42 , i.e. , the predicted distribution is a bit flatter than observed ones .",
    "the similar discrepancy appear in the more complicated numerical simulation study of nagamine , springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) as well .",
    "this could be due to the limitation of our simple model or perhaps this could be a failing of the @xmath43 power spectrum which deserves further investigations .",
    "another unusual property of dlas is that there exists an anti - correlation between [ zn / h ] and hi column densities , which is independent of redshift as noticed by boiss et al.(1998 ) , who claimed that this anti - correlation is mainly due to observational selection effects due to dust . in order to test this bias , ellison et al.(2001 )",
    "have surveyed a sample of dlas toward radio selected quasars and found no significant difference in the hi distribution to those optically selected quasars . moreover ,",
    "dust obscuration has also been argued by prochaska & wolfe ( 2002 ) , who made a detailed analysis of dust extinction contained in dlas .",
    "they found that inferred extinction values and apparent magnitudes imply dust obscuration plays a relatively minor effect in the dla analysis at least for @xmath30 .",
    "we examine the predicted correlation between metallicity and hi column density for the selected dla sample in fig.3(right panel ) with the observed results of dlas at @xmath44 by open circles .",
    "as expected , model predictions show an opposite trend compared with observations .",
    "if we apply the proposed bias of @xmath45 + log}(n_{\\rm hi } ) > 21 $ ] in fig.3 ( long dashed line ) , to exclude the points above this line , the difference still exists .",
    "this means that the suggestions of boiss et al ( 1998 ) did not help a lot in alleviating the discrepancy in our model",
    ".    another possibility could be the inadequacy of the adopted schmidt type star formation prescription in the model .",
    "even for nearby galaxies , the physical basis of star formation is still poorly known .",
    "observers have shown various empirical prescriptions for star formation in spirals ( kennicutt 1998 ; wong & blitz 2002 ) , and most of galaxies can be fitted by a schmidt type law .",
    "this has been widely applied in models of galaxy evolution .",
    "in fact , gas surface density ( @xmath46 ) includes both the contributions of hi ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) with @xmath47 being dominant but the correlation between these two is different from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "recent observations of star formation regions in nearby galaxies done by wong & blitz ( 2002 ) showed a complex relationship between sfr and @xmath50 . for their spiral galaxies sample ( biased to molecule - rich galaxies )",
    ", sfr shows virtually no correlation with @xmath50 , suggesting a maximum hi column density around @xmath51 .",
    "this is very instructive to the star formation history for dlas , where the observed hi column density seems have an upper limit .",
    "we show in this contribution that the semi - analytical model based on the galaxy formation and evolution framework of hierarchical structure formation scenario is quite successful in understanding the dlas properties .",
    "our simple model could well reproduce most of the observed dla properties , such as metallicity and column density distributions , star formation rate density contributed by dlas and so on .",
    "however , we found that as long as the kennicutt star formation prescription is adopted , model always predict a positive correlation between hi column density and metallicity , opposite to that observed .",
    "different explanations exist , for example , observational bias and dust obscuration .",
    "we suggest that the observed trend of anti - correlation could most probably be physical ( see also schaye 2001 )",
    ". a most promising explanation might be the inadequacy of kennicutt star formation law in the high redshift environment .",
    "more observations and theoretical investigations are needed to clarify this trend in the future .",
