    "the turn of the century witnessed a renewed interest in einstein s gravity .",
    "the research focus extends nowadays to numerical simulations of the full time evolution ( inspiral , merger and ring - down phases ) of black hole binary systems @xcite , numerical simulations of high energy collisions of black holes @xcite , and the study of higher - dimensional black holes @xcite , mainly in vacuum and in asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes .",
    "the former two endeavours are of the utmost interest for gravitational wave experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter programme was triggered by the quest for a microscopic description of black holes in a theory of quantum gravity ( string theory ) , by the emergence of tev - scale gravity scenarios relevant for the lhc , and by the realization that black holes describe thermal phases of gauge theories in holographic gauge / gravity dualities .",
    "the properties of higher - dimensional black holes , namely their stability , will be the main focus of the present work , and we review its motivations in more detail next .",
    "black hole thermodynamics and the thermal spectrum of hawking radiation strongly suggests the existence of a statistical mechanical description of black holes in terms of some underlying microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "this microscopic description necessarily requires quantum gravity .",
    "one of the most compelling candidates for such a theory is string theory , which inevitably requires gravity in extra dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the observation that the black hole entropy is proportional to the horizon area strongly suggests that the quantum degrees of freedom of the black hole are distributed over a surface @xcite .",
    "this led to the formulation of the holographic principle according to which quantum gravity in a given volume should have a description in terms of a quantum field theory on its boundary .",
    "the last decade witnessed concrete realizations of this holographic idea , namely the ads / cft duality and more generically the gauge / gravity correspondence @xcite .",
    "the application of these ideas to certain classes of higher - dimensional black holes has already provided a statistical description of some of their thermodynamic properties .",
    "successful examples include : i ) a statistical counting of the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite , ii ) a microscopic description of hawking emission in near - extremal black holes @xcite , iii ) a microscopic description of superradiant emission @xcite , iv ) the map between the hawking - page phase transition in asymptotically ads black holes and the confinement / deconfinement phase transition in gauge theories that share some common properties with qcd @xcite , and v ) the identification of the quasinormal modes of oscillation of a black hole with the thermalization frequencies of the perturbed holographic field theory @xcite , to mention but a few .",
    "following these early successes , the gauge / gravity correspondence has matured and is nowadays a field of research on its own . mainly due to the fact that this is a weak / strong coupling duality , it is recognized as a powerful technical tool to understand not only gravity but also strongly coupled gauge theories . in recent years",
    "this correspondence has been extended to other systems of interest , namely , the fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite and more recently the condensed matter / gravity correspondence @xcite .",
    "these developments indicate that gravitational physics is becoming a valuable technical tool to understand several other branches of physics .",
    "given the holographic nature of these correspondences , and since we are often interested in gauge theories in four dimensions , it is therefore important to develop our understanding of gravity in five and higher dimensions .",
    "the lhc will soon be operating at the tev energy frontier .",
    "although it was designed to find the higgs boson and study particle physics beyond the standard model , there is the possibility that the lhc discovers extra dimensions .",
    "indeed , in recent years various tev - scale gravity or braneworld scenarios have been proposed according to which extra dimensions might be detected at the energy scales probed by the lhc ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the motivation for these proposals is the solution of the hierarchy problem , i.e. ,  the huge difference between the planck scale and the electroweak scale . by proposing the existence of sufficiently ",
    "large \" extra dimensions , the fundamental ( @xmath10-dimensional ) planck mass can be of the order of the electroweak energy ( @xmath11 tev )",
    ". the most fascinating outcome of these scenarios is the possibility of producing microscopic black holes at the lhc .",
    "this could allow for the experimental determination of the fundamental scale of gravity , the number of extra dimensions , and the decay product of higher - dimensional black holes , including the first evidence of hawking evaporation @xcite .",
    "this fascinating possiblity provides an extra motivation to undergo the study of higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "stimulated by the advances in higher - dimensional gravitational physics , there is an intensive ongoing program to extend analytical tools and numerical relativity to higher dimensions .",
    "the newman - penrose and geroch - held - penrose formalisms , and the resulting petrov classification , which are important to classify solutions and study their stability , have been extended to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the separability of some class of perturbation equations and the existence of completely integrable geodesic equations in some higher dimensional black holes is possible due to the fact that there are hidden and explicit symmetries associated with the principal conformal killing - yano tensor @xcite .",
    "the study of higher - dimensional gravity is also motivating the development of completely new analytical tools , like the blackfold approach @xcite , to construct perturbative solutions based on the fact that for higher - dimensional black holes the horizons can have widely separated length scales .",
    "simultaneously , the first non - linear numerical codes in higher dimensions are starting to be developed mainly to study the time evolution of instabilities in black holes @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be an area of active research in the near future .",
    "in addition , the challenges of higher - dimensional black hole physics have motivated the introduction of new numerical tools , like the spectral methods @xcite .",
    "last but not least , another motivation to study higher - dimensional black holes is the understanding of these objects _ per se_. indeed , to uncover the mathematical structure of einstein s gravity and its solutions",
    "one should treat the number of spacetime dimensions @xmath10 as a free parameter in the theory .",
    "we should be able to distinguish between the universal properties of the theory and the dimension dependent ones .",
    "it is known since the 70 s that @xmath13 black holes are the simplest gravitational objects in nature .",
    "hawking s black hole topology theorem states that a @xmath13 black hole must have an event horizon with spherical topology @xcite .",
    "together with hawking s rigidity theorem @xcite this led to the proof of the @xmath13 uniqueness theorems @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a @xmath13 vacuum black hole is fully specified by its conserved charges : mass @xmath14 and angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , there is a unique black hole in @xmath13 einstein gravity @xmath16 the kerr solution @xmath16 which has an upper bound on its angular momentum , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being newton s constant ) .",
    "however , are these universal properties of gravity ? or are some of them dimension dependent ?",
    "the last decade has provided a cascade of fascinating answers to these questions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the higher - dimensional arena is populated by new solutions besides the myers - perry ( mp ) black hole with @xmath19 topology @xcite @xmath16 the ( non - trivial ) counterpart of the @xmath13 kerr solution .",
    "the simplest black object in @xmath10 dimensions is a black string with horizon topology @xmath20 or a black brane with @xmath21 , constructed by adding trivial flat direction(s ) to the metric of the schwarzchild geometry .",
    "the most surprising analytical solution is however the @xmath22 black ring found by emparan and reall @xcite .",
    "this solution is asymptotically flat , has horizon topology @xmath23 and in some regions of the parameter space it can carry the same conserved charges as the singly - spinning myers - perry black hole .",
    "therefore , this solution explicitly demonstrates that the topology and uniqueness theorems do not generalize straightforwardly to higher dimensions when rotation is considered .",
    "indeed , the generalisation of the black hole topology theorem imposes much weaker restrictions on the horizon topology @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath22 uniqueness theorems , restricted to geometries with two @xmath24 killing isometries , explicitly show that in order to uniquely specify a black hole solution , one has to fix the conserved charges _ and _ other parameters not related to them @xcite ( see also @xcite for some earlier work ) . using the complete integrability of the five - dimensional einstein s vacuum equations restricted to solutions with @xmath25 killing isometries , it has been also possible to construct explicitly the black rings with rotation only along the @xmath26 ( which possess conical singularities ) @xcite , the regular doubly - spinning black ring @xcite , and regular asymptotically flat multi - black hole objects like black saturns @xcite , di - rings @xcite and bi - cycling rings @xcite .",
    "these solutions provide further examples of the richness of higher @xmath10 gravity . in @xmath27 ,",
    "the integrability methods are not available , but the perturbative blackfold approach of @xcite has provided evidence for the existence of black objects with other ( non - spherical ) topologies @xcite .",
    "all these solutions have multiple @xmath24 rotational symmetries and need to be organized in a classification scheme .",
    "to provide such a classification we must address the question of to what extent the rigidity theorem extends to higher dimensions . in higher dimensions ,",
    "stationarity only implies the existence of one rigid rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "however all higher - dimensional solutions known exactly have more than one such symmetry .",
    "a fundamental question is whether there are stationary black holes with less symmetry than those solutions .",
    "this possibility was first raised in @xcite , where the existence of stationary black holes with a single @xmath24 was conjectured .",
    "we shall return to this fundamental issue below .",
    "having these explicit solutions , the next natural question is whether they are dynamically stable against linear perturbations .",
    "start with the kerr solution in vacuum .",
    "smarr observed that , as the rotation increases , the horizon gaussian curvature at the poles starts positive , becomes zero at a critical rotation , and then goes negative before the kerr bound @xmath28 is reached @xcite .",
    "he further noticed that a similar behaviour occurs in rotating fluid droplets held by surface tension , where this behaviour signals an instability .",
    "however , soon after smarr made this remark , teukolsky used the newman - penrose formalism to find the master equation that governs the gravitational perturbations of the kerr black hole , which was used by whiting to show the mode - by - mode stability of the kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "what about mp black holes ? for @xmath0 ,",
    "the rotation of a singly - spinning mp can grow unbounded , as already noticed in @xcite .",
    "this led emparan and myers to propose that , for sufficiently high rotation , these black holes should become unstable against what was called the _ ultraspinning _ limit @xcite . the natural way to check the presence of this instability would be to apply a linear perturbation analysis using the newman - penrose formalism , this time for @xmath0 . unfortunately , although this formalism and the associated geroch - held - penrose formalism have been extended to higher dimensions , it is extremely difficult if not impossible to manipulate the equations to get decoupled master equations for the perturbations @xcite .",
    "so , in practice , we can not use it yet to treat the perturbation problem analytically .",
    "given these limitations , emparan - myers provided solid heuristic arguments , that we highlight next , to conjecture the existence of an instability for a sufficiently large rotation @xcite . take a mp black hole rotating along a single plane for simplicity . in the _ ultraspinning _",
    "regime , @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the horizon radius ) , the black hole horizon flattens out along the plane of rotation and its shape can be approximated by that of black disk of radius @xmath32 and thickness @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can take a precise limit in which the mp black hole metric near the rotation axis reduces to the metric of a static black membrane with horizon topology @xmath33 , and where the worldvolume directions of the membrane correspond to the directions along the original rotation plane @xcite .",
    "this is a far - reaching observation since black membranes are afflicted by the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability @xcite .",
    "this led the authors of @xcite to conjecture that ultraspinning mp black holes should be unstable under a gregory - laflamme - type of instability ( see subsection [ subsec : ultramotivations ] for more details ) . according to the arguments of @xcite",
    ", this instability should become active when @xmath34 , and it provides an effective dynamical bound on the angular momentum .",
    "as often occurs in physical systems , and in particular in the context of black branes @xcite , the stationary threshold of the ultraspinning instability is expected to signal also a bifurcation point in a phase diagram of solutions into a new branch of pinched black objects .",
    "new thresholds are expected at higher rotations , from which additional branches of pinched solutions should bifurcate .",
    "these conjectured stationary solutions preserve the original mp symmetries , but have spherical horizons distorted by ripples along the polar direction , and are conjectured to connect to the black ring and black saturn families in a phase diagram of stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to firmly establish the properties of the threshold of this ultraspinning instability .",
    "a practical use of the newman - penrose formalism in higher dimensions is not yet available so we will resort to a numerical approach . in a previous publication , we have already addressed this problem in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the present manuscript , however , extends the former study in several directions .",
    "we present for the first time the properties of the instability in the six - dimensional case .",
    "this is an important case since @xmath2 is the lowest dimension where the instability is present , and it was not addressed in @xcite due to numerical difficulties .",
    "moreover , we discuss the instability in @xmath35 and @xmath36 dimensions that are relevant for string theory .",
    "we also address the @xmath37 case , in which the black hole does not have an ultraspinning regime ( in the sense that defined in subsection [ subsec : ultrathermo ] ) .",
    "consequently , no instability that preserves the spatial isometries of the background can be present , as we confirm numerically . at a more technical level",
    ", we will provide the first detailed discussion of the boundary conditions of the problem .",
    "while doing so we will prove that the ultraspinning modes preserve the temperature and angular velocity of the background , an aspect that was not discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is a keypoint to formally establish the thermodynamic criterium ( which is a necessary condition , not a sufficient one ) for the critical rotation above which black holes can be afflicted by the ultraspinning instability .",
    "it can be seen as a refinement of the gubser - mitra conjecture @xcite .",
    "this thermodynamic criterium was first proposed in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite .",
    "we will also prove the claim of @xcite that the ultraspinning threshold modes that we find can not be pure gauge modes .",
    "the ultraspinning instability is not unique to singly - spinning mp black holes .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that it is also present in the case of mp black holes with equal angular momenta along the @xmath38 rotation planes that are allowed in @xmath10 dimensions ( here @xmath39 stands for the smallest integer part ) .",
    "this occurs in spite of the fact that for these black holes , contrary to the singly - spinning case , the angular momenta have an upper bound .",
    "the keypoint is that the aforementioned thermodynamic criterium ( subsection 2.2 ) still allows for an ultraspinning regime . in the equal spins case and in odd spacetime dimensions , the geometry is codimension-1 , i.e. ,  it only depends on the radial coordinate .",
    "this simplifies considerably the analysis of the perturbed einstein equations since they reduce to a coupled system of odes . for this reason ,",
    "the detailed study of the time dependence of the instability is much simpler , and @xcite found , as expected , that the modes responsible for the ultraspinning instability grow exponentially with time .",
    "this fact provides strong confidence to expect that a similar situation occurs in the singly - spinning case .",
    "the analysis of the ultraspinning instability in the equal spins case @xcite gave the first evidence for the existence of a new family of topologically spherical black hole solutions with only a _",
    "single _ rotational symmetry , i.e. ,  solutions that saturate hawking s rigidity theorem in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "there is a previous example of a black object with a single rotational symmetry but different horizon topology @xcite : the  helical \" black rings that can be perturbatively constructed using the blackfold approach @xcite .",
    "these developments confirm the conjecture put forward in @xcite and can fairly be seen as one of the most important legacies of the ultrapinning instability studies and of the blackfold approach .",
    "more recently @xcite , near horizon geometries of extremal black holes have been found with a single rotational symmetry .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sec : ultraspin ] , we will review the ultraspinning instability conjecture as formulated in @xcite , together with the refined thermodynamic criterium of @xcite , and we will formulate the problem of finding the modes responsible for the ultraspinning instability as an eigenvalue problem . in section [ sec :",
    "bcs ] , we will discuss the boundary conditions appropriate to the problem at hand and we will prove that the threshold modes searched numerically can not be pure gauge . in section [ sec :",
    "results ] , we will present our results and finally we will close with a discussion .",
    "an appendix contains the technical details of the horizon embeddings .",
    "in subsection [ subsec : ultramotivations ] , we will review the work of @xcite where the conjecture of the ultraspinning instability of singly - spinning mp black holes was first formulated . in subsection [ subsec :",
    "ultrathermo ] , we will review the thermodynamic arguments that led the authors of @xcite to extend the ultraspinning conjecture to other classes of black holes which need not admit an arbitrarily large angular momentum ( per unit mass ) . finally , in subsection [ subsec : ultraeigenvalue ] , we will formulate our perturbation problem as an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the metric of the @xmath10-dimensional asymptotically flat mp black hole spinning in a single plane is given by @xcite @xmath40 ^ 2 + \\frac{\\sigma(r,\\theta)}{\\delta(r)}\\,dr^2 + \\sigma(r,\\theta)\\,d\\theta^2 \\\\ & + r^2\\cos^2\\theta\\ , d\\omega^2_{(d-4)}\\,,\\label{mpbh } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the line element of a unit @xmath42sphere and @xmath43 this solution of the einstein vacuum equations is characterised by two parameters , namely the mass - radius @xmath44 and the rotation parameter @xmath32 , r_m^d-3=,a= , where @xmath45 $ ] is the volume of a unit - radius @xmath46-sphere , @xmath18 denotes newton s constant and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the adm mass and angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the ( outer ) event horizon lies at the largest real root @xmath47 of @xmath48 , that is , @xmath49 for @xmath50 a regular horizon exists for all values of @xmath32 up to the kerr bound , @xmath51 @xmath52 , which corresponds to an extremal ( i.e. , zero temperature ) black hole with finite size horizon area . in @xmath37 the situation is somewhat similar : a regular solution exists for all values of @xmath32 than @xmath44 .",
    "the solution with @xmath53 corresponds to a naked singularity . on the other hand , for @xmath0",
    ", @xmath54 always has a ( single ) positive real root for _ all _ values of @xmath32 and therefore there exist black holes ( which are always non - extremal ) with arbitrarily large angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "these black holes were dubbed `` ultraspinning '' in @xcite and they will be the object of our study in this paper .    in the limit of large angular momentum",
    ", these black holes can be characterised by two widely separated length scales on the horizon @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the characteristic length scale in the directions parallel to the rotation plane , and @xmath56 in the directions perpendicular to it . for @xmath29",
    ", we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 , that is , @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the mp black hole spreads out along the plane of rotation and it resembles a black membrane . , @xmath60 and @xmath61 while keeping @xmath62 and @xmath63 fixed , the singly - spinning mp black hole metric near the rotation axis @xmath64 , reduces to the metric of a black membrane . in particular , the spatial directions along the worldvolume of the membrane correspond to the directions along the original plane of rotation in . ]",
    "this observation has far reaching consequences because black branes are known to be unstable @xcite .",
    "this led the authors of @xcite to conjecture that rapidly rotating mp black holes should be unstable under gregory - laflamme type perturbations that preserve the symmetries of the @xmath65-sphere .",
    "more precisely , choosing a cylindrical basis in polar coordinates @xmath66 on the plane of the membrane , in the @xmath67 limit , the unstable modes should be of the form @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the wavenumber along the direction parallel to the rotation . in this paper",
    "we will only address the axisymmetric case @xmath70 , for which the radial profile is given by a cylindrical wave @xmath71 . by extrapolating these observations to finite ( but sufficiently large ) @xmath32 ,",
    "one concludes that there should exist unstable modes that depend only on @xmath72 and @xmath73 and do not break any of the symmetries of the background black hole @xcite .    by considering the thermodynamics of singly - spinning mp black holes ,",
    "the authors of @xcite observed that , for @xmath0 , these objects exhibit two markedly different behaviors depending on the value of @xmath32 .",
    "for instance , consider the temperature of these black holes : @xmath74 for fixed mass , @xmath31 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , it follows from that , starting from @xmath75 , the temperature decreases as @xmath32 increases , as in the kerr black hole case .",
    "however , at @xmath76 the temperature reaches a minimum and then it starts growing like @xmath77 as @xmath32 increases .",
    "this is the kind of behavior of the temperature of a black membrane as the rotation increases .",
    "this point was proposed to give an order of magnitude for the appearance of the instability @xcite .",
    "notice from that the membrane - like behavior occurs for @xmath78 in all dimensions ( see the first column in table [ table : critrot ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper , which builds on @xcite , will be to show that this picture is indeed correct .",
    "furthermore , it is known @xcite that the threshold zero - mode @xmath79 of the gl instability gives rise to a new branch of static non - uniform strings .",
    "this led the authors of @xcite to conjecture that the zero - modes of the ultraspinning instability should give rise to a sequence of new branches of stationary and axisymmetric black holes that preserve all the @xmath80 isometries of the singly - spinning mp black hole , and that have ripples along the polar direction @xmath73 .",
    "this conjecture was further refined in @xcite , which argued that this structure of an infinite sequence of lumpy black holes is in fact needed in order to connect singly - spinning mp black holes to black rings , black saturns and other black objects which include multiple concentric rings that should exist in @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig : phases ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we will refine the arguments of @xcite that we have reviewed above , and we will present the closely related conjecture made in ref .",
    "the basic statement of this conjecture is that classical instabilities associated with stationary zero - modes can only appear in a regime which we call _",
    "ultraspinning_. we analyze this regime for the mp family of solutions .",
    "we will also argue that a stationary zero - mode of the black hole can correspond : ( @xmath81 ) to a change in the parameters of the solution , if the zero - mode can be predicted by the condition of local thermodynamic stability , or ( @xmath82 ) to the threshold of a classical instability of the black hole , which in our case will correspond to the prediction of @xcite .      as discussed before ,",
    "it was conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that rapidly - rotating mp black holes with a single spin in @xmath83 were unstable for gregory - laflamme - type modes .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate for the critical rotation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mintemp ] ) , was given by considering the thermodynamic behavior .",
    "the estimate for brane - like behavior is actually a zero - mode of the thermodynamic hessian @xmath84 which we readily generalized to accomodate several spins .",
    "the condition of local thermodynamic stability is the positivity of this hessian .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath85 possesses at least one negative eigenvalue for any asymptotically flat vacuum black hole ( only the smarr relation and the first law are required ) .",
    "hence all such black holes are locally thermodynamically unstable . in the mp family , this is the only negative eigenvalue for small rotations . for @xmath0 , as the rotation increases , the black hole acquires an additional thermodynamic instability , and a corresponding gregory - laflamme type instability of the associated black branes ( this is a refinement of the gubser - mitra conjecture @xcite )",
    ".    ref .",
    "@xcite ( see @xcite for the rotating case ) showed that a zero - mode of the thermodynamic hessian is also a zero - mode of the action , i.e. an on - shell stationary perturbation of the black hole .",
    "however , this type of zero - mode consists of an infinitesimal change in the asymptotic charges of the black hole solution , within the mp family . in the singly - spinning case , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mintemp ] ) signals a degenerate point for which an infinitesimal change in the angular momentum at fixed mass does not change the temperature or the angular velocity of the mp black hole ( indeed , our metric perturbations preserve these quantities , as we discuss later ) .",
    "this corresponds to the inflection point @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] .",
    "notice that we are using the mp equation of state @xmath87 to identify the zero - mode .",
    "hence it does not have to be related to the bifurcation to a new family of solutions , and to the instability commonly associated with a bifurcation .",
    "only zero - modes of the black hole which are not associated with the degeneracy of the hessian ( [ thermohessian ] ) can represent bifurcations and instabilities .",
    "@xcite and the present work confirm numerically the conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that a zero - mode appears at ( [ eqn : mintemp ] ) , i.e. when the hessian ( [ thermohessian ] ) is degenerate .",
    "more importantly , it is confirmed that additional zero - modes which are not thermodynamic in origin occur for higher rotations .",
    "the latter zero - modes are thresholds for _ classical _ instabilities of the black hole , as explicitly verified for mp codimension-1 solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "zero - modes which are thermodynamic in origin can be identified as the zero - modes of the simpler reduced hessian @xmath88 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the mp family ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath89 are all positive for small enough angular momenta , at fixed @xmath14 . however ,",
    "as some or all of the angular momenta are increased , some eigenvalues of @xmath89 may become negative .",
    "we define the boundary of the region in which @xmath89 is positive definite to be the _ ultraspinning surface_. following ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall say that a given black hole is ultraspinning if it lies outside the ultraspinning surface . hence ,",
    "as one crosses the ultraspinning surface , the black hole will develop a new thermodynamic instability , and the associated black branes will develop a new classical instability .",
    "this is in addition to the usual gregory - laflamme instability already present at small angular momenta .    ref .",
    "@xcite conjectured that classical instabilities whose threshold is a stationary and axisymmetric zero - mode occur only for rotations higher than a thermodynamic zero - mode , i.e. in the ultraspinning regime .",
    "we emphasize that the conjecture gives a necessary condition for this instability , not a sufficient one .",
    "notice that by axisymmetric we mean that the @xmath90 killing isometry ( or @xmath91 for more spins ) is preserved .",
    "the intuition leading to the conjecture is that modes of lower symmetry are usually the most unstable ones .",
    "for instance , the original gregory - laflamme instability occurs for the s - wave of the transversal black hole .",
    "an additional classical instability will arise after a critical value of the rotation , and it will correspond to a p - wave of the transversal black hole .",
    "as the rotation is increased , higher order waves may become unstable .",
    "now , if we consider a black hole , instead of a black brane , the s - wave and the p - wave are associated with the asymptotic charges , mass and angular momenta .",
    "therefore they are associated to purely thermodynamic instabilities .",
    "higher order waves , on the other hand , may become classically unstable as the rotation is increased , starting with the d - wave .",
    "notice that these waves do not affect the asymptotic charges .",
    ", it was explicitly shown that the first zero - mode changed only the angular momenta , breaking their equality , and that the next zero - modes ( associated with classical instabilities / bifurcations ) did not affect the asymptotic charges . ]",
    "the fact that the thresholds of classical instabilities should be associated with bifurcations to different black hole families highlights the connection between stability and uniqueness .",

    "this instability is captured by a class of perturbations that preserve the @xmath272 symmetries of the background , as well as the angular velocity and temperature of the original mp black hole .",
    "these perturbations ( in the tt gauge ) must satisfy the lichnerowicz system of equations .",
    "our strategy however was to solve the more general _",
    "problem because : i ) there are powerful numerical routines to solve generalized eigenvalue problems of this kind ; and ii ) this also allows us to study gregory - laflamme@xmath16like instabilities of the associated black string . in short , varying the rotation parameter @xmath32 of the background black hole we searched for the negative modes of the problem , i.e. ,  for solutions that have generically @xmath129 .",
    "we found several families of negative modes that exhibit an underlying harmonic structure , although the equations that we solve do not seem to separate .",
    "we used this to suggestively label the several branches by an integer @xmath223 .",
    "this integer coincides with the number of zeros of the metric perturbations on the horizon .",
    "the family @xmath273 always has @xmath129 , and coincides with the well - known negative mode of the schwarzchild - tangherlini solution when the rotation parameter @xmath32 vanishes @xcite .",
    "this family therefore describes the critical mode @xmath274 of the original gregory - laflamme instability of the black string @xcite when @xmath75 , and our results show how it evolves as the rotation increases : the value of the threshold wavenumber @xmath241 increases with the rotation .",
    "the branches with @xmath275 are more interesting since they intersect the @xmath132 axis at a critical @xmath276 ( see table [ table : critrot ] ) .",
    "thus they describe not only _ new _ types of gregory - laflamme instabilities of rotating black strings , but they also represent , for @xmath277 , true instabilities of the mp _",
    "black hole_. for black strings , the onset of these instabilities is conjectured to signal a bifurcation to new branches of non - uniform black strings in which the horizon is deformed along both the direction of the string _ and _ the polar direction of the transverse sphere . at a given rotation , the @xmath251 mode has the shortest wavelength @xmath278 and hence it should dominate the instability of the black string .",
    "from now on , we focus our attention only on the consequences of our findings for the stability of the mp black holes . the critical rotation where the @xmath251 mode appears",
    "can be predicted by the thermodynamic argument of @xcite ( see section 2.2 ) , which can be seen as a refinement of the gubser - mitra conjecture . accordingly",
    ", this mode does _ not _ correspond to a true instability of the mp black hole .",
    "instead , we have interpreted it as a thermodynamic mode that corresponds to a variation of the parameters within the mp family of solutions such that it preserves the temperature and angular velocity of the background ( section [ sec : results ] , and point @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ) .",
    "the modes with @xmath279 describe the onset of true ultraspinning instabilities of the mp black hole . in section [ sec :",
    "results ] , we have studied the deformations that these modes produce on the horizon of the black hole for @xmath239 ( just for concreteness ) and found that they give rise to the kind of deformations predicted in @xcite . in addition , we have shown that , for large @xmath32 and near @xmath64 , our numerical results are well - approximated by a bessel function , which is in agreement with the heuristic arguments of @xcite . altogether , these results provide solid evidence in favor of the ultraspinning instability conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the thresholds of the ultraspinning instabilities are expected to signal bifurcations to new branches of axisymmetric solutions with pinched horizons in a phase diagram of stationary solutions ( see points @xmath280 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ) .",
    "although these pinched black holes have the same isometries as the original mp black hole , their spherical - topology horizons are distorted by ripples along the polar direction . when continued in the full non - linear regime ,",
    "these new branches of solutions are conjectured to connect to the black ring and black saturn families @xcite .",
    "although we have identified the critical values of the rotation where these new branches of pinched black holes appear , unfortunately with our methods we can not determine if they will have larger or lower entropy in the phase diagram @xmath281 vs. @xmath15 at fixed total mass .",
    "this would require going beyond linear order in perturbation theory .",
    "we have limited our study to _ stationary _ perturbations and therefore we can not claim to have found an unstable mode , i.e. , a linear perturbation ( satisfying our boundary conditions ) that grows exponentially with time ; we have only found the stationary zero - modes that signal the onset of the instability . including time - dependence is not conceptually difficult but it is only technically harder . as pointed out in footnote [ foot : timedep ] , consistency of requires turning on extra components of the perturbed metric .",
    "this problem is however of fundamental interest since its solution would provide a definite proof of the ultraspinning instability together with information on its timescale .",
    "the analogous stability problem , including time - dependence , was studied in @xcite in the context of odd - dimensional mp black holes with equal angular momenta in all rotation planes . there , the analogue of the @xmath251 zero - mode is also present , and the time - dependent analysis confirmed the absence of a black hole instability in this sector .",
    "we take this result as good evidence in support of a similar interpretation in the singly - spinning case .",
    "the @xmath37 case is special .",
    "as @xcite already pointed out , the @xmath37 singly - spinning mp black hole does not have an ultraspinning regime ( in the sense of subsection [ subsec : ultrathermo ] ) and therefore a priori there is no argument that suggests the existence of an instability within the class of perturbations that preserve the isometries of the background . in this paper",
    "we have confirmed this picture since in @xmath37 we only found one negative mode ( the @xmath273 branch ) which has @xmath129 for all values of @xmath32 such that @xmath282 .",
    "the @xmath50 case has already been discussed in @xcite .",
    "an interesting open question to be addressed is whether the ultraspinning instability is also present in mp black holes in ads",
    ". this background might introduce new features and physics that deserve a study .",
    "in particular , ads might exhibit new black hole phases with an interesting interpretation in the holographic dual field theory .",
    "in fact , pinched plasma balls @xcite , new kinds of deformed plasma tubes @xcite and rotating plasma ball instabilities @xcite have been found in the context of scherk - schwarz - ads .",
    "the spectral methods that we have employed can also be applied in ads spacetimes ( see @xcite for an application in @xmath50 ) .",
    "the existence of an ultraspinning regime is not unique to mp black holes .",
    "for instance , the five - dimensional black rings also admit a certain ultraspinning regime .",
    "namely , in the limit of arbitrarily large angular momentum the black ring resembles a boosted black string @xcite , which is known to suffer from gl instabilities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the arguments in @xcite suggest that black rings should suffer from this gl instability for relatively low values of the angular momentum .",
    "although these gl modes would break the symmetries of the background , it is interesting to ask whether there are zero - modes which can be captured by our methods .",
    "in fact , black rings are expected to suffer from other types of instabilities .",
    "for instance , fat rings are expected to be unstable under changes of their radius @xcite , and doubly - spinning black rings are conjectured to suffer from similar instabilities as well as from superradiant instabilities associated to the rotation along @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "rotating asymptotically flat black holes can also suffer from instabilities which break the axisymmetry .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a remarkable fully non - linear numerical evolution of a perturbed singly - spinning mp solution in @xmath283 and found that these black holes are dynamically unstable against _ non_-axisymmetric bar - mode perturbations .",
    "the endpoint of this instability ( at least in the regime of rotations explored in @xcite ) seems to be another mp black hole with a smaller angular momentum .",
    "notice however that , because the axisymetry is broken , the threshold of the instability is not expected to be stationary , and thus there will be no bifurcation to a new stationary family of black holes .",
    "the existence of such an instability had been conjectured also by emparan and myers in @xcite using a thermodynamic argument of a different type to the one explored in the current manuscript .",
    "this bar - mode instability is certainly different in nature from the axisymmetric instability , which is not present in the @xmath37 case .",
    "moreover , the bar - mode instability becomes active at slightly lower rotations : compare the critical values of @xmath237 for the onset of the bar instability in table 1 of @xcite with the critical values of @xmath237 for the onset of the ultraspinning instability in our table [ table : critrot ] .",
    "it would be certainly very interesting to study also the non - linear time evolution of the axisymmetric ultraspinning instability .",
    "in addition , in the presence of certain matter or a cosmological constant , rotating or charged black holes ( including the kerr solution ) can be unstable due to the superradiant phenomena @xcite . consider a black hole with angular velocity @xmath157 ( or with chemical potential @xmath284 ) . if the frequency @xmath285 and the angular momentum @xmath286 ( or charge @xmath287 ) of a scattering wave satisfy the relation @xmath288 ( or @xmath289 ) , the scattering is superradiant : the wave extracts rotational energy ( or electromagnetic energy ) from the background and gets amplified .",
    "the presence of an effective reflective potential barrier , which may be due to the mass in a massive scalar field case or due to the ads gravitational potential , combined with superradiance can then lead to multiple wave amplification and reflection that renders the system unstable .",
    "this can occur for scalar , electromagnetic or gravitational ( but not fermionic ) waves .",
    "such an unstable system is often coined as a  black hole bomb \" @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to determine the endpoint of this superradiant instability @xcite and there is active ongoing research in this direction @xcite .",
    "the spectral methods might also be useful to tackle this problem .",
    "returning back to smarr s expectation of an instability in rotating black holes based on an analogy between rotating black holes and fluid droplets @xcite , it is interesting that it is realised in higher dimensions with the ultraspinning instability . that this happens is no longer seen as a mere analogy but a consequence of the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "black holes are thermodynamic objects and as such one should expect that , in a long wavelength regime ( compared to the energy scale set by the temperature ) , they should have an effective hydrodynamic description . the first attempt to materialize",
    "this idea was the membrane paradigm @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ads / cft duality motivated further research in this direction which culminated with the formulation of the fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite , which provides a precise hydrodynamic description of asymptotically large ads black holes . in addition , we should mention the blackfold approach of @xcite which also provides a hydrodynamic description of _ asymptotically flat _ black holes in the regime where this approximation applies . in both latter cases ,",
    "the formal connection between gravity and fluid dynamics is established through a derivative expansion of the einstein equations .    in this context , it is therefore with no surprise that many of the aforementioned black hole instabilities have an hydrodynamic description .",
    "the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite of black strings is in correspondence with the rayleigh - plateau instability in fluid tubes @xcite and with damped unstable sound wave oscillations @xcite .",
    "the subject of our study , the ultraspinning instability and the associated new phases of pinched stationary black holes , also possesses a fluid description as ultraspinning pinched plasma balls @xcite .",
    "finally , the bar mode non - axisymmetric instability @xcite was also conjectured to exist in black holes due to its presence in rotating fluids @xcite .",
