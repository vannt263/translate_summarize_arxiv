    "circinus x-1 ( cir x-1 ) is a low - mass x - ray binary and microquasar , containing a young neutron star with an orbital period about its companion of @xmath116.6 days@xcite .",
    "its highly relativistic jets ( apparent velocity @xmath2 12)@xcite are resolved in both radio and x - ray wavelengths@xcite and interact with the interstellar medium ( ism ) to create arcminute - scale synchrotron x - ray lobes@xcite and a 5@xmath3 diameter radio nebula surrounding cir x-1@xcite . given the evidence of multi - tev particle acceleration in the region , cir x-1 is a good candidate for tev gamma - ray ( @xmath4-ray ) emission , however no tev @xmath4-ray emission has been seen with h.e.s.s .",
    "( 28 hrs)@xcite .",
    "our observations of the molecular gas towards cir x-1 aim to provide insights into the physics of jet / ism interactions on parsec ( pc ) scales , assess the potential of cir x-1 as a cosmic - ray accelerator and provide additional constraints on its distance , which is ambiguous at 4 - 12 kpc .",
    "westerlund 2 is a young ( 1 - 3 myr ) and rich stellar cluster containing ongoing star formation and over two dozen high mass stars , including two wolf - rayet stars ; and ionizes the nearby giant hii region rcw 49 .",
    "interesting arc- and jet - like features seen in nanten @xmath0co data@xcite towards the cluster may be an indication of relativistic particle acceleration in the region and may have a common origin with coincident tev @xmath4-ray source hess j1023 - 575@xcite . given the uncertainty in the origin of the tev source and its link to the cluster , arc - jet feature and nearby pulsar psr j1022 - 5746 , a detailed picture of the dense and disrupted gas in this region is needed .",
    "the area towards cir x-1 was mapped in the @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) line as part of the nanten galactic plane survey@xcite .",
    "follow - up observations with the mopra radio telescope targeted tracers of denser and disrupted gas and were conducted in february 2012 in the 7 mm band and january 2010 , february 2010 and april 2011 in the 12 mm band with a resultant t@xmath5 of 0.1 k and 0.07 k respectively . towards westerlund 2 , observations in the 12 mm band were conducted in january 2012 and were comprised of three 30@xmath630@xmath3 and one 10@xmath610@xmath3 mapping region to result in full coverage of the hii region , tev emission and molecular arc - jet feature .",
    "the 7 mm observations were conducted in april 2012 and had coverage as seen in fig .",
    "the t@xmath5 was @xmath10.08 k per channel in all cases .",
    "the observations with the mopra radio telescope in the 7 and 12 mm bands and data reduction were conducted as in ref .  .",
    "towards cir x-1 , three distinct @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) peaks @xmath7 4@xmath8 are seen in nanten data ( see fig .  [ f1]d ) .",
    "the molecular mass , obtained from x - factor conversion between integrated co intensity and h@xmath9 column density , and average density of each peak within a 2.5@xmath3 radius circle encompassing the radio nebula towards cir x-1 is @xmath110@xmath10 m@xmath11 ( d/10kpc)@xmath12 and @xmath1100 @xmath13 ( d/10kpc)@xmath14 respectively for each peak . the cloud at @xmath1575 km / s ( see fig .  [",
    "f1]a ) appears to flank supernova remnant ( snr ) g321.9 - 0.3 and is broad (  20 km / s fwhm ) , indicating the gas may be disrupted by the snr which is at 5.5 - 6 kpc . the cloud at @xmath1530 km / s ( see fig .  [",
    "f1]b ) is part of a large gas feature , @xmath10.3@xmath16x0.8@xmath16 , towards the centre of which we observe emission from cs(j=1 - 0 ) , h@xmath9o and nh@xmath17(1,1 ) , indicating core densities @xmath7 10@xmath18 @xmath13 ; and coincides with extended green object ( ego ) and likely massive young stellar outflow region g321.94 - 0.01@xcite .",
    "the cloud at 10 km / s ( see fig .",
    "[ f1]c ) overlapping cir x-1 is narrow and localised to its vicinity .",
    "there is a possible faint ( 3@xmath8 ) detection of nh@xmath17(1,1 ) at this velocity ( see fig .  [",
    "f1]d ) .",
    "two narrow , @xmath13 km / s fwhm , peaks of cs(j=1 - 0 ) emission were seen towards westerlund 2 , indicating gas densities in those regions of @xmath710@xmath10 @xmath13 .",
    "a peak of 0.31 k ( 5.8@xmath8 ) at @xmath13 km / s is coincident with a dense component of giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) located at 1.2 - 8.7 km / s and believed to be one of the two parent gmcs of westerlund 2 ( fig .",
    "it is 2.7 pc in radius ( d/5.4 kpc ) and has a virial mass between 1.5x10@xmath19 and 5.5x10@xmath19 m@xmath11 .",
    "the other peak of 0.26 k ( 7.5 @xmath8 ) is seen in the arc , which coincides precisely with the peak of the co emission and is at the same velocity range ( @xmath124 - 28 km / s ) ( see fig .  [",

    "emission from radio recombination lines ( rrls ) h62@xmath21 ( fig .",

    "it shows a morphological correspondence to the radio continuum emission and appears to be centred between the two wolf - rayet stars of the westerlund 2 cluster .",
    "the emission in all three lines is broad ( @xmath145 km / s fwhm ) and peaks at @xmath10 km / s .",
    "the ambiguity in associating peaks in the @xmath0co emission to cir x-1 as well as the non - detection of any other molecular line emission has not enabled us to gain insights into the interaction between the relativistic jets and the ism , nor to constrain the distance to cir x-1 .",
    "we tentatively associate the molecular gas located at 10 km / s with cir x-1 , and that at @xmath1575 km / s with snr g321.9 - 0.3 .",
    "ego g321.94 - 0.01 has been associated with @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) , cs(1 - 0 ) , h@xmath9o and nh@xmath17(1,1 ) emission at @xmath1530 km / s .",
    "molecular cloud masses of the order of @xmath110@xmath10 m@xmath11 towards cir x-1 make @xmath4-ray production likely given the jet energetics , and warrants deeper h.e.s.s observations .",
    "two peaks of cs are seen towards westerlund 2 , providing evidence of dense gas towards both the jet feature and a parent molecular cloud of the cluster , either of which may be associated with the high energy emission in the region .",
    "rrl emission highlights the extent of the partially ionised gas in the hii region rcw 49 .",
    "the mopra radio telescope is part of the australia telescope national facility which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
