    "in the kinetic theory of gases , the dynamics of a non - ionized monatomic rarefied gas system is described by the celebrated boltzmann equation .",
    "but numerical approximation of the boltzmann dynamics is a formidable challenge due mainly to the complicated structure of the collision operator .",
    "many good numerical techniques have been developed to this end , but often they lead to time consuming computations .",
    "to circumvent these difficulties , bhatnagar , gross and krook @xcite , and independently welander @xcite , proposed a simplified model for the boltzmann equation where the collision operator was replaced by a relaxation operator : @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3-dimensional torus and @xmath4 is the collision frequency . although the collision frequency takes various forms depending on hypotheses imposed in the derivation of the model @xcite , we assume in this paper that it is a fixed constant for simplicity . @xmath5 denotes the local maxwellian constructed from the velocity moments of the distribution function @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 the bgk model ( [ main.1 ] ) is computationally less expensive than the boltzmann equation since it is sufficient to update the macroscopic fields in each time step . on the other hand",
    ", it provides qualitatively correct solutions for the macroscopic moments in fluid regime .",
    "these two aspects , namely , the relatively low computational cost and the correct description of hydrodynamic limit , explain the interest in the bgk model and its variations over the last decades",
    ". it also shares important features with the original boltzmann equation , such as the conservation laws and the dissipation of entropy : @xmath9 and @xmath10 the local conservation laws ( [ conservationlaw ] ) leads to a system of hydrodynamic type equations .",
    "@xmath11 there are extensive literatures on various topics of the bgk model . for mathematical analysis , we refer to @xcite . for numerical computations ,",
    "since there are too many of them , we do not attempt to present a complete set of references . see @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , a semi - lagrangian scheme was proposed and tested successfully for various flow problems arising in gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "the first order version of the method can be written down as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the local maxwellian defined by @xmath14 the precise definitions of each terms will be given in later sections .",
    "the main feature of the scheme is that even though the relaxation operator is treated implicitly , computations can be performed explicitly by exploiting the approximate conservation laws in a very clever way .",
    "( see section 2 ) .",
    "therefore , ( [ mainscheme_introduction ] ) enjoys the stability property of implicit schemes and the low computational cost of explicit schemes at the same time .",
    "moreover , the semi - lagrangian treatment of the transport part enables one to perform the computation over a wide range of cfl numbers . in this paper",
    ", we study the convergence issue of this scheme and derive an explicit estimate of the convergence rate measured in a weighted @xmath0 space .",
    "as far as we know , this seems to be the first result on the strong convergence of a fully discretized scheme for nonlinear collisional kinetic equations .",

    "<S> recently , a new class of semi - lagrangian methods for the bgk model of the boltzmann equation has been introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods work in a satisfactory way either in rarefied or fluid regime . moreover , because of the semi - lagrangian feature , the stability property is not restricted by the cfl condition . </S>",
    "<S> these aspects make them very attractive for practical applications . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the convergence properties of the method and prove that the discrete solution of the scheme converges in a weighted @xmath0 norm to the unique smooth solution by deriving an explicit error estimate .    </S>",
