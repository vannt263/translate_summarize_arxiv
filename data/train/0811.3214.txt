    "in the standard @xmath4cdm paradigm of structure formation , dark matter over - densities accrete mass , forming deep potential wells into which baryons condense and cool to eventually form stars .",
    "the details of the cooling and star formation process are quite complex , and the physics of the first episode of star formation and that of subsequent generations is not completely understood . there have been detailed numerical studies of the formation of the first stars which suggest that the masses of these stars were skewed to the massive end @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are challenging owing to the large dynamical range needed as well as the complexities of hydrodynamical modeling required to capture the essential physics .",
    "current models of galaxy formation in the early universe are able to make some simplifying assumptions to make the simulations of subsequent star formation easier ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , much work still needs to be done to fully uncover the details of galaxy formation , including a better understanding of the properties of the dark matter halos and how the dark matter properties affect baryonic structure formation .    in numerical simulations , three basic properties of dark matter",
    "are followed : mass , position , and velocity . from these three properties ,",
    "much has been learned about the buildup and assembly of early dark matter halos , including halo mass functions , galaxy clustering , halo shapes , and halo spins @xcite .",
    "refinement in our understanding of dark matter halos is needed to gain insight into how the baryonic component of galaxies couples with the dark matter ( e.g. , angular momentum transfer , stellar and agn feedback ) .",
    "a key missing piece is the role of angular momentum in the formation and modulation of structure formation .",
    "this paper focuses on the angular momentum and clustering properties of dark matter halos in the early ( @xmath5 ) univers , roughly @xmath6 gyr after the big bang in the concordance model .",
    "the goal of this work is to understand more about the early , low mass dark matter halos that likely host the earliest stars and galaxies in a statistically large sample .",
    "in the standard @xmath4cdm paradigm , angular momentum is acquired by dark matter halos due to tidal torquing by their neighbors @xcite . during the linear phases of proto - galactic evolution the angular momentum grows to first order in proportion to time @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite found from the study of collapsing spherical regions that the growth in the angular momentum @xmath8 occurs in the second order only as @xmath9 . in such regions growth occurs purely as a result of convective effects on the bounding surface .",
    "this was calculated using linear theory to find the growth rate of the angular momentum within a co - moving spherical region of an expanding einstein de - sitter universe .",
    "@xcite showed that while the angular momentum of a proto - galaxy did grow @xmath10 for a flat universe , the peebles result was a consequence of the imposed spherical symmetry and was verified numerically by @xcite .",
    "we briefly outline the process of angular momentum acquisition by a dark matter halo in what follows .",
    "consider the growth of fluctuations in an expanding friedmann universe filled with pressureless matter with density , @xmath11 , and let @xmath12 the local over - density can be written as a separable function of time and a co - moving coordinate @xmath13 related to @xmath14 by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cosmological expansion factor .",
    "the trajectory of a dust particle in linear theory is given by : @xmath17   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the lagrangian coordinate defined as the @xmath13 position of the particle as @xmath19 and @xmath20 the peculiar gravitational potential .",
    "if @xmath21 , a condition that is satisfied over the period of time preceding the collapse only when the initial density field has a coherence length of the proto - galactic scale . in general , this will cease to describe the detailed evolution of the matter distribution long before galaxies form .",
    "the spin angular momentum of the material that makes up a proto - galaxy can be written as , @xmath22 since the leading term in @xmath23 is first order and is parallel to @xmath13 , the 2nd order term gives the non - zero contribution to the above integral .",
    "writing it explicitly as an integral over the surface ( using gauss s theorem ) , we have : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the tidal tensor and describes the local deformation at @xmath18 and @xmath26 is the inertia tensor of the matter in @xmath27 .",
    "this tensor product is used to calculate the tidal torque on an extended body in the tidal field .",
    "angular momentum is acquired as the first order tidal field couples to the zeroth order quadrupole moment of the irregular boundary of the proto - galaxy .",
    "the principal axes in general do not coincide as @xmath25 defines the shape and disposition of the neighboring perturbations and @xmath26 depends only on the shape of the proto - galaxy .",
    "this outlines in principle the origin and offers insight into the calculation of angular momentum of simulated dark matter halos .",
    "we ran a series of n - body simulations to follow the growth of dark matter halos from @xmath28 down to @xmath29 . in order to study halos that likely host pop iii stars",
    ", we chose the particle mass such that a @xmath2 dark matter halo would have @xmath30 100 particles . for @xmath31 particles , this requirement sets the box size at @xmath32 and the particle mass at @xmath33 .",
    "the initial conditions were generated using a parallelized version of grafic @xcite , which calculates the gaussian random field for the dark matter particles .",
    "we used gadget-2 @xcite to follow dark matter particles down to a redshift of @xmath29 , with output snapshots at @xmath34 .",
    "we used the wmap3 @xcite cosmological parameters for the runs presented here , [",
    "@xmath35 = [ 0.238 , 0.762 , 0.0416 , 0.732 , 0.958 , 0.761 ] .    for each snapshot",
    ", we used a friends - of - friends code to find individual halos , using a linking length of @xmath36 times the initial particle spacing .",
    "once the halos were identified , each particle in the halo was tested to see if it was actually bound to the halo .",
    "we used skid @xcite to do the unbinding .",
    "skid finds the potential and kinetic energies for all particles in a given halo and removes the most unbound particle from the halo .",
    "successive iterations are performed until all particles are either bound or there are no more particles in the halo . without unbinding , there was excess power in both tails of the spin distribution .",
    "once unbound particles were removed , for each halo that had more than @xmath37 dark matter particles , we calculated the dimensionless spin parameter,@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total angular momentum , @xmath40 the total energy ( kinetic plus potential ) , and @xmath41 the total mass of the halo . for the most massive halos , with more than @xmath42 particles",
    ", we used the hierarchical force calculator treecode v1.4 @xcite to get the potential energy , inducing an error of @xmath43 in the potential energy as compared to direct summation .",

    "* e.g. , ) , the distribution is log - normal , with a slight excess at low spin values . at @xmath45",
    ", @xcite also found a log - normal distribution , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while we find @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the same redshift .",
    "these differences may be due to the increased resolution , volume , and number of particles in our study .",
    "in addition , @xcite used a different halo finding algorithm ( skid s density maxima finder ) , and found a press - schecter mass function .",
    "however , our mass function matches the @xcite modification to the sheth - tormen mass function .",
    "finally , the differences between their results and our work may be due to different cosmological parameters chosen , particularly @xmath50 . in future work",
    ", we plan to study the effect of mass resolution on the derived angular momentum properties as well as the effect of changing @xmath50 .",
    "the right column in figure [ lambda_tot ] shows the trend in the mean and standard deviation of the fitted log - normal over redshift .",
    "the error bars show the @xmath51 estimated errors on the mean and standard deviation of the fitted log - normal .",
    "we found only slight variation in the mean spin , with @xmath52 at @xmath53 increasing to @xmath54 at @xmath29 .",
    "the small increase in spin over time is most likely due to stronger tidal torques from more massive halos that collapse at later times .",
    "the standard deviation decreases slightly from @xmath55 at @xmath53 to @xmath56 at @xmath29 .",
    "we show in figure [ lambda_mbin ] the spin distribution for halos with mass within @xmath57 dex of @xmath3 and @xmath2 at the same redshifts as figure [ lambda_tot ] . for the @xmath3 halos ,",
    "we find that @xmath58 does not monotonically increase with redshift as it did for the whole sample , and @xmath58 is systematically larger than the sample mean at any given redshift .",
    "there is also a sharp increase in @xmath58 at @xmath53 , possibly because these halos were still in the process of forming and may have significant infalling mass clumps .",
    "however , there are only 55 halos in this mass bin at @xmath53 , making it difficult to reliably fit the sample with a log - normal curve .",
    "the @xmath2 halos show spin distributions more similar to the entire sample , with a slowly increasing mean spin from @xmath53 to @xmath29 .",
    "we also studied the clustering properties of dark matter halos selected by their angular momentum .",
    "it is well known that more massive halos are strongly clustered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found no correlation between @xmath59 and environment for halos with @xmath60 at @xmath61 , ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this diagnostic is potentially important as a halo of mass @xmath41 with larger angular momentum may take longer to collapse and therefore longer to form stars than a lower spin halo of the same mass .",
    "thus , low spin halos could preferentially host star formation earlier .",
    "this in turn may allow feedback processes such as ionizing photons , stellar winds , and supernovae to become important earlier than in their high spin counterparts .",
    "these are important consequences for galaxy formation , and the detailed role of the spin of the halo on the collapse of baryons will be explored in a subsequent paper .",
    "we calculate the two - point correlation function , @xmath62 , using the standard definition , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of halo - halo pairs within a separation of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 the same for a random distribution , and @xmath68 is the cross - correlation between the data set and the random distribution .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 represents the excess probability of finding a halo at distance @xmath69 compared to a random distribution .",
    "figure [ corr ] shows the correlation function , @xmath62 , for halos grouped by spin parameter for a given mass .",
    "the top panel is for halos with mass @xmath70 , and the bottom panel for @xmath71 halos .",
    "we separated the halos out by mass to delineate the effect of spin from that of mass .",
    "we first computed the overall correlation function for all halos in the given mass range , and then used two sub - samples based on their spin parameter .",
    "the cuts in spin parameter were chosen so that one third of the halos were in the high and low spin bins respectively .",
    "the error bars show poisson errors in @xmath64 , @xmath72 when counting halo pairs for the spin cut samples , we employed two methods .",
    "first , we counted only pairs where both halos were in the given bin , and these results are shown in figure [ corr ] .",
    "we also counted the pairs where only one halo was in the high or low spin bin .",
    "this method of counting produced similar results as the first method .",
    "we find that there is a distinction in the correlation function when the data are separated by the spin parameter .",
    "high spin halos are more strongly clustered than low spin halos , similar to the result found by @xcite in the millennium simulation .",
    "we also find that the difference in clustering is preserved over a range of redshifts .",
    "the excess clustering is due to the fact that in a denser environment , halos feel stronger tidal torques , and thus have larger angular momentum and spin parameters .",
    "the correlation function can be fit to a power - law , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the correlation length .",
    "we find the high spin halos have a correlation length on average @xmath75 larger than the low spin halos over the various mass and redshift slices used here .",
    "the slope , @xmath76 , did not show any correlation with spin , mass , or redshift .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the angular momentum distribution of simulated high redshift dark matter halos and their correlation functions .",
    "while the angular momentum distributions for this population are well fit by log - normal distributions as is the case for lower redshift and more massive halos , we find that the clustering properties of the high redshift population depend on the value of spin .",
    "for a given mass bin selecting by spin , we find that the correlation function is higher for high spin halos .",
    "this is an important trend and appears to be robust .",
    "although in this study we have restricted ourselves to the analysis of dark matter only simulations , the different correlation lengths of high and low spin halos are likely to have an important impact in feedback from these early galaxies .",
    "pop iii stars appear to have a large impact on their environment due to radiative @xcite and supernova @xcite feedback .",
    "we note here that in a recent paper @xcite tracked the spin parameters of halos that formed the first stars in 12 cosmological random realizations and did not find a correlation between halo spin and collapse time .",
    "the resolution and analysis pursued by them differ from ours as they zoom in and track ( by explicit selection ) the properties of the dark matter halo that hosts the first star .",
    "our analysis is distinct by construction as we are measuring the spin parameters of an ensemble of dark matter halos and arguing that the higher spin halos might in general commence the collapse and formation of its first star later . as shown in figure [ lambda_mbin ] , the distribution of halo spin for the high mass bin at @xmath53",
    "is shifted to higher spins when compared to the general population .",
    "thus , the larger halos that would host pop iii stars will have larger spins , but the largest spin that @xcite followed was for @xmath77 , which is at the half - max of the log - normal fit .",
    "one halo with this spin may not be representative of all high spin , massive halos , which may show a delayed baryonic collapse . while this is beyond the scope of this paper , we intend to pursue the consequences of our results for baryonic collapse .",
    "our results are in agreement with what @xcite found for the correlation of dark matter halos at @xmath78 in the millenium run . @xcite found trends in the sdss spectroscopic sample of local galaxies relating the estimated dark matter spin parameter with the galaxy s baryonic properties , such as stellar mass and recent star formation histories .",
    "thus , angular momentum may be a key to determining the epoch of formation , size , and structure of the stellar and gaseous disks in galaxies . in the early universe",
    "however , it remains unclear how much effect angular momentum will have on the first generation of galaxy formation , although our results are suggestive .",
    "the authors are grateful for the prompt and thoughtful comments of the referee , and for time allocation on two of yale s super - computing clusters , bulldog a and bulldog h. a. j. d. is grateful for many helpful discussions with jason tumlinson and kyoung - soo lee ."
