    "this scenario means the physical processes behind agn - galaxy coevolution can be revealed by the simple question : _ are agn host galaxies special ? _    in seminal work @xcite used @xmath7120,000 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",

    "studies of agn host galaxies using large samples with x - ray @xcite , infrared @xcite , and radio @xcite agn selection found a similar observed preference for massive and bulge - dominated hosts , with infrared @xmath8 x - ray @xmath8 radio corresponding to a sequence in declining star formation rate ( sfr ) in the host galaxy @xcite . taken together",

    "because @xmath18 is correlated with galaxy bulge mass @xmath19 , which is in turn correlated with total stellar mass @xmath20 , a given agn flux limit means it is easier to find lower-@xmath21 agns in high - mass galaxies than in low - mass galaxies .",

    "the strong `` star formation dilution '' in low - mass star - forming hosts means that , at fixed eddington ratio , many fewer agns are identified than in massive and low - ssfr host galaxies .",

    "in this appendix we justify the modeling assumptions used in the simulations of section 5 ( and outlined in equations 713 ) by testing other plausible assumptions .",

    "the original `` uniform-@xmath72 '' simulation is also compared with additional simulations that replace the metallicity - dependent nlr ratios with metal - rich ( constant ) nlr ratios , or replace the @xmath2 relation with a constant @xmath86 ratio .",
    "we also test different power - law slopes for the schechter function describing the eddington ratio distribution .",

    "thus the models implicitly assume the same dust extinction for both star - forming galaxies and agns : a plausible assumption , given that the agn nlr gas is at @xmath22kpc scales from the galaxy center @xcite , similar to locations of @xmath0 regions .",
    "we directly compare the dust extinction of bpt - classified agns and non - agns in figure [ fig : comparedust ] , quantified as the excess balmer decrement @xmath213 . here the intrinsic balmer decrement @xmath214 for @xmath0 regions and @xmath215 for agns @xcite . compared to galaxies of the same ( high ) stellar mass ,",

    "the metal - rich nlr assumption uses the same equations as the section 5 simulations ( equations 1012 ) for the other agn nlr line ratios : this means there is no difference between the metallicity - dependent and metal - rich vo87 agn simulations .",
    "we follow the same steps outlined in section 5.2 to create a `` uniform-@xmath72 '' simulation with a metal - rich agn nlr , using the same @xmath139 for bpt agns and @xmath140 for vo87 agns to normalize the eddington ratio distribution and minimize the total @xmath40 in comparing to observations .",
    "this uniform-@xmath72 , metal - rich nlr simulation for bpt agns is compared to observations in the color  mass diagram in figure [ fig : simbpt_colormsig ] .",
    "we additionally test a different relationship between black hole mass and galaxy properties by replacing equation 8 with : @xmath217 with an intrinsic scatter of 0.5  dex .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath192 relation of @xcite , assuming @xmath218 .",
    "@xcite used a similar constant @xmath86 ratio in their study showing that x - ray agns have a uniform eddington ratio distribution over a wide range of host galaxy stellar mass . in the local universe velocity dispersion",
    "correlates with black hole mass much better than does total stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus there is some motivation for comparing a constant @xmath86 ratio with the @xmath2 assumption used in section 5 .",
    "we create a `` uniform-@xmath72 '' simulation with both a metal - rich nlr and a constant @xmath86 ratio following the same steps as in section 5.2 , minimizing the total @xmath40 by setting @xmath219 in both the bpt and vo87 simulations .",

    "thus we are justified in using the metallicity - dependent nlr and @xmath2 relation for our simulations in section 5 .",
    "the simulations in sections 5 and 6 used a schechter form of the eddington ratio distribution ( equation 7 ) with a power - law slope @xmath114 .",
    "observations of x - ray and narrow - line agns , as well as models for agn fueling , are consistent with this parameterization @xcite , but neither are strongly constraining due to their considerable uncertainties .",
    "other observations suggest a somewhat shallower power - law slope : @xcite argue that @xmath115 better describes the observed @xmath221sfr correlation , and @xcite measure @xmath116 for low - redshift broad - line agns . here",

    "the fit to the observed agn fractions is significantly worse than the fiducial @xmath114 used in sections 5 and 6 , with @xmath40 values @xmath71.5@xmath224 higher , as shown in table [ tbl : simchi2 ] .",
    "the uniform-@xmath72 simulation with a `` flat '' @xmath116 eddington ratio distribution is compared to the observations in figure [ fig : simbpt_flater ] .",
    "normalizing the flat @xmath72 distribution requires a very low minimum eddington ratio : @xmath225 for bpt agns and @xmath226 for vo87 agns .",
    "the @xmath40 values for the @xmath116 distribution are roughly double those of the fiducial @xmath114 eddington ratio distribution ( see table [ tbl : simchi2 ] ) , with a higher - amplitude `` striping '' pattern of residuals in the color - mass diagram . for a uniform eddington ratio distribution in all host galaxy types ,",

    "<S> we use 317,000 emission - line galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey to investigate line - ratio selection of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . in particular , we demonstrate that `` star formation dilution '' by @xmath0 regions causes a significant bias against agn selection in low - mass , blue , star - forming , disk - dominated galaxies . this bias is responsible for the observed preference of agns among high - mass , green , moderately star - forming , bulge - dominated hosts </S>",
    "<S> . we account for the bias and simulate the intrinsic population of emission - line agns using a physically - motivated eddington ratio distribution , intrinsic agn narrow line region line ratios , a luminosity - dependent @xmath1}}}$ ] bolometric correction , and the observed @xmath2 relation . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations indicate that , in massive ( @xmath3 ) galaxies , agn accretion is correlated with specific star formation rate but is otherwise uniform with stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> there is some hint of lower black hole occupation in low - mass ( @xmath4 ) hosts , although our modeling is limited by uncertainties in measuring and interpreting the velocity dispersions of low - mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of star formation dilution means that agns contribute little to the observed strong optical emission lines ( e.g. , @xmath5}}}$ ] and @xmath6 ) in low - mass and star - forming hosts . </S>",
    "<S> however the agn population recovered by our modeling indicates that feedback by typical ( low- to moderate - accretion ) low - redshift agns has nearly uniform efficiency at all stellar masses , star formation rates , and morphologies . taken together </S>",
    "<S> , our characterization of the observational bias and resultant agn occupation function suggest that agns are unlikely to be the dominant source of star formation quenching in galaxies , but instead are fueled by the same gas which drives star formation activity . </S>"
