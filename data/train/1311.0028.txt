    "studying the distribution of zeros of orthogonal polynomials is a classical theme that has been addressed in an enormous number of research papers .",
    "the sole reason for revisiting this topic here is the crucial role of _ legendre - gauss - lobatto ( lgl ) grids _ , formed by the zeros of corresponding orthogonal polynomials , for the development of efficient preconditioners for high order finite element and even spectral discretizations of pdes , see e.g. @xcite . in connection with elliptic pdes , which often possess very smooth solutions and thus render high order methods at least potentially extremely efficient , a key constituent is the fact that interpolation at lgl grids give rise to fully robust ( with respect to the polynomial degrees ) isomorphisms between high order polynomial spaces and low order finite element spaces on lgl grids .",
    "however , unfortunately , one quickly faces some serious obstructions to fully exploiting this remarkable potential of lgl grids when simultaneously trying to exploit the flexibility of _ discontinuous galerkin _",
    "( dg ) schemes , namely locally refined grids and locally varying polynomial degrees . indeed , as explained in @xcite , the essential source of the problems encountered then is the fact that lgl grids are _ not nested_. this affects the choice and analysis of suitable _ auxiliary spaces _",
    ", when using the auxiliary space method , see e.g. @xcite as preconditioning strategy , as well as the efficient solution of the corresponding auxiliary problems . as a crucial remedy , certain hierarchies of nested _ dyadic _ grids have been introduced in @xcite which are _ associated _ in a certain sense with lgl grids .",
    "the term `` associated '' encapsulates a number of properties of such dyadic grids , some of which have been used and claimed in @xcite but will be proved here which is the central objective of this paper .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . after collecting , for the convenience of the reader , in section  [ sect :",
    "ultraspherical ] some classical facts and tools used in the sequel , we formulate in section  [ sect : main ] the main results of the paper .",
    "the first one , theorem  [ thm : a ] , is concerned with the quasi - uniformity of lgl grids as well as with a certain notion of equivalence between lgl grids of _ different _ order . this is important for dealing with dg - discretizations involving locally varying polynomial degrees , see @xcite .",
    "the second one , theorem  [ thm : b ] , concerns certain hierarchies of nested dyadic grids that are associated in a very strong sense with lgl grids .",
    "both theorems play a crucial role for the design and analysis of preconditioners for dg systems . section  [ sect : proofa ] is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thm : a ] .",
    "this requires deriving a number of _ refined properties _ of lgl grids which to our knowledge can not be found in the literature .",
    "in particular , we need to revisit in section  [ sect : cgl ] some close relatives namely _ chebyshev - gauss - lobatto ( cgl ) nodes _ since they have explicit formulae that help deriving sharp estimates .",
    "the central subject of section  [ sect : dyadic ] is the generation of dyadic grids associated in a certain way with a given other grid as well as the analysis of the properties of these dyadic grids .",
    "in particular , the results obtained in this section lead to a specific hierarchy for which the properties claimed in theorem  [ thm : b ] are verified .    throughout the paper",
