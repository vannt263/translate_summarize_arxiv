    "the electromagnetic portion of high energy air showers is governed by bremsstrahlung and pair production .",
    "although the formulae for these process have been around for over 60 years , it is not well known that , in many situations , these formulae can be very wrong .",
    "the medium in which the bremsstrahlung or pair production occurs can drastically affect the cross sections . this contribution will discuss four different ways in which the medium can reduce the bremsstrahlung and pair creation cross sections .",
    "these suppression mechanisms can affect air showers by increasing the effective radiation length , lengthening the showers , and moving the position of the shower maximum deeper into the atmosphere . for ground based arrays like the proposed auger observatory , even a small change in the depth of shower max can affect the energy hitting the ground , especially for non - vertical showers where shower maximum is considerably above ground level .",
    "air fluorescence detectors like flys eye and the proposed owl can measure the shower profile , and so their energy measurement would be less affected by unforeseen changes in the shower development .",
    "however , a change in the position of shower maximum can affect measurements of the composition of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "moreover , these mechanisms will drastically reduce the number of particles in the early stages of the shower , changing the shower development profile .",
    "suppression mechanisms for bremsstrahlung and pair production are possible because of the unusual kinematics in these processes . for ultrarelativistic particles ,",
    "the momentum transfer between the radiating electron or converting photon and the target nucleus is very small , especially in the longitudinal direction@xcite . for bremsstrahlung where @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron momenta before and after the interaction respectively , @xmath5 is the photon energy , @xmath6 is the electron mass and @xmath7 . for ultrarelativistic electrons",
    ", @xmath8 can be very small .",
    "for example , for a 1 eev electron emitting a 100 pev photon , @xmath9ev / c . because @xmath8 is so small , by the uncertainty principle , it must take place over a long distance , known as the formation length : @xmath10 for the above example , @xmath11 is 200 meters ; for a 1 pev photon from the same electron , @xmath11 rises to 20 km .",
    "this distance is the distance required for the electron and photon to separate to become distinct particles .",
    "it is also the path length over which the emission amplitude adds coherently to produce the emission probability .",
    "if something happens to the electron or nascent photon while it is traversing the formation zone , then the coherence can be disrupted , reducing the effective formation length and hence the emission probability .",
    "even weak forces , acting over a long formation length , can be strong enough to destroy the coherence required for emission .",
    "the mechanisms discussed here work by disrupting the electron or photon , reducing the effective formation length .",
    "multiple scattering can cause disruption by changing the electron trajectory . if , taken over @xmath11 , the electron multiple scatters by an angle larger than the typical bremsstrahlung emission angle @xmath12 , then emission can be suppressed@xcite .",
    "the reduction can be calculated by considering the effect multiple scattering has on @xmath8 ; as the electron changes direction , it s forward velocity is reduced , and , with it , producing a change in @xmath8 .",
    "this can be modelled by dividing the multiple scattering evenly between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . then",

    "a similar effect occurs for pair production , where the produced electron and positron can multiple scatter .",

    "symmetric pairs are suppressed the most ; in the extremely high energy limit , one of the produced electrons takes almost all of the photon energy .",
    "so , where the lpm effect is extremely strong , an electromagnetic shower becomes a succession of interactions where an electron emits a bremsstrahlung photon that takes almost all of the electrons energy , followed by a very asymmetric pair conversion , producing an electron or positron with almost all of the energy of the initial lepton .",
    "two metrics for suppression effects in showers are the electron energy loss ( @xmath56 ) and photon conversion cross section .",
    "[ compare ] shows how these two markers change with energy in a lead target . as the particle energy rises above @xmath22 ( 2.2 tev for lead ) , the energy loss and conversion cross section fall , with bremsstrahlung affected at lower energies than pair conversion .",

    "several calculations have showed that , the non - gaussian tail of large angle coulomb scatters introduces additional term into the cross section ; in the limit of large suppression@xcite @xmath57 this will reduce the magnitude of suppression in extreme conditions .",
    "inelastic interactions , involving the atomic electrons should be treated separatedly from the elastic nuclear interactions , and a different potential should be used@xcite .",

    "should be treated with caution , especially for light targets like air , where the inelastic form factor is important .",
    "dielectric suppression occurs because photons produced in bremsstrahlung can interact with the atomic electrons in the medium by forward compton scattering@xcite .",
    "the photon wave function acquires a phase shift depending on the dielectric constant of the medium @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the plasma frequency of the medium . with this substitution , the photon momentum ( @xmath61 ) in eq .",

    "@xmath79 is 1.6 pev in water or ice , and 42  pev for air at sea level .",
    "the @xmath79s are so similar because the variation in @xmath17 and @xmath60 partially offset each other . in sea level air",
    ", the window is 331 mev@xmath80 ( with @xmath81 in ev ) .",
    "there should be a similar effect where a partially produced electron or positron emits a bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "this possibility limits the coherence over @xmath11 .",
    "the strength of this suppression has not yet been calculated , but it should be comparable to that for pair production suppressing bremsstrahlung .",
    "this approach is overly simplistic .",
    "the hard cutoff in @xmath19 should be replaced by a probabilistic approach , where the photon interaction probability depends on the distance travelled . and",
    ", other suppression mechanisms will also be in effect , the radiation length will be longer than the naive @xmath82 .",
    "an accurate calculation should include the interplay between the two reactions to arrive at an overall effective shower distance .",
    "still , the above equation gives a reasonable estimate of when this effect needs to be considered .",
    "[ ssummary ] summarizes these results , and shows that a simple bremsstrahlung photon spectrum can have several different slopes for different photon energies .",
    "an external magnetic field can also suppress bremsstrahlung and pair creation . the bending caused by an external field",
    "acts just as does multiple scattering .",
    "the difference is that the magnetic field bending is quite deterministic , while the scattering angles are randomly distributed .",
    "the magnetic bending angle is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the magnetic field and @xmath85 is the angle between the field and the electron trajectory .",
    "emission is reduced if @xmath86 ; this happens for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the critical field strength@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the suppression can be found using an approach similar to that used by landau and pomeranchuk for multiple scattering .",
    "because @xmath89 , while @xmath90 the energy dependence is different",
    ". with the definition @xmath91 , the suppression factor is@xcite @xmath92^{2/3}.\\ ] ] a magnetic field will also bend pair produced electrons and positrons .",
    "the same equation holds , except that @xmath93 replaces @xmath18 . for a particle trajectory perpendicular to earth s @xmath94 gauss field , @xmath95 eev",
    "so , for cosmic rays with energies above @xmath96 ev , magnetic suppression must be considered .",
    "besides reducing the interactions rates , these mechanisms also increase the angular spread of electromagnetic showers . when bremsstrahlung and pair creation occur with a large opening angle , the formation length is shortened . for bremsstrahlung @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the angle between the photon and the electron trajectory .",
    "when @xmath98 is included in the calculations , the average emission angle rises from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath101 is small enough , this spreading can dominate over multiple scattering in determining the angular spreading of the shower . if the scattering is taken over @xmath102 ( assuming 1 interaction per @xmath17 , and half the particles are charged and hence subject to multiple scattering ) , this occurs for roughly @xmath103 .",
    "most calculations of air and water showers do not include this angular spreading .",
    "it is likely to be most important for calculations for radio emission from showers in air and ice@xcite .",
    "suppression mechanisms can affect showers by slowing their development , effectively increasing the radiation length .",
    "because they all work by reducing @xmath19 , the effects do not add ; instead , @xmath8 must be summed , and the total suppression calculated .",
    "usually , multiple scattering is the most significant cause of suppression , so it will be the focus of this section .",
    "the effective increase in radiation length due to multiple scattering can be seen in figs . [",
    "compare ] ; it shows how the area under the curve in figs .",
    "[ brem ] and [ pair ] drops as the incident particle energy rises . for bremsstrahlung",
    ", energy loss is halved for electrons with @xmath104 , while the pair production cross section is halved for @xmath105 .",
    "then , the radiation length in the first generation of the shower doubles ; succeeding generations will show smaller effects .    however , the effects go beyond simply lengthening showers .",
    "because soft photon bremsstrahlung is the first reaction to be affected , the number of interactions will decrease more rapidly then the electron energy loss .",
    "so , the initial part of a shower will consist almost entirely of a few high energy particles , without an accompanying fuzz of lower energy particles .",
    "the initial shower development depends on a much smaller number of interactions .",
    "for example , a 25 gev electron in sea level air will emit about 14 bremsstrahlung photons per @xmath17 , while a @xmath106 ev electron will emit only 3 .",
    "it is worth noting that , these numbers are naturally finite because dielectric suppression eliminates the infrared divergence .",
    "pair production is similar ; the pairs become increasingly asymmetric .",
    "the higher energy lepton from a 25 gev photon pair conversion takes an average of 75% of @xmath5 ; for a @xmath107 ev photon , the average is more than 90% .    because of this , shower to shower fluctuations become much larger .",
    "misaki studied shower development in lead and standard rock .",
    "for @xmath108 he found that the position of shower maximum was shifted to larger depths , and that the position of shower maximum varied greatly from shower to shower , and that the shower to shower variations overshadowed the average shower development@xcite .    in the limit @xmath108 ,",
    "the initial part of an air shower becomes a succession of asymmetric pair production , where the higher energy of the pair loses most of it s energy to a single bremsstrahlung photon , re - starting the process . in short , the paradigm that successive generations of air showers have twice as many particles with half as much energy as the current generation fails completely .",
    "the composition of the highest energy cosmic rays is still a mystery .",
    "this article will consider two possibilities : protons ( the most popular ) and photons . in both cases",
    ", we will take @xmath109 ev as a standard energy . for incoming heavy ions ,",
    "the effects are greatly reduced because of the lower per particle energy , and neutrons can be treated as protons . because these are toy models , the likely possibility of the photon pair converting in the earth s magnetic field will be neglected .",
    "most current works have considered proton initiated showers .",
    "there has been disagreement as to whether the lpm effect is important in air showers .",
    "capdevielle and atallah found that it had a large effect on @xmath107 ev and @xmath96 ev showers@xcite .",
    "however , kalmykov , ostapchenko and pavlov found a much smaller effect ; for a @xmath96 ev incident proton , the number of electrons at shower maximum decreased by 5% , while the position of shower maximum shifted downward by @xmath110 g/@xmath111@xcite . this shift is less than the error on a typical measurement of shower maximum in a single shower , but it can have a significant effect on composition studies .",
    "of course , as experiments probe higher energies , suppression becomes more important .",
    "none of these authors considered the effects of fluctuations or other suppression mechanisms .",
    "air showers studies are complicated by the fact that density , and hence @xmath22 and @xmath79 depend on altitude and temperature .",
    "ignoring temperature changes , pressure decreases exponentially with altitude , with scale height 8.7 km . for showers ,",
    "it is convenient to work with column depth measured in g/@xmath111 . in an isothermal model , then @xmath112 pev@xmath113 ) , where @xmath114 is the column depth and @xmath115 is ground level , 1030 g/@xmath111 .",
    "temperature will modify the relationship ; with a temperature correction this @xmath22 is 2.25 eev at 36 g/@xmath111 ( 1 @xmath17 ) depth , and 1 eev at 90 g/@xmath111 ( 1 hadronic interaction length , @xmath116 ) . neglecting temperature , @xmath117 . for pair creation suppression , @xmath118 pev@xmath119 .",
    "the corresponding photon window is 331 mev @xmath120 .",
    "the two window edges have different @xmath114 dependencies because all three mechanisms have a different dependence on @xmath60 and @xmath17 .",
    "incoming photons react by pair production , while protons interact hadronically .",
    "a central hadronic collision will produce a shower of several hundred pions ; the neutral pions will decay to photons .",
    "the highest energy @xmath121 will have a rapidity near to the incoming proton , and their decay photons will have energies around @xmath122ev .",
    "many diffractive processes , such as @xmath123 production can produce photons with similar energies .",
    "overall , photons from central interaction will have an average energy of about @xmath124 ev .",
    "although a complete monte carlo simulation is required to understand the effects of suppression in air showers , simple calculations can provide some indications where it matters , and should differentiate between the results of capdevielle and atallah and kalmykov and collaborators . because @xmath22 decreases with depth , in concert with the average particle energy ,",
    "suppression mechanisms can actually become stronger as one moves deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "the solid curve in fig . [ airdepth ] shows @xmath22 as a function of altitude .",
    "the dashed curve shows the average particle energy , for an idealized bethe - heitler shower from a @xmath109 ev photon . in each successive radiation length",
    ", there are twice as many particles with half the energy .",
    "the curve with the short dashes shows a similar cascade , from a @xmath122 ev photon starting at @xmath125 .",
    "the electromagnetic interactions at a given depth are determined by the ratio of the two curves , which gives @xmath126 . for the photon case ,",
    "the maximum suppression occurs around 75 g/@xmath111 , where @xmath127 .",
    "electron @xmath56 is reduced about 80% , and pair production cross section is down by 60% ; the radiation length has more than doubled . for the hadronic case , the effect is smaller , and , of course , these high energy photons are only a small portion of the total shower . on the other hand ,",
    "hadronic interactions are only partially inelastic , and the proton may carry a significant fraction of it s momentum deeper in the atmosphere , where suppression is larger . because of the large variations in energy deposition depths , it is difficult to give more quantitative estimates",
    ".    this model underestimates the effect of suppression , because , with suppression shower development is slower than the idealized model , further increasing the amount of suppression in the next stage .",
    "however , it does show that suppression is important in photon shower , and in at least parts of proton initiate showers .",
    "the effect is clearly smaller than that predicted by capdevielle and atallah , but is consistent with kalmykov and collaborators .    beyond the affect on average showers ,",
    "fluctuations must be considered . because the cosmic ray energy spectrum falls as @xmath128",
    ", it is important to understand the tails of the energy resolution distribution ; without accurate simulations , showers whose energy is overestimated can easily skew the measured spectrum .",
    "fluctuations can affect both ground based arrays as well as air fluorescence detectors that optically measure the shower development . for ground based arrays",
    ", suppression can change the relative position of shower maximum and the detector array .",
    "although a sea level detector is near shower maximum for @xmath96 ev vertically incident proton showers , for non - vertical showers , where the detector is deeper , it may be significantly behind shower maximum . the angular spreading discussed in subsection [ angle ]",
    "must also be considered .",
    "air fluorescence detectors will observe far fewer particles in the early stages of the shower than current simulations indicate .",
    "lpm , dielectric and pair creation suppression must all be considered .",
    "although lpm suppression affects the widest range of energies , the other mechanisms produce a larger reduction in cross section where they operate . for @xmath129 ,",
    "for example , dielectric suppression will reduce the number of bremsstrahlung photons with @xmath130 mev by two orders of magnitude .",
    "pair creation suppression is more energy dependent , but , for example , at 200 g/@xmath111 depth , emission of @xmath131 ev photons from @xmath132 ev electrons will be reduced by a factor of 10 .",
    "monte carlo simulations are required to find the actual shower profile , but the initial stages of the shower will be much less visible than current simulations indicate ; neither the profiles produced by capdevielle and atallah nor by kalmykov will be accurate .    even relatively late in the shower",
    ", there will be a reduction in the number of low energy particles .",
    "for example , where the average particle energy is @xmath133 ev , lpm suppression will reduce the number of photons below @xmath134500 mev .",
    "so , there can be measurable effects even relatively close to shower maximum .",
    "if a particle counting detector is too far above shower maximum , then it may underestimate the size of the shower .",
    "another way to visualize how suppression works is to consider the probability of photons penetrating deep into the atmosphere . because , for a given photon energy , suppression increases with depth , high energy photons have a non - negligible probability of penetrating deep into the atmosphere .",
    "this can drastically change the development of photons showers . for proton showers",
    ", it can create small , dense subshowers within the main shower .",
    "[ probconvert ] shows the interaction probability as a function of depth for a @xmath135 ev vertically incident photon .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show the lpm and bethe - heitler cases respectively . with bethe - heitler interaction probabilities ,",
    "essentially all of the photons have interacted by 3@xmath17 in depth , while with lpm interaction probabilities , the photon has a 7% chance of surviving to 10@xmath17 .    for protons , the effect is smaller , the other curves in fig .",

    "the effect on the average shower is small , but , because of the steeply falling spectrum , it is necessary to consider even relatively atypical showers .",
    "not considered here is magnetic suppression , which can dominate over other mechanisms for interactions in the upper 3 g/@xmath111 of the atmosphere .",
    "multiple scattering , the dielectric of the medium , bremsstrahlung and pair production themselves and external magnetic fields can suppress bremsstrahlung and pair production , with bremsstrahlung of low energy photons the most subject to suppression . suppression also broadens the angular spread of emitted bremsstrahlung photons and produced pairs .    for energetic enough particles ,",
    "these mechanisms reduce electron @xmath56 and photon pair production cross sections .",
    "when this happens , electromagnetic showers are lengthened , and shower to shower fluctuations become much larger .",
    "when suppression gets very large , then the shower angular development can be dominated by interactions , rather than multiple scattering .",
    "the importance of suppression in air showers depends on the incident particle type and energy . if the incoming particles are photons , then at @xmath109 ev , the effects are large . for @xmath109 protons ,",
    "the effects on the average shower is smaller , but the effects of fluctuations may be considerable , particularly when particular detector are included .",
    "as experiments probe to higher energies , of course , the effects will grow larger .",
