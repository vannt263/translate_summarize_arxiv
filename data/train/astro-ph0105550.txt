    "cosmic infrared background ( cib ) radiation is expected to arise from the cumulative emissions of pregalactic , protogalactic , and evolved galactic systems .",
    "it has long been recognized that measurement of the cib will provide new insight into energetic processes associated with structure formation and chemical evolution following the decoupling of matter from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( partridge & peebles 1967 ; harwit 1970 ; bond , carr , & hogan 1986 , 1991 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ; fall , charlot , & pei 1996 ) . in this paper ,",
    "the cib is defined to be extragalactic radiation , exclusive of the cmb , in the wavelength range 11000  @xmath0 m .",
    "sources of cosmic radiant energy include nuclear processes such as nucleosynthesis in stars ; gravitational processes , such as accretion of matter onto black holes ; and decaying unstable particles remaining from the big bang .",
    "though the primary radiant energy from such processes may not emerge at infrared wavelengths , the combined effects of the cosmic redshift and absorption of some fraction of the primary radiations by dust with re - emission by the dust at long wavelengths will shift much of the energy into the infrared .",
    "hence , the infrared background is expected to be uniquely informative about cosmic history .",
    "sky brightness measurements with instruments on nasa s cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) mission have provided the first definitive detections of the cib . in this paper",
    "i focus on the cobe measurements , which initially provided detections only at far infrared and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "i will also describe recent results of analyses based upon cobe data that have provided likely detections in the near infrared and restrictive limits in the mid - infrared , since these results are not covered substantially elsewhere at this conference .",
    "i then briefly describe some of the implications of these results .",
    "a comprehensive review paper on the infrared background and its implications is in preparation ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) .",
    "since energy distributions are of primary interest , sky brightness measurements are reported as @xmath1i@xmath2 in units of , where i@xmath2 is the spectral intensity at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "conversion to i@xmath2 can be accomplished using the relation @xmath1i@xmath2 ( ) = [ 3000/@xmath3m)]i@xmath2(mjy / sr ) .",
    "measurement of the cib has proven to be extraordinarily difficult .",
    "the only observational signature of the cib is an isotropic background arising external to the galaxy .",
    "there is no distinctive , predictable spectral signature of the cib , since many sources of luminosity can contribute , and their distribution in space and time , as well as the character and distribution of cosmic dust , will determine the observed spectral energy distribution . direct observation of the cib is impeded by the many foreground contributors to the infrared sky brightness at all wavelengths , several of them quite bright .",
    "a further challenge is the need for absolute photometry , that is , measurements relative to a well - established zero brightness level .",
    "instrument self - emission , stray light , and electronic offset signals must be eliminated or accurately determined .",
    "the cobe mission was designed to accomplish the best possible search for the cib from our location in the cosmos .",
    "it was recognized that such measurements required cryogenic instruments operated above the atmosphere for a substantial period of time so that potential sources of systematic errors in the absolute brightness measurements could be identified and evaluated .",
    "the approach was to obtain maps of high photometric quality over the whole sky and over a broad wavelength range so that foreground sources could be identified by their spatial and spectral signatures , and that uncertainties associated with discriminating them from the cib could be minimized .",
    "the cobe spacecraft carried two instruments contributing to these results ( boggess et al .",
    "the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) was designed primarily to search for the cib from 1.25 to 240  @xmath0 m .",
    "the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) was designed primarily to make a definitive measurement of the spectrum of the cmb , and to extend the search for the cib to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "all aspects of the cobe mission , from the instruments to the spacecraft , orbit , sky scan strategy , and data processing , were designed to optimize the ability to make these difficult diffuse background measurements .",
    "the dirbe instrument was an absolute photometer with 10 broad photometric bands at 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , 4.9 , 12 , 25 , 60 , 100 , 140 , and 240  @xmath0 m .",
    "it was designed to enable detection of cib levels as faint as @xmath4 .",
    "the dirbe instrument is described by silverberg et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and a summary of the dirbe investigation and its initial results is provided by hauser et al .",
    "additional detailed information is given in the cobe dirbe explanatory supplement ( 1997 ) .",
    "the dirbe was designed for extremely strong stray light rejection , employing an off - axis gregorian telescope , with a pupil stop , multiple field stops , and extensive internal and external baffling .",
    "the stray light was demonstrated to be less than 1 at all wavelengths .",
    "the instrument contained an internal cold chopper operating at 32 hz , which allowed continual measurement of the sky brightness relative to that of a stable , cold internal beam stop .",
    "it had a full beam cold shutter , closed typically five times per orbit to establish the zero point of the photometric scale by allowing measurement of the instrumental radiative and electronic zero point offsets .",
    "these offsets were stable , and the uncertainty in the determination of the offsets was 1 or less from 1.25 to 100  @xmath0 m , and was 5 ( 2 )  at 140 ( 240 )  @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the dirbe instantaneous field of view was 0.7@xmath5 x 0.7@xmath5 , a compromise between ability to discriminate stars and ability to map the whole sky with high redundancy every six months .",
    "redundancy was important because it allowed monitoring of the annual variations in apparent sky brightness in all directions due to the earth s motion within the interplanetary dust ( ipd ) cloud .",
    "this variation is a unique signature of the ipd contribution to the signal .",
    "the sensitivity ( 1@xmath6 ) of the instrument from 1.25 to 100  @xmath0 m was better than 1 per field of view averaged over the ten months of cryogenic operation , and was 33 ( 11 ) at 140 ( 240 )  @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the instrument gain stability was excellent , and was monitored on short time scales using internal stimulators .",
    "repeated observations of stable celestial sources provided photometric closure over the sky , and assured reproducible photometry to @xmath7 1% or better for the duration of the mission .",
    "calibration of the dirbe flux scale was accomplished from scans of a few isolated infrared sources of known brightness .",
    "the firas instrument was a fourier transform spectrometer in the form of a polarizing michelson interferometer , providing extremely precise spectral comparison of the sky brightness with that of a very accurate full beam blackbody calibrator at wavelengths from 100  @xmath0 m to 1 cm .",
    "the instrument and calibration are discussed by mather et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , fixsen et al .  (",
    "1994 ) , mather et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the cobe firas explanatory supplement ( 1997 ) .",
    "the firas light collector was a winston cone with a flared horn , providing a 7@xmath5 diameter field of view and low sidelobe response over the broad firas spectral range .",
    "the sensitivity ( 1@xmath6 ) of the instrument from 500  @xmath0 m to 3 mm was 0.8 per field of view averaged over the ten months of cryogenic operation .",
    "the photometric calibration errors ( 1@xmath6 ) associated with the precision blackbody calibrator were typically 0.02 mjy / sr , corresponding to @xmath8 at 200 ( 600 )  @xmath0 m wavelength respectively . over the course of the cobe mission ,",
    "the firas obtained superbly calibrated absolute spectral maps of almost the whole sky . using firas data , fixsen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and mather et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the rms deviation of the cmb spectrum from that of a @xmath9 k blackbody at wavelengths longer than 476  @xmath0 m was less than 50 parts per million of the peak cmb brightness .",
    "accurate knowledge of the cmb is necessary to search for the cib at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "fixsen et al .  (",
    "1997 ) demonstrated that the zero point and gain calibrations of the dirbe and firas photometric scales are consistent within the quoted uncertainties of each and the systematic uncertainties of the comparison .",
    "since the firas systematic calibration uncertainties are smaller than those of the dirbe , these results can be used to make small systematic corrections to the dirbe 140 and 240  @xmath0 m measurements .",
    "hauser et al .  ( 1998 ) discussed the effect of using the firas calibration on the dirbe 140 and 240  @xmath0 m cib detections , but dirbe - based results in the literature , including this paper , otherwise use the dirbe calibration .",
    "hence , the dirbe and firas instruments provided extensive , consistent , high quality photometric data on which to base a search for the cib .",
    "the cobe data have provided detections of the cib at some wavelengths and limits elsewhere within the spectral range of the two instruments .",
    "since foreground sources and the cmb dominate the observed sky brightness in all directions throughout the spectral range , all of these results require discrimination and removal of non - cib contributions .",
    "assessment of the reality of a potential cib measurement therefore requires careful analysis of the random and systematic uncertainties in the residuals from the measured sky brightness .",
    "the residual must also be demonstrated to be isotropic , and not likely to arise from any unmodeled foreground .",
    "quantitative results from all of the investigations described here are listed in table  1 .",
    "error bars for reported detections are 1@xmath6 . upper and lower limits are shown at the 95% cl , with actual values and 1@xmath6 uncertainties shown in parentheses .",
    "the third column indicates whether some degree of isotropy was demonstrated .",
    "the fourth column indicates whether the investigators claimed a detection ( yes ) , a possible detection ( tentative ) , or a limit ( no ) .",
    "the designation `` no '' is also used for any case where the result is less than 3 times the quoted uncertainty . for illustrative purposes ,",

    "the dirbe team searched for the cib in the data from all 10 dirbe wavelength bands , and results based upon the final photometric reduction of the dirbe data were reported by hauser et al .",
    "since there is no direction in the sky devoid of foreground radiation from the solar system and galaxy , the faintest measured sky brightness at each wavelength is a conservative upper limit on the cib . these dark sky limits ( 95% cl )",

    "the dirbe team further argued that these residuals could not plausibly arise from unmodeled components of the solar system or galaxy ( dwek et al .",
    "1998 ) , and concluded that the cib had been measured at those wavelengths .",
    "at all other dirbe wavelengths they reported cib upper limits ( 95% cl ) based upon the residuals and estimated uncertainties .",
    "they also determined a lower limit at 100  @xmath0 m based on the argument that a thermal source producing the spectrum detected at 140 and 240  @xmath0 m could not be fainter than this level at 100  @xmath0 m ( dwek et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the uncertainties reported by the dirbe team were dominated by systematic uncertainties in the foreground determination .",
    "this met the mission objective of searching for the cib to the limits imposed by our astrophysical environment .",
    "major sources of uncertainty were the stellar foreground model ( 1.23.5  @xmath0 m ) , the interplanetary dust model ( 1.25100  @xmath0 m ) , and the interstellar medium model ( 100240  @xmath0 m ) . because dirbe data can yield improved measurements of the cib as the foregrounds are better determined , it is worth summarizing how the dirbe team analysis was done .",
    "the interplanetary dust contribution presents the most difficult problem except at the longest wavelengths , since it dominates the measured sky brightness from 1140  @xmath0 m even at high galactic and ecliptic latitude ( see figure 2 , hauser et al .",
    "the contribution from the ipd was determined by fitting a parameterized model of the spatial distribution and scattering and radiative properties of the dust cloud to the apparent annual variation of the sky brightness over the whole sky ( kelsall et al .",
    "1998 ) . though this model was quite successful , reproducing the seasonal variation well and leaving evident map artifacts only at the few percent level ,",
    "the uncertainties in the small residual differences between the measured brightness and the model are still quite substantial .",
    "furthermore , it is not possible to determine a unique ipd model from sky brightness measurements from within the cloud .",
    "kelsall et al .  considered a number of different shapes for the cloud density distribution which gave comparably good fits to the time dependence , and estimated the model uncertainty by the spread in residual values at high galactic latitude between these models .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) described the dirbe team methods for determining the contribution of galactic sources .",
    "discrete bright sources within the galaxy and the magellanic clouds were blanked out of the dirbe maps . the contribution from discrete galactic sources fainter than the dirbe direct detection limit ( about 5th magnitude at 2.2  @xmath0 m )",
    "was calculated from 1.25 to 25  @xmath0 m using a faint source model based on the sky model of wainscoat et al .",
    "the sky model fits star count data over many wavelengths very well .",
    "the contribution from the interstellar medium ( ism ) was identified by its angular variation over the sky .",
    "the 100  @xmath0 m map , after removal of the ipd contribution and an estimated value of the 100  @xmath0 m cib , was used as a template for ism emission .",
    "the estimate of the 100  @xmath0 m cib was obtained by correlating 100  @xmath0 m emission with h  i column density at well - studied dark fields near the north ecliptic pole and the lockman hole and extrapolating the correlation to zero h  i column density .",
    "this correlation is linear at low column densities .",
    "if all of the galactic infrared emission were correlated with h  i gas , extrapolation of this correlation to zero column density would yield the extragalactic light .",
    "if there is additional infrared emission associated with other gas components not correlated with h  i , this procedure would not yield accurate results .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) chose these two fields because the molecular gas has also been mapped , and low limits on the contribution from ionized gas could be set using pulsar dispersion measures and h@xmath24 measurements .",
    "the residual maps at all wavelengths other than 100  @xmath0 m , after removal of the ipd contribution and blanking of bright sources , were correlated with the ism template to determine a global color for each .",
    "the template was then scaled by that color and subtracted from each map .",
    "these final residual maps were tested for positive residuals and isotropy at high galactic latitude where foregrounds are least bright .",
    "note that an error in the estimated 100  @xmath0 m cib would not have affected the isotropy tests of the residual maps , only the brightness of the residual . the uncertainty in the estimated 100  @xmath0 m cib was included in estimating the cib uncertainties at all other wavelengths .",
    "the residual maps at 140 and 240  @xmath0 m showed significant , isotropic residuals in dark regions of the sky , but the most precise determination of the brightness of the residual at these wavelengths was obtained by correlating the emission at these wavelengths with h  i column density in the dark fields in the lockman hole and north ecliptic pole regions , as described above . to remove the ism from the 100  @xmath0 m map for purposes of looking for an isotropic residual at 100  @xmath0 m , the h  i map of stark et al .",

    ", they removed the zodiacal emission contribution using the dirbe 25  @xmath0 m map as a template . correlating the residual maps with h  i maps they found a significant constant additional term at 140 and 240  @xmath0 m which they identified as a possible measurement of the cib",

    "they extrapolated this model to longer wavelengths assuming @xmath25 .",
    "since the ipd contribution to the sky brightness at these wavelengths is small , an accurate ipd model is not required .",
    "they assumed that the interstellar emission at high galactic latitude and low h  i column density is traced by h  i , and that the submillimeter emission correlated with h  i can be represented by a single temperature medium with a @xmath26 emissivity law .",
    "they also made a correction for infrared emission associated with ionized gas not correlated with the h  i , which significantly reduced their residual at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "their residual maps showed no significant gradients with galactic latitude or longitude , so the residual background was at least approximately isotropic .",
    "figure  1 shows the residual spectra of puget et al .  with and without the ionized gas correction , with a break around 500  @xmath0 m due to the shift between the firas high and low frequency channels .",

    "1998 ) out to they used three different methods to look for an isotropic residual distinct from emission from the ism .",
    "one method assumed that the ism spectrum is the same in all directions , but the intensity is spatially varying .",
    "the second method assumed that the neutral and ionized phases of the ism are traced by a combination of maps of h  i 21-cm line emission and of c  ii ( 158  @xmath0 m ) line emission .",
    "the latter was mapped over the sky by firas ( bennett et al .",
    "each component , including a term proportional to the square of the h  i intensity , was allowed to have a distinct spectrum . in the third method",
    ", they assumed that the ism emission is traced by a linear combination of the dirbe ism maps at 140 and 240  @xmath0 m ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) , each term again having its own spectrum .",
    "though each of these methods is subject to quite different systematic errors , the three methods yielded a consistent residual isotropic background , providing confidence that this is a robust determination of the submillimeter spectrum of the cib .",

    "they attributed this emission to the warm ionized medium in the galaxy . subtracting the emission associated with these two gas - phase components from the mean firas spectrum in low h  i column density regions",

    "( 1998 ) value , and the 140  @xmath0 m value , which differs by less than 2@xmath6 , is positive by @xmath28 and therefore most confidently provides an upper limit .",
    "recently , lagache et al .  ( 2000 ) extended the study of infrared emission from the warm ionized medium using data from the wisconsin h@xmath24 mapper ( wham ) sky survey of reynolds et al .",
    "they analyzed diffuse emission regions covering about 2% of the sky at high galactic latitude . assuming a constant electron density so they could relate emission measure to h@xmath29 column density",
    ", they found a marginally better correlation of infrared emission at firas resolution with a linear combination of h  i and h@xmath29 column density than with h  i alone .",
    "their results suggest that 2030% of the far - infrared emission at high galactic latitudes is uncorrelated with h  i gas .",

    "( 1998 ) , but did not demonstrate that this residual was isotropic .",
    "recognizing that the uncertainties in isolating the bright contribution from the ipd are a major obstacle to cib detection in the far infrared , finkbeiner , davis , & schlegel ( 2000 ) analyzed the dirbe data using two approaches which avoid the need for a detailed ipd model .",
    "both methods were based on analysis of the annual variation of dimensionless ratios of the data after removal of the ism contribution .",
    "the approach of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was used to determine the ism contribution .",
    "subtraction of the ism contribution from each dirbe weekly map yielded maps nominally containing only the ipd signal , which varies over the course of the year , and any time - independent signals due to other galactic contributions and the cib .",

    ", they analyzed a second dimensionless ratio based upon brightnesses at 90@xmath5 solar elongation and symmetric ecliptic latitudes forward and backwards relative to the earth s direction of motion .",
    "interpretation of the results of this method does depend modestly on assumptions about the ecliptic latitude dependence of the ipd contribution , i.e. , on a model for the ipd cloud at high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "these two methods gave comparable results for the constant backgrounds at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m .",
    "finkbeiner et al .  tentatively identified these backgrounds with the cib ( table  1 ) , but noted that the values are rather high and not consistent with limits implied by the opacity of the intergalactic medium to tev @xmath30-rays ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ; samuelson et al .",
    "they concluded that there is not yet a satisfactory explanation for these constant backgrounds .",
    "a distinctly different approach to studying the cib is to look for fluctuations attributable to the non - uniform spatial distribution of discrete sources contributing to the background .",
    "if one can estimate the expected amplitude of the fluctuations relative to the brightness of the background itself , one can use observations of the fluctuations to determine or set limits upon the cib .",
    "of course , measuring fluctuations in the extragalactic background brightness presents similar challenges of discriminating contributions from foreground sources and instrumental effects as those that exist for direct detection of the background .",
    "however , at mid - infrared wavelengths , the dominant ipd foreground is less of an obstacle to fluctuation studies than to total cib brightness measurements since the ipd emission varies relatively smoothly over the sky .",
    "kashlinsky et al .  ( 1996a ) provided a framework for such analyses . in order to relate fluctuations to the intensity of the cib",
    ", they evaluated the expected fluctuations from galaxies , finding that the fluctuations on the 0.7@xmath5 angular scale of the dirbe beam are expected to be of the order of 510% of the cib .",

    "these analyses imply upper limits to the 12100  @xmath0 m cib contributed by sources clustered like galaxies of the order of 1015 , the most restrictive limits based upon infrared measurements in this spectral range ( table  1 ) .",
    "following the work of hauser et al .",

    "( 1998 ) was a major source of uncertainty at these wavelengths , several approaches have been used to reduce that uncertainty .",

    "1998 ) from the dirbe maps yielded a map of starlight at 2.2  @xmath0 m ( the ism contribution at this wavelength is negligible ) . using this 2.2  @xmath0 m starlight map as a spatial template for starlight at 3.5  @xmath0 m",
    ", they obtained a significantly positive 3.5  @xmath0 m residual , @xmath34 \\pm 2.9 $ ] , where @xmath35 is the actual cib at 2.2  @xmath0 m .",

    "they also obtained somewhat improved upper limits on the cib at 1.25 and 4.9  @xmath0 m using the same stellar template ( table  1 ) .",
    "gorjian , wright , & chary ( 2000 ) reduced the stellar foreground uncertainty more directly by measuring all of the stars brighter than 9th magnitude at 2.2 and 3.5  @xmath0 m in a dark 2@xmath5 x 2@xmath5 field near the north galactic pole .",
    "they calculated the contribution of fainter stars using the statistical model of wainscoat et al .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculated light from objects below this faint limit is negligibly small , even at high galactic latitude .",
    "they also used a model for the zodiacal light contribution which differed from that of kelsall et al .",
    "they argued that the kelsall et al .",
    "model left a high galactic latitude residual at 25  @xmath0 m which is dominated by ipd emission .",
    "the ipd model used by gorjian et al .  was similar to that of kelsall et al .  in",
    "that it required that the apparent annual time variation be reproduced , but it further required that the residual brightness at 25  @xmath0 m after zodiacal light removal be constant at a value of zero at high galactic latitude ( the  very strong no zodi principle \" of wright 1997 ) . after removing the ipd and stellar contributions , gorjian et al .  found significant positive residuals at 2.2 and 3.5  @xmath0 m which they identified as probable detections of the cib ( table  1 ) .",

    "wright & reese ( 2000 ) compared the histograms of the pixel intensity distributions in the dirbe 2.2 and 3.5  @xmath0 m maps in five fields at high galactic and high ecliptic latitudes with the histograms predicted from the star count model of wainscoat et al .",
    "the ipd contribution had first been removed from the observations using the model of gorjian et al .",

    "they noted that the histogram method is statistically more powerful for finding a real residual and less subject to systematic errors in the star count model than the subtraction approach used by arendt et al .",

    "wright ( 2000 ) considerably strengthened the case for detection of the cib at 2.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "he used the newly released 2mass catalog to remove the contribution of galactic stars brighter than 14th magnitude from the dirbe maps at 1.25 and 2.2  @xmath0 m in 4 dark regions in the north and south galactic polar caps .",

    "wright & reese ( 2000 ) .",
    "hence , there is a strong case for detection of an isotropic cib at 2.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "the average value of the 2.2  @xmath0 m cib determinations by these three methods is @xmath36 .",
    "the scatter in the 1.25  @xmath0 m residuals was too large to claim a detection .",
    "wright s analysis does provide the strongest current upper limit on the cib at that wavelength .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in all of these analyses of the near infrared cib remains the uncertainty in the zodiacal light contribution .",
    "kashlinsky & odenwald ( 2000 ) found that the amplitude of the fluctuations in the dirbe 1.254.9  @xmath0 m maps varied with @xmath27 . extrapolating to @xmath27=0 , they found positive intercepts which they attributed to fluctuations in the cib .",
    "they reported rms fluctuations of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 at 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 4.9  @xmath0 m respectively , where the errors are 92% confidence limits . adopting their argument that the fluctuations are expected to be 510% of the cib , these results are generally consistent with the direct background determinations listed in table  1 .",

    "isotropy tests , if done at all , are generally over very limited sky areas",
    ". it would therefore seem premature to consider the differences between detections and lower limits as clear evidence for missing components of the background . in terms of energy distribution , the @xmath42 values in the shortest and longest wavelength regions are rather comparable .    in the range from 4.9 to 100  @xmath0 m",

    "other fairly restrictive upper limits in this spectral range come from analysis of attenuation of tev @xmath30-rays , as reviewed elsewhere at this conference ( stecker 2001 ) .",
    "taking the most restrictive limits at face value , the emerging picture is one of substantial background energy in the far infrared and submillimeter , with a comparable level in the near infrared . to make this picture somewhat quantitative",

    "significant reduction in that uncertainty may require measurements with instruments in deep space , either out of the ecliptic plane or at several au from the sun .",
