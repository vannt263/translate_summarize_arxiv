    "medium and high resolution spectroscopy has revealed the presence of metals in the high redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) through the detection of absorption systems in the spectra of background quasi stellar objects ( qsos ) ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the enrichment source of these absorption systems is still poorly constrained .",
    "there is a debate as to whether these intergalactic metals originated in the recent past from nearby galaxies driving large - scale outflows of their interstellar media , or whether the igm may have received a ` blanket ' enrichment at much earlier times , when the universe became reionised by the first stars and galaxies .",
    "@xcite favour the `` pre - galactic enrichment '' scenario , arguing that the cross - correlation function between lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and  absorbers at @xmath13 , as well as the mean absorption line density , can be explained by enriched supernova ( sn ) driven winds from dwarf galaxies at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these lbg progenitors could generate metal bubbles @xmath15kpc ( comoving ) in size within the same high - density regions of the igm where lbgs would later form .",
    "on the other hand , the connection between star forming galaxies and metal absorption features is now firmly established at redshifts @xmath16 , strongly supporting the idea that galactic outflows , or ` superwinds ' as they are often referred to , are one of the main sources of metal enrichment of the igm , at least at these redshifts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "evidence for such outflows is provided by the nearly universal blueshift of interstellar absorption lines observed against the nuclei of galaxies undergoing vigorous star formation episodes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the outflowing gas reaching velocities of up to @xmath17  relative to systemic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "in a recent study of galactic outflows at @xmath18 , @xcite found that wind velocities increase with mass and star formation rate ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a similar trend ( @xmath20 ) had previosuly been shown to hold in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) at redshift @xmath21 by @xcite ; both @xcite and @xcite found that 7085% of ulirgs at low redshifts ( @xmath22 ) drive such energetic outflows .",
    "the common occurrence of outflows in galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation and the obvious importance of this phenomenon for galaxy evolution and the enrichment of the igm are some of the reasons why superwinds are attracting a great deal of theoretical interest .",
    "one of the goals of current theoretical work is to provide a physical explanation for the somewhat puzzling redshift evolution of the comoving density of  ions in the igm , @xmath23 .",
    "looking back in time , @xmath23 appears to be approximately constant during a @xmath24gyr interval between @xmath25 and 5 , and then drops by a factor of @xmath26 over a period of only @xmath27myr from @xmath28 to 5.8 @xcite .    in a series of papers @xcite , oppenheimer and",
    "collaborators have explored different wind scenarios using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations which explicitly incorporate outflows from starburst galaxies and concluded that momentum - driven winds give the best agreement with the observations .",
    "interestingly , in their simulations the outflows travel to similar distances @xmath29physical kpc at all redshifts they considered .",
    "if this is the case in reality , it would imply that at early epochs the metal enrichment by star - forming galaxies affects larger volumes of the universe than at later times .",
    "@xcite have also highlighted the importance of feedback from galactic winds for understanding the properties of metal absorption systems in the igm . among the models they considered , those without galactic feedback could not reproduce the observed evolution of the @xmath23 , while momentum - driven wind simulations gave the best match with observations , in agreement with the proposal by @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite concluded that the dominant mechanism responsible for the metal enrichment of the igm is star formation feedback from the analysis of hydrodynamical simulations tuned to reproduce the star formation history of the universe from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . in these simulations ,  and",
    "are mostly located in regions with temperature @xmath32k that have been swept - up by the shocks produced by galactic - scale winds ; absorption systems with column densities @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35are associated with galaxies of luminosities @xmath36 .    while it is generally agreed that galactic outflows are the most likely mechanism for enriching the igm ,",
    "the observational evidence for such outflows has so far been limited mostly to galaxies at @xmath37 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "even @xmath38 galaxies are too faint to record individual spectral features ",
    "other than the  emission line  with sufficient precision to measure kinematic offsets between the stars and the outflowing gas in individual galaxies .",
    "@xcite did find such offsets in _ stacked _ spectra of @xmath39 and 6 galaxies selected from the great observatories origins deep survey and indeed concluded that : `` powerful , large - scale winds are common at high redshift '' .",
    "nevertheless , it is of great interest to explore the outflow phenomenon in more detail at the highest redshifts , as it holds the key not only to the initial stages of the chemical evolution of the universe , but also presumably to the escape of lyman continuum photons responsible for reionizing the igm at @xmath40 .",
    "if the general picture assembled from the above cosmological simulations is correct , most  absorption systems at @xmath41 should be on their first outward trajectory and should be found close to the parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "then , a key observational test of these models is to identify the star - forming galaxies close to known  absorption systems in the spectra of the highest redshifts qsos .",
    "one of the strongest  absorbers in the high-@xmath42 surveys by @xcite and @xcite is at @xmath43 towards the @xmath4 qso sdss j1030 + 0524 , with rest frame equivalent widths @xmath44  and @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the field of this qso was imaged in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 bands with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ by @xcite .",
    "these authors reported a statistical excess of galaxies photometrically classified as @xmath10-dropouts ( i.e. with @xmath48 ) , and hence potentially located at @xmath49 .",
    "this result was later confirmed by @xcite as part of a larger study of @xmath10-dropouts around five qsos at @xmath50 . in the latter work ,",
    "@xmath51 @xmath10-dropouts were found in the field of the qso sdss j1030 + 0524 ( @xmath52arcmin@xmath53 ) compared to @xmath54 expected from a random distribution of galaxies at these redshifts @xcite . in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts for all but one of the @xmath10-dropouts  a  emitter at @xmath55 , both @xcite and @xcite speculated that the excess galaxies may be part of the same overdensity that includes the qso .",
    "however , it may also be the case that some of the candidate galaxies are in fact associated with the foreground  absorber , particularly as two of the @xmath10-dropouts lie within @xmath56arcsec of the qso .",
    "this separation corresponds to a transverse distance of @xmath57kpc ( physical ) from the qso line - of - sight at @xmath58 ; at @xmath593 this is the impact parameter within which strong  absorption is found to be associated with actively star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , this field is an ideal location for testing whether galactic outflows are indeed responsible for producing  absorbers at @xmath60 , and how the properties of such outflows compare with those at lower redshifts .    motivated by these considerations",
    ", we have performed deep spectroscopic observations of the two galaxies closest to the sight - line to the qso sdss j1030 + 0524 , and of the additional galaxy already known to be a  emitter from the discovery paper by @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our spectroscopic observations as well as our reassessment of the photometry of the acs images obtained by @xcite .",
    "we present our results in section 3 and discuss their implications in section 4 .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section 5 . throughout this work we use ab magnitudes and assume a flat universe with @xmath61  mpc@xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we obtained medium resolution spectra of three galaxies in the field of the qso sdss j1030 + 0524 photometrically identified by @xcite to be at at @xmath65 .",
    "two of the galaxies were selected as being closest to the qso sightline , at transverse distances of @xmath57kpc ( assuming that they are at @xmath666 ) . the third galaxy , j103024.08 + 052420.4 , is the only object in the field for which @xcite were able to measure a spectroscopic redshift , @xmath67 ; we re - observed this source for comparison purposes .",
    "the spectra were obtained with fors2 on ut1 of the eso vlt , operated in multi - object spectroscopic mode using @xmath68 slits with the gris_600z grism which covers the wavelength range from 7370 to 11000 .",
    "the resolution is fwhm=4.9(or 172.5  at 8500 ) , sampled with three pixels .",
    "a total of 36 exposures of 900s each were acquired between 2007 april 24 and 2007 june 17 ; two of these were of very low signal - to - noise ratio and were excluded from the final stack of combined spectra .",
    "the total integration time of the final image was @xmath69s .",
    "the observations were carried out in service mode and processed by eso using automatic pipelines .",
    "the data products consist of a sky - subtracted 2d image for each 900s exposure , wavelength calibrated and corrected for bias , overscan , dark current and flat field .",
    "given the challenging nature of these faint object observations , we also processed the images independently of the eso pipeline ( starting from the sky subtraction stage ) , using conventional iraf tasks .",
    "specifically , we combined the two - dimensional slit image of each object with imcombine and we found a single emission line centered along the spatial axis ( slit direction ) at the position where each object is expected to be .",
    "then , we extracted individual exposures with apall and combined them in observational blocks of three exposures with scombine prior to the flux calibration . once each block was flux calibrated ( using the provided spectroscopic standard star spectra and iraf tasks standard , sensfunc and calibrate ) , we averaged all the blocks and confirmed the presence of an emission line uncontaminated by sky residuals in the final combined spectrum of each object .",
    "having performed this independent check , and taking into consideration that the eso pipeline was developed specifically to reduce any systematic effect from the telescope and the instrument , we resumed the reduction process of eso pipeline output files using iraf .",
    "given that the galaxies are very faint , the sky subtraction residuals in each slit were removed with the task background , using a first order polynomial , before the extraction of individual spectra .",
    "automatic cosmic ray cleaning was carried out at this stage , with a few cosmic - ray affected pixels requiring manual cleaning . finally , after flux calibrating each spectrum , we combined the spectra of each galaxy in a weighted average , where the weight is the median flux value of the 810 pixels centred on the  emission line , which is the only spectral feature detected .",
    "the results of our spectroscopic analysis are presented in section 3 .",
    "the existence of an overdensity of galaxies at @xmath60 in the field of the @xmath70 qso sdss j1030 + 0524 first reported by @xcite has more recently been confirmed by @xcite .",
    "this was not unexpected , given that both studies used the same acs/_hst _ images , the same colour section criterion and the same s / n limit .",
    "it is therefore somewhat surprising that two out of the three galaxies we targeted , originally communicated to us by m. stiavelli , [ in @xcite no information was provided on individual galaxy positions , magnitudes and colours ] , are not included in the later compilation by @xcite .",
    "having confirmed spectroscopically that both objects are indeed at @xmath60 ( at @xmath71 and @xmath1 respectively ; see section 3 ) , we decided to remeasure ourselves the magnitudes @xmath47 and colours @xmath72 of all three galaxies considered here .    the data retrieved from the public _ hst _",
    "archive consist of seven images in the @xmath46 band with a total exposure time of 5840s , and nine images in the @xmath47 band with a total exposure time of 11300s .",
    "we ran multidrizzle on the reduced images ( _ flt _ files ) with a linear size of output pixels in arcseconds per pixel of _ pixscale _ = 0.6 .",
    "the size of a pixel in units of the input pixel size was _ pixfrac _ = 1.0 and inverse - variance maps were used as weighting image ( _ final_wht_type _ = _ ivm _ ) .",
    "distortion corrections were computed with the most updated distortion coefficient tables available from the multimission archive at the space telescope ( mast ) .",
    "we used sextractor version 2.5.0 to calculate the magnitudes and colours of the three galaxies in our sample in order to have a consistent comparison with previous works in the same field .",
    "photometry was performed in pseudo - dual image mode in the @xmath47 band and dual image mode in the @xmath46 band with the @xmath47 as detection image .",
    "the weight map from multidrizzle was used in the detection image and the corresponding exposure time map was used in the measurement images .",
    "we adopted mag_auto as the total magnitude of each source .",
    "zeropoint magnitudes were obtained from the space telescope science institute website updated on may 19th , 2009 . the values corresponding to f775w and f850lp filters for the date of observation are 25.67849 and 26.86663 respectively . regarding extinction correction ,",
    "the same values determined by @xcite were used : 0.048 and 0.036 for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 magnitudes respectively .",
    "colours give in table  [ mag ] were computed using isophotal photometry ( mag_iso ) .",
    "owing to correlated noise introduced by multidrizzle in the final image , the errors in magnitude and flux determination provided by sextractor are incorrect . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the first step is to calculate the following correction factor , @xmath73 , valid in the case _ pixscale _ ( @xmath74 )",
    "@xmath75 _ pixfrac _ ( @xmath76 ) @xmath77 then , we applied the following correction to the error in the flux estimation and the error in the magnitude @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the flux error estimated by sextractor , @xmath81 is the measured flux and @xmath82 is the gain .    in table [ mag ] we list the magnitudes and colours of the three galaxies corrected for correlated noise and galactic extinction . for the one galaxy in common with @xcite , j103024.08 + 052420.41 ,",

    "as shown in figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 , we detect a single emission line in each of the three galaxies observed .",
    "we interpret these features as  emission lines at redshifts @xmath876.0 , for the following reasons .    as discussed in more detail below ( section  [ color.com ] ) , the ( @xmath72 ) colours of the galaxies together with their faint @xmath47 magnitudes are indicative of high redhifts , @xmath88 .",
    "the main contaminants in this colour regime are galaxies at @xmath892 ; in this case , the emission lines we have detected could conceivably be [ oii]@xmath90 . at @xmath911.3",
    ". however , the [ oii ] doublet , with a wavelength separation of @xmath92should be resolved in our spectra , which have a resolution of 4.9  fwhm .",
    "furthermore , even if the individual doublet lines were not fully resolved , we expect the width of the features to be fwhm@xmath93 , broader than fwhm@xmath94 and 6.0we measure for the two newly discovered emission lines reported here , in targets  2 and 3 respectively .",
    "the emission line in target  1 was independently identified as  by @xcite on the basis of its asymmetric profile which is characteristic of resonantly scattered emission in galaxies undergoing large - scale outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the most likely interpretation is that all three features are  emission lines at redshifts @xmath876.0 , as detailed below .",
    "we measured the values of @xmath95 for each galaxy from the peak of the emission line ; we estimate the uncertainty of the redshifts to be @xmath96 from consideration of the seeing and spectral resolution of our data .",
    "however , it should be borne in mind that the forest could absorb a significant fraction of the emission on the blue wing of the line , leading to an overestimate of the redshift .",
    "we also measured the line flux , from which we calculate @xmath97 , the ly@xmath98 luminosity in our cosmology .",
    "this in turn can be used to estimate the star formation rate , sfr@xmath99 , using kennicutt s ( 1998 ) calibration of sfr@xmath100 and case b recombination    @xmath101    the above conversion assumes a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ; adopting the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf which has proportionally fewer low mass stars would reduce the values of sfr@xmath99 by a factor of @xmath102 . on the other hand , it is well known that the uncorrected ly@xmath98  emission line luminosity can lead to significant _ _ under__estimates of the sfr  not only because of overlapping absorption by the ly@xmath98  forest , but especially as a consequence of resonant scattering .",

    "the first point to note is that , with a sfr@xmath176m@xmath114 yr@xmath62 , j103026.49 + 052505.14 is typical of the galaxies driving outflows at redshifts @xmath593 in the sample of @xcite .",
    "second , the rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath177 at @xmath43 in the spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524 is @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "this value is intermediate between the last two points in the @xmath175 vs. galactocentric impact parameter @xmath178 plot constructed by @xcite , between which the line equivalent width drops dramatically from @xmath179  at @xmath180kpc to @xmath181  at @xmath182kpc . if we simply interpolate between these two points , we find that @xmath44  is _ on average _ expected to be measured at impact parameters @xmath183kpc . for comparison ,",
    "the 13.5arcsec separation on the sky between the galaxy j103026.49 + 052505.14 and the qso sdss j1030 + 0524 corresponds to an impact parameter @xmath184kpc at @xmath43 .",
    "given the uncertainties in the interpolation and the likely spread of the average relationship between @xmath175 and @xmath178 when applied to any individual galaxy , we conclude that the strength of the  absorption seen 79kpc from the galaxy j103026.49 + 052505.14 is typical of the galaxy - scale outflows operating at redshifts @xmath185 .",
    "with only the  line at our disposal , we do not have any information on the speed of the outflow from j103026.49 + 052505.14 which has spread metals over radii of at least 79kpc .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of the ir photometry necessary to characterise the spectral energy distribution of this galaxy , we have no means to estimate the age of the starburst .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to consider some relevant timescales .",
    "the analysis by @xcite , together with the results of high resolution spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed star - forming galaxies at @xmath593 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , has shown that while galactic winds may be launched with speed of typically @xmath186 , the gas accelerates outwards reaching speeds of up to 800  before reaching the virial radius .",
    "if the bulk of the gas outflowing from j103026.49 + 052505.14 were indeed moving at @xmath187 , it would reach distances of @xmath156kpc  and could produce absorption in the qso spectrum  in only @xmath15myr .",
    "on the other hand , other authors have considered more modest outflow velocities , largely on theoretical grounds .",
    "@xcite argued that average outflow speeds of less than 200  are required to match the line - of - sight correlation function of  absorbers at redshifts @xmath1884.5 .",
    "@xcite favour such velocities because in their cosmological simulations they are found to be sufficiently high to enrich the low density igm and yet low enough to avoid overheating it .",
    "more recently , @xcite pointed out that the rapid rise in the intergalactic density of  from @xmath189 and 4.7 discovered by @xcite and @xcite may be inconsistent with the near - complete reionization of the igm by @xmath190 and the slower build - up of stellar mass during this epoch .",
    "all of these observations can be reconciled , however , if there is a delay of @xmath191700myr between the onset of star formation and the appearance of its products ( i.e. the metals ) at distances of @xmath15kpc from the sites of productions .",
    "the corresponding outflow speeds implied by this argument are also of order @xmath186 .",
    "adopting a more modest value @xmath135for the outflow from j103026.49 + 052505.14 would imply a travel time @xmath192myr to reach the qso sight - line .",
    "in turn , this would place the onset of star formation in this galaxy at @xmath193 where galaxies are now claimed to be found in increasing numbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in future , deep observations of this and other galaxies in the field of the qso sdss j1030 + 0524 at infrared wavelengths should allow a rough determination of the age of the galaxy from which an estmate of the speed of the outflows may be inferred .",
    "@xcite showed that , given the typical extent ( @xmath194kpc ) of metal - enriched regions around star - forming galaxies at @xmath195 , galaxies brighter than @xmath196 can account for approximately half of the number of  absorption systems with @xmath197seen in qso spectra at this average redshift .",
    "the corollary of this statement is that a galaxy with @xmath198 should be found within @xmath194kpc of half the qso absorbers , with the remainder presumably associated with fainter galaxies .    given that the properties of the outflow from j103026.49 + 052505.14 are at least superficially similar to those of star - forming galaxies at @xmath593 , as discussed above , we can repeat the same exercise at the higher redshifts considered here .",
    "specifically , we estimate the number of  absorption systems per unit of redshift ( @xmath199 ) expected from galaxies detected in the field of qso sdss j1030 + 0524 at @xmath200 , using the model proposed by @xcite . through a comparison with the observed value of @xmath201",
    ", we draw conclusions on the properties of galaxies contributing to the metal enrichment of the igm at @xmath7 and calculate the chances that the @xmath202  system may be produced by an undetected , fainter , galaxy instead of j103026.49 + 052505.14 .",
    "we consider the limiting magnitude in the acs images to estimate an upper limit to the uv luminosity of undetected galaxies . adopting the @xmath50 luminosity function by @xcite ( @xmath203 , @xmath204mpc@xmath205 , @xmath206 ) we find that the acs images of the field are sufficiently deep to reveal galaxies with luminosity @xmath207 .",
    "integrating the luminosity function , we find that the number density of galaxies with @xmath207 is @xmath208mpc@xmath205 .",
    "if the model by @xcite is still valid at @xmath209 , the co - moving cross section for absorption per galaxy is @xmath210mpc@xmath53 for an impact parameter @xmath211kpc ( physical ) . at the @xmath43 of the   absorber ,",
    "the comoving pathlength per unit of redshift is @xmath212mpc .",
    "thus , we want to know the predicted number of absorption systems per unit of redshift @xmath213 with @xmath197 . with the above values for @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216",
    ", we find @xmath217 .",
    "this estimate is @xmath218 of the observed value @xmath219 at redshift @xmath220 estimated by @xcite , from the results of @xcite , and @xcite for absorption systems with column densities in the range @xmath221@xmath22215.0@xmath35 .",
    "the shortfall is presumably higher when we include weaker  systems , since the @xcite limit @xmath223 corresponds to column densities @xmath221@xmath224@xmath35for unsaturated absorption lines , somewhat lower than the column density of  for which absorption line statistics are currently available at these high redshifts .",
    "we conclude that , if star - forming galaxies at @xmath200 have enriched surrounding regions to radii of @xmath57kpc , as is the case at @xmath593 , it is necessary to reach at least @xmath225 ( @xmath226 , i.e. one magnitude fainter than the acs images considered in this work ) in order to detect the full population of galaxies linked to absorption systems with @xmath221@xmath22215.0@xmath35 .",
    "from deep spectroscopy of galaxies in the field of @xmath4 qso sdss j1030 + 0524 we have identified three  emitters at @xmath227 . of these three galaxies , the brightest ( @xmath168 ) and closest to the qso sight - line ( impact parameter @xmath184kpc ) ,",
    "j103026.49 + 052505.14 , is at a redshift @xmath228 which differs by only @xmath229from the absorption redshift of a strong  system in the spectrum of the qso .",
    "the chances of a random association between  emitter and  absorber are very low .",
    "for example , if we first consider the idealised case of a random distribution of galaxies with @xmath230mpc@xmath205 , appropriate to galaxies of luminosity @xmath231 , then there is only a @xmath232 ( @xmath233% ) chance of finding such a galaxy within a sphere of radius 90kpc ( physical ) centred on the qso sight - line at @xmath166 .",
    "however , for this calculation it is more appropriate to consider a cylinder , rather than a sphere , with radius 90kpc but depth along the line of sight corresponding to @xmath234 , the velocity difference between the  emitter and the  absorber .",
    "the volume of this configuration is approximately six times larger than that of a sphere of radius 90kpc , raising the probability of finding a galaxy by chance within this volume to @xmath235% .",
    "a second factor to take into account is galaxy clustering .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite reported an overdensity by a factor of @xmath133 at @xmath60 in the field of the qso j1030 + 0524 .",
    "if this average factor applied to the environment of the galaxy j103026.49 + 052505.14 , the above probability would be increased by a factor of two .",
    "more important , however , is the possibility of significant clustering with lower luminosity dwarf galaxies which would remain unrecognised given the current limits of the photometry in this field .",
    "extending the above calculations further down the luminosity function , to galaxies as faint as @xmath236 , would increase the above probability by one order of magnitude .",
    "indeed , the @xmath237  velocity difference between  emission and  absorption could be taken as evidence for an origin of the metals in a dwarf galaxy in the same overdensity as j103026.49 + 052505.14 .",
    "on the other hand , at present we have no way of addressing empirically the question of whether such low - luminosity galaxies support large - scale outflows of metal - enriched gas , and how their mass - outflow rates compare with those of the more luminous galaxies in which the outflows are seen directly .",
    "the result reported here is the first direct observational evidence that the circum - galactic medium of early luminous star - forming galaxies was already enriched with heavy elements at @xmath7 .",
    "even at these high redshifts , some of the properties of the galaxy - wide outflows responsible for enriching the circum - galactic medium appear to be superficially similar to those of their counterparts at @xmath593 , which have been characterised in some detail .",
    "in particular , the strength of the  absorption associated with j103026.49 + 052505.14 at a radial distance of 79kpc fits in well with expectations based on data appropriate to lower redshifts galaxies , even though the average density of the igm was much higher at @xmath7 than at @xmath593 .",
    "we emphasise the importance of extending the available photometry of j103026.49 + 052505.14 to include near - ir bands from which the sed of the galaxy can be determined with the accuracy required to deduce its age . with this information in hand ,",
    "it should be possible to estimate the average speed of the outflow which has transported the metals out to at least @xmath156kpc from the stars that produced them . if a speed @xmath238is appropriate , as argued by some",
    ", the starburst episode must have lasted at least @xmath191myr , placing its origin at @xmath239 ; we now know this to have been an epoch when star - formation in galaxies was already underway .",
    "higher outflow speeds would imply later onsets of the starburst .",
    "the observations presented here show that it is feasible , with dedication , to identify the galaxies linked to qso absorption systems even at the highest redshifts where intervening metals have been detected in qso spectra , and thus provide an incentive to pursue similar searches in other fields .",
    "finally , we also point out that the colour cut @xmath11 which has been proposed to avoid low redshift interlopers can miss a significant proportion of bluer galaxies at @xmath12 thus affecting mainly the lae population .",
    "we are pursuing this topic in a forthcoming paper .",
