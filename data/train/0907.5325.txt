    "after the spread of the financial crisis in 2008 , the term systemic risk could be well regarded as the buzzword of these years .",
    "although there is no consensus on a formal definition of systemic risk , it usually denotes the risk that a whole system , consisting of many interacting agents , fails .",
    "these agents , in an economic context , could be firms , banks , funds , or other institutions . only very recently",
    ", financial economics is accepting the idea that the relation between robustness of individual institutions and systemic risk is not necessarily straightforward @xcite . the debate on systemic risk , how it originates and how it is affected by the structure of the networks of financial contracts among institutions worldwide , is only at the beginning @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of economic networks , systemic risk can even be conceived as an undesired externality arising from the strategic interaction of the agents @xcite .",
    "however , systemic risk is not only a financial or economic issue , it also appears in other social and technical systems .",
    "the spread of infectious diseases , the blackout of a power network , or the rupture of a fiber bundle are just some examples .",
    "systemic risk  in our perspective  is a macroscopic property of a system which emerges due to the nonlinear interactions of agents on a microscopic level . as in many other problems in statistical physics ,",
    "the question is how such a macroscopic property may emerge from local interactions , given some specific boundary conditions of the system .",
    "the main research question is then to predict the fraction of failed nodes @xmath1 in a system , either as a time dependent quantity or in equilibrium . here , we regard @xmath1 as a measure of systemic risk .",
    "in this paper we investigate systemic risk from a complex network perspective .",
    "thus , agents are represented by nodes and interactions by directed and weighted links of a network .",
    "each of the nodes is characterized by two discrete states @xmath2 , which can be interpreted as a susceptible and an infected state or , equivalently , as a healthy and a failed state . in most situations considered here ,",
    "the failure ( infection ) of a node exerts some form of stress on the neighbouring nodes which can possibly cause the failure ( infection ) of the neighbours , this way triggering a cascade , which means that node after node fails .",
    "this may happen via a redistribution mechanism , in which part of the stress acting on a node is transferred to neighboring nodes , which assumes that the total stress is conserved .",
    "there is another mechanism , however , where no such conserved quantity exist , for example in infection processes where the disease can be transferred to an unlimited number of nodes . in both mechanisms , the likelihood that a node fails increases with the number of failures in the proximity of the node .",
    "this is the essence of a contagion process .",
    "the specific dynamics may vary across applications , nevertheless there are common features which should be pointed out and systematically investigated .",
    "our paper contributes to this task by developing a general framework which encompass most of the existing models and allows to classify cascade models in three different categories .",
    "a number of works have investigated processes of this type , sometimes referred to as cascades or contagion. these were mostly dealing with interacting units with random mixing or , more recently , with fixed interaction structures corresponding to complex networks . on the one hand , there are models in which the failure dynamics is deterministic but the threshold , at which such a failure happens , is heterogeneous across nodes . for simplicity , we refer to these as _ cascade models _  even though , according to the discussion above , they also involve contagion . to this class",
    "belong some early works on electrical breakdown in random networks @xcite and more recent ones on the fiber bundle model ( fbm ) @xcite , on fractures @xcite , cascades in power grids @xcite , or cascades in sand piles  the bak - tang - wiesenfeld model ( btw ) @xcite .",
    "further work refers to congestion dynamics in networks , @xcite , cascades in financial systems @xcite and in social interactions @xcite , and overload distribution ( in abstract terms ) @xcite .",
    "the properties of self - organized criticality of some of these models are well understood @xcite .",
    "the presence of rare but large avalanches is of course relevant to systemic risk @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are models in which the failure of a given node is stochastic but the threshold at which contagion takes place is homogeneous across nodes . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to this class as _ contagion models _ , even though they can lead to cascades as well .",
    "the best known example is epidemic spreading ( sis ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "the properties of these model have been investigated in great detail on various network topologies , e.g. in the presence of correlations @xcite or bipatite structure @xcite . however , as we will see later , we can also include the voter model ( vm ) and its variants @xcite into this class .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the macroscopic behaviour of fbm and btw in a scale free topology is qualitatively similar to the one on regular and random graphs , the properties of sis are severely affected by the topology .",
    "the relation between cascading models and contagion models has not been investigated in depth , although some models interpolating between the two classes have been proposed @xcite    to relate these two model classes of cascades and contagion , in the following we develop a general model of cascades on networks where nodes are characterized by a two continuous variables , _ fragility _ and _ threshold_. nodes fail of their fragility exceed their individual heterogeneous threshold .",
    "the key variable is the net fragility @xmath3 , i.e. the difference between fragility and threshold .",
    "this variable is related to the notion of distance to default used in financial economics @xcite . by specifying the the fragility of a node in terms of other nodes fragility and/or other nodes failure state ,",
    "we are able to recover various existing cascade models .",
    "in particular , we identify three classes of cascade models , referred to as ` constant load ' , ` load redistribution ' , ` overload redistribution ' .",
    "the three classes differ , given that a node fails , in how the increase in fragility ( called here the ` load ' ) of connected nodes is specified .",
    "we discuss the differences and similarities among these classes also with respect to models from financial economics and sociology . for all of the three classes we derive mean - field recursive equation for the asymptotic fraction of failed nodes , @xmath0 . clearly , this variable depends on the initial distributions of both fragility and threshold across nodes .",
    "for instance , if no node is fragile enough to fail in the beginning , then no cascade is triggered .",
    "we thus compare how different models behave depending on the mean and variance of the initial distribution of @xmath3 across nodes .    as a further contribution , we extend the general framework to encompass models of stochastic contagion . in such a framework",
    ", the failure of a given node is a stochastic event depending both on the state of neighbourhood and on the individual threshold .",
    "we derive a general equation for the expected change of the fraction of failed nodes , from which one can recover the usual mean - field equations of the sis model , but interestingly also of the vm , as special cases .",
    "our work wishes to contribute to a better understanding of the relations between cascading models , contagion models and herding models on networks , from the point of view of systemic risk .",
    "in this section we develop a general framework to describe cascading processes on a network . this framework will be extended in sec . [",
    "sec : simple - cont - models ] to encompass also stochastic contagion models . on the microscopic side",
    ", we characterize each node @xmath4 of the network at time @xmath5 by a dynamic variable @xmath6 characterizing the failure state .",
    "the state is @xmath7 if the node has failed and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "other metaphors apply equally well to our model , e.g. ` infected / healthy ' , ` immune / susceptible ' , or ` broken / in function ' . on the macroscopic side , the system state at time @xmath5 is encoded in the @xmath9dimensional state vector @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the number of nodes .",
    "the macrodynamic variable of interest for systemic risk is the total _ fraction of failed nodes _ in the system @xmath12 if values of @xmath13 close to one are reached the system is prone to systemic risk . when trajectories always stay close to zero the system is free of systemic risk .",
    "for simplicity , in the following , we will consider models which converge in @xmath13 to stationary states @xmath0 .",
    "so , the _ final fraction of failed nodes _",
    "@xmath0 is our proxy for the systemic risk of the system .    in order to describe various existing models in a single framework",
    ", we assume that the failure state @xmath14 of each node is , in turn , determined by a continuous variable @xmath15 , representing the _ fragility _ of the node .",
    "a node remains healthy as long as @xmath16 , where the constant parameter @xmath17 represents the _ threshold _ above which the fragility determines the failure .",
    "conversely , the node fails if @xmath18 . in other words , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the heaviside function ( here meant to be @xmath21 if @xmath22 and @xmath23 if @xmath24 )",
    "the variable @xmath25 is called _",
    "net fragility_. as it is defined as the difference between fragility and failing threshold its absolute value has the same meaning of _ distance to default _ in finance , for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "notice that in the equation above time runs in discrete steps , consistently with failure being a discrete event .    this general framework can be applied to different models by specifying the functional form of fragility . as we will see , depending on the case under consideration",
    ", @xmath27 can be a function of the failure state vector @xmath10 and some static parameters , such as the network structure and the initial distribution of stress on the nodes .",
    "it can also be a function of the vector of fragility @xmath28 at previous times .",
    "the latter constitutes a coupled system with the vectors @xmath10 and @xmath29 as state variables . in any case , fragility depends on the current failure state and determines the new failures at the next time step .",
    "thus , cascades are triggered by the fact that failures induce other failures .",
    "specific models will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : specific - cascade - models ]    the interaction among nodes is specified by the ( possibly weighted ) adjacency matrix of the network @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "for specific models some restrictions to the adjacency matrix may apply , e.g. one may consider undirected links , no self - links or some condition on the weights . in this framework",
    "the adjacency matrix of the network influences the dynamics only as a static parameter , i.e. , we do not consider feedbacks from the state of a node on the link structure as in @xcite .",
    "if we assume a large number of nodes , it makes sense to look at the distribution of the net fragility @xmath32 , in terms of its density function @xmath33 . then from eqn .",
    "[ eq : xt ] and [ eq : unify ] it follows that the fraction of failed nodes at the next time step is given by @xmath34    in the cascading process new failures modify over time the values of fragility of other nodes .",
    "we can also formulate the dynamics in the space of density functions : @xmath35 if we know both the density function @xmath36 of the fragility at time @xmath5 and the density function @xmath37 of the failing threshold , we can write @xmath38 with ` @xmath39 ' denoting the convolution .",
    "the expression above assumes that fragility and threshold are stochastically independent across nodes .",
    "depending on the specific model , the functional operator @xmath40 , in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , may also include dependencies on other static parameters .",
    "the general idea is to find a density @xmath41 that is an attractive fix point of @xmath40 , so that the asymptotic fraction of failed nodes @xmath0 is obtained via eqn . .",
    "in many cascading processes on networks , the failure of a node causes a redistribution of load , stress or damage to the neighbouring nodes . in our framework , such redistribution of load can be seen as if a failure causes an increase of fragility in the neighbours . in the following ,",
    "we distinguish three different classes of models , denoted as ( i ) ` constant load ' , ( ii ) ` load redistribution ' , and ( iii ) ` overload redistribution ' .",
    "we keep the term ` load ' because it is more intuitive .",
    "we will show how these model classes are described in our unifying framework in terms of fragility and threshold , and how some models known in the literature fit into these classes .",
    "the differences in the cascading process across the models will be illustrated by taking the small undirected network of figure [ fig : all : init ] as an example .",
    "is represented by the shape of the node .",
    "a healthy node has @xmath42 , a failed one @xmath43 .",
    "a failing node is a node with @xmath42 but @xmath44 , so it will switch to the failed state in the next time step .",
    "nodes are labeled with capital letters . the level of fragility @xmath45 ( which changes over time ) is indicated inside each node .",
    "the failing threshold @xmath46 ( constant over time ) is indicated as superscript to the node .",
    "the color code specified in the colorbar refers to the value of net fragility @xmath47 . ]    for each model , we consider the same initial configuration with respect to the net fragility @xmath48 in which all nodes are healthy ( i.e. with @xmath48 negative ) . during the first time step , the value @xmath49 of node * c * is perturbed so that it fails .",
    "the subsequent time steps reveal how the propagation of failure occurs in the different models .      model class ( i ) ( ` constant load ' ) assumes that the failure of a node @xmath4 causes a predetermined increase of fragility to its neighbours . the term ` constant ' does not imply that the increase is uniform for all nodes ( on the contrary , some nodes may receive more load than others ) .",
    "it means that the increase in the fragility of node @xmath4 , when its neighbor @xmath50 fails , is the same regardless of the fragility of @xmath50 and of the situation in the rest of the system .",
    "we can now distinguish two cases .",
    "in the first case , the increase in fragility of a node @xmath4 is proportional to the fraction of neighbors that fail .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if the ties in the network represent for instance financial dependencies or social influence . in the second case ,",
    "the increase in fragility of a node @xmath4 , when neighbor @xmath50 fails , is inversely proportional to the number of neighbors of node @xmath50 . in other words , the load of @xmath50",
    "is shared equally among the neighbours and thus the more are its neighbours , the smaller is the additional load that each one , including @xmath4 , has to carry .",
    "we will refer to the first case as the _ inward variant _ of the model because the increase in fragility caused by the failure of one neighbour depends only on the in - degree of the node receiving the load .",
    "in contrast , we will refer to the second case as the _ outward variant _ , because the increase in fragility depends only on the out - degree of the failing node .",
    "we now start by casting in our framework the well known threshold model of collective behavior by granovetter @xcite .",
    "the model was developed in the context of social unrest , with people going on riot when the fraction of the population which is already on riot exceeds a given individual activation threshold .",
    "this model has been more recently reproposed as generic model of cascades on networks @xcite .",
    "we assume an initial vector of failing thresholds @xmath51 , and initial failing states @xmath52 for all @xmath4 . we define fragility as simply the fraction of failed neighbors , @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the set of all in - neighbors of @xmath4 in the network @xmath55 and @xmath56 being the cardinality of the set ( i.e. the in - degree of @xmath4 ) .",
    "this means that a node fails when the fraction of its failed neighbors exceeds its failing threshold .",
    "consequently , the initial fragility across nodes is zero @xmath57 for all @xmath4 and the dynamical equation ( [ eq : unify ] ) implies @xmath58 .",
    "thus , nodes with negative threshold correspond to initial failures at time step @xmath59 .",
    "interestingly , we can map our inward cascading model with constant load also to an economic model of bankruptcy cascades introduced in @xcite . in",
    "that model firms are connected in a network of credit and supply relations .",
    "each firm @xmath4 is characterised by a financial robustness @xmath60 which is a real number , where the condition @xmath61 determines the default of the firm .",
    "given a vector @xmath62 of initial values of robustness across firms and a vector @xmath10 of failure states , the robustness of firm @xmath4 at the next time step is computed as @xmath63 with @xmath54 being the set of in - neighbors of @xmath4 , @xmath56 the in - degree of @xmath4 , and @xmath64 a parameter measuring the intensity of the damage caused by the failure .",
    "new vectors of failing state vectors and robustness are then computed iteratively until no new failures occur .",
    "mathematically , this process is equivalent to our inward variant model specified by eqn . .",
    "the equivalence is obtained by defining fragility @xmath45 as in eqn . and",
    "by setting @xmath65 we note that the model specified in @xcite also includes a dynamics on the robustness inbetween two cascades of failures , which is not part of our framework .",
    "let us now turn to the outward variant of the constant load model .",
    "it can be described within our framework by defining fragility as @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the out - degree of node @xmath50 .",
    "if the network is undirected and regular , i.e. , all nodes have the same degree , the inward and the outward model variants , are equivalent and lead to identical dynamics .",
    "however , if the degree is heterogeneous , then the number and the identity of the nodes involved in the cascade differ , as shown in the example of figure [ fig : fdfail3 ] .    .",
    "initially , node * c * is forced to failure by setting its failure threshold to zero .",
    "subsequent time steps in the evolution of the cascade are represented downward in the figure . ]",
    "notice that the influence of high and low out - degree nodes interchange in the two variants , as well as the vulnerability of high and low in - degree nodes . in the inward variant ,",
    "high in - degree nodes are more protected from contagion as they only fail when many neighbours have failed . in turn ,",
    "when a high out - degree node fails , it causes a big damage if it has many neighbors with low in - degree .",
    "in contrast , in the outward variant , a failing low out - degree node generates a larger impact on its neighbours since the load is distributed among fewer nodes .",
    "thus , a high in - degree node is more exposed to contagion if it is connected to low out - degree nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "a failing high out - degree node does not cause much damage to its neighbors because the damage gets divided between many nodes . in the examples reported in the figures ,",
    "the network is undirected and in - degree and out - degree coincide .",
    "still the roles of high - degree and low - degree nodes interchange as discussed above .    as another important difference between the two variants ,",
    "the maximal fragility is bounded by the value one in the inward variant , while it is bounded by the number of nodes @xmath11 in the outward variant , which is realized in a star network .",
    "further , both variants strongly differ regarding the impact of the position of the initial failure .",
    "figure [ fig : fdfail9 ] ( in appendix [ sec : further - examples ] ) shows an example , where node * i * initially fails ( instead of node * c * in figure [ fig : fdfail3 ] ) . the cascade triggered by that event is larger in the outward variant than in the inward variant , in contrast to what seen in figure [ fig : fdfail3 ] .",
    "eventually , figure [ fig : fdfail5 ] illustrates the dynamics of a cascade triggered by the failure of node * e * , which has the highest degree .",
    "this results in a full cascade in the inward variant , while there is no cascade at all in the outward variant .",
    "this observation illustrates the different influence of nodes with high degree in the inward and the outward variant , as explained above .      model class ( ii ) ` load redistribution ' is our second class of cascading models . in this class",
    "all nodes are initially subject to a certain amount of load .",
    "actually , in this model class fragility coincides with load .",
    "when a node @xmath4 fails , all of its load is redistributed among the first neighbours .",
    "this mechanism differs from class ( i ) because in class ( ii ) the increase in fragility among the neighbours of @xmath4 depends on the actual value of @xmath4 s fragility and not just on the fact that it exceeds the threshold .",
    "the damage caused by one failure can thus not be specified a priori .",
    "models belonging to this class include the fiber bundle model ( fbm ) @xcite and models of cascades in power grids @xcite . in some cases it is possible to define the total load of the system , which",
    ", additionally , but not necessarily , may be a conserved quantity .",
    "for instance , in the fbm a constant force is applied to a bundle of fibers each of which is characterized by a breaking threshold . when a fiber breaks , the load it carries is redistributed equally to all the remaining fibers , so the total load is conserved by definition . in the context of networks ,",
    "a node represents a fiber and if the node fails the load is transferred locally to the first neighbours in the network .",
    "an analogy to power grids is also possible , with nodes representing power plants , links representing transmission lines , fragility representing demand and threshold representing capacity , respectively .",
    "there are , several ways to specify the mechanism of local load transfer .",
    "a first variant is the fbm with local load sharing ( lls ) and load conservation , investigated in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this variant as llsc . despite the fact that load sharing is local , total load",
    "is strictly conserved at any time , due to the condition that links to failed nodes remain able to transfer load ( in other words , links do not fail ) .",
    "a second variant implies load shedding instead , and we refer to it as llss . in this variant ,",
    "all links to failed nodes are removed and the load of a failing node is transferred only to the first neighbours that are not about to fail .",
    "these are the nodes that are healthy and below the threshold and thus will be still alive at the next time ( although they may reach the threshold meanwhile ) .",
    "however , if there are no surviving neighbours , the load is eventually lost ( or shed ) .    in the first variant we can cast the fbm - lls @xcite and extend it to the case of heterogeneous load and directed networks .    from now on ,",
    "we interpret ` load ' as ` fragility ' , and ` capacity ' as failing threshold. let @xmath68 be the vector of initial fragility ( corresponding to the initial load carried by each node ) , and @xmath51 the vector of failing thresholds ( or maximal capacity ) .",
    "( for comparison : in @xcite the threshold @xmath46 for node @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath69 with values taken from a uniform distribution between zero and one .",
    "the load of each node is the same and called @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being the total load . )",
    "we define @xmath72 as the set of healthy nodes which are reachable from node @xmath4 following directed paths consisting only of failed nodes ( except @xmath4 ) .",
    "let @xmath73 be the cardinality of such set .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath74 to be the set of nodes from which node @xmath4 can be reached along directed paths consisting of failed nodes ( except @xmath4 ) .",
    "both sets of nodes defined above have to be computed dynamically based on the current vector of failing states @xmath75 and the network .",
    "finally , given the initial fragility vector @xmath76 , the failure state vector @xmath10 , and the network @xmath55 , we define the fragility of node @xmath4 at time @xmath5 in the llsc variant as @xmath77 we add that for an undirected network and uniform initial load , such a definition becomes equivalent to the _ load concentration _ factor of node @xmath4 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "the assumption that links do not break and remain able to transfer load is not always satisfactory .",
    "some models have thus investigated the llss variant of the model in which the load is transferred only to the surviving first neighbours @xcite . in this case",
    "the load transfer is truly local and there is no transmission along a chain of failed nodes .",
    "this implies that during a cascade of failures , at some point in time the network might split into disconnected components which can not transfer load to each other .",
    "in particular , if one of these subnetworks fails entirely , all the load carried by this subnetwork is shed .    as a consequence of the llss assumption ,",
    "fragility now is not just a function of the current state vector @xmath10 and some static parameters ( such as the network matrix and the initial fragility @xmath76 ) .",
    "in contrast , it has to be defined through a dynamic process as a function of the fragility vector at previous time @xmath5 , according to the following equation : @xmath78 with @xmath79 being the set of in - neighbors of @xmath4 which fail at time @xmath5 ( but have not already failed ! ) , and @xmath80 the set of out - neighbors of @xmath50 which remain healthy at time @xmath81 @xmath82    thus , eqn .",
    "is well defined unless @xmath80 is empty . in this case",
    ", there is no healthy neighbour of @xmath50 to which the load can be transferred , thus the load has to be shed .",
    "the remaining healthy nodes remain unaffected .",
    "figure [ fig : fbfail3 ] illustrates , as an example , the different outcomes of the dynamics in the llsc and llss variants .",
    "the initial load is set to one for all nodes , thus the total load on the system is nine .",
    "the values of the threshold are set in order to have the same values of @xmath83 at each node as in the example of figure [ fig : all : init ] . as in figure",
    "[ fig : fdfail3 ] , we set the failing threshold of node * c * to one in order to trigger an initial failure .",
    "on one hand , we could expect that cascades triggered by the failure of one node are systematically wider in the llsc variant than in the llss variant because in the first one the total load is conserved . on the other hand , in the llsc , the fragility is redistributed also to indirect neighbours thus leading to a smaller increase of fragility per node and therefore possibly to smaller cascades .",
    "in fact there seems to be no apparent systematic result , the outcome being dependent on the network structure and the position of the initial failure . in the example shown in figure [ fig : fbfail3 ]",
    "the cascade stops sooner in the llsc variant than in the llss one , due to the rebalancing of load across the network .",
    "in other cases , however , if for instance node * e * initially fails , we find that the load shedding has a stronger impact and the cascade is smaller in the llss case .",
    "we conclude our classification with class ( iii ) ` overload redistribution ' .",
    "when a node @xmath4 fails in these models , only the difference between the load and the capacity is redistributed among the first neighbours . actually , the overload of a node is its net fragility .",
    "this class is more realistic in applications , where a failed node can still hold its maximum load and only has to redistribute its overload .",
    "the eisenberg - noe model is an important example of an economic model in which firms are connected via a network of liabilities @xcite .",
    "when the total liabilities of a firm @xmath4 exceed its expected total cash flow ( consisting of the operating cash flow from external sources and the liabilities of the other firms towards @xmath4 ) , the firm goes bankrupt . when a new bankruptcy is recognized the expected payments from others decline , but they do not vanish entirely . thus the loss spreading to the creditors is mitigated .",
    "with respect to our framework , we can identify the total liability minus the currently expected payments ( from the liabilities of others ) with fragility .",
    "similarly , operating cash flow corresponds to the failing threshold .",
    "the relation between the eisenberg - noe model and the overload redistribution class is discussed more in detail in appendix [ sec : eisenbergnoe ] .",
    "therefore , we adapt the two variants of load redistribution defined as llsc and llss in section [ sec : models - with - redistr - of - load ] to the case of overload redistribution by subtracting the threshold value in the nominator of eqns .",
    "[ eq : phi : fiberllsc ] and [ eq : phi : fiberllss ] .",
    "we have @xmath84 as definition of fragility in the llsc version when links remain , and @xmath85 as dynamical equation of fragility in the llss version when links break .    using our small example of figure [ fig : all : init ] ,",
    "the cascading dynamics for the model class ( iii ) is presented in figure [ fig : fbofail3 ] . in general , as we will see in section [ sec : macr - reform ] this class of models leads to much smaller cascades , compared to class ( ii ) . in this example , we have set the initial fragility of node * c * high enough so that a large cascade is triggered .        a very high initial overload is needed to trigger a cascade of failures because this overload is the only amount which is transferred through the whole system . on a failure nothing new",
    "is added to the total amount , because the node stays with its maximum capacity .",
    "notice that the models of overload redistribution are invariant to joint shifts in the initial fragility @xmath76 and in the failing threshold @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , a system with @xmath86 and @xmath87 leads to the same trajectory of failure state @xmath10 and fragility @xmath88 .",
    "thus , it is enough to study the model with @xmath89 without loss of generality .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the different classes of cascading models lead to a diverse behaviour , at least in small scale examples , even if initial conditions for net fragility are the same . in this section , by studying simple mean - field approximations of the processes we find that there are significant differences also at the macroscopic level . in order to compare the different model classes under the same conditions , we have set the probability density functions @xmath90 of initial values of the net fragility to be equal for all models . for the cases ( i ) constant load , and ( iii ) overload redistribution we set @xmath91 .",
    "notice , that we can set @xmath89 in case ( iii ) without loss of generality . for case ( ii )",
    "load redistribution , instead , it is necessary to have @xmath92 ( otherwise there is no load to redistribute ) and we have @xmath93 .",
    "we further assume that the initial fragility @xmath76 is uniform across nodes in model class ( ii ) .",
    "even a basic mean - field approach allows for an interesting comparison of the three model classes .",
    "to do so , we replace the distribution of fragility at time @xmath5 , with the delta function @xmath94 centered on the mean fragility @xmath95 .",

    "the mean - field approach , could now be refined in various ways , in order to take into account , for instance , the cases of non - fully connected network , heterogeneous degree , or even degree - degree correlation , following the methods that have been applied to epidemic spreading models @xcite .",

    "the fragility of a node now takes values in the discrete set @xmath155 .",

    "we first notice that in those cases the transition from state @xmath227 to @xmath228 is not really conditional to the state at previous time .",
    "actually , in these models a node changes to a certain state with a probability which is independent of its current state .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our framework is general enough to cover cases in which failure is really conditional on @xmath75 .    for the models discussed in section [ sec : specific - cascade - models ] , we can assume @xmath229 and thus @xmath230 , and further @xmath201 , @xmath231 .",
    "we have then @xmath232 we now set @xmath233 , which implies that the transition probability in equation ( [ eq : transition - prob ] ) tends to the heaviside function : @xmath234 since , for any real function @xmath235 holds @xmath236 we obtain @xmath237 because of @xmath238 , this finally yields @xmath239 eqn .",
    "( [ eq : master8 ] ) coincides with eqn .",
    "( [ eq : xmacro ] ) .",
    "in order to recover models of herding and stochastic contagion , we instead keep the stochastic nature of the failure but we assume that the failure threshold is the same across nodes , @xmath240 , @xmath241 . in a mean field approximation , we replace the individual fragility with the average one , so that also @xmath211 is constant across the nodes @xmath242 .",
    "then the probability density of @xmath3 in equation ( [ eq : master4 ] ) is equivalent to a delta function and the integral over @xmath243 drops .",
    "the macroscopic mean - field equation then reads @xmath244 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : master5 ] ) will be the starting point for discussing specific contagion models in sections [ sec : voter ] , [ sec : sis ] .",
    "the linear voter model ( lvm ) is a very simple model of herding behavior .",
    "the dynamics is given by the following update rule : a voter , i.e. a node @xmath245 of the network , is selected at random and adopts the state of a randomly chosen nearest neighbor @xmath246 .",
    "after @xmath11 such update events , time is increased by 1 . the probability to choose a node @xmath50 in state 1 from the neighborhood of node",
    "@xmath4 is proportional to the frequency of nodes with state 1 in that neighborhood , @xmath247 ( and conversely for state 0 ) .",
    "consequently , the transition probability towards the opposite state is proportional to the local frequency of the opposite state .",
    "it is also independent of the current state of the node .",
    "@xmath248 in order to match this dynamics within our framework , we consider values of @xmath196 of the order of 1 . from equation ( [ eq : transition - prob ] ) ,",

    "the fragility equals the local frequencies @xmath247 of infected nodes , and does not depend on the node itself .",
    "if a majority of nodes in the neighborhood has failed , this more likely leads to a failed state of node @xmath4 ; if the failed nodes are the minority , this can lead to a transition into the healthy state . since the fragility coincides with fraction of neighbours in state 1 ( or 0 )",
    ", vm fits in the first model class described in sec .",
    "[ sec : models - with - constant - damage ] , with the specificity that the failure process is stochastic and the threshold is homogeneous across nodes .    as a consistency check ,",
    "if we assume for one moment the failure process to be deterministic , one could directly apply eqn .",
    "( [ eq : recur : fd ] ) .",
    "since the probability distribution of the threshold would be trivially a delta function @xmath255 , its cumulative distribution would be the heaviside function @xmath256 .",
    "this would imply that the dynamics reaches @xmath257 as stable fix point as soon as @xmath258 and viceversa for @xmath259 .",
    "coming back to the usual stochastic vm , in order to obtain the mean - field dynamics , we now approximate @xmath260 with @xmath13 , i.e. we replace @xmath261 , @xmath262 in equation ( [ eq : master5 ] ) .",

    "is a non - linear function of the fraction of failed nodes in the neighborhood : @xmath264 @xmath265 and @xmath266 are frequency dependent functions which describe the non - linear response of a node on the fraction of failed nodes in the neighborhood .",

    "in fact , it is well known that the global outcome of the lvm leads to global failure with a probability equal to the initial fraction of infected nodes , @xmath136 . in other words , if we run a simulation with e.g. @xmath269 for 100 times , then in 30 cases we will reach a state of global failure , whereas in 70 cases , no failure at all will prevail .",
    "this differs from the case of the cascading models described in sect .",
    "[ sec : specific - cascade - models ] , in which the mean field dynamics gives us some more information about individual realizations .    in the non - linear case ( @xmath270 , @xmath271 ) , different scenarios arise depending on the nonlinearity . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that even a small non - linearity may lead to either states where global failure is always reached , or to states with a coexistence of failed and healthy nodes .",
    "it is worth noticing that both of these scenarios are obtained with _ positive frequency dependence _ , i.e. a transition probability to fail that increases monotonically with the local frequency @xmath272 .",
    "thus , small deviations in the nonlinear response can either enhance systemic risk , or completely prevent it .",
    "the sis model @xcite is the most known model of epidemic spreading . on the microlevel",

    "the parameter @xmath273 measures the infectiousness of the disease in case of contact with an infected node .",
    "this means that the effective transition probability of node @xmath4 from healthy to infected state is proportional to the probability @xmath156 that a neighbour is infected times the degree @xmath274 of the node .",
    "indeed , the larger the number of contacts , the more likely it is to be in contact with an infected node . on the other hand ,",
    "failed nodes recover spontaneously with probability @xmath275 .",
    "the transition probabilities are then as follows : @xmath276 with @xmath277 .",
    "we do not redefine , as usually done , the infection rate as @xmath278 with @xmath279 , because we want to cover the case @xmath280 , as we will see below .",
    "we interpret of course infection state as failure state .",

    "\\gamma ' \\left[1-\\beta ' ( \\phi-\\theta'_{i})\\right ] & = & 2 \\delta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that our framework recovers the transition probabilities of the sis model , provided that : @xmath281    in order to understand the relation of sis with the other models , we can approximate the probability @xmath156 that a node fails with the fraction of failed neighbours @xmath282 .",
    "the resulting expression for the fragility , @xmath283 , is proportional to the fraction of failed nodes as in model class ( i ) of sec .",
    "[ sec : models - with - constant - damage ] .",

    "this feature makes the biggest difference between the sis model and the cascade models studied in the previous sections , apart of course from the fact that the contagion process is stochastic and the threshold homogeneous .",
    "another important feature that emerges is the asymmetry in the transition probabilities between healthy and failed state and backwards .    in order to derive a macroscopic dynamics",
    ", we apply the mean - field approximation @xmath284 and we assume a homogeneous network with @xmath285 for all nodes . starting from equation ( [ eq : master5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath286 the last negative term in the r.h.s . of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : sis - growth ] ) implies that there is no global spreading of infection if @xmath287 and the only stable fix point is @xmath288 .",
    "for @xmath289 there is a unique stable fix point with @xmath290 .",
    "as it is well known , the existence of a critical infection rate @xmath291 does not hold , however , if , instead of the mean - field limit with homogeneous degree , a heterogeneous degree distribution of the nodes is assumed @xcite .",
    "the implications of degree heterogeneity and degree - degree correlation in epidemic spreading have been investigated in a number of works @xcite .",
    "the si model , in which no transition into the healthy state is possible , is recovered setting additionally @xmath280 .",
    "we then obtain the logistic growth equation : @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the only stable fix point of the dynamics .",
    "any initial disturbance of a healthy state eventually leads to complete infection .",
    "we conclude by noting that , despite its simplicity , the si model has been used to describe a number of real contagious processes , such as the spread of innovations @xcite or herding behavior in donating money @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the mean - field interaction was provided by the mass media . in other words , because of the constant and homogeneous information about other people s donations , the individual transition depends on the global ( averaged ) frequency of donations instead of the local one .",
    "interestingly , it could be shown that in the particular example of epidemic donations , the time scale depends itself on time , indicating a slowing down of the dynamics due to a decrease in public interest .",
    "in this paper , we wish to clarify the meaning and the emergence of systemic risk in networks with respect to several existing models . to unify their description ,",
    "we propose a framework in which nodes are characterized ( 1 ) by a discrete failure state @xmath179 ( healthy or failed ) and ( 2 ) by a continuous variable , the _ net fragility _ , @xmath25 , capturing the difference between fragility @xmath294 of the node and its failing threshold @xmath17 . by choosing an appropriate definition of fragility in terms of the failure state and/or the fragility of neighbouring nodes , we are able to recover , as special cases , several cascade models as well as contagion models previously studied in the literature .",
    "our paper contributes to the investigation of these models in several ways .",
    "first of all , we have provided a novel framework to cover both cascade and contagion models in a deterministic approach , which is further suitable to be generalized also to the stochastic case .",
    "secondly , our framework allows us to unify a number of existing , but seemingly unrelated models , pointing out to their commonalities and differences .",
    "thirdly , we are able to identify three different model classes , which are each characterized by a specific mechanism of transferring fragility between different nodes .",
    "these are ( i ) constant load , ( ii ) load redistribution , and ( iii ) overload redistribution.    systemic risk , within our framework , is defined as the stable fraction of failed nodes @xmath0 in the system . as @xmath295 denotes the complete breakdown of a system , we are interested in trajectories of the system where @xmath0 is much below one . in order to determine these trajectories , in this paper we derive a _ macroscopic dynamics _ for @xmath13 based on the microscopic dynamics . as a major contribution of this paper ,",
    "we are able to find , for each of the three classes , macroscopic equations for the final fraction of failed nodes in the mean - field limit .    in order to compare the systemic risk between the three classes ,",
    "we have studied the macroscopic dynamics of each of them with the same initial conditions .",
    "most importantly , we found that the differences on the microscopic level translate into important differences on the macroscopic level , which are visualized in a phase diagram of systemic risk .",
    "this indicates , for each of the model classes , which given initial conditions result into what total fraction of failure .",
    "this way we could verify that , for instance , in class ( ii ) there is a first - order transition between regions of high systemic risk and regions with low systemic risk .",
    "in contrast , class ( i ) displays such a sharp transition only in some smaller part of the phase space , while class ( iii ) does not display any abrupt transition at all .",
    "such an insight helps us to understand whether and for which parameters small variations of initial conditions may lead to an abrupt collapse of the whole system , in contrast to a gradual increase of systemic risk .",
    "in addition to the macro dynamics , we have also investigated the different model classes on the microscopic level .",
    "a number of network examples made clear how the different transfer mechanisms affect the microdynamics of cascades .",
    "as an interesting insight , we could demonstrate that the role of nodes with high degree change depending on type of load transfer . in the inwards variant of first class model , high degree nodes",
    "are more protected from contagion , whereas in the outwards variant of the same class , they become more exposed to contagion if they are connected to many low degree nodes ( which holds for disassortative networks ) .",
    "furthermore , we could point out that the results strongly depend on the position of the initially failing node .",
    "a systematic analysis identifying the crucial nodes from a systemic risk point of view is left for future work .",
    "finally we have extended our general framework so to encompass models of stochastic contagion , as known from vm and sis .",
    "both of these models belong to the first class , but differently from the models studied in section [ sec : models - with - constant - damage ] , the threshold is homogeneous and the failure is stochastic .",
    "hence , it becomes more clear how these established models of herding behavior and epidemic spreading are linked to the cascade models discussed in the literature .",
    "our work could be extended in several ways .",
    "first , one could apply techniques to deal with heterogeneous degree distributions to the three classes of cascading model , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : specific - cascade - models ] . this could be carried out also in the presence of degree - degree correlation , as recently discussed for contagion models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one could investigate more in detail the case of both heterogeneous threshold and stochastic failures .",
    "compared to the simple sis , it seems more realistic to assume that the probability of contagion depends on an intrinsic heterogeneous property of the nodes ( the threshold ) .",
    "such heterogeneity could also play a crucial role , as it has been found for the heterogeneity in the degree @xcite .",
    "a last remark is devoted to the discussion of systemic risk . in our paper , we have provided mean - field equations to calculate the total fraction of failed node in a system , which we regard as a measure of systemic risk .",
    "this implies that systemic risk is associated with a system state of global failure , i.e. there is no risk anymore , as almost all nodes already failed .",
    "in contrast , it could be also appropriate to define systemic risk as a situation , where the system has not failed yet , but small changes in the initial conditions or fluctuations during the evolution may lead to its complete collapse .",
    "our general framework has already contributed insight into this problem , by identifying those areas in the ( mean - field ) phase diagram where we can observe a sharp transition between a globally healthy and a globally failed system .",
    "this is related to precursors of a crisis as it identifies parameter constellations to make a system vulnerable that looks apparently healthy .",
    "on the other hand , using our approach we were able to assess that for certain transfer mechanisms such an abrupt change in the global state is not observed at all  which means that systems operating under some conditions are less vulnerable to small changes .",

    "an interesting model of contagion which has not been investigated in the econophysics literature is the one developed by eisenberg and noe @xcite .",
    "it introduces a so called fictitious default algorithm as a clearing mechanism in a financial system of liabilities .",
    "when some agents in the system can not meet fully their obligations , the task of computing how much each one owes to the other becomes nontrivial in presence of cycles in the network of liabilities .",
    "the basic assumptions of the clearing mechanism are ( i ) limited liability ( a firm need not spend more than it has ) , ( ii ) absolute priority of debt over cash ( a firm has to spend all available cash to satisfy debt claims first ) , ( iii ) no seniority ( all claims have the same priority ) .",
    "a financial system of @xmath11 firms is described by a vector of total obligations @xmath296 , a matrix of relative liabilities @xmath55 , and a vector of operating cash flows @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath297 is the total amount of liabilities firm @xmath4 has towards other firms , @xmath298 specifies what fraction of its own total obligations firm @xmath4 owes to firm @xmath50 , and @xmath46 determines the liquid amount of money of firm @xmath4 .",
    "thus , @xmath299 is the nominal liability @xmath4 has to @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix @xmath55 is row - stochastic , which means all entries are non - negative and rows sum up to one .",
    "this condition ensures that individual obligations sum up to the total obligations @xmath300 .",
    "the expected payments to firm @xmath4 from its debtors is thus : @xmath301 if it happens that the total cash flow , i.e. , the expected repayments of others plus operating cash - flow , is less than the total obligations , i.e. @xmath302 firm @xmath4 can not meet its obligation in full and defaults .",
    "this implies a reduction of the expected payments to its creditors , which might in turn default as a second - order effect , and so on .",
    "this makes this model close to the class of overload redistribution because the expected payments of a node do not vanish entirely when it fails .",
    "the fictitious default algorithm defined in @xcite consists of finding a clearing vector @xmath303 of total payments which fulfills the equation @xmath304 for all @xmath4 . as shown in @xcite , using mild assumptions , such a clearing vector exists and is unique and the fictitious default algorithm , with @xmath305 , is well defined .",
    "the sequence @xmath306 represents a decreasing sequence of clearing vector candidates which terminates in at most @xmath11 steps at the clearing vector . the new clearing vector candidate @xmath307 is computed from a given candidate @xmath306 taking into account the first order defaults given clearing vector candidate @xmath306 , but not the second order defaults .",
    "these are checked in the successive time steps .",
    "following our general framework presented in section [ sec : form - model - cont ] , we can define fragility as @xmath308 which is the amount of debt which has to be covered by the operating cash flow @xmath46 , given the current candidate for the clearing vector @xmath306 . from @xmath306 , @xmath296 , @xmath55 , and @xmath51 we can determine the failing state @xmath309 as in equation ( [ eq : unify ] ) as @xmath310 given a clearing vector candidate @xmath306 , the _ value of the equity _ of firm @xmath4 is given by @xmath311 which is the operating cash flow plus the expected amount of payments received by others minus the payment to others which are possible , given the currently expected payments from the other .",
    "a new clearing vector candidate @xmath307 is computed from @xmath306 by determining the failing state @xmath312 .",

    "if successful , the algorithm runs until a clearing vector is found which gives that the value of the equity is zero ( and not negative ) for a firm in default , and positive for a non - defaulting firm .",
    "at least one non - defaulting firm should be found by the fictitious default algorithm , which means that there is at least one firm @xmath4 for which it holds @xmath313 holds . if not , then the clearing vector candidates diverge toward @xmath314 , and the algorithm fails .",
    "this represents a full break down of the financial system .",
    "the relation between this model and our third model class is not straightforward because the new clearing vector candidate @xmath306 is not necessarily always uniquely defined by the current fragility @xmath29 as given in .",
