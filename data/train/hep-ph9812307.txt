    "the solar neutrino problem , the fact that the detected neutrino flux from the sun is less than the predicted flux , has been known for decades since the pioneering work of r. davis in the homestake mine @xcite . since then , substantial progress has been made .",
    "the kamiokande collaboration confirmed that the neutrinos are indeed coming from the sun in a real - time experiment with directional capability @xcite .",
    "both the kamiokande and super - kamiokande collaborations @xcite also reported a depletion of the predicted flux .",
    "the gallex and sage experiments , which are sensitive to the ( dominant ) @xmath5 component of the solar neutrino flux @xcite , directly related to the solar luminosity , also found a depletion of the predicted flux . without relying on the standard solar model calculations",
    ", one can conclude from the data that the electron neutrino flux from the @xmath6 is almost totally depleted ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the credibility of the standard solar model calculations has been verified by their agreement with the helioseismology data at better than one percent level @xcite .",
    "these facts amount to strong evidence of new physics in the neutrino sector , in particular neutrino oscillations .    even though the evidence for a `` real '' ( solar model independent ) solar neutrino problem is very strong ,",
    "it is not yet completely established .",
    "first , one needs to rely on ( at least ) two experiments to conclude that there is , model independently , a problem",
    ". it would be far more convincing if one could see a signal of neutrino oscillations in a single experiment .",
    "second , all of the experiments have been of the disappearance type , where one sees a depletion of the predicted flux . given the difficulty of neutrino experiments and of theoretical calculations of nuclear cross sections , an appearance experiment would be much more convincing evidence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the sno experiment @xcite will go a long way towards resolving the issues raised above .",
    "it is designed to measure the solar @xmath7b neutrino flux via the charged - current ( cc ) reaction ( @xmath8 ) and the neutral - current ( nc ) reaction ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) . assuming both of these processes can be well understood",
    ", a difference between the two measured fluxes would imply that there are neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux which are not of the electron type ; one may even call this an appearance experiment of @xmath3 .",
    "there is also an additional oscillation signature in the possible distortion of the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "however , if for some astrophysical and/or nuclear - physics reason the @xmath11b neutrino flux is lower than currently predicted , the sno experiment may be unable to see an oscillation signature .",
    "another possible concern is that the measurement of the cc / nc ratio involves the separate calibration of the efficiencies in the cc and nc processes .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the current data are correct and the solar neutrinos indeed oscillate ( even with an arbitrary @xmath7b flux ) , there must be neutrinos other than @xmath2 in the @xmath12be neutrino flux , and their detection would be an unambiguous signal of neutrino oscillations . the @xmath12be neutrinos will be studied using @xmath0-@xmath1 elastic scattering at borexino @xcite , and possibly also at kamland @xcite , if the background from natural radioactivity can be sufficiently suppressed .    in this letter , we study the prospect of establishing the @xmath3 component of the solar neutrino flux in a completely solar model - independent analysis .",
    "we point out that the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum is different for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . by fitting the shape of the electron energy spectrum , one can determine the fraction of @xmath3 in the solar neutrino flux , without relying on the predicted neutrino flux from the standard solar model .",
    "we discuss both the @xmath12be neutrinos at borexino or kamland and the @xmath11b neutrinos at super - kamiokande or sno .",
    "this type of model - independent study seems to be difficult with the @xmath11b neutrinos at super - kamiokande or sno , but borexino or kamland should have enough statistics to do the analysis with the @xmath12be neutrinos .    the sensitivity to the @xmath3 component is a strong function of the @xmath2 survival probability . in the parameter range of the small - angle msw solution , one can see the @xmath3 component of the @xmath12be neutrino flux at more than 95% confidence level with two years of borexino running , if the background is sufficiently small . under the same conditions",
    ", the sensitivity at kamland would be even greater .",
    "the differential cross - section for elastic @xmath13-@xmath1 scattering ( @xmath10 ) is known @xcite : @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the recoil electron kinetic energy and @xmath19 is the incoming neutrino energy in the lab frame . from the kinematics ,",
    "@xmath20 is related to the recoil electron scattering angle @xmath21 by @xmath22 and ranges from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the sign in the definition of @xmath25 depends on the flavor of the incoming neutrino : it is plus for @xmath26 and minus for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 for active ) .    in the presence of oscillations ,",
    "the @xmath20 distribution is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the oscillation probability for @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    to illustrate the difference in the recoil electron kinetic energy spectra for different incoming neutrinos , we plot in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] spectra for two neutrino energies , @xmath34  mev ( for @xmath11b neutrinos ) and @xmath35  mev ( for @xmath12be neutrinos ) .",
    "the curves are all normalized to unit area such that their shapes can be compared .",
    "the @xmath36 vs @xmath37 difference is more prominent at higher energies , but is not negligible even for the @xmath12be energy .",
    "the central idea of this letter is the following .",
    "one should fit the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum with an _ arbitrary normalization , _ both for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the presence of a non - zero component of @xmath38-@xmath1 scattering is the evidence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this test does not depend on the theoretical prediction of the neutrino flux , and hence is independent of solar model and nuclear physics calculations .",
    "it can be regarded as an `` appearance '' experiment of @xmath3 , similar to the sno experiment .",
    "the rest of this letter is devoted to discussing under what conditions such a test can be performed .",
    "we will analyze the recoil electron kinetic energy distributions for the case of solar neutrinos produced by the electron capture reaction @xmath4be @xmath39li @xmath40 . because of the @xmath41 kinematics the neutrinos are mono - energetic , which greatly simplifies our analyses.li nucleus , namely @xmath42  mev ( branching fractions @xmath43 vs @xmath44 ) .",
    "we focus only on the higher energy value because the lower energy one does not produce recoil electron energies above the borexino threshold of 250  kev . ]",
    "we mostly focus on borexino , because it is the only approved experiment which will specifically study the @xmath12be neutrinos .",
    "we do comment on a possible statistically superior sample from kamland .",
    "we find that borexino can in principle show the existence of a @xmath38 component in the @xmath12be solar neutrino flux at the two - sigma level after two years of running , if the background is negligible .",
    "following the idea presented in the previous section , we will not rely on the overall rate of the scattering process , which depends on the theoretical prediction of the flux . to be completely model - independent ,",
    "we use only the shape of the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum by allowing the normalization to float in the fit . when discussing the sensitivity of borexino or kamland , however",
    ", we do need to use some expected neutrino flux ; for this purpose , we use the standard solar model ( bp95 ) @xcite , plus the effect of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the simulated `` data '' sample will consist of ten @xmath20 bins , with the number of events in the @xmath45-th bin given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",
    "we take the detection threshold energy to be 250  kev ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath50 ) for borexino , which is limited by the @xmath51c radioactivity background .",
    "note that for the borexino @xmath20 range , @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is the number of events predicted by the standard solar model for borexino . in the upcoming analysis",
    ", we will only consider statistical uncertainties , and no background .",
    "a two - parameter @xmath54 fit of the `` data '' events was performed , by varying both @xmath55 and @xmath30 ( two parameters ) .",
    "this is equivalent to fitting the data to a linear combination of the @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath38-@xmath1 differential scattering cross sections with arbitrary normalizations ( two parameters ) .",
    "[ fit](a ) shows the extracted @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 for two years of borexino running .",
    "a nonzero value of @xmath56 implies the presence of @xmath31 oscillations .",
    "the analysis indicates that , for two years of borexino running , the active neutrino component can be seen at the one - sigma level if @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath59 active neutrino oscillations would yield more than a two - sigma effect .",
    "that is the case for the so - called small angle msw solution , which predicts @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called large angle msw solution predicts @xmath61 , and the vacuum oscillations ( the `` just - so '' solution ) @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "a different type of analysis can be performed , with very similar results .",
    "this different analysis might prove to be useful in order to deal with the background , if it is not negligible .",
    "the integrated observable @xmath63 is defined by @xmath64 @xmath65 is the number of observed events @xmath66 , and the sub(super)script @xmath67 refers to the degree of the polynomial multiplying the data . in the absence of active neutrinos in the solar flux , @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath63 is defined in such a way that the contribution of any background with a flat @xmath20 distribution cancels .    in fig .",
    "[ deltaa](a ) we plot @xmath63 as a function of @xmath57 , for the same conditions considered in the two - parameter fit .",
    "the results are very similar to the ones obtained earlier , as expected .",
    "even though the borexino experiment should have enough statistics for a model - independent test of the @xmath38 component in the solar @xmath12be flux , the experimental effort will still be very challenging .",
    "the main concern is radioactive background from rn , u and th .",
    "an accurate energy calibration is also crucial .",
    "our simple analysis is valid only when the background is sufficiently small in the signal range .",
    "if the background turns out to be significant , one can still use the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum if ( 1 ) the background can be reliably subtracted and ( 2 ) the statistical significance can be kept after the background subtraction .",
    "the first assumption is rather difficult to justify .",
    "the counting test facility at borexino demonstrated that the background can be suppressed down to an extremely low level @xcite , but it was not possible to prove that it can be suppressed to the required level because the background was so low that it could not be studied ! even if the required level is achieved with the full - scale detector , understanding the energy spectrum of the background would require a challenging calibration procedure .",
    "the validity of the second assumption , of course , depends on the level of the background .",
    "it would be extremely valuable if kamland could also achieve the radio - purity planned for borexino , so that it can also study the recoil electron energy spectrum from the @xmath12be solar neutrinos , but with a larger fiducial volume . for comparison , the same plots as figs .",
    "[ fit](a ) and [ deltaa](a ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fit](b ) and [ deltaa](b ) , for two years of kamland running .",
    "we assume the bp95 estimate of 466 kamland events per day for a 1  kt fiducial volume .",
    "the difference in the recoil electron kinetic energy spectra between incident @xmath2 and @xmath38 is more prominent for @xmath11b neutrinos than for lower energy neutrinos such as the @xmath12be neutrinos ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "the main complication with the @xmath11b neutrinos is that , unlike the @xmath12be neutrinos , they have a continuous spectrum .",
    "the super - kamiokande experiment has measured the recoil electron energy spectrum from @xmath69-@xmath1 elastic scattering @xcite , which is a convolution of the neutrino energy spectrum and the @xmath20 distribution discussed in section  [ sec : spectrum ] .",
    "if the spectrum is not consistent with expectations , it indicates either that ( 1 ) the neutrino energy spectrum is not the expected one , possibly due to unknown nuclear - physics uncertainties in the @xmath11b beta spectrum ( see , however , @xcite ) , ( 2 ) the neutrino energy spectrum is distorted due to an energy dependent neutrino oscillation , ( 3 ) there is some fraction of @xmath3 in the flux , which yields a different @xmath20 distribution , or ( 4 ) a combination of them .",
    "the aim of this letter is to identify the possibility ( 3 ) .",
    "the identification of ( 3 ) is , in principle , possible .",
    "if one measures both the electron recoil energy _ and",
    "_ the recoil angle ( which is an observable because we know the direction of the sun at the time of the event in a real - time experiment ) it is easy to solve the kinematics and calculate both the incident neutrino energy @xmath70 and @xmath20",
    ". then one can select events with some specific value of @xmath70 and study the @xmath20 distribution .",
    "this program , unfortunately , can not be done at super - kamiokande .",
    "the main reason is that the recoil angle distribution to too forward - peaked , @xmath71 from eq .",
    "[ angle ] , while the angular resolution is 25@xmath72 to 35@xmath72 in the relevant energy range @xcite .",
    "the strong forward peak happens because of the high energy threshold for the recoil electron .",
    "large time projection chamber ( tpc ) experiments , such as icarus @xcite or hellaz @xcite might have enough angular and recoil energy resolution to attempt such a program ; indeed , hellaz quotes a 35mrad ( @xmath73 ) angular resolution and a @xmath74 @xmath75 resolution , which is enough for our purposes . however , their statistics is very limited ( @xmath76 events per day ) and a positive result would require too long a running time .",
    "sno studies the recoil electron energy from the charged current reaction @xmath77 , where the energy of the electron is approximately @xmath78 , where @xmath79  mev is the deuteron binding energy , when the kinetic energy of the recoil protons is neglected .",
    "the measurement of this recoil electron energy spectrum does not reflect the @xmath20 distribution discussed in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , but rather the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "this is , of course , a very valuable information in order to study the distortion of the neutrino energy spectrum due to oscillations .",
    "this is , however , not the effect we wished to study in this letter .    in principle",
    ", one can also try to deconvolute the recoil electron energy spectrum at super - kamiokande using the measured neutrino energy spectrum from sno and then determine the presence of a @xmath38 component in the @xmath7b flux via the methods presented in the previous sections . as a matter of fact",
    ", the sno experiment itself could also use the elastic scattering part of its signal to do this analysis . in principle",
    ", sno could establish active neutrino oscillations even without its neutron capture capabilities .",
    "this would , however , require a large elastic scattering sample and hence a very long running time .",
    "it seems promising to try to establish neutrino oscillations by analyzing the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum in the case of @xmath4be neutrinos .",
    "in particular we have shown that , in the case of negligible background , two years of borexino running should be enough to determine the presence of a @xmath3 component in the solar neutrino flux model - independently if @xmath80 . under the same conditions , kamland is capable of obtaining even more significant results .",
    "we emphasize that this effect is unrelated to the distortion of the incident _ neutrino _ energy spectrum , which has been thoroughly discussed in the literature .",
    "it is certainly not clear that the background will be negligible .",
    "unfortunately we can not simulate its effects clearly .",
    "instead , we chose to define two different methods of establishing active neutrino oscillations .",
    "we believe that the background will behave differently under the two methods , and therefore be more readily extracted .",
    "another crucial issue is , of course , the energy calibration .",
    "it is clear that a more thorough analysis can only be performed by detailed simulations of the detectors in questions ( and by the experiments themselves ! ) , which is beyond the scope of our letter .    finally , the situation with the @xmath7b neutrinos is much less clear , in part due to their continuous energy spectrum .",
    "it is hard to disentangle distortions in the neutrino energy spectrum , possibly due to oscillations , from changes in the recoil electron energy spectrum due to a @xmath3 component in the solar flux .",
    "the tpc appears to be the right technology for this purpose , even though the currently proposed tpc - based experiments , icarus and hellaz , will not have enough statistics .",
