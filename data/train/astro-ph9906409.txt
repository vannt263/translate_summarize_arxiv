    "on 1999 may 10.36743 ut the batse detectors on board cgro , and the gamma  ray burst monitor ( grbm ) and the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) on board the italian  dutch satellite _",
    "beppo_sax detected a gamma ray burst , grb990510 , with a fluence of 2.5@xmath4 erg @xmath5 above 20 kev ( kippen 1999 ; amati et al . 1999 ; dadina et al .",
    "the first optical follow  up observations began only @xmath63.5 hours after the @xmath7ray event and revealed a relatively bright optical transient ( @xmath0=@xmath8 , axelrod , mould & schmidt 1999 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "1999a ) at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( equinox 2000 ; hjorth et al .",
    "when compared to previously studied afterglows , the ot  showed initially a fairly slow flux decay ( @xmath11 ; galama et al .",
    "1999 ) , that steepened after one day ( @xmath12 ; stanek et al .",
    "1999a ) and further steepened after 4 days ( @xmath13 ; pietrzyski & udalski 1999 ; bloom et al . 1999 ) and 5 days ( @xmath14 ; marconi et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "such a progressive and smooth steepening had not been observed before .",
    "vreeswijk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using the vlt , detected red  shifted absorption lines in the ot  spectrum corresponding to a redshift lower limit of @xmath15 .",
    "in this letter we report on deep observations of the ot  performed with the eso vlt , ntt and 3.6 m telescopes . these observations allowed to extend the coverage of the ot  light curve up to @xmath610 days from the burst onset and to search for an underlying host galaxy .",
    "the observations were performed with the 8 m vlt  antu telescope equipped with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 ) on may 11 ( 6.8@xmath166.8  field of view and 0.2/pixel resolution ) , the eso 3.5 m ntt equipped with the superb seeing imager  2 ( susi2 ) between may 1618 ( 5.5@xmath16 5.5  field of view and 0.16/pixel resolution ) , and the eso 3.6 m telescope with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) mounted at the f/8 cassegrain focus on may 20 ( 5.5@xmath165.5  field of view and 0.32/pixel resolution ) .",
    "we performed photometry in the bessel@xmath0  and gunn@xmath1  filters .",
    "the data were reduced using standard _ eso  midas _ and _ iraf _ procedures for bias subtraction and flat  field correction .",
    "photometry for each stellar object in the image was derived both with the daophotii and the romafot midas  packages ( stetson 1987 ; buonanno & iannicola 1989 ) .",
    "point  like source @xmath0 magnitudes were derived by comparison with nearby stars , assuming @xmath17 for the star at @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) , while the @xmath1 magnitudes were calibrated observing a number of landolt photometric standards during the observational night ( landolt 1992 ) . in fig . 1 the field around the position of the ot  as observed by the vlt  fors1   ( may 11 ; left panel ) and ntt ",
    "susi2  ( may 18 ; right panel ) telescopes is shown .",
    "table  1 reports the results of the photometry for each of the pointings .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,^ , < \" , ]      + @xmath20 @xmath21 stands for degree of freedom .",
    "+ note  uncertainties refer to 1 @xmath22 confidence level .",
    "fig.2 shows the @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 relative flux light curves ( obtained from m@xmath23=2.5logf@xmath23 ) fitted with the model in eq .  1 keeping fixed @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 to the best values obtained for the @xmath0 band and leaving free to vary only the normalisation ( solid lines ) .",
    "a @xmath27 of 95 for 105 degree of freedom ( @xmath21 ) corresponding to a @xmath28 of 0.9 was obtained .",
    "note that in this case , given the larger number of data points in the @xmath0 filter , the simultaneous fit in the @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands is biased towards the @xmath0band light curve .",
    "the derived fitting parameters are nearly filter  independent , within the statistical uncertainties , suggesting a similar temporal evolution of the emission in the @xmath29 bands where only the normalisation @xmath30 varies ; this was already noted by bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and marconi et al . ( 1999a ) .    to include the possibility of an underlying galaxy we added to the model described in eq .  1 a fifth free parameter ( i.e. a constant ) corresponding to the host galaxy flux .",
    "galaxy color indices strongly depend on the morphology and distance of the host and were adopted from buzzoni ( 1995 , 1999 and references therein ) which take into account the effects of stellar evolution within the galaxy .",
    "we consider a set of color index values corresponding to @xmath31 and to three different morphologies : elliptical ( @xmath2@xmath0=2.4 ; @xmath0@xmath1=2.1 ) , spiral ( sb ; @xmath2@xmath0=0.32 ; @xmath0@xmath1=1.02 ) and irregular ( @xmath2@xmath0=0.15 ; @xmath0@xmath1=0.55 ) .",
    "moreover we corrected the set of data for absorption in the direction of grb990510  ( @xmath320.20 ; stanek et al .",
    "1999b ) which corresponds to an @xmath33 0.15 .",
    "dashed lines in fig.2 show the fit obtained by using the colors of an elliptical host galaxy of magnitude @xmath34 .",
    "we first fitted the light curves as before without the deepest points ( one in the @xmath2 , three in the @xmath0  and one in the @xmath1 band ) , then we added the deep data of this paper , keeping fixed @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and leaving the normalisation and the host galaxy flux parameters free to vary . in all cases we obtained a @xmath28 in the 0.91.1 range .",
    "as expected , the unchanged value of the reduced @xmath27 testifies that the constant parameter does not significantly improve the fit . in the case of an elliptical host",
    "the lower limit on the galaxy magnitude is strongly driven by the ot  upper limit in the @xmath1band ; any ( elliptical ) object brighter than @xmath34 would produce a levelling off of the ot  @xmath1band light curve that is not observed . the spiral and irregular host galaxy cases are consistent with the @xmath1band data , while the lower limit is driven by the vlt deep observation in the @xmath2band ( beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ) ; any object brighter than @xmath34 must be brighter than observed in the @xmath2  band .",
    "if the host galaxy is farther than @xmath31 , lower magnitudes are to be expected , while color indeces ( which are differential quantities ) remain nearly constant ( at least up to @xmath35 ) .",
    "we reported on the deep optical observations of the grb990510  ot .",
    "we are able to follow the ot  in the @xmath0  band down to 23.7 and derive an upper limit in the @xmath1  band ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we propose a functional form for the fitting of the multi - band optical light curve ( see also s99 ; bloom et al . 1999 ) and derive strong upper limits on the magnitude of galaxy hosting the grb . in particular , our photometric data exclude an elliptical host galaxy brighter than @xmath0=26.6 .",
    "further observations are needed in order to look for a faint r@xmath3727 galaxy host .",
