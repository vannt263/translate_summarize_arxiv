    "the tidal debris and companion galaxies that surround m31 are pieces of a puzzle that  when all the bits of information are assembled  should form a coherent picture of the evolution of the galaxy .",

    "the m31 disk also has a significantly larger spatial extent than the galactic disk ( hammer et al .",
    "2007 ) , as expected if the m31 disk has accreted material and been ` spun up ' .",
    "an investigation of the central few kpc of the m31 disk is of interest as it might be an area of past and/or present star - forming activity given that large - scale interactions can channel gas into the inner regions of galaxies .",

    "the goal of this exercise is not to characterize features such as bars or asymmetries in the disk that have spatial scales approaching a disk scale length ; rather , the search focuses on structures with characteristic sizes @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the 2mass images trace the light profile of m31 out to 30 arcmin ( r@xmath10 kpc ) , and so the coverage is restricted to the inner disk of the galaxy .      the photometric properties of stars in a single @xmath11 arcmin@xmath12 cfht wircam ( puget et al . 2004 ) field , which samples the major axis to the north east of the galaxy center , were examined to characterize an object that was discovered in the 2mass images .",

    "we refer to this feature as the ne clump .    while the surface brightness of the ne clump is @xmath18 mag arcsec@xmath19 fainter than the surrounding disk , it is still a significant structure , with integrated brightnesses @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for comparison ,",

    ", statistical corrections for disk contamination are based on number counts in control fields that are near the ne clump , and the locations of these fields are indicated in the upper right hand panel of figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath41 luminosity functions ( lfs ) of objects with @xmath5 colors between 0.6 and 1.8 were constructed for the ne clump and the control fields . the control field lfs were combined and scaled to match the disk surface brightness near the ne clump using the isophotal measurements described in section 3.1 .",
    "these scaled counts were then subtracted from the observed ne clump lf to produce the lf shown in the middle panel of figure 3 ; the observed ( i.e. ne clump @xmath42 disk component ) lf is shown in the top panel of figure 3 .",
    "stars remain in the ne clump area after disk subtraction , indicating that the ne clump stands out as a distinct feature in star counts .",
    "given that ( 1 ) the mean surface brightness of the ne clump is over a magnitude arcsec@xmath19 lower than the surrounding disk (  3.1 ) and ( 2 ) disk subtraction removes roughly one half of the stars , then it appears that the ne clump contains a higher fraction of bright agb stars per unit near - infrared surface brightness than the surrounding disk .",
    "this could indicate a higher specific star formation rate ( sfr ) in the ne clump when compared with the disk during the past few hundred myr , in agreement with the difference in the color distributions of the ne clump and the disk ( see below ) .",

    "( 1993 ) mass function was adopted .",

    "the raw color distribution ( i.e. with no correction for disk contamination ) is shown in the top panel , while the distribution after subtracting the contribution from the control fields is shown in the lower panel .",
    "monte carlo simulations , in which the number counts in each color bin of the ne clump and control fields were perturbed by the uncertainties predicted from counting statistics , were run to determine the significance of the differences between the color distribution of the ne clump and the control fields .",
    "these simulations indicate that the peak of the @xmath5 distribution in the ne clump is bluer than that in the control fields at more than the 2@xmath44 significance level .",
    "the color distribution of agb stars in the ne clump is thus skewed to bluer colors than the disk contribution , indicating that the stellar mixture in the ne clump differs from that in the surrounding disk .",
    "the required differences in stellar content can be estimated from the marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) models , which indicate that a change of 0.05 magnitudes in the peak of the j ",

    "a concentration of agb stars has been identified on the major axis of m31 3.5 kpc to the north and east of the galaxy center .",
    "the ` ne clump ' is evident in both integrated near - infrared light and star counts .",
    "the ne clump has probably eluded detection to date because much of the previous work on m31 has focused on either the central areas of the bulge or the outermost regions of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , structures of this nature are difficult to detect at visible wavelengths given their low surface brightness and sub - structure introduced by blue stars and dust . however , at near - infrared wavelengths it is possible to probe the stellar content to comparatively small radii due to ( 1 ) the reduced levels of dust extinction , and ( 2 ) the diminished effects of line blanketing at these wavelengths , which results in greater contrast between luminous red giant branch stars and the underlying body of bluer stars .    the ne clump is dominated by stars with ages @xmath4 myr , and is not a simple stellar system .",
    "indeed , comparisons with a model lf suggest that the sfr changed 140 myr and 220 myr in the past . the @xmath5 color distribution of agb stars in the ne clump is skewed to blue colors when compared with the distribution of the surrounding disk , suggesting that stars in the ne clump have a lower metallicity and/or a younger mean age than those in the surrounding m31 disk .",
    "\\1 ) the ne clump is a heretofore unidentified satellite of m31 . the sersic index and central surface brightness of the ne clump fall within the range defined by nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the effective radius of the ne clump is larger than expected for a dwarf galaxy .",
    "depending on the distance above / below the m31 disk plane , the size and structure of the ne clump may be affected by tidal forces .",
    "if the ne clump is a dwarf galaxy that contains stars with a wide range of ages then m / l@xmath46 , and its stellar mass will be @xmath47 m@xmath48 .",
    "given that the mass of m31 within 5 kpc of the nucleus is @xmath49 m@xmath48 ( e.g. carignan et al .",
    "2006 ) , then the tidal radius of the ne clump is @xmath50 parcsecs ( @xmath51 arcsec ) if it is in the m31 disk plane .",
    "the presence of dark matter in the ne clump would push the tidal radius to higher values . finally , while the colors of agb stars in the ne clump and its comparatively blue integrated @xmath5 color are consistent with a stellar mixture that differs from that of the m31 disk , it is not clear if this is due to differences in metallicity , age , or both .",
    "a difference in metallicity would be expected if the ne clump is a dwarf galaxy .",
    "\\2 ) the ne clump is a fossil star - forming region in the m31 disk .",
    "the ne clump has experienced star formation for an extended period of time , and there is evidence of changes in the sfr during the past @xmath52 myr ago .",
    "there are other areas of recent star formation in the disk of m31 that have been active for a similar extended period of time ( e.g. davidge et al . 2012 ) , and williams ( 2003 ) and davidge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) conclude that the area @xmath53 kpc to the north east of the center of m31 had elevated levels of star formation during the past few hundred myr .",
    "one possible trigger for star formation over kpc spatial scales is an interaction with a companion .",
    "in fact , the change in sfr in the ne clump 220 myr ago coincides with the timing of the passage of a satellite through the inner disk of m31 proposed by block et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as well as with the formation of the giant stellar stream ( gss ) , which models suggest may have formed between 0.25 gyr ( font et al .",
    "2006 ) and 0.65 gyr ( fardal et al . 2007 ) in the past .",
    "in contrast , hammer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggest that the gss formed much earlier , due to an interaction between m31 and another large galaxy .",
    "the ne clump is near the end of the bar identified by beaton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and the compression of gas as the bar passes through the disk may induce star formation",
    ". however , the more - or - less round morphology of the ne clump may not be consistent with such as trigger .",
    "dobbs & pringle ( 2010 ) investigate the distribution of stars in a barred spiral galaxy , and stars in their models that formed in the bar @xmath54 myr in the past are smeared azimuthally , with additional radial blurring .",
    "there are two observational predictions that could be tested to probe the nature of the ne clump .",
    "if it is a dwarf galaxy then ( 1 ) spectroscopic studies should find that a substantial fraction of stars in this field are chemically distinct from those of the disk , and ( 2 ) deep high angular resolution imaging should reveal an rgb sequence that is skewed to bluer colors than in the surrounding disk .",
    "spectroscopic studies may also find that any stars that are chemically distinct from those in the disk also have non - disk kinematics , although this depends on the orbit of the ne clump .",
    "if it is found to be a dwarf galaxy then the ne clump is a new consideration when interpreting structures in the m31 system .",
    "when its location and properties with respect to the m31 disk are established then it may prove to be the source of at least some of the tidal features that are seen today .",
