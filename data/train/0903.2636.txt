    "in addition , @xcite suggested that the bipolarity in the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs oph may result from an equatorial enhancement in its cool giant . if the cool giant in symbiotic star has high mass - loss rate and an aspherical stellar wind , the contribution of symbiotic channel to total sne ia may be significantly enhanced .    in this work , assuming an aspherical stellar wind with equatorial disk around the symbiotic giant , we show an alternative symbiotic channel to sne ia . in @xmath7 2",

    "however , the majority ( @xmath8 ) of observed planetary nebulae are found to have aspherical morphologies @xcite .",
    "this property can be explained by two models : ( i)the generalized wind - blown bubble in which a fast tenuous wind is blown into a previously ejected slow wind ( see a review by @xcite ) ; ( ii)the interaction of the slow wind blown by an agb star with a collimated fast wind blown by its companion @xcite . in two models ,",
    "the slow wind is aspherically distributed and the densest in the equatorial plane .",
    "the aspherical wind with an equatorial disk may result from the stellar rotation @xcite or a simple dipole magnetic field @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that an anisotropic wind from agb star can be caused by combining rotation effects with the existence of an inflated atmosphere formed by the stellar pulsation .",
    "therefore , the fast rotation and strong magnetic field are crucial physical conditions for an equatorial disk .",
    "an isolated rg usually has a low rotational velocity so that its effect can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , using a traditional method applied for the solar magnetic field , @xcite estimated the magnetic activity of agb stars , and found that the level of activity expected from single agb stars is too low to explain the aspherical wind . however , the situations in symbiotic stars are different .",
    "@xcite showed that the cool companions in symbiotic systems are likely to rotate much faster than isolated rgs due to accretion , tidal interaction and back - flowing material . according to measurements of the projected rotational velocities of the cool giants 9 symbiotic stars and 28 field giants",

    "in general , the equatorial disk has a lower outflow velocity than the spherical wind @xcite , and the typical wind velocity of field giant is between @xmath3 5 and 30 km s@xmath2 . due to the existence of an extended zone above the agb star@xcite",

    "the standard brightness during the first 20 days after explosion and the suddenness of the brightness around 22 days implied that the original sn explosion expanded into a region with little cs material , and then encountered a region with significant cs material @xcite .",
    "investigating the high - resolution optical spectroscopy at 256 d and hk - band infrared photometry at + 278 and + 380 d , @xcite suggested that there is a dense and slow - moving ( @xmath3 100 km s@xmath2 ) outflow , and a dusty cs material in sn 2002ic . in our model ,",
    "a cavity with little cs material around the accreting wd results from the wd s accretion , the dense and slow - moving outflow originates from the dense equatorial disk which have collided with the ejecta from sn explosion , and dust in cs material is formed in the dense equatorial disk .",
    "the radius of the cavity is roughly equal to the roche lobe radius of the accreting wd , @xmath132 .",
    "the region out of the cavity has large amount of cs material which mainly originates from the equatorial disk . due to orbital movement , the cs material out of the cavity has complicated structure .",
    "however , the most dense region lies on the equatorial disk around the secondary .",
    "the region where the ejecta from sn 2002ic firstly encountered the significant cs material is between @xmath132 and binary separation .",
    "[ fig : sep02 ] shows the distributions of @xmath132 and the binary separation of the progenitors of sn 2002ic prior to their explosion as a sn ia .",
    "the observationally estimated region is @xmath133 cm away from the explosion .",
    "obviously , the majority of binary separations in our work are shorter than @xmath134 cm .",
    "a few binary separations in case 2 in which the equatorial disk has a low outflow velocity are longer than @xmath134 cm . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : asphe ] , we do not consider an extended zone above the agb star , which results in the underestimate for contribution of the symbiotic stars with long orbital periods to sn ia .",

    "ia observationally estimated in the galaxy , the birthrates of sne ia like sn 2002ic in this work are not more than 1% of the total birthrates of sne ia .",
    "sn 2002ic is very rare event in the galaxy .",
    "c      @xcite detected the cs material in sn 2006x from variable na i d ( however , see @xcite ) .",
    "they found relatively low expansion velocities ( mean velocity is about @xmath137 ) , and estimated that the absorbing dust is a few @xmath138 cm from the sn .",
    "a possible interpretation given by @xcite is that the high - velocity ejecta of nova bursts in the progenitors are , by sweeping up the stellar wind of the donor star , slowed down to relatively low expansion velocities . according to the resolved light echo , @xcite fond that the illuminated dust is @xmath327170 pc .",
    "the dust surrounding sn 2006x has multiple shells @xcite , and stems from the progenitor .",
    "in addition , the dust surrounding sn 2006x is quite different from that observed in the galaxy , and has a much smaller grain size than that of typical interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , there is apparent presence of dust in the cs environment in the 2006 outburst of recurrent nova rs oph @xcite . @xcite and @xcite reported that the dust appears to be present in the intervals of outbursts and is not created during the outburst event .",
    "this means that there is a dense region of the wind from the rg so that the dust can be formed @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , the densest parts of the red - giant wind lie in the equatorial regions along the plane of the binary orbit .",
    "the dust in recurrent nova rs oph originates possibly from the dense equatorial disk around the rg .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the progenitor of sn 2006x is very similar with recurrent nova rs oph .",
    "we assume that the candidates for the progenitor of sn 2006x satisfy with following two conditions : ( i ) there is a dense equatorial disk around rg , which can produce dust ; ( ii ) the progenitor of sn 2006x has undergone a series of weak thermonuclear outbursts presented by the filled triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : mprg ] prior to explosion as sn ia .",
    "the high - velocity ejecta from every thermonuclear outburst blow off the parts of the stellar wind including the dust produced by dense equatorial disk . during this process ,",
    "the high - velocity ejecta are slowed down , and the dust can be irradiated so that the grain size becomes small .",
    "a more detailed model for sn 2006x is in preparation .",
    "according to the above conditions , we select the possible progenitors of sn 2006x from our sample which are showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mp06 ]",
    ". the birthrates of sne ia like sn 2006x in the galaxy from cases 1 to 8 are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively",
    ". therefore , sne ia like sn 2006x are very rare events . fig .",
    "[ fig : sin06 ] displays the evolution of birthrates of sne ia like sn 2006x for a single star burst .",
    "by a toy model in which the cool giant in symbiotic star has an aspherical stellar wind with an equatorial disk , we investigate the production of sne ia via symbiotic channel .",
    "we estimate that the galactic birthrate of sne ia via symbiotic channel is between @xmath95 ( case 2 ) and @xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( case 6 ) , the delay time of sne ia has wide range from @xmath3 0.07 to 5 gyr .",
    "the results are greatly affected by the outflow velocity and mass - loss rate of the equatorial disk .",
    "the progenitor of sn 2002ic may be a wd+rg in which there is a dense equatorial disk around the rg .",
    "the cs environment of sn 2002ic may mainly originate from the dense equatorial disk . in the progenitor of sn 2006x ,",
    "the co wd has undergone a series of mildly unstable hydrogen - shell burning , and the dust in the cs environment may originate from a dense equatorial disk around the rg and is swept out by the ejecta of every thermonuclear outburst .",
