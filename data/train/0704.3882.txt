    "the essential features of confinement , of the deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature and of the deconfined phase in qcd can be studied without loss of relevant dynamics in the regime of infinitely massive quarks or , equivalently , in the su(3 ) _ pure _ gauge theory .",
    "the ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) pure gauge theory at finite temperature undergoes a confinement / deconfinement phase transition associated with the breaking of the center of the gauge group , z(3 )  @xcite .",
    "this transition is _ weakly _ first order  @xcite and the order parameter is the polyakov loop  @xcite .    in general , the deconfinement transition in the @xmath2-dimensional su(n )",
    "pure gauge theory at finite temperature can be put in relation with the order / disorder  @xcite phase transition of the @xmath0-dimensional z(n ) spin model through the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite . according to this conjecture ,",
    "when the transition is _ second order _ the gauge theory and the spin model belong to the same universality class and therefore share critical indices , amplitude ratios and correlation functions at criticality .",
    "there are so many numerical evidences in favor of this conjecture  see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and , for a review , ref .",
    "@xcite  that there is no residual doubt about its validity .    in the case of",
    "_ first order _ phase transitions , as for the ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) pure gauge theory , the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture is not applicable in strict sense , since the correlation length keeps finite at the transition point and a universal behavior , independent of the details of the microscopic interactions , can not be established .",
    "therefore there are no _ a priori _ reasons why the critical dynamics of ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) and of its would - be counterpart spin model , 3@xmath0 z(3 ) or 3-state potts model  @xcite , should look similar .",
    "it turns out , however , that for both these theories the phase transition is _ weakly _ first order , which means that the correlation length at the transition point , although finite , becomes much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "this leads to the expectation that the two theories may have some long distance aspects in common and that some specific issues of su(3 ) in the transition region can be studied taking the 3@xmath0 3-state potts model as an effective model .",
    "since there are no critical indices to compare , a test of this possibility could be based on the comparison of the spectrum of massive excitations of the 3@xmath0 3-state potts model in the broken phase near the transition at zero magnetic field with the spectrum of the inverse decay lengths of polyakov loop correlators in the ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) gauge theory in the deconfined phase near the transition .",
    "if universality would apply in strict sense , these spectra should exhibit the same pattern , as suggested by several numerical determinations in the 3@xmath0 ising class  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we determine the low - lying masses of the spectrum of the ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) pure gauge theory at finite temperature in the deconfined phase near the transition in two different sectors of parity and orbital angular momentum , 0@xmath3 and 2@xmath3 , and compare their ratio with that of the corresponding massive excitations in the phase of broken z(3 ) symmetry of the 3@xmath0 3-state potts model , determined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , we extend our numerical analysis to temperatures far away from the transition temperature @xmath4 in order to look for possible `` scaling '' of the fundamental masses with temperature .",
    "moreover , we consider also the screening masses resulting from correlators of the real parts and of the imaginary parts of the polyakov loop .",
    "these determinations can represent useful benchmarks for effective models of the high - temperature phase of su(3 ) , such as those based on mean - field theories of the polyakov loop , suggested by r.  pisarski  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : masses ] we describe the methods used to extract the screening masses through polyakov loop correlators in ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) ; in section  [ results ] we present our numerical results and compare them with expectations from the 3@xmath0 3-state potts model and from polyakov loop effective models ; in the last section we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we define the general procedure for extracting screening masses in ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) at finite temperature from correlators of the polyakov loop , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of lattice sizes in the temporal direction and @xmath7 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the point - point connected correlation function is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the indices of sites and @xmath11 is the distance between them .",
    "the large-@xmath11 behavior of the point - point connected correlation function is determined by the correlation length of the theory , @xmath12 , or , equivalently , by its inverse , the fundamental mass . in order to extract the fundamental mass it is convenient to define the wall - wall connected correlation function , since numerical data in this case can be directly compared with exponentials in @xmath11 , without any power prefactor .",
    "the 0@xmath3-channel connected wall - wall correlator in the @xmath13-direction is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the polyakov loop averaged over the @xmath16-plane at a given @xmath13 . here and in the following , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the number of lattice sites in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "the wall average implies the projection at zero momentum in the @xmath16-plane .    the correlation function  ( [ corr0 ] ) takes contribution from all the screening masses in the 0@xmath3 channel .",
    "in fact , the general large distance behavior for the function @xmath19 , in an infinite lattice , is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fundamental mass , while @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ... are higher masses with the same angular momentum and parity ( 0@xmath3 ) quantum numbers of the fundamental mass . on a periodic lattice",

    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are single exponentials of the effective masses in the given channel . the variational method is usually adopted to determine massive excitations above the fundamental one in the given channel . in our case , however , it turned out that this method improved the determination of the fundamental mass in the 2@xmath3-channel , but did not lead to determine higher excitations .",

    "<S> we determine from polyakov loop correlators the screening masses in the deconfined phase of the ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the transition , for two different channels of angular momentum and parity . </S>",
    "<S> their ratio is compared with that of the massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3@xmath0 3-state potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field . </S>",
