    "the reconstruction of the statistical properties of a network when only limited information is available represents one of the outstanding and unsolved problems in the field of complex networks @xcite .",
    "a first example is the case of financial networks , for which systemic risk estimation is based on the inter - dependencies among institutions @xcite  yet , due to confidentiality issues , the information that regulators are able to collect on mutual exposures is very limited @xcite .",
    "other examples include social networks , for which information may be unavailable because of privacy problems or simply for the impossibility to sample the whole system .",
    "network reconstruction has been typically pursued through maximum entropy ( me ) algorithms @xcite , which obtain link weights via a maximum homogeneity principle ; however , the strong limitation of these algorithms resides in the assumption that the network is fully connected ( for this reason they are known as `` dense reconstruction methods '' ) , while real networks show a largely heterogeneous connectivity distribution . more refined methods like `` sparse reconstruction '' algorithms @xcite allow to obtain a network with arbitrary heterogeneity , but still can not set an appropriate value for such heterogeneity . recently ,",
    "a novel _ bootstrapping _ ( bs ) method @xcite has been proposed in order to overcome these problems .",
    "the bs method uses the limited information on the system to generate an ensemble of networks according to the _ exponential random graph _ ( erg ) model @xcite  where , however , the lagrange multipliers that define it are replaced by _",
    "fitnesses _ , _ i.e. _ , known intrinsic node - specific properties related to the network topology @xcite . the estimation of the network topological properties is then carried out within the erg - induced ensemble .",
    "the method builds on previous results @xcite which showed that , in the particular case of the world trade web ( see below ) , the knowledge of a non - topological property ( the gross domestic product ) , if coupled to that of the total number of links , allows to infer the topological properties of the network with great accuracy .",
    "this procedure can be restated within a maximum - likelihood framework @xcite .",
    "the bs method uses these preliminary observations to provide a reconstruction procedure valid in the case when the the degree sequence of the network ( _ i.e. _ , the number of connections for each node ) is known only partially .    while past works @xcite mainly dealt with using the limited information available on the network to estimate specific high - order properties such as systemic risk , in the present paper we employ the bs method to reconstruct the fundamental properties that are commonly used to describe a network : density of links , assortativity , clustering ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : top_prop ] ) . by focusing on these previously untested properties ,",
    "we are able to enlarge the basket of quantities that are properly estimated by the bs approach . to validate our method we study how its accuracy depends upon the size of the subset of nodes for which the information is available",
    "; our case - study includes synthetic networks generated through a _ fitness _ model @xcite as well as real instances of networked systems : 1 ) the world trade web ( wtw ) , @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the network whose nodes are the countries and links represent trade volumes among them , and 2 ) the network of interbank loans of the e - mid ( e - mid ) interbank money market @xcite .",
    "we start by briefly describing the erg model and the fitness model , on which the bs method builds .",
    "the erg model is one of the most common network generation framework @xcite , which consists in defining an ensemble @xmath0 of networks which is maximally random , except for the ensemble average of a set of network properties @xmath1constrained to some specific values @xmath2 . the probability distribution over @xmath0",
    "can then be defined via a set of control parameters @xmath3 , namely the set of lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints @xmath4 .",
    "a particular yet widely used case of the erg model is known as the configuration model ( cm ) @xcite , which is obtained by specifying the mean degree sequence @xmath5 of the network . in this case , each node @xmath6 is identified by the lagrange multiplier @xmath7 associated to its degree @xmath8 . by defining @xmath9 @xmath10 , the ensemble probability that any two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath11 are connected reads @xcite : @xmath12 so that @xmath13 quantifies the ability of node @xmath6 to create links with other nodes ( induced by its degree @xmath8 ) @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the _ fitness _ model @xcite assumes the network topology to be determined by an intrinsic non - topological property ( known as _ fitness _ ) associated with each node of the network , and has successfully been used in the past to model several empirical economical networks @xcite .    the bs method @xcite combines these two network generation models , working as follows .",
    "we start from incomplete information about the topology of a given network @xmath14 ( consisting of @xmath15 nodes ) : we assume to know the degree sequence @xmath16 of only a subset @xmath17 of the nodes ( with @xmath18 ) and an intrinsic , non - topological property @xmath19 for all the nodes  that will be our fitness ( see below ) . using this information",
    ", we want to find the most probable estimate of the value @xmath20 of a topological property @xmath21 computed on the network @xmath14 , compatible with the aforementioned constraints .",
    "the method builds on two important assumptions :    1 .   the network @xmath14 is interpreted as drawn from an erg - induced ensemble @xmath0",
    "we then expect the quantity @xmath22 to mostly vary within the range @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively average and standard deviation of property @xmath21 estimated over the ensemble @xmath0 .",
    "the non - topological fitnesses @xmath26 are assumed to be proportional the degree - induced exponential lagrange multipliers @xmath27 through a universal ( unknown ) parameter @xmath28 : ) accurately describes the wtw topology when @xmath29 @xcite . in any case , this second assumption ( or any other relation @xmath30 ) can be appropriately tested on the subset @xmath17 of nodes for which the degree is known . ]",
    "@xmath31 @xmath10 .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking ] ) becomes : @xmath32    thanks to these two assumptions we can turn the problem of evaluating @xmath20 into the one of choosing the optimal erg ensemble @xmath0 compatible with the constraints on @xmath14 , which is the most appropriate to extract the real network @xmath14 from  given that we know only partial information . once @xmath0 is determined ( by the set @xmath27 and thus by the set @xmath26 ) , we can use the average @xmath24 as a good estimation for @xmath20 and @xmath25 as the typical statistical error .",
    "now , since we know the rescaled fitness values @xmath26 , the problem becomes equivalent to that of finding the most likely value of @xmath28 that defines the ensemble @xmath0 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking z ] ) .    an estimation for the value of @xmath28 can be found using the incomplete degree sequence through the following relation @xcite : @xmath33 in which the first equality comes from the definition of the erg model , and the second one is the application of the maximum - likelihood argument @xcite  the whole equation being restricted only to the nodes belonging to the subset @xmath17 . since @xmath34 contains the unknown @xmath28 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking z ] ) , and @xmath26 and @xmath35 are known , eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimatez ] ) defines an algebraic equation in @xmath28 , whose solution can be used to estimate the degree - induced lagrange multipliers @xmath36 @xmath10 of the erg ensemble @xmath37 , and at the end to obtain an estimation of @xmath20 .",
    "summing up , the bs algorithm consists in the following steps . given a network @xmath14 , the knowledge of some non - topological property @xmath26 for all the nodes and the knowledge of the degrees of a subset @xmath17 of nodes :    *",
    "compute the sum of the degrees of the nodes in @xmath17 ( @xmath35 ) and use it together with @xmath36 @xmath10 to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimatez ] ) and to obtain the corresponding value of @xmath28 ; * using the estimated @xmath28 and the knowledge of @xmath26 , generate the ensemble @xmath37 by placing a link between each pair of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath11 with probability @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking z ] ) ; * compute the estimate of @xmath20 as @xmath39 , either analytically or numerically .",
    "as stated in the introduction , in testing the bs method we will focus on the topological properties ( each playing the role of @xmath21 in the previous discussion ) which are commonly regarded as the most significant for describing a network . to define these properties , we use the formalism of the adjacency matrix  where @xmath40 if nodes @xmath6 and @xmath11 are connected , and @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "we consider :    * link density ( or connectance ) : @xmath42 which is the ratio between the actual number of links in the network and the maximal one compatible with the number of nodes @xmath15 ; * mean average nearest - neighbors degree : @xmath43 _ i.e. _ , the arithmetic mean of the degrees of the neighbors of each node , averaged over all nodes ; * the mean clustering coefficient : @xmath44 _ i.e. _ , the ratio between the number of observed links in each node neighborhood and the maximum possible number of such links , averaged over all nodes @xcite ; * average rich - club coefficient : @xmath45 with @xmath46 representing the fraction of nodes having degree equal to @xmath47 and @xmath48 the ratio between the @xmath49 edges actually connecting the @xmath50 $ ] nodes with degree higher than @xmath47 and the maximum possible number @xmath51 of such edges ( or , in other words , the density of links of the subgraph consisting of only the nodes with degree higher than @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "in order to validate our bs method we use two instances of real economic systems .",
    "the first one is the world trade web @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the network whose nodes represent the world - countries and links represent trade volumes between them : thus , @xmath52 is the total amount of the export of country @xmath6 to country @xmath11 .",
    "the second one is the interbank loan network of the so - called e - mid interbank money market @xcite . in this case , the nodes represent the banks and a link @xmath52 between banks @xmath6 and @xmath11 represents the amount of the loan from bank @xmath6 to bank @xmath11 . these datasets are particularly suited for our study , as the node fitnesses @xmath26 can be naturally identified with country gdp for the wtw and with the banks total exposures ( _ i.e. _ , the total lending ) for e - mid .",
    "thus in both cases each node fitness coincides with its total strength : @xmath53 . the binary undirected version of these networks ( that we want to reconstruct )",
    "is then built as @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "before proceeding to results , we remark that the bs method is subject to two different types of errors .",
    "the first one is due to the limited information available for calibrating the erg model : since we know only the degrees of a subset @xmath17 of nodes , we can just obtain an estimate of the best @xmath28 of the erg ensemble through eq . ( [ eq : estimatez ] ) .",
    "the second error comes from the assumption that the node fitnesses @xmath26 are proportional to the degree - induced lagrange multipliers @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig : test_fit ] shows the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the two empirical networks . indeed , there are deviations from linearity  which would correspond to a perfect realization of the fitness model .",
    "note that a better correlation is observed for the wtw : thus , we can expect the bs method to work better in this case .",
    "the quantitative estimation of the bs method effectiveness in reconstructing the topological properties of the two case - studies networks thus proceeds in two steps , as follows .",
    "vs exponential lagrange multiplier @xmath27 for wtw ( left panel ) and e - mid ( right panel).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    [ [ test - on - synthetic - networks . ] ] test on synthetic networks .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to assess the errors which are only due to the limited information available about the degree sequence , we first perform a benchmark test on _ synthetic _ networks generated through the fitness model .",
    "this means that we use the fitnesses @xmath26 ( gdps for the wtw and total loans for e - mid ) to evaluate the `` real '' @xmath28 of the erg ensemble by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimatez ] ) with all nodes included in @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _ , assuming to know the whole degree sequence ) , and then draw a network @xmath14 from @xmath37 by numerically generating it through eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking z ] ) .",
    "@xmath14 is now the network to reconstruct through the bs method ( _ i.e. _ , with partial information ) , and the value of @xmath21 is computed both on @xmath14 itself as @xmath22 , as well as on the whole ensemble @xmath37 as @xmath55 . as the expected values of the adjacency matrix elements @xmath56 in the definitions ( [ eq.d],[eq.k_nn],[eq.clu],[eq.phi ] ) . ]",
    "inferring @xmath14 then consists of the following operative steps :    * choose a value of @xmath57 ( the number of nodes for which the degree is known ) ; * build a set of @xmath58 subsets @xmath59 of @xmath60 nodes picked at random ; * for each subset @xmath61 , use the degree sequence in @xmath61 to evaluate @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimatez ] ) , and use it to build the ensemble @xmath63 ; * use the linking probabilities from eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking z ] ) to compute the value of property @xmath21 over the ensemble @xmath63 as @xmath64 ; * compute the relative root mean square error ( rrmse ) of property @xmath21 over the subsets @xmath65 : @xmath66 ^ 2}\\ ] ]    in the rrmse expression , @xmath67 denotes a reference value of property @xmath21 , which can be either @xmath22 ( the value of @xmath21 measured on @xmath14 ) , as well as @xmath55 ( the value of @xmath21 on the whole ensemble @xmath37 ) .",
    "the consequent two alternative rrmses ( which we denote as @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively ) provide different estimates of the bs method accuracy .",
    "in fact , @xmath68 tests the ability to reproduce a single outcome of the ensemble sampling , whereas , @xmath69 refers to the theoretical values of @xmath21 expected on the ensemble .",
    "note that since the ensemble @xmath37 is generated through the fitness model , by construction @xmath70 for @xmath71 ; however , @xmath68 does not necessarily tend to zero , because the generated configuration @xmath14 is a single realization of @xmath37 and thus in general @xmath72 .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the testing procedure for real networks is equivalent to the one described above , with the only difference that @xmath14 and @xmath67 are now the empirical network and the value of @xmath21 computed on such network respectively  the rrmse in this case is denoted as @xmath77 .",
    "we recall again that since the fitness model is only an approximation for real networks , in this case we expect larger errors from the bs reconstruction than those computed for the synthetic networks .",
    "[ [ results . ] ] results .",
    "+ + + + + + + +    in order to study the accuracy of the bs reconstruction , we study how the rrmse for the various topological properties we consider varies as a function of the size @xmath60 of the subset of nodes used to calibrate the erg model ( _ i.e. _ , for which information about the degrees is available ) .",
    "results are shown in fig.[fig : test_on_wtw ] for wtw and in fig .",

    "this is an indication of the goodness of the estimation provided by the bs method .",
    "as expected , the rrmse is higher for real networks than for synthetic networks , and the difference between the two respective curves gives a quantitative estimation of the error made in modeling real networks with the fitness model .",
    "the fact that such difference is higher for e - mid than for wtw is directly related to the better correlation between node fitnesses and node degrees observed in the latter case .",
    "note also that the errors for e - mid are higher than the ones for wtw also for the corresponding synthetic networks .",
    "this feature is easily explained by the higher link density of wtw ( @xmath78 ) with respect to that of e - mid ( @xmath79 ) : denser networks are easier to reconstruct because nodes have more links , and thus carry more information for the bs method to exploit ( as fluctuations are tamed out ) .",
    "in this paper we tested a novel network reconstruction ( bs ) method that allows to estimates the topological properties of a network by using only partial information about its connectivity , as well as a non - topological quantity ( interpreted as fitness ) associated to each node .",
    "this method is particularly useful to overcome the lack of topological information which often hinders the study of complex networks .",
    "we tested the method on empirical networks , as well as on synthetic networks generated through the fitness model , and studied how well it can estimate the fundamental topological properties which are widely employed to describe network patterns : connectivity , assortativity , clustering coefficient and rich - club coefficient .",
    "we found that these properties are reconstructed accurately , for instance with a tolerance usually varying from 2% to 15% ( depending on the property examined ) using only 5% of the nodes .",
    "we also found that the bs method brings to better estimates in denser networks ( where more information is available ) ; additionally , the method effectiveness strongly depends on the accuracy of the fitness model used to describe the empirical dataset . in the case of the wtw ,",
    "the fitness model is fairly accurate in describing how links are formed across countries depending on their gdp @xcite and the bs is thus efficient in reconstructing the network topological properties . in the case of",
    "e - mid , the fitness model is less accurate and so is the bs method , but the latter can still lead to useful outcomes .    while at first thought it can be surprising that a small fraction of nodes enables to estimate with high accuracy global emerging properties of the network , it is important to remark that the bs method assumes the knowledge of the fitness of all nodes and the validity of the fitness model in describing the data .",
    "therefore , a limitation of this method could arise when considering higher - order topological properties as the community structure .",
    "possibly , in these situations the method could require a larger initial information to obtain the same results .",
    "investigation of these cases is left for future research .",
    "finally note that , contrarily to past works @xcite , in this paper we focused on estimating previously untested network quantities , namely the most fundamental properties of a network .",
    "this allows us to enlarge the number of properties whose estimations are in remarkable agreement with observations .",
    "indeed , any network reconstruction method must be tested against these basic quantities before being employed for more demanding tasks that are specific for a class of networks ( such as systemic risk estimation in financial networks ) .",
    "thus , the validation of the bs method we presented here also allows us to extend its applicability to any set of dependencies among components in a complex system .",
