    "magnetic nanostructures in external magnetic fields as well as under the influence of spin - polarized currents have become interesting research fields in recent years due to fundamental novel effects that occur for geometrically confined spin structures , such as domain walls.@xcite current - induced domain wall motion has been suggested as an alternative to the use of external magnetic fields to induce switching , opening the possibility of simple device fabrication making field - generating strip lines redundant . while current - induced domain wall motion is experimentally well established,@xcite the underlying physical mechanisms are not completely understood yet and in particular the importance of the adiabatic and the non - adiabatic spin torque terms as well as domain wall transformations for high current densities are highly debated.@xcite furthermore , the influence of temperature on the effects has so far been neglected in the calculations and so the experimentally found temperature dependence of for instance the critical current densities is so far not understood.@xcite    to theoretically predict the behavior of a spin texture under current , one can numerically solve the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation and computer simulations can be performed using either a micromagnetic model or a classical atomistic spin model .",
    "spin torque effects can be taken into account by including the adiabatic and the non - adiabatic torque terms.@xcite due to the computational expense of atomistic simulations , system sizes are restricted to a nanometer range , so that micromagnetic approaches are desirable .",
    "however , conventional micromagnetic calculations for larger system sizes lack the correct description of temperature effects because of the assumption of a constant magnetization length . an alternative approach that has only recently started to be used widely to investigate realistic systems sizes including temperature effects is to employ the so - called landau - lifshitz - bloch equation.@xcite this equation forms the basis for micromagnetic calculations at elevated temperatures using a macro - spin model where longitudinal relaxation processes are taken into account @xcite but so far the llb equation has only been studied without the spin torque terms .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the llb equation of motion by adding the spin torque terms and we study domain wall motion under the influence of current and at variable temperatures .",
    "we determine the domain wall velocities and find that they exhibit a strong dependence on the temperature .",
    "furthermore , by the interplay between the adiabatic and the non - adiabatic spin torque the resulting onset of domain wall transformations ( walker breakdown ) is very sensitive to the temperature .",
    "while in the llg equation at the length of the macro - spins stays constant , for finite temperatures an equation of motion for macro - spins allowing for longitudinal relaxation was derived by garanin @xcite within mean - field approximation from the classical fokker - planck equation for atomistic spins interacting with a heat bath .",
    "the resulting `` landau - lifshitz - bloch equation '' has been shown to be able to describe linear domain walls , a domain wall type with non - constant magnetization length.@xcite furthermore , the predictions for the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times have been successfully compared with atomistic simulations @xcite as well as rapid heating experiments.@xcite therefore , we now employ this equation to study the thermodynamics as well as the excitations of macro - spins due to currents .",
    "the llb equation can be written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a to its zero temperature value normalized spin polarization and @xmath2 the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the magnetization is not assumed to be of constant length and even its equilibrium value , @xmath3 , is temperature dependent .",
    "hence , besides the usual precession and relaxation terms , the llb equation contains another term which controls longitudinal relaxation .",
    "the llb equation is valid for finite temperatures and even above the curie temperature @xmath4 though the damping parameters and effective fields are different below and above @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are dimensionless longitudinal and transverse damping parameters .",
    "for @xmath7 they are @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for @xmath10",
    "the damping parameters are equal , @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is a microscopic damping parameter which characterizes the coupling of the individual , atomistic spins to the heat bath . in the limit",
    "@xmath13 the longitudinal damping parameter @xmath5 vanishes and with @xmath14 the llb equation evolves into the usual landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation .",
    "the effective fields of the llb equation are the derivative @xmath15 of the free energy density @xmath16 .",
    "the total field is given by @xcite @xmath17    with the biaxial anisotropy field , @xmath18 which makes the @xmath19-axis the easy axis , the @xmath20-axis the intermediate axis and the @xmath21-axis the hard axis of the model .",
    "the exchange field is @xmath22 were @xmath23 is the lateral size of the discretized cells , @xmath24 is the temperature dependent exchange stiffness , and @xmath25 is the zero temperature saturation magnetization .",
    "the susceptibilities @xmath26 are defined by @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "note , that at low temperatures the perpendicular susceptibility @xmath29 is related to the temperature dependent anisotropy constant @xmath30 via @xmath31.@xcite we use functions for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 as calculated before for the spin model ( for details see @xcite ) but rescaled to reflect a ferromagnetic material with a curie temperature of and an @xmath35 of @xmath36{a / m}$ ] .",

    "in these studies the interaction between electron spins and magnetization has been treated by additional spin torque terms    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a unit vector representing the direction of the magnetization . the first contribution to the spin torque",
    "is called the adiabatic term . it can be derived from an additional term in the magnetic free energy that takes into account the coupling of the magnetization to the spins of the electrical current,@xcite representing an adiabatic transfer of angular momentum to the magnetization .",
    "in the adiabatic limit the spin polarization of the current is always oriented along the local direction of the magnetization .",
    "the second contribution is the non - adiabatic term that reflects the mistracking of the direction of the conduction electron spins with respect to the magnetization .",
    "it appears to play a role similar to the gilbert damping term .",
    "recent micromagnetic numerical investigations @xcite using a modified llg equation including these terms have given a qualitative insight into the roles played by these two torque terms .",
    "in the case of the current flowing in the @xmath19-direction , the magnitude of the effective spin current @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the magnetization and @xmath46 the spin current density @xmath47 which is proportional to the electrical current density @xmath48 and to the polarization @xmath49 .",
    "here , @xmath50 is the bohr magneton and @xmath51 the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "normally the spin current density is assumed to be temperature independent . in the following ,",
    "we extend the model so that a temperature dependent spin current @xmath52 is taken into account . under the assumption that the spin polarization is proportional to the magnetization , @xmath53 , and with @xmath54 , @xmath43 is @xmath55 for all temperatures .",
    "under these assumptions the spin torque terms can be expressed in terms of the reduced magnetization @xmath56 as @xmath57 note , that the spin torque now is temperature dependent via the variable @xmath56 which , within the framework of the llb equation , is no longer a unit vector of constant length . for the same reason , the adiabatic torque term can no longer be expressed as a double cross product .",
    "instead it is @xmath58 which means that the adiabatic term , within the llb equation , gives rise to an additional longitudinal spin torque term which vanishes in the llg equation due to the assumption of a constant length of the magnetization vector . as pointed out in ref .",
    "this term corresponds to the spin accumulation and in the metal systems considered here , it constitutes usually a small effect .",
    "it is not yet fully clear whether the spin torque term @xmath59 should be added to the landau - lifshitz or the landau - lifshitz - gilbert form of the equation of motion ( for more details see the discussion in refs .  ) .",
    "the same problem arises with the llb equation . in the following ,",
    "we extend the llb equation with both forms of the damping , the one after landau and lifshitz as well as the one after gilbert .",
    "the ll form of the llb equation ( eq .  [ e : llb ] ) is the original one as derived by garanin.@xcite eq .",
    "[ e : llb ] now reads with the additional spin torque terms from eq .",
    "[ e : spin - torque - llb ] @xmath60 neglecting terms of the order of @xmath61 the llb equation can be transformed into an equation with a damping term following gilbert .",
    "adding the same spin torque terms @xmath59 to this form of the llb equation yields @xmath62 note , that we use the notation @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the non - adiabatic prefactor only for convenience in order to distinguish in the following between the ll and llg form of the llb equation .",
    "in the next step we transform eq .",
    "[ e : llg - llb ] into an explicit form so that we are able to compare it with eq .",
    "[ e : ll - llb ] and also since an explicit equation is more convenient for a numerical treatment .",
    "this explicit equation can be derived once again neglecting terms of the order @xmath61 and @xmath65 and it is given by @xmath66 the only difference between eq .",
    "[ e : ll - llb ] assuming landau - lifshitz damping , and eq .",
    "[ e : ex - llg - llb ] assuming gilbert damping , is the prefactor of the last term .",
    "[ e : ll - llb ] and [ e : ex - llg - llb ] are mathematically identical for @xmath67 .",
    "note , that at both equations evolve into the well established explicit versions of the ll respectively llg equation with spin torque terms.@xcite",
    "in the following , we present analytical calculations for a one - dimensional system aligned along the @xmath19-direction .",
    "we extended well - established , analytical calculations @xcite to elevated temperatures using the llb equation as equation of motion .",
    "note , that within the llb approach domain wall profiles change with increasing temperature first from circular to elliptical and later on to linear.@xcite however , these effects occur only at higher temperatures close to @xmath4 ( depending on the strength of the anisotropy ) , and are neglected in our analytical calculations .",
    "hence , we assume a temperature independent domain wall type , which here is a transverse domain wall along the @xmath19-direction , which does not change its spin structure dynamically .",
    "this assumption , is later tested by comparison with numerical calculations without these approximations .",
    "the assumed domain wall profile is as usual@xcite @xmath68 with the temperature dependent domain wall width @xmath69 and the out - of - plane angle @xmath70 . in the low temperature limit",
    "this equation has the well known form , @xmath71 .",
    "the equations of motion are calculated as described in ref .  .",
    "we assume gilbert damping first , simply because it is the more common assumption in connection with spin torque calculations .",
    "for the domain wall profile above the equations of motion for the position of the domain wall @xmath72 and the angle @xmath70 are : @xmath73 these equations are calculated based on the original procedure ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the corresponding walker threshold @xmath74  @xcite can be calculated under the assumptions that @xmath75 and that the domain wall width @xmath76 reaches its minimum @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
    "the walker threshold is then given by @xmath79 and the average domain wall velocity is @xmath80 with the plus sign for @xmath81 and the minus sign otherwise .",

    "for @xmath88 the walker threshold diverges approaching zero temperature .",
    "the behavior for @xmath89 is similar , but here the walker threshold diverges at a finite temperature . as we will see in the following , the understanding of the temperature dependence of the walker threshold is the key for understanding the temperature dependence of the domain wall velocity .",
    "the equation of motion for landau - lifshitz damping ( eq .  [ e : ex - llg - llb ] ) can be calculated and solved in the same way as for the gilbert damping with corresponding results for the walker threshold and the average domain wall velocity for @xmath90 .",
    "note , however , that since this transformation is temperature dependent , the temperature dependence of both , walker threshold and domain wall velocity are different for landau - lifshitz and gilbert damping , respectively .",
    "the temperature dependence of the walker threshold assuming landau - lifshitz damping is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_walker_breakdown ] .",

    "this behavior can be explained by an analysis of the different terms of the extended llg equation ( eq .  [ e : ex - llg - llb ] ) : the first spin torque term which moves the domain wall is balanced by an `` internal '' torque due to the anisotropy contribution to the effective field .",
    "the displacement of the domain wall in @xmath19-direction is eventually stopped by the precessional term acting in the opposite direction , while the second spin torque term which is responsible for tilting the magnetization out of the easy plane is balanced by the damping term .",

    "<S> we extend the llb equation with spin torque terms that account for the effect of spin - polarized currents and we find that the velocities depend strongly on the interplay between adiabatic and non - adiabatic spin torque terms . as a function of temperature , </S>",
    "<S> we find non - monotonous behavior , which might be useful to determine the relative strengths of the spin torque terms experimentally . </S>"
