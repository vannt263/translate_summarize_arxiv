    "the electroweak production of single top quarks at hadron colliders @xcite is an important prediction of the standard model which remains to be verified .",
    "limits from run i at the tevatron have been published @xcite , and new limits from run ii are just now emerging @xcite . measuring",
    "single top quark production is important because it equates to the first direct measurement of the ckm matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , anomalous top quark couplings and a variety of proposed new physics models affect the three single - top - quark production modes in largely orthogonal ways .",
    "thus , independent measurements of all three channels provide a possible window to new physics @xcite , as well as for some discrimination between possible models .",
    "[ ptbhptbh ]    tb_tbq3.eps    one single - top - quark production mode , `` @xmath2 '' , occurs through diagrams such as figure [ tb_tbq]a , where an @xmath3-channel @xmath4 boson creates a top - bottom quark pair . a second , the so - called `` @xmath4-gluon fusion '' or `` @xmath5 ''",
    ", mode occurs through diagrams such as figure [ tb_tbq]b , where a @xmath6-channel @xmath4 boson fuses with a bottom quark from gluon splitting to form a top .",
    "the `` @xmath7 '' production mode @xcite occurs when a bottom quark and a gluon scatter to create a top quark and a real @xmath4 boson , as in figure [ tb_tbq]c .",
    "this last mode , which is smaller than @xmath5 , but larger than @xmath2 , is cleanly removed by the method outlined below , and will not be discussed at length .    the detector signature for",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath5 single - top production comes primarily from the decay products of the top quark : one lepton , missing energy transverse to the beam ( met ) from a neutrino , and one @xmath8 quark  all at high @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2 channel has a second large-@xmath10 @xmath8 quark , while the @xmath5 channel has both a low-@xmath9 @xmath8 quark from gluon splitting , which is rarely visible , and a moderately high-@xmath9 light quark .",
    "after showering and hadronization , short - distance quarks and gluons lead to `` jets '' of energy in detector calorimeters . to reduce backgrounds ,",
    "at least one jet in single top event selection samples is usually required to be `` @xmath8-tagged '' ( identified as containing a metastable hadron , probably with a @xmath8 quark constituent . )    at the lhc , the largest background to the @xmath2 and @xmath5 signal is @xmath0 pair production @xcite , where one or both of the top quarks decays leptonically , but only one lepton is identified .",
    "these events also have high-@xmath10 jets from @xmath8 quarks , and typically one or two other high-@xmath10 jets from light quarks .",
    "a second background is @xmath4 boson production with associated jets .",
    "for the present paper , this background will be divided into two sets : @xmath11 , where the @xmath8-tags come from @xmath8 quarks produced perturbatively in the hard scattering ; and @xmath12 , where the @xmath8-tags come from mistagging of charm , gluon , and light quark jets , and also the fragmentation of short - distance gluons to @xmath13 pairs .",
    "a third background comes from pure qcd processes , where a lepton is either misidentified or comes from the decay of a heavy - quark meson .",
    "the met for these qcd events comes from jet energy fluctuations in the calorimeter .",
    "this background is not estimated here , but is argued to be small for the method described below .",
    "the definitive signal - to - background study of single top quark production at the lhc has remained reference @xcite since its publication .",
    "the size of the @xmath0 background led the authors of @xcite to study a `` jet veto '' , wherein events with more than 2 jets were rejected .",
    "as @xmath0 typically has more than 2 jets per event , the jet veto removed greater than @xmath14 of this background . for the single @xmath8-tag sample , this technique was sufficient to study the @xmath5 channel .",
    "for the double @xmath8-tag sample , however , the jet veto could not sufficiently reduce @xmath0 to permit a study of either the @xmath5 or @xmath2 channels .",
    "fortunately , single top quark production is a very unusual process , with other features that can be used to separate it from backgrounds . at the tevatron ,",
    "single - top production has significantly larger parity asymmetries than its standard model backgrounds which can be used to help isolate the single top signal @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the parity - asymmetric @xmath15 initial state at the tevatron , versus the charge - asymmetric @xmath16 initial state at the lhc . at the lhc",
    ", single - top production has large charge asymmetries which can be used to separate it from backgrounds .",
    "for both the @xmath2 and @xmath5 channels , roughly @xmath17 more top quarks are produced at the lhc than anti - top quarks , and this difference is preserved in the charge of the leptons from the top quark decays .",
    "define @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) to be the number of events with one high-@xmath10 positively- ( negatively- ) charged lepton .",
    "then define @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and a charge asymmetry @xmath22 . for the cuts defined in table [ cuts1 ] ,",
    "the @xmath5 channel has a charge asymmetry of order @xmath23 and is the largest contributor to @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath2 channel has a charge asymmetry of order @xmath25 , but , because of its much smaller cross - section , does not contribute as significantly to @xmath24 .",
    "to first approximation , the @xmath0 background has a charge asymmetry of zero . but @xmath26 and @xmath27 are functions of both the event kinematic distributions and the acceptance regions of the detectors . at leading - order ( lo ) , the @xmath6 and @xmath28 distributions are identical , but at nlo there is a preference for @xmath28 quarks to be more central than @xmath6 quarks @xcite , so more @xmath0 events with leptons ( @xmath27 ) will be detected than with anti - leptons ( @xmath26 )",
    ". however , the magnitude of this asymmetry is estimated below to be smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "qcd backgrounds should have smaller charge asymmetries than @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the @xmath13 background has smaller nlo corrections to its distributions than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in addition , neutral @xmath30-meson mixing dilutes the charge correlation between the @xmath8 quarks and leptons , further reducing the contribution to @xmath24 . and",
    "to the extent that fake leptons from other qcd processes are charge symmetric , these also should not contribute significantly to @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath4+jets background , on the other hand , is more complicated .",
    "the sub - channels for this background do have significant asymmetries of varying magnitudes and signs .",
    "this will be discussed further below , but the size and uncertainty of this background s contribution to @xmath24 do not appear to be prohibitively large .",
    "finally , the @xmath7 production mode is charge - symmetric because the @xmath8 and @xmath31 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are believed to be charge - symmetric .",
    "there are also no known higher - order corrections to the kinematic distributions that would introduce a measurable charge asymmetry for this mode , and any future corrections are anticipated to be small .",
    "thus , considering charge asymmetries provides a clean way of separating the @xmath5 and @xmath2 modes from the @xmath7 mode .",
    "for the study below , madevent @xcite is used to generate both signal and background event samples with the cteq5 @xcite pdf set .",
    "single top @xmath2 events are generated with @xmath32=@xmath33=@xmath34=175 gev ( where @xmath32 and @xmath35 are the factorization and renormalization scales ) and normalized to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) pb @xcite for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) production .",
    "the @xmath40 event set is generated using the same scales as @xcite : @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the t - channel w boson momentum ) for the initial state quark pdf , and @xmath43 for the initial state gluon pdf .    at nlo ,",
    "the @xmath5 channel receives large contributions when the @xmath8 or @xmath31 quark from gluon - splitting is at low @xmath10 . in order to reflect this enhancement in a lowest - order ( lo ) simulation ,",
    "reference @xcite normalized the @xmath5 sample differentially depending on the @xmath10 of the @xmath8 or @xmath31 from gluon - splitting ( from here on , the @xmath8 or @xmath31 is referred to simply as `` the @xmath8 quark '' ) . in @xcite , the cross - section with the @xmath8 quark @xmath10 above 20 gev",
    "was determined at lo to be 81 pb , and the cross - section with the @xmath8 quark @xmath10 below 20 gev was normalized to 164 pb to match the total nlo cross - section of 245 pb @xcite .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite were not concerned with separating the @xmath40 and @xmath44 channels , so only the sum of the two was quoted .",
    "they are separated here by computing the ratio of the lo @xmath40 and @xmath44 cross - sections with the @xmath8 quark @xmath10 above 20 gev using madevent @xcite , and multiplying by 81 pb @xcite . for the @xmath8 quark @xmath10 above 20 gev , this leads to 52 pb for @xmath40 and 29 pb for @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath40 sample with the @xmath8 quark @xmath10 below 20 gev is normalized to 104 pb , so that when added to 52 pb , the total @xmath40 cross - section is equal to the total nlo rate of 156 pb @xcite .",
    "likewise , the @xmath44 sample with the @xmath8 quark @xmath10 below 20 gev is normalized to 62 pb to match the total nlo rate of 91 pb @xcite .",
    "note that the quoted total @xmath5 cross - sections in @xcite and @xcite differ by @xmath45 , which is negligible for the current analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 sample is generated with @xmath46 and normalized to 873 pb @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 sets are generated with @xmath32=@xmath33=@xmath47 and normalized with k - factors = 2.35 and 0.87 @xcite , respectively .",
    "these k - factors are taken from the study done in @xcite , under the assumption that they are the same for the slightly different cuts used here .",
    "the @xmath4+jets background is only simulated for @xmath4-plus - two jets , since the uncertainty in this prediction is probably as large as the @xmath4-plus - three jets contribution is likely to be .",
    "partons are mapped to jets by smearing their energies with a gaussian function of width @xmath48 , from table 9 - 1 in @xcite , to simulate showering and detector response .",
    "taus are treated as jets .",
    "leptons are required to be separated from jets by @xmath49 , and jets within @xmath49 of each other are merged .",
    "the @xmath8-tagging parametrizations for jets from bottom quarks , charm quarks , gluons , and light quarks are derived from figure 10 - 24 of @xcite , which assumes that jets from @xmath8 quarks are tagged at a fixed rate of @xmath50 .",
    "jets from charm quarks are tagged at an efficiency @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 , gluons at @xmath54 @xmath55 , and light quarks at @xmath56 @xmath57 . for the @xmath4+jets sample , using the cuts in table [ cuts1 ] , this is approximately equivalent to tagging charm quark , gluon , and light quark jets at fixed rates of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively .    for this study ,",
    "events are required to have met , one and only one charged lepton , and at least two jets , with one or two of them @xmath8-tagged .",
