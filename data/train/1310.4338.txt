    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) have been observed in both black hole and neutron star systems . for black hole systems qpo",
    "have been observed for a wide range of frequencies from mhz to a few hundred hz @xcite , while khz qpo have also been observed in neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "the high frequency of these oscillations suggests that they probably originate in the innermost regions of these system and hence in principle could be used to probe and test effects of general relativity in the strong field limit .",
    "since some of the low frequency qpo are observed to be correlated to the high frequency ones , they may have a common origin .",
    "moreover , a study of the temporal behavior of these systems ( particularly qpo activity ) could give new insight into the enigmatic nature of these systems .",
    "theoretical studies of the qpo phenomena have generally been restricted to identifying the different frequencies as natural characteristic frequencies of the system and correlation between them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a consistent model incorporating radiative and dynamic mechanisms , that translates the natural frequency of the system to an observable qpo , remains illusive .",
    "clues to such underlying processes can be obtained by studying the energy dependence of the qpo features like amplitude and phase lags ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially when harmonics are observed since additional information can be obtained for the same phenomenon .",
    "such an endeavor has been impeded , because the energy dependence of the phase lags for many qpo are observed to be complex and contrary to expectations @xcite .",
    "for example , the soft photons are often observed to lag the high energy ones @xcite which is contrary to simple comptonization models , although recent studies have shown that under certain conditions a soft lag could arise when more than one physical parameter is oscillating @xcite .",
    "further the time lags for low frequency qpo , @xmath2 hz , are often large , @xmath3 s @xcite and hence are probably not due to any radiative process and may be due to non - linear multiplicative reverberation effects @xcite .",
    "large time lags have also been observed for low frequency non periodic continuum fluctuations @xcite which are probably associated with the slow propagation of waves in an accretion disk @xcite or correspond to the rise / decay time of magnetic flares @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most unexpected results are that for some qpo , the phase lag for the odd and even harmonics have opposite signs .",
    "such alternating lag behavior have been observed at different frequencies , e.g. @xmath1 mhz @xcite and @xmath4 hz @xcite for grs 1915 + 105 and at @xmath4 hz for xte j1550 - 564 @xcite .",
    "possible explanations for such phenomena include partial covering models @xcite or due to radiative transport of photons through a hot comptonizing medium @xcite .",
    "@xcite in their model proposed that qpo arises due to the lense - thirring precession of the hot inner flow .",
    "based on this , @xcite explained the average spectrum and those of a qpo and its harmonic for xte j1550 - 564 , however it is not clear whether it can also explain the complex time - lag as function of energy . @xcite quote a recent work by @xcite where they have shown that the existance of a strong harmonic is predicted by the angular radiation pattern from comptonisation of a precessing hot inner flow .",
    "@xcite show that alternating lags for the @xmath4 hz can be explained by time delays due to comptonization but such a model is not applicable for the lower frequency qpo . since alternating time lags for different harmonics have been observed for different frequencies and for different systems , any model for the phenomena",
    "has to be sufficiently generic and should not depend on the details of qpo production and/or radiative mechanism .    in this work",
    ", such a generic model is presented .",
    "it is shown that alternating lags will occur under fairly general conditions if the qpo is due to the oscillation of two dependent physical parameters .",
    "the two parameters could characterize a single component of the spectrum or could correspond to two different spectral components .",
    "based on this interpretative framework , a phenomenological model is developed which can explain the complex energy dependent features of the @xmath1 mhz qpo observed in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "in particular , the amplitude and phase lags with energy for the fundamental and the next three harmonics ( a total of eight curves ) is explained with this model consisting of six parameters .",
    "predictions are made for the energy dependence of the phases of the bicoherence function which , in principle , can be checked with further analysis of the observational data .",
    "consider a photon spectrum @xmath5 , characterized by two physical parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , such that the temporal variations in the spectrum @xmath8 , are due to corresponding variations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 . if the response of the spectrum to the variations in the parameters is linear , then @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are time independent functions of energy . in the above equation",
    "it has been assumed that the radiative process time - scale ( @xmath14 msec , where @xmath15 is the optical depth and @xmath16 is the size of the system for a ten solar mass black hole ) is much shorter than the variability time - scale of the parameters . in other words ,",
    "the time lag between the parameter variations and the spectral response is negligible .    in this scenario ,",
    "the variations in the spectral parameters ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are caused by a driving dynamical oscillation which produces the qpo .",
    "it is further assumed that the variations in @xmath7 are also driven linearly by variations in @xmath6 after a time lag @xmath0 , that is , @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a time independent constant and @xmath21 denotes the direct coupling between the driving oscillation and @xmath7 .",
    "although the direct coupling term ( @xmath21 ) may not be negligible compared to the interactive term ( @xmath22 ) for some systems ( e.g. section 3 below ) , it is convenient to neglect @xmath21 at this stage , only to illustrate how such a model could produce alternating lags.with this assumption a simple equation for the phase lags can be written which explains the origin of the alternating lag behavior in a straight forward manner . neglecting @xmath21 and combining eqn .",
    "( [ eq : dels ] ) and ( [ eq : delb_a ] ) gives , @xmath23 \\label{eq : delsf}\\ ] ] where , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the fourier transforms of @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , @xmath28 is the angular frequency and @xmath29 .",
    "the cross - spectrum @xmath30 for two energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is defined as @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath34[1 + \\gamma_r ( e_2 ) e^{-i\\omega t_d } ] \\label{eq : cross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phase , @xmath35 , of the cross - spectrum divided by @xmath28 is generally identified as the time lag between the photons of energy @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from the form of eqn .",
    "[ eq : cross ] , it can be seen that this phase can be written as , @xmath36}{|c|}\\nonumber\\\\ &   = & { ( \\gamma_r ( e_1 ) - \\gamma_r ( e_2 ) ) \\hbox { sin } ( m \\omega_o t_d ) \\over |1 + \\gamma_r ( e_1 ) e^{i\\omega t_d}||1 + \\gamma_r ( e_2 ) e^{-i\\omega t_d}| } \\label{eq : tphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 has been replaced by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular frequency of the fundamental oscillation ( first harmonic ) and different values of the integer @xmath39 correspond to the other harmonics of the system . since the denominator of eqn .",
    "[ eq : tphi ] is always positive , the sign of the phase angle is determined by @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that the system will exhibit alternating lag signs for @xmath41 harmonics , provided @xmath0 lies within the range @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "for example , for a system with four harmonics with alternating lags ( like the 67 mhz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 ) , the time lag @xmath0 is restricted to lie between @xmath44 and @xmath45 of @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fundamental frequency .",
    "note that the phase @xmath48 depends on function @xmath49 ( eqn [ eq : tphi ] ) and in general could be small even though @xmath0 is required to be @xmath50 to satisfy condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) .",
    "it is useful to enumerate the different conditions that need to exist in a system for this model to be applicable .",
    "the first condition is that there needs to be at least two parameters which characterize the spectrum .",
    "this is generally true for most radiative models invoked to explain hard x - ray spectra .",
    "for example , in the comptonization model , the spectrum depends on the optical depth and temperature of the comptonizing region .",
    "it should be noted that the spectral parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 need not necessarily characterize the same spectral component .",
    "for example , @xmath6 could characterize a soft ( black body like ) component of the spectrum while @xmath7 could be related to the hard x - ray power - law which lags the intrinsic one after a time delay .",
    "the second condition is that two of the parameters should be related to each other ( eqn [ eq : delb_a ] ) .",
    "again it is probably true in general that variations in one parameter will induce variations in the other .",
    "the third condition is that @xmath0 , the interaction time - scale between the two parameters , is of the same order as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the qpo frequency . this would only be true for those phenomena where the qpo producing mechanism is similar to the one coupling the two parameters .",
    "for example , if the qpo is being produced by a dynamic process and the coupling between the two parameters is also of a dynamic nature , then it is expected that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the dynamic time - scale .",
    "finally the fourth condition is the restriction on @xmath0 for the system to show alternating lags ( eqn [ eq : cond ] ) .",
    "if the previous three conditions are satisfied for most of the systems , then this final criterion is expected to occur in a fraction of them . it should be emphasized that if there is an observation of alternating lags for a large number of harmonics of a qpo , then for this model to be applicable , @xmath0 would need to be `` fine tuned '' to satisfy eqn [ eq : cond ] .",
    "thus such a observation would indicate that this model is at least not in general applicable .",
    "however , for alternating lags up to three or four harmonics , condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) is not overtly restrictive . when the direct coupling @xmath21 is not negligible , the criterion for a system to exhibit alternating lags becomes more complex than eqn .",
    "[ eq : cond ] and depends on the strength and form of the interaction .",
    "in such cases , as shown in the next section , a more detailed calculation of the phase lags is required .",
    "a 67 mhz qpo with the next three harmonics with alternating lags was detected by rxte during 1996 may 5 observation of the black hole system grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "since the q factor for this qpo is large ( fwhm @xmath53 mhz for the fundamental ) , the underlying continuum is not expected to effect the phase lag results .",
    "this and the fact that a total of four harmonics were observed for this source makes this phenomenon an excellent candidate to test the generic model developed in the earlier section . to compare the observed values with ones predicted from the model , specific form and strength of the interactions between the driving oscillation and the spectral parameters have to be chosen",
    "here , such a specific set of interactions is presented which can explain the observed energy dependent trends of the qpo phase lag and amplitude .",
    "variations in the photon spectrum @xmath26 are assumed to be linearly driven by variations in two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( eqn [ eq : dels ] ) , such that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the time independent part of the spectrum the first term of the r.h.s is the linear response of the spectrum to perturbation in @xmath6 if @xmath56 , while the second term is for the case when @xmath57 .",
    "thus eqn ( [ eq : m1 ] ) corresponds to the situation when the spectrum can be described as an exponentially cut - off power - law ( @xmath58 ) with @xmath6 characterizing the inverse of the cutoff energy and @xmath7 the power - law slope . in this interpretation , @xmath59 is the pivot energy over which power - law component varies .",
    "this is partly motivated by observations of the high energy ( @xmath60 ) time averaged spectra of some black hole systems which can be approximately described as an exponentially cut - off power law .",
    "the time averaged spectrum for the observation showing the 67 mhz qpo , can be roughly ( at 2% level ) described as a exponentially cut - off power - law of index @xmath61 and cutoff energy @xmath62 kev .",
    "however , in general detailed spectral analysis of grs 1915 + 105 have shown that its spectrum is generally more complex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to avoid such complexities and to keep the temporal model presented here independent of specific spectral models , eqn ( [ eq : m1 ] ) is used here in this analysis with the caveat that in reality the response functions could be significantly more complex .",
    "the motivation here is to show that the generic model developed in section 2 , is applicable to the 67 mhz qpo and there exists a simple set of equations which can explain the complex behavior of this phenomenon .",
    "since harmonics are observed in this system , at least one of the parameters should couple non - linearly to the unknown driving mechanism that produces the qpo .",
    "further , since exactly four harmonics were observed , this suggests that the coupling is of a quartic nature .",
    "hence it is assumed here that , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the oscillating driver and @xmath65 is the coupling constant between it and @xmath6 .",
    "these variations in @xmath6 cause variations in @xmath7 ( eqn [ eq : delb_a ] ) with a time delay @xmath0 ,    @xmath66    here it is assumed that the direct coupling between the driving oscillation and @xmath7 ( @xmath21 ) is linear and in phase with interaction causing @xmath17 .",
    "eqn ( [ eq : m1 ] ) , ( [ eq : m2 ] ) and ( [ eq : m3 ] ) can now be solved to obtain the fractional rms amplitude and the phase lag as a function of energy for the fundamental and the next three harmonics .",
    "a detailed fitting to the observed data points would require convoluting the predicted time varying spectrum with the instrumental response function and binning the resultant folded spectrum in appropriate energy bins .",
    "however , since the motivation here is to show that qualitative trends in the data can be explained by the model , the theoretical variations are directly compared with the data points .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the six parameters required for the fit are @xmath67,@xmath65 , @xmath68,@xmath20,@xmath0 and @xmath69 .",
    "the phase lag as a function of energy for the three harmonics other than fundamental ( figure [ fig2 ] ) depends only on three of these parameters , @xmath67,@xmath20 and @xmath0 .",
    "the variation of the fractional amplitude with energy of the same harmonics depends on two additional parameters @xmath65 and @xmath68 , while the amplitude and phase lag of the fundamental with energy also depends on @xmath69 .",
    "it is encouraging to find that the observed relative amplitude of the different harmonics ( including the observation that the amplitude of the fourth harmonic is larger than the third ) can be explained by a simple non - linear equation ( [ eq : m2 ] ) .",
    "in particular the fourier transform of eqn ( [ eq : m2 ] ) leads to @xmath70 which when combined with eqn ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m3 ] ) sets the relative amplitude of the different harmonics ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however the interactions chosen here ( eqn . [ eq : m2 ] , [ eq : m3 ] ) may not be unique and it may be possible that there exists more complex non - linear relationships which also give similar results .",
    "for example , @xmath27 could be coupling non - linearly to @xmath71 instead of the driver i.e. @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a nonlinear function .",
    "however , such a function would give different phase lags between the harmonics than those computed using eqn ( [ eq : m2 ] ) .",
    "the phase lag between the harmonics can be indirectly measured using the phases of the bicoherence function which is defined as ( @xcite ) @xmath74 where the integer sub script on @xmath75 stands for different harmonics .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the predicted values of the phase of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 as a function of energy using eqn ( [ eq : m1 ] ) , ( [ eq : m2 ] ) and ( [ eq : m3 ] ) .",
    "these variations can be directly compared with the observed values to test the validity of these equations and confirm the model developed here .",
    "significant differences from the predicted values would perhaps indicate that the non - linear equation ( [ eq : m2 ] ) is more complex than the one assumed in this work .",
    "solid lines are model predictions ( from top to bottom : fundamental ( 1st harmonic ) , 2nd harmonic , 4th harmonic and 3rd harmonic ) .",
    "the six parameters used in this fit are @xmath79 kev , @xmath80 kev@xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 kev , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . , height=302 ]",
    ".,height=302 ]    .",
    "solid line : phase of @xmath76 ; dotted line : phase of @xmath77 ; dashed line : phase of @xmath78.,height=302 ]",
    "the phenomenological model presented here should be developed further to incorporate the specific radiative and dynamic mechanism that could be operating for this system .",
    "the inferred weak coupling between the parameters(@xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and the driving oscillation ( @xmath86 kev@xmath81 and @xmath87 ) , could occur if the driving oscillation is localized to some particular radius of the accretion disk and hence couples weakly with the parameters which are probably global averages .",
    "a localized driver would also naturally explain why the qpo is so narrow ( fwhm @xmath53 mhz ) since then the frequency could be associated with some natural frequency of the disk at that particular radius .",
    "however , it would then be difficult to understand why the time scale of interaction between the two ( global ) parameters @xmath0 is similar in magnitude to the timescale of the oscillation ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "if the form of the equation ( [ eq : m2 ] ) is correct that would indicate that the physical quantity associated with the driver can have negative values since @xmath89 .",
    "this means that the driving oscillation is not a positive physical quantity like temperature , density etc but needs to be associated with a quantity which can have negative values e.g. accretion rate , viscous stress etc .    in summary , a generic model for alternating lags for the harmonics of qpo has been presented .",
    "based on the generic model , a phenomenological one has been developed to explain the amplitude and phase lag variation with energy of the harmonics of the 67 mhz qpo observed in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the model can be further strengthened and/or modified by comparing the predicted values of the phase of the bi - coherence function with the ones inferred from observations .",
    "the model also puts restrictions on the radiative and dynamic mechanisms that are operating to produce this phenomenon .",
    "physical models developed in the framework of the phenomenological one will enhance our understanding of these systems .",
