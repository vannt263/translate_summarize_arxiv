    "the theoretical expectation for properties of quarks and gluons in the deconfinement phase is strongly required for an interpretation of experimental results in the heavy ion collision experiments . contrary to a naive quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) picture such as the gas of weakly interacting quarks and gluons , several model calculations inspired by qcd indicate nonperturbative features of qgp . for example , an njl model calculation suggests that the hadronic excitations survive as soft modes even above the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd can in principle solve the problem in a model independent way , since the dynamical properties of excitation modes can be extracted from the matsubara green functions @xcite .",
    "although in practice such studies are quite nontrivial even at qualitative level , recent technical development such as anisotropic lattices and computational progress have enabled us to study dynamical properties of hadrons at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition , several procedures such as the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite have been developed to analyze the spectral function with which we can directly probe the excitation modes of the plasma phase .",
    "these procedures have been applied to the charmonium systems and suggest that hadronic excitations survive even above the critical temperature @xcite .    in this work",
    "we apply the method which was adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite to systems with light quarks . in this report",
    "we focus on a check of reliability for applied analysis methods at finite temperature , as a preparation for future applications to the deconfinement phase .",
    "here we briefly explain our analysis procedure and its criteria for a reliability , which were in detail described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to extract reliable information on the spectral function , we use mem and @xmath0 fit method in a complementary manner . after a rough estimation of spectral function by mem ,",
    "we evaluate properties of the mode such as mass and width more quantitatively by the @xmath0 fit assuming several fitting forms based on mem results . as more sophisticated form of the @xmath0 fit",
    "we adopt the constrained curve fitting ( ccf ) @xcite whose prior knowledge is also estimated with the mem results .    to verify the reliability of our analysis",
    ", we require the following criteria for the extraction methods : ( 1 ) the stability of the spectral function against variations of input parameters or model functions .",
    "( 2 ) the stability of the result for the correlators at @xmath5 under restriction of the degrees of freedom . for the latter ,",
    "since the @xmath5 correlators are not ready at present , we instead analyze those below @xmath3 which should produce similar results as at @xmath5 .    in the previous work for the charmonium , in order to satisfy the criteria we employ the smearing operators which enhance the low frequency part of the meson correlators .",
    "however the smeared operators may produce artificial peaks in the spectral function @xcite . in order to distinguish an artificial peak from the genuine physical one we apply several smearing functions and examine the stability of the results .",
    "we use quenched lattices of the sizes @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and 32 which roughly correspond to @xmath8 and 0.9@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the zero temperature lattice , and the setup of lattice parameters are the same as those used in ref .",
    "the gauge configurations are generated with the wilson plaquette action at @xmath9 with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath10 .",
    "the spatial cutoff set by the hadronic radius @xmath11 is @xmath12 gev .",
    "@xmath13 is close to the phase transition .",
    "the quark action is the @xmath14 improved wilson action @xcite , with the hopping parameter roughly corresponding to the strange quark mass .",
    "we have 500 configurations at @xmath15 and 1000 configurations at @xmath16 .",
    "we measure the point correlators at @xmath5 and the smeared correlators at @xmath17 .",
    "for the latter , the operators are spatially extended by gaussian functions @xmath18 with @xmath19 and 0.037 which are referred as `` smeared '' and `` half - smeared '' , respectively .",
    "first we present a result for the point operators . using the correlators at @xmath5 we test the applicability to finite temperatures by varying the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath21 dependence of the mem results , where the fit ranges are restricted to @xmath22 .",
    "the result at @xmath23 can not reproduce even the position of the lowest peak , while @xmath23 corresponds to the similar situation we encounter at @xmath24 .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we give up to use the point operators to explore finite temperatures .",
    "the mem result with the smeared ps correlator at @xmath25 are presented in fig .",
    "the lowest and next - lowest peaks are located at almost the same positions as at @xmath5 which is expected to have a similar result to that at @xmath17 .",
    "this is encouraging for applications of the mem to the systems at @xmath16 .",
    "since the results are sensitive to the default model function ( as input parameters ) , it is difficult to obtain quantitative results only with mem .",
    "dependences of mass and width by ccf for the smeared and half - smeared ps correlators.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] +   dependences of mass and width by ccf for the smeared and half - smeared ps correlators.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    based on the mem results in fig .  [ fig2 ] , we assume multi - peak functions with the breit - wigner type forms , @xmath26 as fitting functions and estimate the prior knowledge of the ccf . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the fit results for masses and widths of the lowest and next - lowest peaks are displayed , where the results for smeared and half - smeared correlators are plotted with different symbols .",
    "although with a sufficiently large @xmath27 @xmath28 the results are stable , the differences between the values for the smeared and half - smeared correlators are larger than the statistical errors .",
    "furthermore the results are rather sensitive to the prior knowledge .",
    "these results indicate that we need further investigations of ccf to obtain quantitative results with keeping systematic uncertainties under control at finite temperature .    following our strategy",
    ", we have to perform these reliability checks with correlators at @xmath5 and to examine the @xmath21 dependence of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "we also need further examination of the smearing operators , because the suppression of high frequency part of the correlators may not be sufficient with the present smearing operators .",
    "this might be a reason that ccf does not work stably at @xmath17 .",
    "these problems must be clarified for reliable analysis of the hadronic correlators at finite temperature , in particular in the plasma phase .",
