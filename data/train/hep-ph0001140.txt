    "the indirect search reach for new gauge bosons at future colliders has been the subject of much investigation but with few new results in the past couple of years except for refinements of previously existing analyses .",
    "we refer the reader to the summaries provided in ref.@xcite .",
    "in theories with extra dimensions , @xmath1 , the gauge fields of the standard model(sm ) will have kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations if they are allowed to propagate in the bulk of the extra dimensions .",
    "if such a scenario is realized then , level by level , the masses of the excited states of the photon , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and gluon would form highly degenerate towers .",
    "the possibility that the masses of the lowest lying of these states could be as low as @xmath4 a few tev or less leads to a very rich and exciting phenomenology at future and , possibly , existing colliders@xcite . for the case of one extra dimension compactified on @xmath5 the spectrum of the excited states",
    "is given by @xmath6 and the couplings of the excited modes relative to the corresponding zero mode to states remaining on the wall at the orbifold fixed points , such as the sm fermions , is simply @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "if such kk states exist what is the lower bound on their mass ?",
    "we already know from direct @xmath9 and dijet bump searches at the tevatron from run i that they must lie above @xmath10 tev . a null result for a search made with data from run ii will push this limit to @xmath11 tev .",
    "to do better than this at present we must rely on the indirect effects associated with kk tower exchange .",
    "such limits rely upon a number of additional assumptions , in particular , that the effect of kk exchanges is the _ only _ new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the strongest and least model - dependent of these bounds arises from an analysis of charged current contact interactions at both hera and the tevatron@xcite where one obtains a bound of @xmath12 tev .",
    "similar analyses have been carried out by a number of authors@xcite ; the best limit arises from an updated combined fit to the precision electroweak data as presented at the 1999 summer conferences and yields@xcite @xmath13 tev for the case of one extra dimension . from the previous discussion we can also draw a further conclusion for the case @xmath14 : the lower bound @xmath15 tev is so strong that the _ second _ kk excitations , whose masses must now exceed 7.8 tev due to the above scaling law , will be beyond the reach of the lhc and thus the lhc will _ at most _ only detect the first set of kk excitations for @xmath14 .    in all analyses that obtain indirect limits on @xmath16 ,",
    "one is actually constraining a dimensionless quantity such as @xmath17 where , generalizing the case to @xmath18 additional dimensions , @xmath19 is the coupling and @xmath20 the mass of the @xmath21 kk level labelled by the set of @xmath18 integers *",
    "n * and @xmath22 is the @xmath3 boson mass which we employ as a typical weak scale factor . for @xmath14",
    "this sum is finite since @xmath6 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 ; one immediately obtains @xmath25 with @xmath16 being the mass of the first kk excitation . from the precision data one obtains a bound on @xmath26 and then uses the above expression to obtain the corresponding bound on @xmath16 . for @xmath27 , however , independently of how the extra dimensions are compactified , the above sum in @xmath26 _ diverges _ and so it is not so straightforward to obtain a bound on @xmath16 .",
    "we also recall that for @xmath27 the mass spectrum and the relative coupling strength of any particular kk excitation now become dependent upon how the additional dimensions are compactified .",
    "there are several ways one can deal with this divergence : ( @xmath28 ) the simplest approach is to argue that as the states being summed in @xmath26 get heavier they approach the mass of the string scale , @xmath29 , above which we know little and some new theory presumably takes over .",
    "thus we should just truncate the sum at some fixed maximum value @xmath30 so that masses kk masses above @xmath29 do not contribute .",
    "( @xmath31 ) a second possibility is to note that the wall on which the sm fermions reside is not completely rigid having a finite tension . the authors in ref.@xcite argue that this wall tension can act like an exponential suppression of the couplings of the higher kk states in the tower thus rendering the summation finite , , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 now parameterizes the strength of the exponential cut - off .",
    "antoniadis@xcite has argued that such an gaussian suppression can also arise from considerations of string scattering amplitudes at high energies .",
    "( @xmath34 ) a last scenario@xcite is to note the possibility that the sm wall fermions may have a finite size in the extra dimensions which smear out and soften the couplings appearing in the sum to yield a finite result . in this case",
    "the suppression is also of the gaussian variety .",
    "table i shows how the @xmath14 lower bound of 3.9 tev for the mass of @xmath16 changes as we consider different compactifications for @xmath27 .",
    "we see that in some cases the value of @xmath16 is so large it will be beyond the mass range accessible to the lhc as it is for all cases of the @xmath35 example .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "let us return to the @xmath14 case at the lhc where the degenerate kk states @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are potentially visible .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for masses in excess of @xmath40 tev the @xmath39 resonance in dijets will be washed out due to its rather large width and the experimental jet energy resolution available at the lhc detectors . furthermore , @xmath36 and @xmath37 will appear as a _",
    "single _ resonance in drell - yan that can not be resolved and looking very much like a single @xmath0 as can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "thus if we are lucky the lhc will observe what appears to be a degenerate @xmath9 .",
    "how can we identify these states as kk excitations when we remember that the rest of the members of the tower are too massive to be produced ?",
    "we remind the reader that many extended electroweak models exist which predict a degenerate @xmath9 . without further information",
    ", it would seem likely that this would become the most likely guess of what had been found . in the case of the 4 tev resonance",
    "there is sufficient statistics that the kk mass will be well measured and one can also imagine measuring the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath41 , if not the full angular distribution of the outgoing leptons , since the final state muon charges can be signed",
    ". however , for such a heavy resonance it is unlikely that much further information could be obtained about its couplings and other properties based on the conclusion of several years of @xmath0 analyses .",
    "thus we will never know from lhc data alone whether the first kk resonance has been discovered or , instead , some extended gauge model scenario has been realized . to make further progress",
    "we need a lepton collider .",
    "it is well - known that future @xmath42 linear colliders(lc ) operating in the center of mass energy range @xmath43 tev will be sensitive to indirect effects arising from the exchange of new @xmath0 bosons with masses typically 6 - 7 times greater than @xmath44@xcite .",
    "this sensitivity is even greater in the case of kk excitations since towers of both @xmath45 and @xmath2 exist all of which have couplings larger than their sm zero modes .",
    "furthermore , analyses have shown that with enough statistics the couplings of the new @xmath0 to the sm fermions can be extracted@xcite in a rather precise manner , especially when the @xmath0 mass is already approximately known from elsewhere , , the lhc . in the present situation",
    ", we imagine that the lhc has discovered and determined the mass of a @xmath0-like resonance in the 4 - 6 tev range .",
    "can the lc tell us anything about the couplings of this object ?",
    "we find that it is sufficient for our arguments below to do this solely for the leptonic channels .",
    "the idea is the following : we measure the deviations in the differential cross sections and angular dependent left - right polarization asymmetry , @xmath46 , for the three lepton generations and combine those with @xmath47 polarization data .",
    "assuming lepton universality(which would be observed in the lhc data anyway ) , that the resonance mass is well determined , and that the resonance is an ordinary @xmath0 we perform a fit to the hypothetical @xmath0 coupling to leptons . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the case of only one extra dimension with a 4 tev kk excitation and employ a @xmath48 gev collider with an integrated luminosity of 200 @xmath49 .",
    "the result of performing this fit demonstrate , as shown in ref.@xcite , that the coupling values are ` well determined ' , , the size of the @xmath50 cl allowed region we find is quite small as we would have expected from previous @xmath0 analyses .",
    "the only problem with the fit is that the @xmath51 is very large leading to a very small confidence level , , @xmath52 or cl=@xmath53 ! for an ordinary @xmath0 it has been shown that fits of much higher quality , based on confidence level values , are obtained by this same procedure .",
    "fig.2 shows the results for the cl following the above approach as we vary both the luminosity and the mass of the first kk excitation at a 500 gev @xmath42 linear collider . from this analysis",
    "one finds that the resulting cl is below @xmath54 for a first kk excitation with a mass of 4(5,6 ) tev when the integrated luminosity at the 500 gev collider is 200(500,900)@xmath49 whereas at a 1 tev for excitation masses of 5(6,7 ) tev we require luminosities of 150(300,500)@xmath49 to realize this same cl . barring some unknown systematic effect the only conclusion that one could draw from such bad fits is that the hypothesis of a single @xmath0 , and the existence of no other new physics , is simply _",
    "wrong_. if no other exotic states are observed below the first kk mass at the lhc , this result would give very strong indirect evidence that something more unusual than a conventional @xmath0 had been found but it _ can not _ prove that this is a kk state .",
    "in order to be completely sure of the nature of the first kk excitation , we must produce it directly at a higher energy lepton collider and sit on and near the peak of the kk resonance . to reach this mass range",
    "will most likely require a muon collider .",
    "sitting on the resonance there are a very large number of quantities that can be measured : the mass and apparent total width , the peak cross section , various partial widths and asymmetries . from the @xmath2-pole studies at slc and lep , we recall a few important tree - level results which we would expect to apply here as well provided our resonance is a simple @xmath0 .",
    "first , we know that the value of @xmath55 , as measured on the @xmath2 by sld , does not depend on the fermion flavor of the final state and second , that the relationship @xmath56 holds , where @xmath57 is the polarized forward - backward asymmetry as measured for the @xmath2 at slc and @xmath58 is the usual forward - backward asymmetry . the above relation is seen to be trivially satisfied on the @xmath2(or on a @xmath0 ) since @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . both of these relations are easily shown to fail in the present case of a ` dual ' resonance though they will hold if only one particle is resonating .",
    "a short exercise@xcite yields the results in fig.2 explicitly showing the flavor dependence of @xmath55 . in principle , to be as model independent as possible in a numerical analysis , we should allow the individual widths @xmath62 of the two resonances to be greater than or equal to their sm values as such heavy kk states may decay to sm susy partners as well as to presently unknown exotic states .",
    "since the expressions above only depend upon the ratio of widths , we let @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the width ratio obtained assuming that the kk states have only sm decay modes .",
    "we then treat @xmath65 as a free parameter in what follows and explore the range @xmath66 . once @xmath65 is determined from the value of one observable all of the electroweak parameters of the dual resonance are completely fixed and can directly compared with data proving that a composite resonance corresponding to the first kk excitation has been discovered@xcite .    in figs .",
    "3a and 3b we show that although on - resonance measurements of the electroweak observables , being quadratic in the @xmath37 and @xmath36 couplings , will not distinguish between the usual kk scenario and that of the arkani - hamed and schmaltz(as ) ( whose kk couplings to quarks are of opposite sign from the conventional assignments for odd kk levels since quarks and leptons are assumed to be separated by a distance @xmath67 in their scenario ) the data below the peak in the hadronic channel will easily allow such a separation .",
    "the cross section and asymmetries for @xmath68 is , of course , the same in both cases .",
    "such data can be collected by using radiative returns if sufficient luminosity is available",
    ". the combination of on and near resonance measurements will thus completely determine the nature of the resonance as well as the separation between various fermions on the wall .",
    "fig.4 shows that with even larger energies muon colliders will be able to probe both the number of extra dimensions as well as the geometry of their compactification manifolds since these can be uniquely determined by the kk excitation spectrum .",
