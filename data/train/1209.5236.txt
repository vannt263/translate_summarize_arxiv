    "in the study of complex systems , it is common to invoke assumptions under which the dimension ( and hence complexity ) of the system is reduced ; such a strategy often leads to relatively simple theories capable of exact analytical predictions , which offer insights typically lost in numerical approaches .",
    "this approach is particularly useful in the study of biochemical pathway dynamics which typically involve the interaction of hundreds or thousands of different chemical species @xcite .",
    "deterministic models of such systems are frequently simplified by invoking the presence of well - separated timescales @xcite , in particular by means of the quasi - steady - state approximation ( qssa ) @xcite .",
    "however it is well appreciated nowadays that a discrete stochastic approach in terms of chemical master equations ( cmes ) is more faithful in describing dynamics inside living cells since the number of molecules of many species is in the range of few tens to few thousands @xcite .",
    "the development of reduced stochastic models consistently coarse - grained over timescales presents a significantly larger challenge than the reduction of deterministic models because of the much larger number of differential equations which need to be solved in the former compared to the latter .",
    "indeed it has been shown that it is not possible to formulate a reduced cme for the whole region of parameter space in which the deterministic qssa is valid but rather only over a subset of this space @xcite .",
    "for example consider the michaelis - menten mechanism in which substrate reversibly binds with enzyme to form an enzyme - substrate complex which then decays into product .",
    "we are interested in conditions such that the substrate species decays over a much longer timescale than the enzyme and complex species . for this case , a consistently reduced cme",
    "can only be written provided that the complex decay rate into product is much less than its decay rate into substrate and enzyme which is not necessarily the case @xcite .",
    "however it is possible to write down reduced deterministic rate equations ( res ) using the qssa even when the aforementioned condition is not satisfied !",
    "@xcite    recently we have shown that a reduced stochastic description with the same range of validity as the deterministic qssa is possible .",
    "this reduction is achieved by first approximating the cme by linear langevin equations , an approximation called the linear noise approximation ( lna ) and then integrating out the fast fluctuations such that one obtains a reduced set of linear langevin equations for the fluctuations in the slowly varying species only .",
    "the latter is the slow - scale lna ( sslna ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the sslna over the reduced cme approach is that the former is valid over the same range of parameter space as the qssa , a claim which has been numerically verified for a number of biochemical circuits including cooperative and non - cooperative enzyme reactions and gene networks with or without negative feedback regulation @xcite .",
    "the sslna , as it currently stands , has been derived by means of simple and intuitively clear physical arguments but is lacking a formal and rigorous derivation . in this article",
    "we provide such a derivation and also show the relationship of the sslna with other common methods of stochastic model reduction based on timescale separation assumptions .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in sec .",
    "[ full - lna ] , we consider the cme of a general system of elementary chemical reactions with two characteristic and clearly separated timescales and reformulate the conventional system size expansion of the cme under such conditions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sslna ] we use the leading order terms of the expansion to show that the deterministic limit of the cme under timescale separation conditions is formally the same as the conventional reduced rate equations obtained from the qssa .",
    "the next to leading order terms of the expansion provide us with a fokker - planck equation which we reduce to a simpler fokker - planck equation for the slow fluctuations only , by means of the projection operator formalism .",
    "the reduced fokker - planck equation is obtained in closed - form for all monostable reaction networks and is the same as the sslna obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : rel ] we show how the large molecule number limit of conventional stochastic reduction methods leads to a special case of the sslna and that hence these methods provide results in a more restrictive range of parameter space than the sslna does .",
    "the methodology of our approach is summarized in fig . 1 .",
    "we consider a system that comprises @xmath0 chemical species @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) confined in a compartment of volume @xmath3 and assume that the species can interact via @xmath4 elementary chemical reactions @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the stoichiometric coefficients @xcite and @xmath8 is the macroscopic reaction rate .",
    "the constraint @xmath9 for all @xmath10 implies that the reactions are unimolecular or bimolecular and hence elementary .",
    "the total number of species @xmath0 is assumed to comprise @xmath11 slow and @xmath12 fast species , respectively . for convenience ,",
    "we stick to the convention that @xmath13 to @xmath14 denote the slow species , while @xmath15 to @xmath16 are reserved for the fast species .    in",
    "what follows , matrices are denoted by underlined quantities and all vectors are column vectors .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the number of molecules of species @xmath18 , then the probability @xmath19 to find the system in a particular state @xmath20 is determined by the cme @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the stoichiometric matrix and @xmath23 is a step operator , the action of which on some function of the absolute number of molecules results in the same function but with @xmath17 replaced by @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the entries of the microscopic rate function vector .",
    "the product @xmath26 represents the propensity function , which has the meaning of the probability that reaction @xmath10 takes place in a small time interval @xmath27 .",
    "the cme is typically analytically intractable and hence a systematic approximation method is needed .",
    "the system size expansion as developed by van kampen is one such technique @xcite .",
    "the heart of the method is the ansatz that the molecular concentration of the cme can be written as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is vector of concentrations as given by the corresponding res and the second term on the right hand side is a stochastic term describing fluctuations about the concentrations of the res .",
    "we now impose timescale separation conditions , i.e. , we assume that the transients in concentrations of a group of species decays much slower than those of the remaining group of species .",
    "the first group of species we label as the slow species while the second are the fast species .",
    "the characteristic timescales of these two are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the vectors of molecular populations , of macroscopic concentrations and of fluctuations can be divided into subpopulations of slow and fast species : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ vkoriginalansatz ] ) can then be written as : @xmath35 we now use this ansatz to derive an expansion of the cme in powers of the small parameter @xmath36 valid in the case of large volumes or , equivalently , for large copy numbers of molecules . for convenience the components of the various vectors will be denoted as follows : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the probability distribution of molecular populations @xmath19 is hence forth changed into the distribution of slow and fast fluctuations @xmath41 . in what follows",
    "we consider how the time derivative , the step operator and the microscopic rate function vector which compose the cme eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) transform under the proposed ansatz eq .",
    "( [ lna - ansatz ] ) .      using the change of variable theorem the time derivative can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "note that @xmath53 denotes some general function of the molecule numbers .",
    "applying the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ lna - ansatz ] ) it follows that the above equation can be written as @xmath54 the right hand side of the above equation can be taylor expanded from which it follows that the step operator for the @xmath55 reaction has the following formal expansion in powers of the inverse square root of the system volume : @xmath56^k .",
    "\\label{eqn : stepoperator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we consider four general types of elementary reactions depending on the order @xmath10 of the reaction , for which the microscopic rate functions have been rigorously derived from microscopic considerations @xcite : ( i ) @xmath57 , for a zeroth - order reaction by which a species is input into a compartment ; ( ii ) @xmath58 , for a first - order unimolecular reaction describing the decay of some species @xmath59 ; ( iii ) @xmath60 for a second - order bimolecular reaction between two molecules of the same species @xmath59 ; ( iv ) @xmath61 , for a second - order bimolecular reaction between two molecules of different species , @xmath59 and @xmath62 .",
    "with each of these cases one can also associate a macroscopic rate function , @xmath63 , i.e. , the rate of reaction as given by the corresponding rate equations .",
    "for the four cases discussed above these are : ( i)@xmath64 ; ( ii ) @xmath65 ; ( iii ) @xmath66 ; ( iv ) @xmath67 , where @xmath68 if @xmath50 and @xmath69 if @xmath70 .    given the microscopic and macroscopic rate functions for the four elementary reactions , one can write the former in terms of the latter , leading to the general result @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the vectors of derivatives with respect to the components of the vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .    this formula can be easily verified by considering each of the four elementary reactions discussed above .",
    "for example for case of a second - order @xmath76 reaction involving a slow species @xmath59 and a fast species @xmath62 , we have @xmath77 where we used the definitions of the microscopic and macroscopic rate functions given above and the ansatz eq.([lna - ansatz ] ) .      substituting eqs .",

    "such a set of equations present a special case in singular perturbation theory , where eqs .   and for the slow and fast variables",
    "are typically referred to as the degenerate and adjoined systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "first theorem @xcite states that a simplification of the above equations under timescale separation conditions is possible whenever certain requirements are met : i ) the solutions of both the degenerate and adjoined systems , eqs .",

    "whenever these prerequisites are met , the solution of the full system for @xmath74 tends to the solution of the reduced system @xmath95 in the limit of timescale separation , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath97 is the solution of @xmath98 .",
    "these requirements are typically fulfilled for the biochemical networks of interest .",
    "this is since the chemical transformation scheme is formulated for elementary reactions , which are bimolecular or simpler , the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "are continuous polynomial functions of the second order at most . for monostable networks ,",
    "the rate equations admit a single steady state which is the same for the full and the reduced res , i.e. , eq .   and  .",
    "it is therefore clear that all the solutions will tend to this state with time , quicker for fast variables and slower for the slow ones .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we reviewed how imposing timescale separation on the deterministic level leads to reduced time evolution equations for the concentrations of the slow species . a related question which is the main issue of this article is : what is the reduced fokker - planck equation describing the fluctuations about the concentrations predicted by the deterministic qssa ?",
    "the fokker - planck equation describing the fluctuations in the concentrations of both fast and slow species is given by the @xmath99 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cmeexp ] ) ; this has the form    @xmath100 from the definitions of the operators eq .",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath92 here weights the degree of timescale separation in the system .",
    "the fact that @xmath92 is the same as for the deterministic qssa implies that the conditions for timescale separation of the stochastic variables , in the limit of large @xmath3 , are exactly the same as those for the res .    for well - separated timescales , i.e. , the case @xmath104 , we are typically interested in the probability distribution of slow variables , @xmath105 .",
    "projection operator methods have been found useful in facilitating the adiabatic elimination of fast variables from stochastic descriptions @xcite .",
    "here we use one such method to rigorously obtain a reduced fokker - planck equation for the fluctuations in the concentrations of the slow variables .",
    "the main idea behind the projection operator method is that one specifies the quasi steady - state probability distribution @xmath106 of fast fluctuations , which is determined by the infinite @xmath92-limit of eq .",

    "besides the qssa there exists another popular method to eliminate the fast variables from the deterministic res ; this is the rapid - equilibrium approximation @xcite .",

    "the disadvantage of the sslna is that for pathways composed of some second order reactions , the sslna ( and the lna on which it is based ) is valid only for large enough molecule numbers @xcite .",
    "this limitation can be lifted by consideration of higher order terms in the system size expansion ; such calculations present more formidable analytical challenges than encountered in the derivation of the sslna and are under current investigation .     for realistic biochemical networks there may be particular parameter ranges for which the stability of the dynamics is either monostable or bistable or even oscillatory states can occur .",
    "the applicability of the method therefore depends on the type of stability realized for a particular network under consideration .",
    "oscillatory states are found for @xmath215% of the transcriptome and @xmath216% of the proteome in mouse liver @xcite and similar fractions in the human metabolome @xcite .",
    "although bimodal distributions have been observed experimentally , as for instance in the _ lac _ operon of e. coli @xcite , a recent proteome - wide study suggests that such probability distributions ( which potentially indicate bistability ) are quite rare @xcite and similarly for the human transcriptome @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that bistable and oscillatory properties are important for specific cellular functions , it appears that monostable networks for which the present theory has been developed are common in living cells .",
    "we note that the lna has been applied also to networks with limit cycles @xcite .",
    "the resulting equation is still a linear fokker - planck equation and hence the elimination of fast variables can be performed along the same lines as in the present derivation .",
    "however , the analysis of the resulting equation has to be carried out by means of floquet theory due to the inherent phase diffusion in these systems @xcite . for bistable systems ,",
    "the underlying distribution can not be captured by a linear fokker - planck eq . and",
    "hence the lna is not applicable in this case @xcite .",
    "a commonly employed procedure to eliminate fast variables in such systems is the stochastic qssa .",
    "a recent numerical study reported considerable discrepancies in the probability distributions of full and qssa - reduced bistable systems @xcite .",
    "we expect these discrepancies to be similar to the difference in the sslna and rapid - equilibrium approximations discussed in this article for the monostable case .",
    "therefore , developing a technique to rigorously reduce the cme of bistable networks remains still an open question . since our method",
    "is devised for monostable systems and can be extended to oscillatory ones under timescale separation conditions we expect it to be of broad applicability for the study of intracellular reaction networks .",
