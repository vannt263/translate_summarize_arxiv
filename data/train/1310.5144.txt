    "if a correlation between phase and atmospheric pressure holds for wise 1049b , we use the publicly available bt - settl 1d atmospheric models ( allard et al . 2012 ) to estimate the pressure levels probed by the grond bandpasses .",
    "the bt - settl models utilize a sophisticated cloud model which realistically takes into account the mixing properties of the atmosphere , as determined by 2d radiation hydrodynamic simulations ( freytag et al .",

    "we then assign an effective photospheric pressure level to each wavelength using the model s temperature - pressure profile , which provides a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting `` pressure spectrum '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] ) shows that stronger absorption features correspond to deeper photospheric pressure levels . using the model s emergent flux density and the product of the telluric and grond filter transmission profiles , we calculate a mean photospheric pressure for each band and the upper and lower pressure limits within which 80% of that bandpass flux is emitted .",
    "the bandpasses probing deepest in the atmosphere are @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ( @xmath23  bar ) ; the extremum in wise 1049b s photometry occurs at nearly the same time ( i.e. , rotational phase ) in these three filters , as they probe roughly the same depth in the atmosphere .",
    "we also note that the three filters which probe higher layers of the atmosphere ( @xmath24  bar ; in @xmath1 and @xmath2 because of absorption by alkalis , and in @xmath6 because of increasing molecular absorption ) all exhibit flux extrema offset from @xmath3 by @xmath25100  deg . as plotted in fig .",

    "2013 ) , phase shifts indicate that the vertical and horizontal structure of the atmosphere must also explicitly be taken into account . in particular , 1d models can not consider the strong effects of rotation on atmospheric structure . showman and kaspi ( 2013 ) find evidence for large scale ( @xmath261000 km ) atmospheric circulation in three - dimensional , global , anelastic numerical simulations of convection in rapidly rotating brown dwarfs ( @xmath279 hour period ) .",
    "this produces horizontal temperature variations of up to 50 k as well as significant vertical mixing , driving cloud patterns to evolve on 10 - 100 rotation period timescales .",
    "2d radiation hydrodynamics simulations by freytag et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that gravity waves can also play a significant role in forming and dispersing dust clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres , but on somewhat smaller scales . in the case of 2 m 2228 , buenzli et al .",
    "2012 suggest a possible `` stacked cell '' scenario to produce the observed phase shifts , where two convective cells are stacked vertically , one moving upward ( ascent ) the other downward ( subsidence ) .",

    "the anti - correlated lightcurves may be produced by the combination of patchy cloud layers deeper in the photosphere ( driving variability in @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ) and horizontal temperature differences in the higher layers of the photosphere ( producing the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 variability ) .",

    "<S> we obtained 4 hours of focused observations on the night of ut 2013 - 04 - 22 , as well as 4 hours of defocused ( unresolved ) observations on the night of ut 2013 - 04 - 16 . </S>",
    "<S> we note a number of robust trends in our light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 and @xmath2 light curves appear to be anticorrelated with @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the t0.5 component and in the unresolved lightcurve . in the defocused dataset , @xmath5 appears correlated with @xmath3 and @xmath4 and anticorrelated with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while in the focused dataset we measure no variability for @xmath5 at the level of our photometric precision , likely due to evolving weather phenomena . in our focused t0.5 component lightcurve , the @xmath6 band lightcurve displays a significant phase offset relative to both @xmath4 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the measured phase offsets are correlated with atmospheric pressure probed at each band , as estimated from 1d atmospheric models . </S>",
    "<S> we also report low - amplitude variability in @xmath2 and @xmath3 intrinsic to the l7.5 component . </S>"
