    "the first detections of the quasar clustering date back more than one decade ( @xcite , @xcite ) . up to now , however , more detailed studies of the clustering dependence on physical parameters like absolute magnitude and redshift was hampered by the small number of quasars in statistically well - defined samples .",
    "recent studies of complete quasars samples ( @xcite ) found either no significant difference in the clustering amplitude measured in comoving coordinates at low ( @xmath21 ) and high ( @xmath22 ) redshift , or marginal detections of a decrease of the quasar clustering with redshift .",
    "but the uncertainties were still quite large .",
    "the spatial two - point correlation function , @xmath23 , expresses the deviation of the observed spatial distribution from a random distribution .",
    "an estimator for the correlation function is @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the number of quasars pairs observed at the separations in the range @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the number of pairs counted at the same separation in an artificial random catalogue .",
    "a common parameterization used to describe the evolving correlation function of galaxies is @xmath29 , where the length is measured in physical ( proper ) coordinates and @xmath30 is an arbitrary fitting parameter .",
    "if the separation length is measured in comoving coordinates the above relation becomes    @xmath31    another estimate of the clustering properties can be obtained via the integrated pair counts @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the advantage in calculating the integrated two - point correlation function is that it is stable and does not depend on the binning when @xmath34 is large . when the boundary effect is negligible , @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the number of observed and random simulated pairs respectively , at a distance less than @xmath34 .",
    "we assume @xmath39 , @xmath40 km s@xmath41 mpc@xmath41 and comoving distances throughout .",
    "in order to improve the s / n in the estimate of the clustering evolution , we have built a new sample of 388 quasars down to @xmath42 over a _",
    "contiguous _ area of 24.6 deg@xmath3 with redshift in the range @xmath43 .",
    "we define quasars as broad emission line agns having @xmath44 with @xmath39 and @xmath45 km s@xmath41 mpc@xmath41 .",
    "this is the largest sample of quasars of this type yet made .",
    "the candidates were observed with the meudon - eso fibre optic system ( mefos , @xcite ) at the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the sample is centered in the south galactic pole region where some of the durham / aat sample areas are included ( @xcite ) , and part of the high redshift quasar survey of @xcite was carried out .",
    "206 quasars are newly identified .",
    "the field is part of the homogeneous bright quasar survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the quasars were selected through the ultraviolet excess ( uvx ) color criterion in the @xmath46 versus @xmath47 plane .",
    "the sample is divided in two regions : in the central _ region a _ ( with an area of 9 deg@xmath3 ) , including 176 quasars , the sample is complete ( the surface density is 19.7 quasars / deg@xmath3 for @xmath1 ) , while in _ region b _ ( with an area of 16 deg@xmath3 ) , including 212 quasars , a fraction of the quasar candidates is still not observed , resulting in an incompleteness of about @xmath48 . the sample with the full quasar catalogue will be described in a forthcoming paper ( la franca et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "because of the incompleteness in the _ region b _ of the quasar sample , the overall nonuniform spatial distribution of the quasars complicates the generation of the `` random '' data sets used in the computation of the correlation function . in order to guarantee that the random data set had exactly the same spatial selection function as the quasar sample , each of the random data sets was drawn from exactly the same ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) positions as the overall quasar sample",
    ". in each random data set ,",
    "these positions were assigned different , random , redshifts .",
    "we adopted three different methods for assigning the random redshifts and implemented these in three independent codes for computing @xmath51 . in the three methods",
    "the redshifts were generated ( 1 ) random , from the observed @xmath52 binned in intervals of 0.1 in @xmath20 ; ( 2 ) random , according to the distribution expected on the basis of the quasar luminosity function ( @xcite ) ; ( 3 ) scrambling the observed redshifts of the quasars in the sample . in the simulation of the quasar",
    "redshifts the sample was splitted into two sub - samples : a bright ( @xmath53 ) and a faint ( @xmath54 ) one .",
    "this differentiation is necessary as the bright sample is complete over the whole ( _ a _",
    "_ b _ ) area ( see @xcite ) , while the faint sample is the result of several mefos pointings which are complete down to @xmath55 only over the central _ region a _ , but are only locally complete over the remaining _",
    "region b_. each random catalogue was generated 1000 times .",
    "the results from these three methods agree to within the nominal uncertainties obtained from poisson statistics .",
    "the data set was divided into several luminosity , redshift and spatial sub - samples in order to study the autocorrelation function @xmath56 and the integral autocorrelation function @xmath57 as a function of the comoving distance , and the correlation length @xmath58 assuming a fixed value of @xmath59 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 . in figure 1_a",
    "_ we show the autocorrelation function @xmath56 in the range @xmath43 for the total data set of 388 quasars .",
    "one sigma poisson errors in the figure are based on the number of observed pairs in each bin .",
    "the average redshift is 1.34 .",
    "with the slope fixed to @xmath60 it results @xmath61 @xmath6 mpc and @xmath62 , in agreement with estimate of croom and shanks ( 1996 ) of @xmath63 ( their table 1 ) .    in order to examine the evolution in the amplitude of the correlation function ,",
    "the sample was split into the two redshift ranges @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , with average redshift of 0.97 and 1.82 respectively .",
    "the resulting @xmath56 are shown in figure 1_b_. these were fitted by @xmath59 power laws with @xmath58 as a free parameter . at low redshift @xmath66 @xmath6 mpc was found , corresponding to @xmath67 ; while at high redshift @xmath68 @xmath6 mpc , which corresponds to @xmath69 , a @xmath70 significant discrepancy .",
    "the number of observed pairs with @xmath71 @xmath6 mpc in the range @xmath64 is 22 against 17.5 pairs expected . in the redshift range @xmath65 ,",
    "26 pairs are observed against 11.3 expected .    in order to check the reliability of this result the same kind of analysis",
    "was applied in the central complete _ region a _ of our data set , using random samples generated by the three methods described above with the addition of a random generation of @xmath49 and @xmath50 coordinates . in the low redshift subsample , containing 99 quasars , it turns out @xmath72 , while in the high redshift subsample , containing 77 quasars @xmath73 .",

    "for this reason we have used the _ friend of friend _ technique to look for groups containing quasars having at least another quasar at a distance less than 15 @xmath6 mpc .",
    "the technique consists of drawing a sphere of radius @xmath34 around each quasar .",
    "if there are other friends within this sphere they are considered to belong to the same group .",
    "the same procedure is applied to the friends until no more friends are found ( see komberg , kravtov and lukash 1996 for details about the method ) . at redshift less than 1.4",
    "there are four groups of three members each , while at redshift higher than 1.4 there are four groups of three members and one of four members .",
    "the four member group is responsible for only 3 of the total 26 observed pairs at distance less 15 @xmath6 mpc at high redshift , while 11.3 are randomly expected .",
    "we can , thus , conclude that the result is not contaminated by the presence in the sample of a rare large group of quasars at @xmath22 .",
    "we have also investigated possible biases due to selection effects in the sample as a function of redshift .",
    "being a flux limited sample , the high redshift sample selects preferentially brighter quasars .",
    "natural bias predicts that the amplitude of the autocorrelation function would increase with galaxy brightness .",
    "the high redshift sample has an average absolute magnitude of @xmath123 , while the low redshift one has @xmath124 . in order to disentangle the magnitude dependence we have computed @xmath125 for the two subsamples with absolute magnitude in the range @xmath126 . in this case the average absolute magnitude for the high redshift sample is @xmath127 with @xmath128 , while for the low redshift sample is @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "also in this case the two subsamples show an increase of the clustering amplitude with redshift , showing that there is no significant dependence of the quasar clustering on the absolute magnitude .",
    "our clustering result has been compared with the clustering computed from other complete quasar surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we excluded the fields included in the sgp from the durham / aat survey of boyle et al .",

    "these samples show no significant evolution in comoving coordinates .",
    "however , by adding our new sample to these data ( a total data - set of 737 qsos ) the statistical significancy on the increase of the quasar clustering evolution with redshift is reduced .",
    "the resulting @xmath56 are shown in figure 1_c_. at low redshift we find @xmath131 ( @xmath132 @xmath6 mpc ) , while at high redshift @xmath133 ( @xmath134 @xmath6 mpc ) .",

    "we compare our result with previous analyses of the quasar clustering at low and high redshift .",
    "@xcite obtained clustering statistics for low redshift ( @xmath138 ) quasars in the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) . below 10 @xmath6 mpc four quasar pairs are observed compared with the prediction of 2.37 pairs ( @xmath139 .",

    "these analyses , although uncertainties on the clustering of this high redshift sample are very large , strengthen the evidence for an increase of the quasars clustering amplitude with redshift and are in agreement with the @xmath161 evolution law within a 1@xmath9 confidence level .",
    "studies of the x - ray background ( xrb ) residual fluctuations and their autocorrelation function ( acf ) have been used to constrain the counts , evolution and clustering properties of the extragalactic x - ray sources , in particular quasars .",
    "higher values of @xmath58 and lower values of @xmath30 determine a larger contribution of quasars to the soft xrb fluctuations , with the possible result of exceeding the limits on the xrb acf and spectral shape .",
    "the general consensus ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) is that a population of sources , clustered like quasars , can not produce more than @xmath162 - @xmath163 of the still unresolved xrb .",
    "soltan and hasinger 1994 show ( their figure 8) that if quasars contribute 100% of the total xrb they would require a correlation length of 1.5 - 2 @xmath6 mpc at @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "if instead a quasar contribution of 35% is assumed , a correlation length of 4.5 - 6 @xmath6 mpc is allowed .",
    "a recent analysis of deep rosat fields ( @xcite ) has shown that quasars ( i.e. broad emission line agns ) unlikely contribute to more than 40 per cent ( but at least 30% ) of the total xrb at 1 kev . in the framework of this result",
    ", our outcomes agree with the limits estimated by @xcite . indeed , from danese et al .",
    "( 1993 , their figure 3 ) , it is possible to see that our estimate of @xmath166 @xmath6 mpc and @xmath167 allows a contribution of more than 15% for fluxes fainter than @xmath168 erg @xmath169 s@xmath41 in the 0.9 - 2.4 kev band . at these fluxes quasars contribute already at @xmath170 of the total xrb ( see @xcite their figure 7 ) and this corresponds to an allowed contribution of quasars to the total xrb of more than 45% , in agreement with the limits imposed by mchardy et al .",
    "an increase of the clustering amplitude with redshift is a powerful diagnostic for models of quasar formation and evolution .",
    "schematic patterns of the type `` continuous - activity '' , in which each agn undergoes a long , continuous dimming after a short formation phase at @xmath171 , and `` recurrent - activity '' , in which the potential - agn population shows intermittent episodes of brightening lasting a relatively short time , can not be easily reconciled with the present observations .",
    "if the same population of mass condensations , formed at a given redshift , is permanently or recurrently shining as quasars , then in any hierarchical clustering scenario an increase of the clustering with decreasing redshift would be expected . on the other hand",
    ", the quasar phenomenon may represent a single , short event ( @xmath172 yr ) in the host galaxy lifetime .",
    "if we associate it with a characteristic mass at all epochs , i.e. a sparse sampling of the distribution of halos with mass greater than @xmath173 , quasars would correspond to rarer and rarer over - densities with increasing redshift and their clustering amplitude is expected to grow with @xmath20 .",
    "this scenario is described as the _ transient model _ by @xcite .    in a more quantitative way we can follow matarrese et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in estimating the observed correlation function in a given redshift interval in the framework of an @xmath174 cdm model .",
    "this is carried out by suitably weighting the mass autocorrelation function @xmath175 with the number of objects as a function of redshift and convolving with the effective bias factor @xmath176 .",
    "the effective bias @xmath177 is the weighted mean of the bias @xmath178 with the mass distribution ( e.g. press - schecter ) at a given redshift .",
    "figure 2 shows that for a minimum halo mass in the range @xmath179 , the qso two - point correlation function is reproduced both in absolute value and redshift evolution .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite , on the basis of the shape and evolution of the qso luminosity function , suggest that the quasar phenomenon at @xmath180 is connected with interactions in relatively small galaxy groups , whose typical mass , @xmath181 , is remarkably similar to our estimate , based on the clustering properties .    what is the relation between the possible observed increase of the quasar clustering with redshift , the recent evidence of a decrease of the galaxy clustering with redshift with @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the theories of formation and evolution of cosmic structure ?",
    "we can schematically envisage that either galaxies form via the merging of lower - mass halos or they form at some characteristic redshift ( the _ merging _ and _ object - conserving _ models of matarrese et al .",
    "1997 , respectively ) . in this framework",
    "the non - linear processes leading to the galaxy formation give origin to a bias parameter with a distinctive evolution .",
    "the convolution of the bias @xmath178 with the mass autocorrelation function @xmath175 and the galaxy redshift distribution can produce the observed decrease of the galaxy clustering with increasing redshift .",
    "it must be pointed out , however , that different population of galaxies may show different clustering properties and there are indications that for high-@xmath20 star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) the clustering amplitude does not decrease so quickly as for faint low-@xmath20 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "another ( not necessarily alternative ) scenario , which can explain the qso clustering behaviour , is based on a change of the morphological mix of the quasar host galaxies with redshift .",
    "recently @xcite have proposed , on the basis of the metallicities and abundance ratios in absorption - line systems associated with quasars , that the host galaxies at high redshift are early - type bulge dominated , formed quickly through a huge episode of star formation .",
    "this picture is reinforced by the observed increase with redshift of the dust mass associated with quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , low-@xmath20 quasars may be related to the accretion onto black holes in the nuclei of late - type galaxies , where gas is still available . at low redshift early - type galaxies",
    "are observed to cluster more strongly than late type galaxies ( @xcite ) by a factor @xmath182 . if this behaviour persists at all redshifts , an increase of the fraction of elliptical galaxies as quasar hosts could produce the increase of the quasar correlation at high redshifts .",
