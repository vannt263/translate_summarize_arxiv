    "high - field noise in degenerate conductors still lacks a systematic theoretical description , despite its importance for microelectronics .",
    "@xcite here we advance a practicable theory of nonequilibrium fluctuations in metallic systems , accounting for the dominant fermi - liquid behaviour of the electrons .",
    "@xcite there is no electronic property of a metal near equilibrium that is not governed by pauli exclusion , from the microscopic level to the bulk .",
    "@xcite in this paper we analyse how degeneracy determines nonequilibrium current noise over a wide range of length scales , even at high fields .    technological developments of late have led to a variety of delicate measurements of transport and noise in many different mesostructures .",
    "@xcite alongside the experiments there has been much theoretical activity .",
    "@xcite a particular topic , still being elaborated , is the behaviour of current fluctuations in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "these are typically shorter than the inelastic mean free path but longer than that for elastic processes .",
    "they are in the regime of diffusive transport , where two diverse understandings predominate .",
    "one technique is the quantum - transmission ( landauer ) method @xcite as applied to fluctuations by lesovik , @xcite beenakker and bttiker , @xcite martin and landauer , @xcite and many others .",
    "@xcite the second approach is the semiclassical - transport ( boltzmann ) method @xcite associated with nagaev @xcite and de jong and beenakker .",
    "@xcite both view a mesoscopic wire as an assembly of individual elastic scatterers in a bath of free carriers .",
    "the formalisms , however , are quite dissimilar .",
    "@xcite    in the landauer model , multiple scattering preserves the coherence of single - particle propagation ; the only way in which current fluctuations can lose correlation strength is by interplay of the transmission amplitudes and nonlocal pauli blocking between state occupancies in the source and drain leads .",
    "@xcite in the boltzmann model , incoherence enters from the start through the stosszahlansatz . to study the fluctuations ,",
    "the stochastic collision term is supplemented with a set of langevin flux sources whose phenomenology is that of classical shot noise ; @xcite their self - correlations reflect the sporadic timing of elementary encounters between discrete wave packets and scatterers .",
    "the induced fluctuations lose correlation strength when diffusive elastic scattering is locally modified by pauli exclusion .",
    "@xcite    regardless of their differences , both methods can explain observations such as the threefold suppression of shot noise when elastic scattering prevails .",
    "@xcite because the phase - coherent model is fully quantum mechanical , its fluctuation structure is natural , not imposed , and its predictions enjoy a definitive status . on the other hand , semiclassical phenomenology is the more natural tool when inelastic ( hence irreducibly phase - breaking ) collisions are important , as in high - field transport .",
    "our paper investigates fluctuations beyond the elastic weak - field limit . a mesoscopic sample",
    "is easily driven into the high - field regime ; some tens of millivolts across a length of 100 nm will do it .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , although nonequilibrium noise is a unique source of dynamical information out of reach to linear - response theory , @xcite none of the existing models has been pushed substantially beyond its low - field perturbative regime .",
    "the landauer and boltzmann - langevin formalisms each suffers from its own obstacles to addressing strongly nonequilibrium effects , as does the quantum - kinetic theory of altshuler , levitov , and yakovets , @xcite which tries to unify them .",
    "there is , therefore , a real need for another approach : one that is nonperturbative in the driving field .",
    "this need has been reasserted very recently by numerical evidence of a rich structure for shot noise at high fields , even in nondegenerate systems .",
    "@xcite    we propose a direct and versatile method for treating noise semiclassically from equilibrium up to high fields , building on fermi - liquid theory @xcite and a family of green functions for the linearised transport equation .",
    "such functions have been studied by kogan and shulman , @xcite gantsevich , gurevich , and katilius , @xcite and by stanton and wilkins , in great detail , for semiconductors .",
    "@xcite unlike boltzmann - langevin , this approach is not limited to the specifically boltzmannian form of the collision integral .",
    "@xcite for every collisional approximation that can be used in the one - particle transport equation , there is a systematic construction for the two - particle boltzmann - green functions ( bgfs ) .",
    "these then generate both the steady - state and transient nonequilibrium fluctuations , respecting the conservation laws as well as the one - body collisional structure and bringing great flexibility to noise calculations .",
    "an application to the noise perfomance of heterojunction transistors is given by green and chivers.@xcite    in section ii we present a general framework for noise in small metallic systems , including coulomb effects @xcite where we identify two distinct mechanisms for screening .",
    "iii contains the major applications of our theory .",
    "first , we extend the fluctuation - dissipation relation for thermally driven noise to nonequilibrium conductors , @xcite highlighting the role of pauli exclusion in suppressing hot - electron effects in the bulk noise spectrum . @xcite we then discuss the many - body origin of shot noise and argue that , in their sharply contrasting responses to coulomb screening , shot noise and thermal noise display quite different physics .",
    "we propose a simple experimental test of this difference . in sec .",
    "iv we make an exact computation of shot noise within the drude picture of a conducting wire .",
    "we include the effects of finite wire thickness on carrier motion , a significant source of shot - noise suppression at high currents that is unrelated to diffusive elastic scattering and to coulomb screening .",
    "we sum up in sec .",
    "the theoretical discussion is in four parts .",
    "we begin by formulating the transport problem as a direct mapping of the electron fermi liquid to its nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "second , we describe the steady - state fluctuations .",

    "for both strips and cylinders in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , it is the behaviour of @xmath326 at higher values of @xmath282 that comes to notice first : each curve merges with its asymptotic 1d analogue illustrated in fig . [ fig2](b ) .",
    "as will shortly become clear , it is only in the thick - wire limit , and _ then _ only for high currents , that a 1d treatment can in any sense mimic the exact calculations for higher dimensions [ those conditions amount to setting @xmath327 within eq .",
    "( [ apx - ish13 ] ) ] .",
    "in fact , as one progresses from 1d through 3d [ figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , [ fig3](a ) , and [ fig3](b ) ] , the zero - current intercepts of the curves indexed by the same @xmath325 undergo a marked and systematic increase in suppression .",
    "this shows ( at least in the simple drude model ) that the 1d calculation is a poor estimate of low - field noise in realistic geometries , even in the thick - wire limit .",
    "we come to the thin wires of fig .",

    "however , relative to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the remaining curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] change dramatically as one moves further from the ballistic limit .",
    "there is now substantial shot - noise suppression throughout the whole range of @xmath282 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) the longest 3d wire , @xmath294 , has @xmath328 at the highest current @xmath329 , while its opposite number in fig . [",
    "fig4](b ) reaches the value 0.2 ; a threefold reduction .",
    "calculations at much higher fields confirm the eventual recovery of full shot noise in keeping with eq .",
    "( [ apx - ish7 ] ) .",
    "the outcome of spatially constrained carrier motion is the extensive suppression of shot noise over a wide range of the current .",
    "we stress that the effect is implicit in the generic structure of the boltzmann equation , and its propagators , for 2d and 3d [ see eq .",
    "( [ apxsn6 ] ) ] ; it is simply absent in 1d .",
    "therefore , this mode of suppression can not be simulated by any one - dimensional scheme .    in a 3d wire",
    "the fermi wavelength is 0.05 nm at metallic electron densities . if @xmath330 , typical for strong inelastic scattering , a wire of width @xmath331 would exhibit kinematic shot - noise suppression at large currents , providing that it was not masked by collisional coulomb effects . in future",
    "we plan to assess the latter quantitatively ; the comparative action of nonequilibrium screening , in 2d versus 3d , should itself be an interesting window on how dimensionality affects fluctuations .",
    "we have described and implemented a nonperturbative microscopic formalism for current fluctuations in metallic systems , down to the mesoscopic scale , within the ambit of semiclassical theory .",
    "our strategy for incorporating fermion correlations into the boltzmann picture safeguards the conservation laws at both the single - particle level and at the level of dynamic two - particle processes , the key to nonequilibrium current noise .",
    "in particular we have derived the nonlinear analogue of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "it should also be straightforward to include semiclassical electron - electron scattering in our description of transport and noise .",
    "our formalism s calculability stems from the flexible structure of the boltzmann - green functions .",
    "these serve as semiclassical propagators of the electronic fermi - liquid correlations , mapping them uniquely to the correlations of the nonequilibrium system .",
    "we have demonstrated their usefulness in shedding light on the physics of high - current shot noise , and on the importance of treating dimensionality correctly in constricted mesoscopic samples .",
    "the present account of nonequilibrium fluctuations raises a variety of interesting questions , practical and abstract . by far",
    "the most salient is the relation between thermal noise and shot noise ; our claim that the two are thermodynamically incommensurate should be easy to test .",
    "thermal - noise measurements on a gated two - dimensional mesoscopic wire , defined on a iii - v heterojunction , ought to give a strong gate - voltage - dependent signature of thomas - fermi suppression from self - confinement of the carriers in their quantum well .",
    "measurements of the shot noise in the same structure should give no such signature .",
    "we end with just two out of many theoretical issues .",
    "the first is the role of non - analyticity of the bgf solutions at low fields , and the implications for semiclassical linear response . the phenomenon is well known in uniform systems , @xcite where the free - streaming part of the boltzmann operator is manifestly anomalous in its vanishing with the applied field . while we have no firm information on whether the bte for nonuniform systems shares this behaviour , we point out that our shot - noise results , obtained in a spatially inhomogeneous model ( albeit weakly so ) , are certainly non - analytic in the applied voltage .",
    "the low - field asymptotics of the general boltzmann equation have an obvious bearing on how semiclassical noise is to be calculated , and their clarification would be a significant advance .",
    "second , there is the status of the bgf approach within quantum kinetics . in terms of , say , the kadanoff - baym analysis of the boltzmann equation , @xcite our semiclassical equation of motion",
    "for the fluctuations should emerge from the quantum evolution of the particle - hole amplitudes in the long - wavelength limit , @xcite much as the ordinary bte is distilled from the long - wavelength dynamics of the density matrix for a single particle .",

    "we end with thomas - fermi screening , which influences thermal noise alone . keeping in mind the high - field application , we base our calculations on the collision time model ( see the following appendices ) .",
    "our results are specific to a bulk system with inelastic scattering ; we stress both their illustrative intent and their inapplicability to the elastic diffusive regime , where the boltzmann propagators and the collisional screening effects are very different .",
