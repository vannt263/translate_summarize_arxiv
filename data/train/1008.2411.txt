    "the absorption and scattering of particles outside a black hole has been a topic of research since 1970s .",
    "this issue refers to many key theoretical physics problems , such as quantum entanglement@xcite , entropy@xcite , information @xcite which arise in black hole physics and quantum gravity where fundamental issues about gravity physics and the structure of space are of interest . after hawking @xcite",
    "proved black hole can emit thermal radiation via quantum field theory , the absorption and scattering issue is focused gradually in black hole physics .",
    "many people , such as unruh @xcite , s@xmath6nchez@xcite , das @xcite , emparan@xcite etc . , have done a lot of works on the black hole scattering in the aspects of calculation of absorption greybody factor and cross section as well as black hole s based properties such as unitarity and reciprocity @xcite , phase shifts and diffraction pattern @xcite , angular distribution @xcite , extra dimensional effect @xcite and so on .",
    "what this paper @xcite refers to is the unruh s work in which the original analytical method to calculating black hole cross section is shown in detail in 1976 .",
    "the radiation equation , i.e. regge - wheeler equation in perturbation theory , is broken down into three sub - equations in following three regions : one is near the horizon , one is intermediate region and the last is far from the black hole .",
    "then these sub - equations can be solved easily by means of well - known functions or specific functions .",
    "finally , the absorption coefficients are obtained by matching these solutions in the areas of overlap between the regions .",
    "it is found that the absorption cross section of dirac particles is exactly 1/8 of the massive scalar particles .",
    "the total cross section of massive scalar field is a function of ingoing particles frequency .",
    "scalar cross section @xmath7 and transmission coefficients @xmath8 @xcite are @xmath9\\ } } , \\label{crosec}\\\\    ( t_s)_l & = & \\frac{\\pi l!^4 2^{2l+2}\\omega ( 1+v^2 ) \\omega^{2l+2 } v^{2l}}{(2l)!^4 ( 2l+1)^2\\{1 - \\exp\\left[-\\pi \\omega ( 1+v^2)/v\\right]\\ } } \\prod_{s=1}^{l}\\left[s^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega ( 1 + v^2)}{2v}\\right)^2\\right ] , \\label{trancoe1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the velocity of particle , @xmath11 is the angular quantum number , @xmath12 is the mass , @xmath13 is the energy .",
    "since then , this analytical method has become a standard procedure to calculate absorption cross section .",
    "meanwhile , there is also the others method to obtain the cross section , for example in 1978 an algebraic method , i.e. power - series approximate expansion , is improved by sanchezv @xcite in schwarzschild space .",
    "additionally , anderson developed a phase - integral method @xcite in 1995 .",
    "on the aspect of modeling methodology , a wide variety of scattering models have been proposed including fermion emission @xcite , charged leptons@xcite , elastic scattering@xcite , neutrinos@xcite , d - brane spectroscopy@xcite and so on .",
    "attentively , in 1997 , das , gibbons and mathur @xcite calculated the low energy absorption cross section of massless scalars and spin 1/2 particles which immerses a general asymptotically flat black hole with arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the former cross section is equal to the area of the black hole and the latter one is related to the area of true metric . unlike this work ,",
    "a non - asymptotically flat de sitter universe is considered here .    recently , more and more attentions paid to high dimensional black hole such as high dimensional schwarzschild - like black hole with analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite methods , high dimensional rotating kerr - like black holes @xcite , high dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter - like black hole @xcite and so on .",
    "specially , in the last work @xcite the absorption and scattering of multi - horizons space was first derived with analytical and numerical techniques by kanti , grain and barrau in the view of high dimensions.rsel , sandberg , novikov , and starobinsky with charged reissner nordstr@xmath14 m black hole @xcite . ]",
    "it is shown that hawking radiation can reveal much valuable information such as the space dimensionality , the space curvature , the bulk cosmological constant . here",
    ", we also consider a multi - horizons space but in the view of usual 4 dimensions by the similar method in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , the accelerating expanded universe is justified by more and more astronomical observations such as ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) .",
    "the expanded universe shows us a nonzero cosmological constant @xmath2 @xcite and the topology structure presents a de sitter one . like the standard null cosmological constant gravity ,",
    "a lot of literatures focuses on hawking radiation in an inflationary universe including two - dimensional toy models @xcite , radiative tails @xcite , degenerate special nariai black hole @xcite and so on . in these works ,",
    "brady , chambers , krivan and laguna @xcite demonstrated the existence of exponentially decaying tails at late times outside sds and reissner nordstr@xmath14m - de sitter ( rnds ) black holes where the s wave mode asymptotes to a nonzero value . in this work , an advanced time @xmath15 and a retarded time @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the tortoise coordinate is used .",
    "however , there is no work given out the explicit expressions of analytic absorption probability with cosmological constant as far as we know .",
    "the reason maybe is the complex ordinary differential equation which could not be solved completely and do not give us the general solution .",
    "considering these situations , we adopt the approximate treatment with low - energy and high - energy limits assumptions and attempt to calculate the absorption and scattering cross sections or greybody factors outside sds black hole .",
    "so the whole problem is divided into two parts : low - energy regime and high - energy regime . in the former case ,",
    "the similar unruh s @xcite method is used .",
    "but we will only use two zones , i.e. near event horizon and cosmological horizon respectively , and match the solution in the intermediate zones . in the latter high - energy case",
    ", we use the innermost stable circular orbit to fitting the high energy particles and try to obtain the greybody factor .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to inspect whether the cosmological constant can influence the cross section of usual schwarzschild black hole .",
    "finally , we want to clarify two points : one is the units of cosmological constant @xmath2 and the other is the polarization of absorption cross section in black hole . for the former case , we use the planck units ( g = c=@xmath18=1 ) to specify @xmath2 in this paper . in this units",
    ", @xmath2 has dimensionless form . also , in order to simplify the calculation of graybody factor , the mass of black hole @xmath1 is adopted to unity in this manuscript . hence ,",
    "if we convert cosmological constant @xmath2 to ordinary units , we can multiply it quantificationally by its conversion factor via @xmath19 .",
    "so in the ordinary units , @xmath2 has a dimension of @xmath20 .",
    "about these specific details , please see the refs.@xcite .",
    "for the latter polarization case , incoming scalar particles have no polarization .",
    "in fact , the polarization exists in the scattered - out beam for the charged particles outside a black hole , despite the incoming beam is not polarized . to take reissner - nordstr@xmath14 m black hole for an example , since the effect of absorption , the non - zero scattering amplitude provides a polarization effect .",
    "hence , the scattered - out beam is polarized , and the polarization vector is perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the polarization grade is the function of azimuth angle . about these specific details ,",
    "please see the refs.@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole solution and obtain the general emission equation . in section iii , we calculate absorption probabilities for scalar particles emission in low - energy regime . in section iv , we use the geometric optics limit and calculate the greybody factor of scalar particles emission in high - energy regime .",
    "section v is a conclusion .",
    "we adopt the signature @xmath21 and put @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 equal to unity .",
    "the static spherically symmetric metric of the schwarzschild - de sitter space @xcite is @xmath24 which is obtained via solving the einstein gravity field equations coupling with cosmological constant @xmath2 , @xmath25 the central black - hole mass @xmath1 is contained in metric function @xmath26 . in this paper ,",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath2 is considered as a free parameter as shown in refs .",
    "the interesting features for the space metric ( [ metric ] ) are its two bounded horizons , one is inner horizon ( i.e. black - hole horizon ) and the other is outer horizon ( i.e. cosmological horizon ) . under the limit @xmath27",
    ", this metric has exactly the same line - element as the schwarzschild space .",
    "but in the limit of @xmath28 , it reduces to the de sitter one . by using these horizons ,",
    "the metric function can be rewritten mathematically as a new form , @xmath29 the singularity of metric ( [ metric ] ) is determined by equation @xmath30 , which is also the null hypersurface condition for static spherically symmetric space .",
    "so , these solutions are inner horizon @xmath31 and outer horizon @xmath32 , as well as a negative solution @xmath33 .",
    "the last one has no physical aspects , and is not considered here .",
    "the former two positive solutions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are listed as follows , @xmath36 where @xmath37\\right)$ ] .",
    "the real physical solutions are accepted only if @xmath2 satisfies @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "if the cosmological constant @xmath2 reaches its maximum , the nariai black - hole will appear , which has attracted a lot of academic attentions @xcite .",
    "here we plot the curves of event horizon @xmath34 and cosmological horizon @xmath35 in fig.[horizons ] , which show clearly that the outer cosmological horizon @xmath35 decreases with increase in cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "else , @xmath35 decreases exponentially quickly when @xmath2 is under the order of @xmath39 . and",
    "the amplitude of variation for @xmath35 is relative slower when @xmath2 is larger than @xmath39 .",
    "but the inner event horizon @xmath34 gently increases oppositely with increase in @xmath2 . on the other hand , it is known that our world is located between event horizon and cosmological horizon .",
    "so we also plot the interval @xmath40 versus cosmological constant @xmath2 in the same fig.[horizons ] .",
    "it illustrates that with the increasing @xmath2 , the interval range decreases monotonically .",
    "else , the rate of decreasing is very large both in the primary stage and the terminal stage of dynamic cosmological constant .",
    "( dashed line ) , cosmological horizon @xmath35 ( dotted line ) and interval @xmath40 ( solid line ) versus cosmological constant @xmath2 in the range of @xmath41 $ ] for @xmath42.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    employing the factorized ansatz @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the spherical harmonics function , the minimal coupling massless scalar field @xmath45 equation @xmath46 is broken into spherical harmonic equation ( she ) and the radial radiation equation ( rre ) .",
    "the former she is one of the main characteristic for sphere - symmetric space , and is not shown here .",
    "the latter rre contains much of the information for hawking radiation , which is shown as , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the time - dependent radial function .",
    "radial radiation eq.([radius - t - equation ] ) is the propagated master equation ( [ radius - t - equation ] ) , which determines the evolution of evaporating black - hole for scalar particles .",
    "eliminated the time variable by the fourier component @xmath49 via @xmath50 , eq.([radius - t - equation ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath51\\psi_{\\omega   l}(r)=\\omega^2\\psi_{\\omega l}(r),\\label{radius equ . about r}\\ ] ] whose dominion potential is given by@xmath52.\\label{potential - of - r}\\ ] ] here in order to inspect the influences of angular momentum and cosmological constant on this potential , we plot figs.[potential ] and [ potential2 ] respectively . from these figures ,",
    "we can see easily that the potential @xmath53 depends on parameters @xmath2 and @xmath11 sensitively .",
    "it is illustrated that potential @xmath53 is higher with increase for the angular momentum quantum number @xmath11 from fig.[potential ] , and it also suggests that for the spherically symmetric s wave , i.e. @xmath54 , its absorption capacity is the strongest than the others .",
    "so , the dominant s wave is only considered in this paper . but viewing from fig.[potential2 ] the potential becomes lower with increase in cosmological constant .     and",
    "angular momentum @xmath55 ( p wave).[potential2 ] ]     and angular momentum @xmath55 ( p wave).[potential2 ] ]    now we introduce the tortoise coordinate@xmath56 the tortoise coordinate can be expressed by surface gravity as follows , @xmath57},\\ ] ] where the definition of surface gravity is @xmath58 . using three solutions @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath59 to equation @xmath60",
    ", we can obtain following explicit expressions of corresponding three surface gravities as , @xmath61 through tortoise coordinate transformation ( [ tortoise ] ) , the radial equation ( [ radius equ . about r ] ) can be written in the regge - wheeler form @xmath62\\psi_{\\omega l}(r_{*})=4m^2\\omega^2\\psi_{\\omega l}(r_{*}),\\label{radius - equation}\\ ] ] which has the form of schr@xmath14dinger equation in the quantum mechanics .",
    "the incoming or outgoing particles flowing between inner horizon @xmath31 and outer horizon @xmath32 are reflected or transmitted by the potential barrier @xmath53 .",
    "it is obvious that the evolution of wave solution @xmath63 of massless scalar field is also determined by potential @xmath53 .",
    "in the above calculation , the radial @xmath64 is absorbed into wave function @xmath65 to get the regge - wheeler equation .",
    "but in this and next section we need do a reduction run , i.e. using replacement @xmath66 .",
    "so the original radial radiation eq.([radius equ . about r",
    "] ) can be rewritten to a new form @xmath67 p_{\\omega l } ( r ) = 0.\\ ] ] it is well known that , in the low - energy regime @xmath68 , only the lowest angular momentum will contribute to the cross section @xcite .",
    "so , in this paper we consider the dominant scalar decay mode s wave ( @xmath54 ) , which also is illustrated clearly in fig.[potential ] .",
    "the analytical solution can be obtained as follows , @xmath69 using the surface gravities to express above solution , we can get @xmath70 then we analyse the dynamic behavior of scalar particles propagation near horizons . according to the forenamed definition of horizons , we know that one feature of a static spherically symmetric space is that the potential vanishes near horizons @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so we have the relationship @xmath71 in the nearby regions of horizons @xmath34 and @xmath35 outside sds black hole immediately .",
    "hence , the regge - wheeler equation ( [ radius - equation ] ) can be transformed into a standard wave equation form , @xmath72\\psi_{\\omega l}(r_{*})= 0.\\ ] ]    the general boundary condition of greybody factor is that , near the black hole event horizon the solution is purely ingoing and near the cosmological horizon the solutions are include incoming and outgoing modes , @xmath73 so near the event horizon @xmath35 , the asymptotic solution ( [ bceh ] ) yields a low - energy expansion , @xmath74\\bigg{\\}}.\\ ] ] submitting @xmath75 into solution @xmath76 ( [ analytisur ] ) , we can get the general solution near event horizon , @xmath77.\\ ] ] comparing eq.([leeeh2 ] ) with eq.([leeeh ] ) , we can get the expressions of coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 near event horizon , @xmath80 so near the cosmological horizon , the low - energy expansion of the asymptotic solution ( [ bcch ] ) is obtained by using the similar handler routine , @xmath81.\\ ] ] similarly , submitting @xmath82 into solution @xmath76 ( [ analytisur ] ) , we can get the general solution near cosmological horizon , @xmath83.\\ ] ] hence , comparing eq.([gsnc ] ) with eq.([leeeeee ] ) we obtain the expressions of coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 near cosmological horizon , @xmath84 using the solutions near event horizon and cosmological horizon , we then stretch and match them in the intermediate region and obtain the key absorption coefficients .",
    "distinctly , the final relationship of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 can be obtained according to eqs.([c1eh]),([c1ch]),([c2eh]),([c2ch ] ) , @xmath88 the corresponding reflection and absorption probabilities are given naturally as follows , @xmath89 this result is in accordance with that of two - horizon spacetimes @xcite . here",
    "we present the solution in alternative method . in order to get the variation of absorption probability with cosmological constant , we use expression eq.([twohorizons ] ) to replace @xmath32 and @xmath31 in above eq.([absorption ] ) .",
    "finally , the analytic expression of absorption probability is obtained as follows @xmath90 , @xmath91 are defined by @xmath92 , @xmath93 respectively .",
    "one interesting fact of low energy regime is that this kind of scattering problem varies only with the whole value of @xmath0 which has a dimension of @xmath94 coincided with the reciprocal quantity of newton gravity constant .     versus cosmological constant @xmath2 for unit mass @xmath42 in low - energy regime.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    the form of the absorption probabilities for low - energy regime",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "it illustrates that absorption probabilities @xmath95 increases monotonically with cosmological constant .",
    "the maximum cosmological constant 0.11 is corresponding maximum probability @xmath96 .",
    "this point also matches the potential @xmath53 very well ( please see fig .",
    "[ potential2 ] ) .",
    "because that potential becomes lower with increasing cosmological constant , the action of lowering potential on the particles is weak and the absorption probabilities are naturally larger . on the other hand , it is shown that the absorption probability is vanished when cosmological constant disappears .",
    "this point is also justified by papers @xcite . referring to the cross section @xmath7 ( [ crosec ] ) and transmission coefficients @xmath8 ( [ trancoe1 ] ) in 4d schwarzschild space",
    ", we can see that when the particles mass is zero and the energy @xmath13 is more less than the mass of black hole @xmath97 , the cross section reduces to @xmath98 .",
    "this result shows that , in the low - energy regime the absorption cross section matches accurately with the area of schwarzschild black hole . this point is expanded to arbitrary dimensions by das et.al @xcite latterly . from the eqs .",
    "( [ crosec ] ) and ( [ trancoe1 ] ) , we can also see that the transmission coefficients @xmath8 vanish in the low - energy limit @xmath99 for all values of angular momentum @xmath11 including s wave , which justify the induction result of zero cosmological constant in sds black hole .",
    "unlike the singular horizon in schwarzschild space , there are two different horizons ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) in schwarzschild - de sitter space and the second horizon creates a finite universe .",
    "so for the low - energy particles , which has a infinite wavelength , can be localized and has a finite probability to traverse the finite distance between the two horizons @xcite .",
    "of high - energy particles with various cosmological constants and unit mass m = 1.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    when the particles propagate in the high - energy regime , the scalar greybody factor can be assumed its geometric optics limit value @xcite .",
    "the momentum of high - energy particle is @xmath100 , where @xmath91 is an arbitrary scalar parameter for the affine parameter .",
    "so the first and second motion equations about @xmath101 and @xmath102 are obtained naturally in the following equations , @xmath103 and the third motion equation can be given by the normalization relation of particles @xmath104 = 0 , @xmath105 then the high - energy particle is subjected eqs.([m1 ] ) , ( [ m2 ] ) and ( [ m3 ] ) near sds black hole .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) , the trajectory equation can be gotten as , @xmath106 here , we define two new parameters , one is the impact parameter @xmath107 , which means the effective sighting range , the other is the high - energy particle s effective potential @xmath108 , which is shown in fig.[hheps ] . the parameter @xmath109 is @xmath110 according to eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) , particles orbital equation ( [ trajectoryequation ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath111 which is also called binet equation in the subject of celestial bodies motion orbits .",
    "the classically accessible regime is @xmath112 , which means the closest orbit of high - energy particle before absorption by black hole .",
    "the absorption area of the black hole with high energies is @xmath113 which is shown in fig.[greybodyfactorhh ] . like the regime of low energy ,",
    "the greybody factor @xmath114 is also increasing monotonically with increase in cosmological constant @xmath2 in high - energy regime .",
    "when the cosmological constant vanishes , the above expression reduces to the schwarzschild case @xmath115 @xcite .     versus cosmological constant @xmath2 for unit mass @xmath42 in high - energy regime.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +",
    "in this paper , we have studied the scalar particles radiations outside of schwarzschild - de sitter black hole in low - energy regime and high - energy regime .",
    "finally , we have successfully obtained the analytic absorption probability @xmath95 in low - energy regime and the greybody factor @xmath116 in high - energy regime , respectively .",
    "we find the cosmological constant influences intensely the cross section and greybody not only in the low - energy zone but also in the high - energy zone .",
    "firstly , we have a look at the case of low - energy limit .",
    "it is well known that the cross section of schwarzschild black hole vanishes in the low - energy and low angular momentum limit @xcite .",
    "however , in the sds case the whole space is deformed due to the existence of cosmological constant that changes naturally the scatting of scalar field .",
    "for example , the improved potential @xmath53 ( [ potential - of - r ] ) , which is illustrated in figs.([potential ] ) , ( [ potential2 ] ) , decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "so the absorbent capacity , which expresses mathematically by absorption probabilities @xmath95 , enhances for a low potential @xmath117 .",
    "this point also explain essentially the tendency profile of fig.([fig1 ] ) , which shows absorption probabilities @xmath95 increases with increasing in cosmological constant .",
    "secondly , we make some discussions on the high - energy limit . due to the special physical characteristics of high - energy scalar particles , it is appropriate to assume the geometric optics limit value .",
    "likewise , the greybody factor @xmath114 also is under the influence of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the stronger absorption capacity for increase in cosmological constant @xmath2 determines the same monotonicity for the greybody factor @xmath116 in low - energy regime in fig.([greybodyfactorhh ] ) .",
    "the only difference between low - energy and high - energy regimes is that , for the large cosmological constant the @xmath114 increases more rapidly .",

    "<S> we study the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves propagating in spherically symmetric spacetimes with dynamical cosmological constant both in low - energy and high - energy zones . in the former low - energy regime , we solve analytically the regge - wheeler wave equation and obtain an analytic absorption probability expression which varies with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the central mass and @xmath2 is cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy absorption probability , which is in the range of @xmath3 $ ] , increases monotonically with increase in @xmath2 . in the latter high - energy regime , </S>",
    "<S> the scalar particles adopt their geometric optics limit value . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory equation with effective potential emerges and the analytic high - energy greybody factor , which is relevant with the area of classically accessible regime , also increases monotonically with increase in @xmath2 , as long @xmath2 is less than or of the order of @xmath4 . in this high - energy case </S>",
    "<S> , the null cosmological constant result reduces to the schwarzschild value @xmath5 . </S>"
