    "three principle observables drive the search for and characterization of cosmic ray sources : the energy spectrum , the nuclear composition , and the distribution of arrival directions .",
    "the cosmic ray energy spectrum encompasses a plummeting flux that drops from @xmath0 at @xmath1 to @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "its shape is remarkably featureless and can be described by a broken power law : the spectrum steepens gradually from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , then flattens to @xmath6 near @xmath7 forming a feature known as `` the ankle '' , and drops sharply at around @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the small variations of the spectral index can be interpreted either as a transition between cosmic ray populations , or as an imprint of cosmic ray propagation effects .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the ankle is that above @xmath9 a new population emerges which dominates the more steeply falling galactic population of heavy nuclei .",
    "the extragalactic component can be dominated either by protons  @xcite or heavies  @xcite .",
    "proton - dominance beyond the ankle is ultimately limited by the onset of photopion production on the cosmic microwave background , whereas dominance of a heavy composition is restricted by nucleus photodisintegration through the giant dipole resonance ",
    "the so called _ greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin _ ( gzk ) suppression at around @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it has also been advocated that the ankle feature could be well reproduced by a proton - dominated power - law spectrum , where the ankle is formed as a _ dip _ in the spectrum from the energy loss of protons via bethe - heitler pair production  @xcite . in this case",
    "extra - galactic protons would already have started to dominate the spectrum somewhat beyond @xmath11 .",
    "optical observations of air showers with fluorescence telescopes or non - imaging cherenkov detectors consistently find a predominantly light composition at around @xmath12  @xcite and the contribution of protons to the overall cosmic ray flux is @xmath13  50% in this energy range  @xcite . due the absence of a large anisotropy in the arrival direction of cosmic rays below the ankle  @xcite ,",
    "we can conclude that these protons must be of extra - galactic origin . at energies above @xmath14 ,",
    "the high - statistics data from the pierre auger observatory suggests a gradual increase of the fraction of heavy nuclei in the cosmic ray flux  @xcite . within uncertainties ,",
    "the data from the telescope array ( ta ) is consistent with these findings  @xcite .",

    "= @xmath17 )  the ta hot spot  @xcite .",
    "the absence of a concentration of nearby sources in this region of the sky favors a heavy nucleus hypothesis , whereby a few local sources within the gzk sphere can produce the hot spot through deflection in the galactic @xmath18-field .",
    "all in all , the apparent dominance of heavy nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath14 strongly argues against the interpretations of the ankle given above .",
    "one can ( of course ) accommodate the data with the addition of an _ ad hoc _ light extragalactic component below the ankle , with a steep injection spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , a more natural explanation of the entire spectrum and composition emerges while accounting for the `` post - processing '' of uhecrs through photodisintegration in the environment surrounding the source  @xcite . in such models",
    "relativistic nuclei accelerated by a central engine to extremely high energies remain trapped in the turbulent magnetic field of the source environment",
    ". their escape time decreases faster than the interaction time with increasing energy , so that only the highest energy nuclei can escape the source unscathed . in effect",
    ", the source environment acts as a high - pass filter on the spectrum of cosmic rays .",
    "all nuclei below the energy filter interact , scattering off the far - infrared photons in the source environment .",
    "these photonuclear interactions produce a steep spectrum of secondary nucleons , which is overtaken by the harder spectrum of the surviving nucleus fragments above about @xmath7 .",
    "these overlapping spectra could then carve an ankle - like feature into the source emission spectrum . the spectrum above the ankle exhibits a progressive transition to heavy nuclei , as the escape of non - interacting nuclei becomes efficient . in such models ,",
    "the source evolution with redshift plays a paramount role on the source parameters . for models with positive redshift evolution ( a greater number of sources per comoving volume at high redshift ) , both the imposition of a dominant light extragalactic component below the ankle and the source - ankle model favor a hard injection spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "however , it has been recently noted that fitting the high end of the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum and composition with negative source evolution allows for softer injection spectra  @xcite .    on a separate track ,",
    "it was recently pointed out that fermi - lat observations  @xcite severely constrain the distribution of uhecr sources  @xcite .",
    "this is because on the way to earth uhecrs interact with the radiation fields permeating the universe and give rise to energetic electron / positron pairs and photons , which in turn feed electromagnetic cascades resulting in a diffuse gamma - ray background radiation .",
    "the recent study in  @xcite suggests that a local `` fog '' of uhecrs accelerated in nearby sources must exist so as to not overproduce the cascade gamma - ray flux beyond fermi - lat observations .    in consideration of these new results",
    ", it seems interesting to explore whether remnants of dead quasars , which are distributed preferentially in the low - redshift universe , could accelerate heavy nuclei up to the highest observed energies .",
    "actually , nearby quasar remnants have long been suspected to be sources of uhecrs  @xcite .",
    "particle acceleration proceeds via the blandford - znajek mechanism , which wires dormant spinning black holes as faraday unipolar dynamos  @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling with reasonable assumptions on source parameters suggests that protons can be efficiently launched at @xmath20 .",
    "photopion production in collisions with ambient photons becomes a relatively important effect during the final phase of the acceleration process , and could damp the maximum attainable energy to values well below that imposed by the voltage drop .",
    "the large charge @xmath21 of heavy nuclei facilitates their acceleration to highest energy ( scaling linearly with @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , heavy nuclei could also interact with the ambient photons and may suffer significant spallation . in this paper",
    "we study in detail the dominant processes for nucleus energy losses , while searching for plausible source parameters which may allow acceleration of heavy nuclei up to the highest observed energies .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we provide an assessment of what is known observationally about the evolution of quasar activity and then discuss the general framework use to relate the quasar population with massive dark objects at the center of local inactive galaxies .",

    "the first extensive radio surveys of the 1950s revealed a new family of radio sources that , by the early 60s , had been associated with point - like optical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "these quasi - stellar radio sources , or quasars , revealed very large systemic redshifts indicating cosmological distances  @xcite .",
    "this implied luminosities up to hundreds of times that of the milky way , apparently emitted from very small size - scales  @xcite , suggesting an extremely energetic emission mechanism .",
    "it has now been established that quasars are ultimately powered by the accretion of matter onto the @xmath23 supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at cores of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "quasars and their relativistically - beamed counterparts , blazars , are the most luminous sub - class of _ active galactic nuclei _ ( agns ) , which is the general name for an actively - accreting smbh .",
    "in fact , these objects are the most luminous continuously - emitting objects in the universe .",
    "quasar luminosity is , to first order , constrained by the eddington limit  @xcite .",
    "this is the maximum luminosity of a spherically accreting object , determined by the point at which outward radiation pressure halts gravitational infall .",
    "the eddington limit is proportional to the mass of the accreting object . scaled for a quasar powered by a smbh of @xmath24 , this luminosity is : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the solar mass and @xmath27 is the bolometric luminosity of large galaxies like the milky way . note that accretion by the standard @xmath28-disk , which is typically assumed for quasars , is also eddington limited  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the number density of quasars peaked at redshift @xmath29 , when the universe was one - fifth of its present age  @xcite .",
    "locally , essentially all galaxies with spheroidal components contain a smbh  @xcite .",
    "the close relationships between the masses of these smbhs and their host galaxy s properties , including stellar velocity dispersion , spheroidal luminosity , and dynamical mass , indicates that the growth of smbhs and their hosts are closely tied  @xcite .",
    "these relationships also allow us to make a relatively direct determination of the local smbh mass function  @xcite .",
    "another approach to deriving the local smbh mass function is to integrate smbh accretion over cosmic time based on the evolving high-@xmath30 quasar luminosity function @xcite .",
    "such models are able to reproduce the `` observered '' low-@xmath30 mass function for quiescent smbhs very successfully by assuming the typical radiative efficiencies for an @xmath28-disk ( @xmath31 ) , and reasonable eddington fractions  quasar luminosities as a fraction of the eddington limit ( eddington fraction )  of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this general agreement supports for the idea that accretion in agn mode is an important , and perhaps the principle mechanism by which local smbhs grow  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that many of the more massive quiescent smbhs in the local universe are \" remnant  quasars  @xcite , and that these greatly outnumber active quasars in the modern epoch .    in their active phases , accreting smbhs are expected to support strong magnetic fields . assuming a rapidly - rotating black hole , which may be common in luminous quasars  @xcite , this magnetic field is expected to survive the expiration of the quasar phase .",
    "we calculate a typical relic magnetic field strength for a rapidly rotating smbh by assuming that it corresponds to maximum field strength acquired during its quasar phase .",
    "this in turn corresponds to its maximum accretion rate . to determine this accretion rate we assume the lower end of @xmath28-disk radiative efficiency , @xmath33 ( corresponding to a higher accretion rate per unit luminosity ) , and that the quasar radiates at the eddington limit .",
    "the mass accretion rate needed to sustain the eddington luminosity is @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the accreting plasma is assumed to support an axisymmetric magnetic field configuration due to the generation of currents . following  @xcite ,",
    "we get an estimate of the characteristic magnetic field strength @xmath36 by assuming pressure equilibrium between the magnetic field and the in - falling matter  @xcite @xmath37 this magnetic field may be taken as a fiducial strength for quasars remnants at the upper end of the local smbh mass and spin functions .",
    "this represents the magnetic field strength developed by a maximally rotating black hole at the peak of its accretion phase and at the upper end of the mass function . in the following calculations we work with this fiducial strength , yielding",
    "it will be seen that a relatively high field strength , @xmath38 , is necessary to achieve a significant flux of @xmath39 single - proton crs around a @xmath40 smbh .",
    "however , when we consider black holes up to @xmath41 , and heavy nuclei crs , the required field strength drops by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "we also assume that a significant fraction of the maximum field strength is sustained as accretion rate drops into the remnant quasar phase .",
    "further data on the spatial association of uhecrs with smbhs will test this assumption .",
    "significant magnetic fields do appear to survive in the case of least one class of remnant quasar .",
    "bl lacertae objects are agns of the blazar class  broadly , agns with jets that are closely aligned with our line of sight  @xcite .",
    "bl lacs show little or no signs of broad emission lines or thermal emission  @xcite .",
    "this implies that at least a subset of bl lacs are starved of gas , and perhaps in a post - quasar phase . under this interpretation , flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs )",
    "become the progenitor population of low - accretion bl lacs  @xcite .",
    "this evolutionary argument is supported by bl lacs negative cosmological evolution ; their number densities rise at around the same epoch as the decline of fsrqs  @xcite . bl",
    "lacs exhibit bz - powered jets  @xcite , indicating that significant magnetic fields may be sustained long after the cessation of significant accretion .",

    "the emission - line properties , and lack of x - ray emission from ic 2497 , seem to indicate this spiral galaxy is a highly obscured agn with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of hanny s voorwerp but not the galaxy s own circumnuclear gas  @xcite , or alternatively the luminosity of the central source has decreased dramatically within the last @xmath42  yr  @xcite",

    "is the major energy damping mechanism and nuclei are able to escape without suffering significant spallation , e.g. ngc 2832 ( which is near the center of the ta hot - spot ) .",
    "combining the ideas put forward in  @xcite we can now formulate a new hybrid model to explain the spectral shape of extragalactic cosmic rays , including the critical region of the ankle .",
    "namely , the secondary nucleons produced in the photodisintegration process would have a soft spectral index at the source , and consequently can explain the energy region below the ankle .",
    "note that after the photodisintegration process the secondary protons can still be accelerated to reach energies near the ankle . on the other hand ,",
    "heavy and medium mass nuclei are emitted with a harder spectral index , and therefore ( upon propagation to earth ) can populate the spectrum above the ankle , all the way to the gzk cutoff .",
    "we estimate that about 16% of the smbh in the universe could accelerate uhecr nuclei via the bz . at this stage , it is worthwhile to point out that for smbhs associated with jets terminating in lobes ( which can be detected in radio ) like cen a other cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms may be at play  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the emitted nuclei could suffer additional photodisintegration while diffusing in the source environment , as described in  @xcite .",
    "photodisintegration of high - energy nuclei , @xmath162 , is followed by immediate photoemission from the excited daughter nuclei , the photodisintegration process in the source environment would then produce a flux of gamma - rays .",
    "a suggestion of a correlation between uhecrs and nearby gamma - ray emitting agns has been put forward in  @xcite .",
    "such a correlation would be consistent with our model .",
    "however , we should exercise caution since the results in  @xcite are given with an _ a posteriori _ significance , and since the new agn correlation analyses has not shown an increased in significance over time  @xcite .    in closing , we study the dependence of our conclusions on the magnetic field strength . as we have shown , the smbhs which are capable of emitting uhecr nuclei without suffering significant spallation are those with masses @xmath54 .",
    "we can then rewrite the acceleration time scale ( [ muddler ] ) keeping @xmath163 as a variable , i.e. we take @xmath164 in fig .",

    "[ fig : varyb ] one can see that cr nuclei can be accelerated to the highest observed energies with @xmath165 .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of uhecrs being accelerated in nearby supermassive black holes , which are dormant remnants of previously active quasars .",
    "we have shown that these fast spinning objects are latent dynamos that can accelerate heavy nuclei up to the maximum observed energies .",
    "we have also shown that energy losses are dominated by photonuclear interactions on the ambient photon fields .",
    "armed with our findings we postulated a classification scheme for giant elliptical galaxies harboring supermassive black hole dynamos . in this classification",
    "we distinguish among two unequivocal type of cosmic ray sources according on how source parameters ( mass of the central engine and the ambient photon backgrounds ) impact the photonuclear interaction . in the first type nuclei",

    "namely , the secondary nucleons produced in the photodisintegration process would have a soft spectral index at the source , and consequently can explain the energy region below the ankle . on the other hand , heavy and medium mass nuclei are emitted with a harder spectral index , and therefore ( upon propagation to earth ) can populate the spectrum above the ankle , all the way to the gzk cutoff .",

    "<S> we re - examine the possibility of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays being accelerated in nearby dormant quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we particularize our study to heavy nuclei to accommodate the spectrum and nuclear composition recently reported by the pierre auger collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> particle acceleration is driven by the blandford - znajek mechanism , which wires the dormant spinning black holes as faraday unipolar dynamos . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that energy losses are dominated by photonuclear interactions on the ambient photon fields . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the local dark fossils of the past quasar activity can be classified on the basis of how source parameters ( mass of the central engine and photon background surrounding the accelerator ) impact the photonuclear interaction . in this classification </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to distinguish two unequivocal type of sources : those in which nuclei are completely photodisintegrated before escaping the acceleration region and those in which photopion production is the major energy damping mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue that the secondary nucleons from the photodisintegrated nuclei ( which have a steep spectral index at injection ) can populate the energy region below `` the ankle '' feature in the cosmic ray spectrum , whereas heavy and medium mass nuclei ( with a harder spectral index ) populate the energy region beyond `` the ankle '' , all the way to the high energy end of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that five potential quasar remnants from our cosmic backyard correlate with the hot - spot observed by the telescope array .    </S>",
