    "nuclei in interaction with external fields display a wide variety of collective vibrations known as giant resonances , associated with various degrees of freedom and multipolarities .",
    "the giant isovector dipole resonance and the giant isoscalar quadrupole resonance are the most studied examples in this class of phenomena .",
    "a particular mode , that is associated with vibrations in the number of particles , has been predicted in the 70s@xcite and discussed , under the name of giant pairing resonance , in the middle of the 80 s in a number of papers@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , despite some early efforts aimed to resolve some broad bump in the high - lying spectrum in ( p , t ) reactions@xcite , is still without any conclusive experimental confirmation . for a discussion , in particluar in connection with two - particle transfer reactions , on many aspects of pairing correlations in nuclei",
    "we refer to a recent review@xcite .",
    "we have studied the problem of collective pairing modes at high excitation energy in two neutron transfer reactions with the aim to prove the advantage of using unstable beam as a new tool to enhance the excitation of such modes @xcite .",
    "the main point is that with standard available beams one is faced with a large energy mismatch that strongly hinders the excitation of high - lying states and favours the transition to the ground state of the final system .",
    "instead the optimum q - value condition in the ( @xmath3he,@xmath4he ) stripping reaction suppresses the ground state and should allow the transition to 10 - 15 mev energy region .",
    "we have performed particle - particle rpa calculations on lead and bcs+rpa on tin , as paradigmatic examples of normal and superfluid systems , evaluating the response to the pairing operator .",
    "subsequently the two - neutron transfer form factors have been constructed in the framework of the macroscopic model@xcite and used in dwba computer codes .",
    "we have estimated cross - sections of the order of some millibarns , dominating over the mismatched transition to the ground state .",
    "recently we added similar calculations on other much studied targets to give some guide for experimental work .",
    "the formal analogy between particle - hole and particle - particle excitations is very well established both from the theoretical side@xcite and from the experimental side for what concern low - lying pairing vibrations around closed shell nuclei and pairing rotations in open shells .",
    "the predicted concentration of strength of a @xmath5 character in the high - energy region ( 8 - 15 mev for most nuclei ) is understood microscopically as the coherent superposition of 2p ( or 2h ) states in the next major shell above the fermi level .",
    "we have roughly depicted the situation in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .    in closed shell nuclei the addition of a pair of particles ( or holes ) to the next major shell , with a total energy @xmath6 , is expected to have a high degree of collectivity .",
    "also in the case of open shell nuclei the same is expected for the excitation of a pair of particles with @xmath7 energies .",
    "for normal nuclei the hamiltonian with a monopole strength interaction reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 annihilates a pair of particles coupled to @xmath10 total angular momentum .    getting rid of all the technicalities of the solution of the pp - rpa equations ( that may be found in the already cited work by the author ) we merely state that the pairing phonon may be expressed as a superposition of 2p ( or 2h ) states with proper forward and backward amplitudes ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the pair transfer strength , that is a measure of the amount of collectivity of a each state @xmath13 , is given by : @xmath14 .",
    "\\label{p5}\\ ] ] this quantity is plotted in the first column of fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) for the removal ( upper panel ) and addition mode ( lower panel ) . in the same figure",
    "are reported the pairing strength parameters for the states of @xmath1sn . to obtain these last quantities for superfluid spherical",
    "nuclei one has to rewrite the hamiltonian according to the bcs transformation and has to solve more complex rpa equations . in this case",
    "the pairing strength for the addition of two particles is given , for each state @xmath13 , by : @xmath15_{00}|0\\rangle =   \\sum_{j } \\sqrt{2j+1 } [ u^{2}_{j } x_{n}(j ) + v^{2}_{j}y_{n}(j)]\\ ] ] where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the usual occupation probabilities .",
    "the amount of collectivity is a clear signal of the structural existence of giant pairing vibrations in the high - lying energy region .",
    "we also report here a number of analogous results for other commonly studied targets    = 9.4pc    = 9.4pc    = 9.4pc    with the aim of giving some indications to experimentalists on the reasons why we think that lead and tin are some of the most promising candidates .",
    "we have studied two isotopes of calcium with closed shells .",
    "even if the absolute magnitudes of the @xmath18 is lower , it is worthwhile to notice that some enhancement is seen in the more neutron - rich @xmath19ca with respect to @xmath20ca .",
    "an important role in this change is certainly due to the different shell structure of the two nuclei as well as to the scheme that we implemented to obtain the set of single particle levels .",
    "the latter is responsible for the collectivity of the removal modes in both ca isotopes and also for the difficulty in finding out a collective state in the addition modes .",
    "we display also results for @xmath21zr where the strength is much more fragmented and the identification of the gpv is more difficult . in the work of broglia and bes estimates for the energy of the pairing resonance are given as @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev for normal and superfluid systems respectively .",
    "our figures follow roughly these prescriptions based on simple arguments ( and much more grounded in the case of normal nuclei ) as evident from table [ ta1 ] .",
    ".comparison of position of gpv between our calculation and the broglia and bes estimate .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 13.8pc    = 13.8pc    these cross - sections have been derived for sharp states , and we refer to the numbers in the last table when speaking of order of magnitude estimates . obviously cross - section in the high - lying energy region have a finite ( and large ) width that should be inserted for a more realistic description of the spectrum .",
    "we have chosen a simple scheme that gives a lorentzian distribution with a width that grows quadratically with the excitation energy , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 adjusted to give a width of 4 mev for the gpv .",
    "this could seem rather arbitrary since there is no reason for an _ a priori _ assignment of this quantity .",
    "we have been brought to this simple prescription because other collective states ( of different nature ) lying in the same energy region display similar values for their width , and it is reasonable to assume some rule to narrow the low - energy states and to broaden the high - energy ones .",
    "the final achievements for the four reactions studied in detail are presented in figure [ fig4 ] where the areas corresponding to the cross - sections given above have been shaded to give a feeling of the relative magnitudes of the transition to the ground states and to the gpv s . it is worthwhile to note that in the case of pb there is a considerable gain in using unstable beams , while in sn is much less evident .",
    "one sees the need for unstable helium when compares the magnitude for the pairing resonance in the right a ) and b ) panels with the peak at zero energy : in the first panel the transition to the ground state is extremely hindered .",
    "a @xmath3he beam is currently available ( or it will be available in the very near future ) in many radioactive ion beams facilities around the world and the calculations that we have presented could allow a planning for future experiments aimed to study the not yet completely unraveled role of pairing interaction in common nuclei , using exotic weakly bound nuclei as useful tools .",
