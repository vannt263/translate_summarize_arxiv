    "physics starts in general with the notion of space and time . in a non - relativistic theory physical objects are understood to be localized in space and to move in time . in the case of classical mechanics these objects are represented by points in a configuration manifold @xmath0 and its building blocks are geometrical objects living @xmath0 : borel sets on @xmath0 or equivalently functions on @xmath0 may be taken to describe the localization of the system , and vectorfields and their flows on @xmath0 can be used to describe the displacements , i.e.  the possible movements of the system on @xmath0 . in this picture",
    "the functions and vectorfields serve to describe the kinematics of the classical system ; endowed with the natural algebraic ( semi - direct sum ) structure they form the _ kinematical algebra _ @xmath1 . in symplectic mechanics",
    "this algebra occurs as the algebra of functions on phase space that are affine in momentum .",
    "the dynamics of such a classical system  the introduction of time  is given by a second order differential equations on @xmath0 , i.e.geometrically , by vectorfields on the tangent bundle @xmath2 fulfilling a certain flip condition .",
    "if @xmath0 is ( pseudo-)riemannian this condition can be transported to the cotangent bundle and yields a natural restriction on the time evolution of functions on @xmath0 .",
    "a quantization of the classical theory will therefore involve two steps :    first , it requires a representation of the kinematical algebra by self - adjoint operators in a separable hilbert - space . starting from ideas of i.e.  segal @xcite and g.w .",
    "mackey@xcite the _ quantum borel kinematics _ was developed @xcite and classified unitarily inequivalent ( local and differentiable ) representations of the kinematical algebra @xmath1 ; we review the results in section [ qbk : sec ] .",
    "the phase space description establishes a relation of this borel quantization to geometric quantization ( section [ rgq : sec ] ) .",
    "this relation will be used in section [ bqef : sec ] to generalize the scheme to include external fields .",
    "secondly , there should be an analogue of the classical condition on the time evolution of functions on @xmath0 for their quantized counterparts .",
    "this relation will be established in section [ fer : sec ] . as we will see in section [ nse : sec ]",
    "this condition leads to nonlinear schrdinger equations , if pure states evolve into pure states .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the idea of quantum borel kinematics @xcite is to describe the quantization of the _ localization _ and the _ displacement _ of a system on a smooth connected configuration - manifold @xmath0 .",
    "the localization is characterized classically by borel sets @xmath3 and is `` quantized '' by a projection valued measure @xmath4 on a separable hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , these projection valued measures provide a representation of the infinite dimensional algebra @xmath6 of smooth functions on @xmath0 via the spectral integral @xmath7 on a domain @xmath8 .",
    "the classical displacements of the system on @xmath0 are described by the flow @xmath9 of complete smooth vectorfields @xmath10 .",
    "borel sets are displaced by @xmath11    a quantization of these displacements is achieved by a representation of the flows @xmath9 by one parameter groups of unitary operators on @xmath5 : @xmath12 with generators @xmath13 depending on the vectorfield .",
    "the representation should be consistent with the quantization of the localization of the system , i.e.  for any given @xmath14 we require @xmath15 to be a _ system of imprimitivity _ @xcite : @xmath16    using fundamental results on the structure of these systems of imprimitivity @xcite one can show that for any given @xmath14 on a common dense domain @xmath17 for all @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath20 & = & 0\\ , , \\\\",

    "furthermore , the hilbert space can be realized as the space of square integrable sections of a flat hermitean line bundle @xmath36 with respect to a smooth measure @xmath37 on @xmath0 , @xmath38 in this realization the representation of the kinematical algebra reads for all sections @xmath39 ( @xmath40 denotes the characteristic function of the set @xmath41 , @xmath42 the divergence w.r.t .  the measure @xmath37 )",

    "the quantization method known as _ geometric quantization _ usually starts with a general classical phase space , i.e.  a symplectic manifold @xmath51 .",
    "given a configuration space @xmath0 , the natural choice is the cotangent bundle @xmath52 with canonical one - from @xmath53 and symplectic form @xmath54 . a `` full quantization '' , i.e.  an irreducible selfadjoint representation of the poisson - algebra @xmath55 defined by the symplectic structure fails in general .",
    "depending on the polarization chosen only a sub - algebra of `` quantizable observables '' is represented irreducibly .",
    "if , for instance , a complex polarization on @xmath56 is chosen , the sub - algebra @xmath57 of polynomials in @xmath58 of max .  second order can be represented irreducibly .",
    "this leads to a quantization of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator including the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "thus the dynamics of the particular system is also quantized .    in general for @xmath59 and the vertical polarization the set @xmath60 of functions linear in the momenta",

    "note that so far only the kinematics of the system has been quantized and a dynamics has to be introduced by an additional argument . in geometric quantization",
    "this is generally achieved by choosing another suitable polarization in which the hamiltonian is quantizable and the use of the bks - kernel ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . here",
    "we will proceed differently in section .      to describe the interaction with external ( magnetic ) fields on @xmath0 we utilize the phase space picture (",

    "there is a natural isomorphism @xmath109 with inverse @xmath110 . using this isomorphism",
    "we can define a dynamical vectorfield @xmath111 on @xmath70 and the condition turns into @xmath112 let @xmath113 be the flow of @xmath114 on @xmath70 and @xmath115 be the _ classical time evolution _ of the classical state @xmath116 then from and we get the following condition for the time evolution of the ( quantizable ) observable @xmath63 @xcite : @xmath117    we use this formula for a quantum analogue , i.e.  a condition for the time evolution of the quantum mechanical states @xmath118 , @xmath119 and require that in the mean quantum operators behave under the time evolution of the quantum states @xmath120 like the classical observables under the time evolution of the classical states @xmath121 , i.e.  a generalization of the first ehrenfest relation of quantum mechanics for all @xmath122 @xmath123 now there are unitarily inequivalent representations of the operator @xmath13 leading to different conditions on the time evolution of the quantum mechanical state .",
    "indeed , there is _ no unitary _ time evolution of the states satisfying except for @xmath67 .",
    "this is basically due to the algebraic ( multiplicative ) structure of @xmath6 .",
    "we have two alternative ways to obtain evolution equations satisfying for @xmath124 .",
    "the first way is to look for evolutions of density matrices , i.e.  of positive trace - class operators on @xmath5 with trace 1 @xmath125 fulfilling @xmath126 by the usual interpretation of @xmath127 as statistical mixtures , @xmath128 has to be _",
    "linear_.    for completely positive , norm - continuous there is a classification of their generators given by lindblad @xcite .",
    "though we are not necessarily looking for norm - continuous evolutions , there are lindblad - type evolution equations satisfying @xcite ; the details of this way will be explained elsewhere .",
    "the second alternative is to restrict to pure states , @xmath129 fulfilling @xmath130 if the line bundle is trivializable , this leads formally to nonlinear schrdinger equations for wavefunctions @xmath131 , as we will see in the next section .      for trivial line bundles @xmath44 , @xmath132 , and for wave functions @xmath133 condition reads @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the probability distribution and the probability current , respectively .",

    "all measurements can in principle be reduced to positional ones ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath148 was thus called a _ nonlinear gauge transformation _ and one can identify gauge equivalent classes among the equations in @xcite .    because of some confusion in the context of nonlinear quantum theories ( and superluminal communications therein ) we emphasize finally that equation describes only the nonlinear time evolution of pure states .",
