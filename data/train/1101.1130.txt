    "the doubly heavy baryons , which represent a new type of objects in comparison with the ordinary baryons , were first predicted by ref.@xcite .",
    "these baryons shall offer a good platform for testing various theories and models , such as the quark model , the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , the potential model and so on .",
    "moreover , to know these baryons well can help us to understand the heavy - flavor physics , the weak interaction , the charge - parity violation , and etc .. a number of heavy baryons were discovered by several experiment collaborations , such as cleo , belle and babar , argus , selex and cdf collaborations , a review on this point can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , for the family of double - heavy baryons , only @xmath12 has been observed and reported @xcite . while due to their smaller production rate , few @xmath0 and @xmath13 have been observed . even for @xmath12 ,",
    "its measured production rate and decay width are much larger than most of the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "more data are needed to clarify the present situation .    the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which is designed to run with a high center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "collision energy up to @xmath14 tev and a high luminosity up to @xmath15 @xcite , shall be of great help for the purpose . at the present , it is setting up for running with @xmath8 tev and will result in an integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath16 after its first year of running .",
    "taking into account the prospects of observation and measurement of doubly heavy baryons at lhc , it would be interesting to investigate the properties of these states . in the present paper",
    ", we shall first concentrate our attention on the hadronic production of @xmath0 , and then make a comparative study with those of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the doubly heavy baryon can be regarded as a combination of the heavy diquark and a light quark @xcite .",
    "the dominant mechanism for the hadronic production of @xmath0 baryon is the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism via the process @xmath17 .",
    "the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism includes 36 feynman diagrams similar to the case of the @xmath12 baryon production @xcite and the @xmath18 meson production @xcite , all of which can be schematically represented by fig.([diag ] ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two momenta for the initial gluons , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are momenta for the two outgoing @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the momentum of @xmath0",
    ". the intermediate @xmath1-diquark pair can be in one of the four fock states , i.e. @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] respectively . more definitely ,",
    "according to refs.@xcite , the hadronic production of @xmath0 can be divided into three steps : the first step is the production of a @xmath30-pair and a @xmath31-pair that can be calculated by pqcd , since the intermediate gluon should be hard enough to form a heavy quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the second step is that the two heavy quarks fusion into a binding @xmath1-diquark , and the third step is the fragmentation of such diquark into the desired baryon by grabbing a light quark and suitable number of gluons when needs .",
    "the second and the third steps are non - perturbative , which can be described by a universal matrix element within the nrqcd framework @xcite",
    ".        the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we give the main idea in dealing with the @xmath0 hadroproduction .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec.iii . and in sec.iv",
    ", we make a discussion on the main uncertainties for @xmath0 hadroproduction and a comparison of the hadronic production of @xmath0 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    "within the nrqcd framework , the total hadronic cross - section for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism can be schematically written as the following factorization form @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 or @xmath35 ; @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) is the distribution function of parton @xmath38 in hadron @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the factorization scale and @xmath41 is the renormalization scale , and for convenience , we take them to be the transverse mass of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 stands for the cross - section for the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess , which can be expressed as @xcite ,    @xmath44 ) \\cdot h^{(bc)}_3 + h(gg\\to ( bc)_{\\bf 6}[^1s_0 ] ) \\cdot h^{(bc)}_1 + h(gg\\to ( bc)_{\\bf\\bar 3}[^1s_0 ] ) \\cdot { h'}^{(bc)}_3 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + h(gg\\to ( bc)_{\\bf 6}[^3s_1])\\cdot { h'}^{(bc)}_1 + \\cdots , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the ellipsis stands for the terms in higher orders of @xmath45 , @xmath45 is the relative velocity between the constitute @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks .",
    "@xmath48 ) $ ] or @xmath49)$ ] is the perturbative coefficient for producing @xmath1-diquark in different spin and color configurations respectively .",
    "four matrix elements : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 characterize the transitions of the @xmath1-diquark in @xmath54_{\\bf 6}$ ] , @xmath55_{\\bf\\bar 3}$ ] , @xmath55_{\\bf 6}$ ] , @xmath54_{\\bf\\bar 3}$ ] spin and color configurations into @xmath0 baryon respectively .",
    "@xmath51 can be related to the wavefunction of the color anti - triplet diquark @xmath26 $ ] as @xmath56 . according to the discussions shown by ref.@xcite , other matrix elements @xmath50 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are of the same order in @xmath45 as @xmath51 .",
    "since all these matrix elements emerge as overall parameters , we can easily improve our numerical results when we know these matrix elements well .",
    "naively , we take all of them to be @xmath51 to do our estimation @xcite .    to derive analytical squared amplitude of the 36 feynman diagrams for the hard subprocess is a tedious task , since it contains non - abelian gluons and massive fermions . in refs.@xcite",
    ", the so - called improved helicity amplitude approach has been adopted to derive analytic expressions for the process at the amplitude level . and basing on the obtained sententious and analytical expressions , an effective generator genxicc @xcite for simulating @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 events has been accomplished . here",
    "we shall use genxicc to make a detailed study on the hadronic production of @xmath0 .",
    "to be consistent with the leading - order ( lo ) hard scattering amplitude , the lo parton distribution function ( pdf ) of cteq group , i.e. cteq6l @xcite , and the lo running @xmath57 are adopted in doing the numerical calculation . and",
    "for other parameters we adopt the following values @xcite : @xmath58    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ cbccross14tev ]    to be useful reference , we make a comparison of the hadronic production of @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 at lhc .",
    "the total cross sections are presented in tab.[cbccross14tev ] , where @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] stand for the results for the diquark in spin - triplet and spin - singlet states respectively .",
    "more explicitly , for hadronic production of @xmath12 , one needs to consider the contributions from the two diquark states @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] . as for hadronic production of @xmath13",
    ", one needs to consider the contributions from the two diquark states @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] . while for the case of @xmath0 , one needs to consider the contributions from the four diquark states @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ] .    from tab.[cbccross14tev ] , one can see that the total cross section of @xmath0 is at the same order of that of @xmath12 , i.e. it is about @xmath67 and @xmath68 of that of @xmath12 for @xmath8 tev and @xmath9 tev respectively . while , the total cross section of @xmath13 is only @xmath69 and @xmath70 of that of @xmath12 for @xmath8 tev and @xmath9 tev respectively .",
    "then , similar to the case of @xmath12 that has been measured by the selex experiment at tevatron @xcite , it would be possible for @xmath0 be fully studied at lhc .",
    "we draw the @xmath11- and @xmath71- distributions for @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 production under the case of @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 in figs.([pt4yall],[y15ptall ] ) , where each curve includes the sum of all the mentioned s - wave diquark states .",
    "fig.([y15ptall ] ) shows that production cross section of @xmath0 is smaller than that of @xmath12 in the lower @xmath10 region , however it will dominant over that of @xmath12 when @xmath74 gev .",
    "we have analyzed the hadronic production of @xmath0 via the dominant gluon - gluon fusion mechanism at lhc with the center - of - mass energy @xmath8 tev and @xmath9 tev respectively . for experimental usage ,",
    "the total and the interested differential cross - sections have been estimated under typical cut conditions for the lhc detectors cms , atlas and lhcb .",
    "numerical results show that about @xmath75 and @xmath7 @xmath0 events per year can be produced for @xmath8 tev and @xmath9 tev under the condition of @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath0 can be observed and studied at lhc .",
    "main uncertainties for the estimation have been discussed and a comparative study on the hadronic production of @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 at lhc with @xmath8 tev and @xmath9 tev have also been presented . as for the total production cross section under the case of @xmath76 gev , we have @xmath77 , however the differential cross - section of @xmath0 will dominant over that of @xmath12 when @xmath74 gev .    in the above , we have not distinguished the light components in the baryon .",
    "more subtly , as for the production of @xmath0 , after the formation of the heavy @xmath1-diquark , it will grab a light anti - quark ( with gluons when necessary ) from the hadron collision environment to form a colorless double heavy baryon with the relative possibility for the light quark as @xmath78 @xcite , i.e. to form the baryons @xmath79 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "more precisely , when the diquark @xmath1 is produced , it will fragment into @xmath79 with @xmath82 probability , @xmath80 with @xmath82 probability and @xmath83 with @xmath84 probability accordingly .",
    "if enough @xmath0 events can be accumulated at lhc , then one may have chances to study the @xmath85 or @xmath81 separately from their decay products .",
