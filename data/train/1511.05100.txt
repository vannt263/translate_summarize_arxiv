    "precise measurement of _ optical _ frequencies ( of order 10@xmath2 hz ) is complicated by the fact that the si unit of time is defined in terms of a microwave hyperfine transition in @xmath3cs  one at @xmath4 hz .",
    "thus the frequency measurement requires a span of more than 5 orders - of - magnitude with no phase error , not an easy task . in recent times , the use of a femtosecond frequency comb has enabled such a precise span @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique , which is lower cost and simpler , is to use an optical transition as a secondary frequency standard , and compare an unknown frequency with the reference . in our laboratory , we have pioneered such a technique where we use a ring - cavity resonator as a transfer cavity between the unknown and reference frequencies @xcite .",
    "the reference in these experiments was a laser locked to a hyperfine transition in the d@xmath1 line of @xmath5rb ( at 780 nm ) , whose absolute frequency has been measured using a frequency chain to 10 khz precision @xcite .    the technique is particularly suited to the measurement of electric - dipole allowed ( e1 ) transitions because the @xmath6 for such transitions is about @xmath7 .",
    "thus a precision of 10 khz ( which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of @xmath8 in the measurement of an optical transition ) requires splitting the spectral line by 1 in 1000 , which is a considerable experimental challenge . in other words ,",
    "the precision of measurements on such transitions is limited by the linewidth of the transition itself and not the measurement technique , which makes the ring - cavity resonator a competitive alternative to the comb method .    since the natural linewidth of the d@xmath1 line used as the frequency reference is about 6 mhz , reaching a precision of 10 khz in the lock point itself requires better than 1 in 500 reproducibility .",
    "therefore an attractive option is to use a two - photon transition , which are forbidden from e1 selection rules , and consequently have sub - mhz natural linewidth .",
    "one such transition is the 5s@xmath9 5d@xmath10 transition in rb with a natural linewidth of 300 khz .",
    "the absolute frequency of this transition ( at 778 nm ) has been measured by nez et al .  with 8 khz precision @xcite , thus making it a useful secondary reference .",
    "in addition , a two - photon transition can be made doppler free if the two photons come from counter - propagating beams , because only zero - velocity atoms are resonant with both beams .    in this work ,",
    "we report observation of the 5s@xmath11 5d@xmath10 two - photon transition in rb using a diode laser system .",
    "we are able to resolve the various hyperfine transitions in the two isotopes , @xmath12rb and @xmath5rb .",
    "we obtain a linewidth of about 2.2 mhz ( limited by optical feedback into the diode laser system ) , which is about 510 times better than the linewidth obtained for the d@xmath1 line used as a frequency reference in the ring - cavity resonator technique .",
    "the diode laser system is a home - built grating stabilized diode laser @xcite .",
    "the laser has a free running wave length of 784 nm and a maximum power of 120 mw , which reduces to 70 mw after feedback .",
    "the linewidth after feedback is about 1 mhz . using a combination of operating temperature and grating angle ,",
    "the system is brought to operate near 778 nm required for accessing the two - photon transition .",
    "coarse tuning is achieved using a commercial wavemeter ( ws ultimate from high finesse laser & electronic systems ) .",
    "the laser beam has elliptic cross - section with @xmath13 diameter of 3 mm @xmath14 5 mm .",
    "it is linearly polarized .",
    "the schematic of the experiment is shown in the fig .",
    "[ twophotonsetup ] .",
    "the laser output first passes through a two - stage optical isolator ( with 60 db isolation ) , and then through a rb vapor cell heated to @xmath15c .",
    "the cell is cylindrical in shape with 25 mm diameter and 50 mm length .",
    "it is pure ( no buffer gas ) and contains the two isotopes of rb in their natural abundances  @xmath16rb and @xmath17rb .",
    "the laser beam is focused into the cell using a biconvex lens ( l1 ) of focal length 300 mm .",
    "after the cell , the beam passes through a second lens ( l2 ) of the focal length 100 mm before being retro - reflected from a mirror .",
    "the relevant energy levels in the two isotopes are shown in fig .",
    "[ twophotonenergylevel ] .",
    "the isotope @xmath12rb has @xmath18 and therefore 6 hyperfine levels in the d@xmath10 state .",
    "the other isotope @xmath5rb has @xmath19 and therefore 4 hyperfine levels in the d@xmath10 state .",
    "the signal from population in the d@xmath10 state is the blue fluorescence at 420 nm due to radiative cascade through the intermediate 6p@xmath20 state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ twophotonenergylevel](a ) .",
    "the fluorescence signal ( which is also visible to the naked eye ) is measured by a r928 hamamatsu photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) using a pair of lenses ( l3 in the schematic figure ) .",
    "the solid angle subtended by the lens system is such that about @xmath21 of the fluorescence light is collected .",
    "the pmt has a 420 nm interference filter in front with peak transmission of @xmath22 .",
    "the measured two - photon spectra in the two isotopes are shown in fig .",
    "[ twophotonsignals ] .",
    "there are four spectra corresponding to the two ground hyperfine levels in each isotope@xmath23 in @xmath12rb and @xmath24 in @xmath12rb .",
    "the selection rules for a two - photon transition are @xmath25 , therefore each spectrum has several well - resolved peaks corresponding to this rule . only the @xmath26 peaks in @xmath12rb are not resolved .",
    "as expected , the spectra appear on a flat doppler - free background .",
    "the resolved peaks have a lorentzian lineshape with a linewidth of about 2.2 mhz .",
    "this increase from the natural linewidth of 300 khz is due to optical feedback into the laser from the system . despite using an optical isolator in front of the laser , stable spectra of the kind shown",
    "are obtained only when the counter - propagating beam is slightly misaligned . for comparison ,",
    "the linewidth seen in ref .",
    "@xcite was 500 khz , but the experiment was done with a frequency stabilized ti - sapphire laser with frequency uncertainty of only 2 khz , and a laser that was much less sensitive to optical feedback .    to verify that it is a two - photon transition , we have studied the signal strength as function of laser power . for a two - photon transition ,",
    "the rate varies as the square of the laser power .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ twophotonsquarelaw ] , along with a quadratic fit to the data .",
    "the error bars represent the standard deviation for each data set , which consists of 20 points .",
    "the quadratic curve fits the data well within the error bars , highlighting the two - photon nature of the spectrum .",
    "in summary , we have observed the @xmath27 two - photon transitions in a rb vapor cell using a diode laser system .",
    "the various hyperfine transitions in the two isotopes are well resolved and have a linewidth of about 2.2 mhz .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the 300 khz natural linewidth , and is due to laser jitter caused by optical feedback .",
    "but the linewidth is still about an order - of - magnitude smaller than the linewidth obtained for the d@xmath1 line , which is used in our laboratory as a frequency reference in a ring - cavity resonator @xcite .",
    "this makes the two - photon transition a useful frequency reference for improved precision in the ring - cavity technique .",
