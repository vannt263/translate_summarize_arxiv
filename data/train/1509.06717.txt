    "graphene is a two dimensional array of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice .",
    "it is one to the most interesting materials in solid state physics nowadays due to its exceptional properties and its potential nanothechnological applications , one of the reasons perhaps for which andrei geim and konstantin novoselov were laureated with a nobel prize in physics in 2010 .",
    "progress in the experimental isolation of monolayer graphene samples  @xcite has led to an extensive exploration of the electronic properties of this material .",
    "its crystal structure allows an accurate tight - binding description at low energies , which becomes , in the continuous limit , a version of massless quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , qed@xmath3 , for the charge carriers restricted to move along a membrane  @xcite , but in which photon are allowed to move throughout space in such a way that the static coulomb interaction is still described by a potential that varies as the inverse of the distance on the plane of motion of quasiparticles .",
    "this model incorporates the most essential and well - established properties of the charge carrier dynamics : the symmetries of the hexagonal lattice , the linearity of the dispersion relation , a very small mass gap ( if any ) , and a characteristic propagation velocity which is 1/300 of the speed of light in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of graphene is the visual transparency of its membranes .",
    "opacity of layers of this crystal has been measured  @xcite to be roughly 2.3% with almost negligible reflectance .",
    "this observation has opened the possibility of using monolayer graphene in combination with bio - materials to produce clean hydrogen by photocatalysis  @xcite with visible light .",
    "the problem of light absorption in graphene can be addressed from quantum field theoretical arguments  @xcite , considering the dirac picture for its charge carriers in terms of the degrees of freedom of qed@xmath3 under different assumptions .",
    "parity violating effects were considered in  @xcite , whereas the influence of a strong and weak magnetic field were considered in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "measurements of magneto - optical properties of epitaxial graphene have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , particularly the polarization rotation and light absorption .",
    "quantum faraday and kerr rotations have also been experimentally determined  @xcite and a complete framework based on the equations of motion was presented in  @xcite to describe those effects .    in this article",
    "we explore an analog to the faraday effect in deformed graphene .",
    "we consider deformations of the membrane which break parity @xmath4 and time - reversal @xmath5 symmetries , rendering the sublattices inequivalent .",
    "examples of such deformations are , for instance , strains  @xcite , known to give rise to homogeneous pseudomagnetic fields .",
    "the net effect of deformations is parametrized in terms of a @xmath4 and @xmath5 breaking haldane mass  @xcite which plays the role of an external magnetic field .",
    "we find that the mentioned mass term induces a change in the angle of polarization for monochromatic light passing perpendicularly through the graphene sample .",
    "our key observation is that the haldane mass induces a half - filling quantum hall effect ( qhe ) per fermion species ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) , and because the change of the angle of polarization of light passing through a graphene membrane can be expressed entirely in terms of the hall conductivity  @xcite , the effect we propose in this work can be expressed solely in terms of the mass parameter that accounts for deformations in graphene .",
    "the effect we observe can be the basis of an optical filter based on mechanical deformation of graphene . to describe our findings",
    ", we have organized the remaining of this article as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we introduce a continuous model for the charge carriers in graphene and explicitly show the decomposition of the propagator for two different fermions species according to their _",
    "chiralities_. we provide a proper meaning of this property in terms of the lattice structure of graphene . in sec .",
    "3 we calculate the conductivity tensor through the filling factor using the kubo formula and in sec",
    ". 4 we review the problem of light absorption in graphene through the modified maxwell s equations which describe the penetration of electromagnetic waves into the sample . from the matching conditions , we calculate the transmission coefficients and the angle of polarization rotation of transmitted light .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "tight - binding approach to the description of monolayer graphene corresponds in the continuum to a massless version of quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , qed3 , but with a static coulomb interaction which varies as the inverse of the distance , just as in ordinary space  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics can be modeled from the action @xmath6=-\\frac{1}{4}\\int d^4x f_{\\hat{\\mu}\\hat{\\nu}}^2+\\int d^3x \\bar\\psi { \\not \\ ! d}\\psi\\ ; , \\label{action}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 representing the gauge field that propagates in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions and @xmath10 the quasiparticle fermion field . the symmetry which exists between the two triangular sublattices allows to merge the fermion content into a single four - component theory for the charge carriers . in our considerations , circumflexed greek indices @xmath11 and so on take the values 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ; greek indices",
    "@xmath12 etcetera run from 0 to 2 ; and latin indices @xmath13 and so on which label the spatial coordinates on the graphene layer take the values 1 and 2 .",
    "moreover , the re - scaled @xmath14 dirac matrices are such that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and for later convenience , we also consider the matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi velocity of quasiparticles in the crystal . in the natural units of the system ( namely , when @xmath20 ) , the form of the lagrangian has been dubbed as reduced qed and has been proposed in the context of brane - world scenarios  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we consider @xmath21 @xmath22 notice that in this case , the free , massless dirac lagrangian @xmath23 is invariant under the two chiral - like transformations @xmath24 which means that besides the ordinary dirac mass term , we can introduce a second term @xmath25 with @xmath26/2 $ ] , referred to as the haldane mass term  @xcite .",
    "such a term is invariant under the transformations in eq .",
    "( [ chiral ] ) . however , it breaks parity @xmath0 and time - reversal @xmath1 symmetries .",
    "we stress that the chiral character of the transformations  ( [ chiral ] ) is not related to the quasiparticle spin , but rather to their pseudospin .",
    "the massive lagrangian thus becomes @xmath27 introducing the chiral - like projection operators @xmath28 which verify @xmath29 and @xmath30 we can re - express the lagrangian  ( [ lag1 ] ) in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the `` left- '' and `` right - handed '' quasiparticle fields are @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the lagrangian describes two different charge carrier species which are non degenerated in mass : one of them becomes lighter and the other heavier as @xmath34 increases .",
    "this difference implies that the interaction between the two species in the reciprocal lattice is different .",
    "this type of asymmetry that can be introduced as a constant deformation on the graphene membrane that modifies the fundamental cell , but not the periodicity of the sample , which means that as one deforms the graphene membrane along one direction , @xmath34 grows and in consequence , the differences between the species is more evident .",
    "the decomposition of the free quasiparticle propagator corresponding to  ( [ lag2 ] ) is @xmath35\\chi_+ + \\left[\\frac{{\\not\\ !",

    "it is well known that the hall conductivity for the qhe can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a small integer ( integer qhe ) , or a fraction ( fractional qhe ) , the so - called filling factor . in the absence of magnetic fields",
    ", we can still have qhe provided parity and/or time reversal symmetries are broken in the lagrangian and one form to achieve this is to consider the haldane mass term  @xcite .",
    "a helpful tool for the calculation of the transverse conductivity via the filling factor is the kubo formula , which expresses the linear response of an observable quantity due to a time - dependent perturbation . in terms of the fermion propagator",
    ", the filling factor is found through  @xcite @xmath38\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the electron propagator , @xmath40 the levi - civita symbol and @xmath41 . using the chiral - like decomposition of eq .",

    "accordingly , from eq .",
    "( [ fillingsum ] ) the filling factor is @xmath53 that gives @xmath54 if @xmath55 , and @xmath56 if @xmath57 . in the latter case , the hall conductivity becomes @xmath58 which becomes the key ingredient to address the problem of light absorption in graphene below .",
    "from the action in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , we can describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the graphene sample according to the modified maxwell s equations @xmath59 subject to the conditions @xmath60 in the above expressions , @xmath61 represents the vacuum polarization tensor , which has the general form @xmath62\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath63 and @xmath64 representing polarization scalar functions .",
    "the first term describes the part that preserves parity and has been used to estimate the light absorption  @xcite , while the second part describes the term that breaks parity , which we are interested to explore in this work .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we interpret the delta function in eq .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) as a current in the plane the graphene membrane .",
    "thus , from ohm s law , @xmath65 assuming a varying incident electric wave with frequency @xmath2 expressed in a temporal gauge @xmath66 , we can take @xmath67 , which from the generalized maxwell s equations  ( [ maxwell ] ) allows us to write @xmath68 .",
    "finally , we can identify from ohm s law , the conductivity tensor as @xmath69 this expression becomes useful in what follows .",
    "for the frim problem , let us consider a plane wave of frequency @xmath2 , which travels along the @xmath70-direction from below the graphene layer with a linear polarization along the @xmath71 direction .",
    "moreover , considering that the wave passes through the graphene plane , the reflected and transmitted waves can be described as @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the unit vectors along the directions @xmath74 and @xmath75 on the membrane . the boundary conditions  ( [ bc ] ) simplify to @xmath76 a_{b } \\bigg|_{z=0}\\ ; , \\label{bc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that the transmission coefficients can be straightforwardly obtained  @xcite @xmath77 the angle of polarization rotation @xmath78 is obtained as follows : @xmath79 therefore , in terms of the hall conductivity , the angle of frim @xmath78 becomes @xmath80 substituting the explicit form of @xmath81 from the eq .",
    "( [ sigmafilling ] ) , we finally arrive at the main result of this article , namely , @xmath82 observe that frim effect would appear only when the parity and time reversal symmetries are broken , in consistency with the experimental and theoretical findings for these quantities in absence of external fields as well as in and the presence of a strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the transverse ( hall ) conductivity in a low energy effective model of graphene within a rqed@xmath3 framework , in which we consider an ordinary mass term @xmath83 that is invariant under @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the haldane mass term @xmath84 that is invariant under pseudo - chiral transformations , eq .",
    "( [ chiral ] ) , but breaks parity and time reversal .",
    "those mass parameters might be thought as effective parametrizations of strains and other distortions in the crystalline structure of pristine graphene .",
    "considering both the mass terms , the kubo formula yields a half - filling factor per fermion species so long @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetries are explicitly broken . in our case , we obtained @xmath85 . from the corresponding hall conductivity",
    ", we have estimated the faraday rotation angle @xmath78 of an incident wave . finally , we observe that the angle of polarization rotation even in the absence of external magnetic fields is @xmath86 when @xmath55 and @xmath87 when @xmath57 .",
    "this opens the possibility to measure that the polarization rotation with visible light in deformed graphene and might be helpful to design optical filters .",
