    "about 95% of the energy contents of the universe appears to be of unknown origin , in the form of dark matter and dark energy . while there is a lot of astrophysical evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy , a deeper understanding of the physical nature of these main ingredients of the universe is still lacking .",
    "clearly it is important to design new experiments on earth that could have the potential to unravel some of the unknown physics underlying dark matter and dark energy .    at the particle physics level",
    ", there are two main candidates what dark matter could be .",
    "these are wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) @xcite and axions @xcite .",
    "wimps are motivated by supersymmetry , whereas axions are motivated by the solution of the strong cp problem in qcd .",
    "various experimental searches to detect wimps @xcite and axion - like particles @xcite on the earth are currently going on .    very recently , there have been a couple of new suggestions how one could possibly detect dark matter axions in laboratory experiments on the earth @xcite .",
    "all these proposals have in common that they are based on relatively small devices and that they suggest to look for small oscillating electric currents induced by axion flow , with a frequency given by the axion mass .",
    "proposal 1 @xcite is based on a technique similar to nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmri ) , known from medical imaging .",
    "proposal 2 @xcite is based on resonance effects in josephson junctions .",
    "proposal 3 @xcite suggests to use lc circuits cooled down to mk temperatures .",
    "further interesting proposals are based on topological magnetic insulators @xcite and atomic systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed calculation describing the physics of proposal 2 , starting from the field equations of axion electrodynamics in a josephson environment .",
    "in contrast to axions in vacuum , in a josephson junction the axion has the possibility to induce electric supercurrents , rather than just ordinary currents .",
    "our main result presented in this paper is that , besides the trivial solution where the axion passes through the josephson junction without interaction , there is a nontrivial solution to the axion field equations due to these supercurrents .",
    "we show that the nontrivial solution implies the existence of a huge ( formal ) axion - flow generated magnetic field in a tiny surface area of the weak - link region of the junction , which makes incoming axions decay into microwave photons .",
    "the axion flow from the galactic halo through the junction then leads to a small measurable excess current of cooper pairs , for which we will derive a concrete formula .",
    "the experimental consequence of this are shapiro steps @xcite generated by axion flow , which are small but observable provided certain conditions on the design of the josephson junction are satisfied .",
    "we will derive these conditions explicitly .",
    "an experiment by hoffmann et al . based on s",
    "/ n / s josephson junctions @xcite , discussed in detail in @xcite , provided evidence for an axion mass of 110 @xmath1 and an axionic dark matter density of about 0.05 gev/@xmath2 if interpreted in this way . here",
    "we will discuss the results of four different experiments @xcite . in all four cases small shapiro step - like anomalies",
    "have been observed that , if interpreted within our theory , point towards an axion mass of @xmath3ev .",
    "the predicted axion mass value has profound cosmological implications .",
    "if this value is confirmed by further experiments , it means that the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking took place _ after _ inflation @xcite .",
    "employing the recent results of @xcite our result implies that the fractional contribution @xmath4 to the cosmic axion density from decays of axionic strings and walls is @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we write down the axion field equations in a josephson junction .",
    "the nontrivial solution , where the axion - induced electric current manifests itself as a supercurrent within the junction , is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this solution is further worked out in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present a short calculation how s / n / s josephson junctions should be designed in order to serve as optimum axion detectors .",
    "section 6 discusses some experimental candidate signals seen in various josephson experiments that could possibly be associated with the nontrivial solution of section 3 .",
    "section 7 compares our mass estimate from josephson resonances with cosmological and astrophysical bounds on the axion mass .",
    "finally , our concluding remarks are given in section 8 .",
    "let us consider the classical field equations of axion electrodynamics @xcite in a josephson junction ( jj ) @xcite .",

    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 denote electric current and charge densities .",
    "the expected mass of the qcd dark matter axion is in the region @xmath26ev to @xmath27ev due to astrophysical and cosmological constraints ; the corresponding compton wave length is much larger than the typical size of a jj .",
    "thus we may neglect spatial gradient terms @xmath28 in the above equations and consider the axion field as being approximately spatially homogeneous .",
    "the most important axion contribution for detection purposes comes from the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) : in a magnetic field @xmath14 , temporal changes @xmath29 of the axion angle imply an axion - induced electric current density @xmath30 given by @xmath31 note that this current is in the direction of the magnetic field @xmath14 , and not orthogonal to it , as in ordinary electrodynamics .",

    "we do not discuss the origin of this magnetic field , it can be an external magnetic field , though later we will see that as a consequence of the field equations axions can formally self - induce such a magnetic field at the surface of wl .",
    "we denote the distance between the two superconducting electrodes of the junction by @xmath40 , the width of the superconductors by @xmath41 and their height by @xmath42 , so that the volume of the weak link region is @xmath43 .",
    "the volume of the region where the magnetic field is present is @xmath44 , we assume @xmath45 , i.e. the magnetic field is only present near the surface of wl .",

    "@xmath50 is an oscillating current produced by entering dark matter axions coming from outside wl .",
    "what happens inside wl will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the main difference between axions in vacuum and axions in a jj is that in a jj there is the possibility that electric currents are supercurrents , i.e. they manifest themselves in form of cooper pairs that tunnel the weak - link region .",
    "this possibility is also open to electric currents induced by dark matter axions in a magnetic field .",
    "the main assumption in the following is that the oscillating current ( [ 8 ] ) manifests itself as a supercurrent in the jj .",
    "this means we can write for @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 can be regarded as an axion - generated critical current in the junction , and the phase @xmath54 grows linearly inside wl .",
    "note that @xmath55 has different behavior for @xmath56 wl and @xmath57 wl .",
    "we will later see what the physical interpretation of this is ( in fact inside wl the axion will decay immediately so that the phase @xmath58 will get the meaning of an ordinary electromagnetic phase ) . at the moment",
    "we just do the maths , i.e. regard @xmath58 as a solution of the equations and come to the physical interpretation later .",
    "equality between eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) implies that inside wl the variable @xmath58 evolves in a different way than outside wl , namely , we have inside wl @xmath59 and @xmath60 apparently , coincidence of the electric currents ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) produced in a small vicinity inside and outside wl requires that the angle variable @xmath54 switches from harmonic oscillations to linearly increasing behavior modulo @xmath61 when entering wl , still with the same frequency @xmath62 . note that the phase difference @xmath8 of the jj anyway increases linearly in time , i.e. @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the josephson frequency , since the jj is in a driven voltage stage @xcite .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) can be neglected , and eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) reduces to @xmath70 ( if condition ( [ cond ] ) is not satisfied then there will be an additional oscillating component to the @xmath71-field , otherwise the argumentation is very similar . )",
    "the linear increase @xmath72 inside wl due to eq .",
    "( [ here ] ) thus formally induces an axion - generated magnetic field @xmath14 via eq .",
    "( [ there ] ) .",
    "using @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the external voltage applied to the jj , as well as using the resonance condition @xmath75 between axion mass and josephson frequency @xmath76 ( which can be achieved by suitably choosing @xmath74 ) we get from eq .",
    "( [ there ] ) @xmath77 we have thus found a nontrivial solution of the field equations ( [ 1])([4 ] ) where there is an axion - generated magnetic field ( in the direction of the bias current ) given by ( [ 13 ] ) due to the existence of supercurrents .",
    "depending on what is assumed for @xmath12 , this can be a huge magnetic field ( see @xcite for some numerical examples ) , but it is penetrating only through a tiny surface area @xmath49 so that the flux is reasonably sized .    to properly describe axion electrodynamics in a jj , we also need to take into account the probability of axion decay in a strong magnetic field . from the primakov effect one",
    "has for the decay probability of axions in a magnetic field of strength @xmath71",

    "this suggests to use for the area @xmath85 in equation ( [ 11 ] ) the value @xmath49 , where @xmath81 is given by ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "putting eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) a remarkable simplification takes place and one finally ends up with the simple formula @xmath86 note that physically unmeasurable quantities like the formal huge magnetic field concentrated in a tiny surface area as well as the unknown constant @xmath12 have all dropped out , and the critical current @xmath53 is basically determined by the dark matter axion velocity @xmath46 relative to the junction and the axionic dark matter density near the earth @xmath35 , as well as the fundamental constants @xmath87 , @xmath18 and @xmath88 ( the charge of cooper pairs ) .",
    "a linearly increasing phase in ordinary jj physics means tunneling cooper pairs and emission of josephson radiation @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , if the axion is still assumed to be present in wl , then a linearly increasing phase @xmath89 implies the existence of a huge magnetic field given by eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) . alone for energetic reasons , such a huge field can not be present in the junction .",
    "the only sensible conclusion is that the axion immediately decays when entering the junction , it tunnels the junction @xcite",
    ". if the axion is still present in wl , then the huge magnetic field induced by ( [ 13 ] ) will make it decay immediately .",
    "if the axion is not present in wl , then there is no huge magnetic field , and hence no energetic problem with that field . during the tunneling process",
    "the phase @xmath54 just gets the meaning of an ordinary electromagnetic phase in the junction , which obeys standard type of squid physics @xcite .",
    "the tunneling axion still produces a measurable effect due to an additional contribution to the critical current given by ( [ ic1 ] ) .    in calculating this critical current , all singular ( unmeasurable ) quantities such as the huge formal magnetic field",
    "have dropped out .",
    "we used the formal magnetic field mainly as a mathematical tool to calculate the axion - generated effects in wl from the field equations . in experiments",
    "one should look for a small peak - like structure of the differential conductance at a particular voltage @xmath74 , produced by the increase in the critical current .",
    "this voltage satisfies @xmath90 . putting into eq .",
    "( [ ic1 ] ) typical numbers for the estimated density @xmath35 and velocity @xmath46 of dark matter axions in the galactic halo relative to the earth one sees that the predicted contribution of axions to the critical current is small but perfectly measurable , of the order of @xmath91a .",
    "our physical interpretation of the linearly increasing phase @xmath54 is that the axions passing through wl decay via josephson radiation , triggering at the same time additional cooper pairs to flow .",
    "these additional cooper pairs yield a small but measurable effect if @xmath65 .    in a recent preprint @xcite it was proposed that axions can have different interactions with cooper pairs in a superconductor than in the vacuum case , possibly stronger ones , since electron number is not conserved .",
    "this is in line with the ideas presented here : in our consideration presented here and in @xcite , incoming axions decay into microwave photons and trigger at the same time the process of cooper pairs forming out of ordinary electrons , thus producing additional supercurrents in the voltage - biased junction .",
    "the ( maximum ) additional critical current @xmath53 as allowed by axion electrodynamics is given by ( [ ic1 ] ) .",
    "this critical current @xmath53 is derived from the axion field equation ( [ 2 ] ) and is a current of ordinary cooper pairs through an ordinary electromagnetic weak link ; it is not related to the existence or non - existence of a possible weak link in peccei - quinn symmetry as discussed in @xcite .    in topological superconductors",
    "@xcite , superconducting phases couple to electromagnetic fields with an axionic topological coupling , and chiral vortex lines can be josephson junctions .",
    "the corresponding field theory was developed in @xcite .",
    "axions can also induce nonlinear modulations of the electromagnetic field in topological insulators @xcite .",
    "generally it is to be expected that axionic dark matter is much more likely to leave a detectable signal in complex systems of condensed matter physics than in vacuum .",
    "coming back to the simple case of axions passing through wl of a jj , as with any critical current , @xmath53 represents the _ maximum _ electric supercurrent one can expect to see due to axionic dark matter passing through the junction , an idealized situation , as allowed by the classical field equations . in practice",
    ", the current will often be smaller , depending on the experimental situation and the geometry of the josephson junction used . to work this out further ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath92 the surface area of wl perpendicular to axion flow , which for orthogonally entering axions is given by @xmath93 .",
    "so far we did mainly do classical axion electrodynamics .",
    "but one also needs to take into account the particle nature of axions and cooper pairs .",
    "following the ideas of @xcite , we may assume that each axion entering wl triggers the flow of @xmath94 cooper pairs ( fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "in an s / n / s junction @xmath94 is related to the number of andreev reflections and given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the gap energy of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "the maximum observable supercurrent is constrained by the geometry of the jj and given by the number of axions hitting the wl region of surface area @xmath92 per time unit , multiplied by @xmath97 : @xmath98 for an optimum s / n / s axion detector , both formulas ( [ ic1 ] ) and ( [ ic2 ] ) should be valid , i.e. @xmath99 . by equating them we obtain @xmath100 the right - hand side is just determined by astrophysical dark matter properties , whereas the left - hand side yields a relation for the detecting jj experiment . for the aluminium junction used by hoffmann et al .",
    "@xcite , one can readily check that condition ( [ dn ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this experiment thus provides an optimum axion detector .",
    "if one wants to use other s / n / s josephson junction , say with a higher gap energy @xmath96 , then naturally @xmath40 must be chosen smaller .",
    "for the dark matter parameters advocated in @xcite , one obtains a characteristic length scale of @xmath101 .",
    "let us now discuss the experimental consequences of our theory . as previously discussed in @xcite , the decaying axions produce photons and these produce small axion - induced shapiro steps , which are measurable for junctions with sufficiently large @xmath92 .",
    "the main shapiro step occurs at a voltage given by @xmath102 , other integer multiples of @xmath103 may also occur if the axion - induced cooper pair flow intensity is high .",
    "the typical step size should be given by eq .",
    "( [ ic2 ] ) .",
    "first , let us discuss hoffmann et al.s experiment @xcite , based on al - cu - al s / n / s junctions .",
    "their measurement of a shapiro step - like feature of unknown origin at @xmath104ev in @xcite was used in @xcite to estimate the axion mass as @xmath105 and the axionic dark matter density near the earth as being @xmath106 , assuming orthogonal axion flow .",
    "the velocity @xmath46 of axions traveling through the jj was assumed to be given by the value @xmath107 ( the velocity of the earth relative to the galactic halo ) .",
    "let us now look at other experiments as well . in the experiment of golikova et al .",
    "@xcite , based on al-(cu / fe)-al microbridges , a double - peak peculiarity of the measured differential resistance is observed ( fig .  4 in @xcite ) , with one rather constant peak occurring at @xmath108v , whereas the other peak position near 75@xmath26v is dependent on the length of the sample and the applied magnetic field .",
    "a possible interpretation would be to interpret the first ( universal ) peak as coming from axions and the second peak as being due to a minigap produced by the proximity effect .",
    "further measurements are needed to check this .",
    "@xcite use w - au - w s / n / s junctions and report the observation of a large number of fractional shapiro steps without externally applied microwave radiation .",
    "most shapiro steps occur in the temperature region 2.8 - 3.2k , and for this temperature region the strongest steps occur at @xmath109v ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) , which is again the axion voltage @xmath103 . since the wolfram superconductors used by he et al .",
    "have a gap energy @xmath96 that is larger by a factor 5 as compared to the aluminium superconductors used in @xcite and @xcite , the number of andreev reflections @xmath94 given in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) is larger , and hence a higher intensity of cooper pair flow is induced by the incoming axions .",
    "this may be the reason that a larger number of observable shapiro steps is excited in this experiment .",
    "in addition , the minigap structure created by the proximity effect may create further shapiro steps in this junction .    finally let us discuss another experiment performed by bae et al.@xcite , which is quite different from the previous ones , in the sense that a high-@xmath110 superconductor is used , and that there is also some external forcing with microwaves with a given frequency @xmath111 .",
    "bae et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the occurence of shapiro steps when irradiating a micron - sized sample of bi-2212 , a high-@xmath110 crystal , which contains a stack of about @xmath112 intrinsic tunnel josephson junctions .",
    "the superconducting layers of this crystal are separated by @xmath113 nm from each other .",
    "the sample used by bae et al . had width @xmath114 m , hence in total the area of the wl region is given by @xmath115 .",
    "this effective area is large enough to produce measurable axion - induced currents via eq .",
    "( [ ic2 ] ) . from  ( [ ic2 ] )",
    "one obtains the prediction @xmath116 @xmath117 if @xmath118 and @xmath119 gev/@xmath2 is used .",
    "bae et al .",
    "@xcite irradiated their probe by external microwave radiation of frequency @xmath120 5ghz , 13 ghz , 18 ghz , 23ghz , and 26 ghz , respectively .",
    "note that 26 ghz @xmath121 .",
    "for all values of @xmath111 they observed well - pronounced integer shapiro steps at voltages @xmath122 given by @xmath123 , as expected from the rsj model @xcite , with @xmath124 integer .",
    "however , two unexplained peculiarities occured ( see fig .  1 , data from @xcite ) :    \\1 . while for @xmath125 ghz only the usual integer shapiro steps were observed , at the frequency @xmath126 ghz also one additional fractional shapiro step is seen , formally with @xmath127 ( see fig .",
    "this unusual step occurs at a voltage @xmath128v , and the step size is ( for increasing voltage ) 16.4 na .",
    "while in principle fractional shapiro steps are possible due to non - sinusoidal contributions in the current - phase relation , it is very unusual to have only one such step ( there is none at e.g.  @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and also none for the other values of @xmath111 ) .",
    "our physical interpretation is that this unusual step is due to axion flow through the junction and that it is stabilized due to the commensurate ratio @xmath131 .",
    "the observed step size 16.4na agrees with what is expected from eq .",
    "( [ ic2 ] ) .    \\2 .",
    "while for @xmath125 ghz basically all low-@xmath124 integer shapiro steps are observed , for @xmath132 ghz only odd-@xmath124 shapiro steps are seen ( @xmath133 ) whereas the even-@xmath124 shapiro steps @xmath134 are suppressed , so that the voltage difference between neighbored steps is @xmath128v rather than the expected 27@xmath26v ( see fig .",
    "due to these double - voltage steps the pattern looks much more similar to a pattern generated by a ( phase - shifted ) frequency of 26 ghz rather than one of 13 ghz .",
    "our physical interpretation is that at even @xmath124 the axion - generated shapiro steps fall onto the ordinary ones generated by the frequency @xmath111 and can compensate them , provided they have the same magnitude but opposite sign .",
    "the observed zero - crossing step sizes for @xmath135 are indeed 16.4 na , which would allow for such a destructive interference .    in summary ,",
    "all four experiments mentioned contain peculiar josephson resonance effects associated with the voltage @xmath136v , pointing towards an axion mass of @xmath137ev , where we base our error estimate on the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additional experimental tests are of course still needed .",
    "a typical axion shapiro step is predicted to exhibit small daily and yearly periodic oscillations in intensity , similar as in searches for wimps @xcite .",
    "the daily oscillations are expected to come from the fact that the galactic axion flow relative to the earth is directed , the earth rotates but axions produce the strongest signal if they enter the junction transversally .",
    "we also emphasize that it is clearly important to extend the search range of other axion search experiments , which are _ not _ based on jjs , to the mass region suggested by jjs , @xmath138ev .",
    "a recent experimental proposal in this direction is @xcite .",
    "let us finally discuss the cosmological consequences of an axion mass value of 0.11mev that the experiments discussed in the previous section seem to favor .",
    "this value implies that the peccei - quinn symmetry was broken _",
    "after _ the end of inflation @xcite , at least in the simplest models of cosmological axion production . based on the results of @xcite ( assuming that axions make up all dark matter ) , the mass value @xmath139ev translates into an axion coupling constant of @xmath140gev , a freeze - out temperature of @xmath141 mev , and for the fractional contribution @xmath4 to the cosmic axion density from decays of axionic strings and walls we obtain from the formula @xmath142 derived in @xcite the prediction @xmath5 .    generally , the rather high energy scale of inflation that seems to be indicated by the recent bicep2 results @xcite puts a lower bound on the qcd axion mass of about 70@xmath26ev @xcite .",
    "if production of axions from axionic strings is taken into account as well @xcite , then this lower bound still becomes sharper : shellard et al .",
    "derive in @xcite for the axion coupling constant @xmath143 gev , which is equivalent to @xmath144ev . on the other hand",
    ", the axion mass can not be too big because otherwise one would violate various astrophysical observational constraints .",
    "for example , the sn1987a supernovae data imply a lower bound on @xmath11 given approximately by @xmath145 gev @xcite , equivalent to @xmath146mev . in @xcite",
    "an even stronger upper bound is derived if quantum fluctuations during inflation are taken into account , @xmath147mev .",
    "a recent analysis of galactic rotation curves @xcite based on an axionic bose - einstein condensate as dark matter is consistent with this range of an axion mass between 0.1 and 1mev , as well as with estimates of the axionic dark matter density in the halo as calculated in @xcite .",
    "overall , it appears that the mass value @xmath148mev that is suggested by the josephson resonances fits very well into the mass range expected from cosmological and astrophysical considerations after bicep2 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed derivation why axions can generate small measurable electric currents in josephson junctions .",
    "we started from the field equations of axion electrodynamics , plus the assumption that the axion - induced electric current can manifest itself as a supercurrent in a josephson junction .",
    "we found a nontrivial solution of the axion field equations in the weak - link region of the junction , for which the phase grows linearly in time .",
    "this was interpreted in terms of axions decaying via josephson radiation and triggering at the same time additional cooper pair flow through the junction .",
    "a huge formal magnetic field appeared in our calculations , making the axions decay if they are still present at the surface of the junction , but the final result for the axion - generated additional critical current @xmath53 as given by eq .",
    "( [ ic1 ] ) is actually independent of the precise value of this formal @xmath14-field , as it drops out of the equations .",
    "overall the effect of the galactic axion background is small but measurable and the decaying axions produce a small shapiro step - like feature when the axion mass resonates with the josephson frequency .",
    "we derived concrete formulas for the additional critical current @xmath53 generated by axion flow , and derived conditions for different types of josephson junctions to act as optimum axion detectors .",
    "the measured voltage where axion - generated shapiro steps occur can be used to estimate the axion mass @xmath10 , and their intensity can be used to estimate the axionic dark matter density @xmath35 near the earth @xcite .",

    "<S> recently it has been proposed that dark matter axions from the galactic halo can produce a small shapiro step - like signal in josephson junctions whose josephson frequency resonates with the axion mass [ c. beck , prl 111 , 231801 ( 2013 ) ] . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the axion field equations in a voltage - driven josephson junction environment allow for a nontrivial solution where the axion - induced electrical current manifests itself as an oscillating supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> the linear change of phase associated with this nontrivial solution implies the formal existence of a large magnetic field in a tiny surface area of the weak link region of the junction which makes incoming axions decay into microwave photons . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a condition for the design of josephson junction experiments so that they can act as optimum axion detectors . </S>",
    "<S> four independent recent experiments are discussed in this context . </S>",
    "<S> the observed shapiro step anomalies of all four experiments consistently point towards an axion mass of @xmath0ev . </S>",
    "<S> this mass value is compatible with the recent bicep2 results and implies that peccei - quinn symmetry breaking was taking place after inflation . </S>"
