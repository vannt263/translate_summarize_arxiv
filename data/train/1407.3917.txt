    "the higher - order singularities originate from a delicate balance of inner and outer shell of the potential : in between the higher - order singularities , the two contact values in the pair distribution functions @xmath98 cause a beating in the static structure factor which gives rise to a strong enough additional contribution in the mct vertex to trigger a line of glass - glass transition with endpoint singularities .",

    "the iso - dynamics lines do not extend all the way towards the higher - order singularities since at the higher - order singularities the dynamics is modified significantly from its well - known behavior by the critical exponents changing rapidly over a very narrow region of control parameters @xcite . in between , the critical exponents @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( the mct exponent parameter @xmath103 ) , have a broad maximum ( minimum ) .",
    "hence , a generic reason for the iso - dynamics lines can be identified in the presence of two symmetric mct endpoint singularities : the short - time dynamics is unaffected by the presence of glass transitions and is therefore similar if the variation of the statics structure factors is small .",
    "the dynamics affected by the glass transitions experience especially little variation in the region of invariant dynamics since the variation of the critical parameters are restricted as explained above .",
    "within the mct calculations it could be shown that the higher - order singularities originate from the competition of different wave - vector regimes in the static structure factor @xmath104 where a beating phenomenon reflects the influence of inner and outer shell @xcite . to support the conclusions drawn above within the mct picture we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : beating ] the static structure factor for the big particles : the contributions above the regular decay of @xmath105 for @xmath104 towards its large-@xmath56 limit of 0.5 are clearly seen to exhibit beating with a frequency characteristic of the distance of the two shells , @xmath106 .",
    "this beating frequency is observed most clearly between @xmath107 and 45 while mixing effects may interfere at yet larger wave vectors and obscure the visibility of the beating . finding the beating phenomenon in a region where also mct effects regarding the higher - order singularities",

    "<S> this result provides ( i ) one of the most stringent test of previously formulated mct predictions ( ii ) evidence that soft - colloidal particles could constitute a model system for experimentally testing these highly unconventional behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we unexpectedly discovered that the competition between two higher - order singularities gives rise to a non - trivial iso - dynamics in between the two singularities . </S>",
    "<S> such state points share the same dynamics at all time and length - scales . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our study will stimulate the experimental search for anomalous dynamics and competing glass transitions in core - softened systems and in repulsive systems with two competing length scales .    </S>",
