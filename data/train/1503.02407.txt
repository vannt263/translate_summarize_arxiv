    "there is compelling evidence that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this indicates some new physics at cosmological scales (  dark energy \" ) @xcite that can give rise to repulsive gravity resulting the universe to accelerate .",
    "the cosmological constant with @xmath11 is the simplest example of repulsive gravity and is consistent with the majority of cosmological observations .",
    "but the observational data at present is also consistent with dark energy behavior which is strictly not constant but evolves slowly throughout the cosmological history .",
    "moreover the cosmological constant comes with its own baggage of problems like cosmic coincidence problem which can be avoided using dynamical dark energy .",
    "scalar fields are the most widely used dynamical dark energy models where late time acceleration can be obtained by adjusting the slope of the scalar field potential around suitable epoch @xcite .",
    "but the cosmological evolution of these models is severely constrained by very accurate cosmological observations . from the measurements of temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "radiation , the distance to last scattering is very well determined .",
    "this restricts the equation of state for the scalar field to be very close to @xmath12 at present .",
    "the type - ia supernovae observations as well as baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement in the large scale structures also give similar constraint on the scalar field equation of state . on the other hand cmb measurements",
    "also restricts the scalar field contribution to the total energy density of the universe during recombination to be less than @xmath13 .",
    "all these constraints disfavor @xcite the original  tracker \" kind of quintessence model@xcite where the scalar field initially has a fast roll phase before settling to the cosmological constant behavior at present . just recently ,",
    "analysis of the spectrum from a distant quasar finds no evidence of deviation in molecular lines produced around 12 billion years ago .",
    "this confirms no change in the mass ratio of the proton to the electron .",
    "the results also indicate that a dark energy scalar field  if it exists  has not evolved appreciably over @xmath14 the age of the universe @xcite , thereby putting doubt on the tracker kind of models as a possible candidate for dark energy .",
    "the other scalar field behavior that is consistent with the present observational data is the  thawing \" one @xcite .",
    "currently there are many types of scalar field models that can give rise to thawing behavior .",
    "examples are quintessence @xcite , tachyons @xcite as well as galileon @xcite models . in all these thawing models ,",
    "the thawing nature does not depend crucially on the form of the potential .",
    "once the initial conditions are chosen in such way that the scalar field starts in a nearly frozen state with @xmath15 , the thawing behavior is ensured .",
    "fine tuning this initial condition is an issue in all thawing type of models . in a recent investigation",
    ", attempt has been made to relate this initial condition to inflationary dynamics @xcite .",
    "given the fact that thawing models are observationally promising as a possible candidate for dynamical dark energy models , we need to have a combined setup to investigate the cosmological evolution for different thawing scalar field models . in this work ,",
    "we present such a setup in a python environment .",
    "we name this setup as  scalpy \" which solves the autonomous system with a given scalar field model by providing suitable initial conditions and calculates the observables like normalized hubble parameter , angular diameter distance , luminosity distance , growth function , growth rate , linear matter power spectrum etc .",
    "we consider two simple potentials , the power - law and exponential for all the different versions of the scalar fields as these are the two most widely used potentials for dark energy in the literature .",
    "but one can easily incorporate the other potentials in this package .",
    "we also combine the package with the publicly available mcmc sampler  emcee \" @xcite to do the statistical analysis of different scalar fields with observational data .    given the promise of thawing scalar field models as possible candidate for the dark energy , there are several investigations related to the thawing model for different types of scalar field .",
    "all these works are related to individual scalar field models and there are not many attempts to study the different thawing scalar field model in a combined approach .",
    "this is the first such combined approach in python environment .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we describe the autonomous system of equations for different scalar field models and also the method to fix the initial conditions to solve these systems ; in section iii , we describe different cosmological observable that scalpy calculates for different scalar field models ; in section iv , we describe different data sets that are used to put observational constraints on different models and the results of the data analysis ; finally we summarizes our results in the conclusion section . in the appendix part of the manuscript",
    ", we briefly describe how to install and to use scalpy .",
    "in the present investigation , we confine ourselves to flat frw universe with scale factor @xmath16 and given by the line element    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "the scale factor at present is set to be @xmath19 . in the late time evolution of the universe ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the energy budget of the universe is from the non - relativistic matter ( baryons+dark matter ) and from the dark energy . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in studying various forms of scalar field models as the dark energy component in the universe",
    "..    in following subsection we will look at quintessence , tachyon and galileon fields and see how we make autonomous systems in these frameworks .",
    "we consider a minimally coupled scalar field and lagrangian for such a field is given by @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the given potential .",
    "one can calculate the energy momentum tensor and by considering perfect fluid , the energy density and pressure of quintessence field is given by @xmath22 the equation of motion for scalar field obtained by variation of action with respect to field @xmath23 is @xmath24    where the subscript @xmath23 denotes the derivative with respect to field @xmath23 .",
    "the hubble equation is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the total density of matter and scalar field .",
    "we define the variables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 as @xcite    @xmath30    here the prime denote the derivative with respect to the e - folding @xmath31",

    "we choose @xmath67 to be a parameter of the model .",
