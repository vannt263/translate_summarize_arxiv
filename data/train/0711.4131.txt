    "high luminosity carbon stars have high mass loss rates @xcite which would be sufficient to power the ulx .    however , the optical emission could also be dominated by reprocessed x - rays on the companion star or on the accretion disk , or by the intrinsic emission of the disk . in these cases ,",
    "spectral classification of the companion star via its colors is not reliable .",
    "we discuss these possibilities in following .    assuming the x - ray emission is isotropic , the x - ray luminosity intercepted by the companion is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the radius of the companion star",
    ", @xmath91 is the binary separation , and @xmath92 is the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "the high luminosity of ulxs indicate that they accrete via roche - lobe overflow . substituting equation  ( 2 ) in @xcite in which @xmath93 is determined by the companion to compact object mass ratio @xmath94 to an accuracy better than 1% for any @xmath94",
    ", we have @xmath95 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\ ] ] a plot of @xmath96 versus @xmath94 at different x - ray luminosities is presented in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "we can see that for a source like ic  342 x-1 , which has @xmath97  , the companion intercepted x - ray luminosity is above @xmath98  @xmath99 when @xmath100 and above @xmath101  @xmath99 when @xmath102 .",
    "these luminosities are as high as of massive main sequence stars , bright giants or supergiants , implying that the optical counterpart of a bright ulx will appear as bright as a massive star or giant / supergiant no matter what the companion really is .",
    "the observed optical spectra suggest star a has a luminosity of about @xmath101  @xmath99 , and star b has a luminosity of about @xmath98 to @xmath101  @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the optical emission may well be dominated by an x - ray `` heated '' companion star . however ,",
    "how much of the companion surface is shielded by the accretion disk is unknown .",
    "for ulxs with @xmath103  , if even a small portion ( @xmath104 ) of the x - ray flux is not absorbed enroute to the companion surface , then the companion s temperature and luminosity will be notably raised .     in unit of solar luminosity ) as a function of the binary mass ratio ( @xmath94 , the companion to compact object mass ratio ) , assuming isotropic emission and roche - lobe overflowing .",
    "different lines are scaled with different x - ray luminosity as labeled .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ]    disk irradiation may be an important component of the optical emission if the x - ray luminosity is truly very high .",
    "gris et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) found significant variability from the optical counterpart of ngc  1313 x-2 on time scales from days to hours and even minutes , suggesting the optical emission is dominated by x - ray reprocessing .",
    "both star a and star b show no detectable variability in the four f625w images at time scales of a few hours .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio taking either star a or b as the counterpart is consistent with those found in neutron - star and stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries ( the low mass x - ray binaries ; lmxbs ) , where the emission is thought to be dominated by reprocessed x - rays on the disk @xcite .",
    "however , the color of either star is significantly redder than the colors , @xmath105 , typical of lmxbs . assuming a standard disk geometry , the disk temperature from x - ray irradiation varies as @xmath106 at different radius , and the spectral energy distribution has a form of @xmath107 by integrating to infinite radius .",
    "therefore , for a finite disk , the x - ray reprocessing at the outermost radius ( @xmath108 ) determines the peak of the energy distribution , which could be attributed to a simplified blackbody emission with an effective temperature @xmath109 .",
    "we assume the disk size is scaled with the binary separation @xmath91 , so the effective temperature of the heated disk varies as @xmath110 .",
    "if the system transfers mass via roche - lobe overflow , then @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the compact object mass , @xmath113 is the orbital period and we have assumed that the companion mass is less than that of the compact object , also the companion density varies as @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath115 . for most galactic lmxbs ,",
    "the companion is a main sequence star with a density in order of @xmath116 and the @xmath109 of the heated disk is around 25,00030,000  k , or @xmath105 . to produce a heated disk with a @xmath109 around 5,5006,000  k as star a at a high x - ray luminosity level",
    ", it requires either an imbh or an well evolved companion that has a low density .",
    "if the optical counterpart is star b , whose optical spectral index is much steeper than @xmath117 , it is unlikely that the optical emission is dominated by disk irradiation .",
    "parenthetically , we note that the relation found by @xcite between the visual luminosity @xmath118 , x - ray luminosity , and orbital period of lmxbs has been used to make inferences about the orbital periods of ulxs .",
    "this relation was based mainly on sources with relatively dense companions , and the correlation is inferred based on the assumption that @xmath119 , which is no longer correct when @xmath120  k. therefore , one should be cautious in applying this correlation in systems where the observed @xmath109 is lower than 25,00030,000  k , or @xmath55 is higher than 0 .",
    "the intrinsic disk emission in the optical band should present in a form of @xmath121 , which is totally different with the observed optical spectra .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the optical emission is not dominated by the viscous disk .    in sum , for a ulx system with @xmath103  , it appears unlikely that the intrinsic emission of the companion star dominates the optical emission .",
    "the companion star is likely significantly heated by x - ray illumination .",
    "disk irradiation could also be important .",
    "the color of the optical counterpart is redder than typically found in systems , such as lmxbs , where a significant fraction of the optical light arises from an x - ray heated disk .",
    "the red color could be a consequence of a massive black hole or a low density companion ."
