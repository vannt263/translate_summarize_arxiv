    "quantum wells are a fundamental and well - studied type of man - made semiconductor nanostructure @xcite",
    ". they can exhibit remarkable transport phenomena and their optical properties have motivated intense basic research and numerous applications . in particular , intersubband transitions ,",
    "that is , light - induced transitions between states of a given energy band belonging to different subbands , have been extensively studied and successfully applied to the development of infrared lasers and detectors @xcite . in parallel to these developments in the area of semiconductor nanoscience and technology , a new branch of optics developed vigorously in the last twenty years , namely , the study of phase - structured light @xcite . the generation and applications of _ twisted light _ ( tl ) , or light beams carrying _ orbital _ angular momentum , gained great attention after the seminal work of allen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the interaction of tl with mesoscopic particles ( optical tweezers ) @xcite , atoms and molecules @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite has been studied recently .",
    "other issues , like the theoretical description of cavity - qed of tl @xcite and the use of tl for potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite have also been addressed @xcite .",
    "the interaction of tl with solid - state systems thus appears as a promising field of research and technology .",
    "a number of basic situations have recently been investigated theoretically @xcite , but fewer experimental studies have been reported thus far @xcite . in this article",
    "we initiate the study of intersubband transitions induced by tl beams in semiconductor quantum wells . besides considering the intersubband excitation with tl",
    ", we focus on a special geometry that has not received much attention thus far : by taking advantage of the fact that collimated laser beams posses a component of the electric field along the propagation direction , we propose the excitation of intersubband transitions at normal incidence without using gratings . thus , collimated beams of tl bring about two nonstandard ingredients to intersubband transitions : new selection rules based on the conservation of the spin and _ orbital _ angular momentum , and the possibility of excitation at normal incidence .",
    "let us consider a tl beam with a radial dependence of the bessel type and circular polarization @xmath0 . in the coulomb gauge ( @xmath1 ) its vector potential in the paraxial approximation",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath2 + c.c .",

    "the light s",
    "orbital angular momentum is given by the integer @xmath6 .",
    "when optical transitions can be excited by both the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 components of the light s electric field , the @xmath8-component of the vector potential is normally neglected since usually @xmath9 . on the other hand , there are experimental situations where the component of the field in the plane of the absorbing material ( @xmath7-plane ) can not induce quantum transitions due to symmetry restrictions while the @xmath8-component can .",
    "this is the case of intersubband transitions in quantum - well and quantum - disk structures at normal incidence , which is the situation we focus on here .",
    "moreover , advances in optical hyperlenses suggest that highly collimated beams ( with large @xmath10 ) can be obtained @xcite . optical transitions induced by the @xmath7-component of the tl beam in bulk @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , and quantum dots",
    "@xcite have been studied recently .",
    "in order to model the semiconductor quantum well in a convenient and flexible way we consider a cylindrical disk of height @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 . the limit of @xmath13 describes the infinite quasi - two - dimensional quantum well system , and the finite @xmath12 case will allow us to do numerical modeling with realistic beam and nanostructure parameters .",
    "note that the chosen cylindrical geometry is convenient from a mathematical and conceptual point of view , given the cylindrical nature of the beam @xcite .",
    "we have in mind standard quantum wells made of , for example , gaalas @xcite . with hard - wall confinement ,",
    "the envelope - function eigenstates of the cylindrical disk are given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the @xmath17-th zero of the bessel function @xmath18 , @xmath19 the subband index , and the normalization constant @xmath20 the eigen - energies are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the effective electron mass in the band under consideration .",
    "the intersubband transitions are governed by the matrix elements of the electron - tl interaction , @xmath23 , whose matrix elements @xmath24 need to be worked out ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electron charge and bare mass , respectively ) .",
    "it can be easily shown that , under normal incidence , the @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of the vector potential do not contribute to the matrix elements for intersubband processes ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "intrasubband transitions are stronlgy supressed by the smallness of their light - matter matrix elements ( between  in - plane \" single - particle states ) . also , considering typical intersubband frequencies of @xmath30 , both intrasubband single - particle excitations and surface plamons are completely off - resonance .",
    "thus , intrasubband effects can be safely ignored here . for the component @xmath31 we obtain from the linear term of the interaction @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 the factor @xmath35 has been obtained under the dipole moment approximation ( applied only in the @xmath8-direction ) , @xmath36 , which is amply justified in our system . for transitions between subbands 1 and 2 , we have @xmath37 . within the same dipole approximation ,",
    "the quadratic term is proportional to @xmath38 and therefore drops out for intersubband transitions .",
    "the kronecker deltas that appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mez ] ) enforce the conservation of angular momentum . since the electron undergoes an intraband transition",
    ", there is obviously no change in the angular momentum associated with the periodic part of its bloch wave function . as a consequence",
    ", the spin angular momentum of the photon ( @xmath39 ) , which in interband transitions accounts for the change in the band angular momentum of the electron @xcite , appears now in the selection rules for the envelope function along with the photon s orbital angular momentum ( @xmath6 ) , as seen also in the study of intraband transitions in quantum rings @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of eq .   involve integrals with three bessel functions [ see eq .  ]",
    "which , to the best of our knowledge , do not admit an analytical solution and are somewhat numerically demanding .",
    "however , they can be simplified in cases of practical interest where the semiconductor structure is small compared to the beam waist .",
    "this wide - beam approximation has the advantage of keeping the interesting angular dependence of tl while simplifying the radial dependence which is not essential for our purposes .",
    "let us consider a typical quantum well with intersubband transition energy of @xmath30 .",
    "now , @xmath5 with @xmath9 implies that @xmath40 , and therefore the first zero of the beam s bessel function is at least a few hundred microns from the center of the beam .",
    "then , for a large quantum disk of a few tens of microns centered at the beam axis we can approximate the beam s bessel function by the first term of its series expansion . furthermore , according to eq .",
    ", only the values of @xmath41 ( + for absorption and - for emission ) lead to non - vanishing matrix elements",
    ". then @xmath42",
    "the matrix elements obtained in the previous section permit the calculation of the different forms of optical response of the quantum well to normally incident twisted light . equations of motion for the single - particle density matrix provide a general theoretical framework for such calculations , and can be straightforwardly obtained , in the free - carrier regime , for example from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we will examine some basic aspects of the dynamics of the photoexcited electrons and argue for the detectability of the proposed intersubband transitions .",
    "a central quantity to describe the dynamics of the photoexcited electrons is the population @xmath43 of the second subband states with quantum numbers @xmath44 . in the perturbative regime",
    "these populations can be obtained through the equations of motion that we just mentioned @xcite , or more directly via ordinary time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite . to second order in the light field and assuming a laser pulse turned on at @xmath45 one obtains for the population of the second - subband states @xmath46 }        { \\left(\\varepsilon_{2m\\nu}-\\varepsilon_{1,m-\\ell-\\sigma,\\nu'}-         \\hslash\\omega \\right)^{2 } } \\ , , \\label{eq : pop2 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the fermi distribution that gives the initial populations of the first - subband states . from this expression one",
    "obtains the fermi - golden - rule linear time dependence in the long - time limit , and for short pulses the time - dependence is quadratic .    in order to get some insight into the optical excitation and the resulting population of the second subband in the situation of small nanostructures , we have performed numerical calculations of @xmath48 in the case of @xmath49 . from eq .",
    ", one would like to understand what contributes to the population of a particular state ( @xmath50 , @xmath17 ) of the second subband . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we plot @xmath51 ( we plot @xmath51 rather than @xmath48 since it has the visual advantage of not presenting oscillations from positive to negative values ) , as a function of @xmath52 for fixed values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and two different values of @xmath50 .",
    "one immediately recognizes that there are several states @xmath52 of the first subband contributing to the second subband population .",
    "this is the main difference with the case of vertical ( one - to - one ) transitions induced by plane - waves , and has been already discussed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe a strong shift in the peak position , moving to higher values of @xmath52 for larger values of @xmath50 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot @xmath51 for a fixed value of @xmath53 and three different values of @xmath6 and @xmath50 .",
    "this figure shows that for small @xmath6 few states @xmath52 away from @xmath17 are significantly excited , resembling vertical transitions .",
    "thus , for small values of @xmath6 , it might be reasonable to simplify expression by eliminating the sum and evaluating only the term with @xmath55 .",
    "however , for increasing values of @xmath6 , more states with different @xmath52 contribute and the whole sum in eq .   should be kept . from this figure",
    "we see that there is also an @xmath6-dependent shift of the peak away from the value @xmath55 , which in our figure was chosen so as to cancel the @xmath50-induced shift .",
    "intersubband transitions are traditionally detected using relative absorbance measurements in multi - quantum - well structures @xcite .",
    "normally , the transitions are produced by the transverse component of the light s electric field at oblique incidence .",
    "it is thus worth comparing the relative strength of those transitions to our proposed normal - incidence transitions .",
    "a simple estimate can be done by comparing the ratio of the longitudinal to the perpendicular component of the vector potential given in eq .  .",
    "this ratio is given roughly by @xmath56 , which can be chosen in the laboratory fairly freely . if @xmath57 , then the population of the second subband states is roughly a hundred times smaller than in the usual scheme .",
    "given the available laser powers this reduction does not represent a significant experimental limitation .",
    "alternatively , a pump - and - probe experimental scheme would also be adequate to observe the normal - incidence photoexcitation examined here .",
    "we have briefly analyzed the viability of inducing intersubband transitions in semiconductor quantum wells at normal incidence with twisted light beams .",
    "these transitions are enabled by the component of the electric field in the propagation direction which is present in collimated beams .",
    "we obtained the matrix elements of the light - matter interaction , which display the conservation law associated to the transfer of both spin and orbital angular momentum from the light to the electrons in doped quantum wells .",
    "a simplified expression for the matrix elements , valid in the standard case of a somewhat small semiconductor system  as compared to the laser beam waist  was presented and computed numerically . using the population of the second subband to second order in the field",
    ", we argued for the feasibility of the intersubband transitions induced by twisted light at normal incidence .",
