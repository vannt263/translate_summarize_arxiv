    "the electronic structure of molecules is undoubtedly diverse and required the development of the plethora of quantum chemical methods applied today .",
    "since there is not a single ( feasible ) method that allows calculations of sufficient accuracy for an arbitrary problem , the choice of a suitable approach stands at the beginning of each quantum chemical investigation . the classification according to the degree of static electron correlation of the wave function",
    "is of particular importance .",
    "static electron correlation occurs when the wave function must be represented by more than one electronic configuration with considerable weight , while dynamic electron correlation is caused by the multitude of configurations with little weight in the total wave function .",
    "a robust diagnostic for the degree of static correlation is highly required .",
    "+ naturally , several such diagnostics were proposed to assist the selection of a suitable method for the problem under investigation . among these",
    "is the @xmath1-diagnostic,@xcite which is defined as the frobenius norm of the single - excitation amplitude vector of a coupled - cluster wave function with singles and doubles excitations divided by the square root of the number of correlated electrons .",
    "closely related is the @xmath2 diagnostic , which is based on the matrix norm of the same single - excitation amplitude vector.@xcite in addition to these diagnostics a density functional theory based diagnostic was proposed that quantifies the error introduced by the hartree ",
    "fock exchange in hybrid functionals , where it is known that hartree ",
    "fock exchange is inaccurate for multi - configurational systems.@xcite + while these definitions all rely on a single - configurational wave function ( that will be qualitatively wrong in the multi - configurational regime ) , other diagnostics are obtained from multi - configurational wave functions . among these",
    "are diagnostics based on natural orbital occupation numbers@xcite or the corresponding first - order reduced density matrix,@xcite and a diagnostic based on monte carlo configuration interaction ( ci).@xcite a comprehensive review of these diagnostics including a comparison for several critical cases can be found in ref . .",
    "+ another way to think about electron correlation is orbital entanglement derived from grand - canonical reduced density matrices.@xcite orbital entanglement is directly related to static ( or nondynamic ) correlation@xcite and permits us here to present a multi - configurational diagnostic based on these quantities .",
    "although similar attempts have already been made,@xcite we show how a modified diagnostic based on the orbital entanglement overcomes the problems of these previous definitions .",
    "we furthermore show how the evaluation of this diagnostic can be incorporated in the algorithm of our recently proposed automated selection of active orbitals @xcite and can therefore be obtained at low cost . +",
    "this article is organized as follows : we first summarize properties we demand of a multi - configurational diagnostic and show how these requirements are met by an entanglement based criterion . then",
    ", we show how this diagnostic can be easily obtained in the framework of our automated orbital selection protocol and study several critical cases .",
    "by definition , a `` diagnostic '' has to reveal the nature of a given problem ( or an aspect thereof ) such that suitable measures can be taken to solve the problem .",
    "therefore , the main requirement for a multi - configurational diagnostic is the clear identification of strong static correlation that requires a multi - configurational description .",
    "+ in this sense , well - defined limits are preferable and we require our measure to give a value of zero in the absence of electron correlation ( i.e. , when the wave function is exactly described by a single slater determinant ) and a value of one for strong static correlation . these well - defined limits facilitate the definition of a threshold value for the diagnostic below which single - configurational methods can safely be used whereas multi - configurational methods are necessary if the diagnostic gives a value above that threshold .",
    "+ if the diagnostic is meant to guide the selection of a suitable method rather than only assess the quality of an already converged calculation , its evaluation should take only a small fraction of the total computational time . that a multi - configurational diagnostic should be obtained from a qualitatively correct multi - configurational wave function ( that still includes single - configurational wave functions as limiting cases@xcite ) is an additional natural criterion .",
    "our multi - configurational diagnostic is based on the single - orbital entropy defined as@xcite @xmath3 where the @xmath4 are the eigenvalues of the one - orbital reduced density matrix for the @xmath5th orbital and @xmath6 runs over the four possible occupations in a spatial orbital basis ( doubly occupied , spin up , spin down , unoccupied ) .",
    "maximum entanglement corresponds to a situation where all occupations are equally likely ( @xmath7 for all @xmath6 ) and is therefore equal to @xmath8 .",
    "this theoretical maximum allows for a scaling of the multi - configurational diagnostic @xmath0 such that correct limits as discussed above ( 0 = no entanglement , 1 = full entanglement ) exist , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of orbitals considered for the evaluation of @xmath0 .",
    "this scaling allows us to compare the diagnostic between different active space sizes which was not the case for some previous definitions of entanglement based diagnostics.@xcite the single - orbital entropies can easily be evaluated from a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) wave function.@xcite + maximum entanglement can only be realized if the number of electrons equals the number of spatial orbitals over which they are distributed and the number of orbitals is even .",
    "it is therefore necessary to restrict the set of orbitals whose single - orbital entropies define @xmath0 to the set of most entangled orbitals of a given calculation . if no such restriction is applied ( as in ref . )",
    ", the large number of virtual orbitals will artificially lower @xmath0 because the four possible occupations can not be realized with the electrons available in the system .",
    "+ the identification of the most entangled orbitals of a given calculation is therefore crucial to define @xmath0 such that its values can be compared between different systems or orbital bases .",
    "this is also central to our recently proposed protocol for the automated selection of active orbital spaces for multi - configurational calculations.@xcite for the calculation of @xmath0 we may exploit the protocol of ref . for partially converged , qualitatively correct dmrg wave functions to identify a set strongly entangled orbitals .",
    "we then restrict the set of orbitals to fulfill the requirement that the number of electrons equals the number of orbitals and further exclude singly - occupied molecular orbitals ( somos ) in open - shell cases .",
    "this special treatment of somos is also a peculiarity of other multi - configurational diagnostics and justified by the observation that they are usually only weakly entangled.@xcite + the diagnostic @xmath0 is then evaluated from this restricted set of orbitals . within our automated selection protocol , we obtain the diagnostic for free as a byproduct of an initial , partially converged dmrg calculation with a large active space .",
    "we applied the ano - rcc basis set @xcite in its double zeta contraction in combination with the douglas - kroll - hess hamiltonian at second order @xcite in all calculations .",
    "initial orbitals were obtained with the complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) method as implemented in molcas 8 .",
    "@xcite all dmrg calculations as well as the evaluation of @xmath11 were performed with our dmrg program qcmaquis.@xcite for these calculations , we adopt the notation of ref . :",
    "dmrg[@xmath12(@xmath13)#_orbital_basis _ , where @xmath14 is the number of renormalized states , @xmath15 and @xmath10 are the number of active electrons and orbitals , respectively , and the string after the hashtag specifies the orbital basis of the dmrg - ci calculations . with cas(@xmath13)scf",
    ", we adopt a very similar notation to specify the setup of the initial orbital generation .",
    "the number of sweeps was set to twelve in all dmrg calculations and the definition of a plateau in the threshold diagrams of our automated orbital selection procedure@xcite is set to ten .",
    "when @xmath0 is evaluated for wave functions from previously published studies , we refer to the original literature for the computational setup .",
    "in many cases the limit of almost pure dynamical correlation and strong static correlation can be realized by different structures of the same molecule .",
    "a prototype is the h@xmath16 molecule , which has almost no static correlation in its equilibrium structure and becomes more and more statically correlated when the hh bond is elongated .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for the cc stretch coordinate in ethylene and the symmetric oo stretch in ozone although the degree of static correlation is higher already in the equilibrium structure of these molecules . ref . contains a diagram of the dependence of an occupation number based multi - configurational diagnostic on these stretch coordinates that we reproduce in fig.[limits ] for @xmath0 .     as a function of the hh , cc , and symmetric oo bond elongation in h@xmath16 , ethylene , and ozone , respectively .",
    "the equilibrium distances are chosen as in ref .",
    ": @xmath17   , @xmath18   , and @xmath19   .",
    "internal coordinates that were kept fixed are : @xmath20   , @xmath21hch = 117.6@xmath22 , @xmath21hcc = 121.2@xmath22 , and @xmath21ooo = 116.8@xmath22 .",
    "the lines are produced from spline fits and meant to guide the eye .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the figure shows that @xmath0 is a continuous function with increasing distances and gives the right order of multi - configurational character at the equilibrium structure of these three molecules .",
    "the data in fig.[limits ] is obtained from full - valence dmrg[500]-ci calculations with cas(2,2)-scf , cas(4,4)-scf , and cas(6,9)-scf initial orbitals for h@xmath16 , ethylene , and ozone , respectively .",
    "the limit for @xmath0 is 0.5 in the case of h@xmath16 because only two electrons are available and symmetry constraints of the molecular orbitals apply such that the theoretical limit for @xmath11 becomes @xmath23 .",
    "+      independence of the size of the molecule or the active space is another criterion to be fulfilled by a multi - configurational diagnostic . in order to show that this holds true for @xmath0",
    ", we evaluated its value for methane , propane , and pentane from full - valence dmrg[500]#cas(4,4)scf calculations .",
    "the initial four active orbitals were selected from around the fermi level ( i.e. homo-1 , homo , lumo , lumo+1 ) .",
    ".multi - configurational diagnostic @xmath0 for three alkane molecules from full - valence dmrg[500](@xmath13)#cas(4,4)scf calculations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ orbital_bases ]    the multi - configurational character is only slightly depending on the orbital basis . in table",
    "[ orbital_bases ] , the orbital bases are arranged in an increasingly optimized order and @xmath0 follows that trend by assigning an increasing multi - configurational character .",
    "this does not influence the performance of @xmath0 because the multi - configurational character is identified even for the wave function based on hartree ",
    "fock orbitals .",
    "we presented a new orbital entanglement based multi - configurational diagnostic and applied it to several critical examples .",
    "although a similar diagnostic has previously been proposed,@xcite our definition overcomes the lack of well - defined limits .",
    "it satisfies all criteria a multi - configurational diagnostic should meet , mostly by construction , as shown in the numerical examples .",
    "furthermore , it can be evaluated as a by - product of our automated orbital selection protocol.@xcite there , it even serves for the assessment of the applicability of a multi - configurational method and directly guides the choice of a computational method .",
    "the fact that this diagnostic can be evaluated from partially converged and therefore inexpensive calculations makes it attractive for routine calculations . +",
    "a multi - configurational diagnostic is not only supposed to rank wave functions according to their multi - configurational character but should also give advice if a single- or multi - configurational method is appropriate for a given calculation .",
    "this means that threshold values need to be introduced that split the range of values that @xmath0 can take into regimes that can safely be treated by a single - configurational method and those where multi - configurational methods are required .",
    "+ until today no fundamental threshold has been defined and all values suggested in the literature rely on experience .",
    "based on the results of this paper and a re - evaluation of our recent work@xcite we recommend single - configurational methods when @xmath0 is between 0 and 0.1 , whereas we advice to apply multi - configurational methods when this value lies between 0.2 and 1.0 .",
    "this leaves an undefined region between 0.1 and 0.2 , where no clear preference between the two kinds of methods can be deduced .",
    "obviously , this regime has to be handled with special care since it may contain borderline cases where single - configurational methods fail unexpectedly . in many cases , wave functions with @xmath24 may be calculated with good accuracy by both types of methods .",
    "however , in our automated selection protocol@xcite we issue an automated warning if @xmath0 should fall in that regime .",
