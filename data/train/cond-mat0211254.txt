    "it is now common knowledge that one - dimensional interacting electronic systems possess metallic phases that are fundamentally different from those of their higher - dimensional brethren , which are for most practical purposes extremely well described by adaptations and refinements of fermi liquid theory .",
    "the luttinger liquid has become the paradigm for the former systems : the quasiparticle pole is no more , and instead one finds only collective spin and charge excitations living around two fermi points . the most striking consequence of interactions are first that spin and charge excitations",
    "are not bound to one another anymore , and can thus travel at different velocities . moreover , charge fractionalization can occur , whereby `` fundamental '' quantities like the electron s charge can be split in many pieces ( for a review , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .    experimental realizations of luttinger liquids range from edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite ( in this case , a chiral luttinger liquid is found ) , quantum wires in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , and perhaps most notably in single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) @xcite .",
    "the latter can be used to perform electrical transport experiments using different geometries , for example in junctions manipulated by mechanical means @xcite .",
    "`` kinks '' in the nanotubes or crossings of nanotubes can be produced by scanning tunneling microscopes ( stm ) tips , and these in turn provide realizations of backscattering impurities embedded in a luttinger liquid or of connections through tunnel junctions .",
    "these junctions can act as rectifying diodes at room temperature , thus opening up a route towards the construction of nanoscale devices of all sorts .",
    "an example of recently proposed applications is that of an `` entangler '' , whereby two nanotubes coupled to a superconductor are expected to produce physically separated entangled pairs of excitations @xcite .",
    "single impurities embedded in luttinger liquids have attracted a lot of theoretical interest since the early work of kane and fisher @xcite .",
    "in particular , many approaches have been devised based on boundary conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite and boundary integrability @xcite .",
    "the trick here is to `` fold '' the system around the impurity , thereby replacing it with an effective boundary whose effects scale either to the weak- or strong - coupling regime depending on the nature of the bulk interactions in the system .",
    "for example , for a backscattering impurity in a luttinger liquid , repulsive interactions enhance the backscattering amplitude , and therefore suppress the conductance .",
    "another extremely interesting situation to consider is that of a luttinger liquid on a finite interval . this class of problems is a form of generalization of the previous single impurity ones , in the sense that we now have two different boundaries to deal with .",
    "one thus imagines electrons being trapped by either a direct physical cut of their support ( maybe an ended nanotube ) , or prevented from propagating further by the presence of an excitation gap , maybe a superconducting gap , or voltage gates .",
    "we consider here the problem of a josephson junction realized by bridging two superconductors with either quantum wires or carbon nanotubes .",
    "experimental attempts at realizing this device can be found in @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this problem has been addressed in @xcite , where the josephson current for `` perfect '' contacts was computed ( here , by perfect , we mean a contact such that only andreev reflection occurs ; a poor contact would be one such that most of the reflection processes that occur would be normal reflection ones ) .",
    "a perturbative analysis of the problem was presented in @xcite , and an effective model amenable to boundary cft was used in @xcite . for certain cases ,",
    "the problem is an integrable quantum field theory , and this was treated in @xcite .",
    "however , only one particular ( nontrivial ) value of the interaction parameter can be fully solved , the others leading to rather tedious complications with the analytical properties of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , which are yet to be fully resolved . one common factor of all these studies , however , is that they were devoted to single - channel luttinger liquids .    in the case of nanotubes ,",
    "the number of channels available for conduction is however by construction greater than one .",
    "moreover , if one wants to describe interesting devices like the entangler mentioned above , or maybe even things like multiwall carbon nanotubes @xcite , it is important to have a theory for multichannel situations .",
    "it is very tempting to think that the one - dimensionality of the system opens the way to a full nonperturbative solution of transport problems of this class , as it can do for the single - channel case .",
    "however , from basic factorized scattering arguments , it is possible to show @xcite that multichannel theories nontrivially coupled only at boundaries but not in the bulk , do not seem to have enough flexibility to be integrable ( that is , only a trivial scattering matrix can satisfy the bootstrap equations ) .",
    "this holds , of course , if one considers having no boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "relaxing this might lead to some other integrable theories , but not ones which can be directly applied to the problem at hand .",
    "one is therefore ultimately led straight back into the domain of perturbative computations as the only fully controllable approach , and most of what we will present here shall be based on a minimal use of it ( that is , we solve all that we can exactly , using perturbation theory only when strictly needed ) .",
    "our plan is therefore to treat the general problem of a conducting multichannel system in a finite size domain , between two boundaries having nontrivial effects on the physics ( but no independent degrees of freedom of their own ) .",
    "the noninteracting and interacting cases are treated in fundamentally different manners . the noninteracting problem is straightforward to solve thoroughly directly in the fermionic language , providing in some sense an adaptation of the well - known work of blonder , tinkham and klapwijk @xcite to two - boundary problems .",
    "the partition function can be computed exactly , which means that thermodynamic properties and correlation functions can be obtained exactly ( for the case of correlation functions , we only solve the interacting case , since the noninteracting ones can be recovered easily by putting all interaction parameters to zero ) .    including interactions ,",
    "however , takes us to a different set of problems .",
    "first of all , the presence of appropriate coulomb interactions renders the fermionic description untractable .",
    "fortunately , however , we can use bosonization to perform our computations .",
    "this , as is well - known , allows one to treat interactions nonperturbatively . in the bulk",
    ", correlators are rather easily computed .",
    "remember , however , that we are here dealing with two - boundary problems .",
    "this involves treating luttinger liquids and carbon nanotubes in a finite size at finite temperatures , for which we present a computation of all multipoint correlation functions around simple fixed points represented by tractable boundary conditions .",
    "the scaling of the correlators then depends on whether the operators sit away from or near to the boundaries : the scaling near the boundaries differs from that in the bulk , and depends on the specifics of the boundary conditions that are in use .",
    "we venture to treat this problem in all generality at the level of bosonization . for our specific problems",
    ", we set up the perturbative formalism , and present computations for physical transport quantities like the josephson current in different situations , as well as discussions about the pairing order parameter profile .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we treat the noninteracting problem in fermionic language , and compute finite - temperature transport properties using canonical mode expansion methods . in section 3 , we consider the interacting case .",
    "we consider separately the cases of boundary - coupled luttinger liquids , and nanotubes . for each of these",
    ", we discuss separately the cases of normal and andreev boundary conditions , representing `` bad '' and `` good '' coupling to the superconductors ( again , in the sense described above in terms of normal versus andreev reflection amplitudes ; the microscopics of this is a rather tricky experimental issue ) .",
    "the physical results are listed in this part of the paper , and summarized in the conclusion .",
    "important formulas for the bosonization , including computations of correlators at finite temperature in a finite - size geometry are collected in appendix a. in appendix b , we provide some definitions of ( multivariable ) @xmath0-functions appearing in our formulas for the correlation functions .",
    "appendix c is devoted to some notes on the real - time , finite - temperature perturbative formalism we used .",
    "in this section , we concentrate on the case where interactions are absent in the bulk of the system .",
    "the main advantage of this is that the calculation of thermodynamic quantities and of correlators can be performed exactly using relatively straightforward methods .",
    "we choose to always work in a real - time formalism , even in the presence of finite temperatures .",
    "this allows an immediate adaptation of our framework to time - dependent perturbations ( although we do not consider them here , they are in principle easy to address using our formulas , bearing the notes in appendix c in mind ) .",
    "moreover , the definitions and results obtained in this section , in particular the treatment of boundary phenomena , will prove to be a good starting point for other problems later on , when we will consider other physical cases with interactions in the bulk .",
    "our intention is to provide a flexible framework for building theories of _",
    "e.g. _ transport through one - dimensional channels , in many different types of setups .",
    "recent advances in experimental realizations of nanostructures provide good motivation for such types of theories .",
    "our starting point is a theory for @xmath1 decoupled spinful channels of fermions living within a one - dimensional channel of finite size , @xmath2 $ ] , which we often call the fundamental domain .",
    "the spin-@xmath3 fermi fields are labeled by channel @xmath4 and spin indices , @xmath5 .",
    "the canonical equal - time anticommutation relations for the fermions are ( for @xmath60,r[$ ] ) @xmath7 in order to write proper mode expansions for our fermions , we have to be careful with what happens in the presence of the two boundaries . the crucial thing to preserve",
    "is the independence of @xmath5 at both boundaries : we do not want to identify fields at @xmath8 and fields at @xmath9 , as one would normally do using a finite - size setup on a ring .",
    "we here have to start by unfolding the fields , and then requiring some form of periodicity .",
    "the way we do this is by extending the definitions of the fields to the whole real axis by reflecting the original field at both ends of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ by taking @xmath10 this immediately shows that the proper periodicity of the fields is @xmath11 , and not @xmath12 as we would have obtained in a closed ring of circumference @xmath12 .",
    "each channel has a value of the fermi wavevector @xmath13 and fermi velocity @xmath14 which we take as external parameters .",
    "this gives us the flexibility for example to treat the cases where the different channels are put at different external voltages @xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "the relationship between the external voltage @xmath15 applied to channel @xmath16 and the fermi parameters is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fermi wavevector at half - filling . this step in",
    "not crucial at this stage , as most of our formulas will comprise boundary backscattering potentials representing the voltages of leads , so we can simply keep the voltages explicitly instead of reabsorbing them . for transport , only voltage differences matter .",
    "the fermi fields are then linearized as usual in terms of chiral left- and right - movers as @xmath19 with canonical equal - time anticommutation relations @xmath20 and a similar equation for the right movers ( the left and right fields anticommute in the fundamental domain ; note the factor of a half , which is usual for chiral fields @xcite ) . in terms of left- and right - movers , the extensions ( [ extensions ] ) imply the analytical continuations of chiral fields @xmath21 which represent a full mapping between the left- and right - movers in the theory ( that is , we can use one or the other , as long as we choose the right periodicity for getting the proper mode expansions ) .",
    "the appropriate periodicity of the fields then becomes @xmath22 the above formulas in turn imply what we term the normal boundary conditions at the left and right ends of the system , representing the fact that excitations hitting the boundary are simply normal - reflected back into the bulk of the system : @xmath23 the important point to realize is that these boundary conditions represent a link between the fields of the theory : using them , all the fields of the theory can be described either by left- and right - movers in the fundamental domain , or using only e.g. left - movers , defined over an interval twice as big as the fundamental domain .",
    "this set of boundary conditions is used throughout ( half ) of the paper , and represents a basis from which bosonization can be done exactly .",
    "they should be kept closely in mind by the reader .",
    "the action describing the left- and right - movers with normal boundary conditions is composed of a noninteracting bulk part and a specific boundary part which is chosen such as to canonically impose the normal boundary conditions ( [ normalbcs ] ) : @xmath24 the noninteracting bulk action is most conveniently written in terms of a symmetric form of chiral left- and right - movers : @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the boundary action imposing normal boundary conditions is @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{fermionicnormalbcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this theory is very simple : its partition function and correlators are straightforward to obtain , even at finite temperature .",
    "one can easily verify that the equations of motion at the boundaries coincide with the boundary conditions ( [ normalbcs ] ) .",
    "what really interests us , however , is to couple the system to external leads .",
    "one of the most interesting configurations that we can consider is the one where the system is in a josephson junction geometry , whereby the left and right ends are in contact with two superconductors having different order parameters . on general grounds",
    ", one then expects currents to flow through the system even in the absence of voltage bias , part of the phenomena called the josephson effects @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider coupling our system to two external superconductors with bulk gaps well above the excitation energies existing within the conducting channel .",
    "in particular , this means that quasiparticle penetration within the superconductors from the channel are basically non - existent , and that the excitations are either normal- or andreev - reflected immediately back into the channel by the contacts with the superconductors .",
    "an effective theory is therefore obtained by integrating out the superconductors themselves @xcite , leaving behind effective boundary actions taking the form of bcs - like couplings at the ends of the system .",
    "therefore , we perturb the free action by the additional boundary actions @xmath27 , \\nonumber \\\\   s^{(bdry)}_{r } = - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt \\sum_{i , j = 1}^n \\left [ \\delta^{ij}_r   \\psi_{\\uparrow}^{i \\dagger } ( r ) \\psi_{\\downarrow}^{j \\dagger } ( r ) + \\delta^{ij * } _ r \\psi_{\\downarrow}^j ( r ) \\psi_{\\uparrow}^i ( r ) + v^{ij}_r \\sum_{\\sigma } \\psi_{\\sigma}^{i \\dagger } ( r ) \\psi_{\\sigma}^j ( r ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the boundary bcs couplings @xmath28 are effective couplings coming from the integrating out procedure detailed above ( we refer the reader to the discussion in paper @xcite , where this is presented in all necessary details ) .",
    "it is very important not to confuse them with the bulk couplings of the original superconductors : the boundary pairings contain information about the quality of the contact , the density of states of the superconductor at the junction , etc .",
    "we take them as external parameters .",
    "their phase , however , can be reasonably supposed to be that of the original superconductors at low energies .",
    "the one advantage of this form of the boundary perturbation is that it preserves the bilinear form of the action as far as the fermions are concerned .",
    "the theory can therefore again be solved exactly .",

    "we leave these for now , and turn instead to the effects of interactions in the bulk .",
    "in this section , we study two general classes of interacting one - dimensional systems at finite size , coupled to the boundary conditions that simulate the superconducting leads to which the real system is coupled .",
    "we consider first the case of a multichannel luttinger liquid in which the different channels only interact through the boundaries .",
    "then we study the case of a carbon nanotube which can be modelled as a two channel luttinger liquid with a particular choice of interchannel coupling . in both cases , we consider as the starting point the system coupled to either normal or andreev boundary conditions , and introduce more general boundary conditions perturbatively .",
    "these lead to different types of behaviour , which we detail by presenting computations of the josephson current ( either perturbatively or exactly depending on the situation ) , and of the superconducting order parameter profile in the bulk of the system induced by the presence of the superconducting leads ( the `` proximity effect '' ) .      it has long been appreciated theoretically that the interacting luttinger liquid provides a one - dimensional metallic counterpart to the higher - dimensional fermi - liquid state . however , there are no fermionic quasi - particles in a luttinger liquid and the elementary excitations are rather bosonic collective charge and spin fluctuations dispersing with different velocities .",
    "one needs to take interactions into account right from the beginning by using the bosonization technique .",
    "the power of this technique resides in the fact that it allows to express an interacting fermionic hamiltonian in terms of a noninteracting bosonic one .",

    "we wish here to discuss some details of the derivation of the matsubara formalism from first principles , and show that in our geometry of interest , i.e. a one - dimensional finite - size system , there are subtleties one has to bear in mind .",

    ", we obtain after changing integration variables and using the periodicity of @xmath313 @xmath324 f(t_1 + t ) h_1 ( t_1 ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can then combine the two integrals into one closed contour ( using @xmath325 by construction ) and a leftover matsubara piece : @xmath326 let us suppose that we are in an infinite ( and therefore aperiodic ) system . if we choose to turn on our interaction @xmath312 at a very remote point in the past as compared to any object we want to calculate ( say @xmath327 ) , then @xmath313 will have poles only extremely far away , and the first correction will yield expectation values with extremely large time difference , which one can safely take to vanish .",
    "moreover , near @xmath327 , we suppose that @xmath313 has reached its asymptotic behaviour @xmath328 .",
