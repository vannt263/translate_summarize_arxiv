    "the early experiments of ferromagnetic materials @xcite show that the resistivity increases with the increase of the number of the domain walls .",
    "this result seems to admit of no doubt because the conduction electrons are scattered by the domain walls @xcite .",
    "an opposite result , however , was reported recently , i.e. , the existence of a _ negative _ domain wall contribution to the resistivity was proposed from experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies . in particular , tatara and",
    "fukuyama @xcite stated that the existence of impurities plays an important roll for the negative domain wall contribution .",
    "we should note that some other recent studies @xcite show that a domain wall contribution to resistivity is _",
    "positive_. as a starting point , it is necessary to study the problem of the scattering of conduction electrons by a single domain wall .",
    "this problem was considered in the early works @xcite by cabrera and falicov .",
    "but they treated the spins of the domain wall classically .    in this paper , we study the scattering of an electron by a _",
    "quantum _ domain wall which is realized as a ground state of the quantum heisenberg - ising model ( xxz model ) with certain boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the spin of the conduction electron interacts with the spins of the xxz model by the hund coupling .",
    "our main results are the following two : ( i ) we analytically obtain the exact effective schrdinger equation for the conduction electron .",
    "more precisely the spin of the conduction electron feels the effective magnetic field of @xmath1 , and the amplitude of the spin flip is proportional to @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the one - dimensional coordinate perpendicular to the domain wall centered at @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the width of the domain wall .",
    "our effective schrdinger equation coincides with a conventional phenomenological schrdinger equation by cabrera and falicov @xcite . from this equation",
    ", one can immediately notice that the domain wall never transmits an electron with low energy without a spin flip of the electron .",
    "( ii ) by solving the effective schrdinger equation numerically , we have calculated the transmission coefficient which is a function of the hund coupling and of the width of the domain wall .",
    "( the width is determined by the anisotropic exchange of the xxz model . )",
    "it turns out that the transmission coefficient is vanishing in the low energy limit for the electron . as an example of a real system ,",
    "consider a quantum wire with a single domain and with low density impurities .",
    "then the transmission coefficient we obatined leads to the conductance by relying on the landauer formula .",
    "unfortunately it is not so easy to realize this situation in an experiment .    throughout the present paper ,",
    "we assume that the systems we consider are spatially homogeneous except for the @xmath3 direction perpendicular to domain walls . having this assumption in mind",
    ", we treat the systems in any dimension as a one - dimensional one in this paper .",
    "before discussing a quantum domain wall , we briefly review a classical treatment of a domain wall .",
    "the spin configuration of a classical domain wall ( bloch wall ) is represented by a vector - valued function @xmath6 of the position @xmath3 . in @xcite , the authors assumed @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is the width of the domain wall , and @xmath8 is a real constant .",
    "the interaction between @xmath6 and the spin @xmath9 of a conduction electron is given by the hund coupling @xmath10 with the anisotropy @xmath11 .",
    "then the schrdinger equation for the conduction electron is given by @xmath12 \\psi_{\\uparrow } = \\frac{b}{2}{\\rm sech}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\psi_{\\downarrow } } , \\nonumber\\\\ \\quad \\nonumber\\\\ \\displaystyle{\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\frac{d^2}{d x^2 } + \\frac{b\\delta}{2}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)-e\\right ] \\psi_{\\downarrow } = \\frac{b}{2}{\\rm sech}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\psi_{\\uparrow } , } \\end{array } \\right .",

    "far right from the domain wall ( @xmath18 ) , a up - spin electron has lower energy of the hund coupling than an down - spin electron . in the opposite region ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "up and down spins interchange their situation .",
    "if an electron goes thorough the domain wall without a spin flip of the electron , then the electron feels the potential barrier .",
    "a spin flip of the electron occurs only near the domain wall .    in this treatment , the effective magnetic potential for the conduction electrons",
    "is assumed to be identical to the profile of the domain wall .",
    "clearly the potential should be derived from a microscopic hamiltonian because the spins of the conduction electrons interact with _",
    "quantum spins _ of a domain wall .",
    "the domain wall also should be realized in the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "thus the phenomenological schrdinger equation by cabrera and falicov needs to be justified from a microscopic level .",
    "in order to introduce a quantum domain wall , we consider the spin-1/2 heisenberg - ising model ( xxz model ) on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "we apply the boundary fields to make a single domain wall as a ground state .",
    "the sector of the ground states @xcite of @xmath27 for a finite size @xmath28 is spanned by the set of the product states @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a complex number , and @xmath31 here @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the spin up and down states , respectively .",
    "write @xmath37 with real numbers @xmath38",
    ". then @xmath39 specifies the position of the domain wall and the angle @xmath40 is a quantum mechanical phase corresponding to the degrees of freedom of the rotation about the third axis of the spin .",
