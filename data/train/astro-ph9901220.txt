    "inflationary theory has had a large impact on cosmology . on the one hand",
    ", it resolves some difficulties of the standard big - bang model . on the other",
    ", it provides a way of producing those density fluctuations that in the gravitational instability scenario are the seed of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "in fact , one of the most reliable predictions of the inflationary paradigm is the parallel production of scalar and tensor perturbations from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of tensor fluctuations determines the value of the inflationary potential and , together with other inflationary parameters , its first two derivatives ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a detection of a nearly scale - invariant stochastic gravitational wave ( gw ) background ( tensor modes ) is crucial in order to confirm any inflationary model and constrain the physics occurring near the planck scale , at @xmath3 .",
    "observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy promise to be unique in this respect ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that inflationary parameters will be measured with an accuracy of few percent by the map ( @xcite ) and planck ( @xcite ) space missions , which will image the cmb anisotropy pattern with high sensitivity and at high angular resolution .",
    "meanwhile , the number of experiments reporting detections of anisotropy has increased to a couple of ten ( see table 1 , below ) . at the moment ,",
    "the detections available seem compatible with the predictions of inflationary models , like cold dark matter ( cdm ) , with `` blue '' power spectra , i.e. @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as noticed by many authors , there is a substantial rise in the anisotropy angular power spectrum at @xmath6 , which appears to be consistent with the expected location of the first doppler peak in flat models .",
    "this small scale behaviour seems to disfavor a gw contribution .",
    "in fact , as is well known , tensor fluctuations induce anisotropy only on large angular scales ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if there is a sizable contribution from gw in large scale detected anisotropies , this would lower the predicted value of @xmath8 on smaller scales .",
    "moreover , inflationary models that predict @xmath5 generally predict vanishingly small tensor fluctuations ( @xcite ) .    based on these arguments , a lot of recent cmb data analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) has not taken into account the possible presence of a gw background , assuming its contribution to be negligible .    in our opinion , there are two points that can alter these conclusions :    - tensor modes are compatible with the theory of linear adiabatic perturbations of a homogeneous and isotropic universe . like scalar perturbations and in contrast with vector perturbations , they can arise from small deviations from the isotropic friedmann universe near the initial singularity .",
    "so , cmb data should be analyzed without any _ a priori _ assumptions : the presence or absence of a tensor component in models with @xmath9 can be only tested by observation .",
    "- few variations in the still undetermined cosmological parameters ( like the baryonic abundance or the hubble constant ) and inflationary parameters ( like the spectral index @xmath10 ) can counterbalance the effect of tensor modes , increasing the predicted value of @xmath8 on small scales .",
    "thus , in this _ paper _ , we will discuss what kind of constraint present cmb anisotropy data provide on the tensor contribution allowing all the remaining parameters to vary freely in their acceptable ranges .",
    "we will extend our previous cmb data analysis ( @xcite ) , by including new cmb detections , and by analyzing a larger set of models .",
    "we restrict ourselves to critical universes ( @xmath11 ) , as a recent analysis of cmb anisotropies and galaxy surveys ( @xcite ) has shown that pure scalar mixed dark matter ( mdm ) models are in good agreement with the data set .",
    "we will address the importance of a cosmological constant , reported by @xcite and @xcite , in a forthcoming paper .    since we treat the gw contribution as a free parameter , we will not test any specific inflationary model .",
    "so , our approach will be mainly phenomenological : we assume that gw are created in the early universe by some process during or immediately after inflation , which we do not want to specify any further here .",
    "nonetheless , as the amplitude of the gw spectrum provides a test for inflation ( see next section ) , in our conclusions we will discuss if results are compatible with this paradigm .",
    "since any possible gw signal will affect the matter power spectrum normalization inferred from cobe , we will test the models that best fit the cmb data with the normalization @xmath12 of the matter fluctuation in @xmath13 spheres and with the shape of the spectrum from the @xcite analysis .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we write the set of equations necessary to describe the inflationary process in the slow roll approximation . in sect.3",
    "we briefly discuss the analysis of the current degree - scale cmb experiments .",
    "in sect.4 we test the best fit models with the large - scale structure ( lss ) data . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present and discuss our conclusions .",
    "inflation in the early universe is determined by the potential @xmath14 , where @xmath15 can be a multiplet of scalar fields . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a single , minimally coupled scalar field @xmath16 with potential @xmath17 and equation of motion    @xmath18    ( as usual , the dot and prime indicate derivatives with respect to physical time @xmath19 and to the scalar field @xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "the expansion rate in the early universe can be written as : @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the planck mass ( we use natural units , i.e. @xmath22 ) .",
    "the slow - roll approximation holds in most of the inflationary models .",
    "this condition is valid if ( @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath23 = \\eta ( \\phi ) < < 1\\ ] ] and @xmath24    the second condition , since @xmath25 is a direct measure of the equation of state of the scalar field matter , also implies the period of accelerated expansion ( @xcite ) .    in the slow roll approximation the amplitude of scalar and tensor perturbations",
    "are related to the inflationary potential as follows ( @xcite ) : @xmath26 and @xmath27    we can relate the wavelength , @xmath28 , and the hubble parameter during inflation , @xmath29 , with the scalar field by writing :    @xmath30    and    @xmath31    respectively .",
    "let us define the spectral equations for scalar and tensor components as follows :    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the wavenumber of a fluctuation which re - enters the horizon at the present time , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath37 if @xmath38 , and @xmath39 if @xmath40 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we define the ratio of amplitudes of the scalar and tensor modes by :    @xmath41    by solving eq.(7 ) and assuming @xmath42 , the scalar field can be written as a function of the wavelength :    @xmath43\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is a constant , to be found from boundary conditions , and @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , eq.s ( 12 ) and ( 8) allow us to find the hubble parameter @xmath29 during inflation :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "the potential can be written in terms of the hubble parameter :    @xmath49    at this point , we can define the relation between the quadrupole multipoles of the cmb anisotropy generated by scalar and tensor perturbations : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . to do this",
    "we will follow the calculations done by ( @xcite ) in which both @xmath50 and @xmath51 were found as a function of @xmath29 at @xmath52 .",
    "so we have :    @xmath53    and    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    using eq.(13 ) we can write :    @xmath56    therefore , at @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , we have :    @xmath59    as we can see from the equation above , the tensor to scalar quadrupole ratio @xmath60 is related to the slow - roll parameter @xmath25 .",
    "( 20 ) identifies a region in the ( @xmath10,@xmath60 ) space of values where the slow - roll condition is satisfied .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath61 only if the universe has undergone a period of accelerated expansion , one can use this equation to test the inflationary scenario .    in the same way , we can use eq.(19 ) in eq.(3 ) in order to find :    @xmath62    so the slow roll condition ( 4 ) implies eq .",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath63 .    using eq.(14 ) , we can now write the potential as    @xmath64    therefore , the measurement of the contribution to the quadrupole anisotropy of tensor fluctuation , @xmath51 , allows us to estimate the size of the potential responsible for inflation .",
    "we use a set of the most recent cmb anisotropy detections , both on large and degree angular scales , in order to estimate the amplitude of tensor fluctuations .",
    "the likelihood of the assumed independent cmb anisotropy data is ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath65)^{1/2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & exp ( - \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\frac{[{\\delta_j}^{(exp ) } - \\delta_j^{(the)}]^2}{(\\sigma_j^ { ( the ) } ) ^2 + ( { \\sigma_j^{(exp)}})^2 } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the experimentally detected and theoretically expected mean square anisotropy , respectively .",
    "the @xmath68 and @xmath68 are the respective cosmic and experimental variances .",
    "obviously , the likelihood depends on the parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "although a complete analysis should cover all the parameter space , here we restrict ourselves to flat models ( @xmath69 ) composed of baryons ( @xmath70 ) , cold dark matter ( @xmath71 ) , hot dark matter ( @xmath72 ) , photons and massless neutrinos . as shown in ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) the angular power spectrum of mdm models differs from pure cdm by less than @xmath73 in the angular scales of interest . given the poor sensitivity of the available cmb anisotropy detections at degree angular scales , we restrict ourselves to pure cdm models , keeping in mind that basically the same power spectrum is also expected for mdm models . the predictions of cdm and mdm models for the matter power spectrum obviously differ , and in a substantial way : we will discuss this point in more detail below .    here",
    "we keep as free parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "both parameters affect the positions and amplitudes of the so - called doppler peaks of the angular power spectrum .",
    "in fact , changing @xmath74 at fixed @xmath75 changes the pressure of the baryon - photon fluid before recombination , increasing its oscillations below its jeans length . a larger baryon to photon",
    "ratio will increase the compressions ( which produce the even peaks in @xmath76 for inflationary models ) and decrease the rarefaction ( odd peaks for inflationary models ) .",
    "lowering @xmath75 at fixed @xmath74 changes the epoch of matter - radiation equality : potentials inside the horizon decay in a radiation dominated era but not in a fully matter dominated one .",
    "the combination @xmath77 , which actually appears in the calculations , is also constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis arguments ( @xcite ) : @xmath78 . moreover , from globular cluster ages , @xmath79 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will also explore variations in the spectral index of the ( scalar ) primordial power spectrum @xmath10 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to values of @xmath80 , to be consistent with the absence of spectral distortions in the cobe / firas data ( @xcite ) .",
    "a parameter independent normalization for the power spectrum can be expressed in terms of the amplitude of the multipole @xmath81 .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath82 as the amplitude @xmath83 of the power spectrum ( considered as a free parameter ) in units of @xmath84 , the amplitude needed to reproduce @xmath85 , as observed on the cobe - dmr four - year maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , for tensor fluctuations , we will assume @xmath86 .",
    "in fact , variations in the tensor spectral index in the range @xmath87 do not give appreciable changes in the structure of the @xmath76 s , given the cosmic variance and the current experimental sensitivity .",
    "we parameterize the amplitude of these tensor fluctuations with @xmath60 , defined in eq .",
    "so , in the end , we will consider only five quantities as free parameters : @xmath83 , @xmath10 , @xmath60 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we have computed the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy by solving the boltzmann equation for fluctuations in cmb brightness ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our code is described in ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and allows the study of cmb anisotropy both in cold ( cdm ) and mixed ( mdm ) dark matter models .",
    "our @xmath76 s match to better than @xmath88 for @xmath89 compared with those of other codes ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show the @xmath76 s for different parameter choices .",
    "the data we consider are listed in table 1 and shown in fig .",
    "1 . we have updated the data presented in our previous paper ( @xcite ) to include the new results from the tenerife , msam and cat experiments . for the cobe data , we use the @xmath90 data points from @xcite , that have the advantage of uncorrelated error bars .",
    "the best fit parameters ( i.e. those which maximize the likelihood ) are ( with @xmath91 confidence ) : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we can only put the following upper limits ( at @xmath97 ) on these last two best fit values : @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "a probability confidence level contour in the five dimension volume of parameters is obtained by cutting the @xmath100 distribution with the isosurface @xmath101 , and by requiring that the volume inside @xmath101 is a a fraction @xmath102 of the total volume .",
    "the projections of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 surfaces on the @xmath105 plane are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    as we can see from fig .",
    "2 , the likelihood contours are very broad and models with spectral index @xmath106 and @xmath107 are statistically indistinguishable from models with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the quite large values of @xmath60 for @xmath110 are due to a parameter degeneracy problem that present cmb anisotropy detections are not able to solve ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in fact",
    ", increasing the contribution of tensor modes boosts the anisotropy on large scales ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "as the theoretical predictions are normalized to cobe / dmr , adding tensor fluctuations while keeping all the other parameters fixed , actually suppresses the level of degree scale anisotropy . to counterbalance this effect",
    ", it is necessary to postulate `` blue '' primordial spectra , @xmath112 .",
    "the shape of the confidence level region in the @xmath113 plane reflects this correlation .",
    "this degeneracy in the model prediction is actually broken at a higher angular resolution , @xmath114 say , where present experiments are particularly affected by cosmic variance , due to the very small region of the sky sampled ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we have the following @xmath115 c.l .",
    "upper limits on @xmath60 : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath117 , respectively . at @xmath127 and @xmath128",
    "we can put @xmath115 c.l .",
    "lower limits of @xmath124 and @xmath129 on @xmath60 . a quadratic fit to the maxima distribution",
    "gives :    @xmath130    for @xmath131 . with the above equation , we find that the tensor component can have an rms amplitude value of @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath135 , while the scalar component remains at @xmath136 .",
    "it is interesting to see ( fig.1 ) that models with @xmath108 and @xmath137 , which are well compatible with our analysis , seem to prefer a greater hubble constant , @xmath138 .",
    "so , the gravitational wave contribution also seem to moderate the discrepancy between the value @xmath139 ( @xcite ) , inferred by several different methods , and the value @xmath140 ( @xcite ) inferred by scalar - only cmb analysis .",
    "we found that inside the @xmath115 contour , the overall normalization amplitude , in units of @xmath84 is @xmath141 , _",
    "i.e. _ all the models considered therein correspond well with cobe / dmr normalization .",
    "the simple analysis carried out here does not take into account the correlation due to overlapping sky coverage ( e.g. , tenerife and cobe , and/or msam and saskatoon ) .",
    "we check the stability of our analysis with a jacknife test , i.e. removing one set of experimental data each time .",
    "we have a maximum variation of @xmath142 in our limits in the @xmath105 plane , except with the removal of cobe data that modifies our results by @xmath143 .",
    "so , neglecting this correlation does not significantly change the results of our analysis .",
    "we also repeated the analysis including the possible @xmath144 calibration error to the five saskatoon points ( @xcite ) , and we did not find significant variations . in the limited cases where comparison is possible , our analysis produced results similar to those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , blue models with a substantial tensor component agree well with cmb data .",
    "tensor modes have dramatic effects on the matter power spectrum , reducing its normalization by a factor of @xmath145 . using the above fit formula",
    ", the tensor contribution to the cmb correlation function on the cobe / dmr scales can be between @xmath146 for @xmath133 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 . in this section",
    "we want to test these models with large scale matter distribution .",
    "as is well known , cdm blue models predict a universe that is too inhomogeneous on scales @xmath149 .",
    "nonetheless , the excess power on these scales can be reduced by considering a mixture of cold and hot dark matter , i.e. mixed dark matter ( mdm ) models .",
    "the difference in the @xmath150 behaviour between a pure cdm and an mdm ( @xmath151 ) model is very tiny , @xmath152 up to @xmath153 and @xmath154 up to @xmath155 ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the results of our cmb analysis are the same in this kind of model . in figure 3 ,",
    "mdm matter power spectra from models that agree with cmb data are shown .",
    "the data points are an estimate of the linear power spectrum from @xcite , assuming a cdm flat universe and bias values between abell , radio , optical , and iras catalogs @xmath156 with @xmath157 .",
    "as shown in ( @xcite ) recovered linear power spectra of cdm and mdm models are nearly the same in the region @xmath158 but diverge from this spectrum at higher @xmath159 , so we restrict ourselves to this range . the @xmath160 ( with @xmath161 degrees of freedom )",
    "are @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 for models in figure 3 with @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171,@xmath172 and @xmath173 in the @xmath174 space .",
    "so , models with a large tensor contribution on cobe scales and blue spectral index seem to agree well also with the shape of matter distribution on large scale . the values for the @xmath175 , computed with cmbfast ( @xcite ) , are @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , in very reasonable agreement with the value of @xmath181 ( @xcite ) derived from the iras catalog .",
    "whether iras galaxies are biased is still under debate .",
    "analysis from cluster data ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , shows a preferred value of @xmath182 with few percent error bars . analysis from peculiar velocities ( @xcite ) results in a larger value @xmath183 , which seems to be in severe conflict with the cluster data .",
    "thus , the theoretical values of @xmath12 for blue mdm models with a relic gravitational wave background are between the @xmath12 values derived from cluster abundance and peculiar velocities . in any case , the likelihood of the cmb data is quite flat around its maximum .",
    "so , it is easy to find models , statistically indistinguishable from the best fit models , with @xmath12 nearer either to @xmath184 or to @xmath185 .    because of statistical and/or systematic uncertainties we do not consider it appropriate to put more than qualitative conclusions on these results , but still one can say that the lower matter normalization due to the tensor component helps the blue mdm models to match the lss data",
    "our main conclusions , are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the conditional likelihood shows a maximum at @xmath92 , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , there is some evidence that a tensor component can be present , and in a substantial way , in models with @xmath186 greater than one .",
    "inflationary models of this type have been investigated by @xcite and by @xcite and thus belong to the class of hybrid inflationary models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the general form of the potential can be written as @xmath187 at the end of inflation , the inflationary potential @xmath188 is not equal to zero , being @xmath189 of the order of @xmath190 . in order to be consistent with the present vacuum energy @xmath191 ,",
    "one additional field is necessary to finish inflation .",
    "the inclusion of this field does not change the conclusion of our analysis , since it affects only the high frequency region of the gw spectrum ( @xmath192 ) . for models on the best fit curve ( eq.24 )",
    ", @xmath193 belongs to the interval @xmath194 . in fig.2",
    "we plot eq.(24 ) with the condition @xmath195 .",
    "the region below this curve in the @xmath196 plane is where the slow roll approximation is valid .",
    "as we can see , models on our best fit curve satisfy this condition , even if models with @xmath197 are compatible with observations .      \\2 .",
    "the @xmath115 region on the @xmath105 plane includes a wide range of parameters .",
    "this means that the presently available data set is not sensitive enough to produce precise determinations for @xmath10 and @xmath60 .",
    "systematic and statistical errors in the different experiments are still significant , but , as we have shown , the difficulties involved in such determinations are mainly due to a degeneracy in these parameters .",
    "so , the @xmath200 degeneracy has important consequences for tests of the inflationary theory : increasing the scalar spectral index and the tensor component lead to a break in the slow roll approximation , but it also produces cmb power spectra near to the scale invariant one . therefore it is difficult from the present cmb data to see if the slow roll condition is correct .",
    "furthermore , current cmb results on the normalization of the matter power spectrum and/or its spectral index can be biassed and/or anti - biassed by a huge tensor contribution .",
    "as we can see from fig.1 , this degeneration also has effects on the constraints of the remaining cosmological parameters , being a model with @xmath138 statistically indistinguishable from a model with @xmath140 .",
    "the inflationary background of primordial gravitational waves is assumed detectable mainly through cmb experiments .",
    "the local energy density of this background is , in the most optimistic situation , extremely low , with @xmath201 at frequencies @xmath202 .",
    "the tenuity of this signal makes the degeneracy in the @xmath10 and @xmath60 parameters much more worrying than similar degeneracy in other parameters ( e.g. @xmath75 and @xmath74 ) that could be constrained through other measurements .",
    "`` blue '' mdm models with a tensor contribution , are in reasonable agreement with the present values of @xmath12 , and with the shape of the matter power spectrum inferred by the @xcite analysis .",
    "a tensor contribution could also be a viable mechanism in order to reconcile these models with a low value for the @xmath12 around @xmath203 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this being the situation , a measure of the structure of the secondary peaks becomes a crucial test for the presence of tensor perturbations . using the above best fit equation , we can make some predictions regarding future detections .",
    "we found that an experiment with a window function probing the multipoles @xmath204 , will measure a total rms anisotropy of @xmath205 for @xmath133 , and @xmath206 , with @xmath207 .",
    "an @xmath208 difference that could be proven , when the sensitivity of these experiments is within a few @xmath209 , with an improved sky coverage .",
    "polarization measurements at intermediate angular scales can also be helpful ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of a direct separation of scalar perturbations from tensor perturbations by the method of decomposition of stocks parameters in sets of spin @xmath210 spherical harmonics seems extremely promising ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we study the possible contribution of a stochastic gravitational wave background to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in cold and mixed dark matter ( cdm and mdm ) models . </S>",
    "<S> we test this contribution against recent detections of cmb anisotropy at large and intermediate angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> our likelihood analysis indicates that models with blue power spectra ( @xmath0 ) and a tensor to the scalar quadrupole ratio of @xmath1 are most consistent with the anisotropy data considered here . </S>",
    "<S> we find that by including the possibility of such background in cmb data analysis it can drastically alter the conclusion on the remaining cosmological parameters .    </S>",
