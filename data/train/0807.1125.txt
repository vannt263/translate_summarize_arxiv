    "the beam had a contamination of positrons , at the same momentum , with a typical rate of 22  khz , as well as a small fraction of pions .",
    "the muon beam was characterized and tuned using a low pressure ( 8  kpa dimethylether ( dme ) gas ) removable beam monitoring chamber located upstream of the twist spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the beam monitor was inserted for measurement of the beam properties , and removed during data - taking .",
    "the twist spectrometer  @xcite was designed to measure a broad range of the muon decay spectrum , allowing the simultaneous determination of the decay parameters .",
    "the detector consisted of 44 drift chambers ( dcs ) and 12 multiwire proportional chambers ( pcs ) in a planar geometry , symmetric about a muon stopping target foil at the centre .",

    "the muon stopping target was a @xmath60  foil of 99.999% pure aluminum , which also served as a cathode foil for the adjacent two pcs ( see below ) .",
    "the muon stopping distribution , as determined from the last dc or pc plane in which the muon left a signal , was used in a feedback loop to control the fractions of he and co@xmath61 in a gas degrader at the end of the beamline , in order to maintain the average stopping position of the selected muons at the centre of the target .",
    "muons were required to be recorded by the pc immediately before the stopping target ( pc  6 ) and not by the pc immediately after the target ( pc  7 ) ; simulations showed that @xmath62% of selected muons stopped in the target , with the rest stopping in the cf@xmath63/isobutane , the cathode foils , or the wires in the vicinity of the target .",
    "the experiment watched for muons decaying at rest into positrons ; decays of muons in flight were identified and discarded .",
    "each pc and dc consisted of a wire plane and two cathode foil planes , all oriented perpendicular to the detector axis .",
    "chambers were grouped together in modules as described below , and the cathode foils interior to each module were shared between adjacent chambers .",

    "was used in these chambers .",
    "the pcs mainly provided particle timing information ; in addition the widths of the timing signals from the pcs were used to discriminate muons from positrons .",
    "each half of the detector included 22 dcs , with a slow drift gas ( dme ) , which had a small lorentz angle ; these provided precise measurements of the @xmath67 position as it crossed the chamber .",
    "each dc plane  @xcite included 80 sense wires at 4  mm pitch .",
    "the dc planes were very slightly asymmetric in the direction along the detector axis , in that the wires were located 150  off of the centre of the cell .",
    "28 of the dcs were paired together in 14 modules , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 wire planes in each pair .",
    "additional `` dense '' stacks of eight planes each were located near either end of the detector .",

    "the chamber gas and the helium mixture were maintained at atmospheric pressure .",
    "the differential pressure between the chambers and the surrounding volumes was controlled to stabilize the positions of the chamber foils .",

    "the alignment of the chambers to the magnetic field was measured using positron tracks in the 2  t field , and had an uncertainty of 0.03  mrad .",
    "the chambers were positioned within the 1  m bore of a liquid - helium - cooled superconducting solenoid .",
    "the magnet was placed inside a cube - shaped steel yoke , approximately 3  m per side , designed to increase the uniformity of the field within the detector region .",
    "the shape of the @xmath58 component of the magnetic field was mapped using an array of hall probes mounted on a radial arm , aligned along the solenoid axis and calibrated using an nmr probe .",
    "the probes positions at each field sample were known to @xmath68  mm , and the field was mapped to a precision of @xmath69  t. the standard operating setting for twist is 2  t at the centre of the solenoid ; at this setting the field is uniform to within 8@xmath70  t within the tracking region .",
    "a finite - element simulation of the magnetic field was performed using opera3d  @xcite , providing the full three - dimensional magnetic field throughout the detector volume and well outside the measured region . within the tracking region",
    "the simulated field map agreed with the measurements to within @xmath71  t.    event acquisition was triggered by a thin scintillator upstream of the spectrometer .",
    "only 1.8% of events were triggered by a beam positron , in spite of the much higher rate of beam positrons compared to muons ; most beam positrons were discriminated against by the trigger threshold .",
    "remaining beam positrons were identified with high efficiency in the data since they left signals in the full length of the detector .",
    "preamplifier chips were mounted directly on the chambers and drove custom postamplifier and discriminator modules placed 2  m away .",
    "the chamber behavior was exceptionally stable , with less than one high voltage trip per month .",

    "data acquisition from scintillators and tracking chambers  @xcite was performed using lecroy model  1877 tdcs .",
    "the trigger and tdc read - out recorded signals in 0.5  ns time bins from 6  @xmath14s  before to 10  @xmath14s  after a muon passed through the trigger scintillator .",
    "the start and stop of each pulse was recorded so that the pulse width could be determined ; these widths can be related to the amount of energy deposited in the cell . in this configuration",
    "up to eight wire signals could be recorded for each wire in any triggered event .",
    "a fixed blanking time of 80  @xmath14s  was imposed after each accepted trigger , to allow each tdc to finish conversion before the next event was recorded .",
    "the data considered for this analysis were more than 1.5@xmath72 muon decays , taken during 2004 .",
    "the data sets , summarized in table  [ tab : datasets ] , were taken under a variety of conditions ( low polarization from beam steering , rate , muon stopping position , etc . ) . provided the simulation reproduced these conditions correctly",

    "@xmath83 is forbidden , so the general measurement of @xmath0 can be converted into a 90% confidence limit lower bound within lrs models : @xmath84 ( compared with @xmath85 from the @xmath0 measurement previously published by twist ) .",
    "the relation @xmath86 then gives a 90% confidence limit of @xmath87 , a significant improvement over the limit of @xmath88 for the previously published twist value of @xmath0 .",
    "the final phase of twist is in progress .",
    "additional data are in hand , taken in 2006 and 2007 , and new analysis is underway .",
    "further improvements to the simulation and analysis are being implemented , including the use of measured drift time tables and improved track reconstruction algorithms , and the resulting better agreement in the momentum resolution between simulation and data .",
