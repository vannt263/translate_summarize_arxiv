    "<S> the existence of an exotic long - lived negatively charged massive particle , i.e. , @xmath0 , during big bang nucleosynthesis can affect primordial light element abundances . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the final abundance of @xmath1li , mainly originating from the electron capture of @xmath1be , has been suggested to reduce by the @xmath1be destruction via the radiative @xmath0 capture of @xmath1be followed by the radiative proton capture of the bound state of @xmath1be and @xmath0 ( @xmath1be@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a new route of @xmath1be@xmath2 formation , that is the @xmath1be charge exchange at the reaction of  ion and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the formation rate depends on the number fraction of  ion , the charge exchange cross section of and the probability that produced excited states @xmath1be@xmath3 are converted to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate respective quantities affecting the @xmath1be@xmath2 formation rate , and find that this reaction pathway can be more important than ordinary radiative recombination of @xmath1be and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the charge exchange reaction is then shown in a latest nuclear reaction network calculation . </S>",
    "<S> quantum physical model calculations for related reactions are needed to precisely estimate the efficiency of this pathway in future . </S>"
