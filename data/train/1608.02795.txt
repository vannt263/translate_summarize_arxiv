    "most of biological molecules are polymers , and the formation of contacts between monomers which are not close along the chain usually plays an important biological role . for example , in the chromatin fibre the approaching of an enhancer to a promoter located millions of bases away is often necessary to trigger transcription @xcite . in the case of proteins ,",
    "the formation of non  covalent interactions between distant amino acids is , in many cases , among the first steps in the folding process @xcite .",
    "there are several experimental techniques to study , either directly or indirectly , the formation of contacts between pairs of monomers as a function of their distance @xmath0 along the polymeric chain . arguably , when @xmath0 is large enough , the detailed chemistry of the system looses importance and one can highlight its more general physical properties . in the case of chromosome folding , it was found by hi ",

    "the folding rate of proteins , measured by stopped - flow experiments , was shown to correlate with the ( rescaled ) average value of @xmath0 of pairs of amino acids which are in contact in the native state @xcite . in long rna chains",
    "the contact probability displays an exponent @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the simplest theoretical framework to describe the contact formation in a biopolymer at equilibrium as a function of @xmath0 is that of two interacting monomers linked by a homopolymer .",
    "one can employ a two  state description of the system , assuming that the formation of the contact between the two ends does not change the density of the polymer . in this case ,",
    "if @xmath4 is the energy gain of the system upon formation of the contact , the associated probability can be approximated as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density of state of the system displaying the contact with respect of the unbound state .",
    "its shape depends on the properties of the linking homopolymer . if this can be regarded as an ideal chain then @xmath7 , if it is a random coil due to the repulsion between its elements , @xmath8 , while it is constant in a globule @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath0 one",
    "then expects a scaling law of the type @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 , as discussed above .",

    "@xcite lie between those expected for an ideal chain and a random coil . in the case of chromatin ,",
    "the anomalous exponent @xmath13 found in experiments is not compatible with the above model and was explained either with non - equilibrium effects @xcite , with interactions mediated by floating molecules @xcite or by energy  driven mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases , the monomers which build polymers of biological interest are chemically heterogeneous , and the homopolymeric assumption is questionable .",
    "the problem we would like to address in the present work is the role of heterogeneous interactions in determining the scaling properties of the contact probability between monomers .",
    "specifically , we study the looping probability of random heteropolymers @xcite , regarding them as a minimal model for biomolecules .    to investigate this problem , we made use of a simple model , in which the polymer is described as a chain of beads connected by rigid links .",
    "pairs of beads interact through a spherical  well potential with a hard  core of radius @xmath14 , a width @xmath15 and a depth @xmath16 which depends on the specific pair . for sake of generality , we considered the energies @xmath16 as quenched stochastic variables , defined by a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath17 and standard deviation @xmath18 . in this way we are not focusing on a particular kind of biopolymer , but we are looking for the general properties which arise only because of the heterogeneity of the interactions .",
    "operatively , we investigated the equilibrium contact probability of heteropolymeric chains by mean of numerical simulations . in this case , the stochasticity of the interaction energies is modelled generating several realizations of the set of gaussian variables , and for each of them carrying out a conformational sampling .",
    "this approach poses the problem of averaging the results of the samplings over the quenched energies .",
    "the contact probability itself does not result to be a self  averaging quantity , and consequently its average over the realizations of the quenched variables @xmath16 is poorly informative @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sect : selfav ] we discuss under which conditions the average of quantities associated with the contact probability are informative .",
    "another problem one has to face is that the conformational sampling of disordered systems is computationally cumbersome , due to the roughness of the associated energy landscape .",
    "there are several computational techniques based on the multi ",
    "canonical ensemble which , sampling the system simultaneously at different temperatures , facilitate conformational sampling @xcite .",
    "however , they rely on the choice of a set of temperatures optimized to enhance diffusion in temperature space .",
    "this set is not self  averaging , and consequently requires a manual fine tuning for each realization of the quenched variables .",
    "this is impractical if one wants to collect results from enough replicas to calculate reliable averages . to solve this problem in an automatic way",
    ", we made use of an adaptive simulated  tempering scheme developed in ref .",
    "starting from a high temperature , this algorithm performs a set of simulated  tempering samplings , adding iteratively lower temperatures , which are optimized self  consistently .",
    "an example of this procedure results in a sampling of different temperatures as that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperatures ] , which allows to calculate equilibrium averages of polymers up to @xmath19 monomers .    from the study of the looping probabilities of heteropolymers of different length , correctly averaged , we obtained the scaling behaviour as a function of the average interaction @xmath17 and the temperature @xmath20 , setting @xmath21 as reference energy . in the calculations",
    ", we chose @xcite @xmath22 ( in units of the length of the link between consecutive beads ) , @xmath23 and a contact between the ends of the chain is defined if they are closer than @xmath15 .",
    "in order to find the most appropriate way of calculating the scaling properties of the looping probability of a random heteropolymer , one can use a two  state model .",
    "one can assume that the bound and unbound states display , respectively , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath25 are quenched random variables regarded as the sum of the internal contact energies of the chain , while @xmath27 is the interaction energy between the ends of the chain .",

    "this weighting is a consequence of the extensivity of the energy of the chain and has as consequence that larger@xmath0 points contribute less to the determination of @xmath38 .",
    "the average @xmath45 of a conformational property @xmath46 of the random heteropolymer over the quenched stochastic energies provides valuable information only if the associated standard error @xmath47 is small , namely if the quantity is self  averaging @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", this corresponds to the condition @xmath48    usually extensive properties are self  averaging @xcite , while intensive properties , probability distributions and partition functions are not .",
    "thus , we do not expect @xmath49 to be self  averaging , and in fact @xmath50 is quite large , increasing above 1 quite fast as a function of @xmath0 at low temperatures ( cf .",
    "[ fig : selfav]a ) .",
    "this is the reason why in the context of disordered systems one focuses the attention on free energies .",
    "however , in the present case we are considering a free  energy difference between two states of the system , which is expected to scale as @xmath43 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cn ] ) . the associated self  averaging parameter thus scales as @xmath51 , which has a non  monotonic behaviour as a function of @xmath0 , eventually diverging in the thermodynamic limit , although not very fast ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : selfav]b ) .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , @xmath40 is not self  averaging . nor it is any quantity which can be derived by the contact probability @xmath52 .",
    "however , if one is interested in finite systems of the typical size of biopolymers , a sufficient request is that the variability of @xmath40 associated with the disorder is smaller than its average , that is @xmath53 in a specified interval of @xmath0 .    equation ( [ eq : pf ] ) suggests that the variability of @xmath40 over the quenched disorder should follow @xmath54 and consequently display a divergence at @xmath55 $ ] and a minimum at @xmath56 $ ] , diverging at large @xmath0 ( cf .",

    "a similar behaviour is observed for the gyration radius @xmath62 of the polymer ( see fig . [",

    "from the same simulations used to estimate the degree of self  averageness , we calculated the values of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath0 , in order to estimate its scaling properties .",

    "interpreting eq .",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) as the likelihood of observing a value of @xmath40 in a chain of specified length , the quality of the linear fit can be expressed in terms of the average log  likelihood , that is nothing else but @xmath68 where @xmath0 is the length of the longest chain considered in the fit and @xmath69 .",

    "however , even at low temperatures the value of @xmath70 remains lower than 1 for all the @xmath0 studied , indicating that the fitting line matches the points within their error bars .",
    "this is a result of the fact that both the estimation of @xmath38 and the quantification @xmath70 of the error of the fit emphasize smaller polymers becuase for them the variability of @xmath40 due to the disordered interactions is smaller . in the case of longer polymers",

    "the scaling of @xmath63 below the @xmath78point with exponents lower than @xmath81 is a finite  size effect , also present in homopolymers ( cf .",

    "[ sect : selfav ] ) , and consequently we can study its average @xmath87 over the realizations of the disordered interaction . on the other hand , it is complicated by the small size of the system , while a globule  coil phase transition is defined , strictly speaking , only for an infinitely  long polymer .",

    "for @xmath88 the curves overlap almost perfectly to each other , with a slope of @xmath89 , that of a random coil in the case of a homopolymer .",
    "this is not unexpected , since at high temperature the heterogeneity in the interactions within the chain becomes negligible with respect to @xmath20 , and the heteropolymer behaves effectively as a homopolymer .    for temperatures @xmath90 the slope of @xmath91 versus @xmath43 decreases and reaches @xmath11 , the value that homopolymers display at the @xmath78point , at @xmath92 .",
    "if one decreases the temperature further , the curve is no longer linear in the range of @xmath0 under consideration .",
