    "by providing a huge spectroscopic quasar database , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has spurred a renewed interest in large quasar absorption - line surveys ( e.g. , reichard et al .",
    "2003 ; nestor , turnshek , & rao 2005 , hereafter ntr05 ; prochaska , herbert - fort , & wolfe 2005 ; rao , turnshek , & nestor 2006 ; mcdonald et al .  2006 ; york et al .",
    "such surveys not only improve the statistics of quasar absorption lines ( in some cases by several orders of magnitude ) , but their large sizes also allow for the discovery of rare systems .",
    "for example , surveys for intervening absorbers such as ntr05 and nestor et al .",
    "( in preparation ) have discovered significant numbers of rare `` ultra - strong '' absorption systems , having @xmath13 rest - frame equivalent widths 3 @xmath14@xmath3@xmath15  .",
    "systems of this strength are 50 to @xmath16 times more rare than those with @xmath3@xmath17  , which is a customary division between `` weak '' and `` strong '' absorbers .",
    "previous spectroscopic surveys were of insufficient size to detect a very useful number of absorbers at these strengths .",
    "therefore , ultra - strong absorbers represent a virtually unstudied phenomena .",
    "the nature of the environments of less - strong absorbers have been the subject of many studies .",
    "churchill , kacprzak , & steidel ( 2005 ) have reviewed our understanding of systems with 0.1   @xmath18@xmath3@xmath19  .",
    "these absorbers are found to be associated with the halos of galaxies that span a range of morphological type , luminosity and impact parameter , but tend towards galaxies with @xmath20 and impact parameters 15 kpc @xmath21 80 kpc .",
    "recent results ( e.g. , tripp & bowen 2005 ) also suggest that the covering fraction for strong absorption at these impact parameters is significantly less than unity ( perhaps @xmath22 ) . moreover , rao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that a substantial fraction of systems with @xmath3  @xmath23   are damped ly@xmath8 ( dla ) absorbers , which have neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath24 atoms @xmath25 .",
    "rao et al.(2003 and references therein ) have discussed imaging results on @xmath26 dla galaxies , finding that low - luminosity and/or low surface brightness dwarfs contribute substantially to this subset of strong absorbers .",
    "at least three dlas with particularly strong ( 2.5   @xmath18@xmath3@xmath27  ) absorption have been imaged : the q0827 + 243 ( @xmath28 ) absorber is associated with an @xmath29 spiral at @xmath30 kpc ( rao et al.2003 ; steidel et al .",
    "2002 ) ; the q1137 + 3907 absorber ( @xmath31 ) is associated with a sub-@xmath32 star - forming galaxy at @xmath33 kpc and one or two possible sub-@xmath32 neighbors ( lacy et al .",
    "2003 ) ; and the q1209 + 107 absorber ( @xmath34 ) has a galaxy in the field that is @xmath35 at @xmath36 kpc ( le brun et al .",
    "1997 ) , assuming it is at the absorber redshift .    for strong and at least partially saturated absorption lines , rest equivalent widths ( rews )",
    "give an approximate indication of the projected velocity spread , @xmath37 , of the absorbing gas , with completely black saturated @xmath13 lines providing a lower - limit of @xmath38 @xmath3 km s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , ultra - strong absorbers exhibit strong / saturated absorption over a ( lower - limit ) projected velocity spread of @xmath39 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the kinematic spread seen in galactic absorbers in quasar spectra , which have a projected velocity extent along a sightline of @xmath40 km s@xmath7 ( savage et al .",
    "2000 ) .    though few individual ultra - strong absorbers have been studied in detail , some of their properties are known .",
    "zibetti et al.(submitted to apj ) demonstrate that stronger absorbers are on average bluer and at smaller impact parameter .",
    "mnard et al .",
    "( in preparation ) show that the amount of reddening of the background quasar by the absorber is strongly correlated with rew , and nestor et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and turnshek et al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrate that the gas - phase metallicity and depletion of refractory elements in absorbers are strongly correlated with @xmath3 .",
    "thus , these systems are , on average , relatively metal - rich and dusty compared to weaker absorbers .",
    "indeed , the most metal - rich known dla absorbers all have 2   @xmath41@xmath3@xmath42 3  . however , the results of rao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and ntr05 indicate that , while it is likely that a large fraction of ultra - strong absorption systems ( perhaps @xmath43 ) have neutral hydrogen column densities above the dla threshold of n ( ) @xmath44 atoms @xmath25 , most ( perhaps @xmath45 ) dlas have @xmath3@xmath42 3  .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the range of galaxy types associated with these two overlapping classes of absorption system .",
    "aside from the clear empirical connection to dla absorbers , other authors have speculated on the nature of the strongest absorbers . as a possible explanation for systems with 0.9",
    "  @xmath41@xmath3@xmath46    that exhibit `` double - trough '' absorption profiles in higher resolution data , churchill et al.(2000 ) investigated the probability of a line of sight passing through galaxy pairs such as the milky way and either the lmc or smc .",
    "in this regard , if the strongest absorbers do indeed trace interacting pairs , their incidence and properties could have important impact on our understanding of hierarchical formation scenarios .",
    "in addition , bond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) investigated the possibility that galactic superwinds give rise to sets of absorbers with 1.8   @xmath41@xmath3@xmath47  .",
    "confirmation of this connection would provide an important tool for the study of the evolution of global star formation and star - forming galaxies .",
    "nestor , turnshek , & rao ( 2006 ) discuss evidence in support of both superwinds and interactions as possible mechanisms causing ultra - strong absorbers .",
    "both of these connections would also have potentially important impact on the understanding of environmental effects such as the distribution of metals into the igm ( e.g. , through galactic fountains ) .",
    "while there are many examples of the association between less - strong absorption and galaxies with small impact parameters , the sightlines do not in general pass through the optically luminous extent of the galaxies .",
    "the simplest possible explanation for ultra - strong absorbers may therefore be that these systems select sightlines passing through the inner regions of the disks as well as the halos of massive galaxies .",
    "however , even if this is indeed the case , the processes responsible for the very large kinematic spreads would still require explanation .",
    "thus , depending on the nature of ultra - strong absorbers , they may have important implications for our understanding of dla galaxies , massive galaxies , galaxy clustering , major and minor mergers , the evolution of starburst galaxies , and metals in the igm .",
    "it is clearly of interest to determine the physical processes responsible for these rare and extreme systems with strong low - ion gas absorption over such a large interval of rest - frame velocity .",
    "consequently , in order to constrain the nature of ultra - strong absorbers , we have initiated a program to study the associated galaxies and environments through optical imaging . targeted follow - up spectroscopy of individual galaxies in the fields",
    "should follow . here",
    "we present wiyn @xmath0 or @xmath1 images of the fields towards 15 quasars exhibiting absorbers with 2.69   @xmath48@xmath3@xmath49   and @xmath50 , and we discuss the properties of the sample of detected galaxies .",
    "we describe our observations in ",
    "[ section : obser ] , the results in   [ section : results ] , discuss the implications of this work in   [ section : discussion ] , and present our conclusions in   [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "we conducted observations at the wiyn telescope on kitt peak , arizona , using the wiyn tip - tilt module and the sdss @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters .",
    "we imaged quasar fields containing strong and ultra - strong absorbers detected in sdss quasar spectra .",
    "for the eight absorbers with @xmath51 we used the @xmath0 filter , and for the seven absorbers with @xmath52 we used the @xmath1 filter to ensure that the 4000 break was not redshifted into the filter bandpass .",
    "we were awarded two nights each in february of 2005 and january of 2006 , although one and a half nights were lost to weather , and one night had rather poor seeing .",
    "the final night , however , had fair to good seeing throughout . in all , we were able to obtain usable images of 15 fields , though as indicated below the seeing quality was quite heterogeneous .",
    "we obtained at least three images of each field in order to facilitate removal of cosmic rays , and total exposure times were between 60 and 100 minutes per field . the quasar point spread function ( psf )",
    "was well behaved in most of our images , and bright , unsaturated stars allowed for the modelling and removal of the quasar psf in all but two cases .",
    "we used the software package sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) to detect , deblend , and measure sources in each of our fields .",
    "all regions having at least 15 contiguous pixels with fluxes 1.5@xmath53 above the background were extracted .",
    "we calibrated our photometry using sdss imaging results on available bright objects in each field . in table",
    "[ table : photometry ] we list all resolved objects detected within an impact parameter of @xmath54 kpc of the quasar sightlines under the assumption that the objects are at the absorption redshift .",
    "uncertainties in the magnitudes were generally @xmath55 mag , resulting in better than 10% photometric accuracy .",
    "all cosmology - dependent quantities are computed assuming @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "absolute magnitudes ( and luminosities ) for our detections were determined using three different @xmath59-corrections for galaxy types sc , sa , and e. galaxy impact parameter , @xmath11 , and sizes are also given in table  [ table : photometry ] .",
    "the apparent projected optical extents ( i.e. , the luminous `` sizes '' of galaxies ) are listed as the major - axis @xmath60 minor - axis of the sextractor - fitted ellipse , which corresponds to the source s approximate isophotal limit . we note that the ellipses drawn on each image in figures 2 - 16 are the photometric integration limits and correspond to twice the isophotal limit .    for ease of discussion , as well as to facilitate comparison of absolute magnitudes independent of filter",
    ", we also list luminosities relative to those for the `` characteristic '' absolute magnitudes , @xmath61 , from schechter function fits to the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) . whereas the actual calculated value of @xmath61 ( or @xmath32 ) is correlated with the calculated faint - end slope of the lf , and varies from study to study ( see table 1 of brown et al .",
    ", 2001 , for example ) , we stress that the the physically meaningful quantities are the relative number - densities of galaxies as a function of luminosity , which do not depend on the actual value of @xmath61 . for our purposes ,",
    "we adopt values for @xmath61 determined from the sdss for the relatively local universe ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) from blanton et al . , 2003 .",
    "in our cosmology , these correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we note that these values are for sdss filters @xmath59-corrected to @xmath65 , making them perhaps non - ideal for direct comparison . however , these values have the advantages of being calculated from the same data set to which we have calibrated our photometry and , more importantly , have very similar number - densities ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) which allows for meaningful comparisons between our two filters .",
    "furthermore , the value for @xmath67 matches that used in at least some previous work ( e.g. , rao et al . , 2003 ) . unless otherwise stated , @xmath32 corresponds to these values throughout this work . for comparison , in the extremely local ( @xmath68 mpc @xmath69mpc ) universe , blanton et al .",
    ", 2005 find @xmath67 and @xmath70 to be approximately 36% and 47% fainter than the above values , respectively .",
    "the absorption region of each spectrum is shown in figure  [ specs ] .",
    "note that the sdss spectra reach a minimum redshift of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , there is no absorption information available below this redshift . above this value ,",
    "the signal to noise ratios of the spectra were such that our formal @xmath3  detection threshold was typically between 0.4   and 1  , though for @xmath72 this value typically rises to between 0.6  and 2  due to increased noise at the blue end of the spectral coverage .",
    "figures  [ show our wiyn images .",
    "all are centered on the quasar sightlines and oriented such that north is to the top and east is to the left .",
    "they are sized so that they span 420 kpc @xmath60 420 kpc at the absorption redshift .",
    "the location of each sightline is marked with a `` x '' and unresolved objects classified as stars are labelled with an `` s '' . in all but two cases ( q0800 + 2150 and q0902 + 3722 ) the point spread function ( psf )",
    "was determined well enough from stars in the field that it was subtracted at the quasar position ( hence the quasar appears to disappear in 13 of the 15 fields ) .",

    "quasar names are specified as coordinate designations relative to equinox 2000 , but the formal sdss quasar names are also listed in the text .",
    "in our discussion of each field we emphasise what we consider to be the most likely interpretation , keeping in mind that ultra - strong absorbers are rare and may select correspondingly rare galaxy types and/or environments . due to our lack of confirmed redshifts for almost all of the galaxies in these fields ,",
    "all of these interpretations should be considered preliminary . however , in many cases there is clearly good circumstantial evidence for our proposed interpretation .",

    "surprisingly , almost half of the images in our sample appear similar to fields selected by less - strong absorbers , i.e. , in the `` normal '' category .",
    "thus , we have little additional evidence to diagnose the cause of the large kinematics seen in absorption for those systems .",
    "it is therefore possible that some ultra - strong systems simply represent the tail of the distribution of galaxy kinematics and chance alignment of the sightline with many low - ionization absorbing clouds in the galaxy halo .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the findings of rao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where they find that , while the fraction of absorbers that are dlas increases with increasing @xmath3 , not all ultra - strong systems are dlas . in this picture ,",
    "an increasing number of kinematically - distinct `` clouds '' intercepted by the sightline increases both the observed @xmath3  and the likelihood that at least one of the clouds exhibits a column density above the dla threshold .",
    "five to seven of our images reveal the presence of a galaxy overlapping ( or nearly so ) the sightline .",
    "this raises the question of whether many ultra - strong systems might simply select sightlines through the inner regions ( as opposed to the extended - halos ) of normal galaxies .",
    "however , galactic absorption seen against quasars has only a median @xmath343 (savage et al .",
    "2000 ) which corresponds to @xmath344 km s@xmath7 .",
    "these systems , of course , sample only roughly half of a complete sightline through the galactic disk . nonetheless , the absorption kinematics tend to be at most only slightly asymmetric about the local standard of rest . to account for the asymmetry",
    ", we use the minimum / maximum velocity limits of each absorber given by savage et al .  to estimate that a full line of sight through the disk would only increase the observed absorption strengths by @xmath6 10% to 50% , and in no case more than @xmath670% .",
    "thus , it is not expected that the milky way would produce an ultra - strong absorber , even with a sightline passing through the entire disk at the solar locus .",
    "if there is a significant intermediate redshift population with smaller velocity spreads ( i.e. , smaller @xmath3 values ) but having similar overlapping galaxy  sightline pairs , the discrepancy would simply be due to our observing only ultra - strong systems .",
    "the absence of this population , however , would mean that our sample is fairly representative and would imply that galaxies containing significant amounts of neutral / low - ion gas at @xmath306 were in general kinematically more complex than the milky way .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of ntr05 whereby the total proper cross section for absorption by ultra - strong absorbers is decreasing with decreasing redshift , especially for @xmath76 , indicating a larger incidence of ultra - strong systems at intermediate redshift compared to the present epoch .",
    "we also note that this difference is consistent with the decreasing global star formation rate from @xmath345 , which may be relevant if the kinematics are driven by star formation .    using hst acs images , kacprzak , churchill , & steidel ( 2005 )",

    "in addition , the evidence for @xmath277 galaxies with @xmath342 kpc has interesting consequences .",
    "if these galaxies are confirmed to be starburst galaxies at @xmath347 , they would represent an intermediate stage between the high redshift starburst population ( i.e. , lyman - break galaxies ) , which exhibit a characteristic rest frame optical luminosity @xmath348-@xmath349 ( shapley et al .",
