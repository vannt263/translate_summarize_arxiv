    "the stability and spreading kinetics of ultrathin wetting films on solid substrates are of technological and scientific importance in many applications ranging from coatings , paints , dielectric layers , thin film lubrication , microelectronic devices , to fundamental studies of adsorption and particle dynamics @xcite . in the case of homogeneous , chemically pure substrates ,",
    "the properties of such films are relatively well understood through a series of experimental and theoretical works @xcite .",
    "however , most of the naturally occurring surfaces used in thin film experiments are chemically heterogeneous on nanometer to micrometer scales , e.g. due to contamination , cavities , uneven oxide layer , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "deliberately tailored chemically heterogeneous substrates are also increasingly being used for engineering of desired nano- and micropatterns in thin films ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", some recent studies have revealed a possibility of controlling the growth of biological systems by attaching them to structured surfaces @xcite and to recognize biological molecules , ( e.g. , proteins ) , selectively by bringing them into contact with nanostructured surfaces @xcite .    a considerable amount of recent theoretical , numerical and experimental work has been devoted to the analysis of @xmath9 properties of thin films on chemically heterogeneous substrates .",
    "these studies focused mostly on such issues as stability of films , pattern formation , appearance of self - organized structures , as well as the impact of chemical disorder on the contact angle and appropriate generalization of the young s equation @xcite .",
    "much less is known , however , on spreading kinetics of ultrathin liquid films on chemically disordered surfaces . here ,",
    "the only available studies concern molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and experimental analysis @xcite of precursor films spreading on substrates with chemically impure sites . to the best of our knowledge , no theoretical analysis has been as yet performed .    in the present paper , motivated by recent experimental studies of precursor films spreading on chemically disordered substrates @xcite , we analyse the spreading kinetics of molecularly thin films on substrates with randomly placed chemically active sites .",
    "we focus here on systems with the so - called planar geometry , i.e. on systems in which film s thickness ( or concentration of particles in the film in case of monolayers ) varies effectively only along one spatial coordinate .",
    "this typical experimental situation occurs when a solid , which may be a plane or a cylindrical fiber , is immersed in a liquid bath . here",
    ", the particle concentration in the liquid film , which extracts from the macroscopic meniscus and climbs along the solid , varies only with the altitude above the edge of the macroscopic meniscus and is independent of the perpendicular , horizontal coordinate .",
    "the meniscus then serves as a reservoir of particles , which is in equilibrium with the spreading monolayer and `` feeds '' it .",
    "the solid substrate is modeled here in a usual fashion as a regular , square lattice of adsorption sites ; chemical heterogeneity is introduced by adding some concentration @xmath0 of special , chemically active sites , which temporarily trap moving particles which then become obstacles for others .",
    "we analyse here , both analytically and numerically , the behavior of the mean displacement @xmath1 of the monolayer edge . in terms of a mean - field - type approach , we find that @xmath1 grows with time @xmath2 as @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 being the lattice spacing ) .",
    "this time dependence , which contains a non - trivial logarithmic factor , is confirmed by the numerical simulations .",
    "as well , we obtain @xmath5 numerically for a wide range of values of chemical sites concentration @xmath0 and of the trapping times .",
    "we also consider the situation when our substrate is of a finite extent along the @xmath10-axis and study numerically the behavior of the stationary particle current .",
    "the question of the influence of attractive particle - particle interactions on spreading kinetics is also addressed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we formulate a microscopic stochastic model of spreading kinetics . in section 3",
    "we derive basic equations and present their mean - field - type solution appropriate for situations with annealed spatial distribution of the chemically active sites . in section 4",
    "we describe our monte carlo simulations model .",
    "results of monte carlo simulations of spreading kinetics of monolayers composed of hard - core particles and analysis of the behavior of the particle current in finite samples are presented in section 5 .",
    "next , in section 6 we consider spreading behavior in the case when the monolayer particles experience short - range , nearest - neighbor attractive interactions .",
    "finally , in section 7 we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "as we have already remarked , our model is relevant to the following experimental situation .",
    "suppose that a vertical solid wall is immersed in a bath of liquid .",
    "the liquid interface , which is initially horizontal , changes its shape in the vicinity of the solid wall and a macroscopic meniscus builds up .",
    "the size of the macroscopic meniscus ( both horizontally and vertically ) is comparable to the capillary length . after a suitable transient period an ultrathin liquid film ( a monolayer ) exudes from the static macroscopic meniscus and climbs up the solid wall @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a microscopic stochastic model describing spreading kinetics of molecular films on chemically homogeneous , ideal substrates has been developed .",
    "here we extend this approach on the situation when chemical disorder is present .",
    "particles dynamics on the solid surface is generally regarded as an activated random hopping motion , constrained by hard - core interactions , between the local minima of a wafer - like array of potential wells .",
    "such wells occur because the monolayer s particles experience short - range forces exerted by the atoms of the solid .",
    "consequently , the interwell distance @xmath4 is related to the spacing between the atoms of the substrate . without going into details of the particle - substrate interactions ,",
    "we suppose that for the transition to one of the neighboring potential wells a particle has to overcome a potential barrier .",
    "this barrier does not create a preferential hopping direction , but results in a finite time interval @xmath11 between the consecutive hops , defined through the arrhenius formula .    to specify the positions of the wells",
    ", we introduce a pair of perpendicular coordinate axes ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath10 is a vertical coordinate , which measures the altitude of a given well above the meniscus ( a reservoir ) , while @xmath13 defines the horizontal position of this well . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the lattice of potential wells is a regular square lattice of spacing @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . it will be made clear below that the effects we observe do not drastically depend on the precise form of the underlying lattice .    further on",
    ", we assume that the substrate contains some concentration @xmath0 of immobile , chemically active sites , placed at random positions . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the spatial distribution of these sites is commensurate with the underlying lattice of potential wells , such that the chemically active sites can be viewed as occupying random positions on the sites of the square lattice exactly ( see , fig .",
    "1 ) .    we turn next to the definition of the hopping probabilities .",
    "we suppose that the latter are symmetric regardless of whether a particle occupies an ordinary or a chemically active site . in the former case ,",
    "a particle chooses a jump direction with the same probability equal to @xmath14 , which means that being on ordinary site a particle always attempts to perform a hop . on the contrary , in the latter case",
    ", there is a probability that the particle stays at the site  a pausing probability @xmath15 , which mirrors the chemical specificity of sites and hence , results in a temporal trapping effect . here",
    ", the particle selects the jump direction with probability @xmath16 , where the parameter @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath17 @xmath18 being the temperature measured in the units of the boltzmann constant @xmath19 , while @xmath20 denotes the trapping energy , @xmath21 .",
    "note that the typical time @xmath22 spent by a given particle being trapped by a chemically active site is just @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the site - dependent jump direction probabilities @xmath24 can be written down as @xmath25 after the jump direction is chosen , the particle attempts to hop onto the target site .",
    "the jump is fulfilled if the target site is empty at this moment of time ; otherwise , the particle remains at its position .",
    "finally , we view the liquid bath as a reservoir of particles ( of an infinite capacity ) which maintains a constant concentration @xmath26 of fluid particles at the edge of the macroscopic meniscus , i.e. the line @xmath27 in fig . 1 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . here , for simplicity , we take @xmath28 .",
    "the behavior for arbitrary @xmath26 will be considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we hasten to remark that dynamics in disordered lattice gas - type models , relevant to the one employed here , has been extensively studied within different contexts , including , for instance , charge carrier transport in dynamic percolating systems @xcite , tracer diffusion within the first layers of solid surfaces @xcite and in adsorbed monolayers @xcite , tracer and collective diffusion on solid surfaces @xcite , in pure and disordered crystals @xcite or collective diffusion in zeolites @xcite .",
    "the systems analyzed in these works differ , however , considerably from the situation under study ; here we present a first , to the best of our knowledge , lattice gas - type description of @xmath29 dynamics of monolayers on substrates with chemical disorder .    to close this section it might be instructive to discuss the limitations of such a non - interacting lattice - gas - type model . in the `` real world '' systems , the particles appearing on top of a solid substrate ",
    "adsorbed particles , experience two types of interactions : namely , interactions with the atoms of the underlying solid  the solid - particle ( sp ) interactions , and mutual interactions with each other  the particle - particle ( pp ) interactions .",
    "the sp interactions are characterized by a repulsion at short scales , and an attraction at longer distances .",
    "the repulsion keeps the adsorbed particles some distance apart of the solid , while attraction favors adsorption and hinders particles desorption as well as migration along the solid surface . in this",
    "regard , our model corresponds to the regime of the so - called intermediate localized adsorption @xcite : the particles forming a monolayer are neither completely fixed in the potential wells created by the sp interactions , nor completely mobile .",
    "this means , the potential wells are rather deep with respect to the particles desorption ( desorption barrier @xmath30 ) , so that only an adsorbed monolayer can exist , but have a much lower energy barrier @xmath31 against the lateral movement across the surface , @xmath32 . in this regime",
    ", any monolayer particle spends a considerable part of its time at the bottom of a potential well and jumps sometimes , solely due to the thermal activation , from one potential minimum to another in its neighborhood ; after the jump is performed , the particle dissipates all its energy to the host solid .",
    "thus , on a macroscopic time scale the particles do not possess any velocity .",
    "the time @xmath33 separating two successive jump events , is just the typical time a given particle spends in a given well vibrating around its minimum ; as we have already remarked , @xmath33 is related to the temperature , the barrier for the lateral motion and the frequency of the solid atoms vibrations by the arrhenius formula .",
    "we emphasize that such a type of random motion is essentially different from the standard hydrodynamic picture of particles random motion in the two - dimensional `` bulk '' liquid phase , e.g. in free - standing liquid films , in which case there is a velocity distribution and spatially @xmath34 motion results from the pp scattering . in this case",
    ", the dynamics can be only approximately considered as an activated hopping of particles , confined to some effective cells by the potential field of their neighbors , along a lattice - like structure of such cells ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "in contrast to the dynamical model to be studied here , standard two - dimensional hydrodynamics presumes that the particles do not interact with the underlying solid . in realistic systems , of course , both the particle - particle scattering and scattering by the potential wells due to the interactions with the host solid , ( as well as the corresponding dissipation channels ) , are important @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that addition of dissipation to the host solid removes the infrared divergencies in the dynamic density correlation functions and thus makes the transport coefficients finite @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", homogeneous adsorbed monolayers may only exist in systems in which the attractive part of the pp interaction potential is essentially weaker than that describing interactions with the solid ; otherwise , such monolayers become unstable and dewet spontaneously from the solid surface . as a matter of fact , for stable homogeneous monolayers ,",
    "the pp interactions are at least ten times weaker that the interactions with the solid atoms @xcite .",
    "consequently , the standard hydrodynamic picture of particles dynamics is inappropriate under the defined above physical conditions .",
    "contrary to that , any adsorbed particle moves due to random hopping events , activated by chaotic vibrations of the solid atoms , along the local minima of an array of potential wells , created due to the interactions with the solid @xcite .",
    "as we have already remarked , in the physical conditions under which such a dynamics takes place , the pp interactions are much weaker than the sp interactions and hence do not perturb significantly the regular array of potential wells due to the sp interactions . in our model , we discard completely the attractive part of the pp interaction potential and take into account only the repulsive one , which is approximated by an abrupt , hard - core - type potential",
    ".    the question of the monolayer spreading in the case when some short - range attractive particle - particle interactions are present will be briefly addressed in section 6 .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the local density of the monolayer particles at time moment @xmath2 at the site @xmath36 .",
    "this local density obeys the following balance equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes a nearest - neighboring to @xmath36 site , while the summation symbol with the subscript @xmath38 means that the summation extends over all nearest to @xmath36 sites .",
    "note that the factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) account for the steric constraints due to hard - core interactions and represent the ( decoupled ) probabilities that the target sites are unoccupied at time moment @xmath2 .",
    "equation ( [ q ] ) holds for all particles except for the rightmost particles for each fixed @xmath13 , since for the latter , by definition , the hops away of the monolayer ( i.e. such that increase their @xmath10 position to @xmath41 ) are not constrained by the hard - core interactions .",
    "let now @xmath42 denote the @xmath10-position of the rightmost particle in the column with fixed @xmath13 .",
    "evidently , one has for @xmath43 the following equation @xmath44 + p(x_0(y , t)-a , y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which thus has a different structure compared to eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "note that the last term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is not multiplied by neither the occupation factor @xmath45 nor by the steric factor @xmath46 .",
    "this happens , namely , because the last term describes the event in which the rightmost particle , present , by definition , at the site @xmath47 , ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , hops at the vacant site @xmath1 , ( i.e. @xmath49 ) .",
    "we turn next to the mean - field - type picture assuming first that chemically active sites are uniformly spread along the substrate with mean density @xmath0 , and @xmath24 is a position - independent constant @xmath50 an estimate of @xmath51 will be presented below .",
    "then , we note that the dependences of @xmath35 on the @xmath10 and the @xmath13 coordinates have quite different origins .",
    "there is a reservoir of particles , which maintains fixed occupation of all sites at @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , we may expect a regular @xmath10-dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath13-dependence may be only noise ; the uniform boundary at the @xmath27 insures that there is no regular dependence on the @xmath13 coordinate and , in absence of disorder in the jump direction probabilities , only the particle dynamics may cause fluctuations in @xmath35 along the @xmath13-axis . hence , following ref . @xcite we will disregard these fluctuations and suppose that the local density varies along the @xmath10-axis only , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , we will have an effectively one - dimensional problem in which the presence of the @xmath13-direction will be accounted only through the particles dynamics .",
    "we note finally that assumption of such a type is , in fact , quite consistent with experimental observations @xcite , which show that in case of sufficiently smooth substrates and liquids with low volatility the width of the film s front is very narrow .",
    "then , in neglect of the fluctuations along the @xmath13-axis the variable @xmath53 can be viewed as a local time - dependent variable describing occupation of the site @xmath10 in a @xmath54 @xmath55 in which hard - core particles perform hopping motion ( with a time interval @xmath56 between the consecutive hops ) on a one - dimensional lattice of spacing @xmath4 connected , at the site @xmath27 , to a particle reservoir which maintains constant occupation of this site .    for @xmath57 ,",
    "characteristics of such a process are then described by the following nonlinear system of coupled equations .",
    "the mean displacement of the rightmost particle ( the monolayer edge ) obeys : @xmath58 where @xmath53 is determined by @xmath59 which holds for @xmath60 and is to be solved subject to two boundary conditions : @xmath61 and @xmath62 these two boundary conditions mimic , first , the presence of a particle reservoir , and second , show that for the rightmost particles of the monolayer the jumps away of the monolayer are not constrained by hard - core interactions .",
    "we note now that eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) to ( [ m2 ] ) constitute a classical mathematical problem of solving a partial differential equation with one of the boundaries being imposed in the moving frame , which is akin to the so - called stefan problem .",
    "its solution can be found in a standard way by observing that the density profiles @xmath53 written in terms of the scaling variable @xmath63 become stationary . in the limit @xmath57 ,",
    "the mean displacement of the monolayer edge thus follows @xmath64 where @xmath5 is given by @xmath65 in a similar fashion , one finds that the total number m(t ) of particles , @xmath66 emerged on the substrate up to time @xmath2 , obeys @xmath67 which implies that the mean density in the monolayer slowly decreases with time @xmath68 note that dependence of @xmath69 on disorder , which enters only through the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath5 is logarithmically weak .",
    "note also that the mean displacement @xmath1 of the monolayer edge grows at a faster rate than the conventionally expected pure diffusive @xmath70-law due to an additional factor @xmath71 ; consequently , fitting of experimental curves or numerical results with a pure @xmath70-law is meaningless since the effective diffusion coefficient will appear to depend on time of observation . in fig .",
    "2 we present numerical evidence of this additional logarithmic factor . in fig .",
    "3 we depict numerical results describing the behavior of @xmath5 .",
    "analytical estimates of @xmath5 will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that within the employed mean - field dynamical approach , we can also obtain an average stationary particles current @xmath72 .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) subject to the reservoir boundary condition in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , as well as imposing a trapping boundary condition at the right edge of the substrate , @xmath73 , we find that @xmath74 i.e. the current has a fickian dependence on the substrate s length .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath75 can be estimated within a mean - field - type approximation as follows : in the stationary state it matters actually how much time , on average , a given particle spends on a given lattice site .",
    "such an average time is , evidently , @xmath76 where the first term represents a contribution of ordinary sites , while the second one gives an average time spent by a given particle on chemically active sites .",
    "consequently , the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath75 can be estimated as @xmath77 this result is , of course , exact for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e. for chemically homogeneous substrates .",
    "it appears that it describes reasonably well ( see fig .",
    "4 ) the numerical data for @xmath80 and arbitrary @xmath15 , as well for small values of @xmath15 and arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "in our simulation algorithm , we follow closely the model defined in section 2 .",
    "we consider a square lattice @xmath81 with linear sizes @xmath82 and @xmath83 and with every lattice site @xmath36 we associate an occupation variable @xmath84 which may assume only two values @xmath85 .",
    "the value @xmath86 signifies that the site @xmath36 is occupied , while @xmath87 means that this site is vacant .",
    "the initial configuration is an empty lattice except for the zeroth raw ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the left edge of the system @xmath27 is coupled to a particle reservoir which keeps the zeroth raw always occupied ( @xmath88 ) , i.e. @xmath89 . in the @xmath13-direction periodic boundary conditions",
    "are imposed to reduce the finite - size effects .",
    "the right edge of the system is coupled to an empty reservoir , so that the raw @xmath90 is always empty .",
    "note that such a formulation allows us to study both dynamic and static characteristics .",
    "while studying spreading dynamics , we take @xmath82 sufficiently large and take care that displacement of the rightmost particle in each column @xmath13 is less than @xmath91 .",
    "when studying the behavior of the stationary particle current , we focus on @xmath82 not that large and let the system evolve until the density profiles in the system attain a stationary state .    the following time - saving procedure has been implemented . at every non - normalized time step",
    "@xmath92 a particle in the system is chosen at random .",
    "let the particle s coordinates be denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "then the particle may either stay at the site @xmath36 with probability @xmath93 , or with an equal probability , @xmath94 , may attempt to jump onto one of the neighboring sites , chosen at random .",
    "the jump is actually fulfilled if the target site is empty .",
    "otherwise , the particle remains at the site @xmath36 .",
    "if the initial site is in the zeroth raw and if after the update the particle moves it is immediately filled by a particle from the reservoir and the number of particles @xmath95 in the system is increased .",
    "if the initial site is in the last raw @xmath96 and if after the update the particle moves to @xmath97 the number of particles in the system is decreased . the time is renormalized according to @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the total number of particles in the system at the non - normalized time @xmath100 .",
    "we use the averaged renormalized time in our studies of the time - dependent quantities .",
    "most of the simulations are performed for a system of size @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in units of the lattice constant @xmath4 .",
    "larger system sizes are also considered in few cases .",
    "the results are usually averaged over @xmath104 different substrates and for each substrate @xmath105 different runs are performed .",
    "typical monte carlo simulation lasted @xmath106 mcs per site .",
    "after passing through a transient regime the system reaches a stationary non - equilibrium state characterized by a stationary average particle current @xmath107 flowing through the system and a constant average density gradient .",
    "we studied here how do both , the spreading diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and the diffusion coefficient in the stationary state @xmath75 , depend on the pausing probability @xmath15 and on the concentration @xmath0 of the chemically active sites .",
    "the spreading diffusion coefficient @xmath5 was determined from the time dependence of the average interface position @xmath1 before particles start leaving the right edge of the system .",
    "it appears that the law in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) describes very well the time behavior of the average interface position not only for @xmath108 @xcite , but also for practically the whole interval of values of @xmath0 and @xmath15 , except at @xmath109 , i.e. infinitely deep trapping sites ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    for determination of the diffusion coefficient @xmath75 in the stationary state",
    "we use fick s law , @xmath110 , by measuring the average particle current , @xmath107 ( per site ) , and the average density gradient , @xmath111 , in the stationary state at given pausing probability @xmath15 and concentration @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained results for the spreading diffusion coefficient @xmath5 are presented in fig . 3 and the corresponding results for the diffusion coefficient @xmath75 in the stationary state",
    "are given in fig .",
    "curiously enough , the values found for @xmath5 are always lower then those obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "we turn now to the special case when the pausing probability on chemically active sites is @xmath112 .",
    "the specific feature of this case is that the particle , once arriving at any chemically active site stays there forever , serving then as impenetrable obstacle for the other particles .",
    "it means that in this case one has an induced @xmath113 behavior .",
    "the time behavior of the average interface position for @xmath114 is no longer fitted well by the function in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) ( one expects that here a logarithmic time behavior should take place ) and the above mentioned method can not be employed to determine the spreading diffusion coefficient @xmath5 . for given @xmath0",
    "the averaged density distribution in the stationary state is still constant and @xmath115 . in order to get a reliable estimates for the studied quantities ( e.g. the particle current @xmath107 ) the demand on the computing time as the concentration @xmath116 increases significantly since longer time runs are necessary as well as averaging over more substrates",
    "is needed and finally also bigger systems should be simulated .",
    "the approximate value found for the concentration @xmath117 at which the particle current @xmath107 ( respectively @xmath75 ) turns to zero is consistent with @xmath118 , where @xmath119 @xcite is the critical probability for site percolation in the square lattice ( see fig .",
    "we turn finally to the case when the monolayer particles experience short - range ( nearest - neighbor ) attractive interactions .",
    "let us consider the simplest possible case when the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the constant describing the attraction between two diffusing particles and the summation symbol with the subscript `` ( x,y ) '' means that summation extends over the sites @xmath38 , neighbouring to the site @xmath36 .",
    "we still assume the activation mechanism for the hopping motion of the monolayer particles ; that is , the probability for jump depends on the trapping energy of the site @xmath36 through : @xmath122    we take into consideration the interaction between the diffusing particles by assuming that the particle `` feels '' the other particles when choosing the direction for the jump , i.e. : @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the interaction energy of the particle at the site @xmath36 .    for high enough temperatures one may ,",
    "as a first approximation , try to determine the diffusion coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath75 in the same way as it was done for the non - interacting system .",
    "the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients determined in this way is shown in fig .",
    "as could be seen taking into consideration the interaction between the diffusing particles leads to a decrease of the diffusion coefficients . for higher temperatures",
    "the effect is less pronounced .    for lower temperatures",
    "another method for determining @xmath75 should be employed . while for lower temperatures the time behavior of the average interface position @xmath1 is still reasonably well described by eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , the density distribution along the spreading direction in the stationary state is no longer linear . in fig .",
    "7 the corresponding density distributions ( for homogeneous substrate , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) are shown for three different temperatures for the interacting system in the stationary state .",
    "one can see that at @xmath128 there is clearly a phase separation though there is a stationary particle current flowing through the system .",
    "the interface between the two phases is approximately at @xmath129 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "e.g. @xmath130 the density distribution is getting closer to a linear distribution ( as in the non - interacting case ) but is still not linear .",
    "this system is very similar to the driven diffusive system introduced by katz , lebowitz and spohn @xcite where there is a stationary particle current flowing in the system due to a bias in the transition rates .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the spreading kinetics of a monolayer of hard - core particles on a semi - infinite , chemically heterogeneous solid substrate , one side of which is attached to a reservoir of particles . the substrate is modeled as a square lattice containing two types of sites - ordinary ones and special , chemically actives sites placed at random positions with mean concentration @xmath0 .",
    "these special sites temporarily immobilize the particles of the monolayer which then serve as impenetrable obstacles for the other particles . in terms of a mean - field - type theory ,",
    "we have shown that the mean displacement @xmath1 of the monolayer edge grows with time @xmath2 as @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 being the lattice spacing ) .",
    "this nontrivial time dependence is confirmed by the numerical simulations . for a broad range of values of @xmath0 and of the trapping times of the chemically active sites ( pausing probabilities ) @xmath5 has been obtained from extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "in addition , we have studied numerically the behavior of the stationary particle current in finite samples .",
    "we have observed that , curiously enough , the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 deduced from the analysis of the data on the spreading kinetics , and the one obtained from the analysis of the data on the stationary particle currents , @xmath75 , are different from each other and obey @xmath131 . besides , we have found that the system displays a percolation - type behavior when @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in this limiting case both @xmath5 and @xmath75 vanish .",
    "the question of the influence of attractive particle - particle interactions on spreading kinetics has been also addressed .",
    "we have observed that taking into consideration attractive interactions between the diffusing particles leads to a decrease of the diffusion coefficients . for higher temperatures the effect becomes less pronounced , as it should .",
    "finally , we have found that for sufficiently strong attractions the density distribution along the spreading direction in the stationary state is no longer linear and that there is clearly a phase separation , though the stationary particle current does not vanish .",
