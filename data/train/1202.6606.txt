    "there is a well - known connection between the two notions : the boundary of every convex polytope is a shellable sphere .",
    "this fact was already known in the 1850 s and widely used in the 1880 s  @xcite , although apparently no formal proof appeared until 1970  @xcite .",

    "for example , for each @xmath10 there is a @xmath11-ball whose @xmath10-th barycentric subdivision is still unshellable  @xcite .",
    "an easy consequence of main theorem  [ mainthm : shellablesub ] is the following :    [ mainthm : equivalence ] a simplicial complex has some shellable subdivision if and only if it becomes shellable after suitably many barycentric subdivisions .",

    "this opened doors to algorithmic approaches , see e.g. mijatovi  @xcite or burton  @xcite .    using main theorem [ mainthm : equivalence ] , we can now fully characterize the pl property via shellability of iterated barycentric subdivisions , thus answering a question by ed swartz and lou billera to the second author ; cf .",
