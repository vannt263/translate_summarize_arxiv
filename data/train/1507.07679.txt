    "quantum entanglement entails two important consequences : on the one hand , it is the `` characteristic trait of quantum mechanics '' @xcite that thoroughly thwarts our every day s intuition , most bizarrely when applied to macroscopic objects , as illustrated by the famous paradox of schrdinger s cat @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "entanglement is the very ingredient that makes the simulation of quantum many - body systems extremely challenging : a separable system of @xmath0 qubits requires only @xmath1 parameters for its description , whereas an entangled state comes with @xmath2 variables .",
    "this curse of dimensionality in the context of simulating quantum systems becomes a powerful resource when it comes to the speedup of quantum computers over classical architectures .",
    "although the two aspects of entanglement are two sides of the same medal , they are quantified differently : measures of macroscopicity @xcite reflect the degree to which a quantum state resembles a schrdinger s cat , the complexity of a quantum state is reproduced by the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite , defined via the largest overlap to separable states .",
    "macroscopicity can increase under local operations combined with classical communication ( locc ) @xcite in contrast to geometric entanglement , e.g.  the modestly macroscopic cluster state can be converted via locc into a highly macroscopic ghz - state @xcite .    in nature ,",
    "macroscopic entanglement does not occur @xcite outside artificially tailored situations @xcite .",
    "its empirical absence contrasts with its immediate appearance in the formalism of quantum physics , which raises the question whether some unavoidable mechanism jeopardizes macroscopically entangled quantum states .",
    "the decoherence programme @xcite explains the emergence of classical behavior in our everyday s world and how macroscopic quantum superpositions decohere on overwhelmingly short timescales @xcite : the interaction between any quantum system and its surrounding environment destroys the coherence between macroscopically distinct alternatives  such as the dead and the living cat .",
    "even if the environment were shielded off perfectly , however , it remains unlikely that macroscopic entanglement be observed in nature , due to the unavoidable coarse - graining of any measurement @xcite .",
    "in other words , there are powerful mechanisms that quickly deteriorate macroscopic entanglement .",
    "but the decoherence programme does not make any statement on the likelihood that a macroscopic quantum superposition may form , only that , _ when _ it appears , it decoheres on a timescale so short that any attempt for observation is vain .",
    "would a hypothetical decoherence - free world then host cohorts of schrdinger s cats ?",
    "in other words , how likely are macroscopically entangled quantum states _ before _ the onset of decoherence ?    in order to ease our intuition for these questions ,",
    "let us propose a purely classical analogy : consider the microcanonical ensemble of a gas of @xmath0 particles in a box with total energy @xmath3 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ analogy ] . in classical statistical mechanics , all microstates",
    "( specified by the positions and momenta of the gas particles @xmath4 ) that are compatible with the total energy @xmath3 are assigned the same probability @xcite .",
    "how likely is it to find all particles in the left half of the box , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ analogy](b ) ? in the first place ,",
    "if we prepared the particles in such a state , the system would relax to a homogenous distribution [ fig .",
    "[ analogy](a ) ] on a very short timescale  just like decoherence destroys any macroscopic quantum superposition .",
    "this explanation for the absence of the strongly inhomogeneous situation is , however , not the commonly adopted one : the spontaneous occurrence of the macrostate sketched in fig .  [ analogy](b ) is by itself extremely unlikely , and the relaxation described above is in fact not required to explain its rarity .",
    "there are overwhelmingly more microstates that correspond to a homogeneous distribution ( a ) than for a distribution with all particles on one side ( b ) @xcite .",
    "we can therefore safely neglect the inhomogeneous macrostate and focus on the macrostate with a homogeneous distribution of particles  which is the very basis of statistical mechanics @xcite . in other words , even though there is a powerful mechanism to restore the homogeneity of the gas particles , this mechanism is not required to explain the absence of inhomogenous distributions : these macrostates are sufficiently unlikely to occur to be safely neglected .",
    "quite similarly , as we will argue below , despite decoherence being a powerful mechanism to explain the disappearance of macroscopic quantum superpositions @xcite , these states are a priori extremely rare in many ensembles of pure states .",
    "while mixed states already include the effect of decoherence and feature little macroscopicity @xcite , we focus here on pure states .",
    "the typicality of macroscopic entanglement then depends on the actual choice of the pure - state ensemble .",
    "we find analytical and numerical evidence that macroscopic superpositions are untypical among random pure states in different ensembles .",
    "this finding may appear paradoxical at first sight , since macroscopicity leads to multipartite entanglement @xcite and entanglement , as quantified by the geometric measure @xcite ( tantamount to a large distance to separable states ) , is common in random pure states @xcite .",
    "we resolve this ostensible paradox by showing that geometric entanglement is actually adverse for macroscopicity : random states are very entangled , and _ hence _ non - macroscopic .",
    "we review measures of macroscopic and geometric entanglement in section [ quantification ] , where we also present some technical results .",
    "since both quantities are defined via a maximization procedure , their relationship is intricate .",
    "we elucidate their connection qualitatively in section [ relationship ] , in order to gain a good understanding of the statistics of macroscopic entanglement evaluated in different pure - state ensembles in section [ statistics ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] , where we propose an extension of our study to other ensembles and sketch its consequences for the preparation of macroscopic states in the experiment .",
    "in order to address our central question  is macroscopicity typical in ensembles of pure quantum states ?  we need to establish a quantitative measure for macroscopicity .",
    "our system of interest is a collection of @xmath0 qubits , which , for the purpose of illustration , we treat as spin 1/2-particles .",
