    "<S> we summarize a new analysis of the distribution @xmath0 of charged leptons produced in decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons in the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) formalism for transverse momentum resummation . by comparing the @xmath0 distribution measured at the tevatron with the resummed css cross section with approximate @xmath3 wilson coefficients , </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the magnitude of the nonperturbative gaussian smearing factor and analyze its uncertainty caused by variations in scale parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find excellent agreement between the @xmath0 data and our theoretical prediction , provided by the resbos resummation program . </S>",
    "<S> the nonperturbative factor that we obtained can be used to update resummed qcd predictions for precision measurements in inclusive @xmath4 and @xmath1 production and for comparisons to various models of nonperturbative dynamics .    * leptonic angular distribution @xmath5 as a probe of nonperturbative dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> * precision of the current data from the tevatron and lhc on the inclusive transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath1 bosons imposes growing demands on theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 distributions are used for lucent tests of qcd factorization and in measurements of the @xmath4 boson mass that place important constraints on the parameters of electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of radiative contributions affect the @xmath6 distribution of a heavy boson at the current level of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> they include nnlo qcd and nlo ew perturbative corrections , logarithmic qcd contibutions that dominate @xmath7 when @xmath8 , and also nonperturbative power - suppressed terms that modify the @xmath6 distribution when @xmath6 is below a few gev . </S>",
    "<S> collins , soper , and sterman ( css ) [ ] have developed a qcd factorization approach to include all such terms order by order in @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the css formalism combines the resummation of large sudakov factors in the small-@xmath6 limit [ ] with fixed - order qcd contributions at large @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> as a recent development , the nnll / nnlo expression for the resummed @xmath6 distribution has been published [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the css method is a classical realization of the factorization based on transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution functions , in which pdfs and fragmentation functions depend explicitly on intrinsic transverse momentum in addition to the usual momentum fraction variables . </S>",
    "<S> while theoretical methods of tmd factorization [ ] and soft - collinear effective theory [ ] undergo rapid developments , the css formalism is well - suited for detailed phenomenological studies , as it is implemented in detail in practical simulations . in this short paper , we summarize a recent application of the css formalism for the computation of the angular distribution @xmath10 of the lepton pairs in @xmath11 boson production at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> full details will be presented in a separate forthcoming paper [ ] . the @xmath5 distribution is closely related to the @xmath6 distribution in the limit @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> its analysis may provide valuable insights about the nonperturbative qcd dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the d collaboration has published detailed measurements of the @xmath5 dependence in the electron and muon decay channels [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we ask if the d data corroborate the universal behavior of the resummed nonperturbative terms that was observed in the global analyses of @xmath6 distributions in @xmath13 and @xmath1 production at fixed - target and collider energies [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the rapidity dependence of the nonperturbative terms , which may be indicative of new types of higher - order contributions [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the small-@xmath6 part of the distribution is obtained in the css formalism by the fourier - bessel transform of a form factor @xmath14 that depends on the transverse position variable @xmath15 . for large boson virtualities @xmath16 of order 100 gev , the overall form of the @xmath6 distribution _ at all @xmath6 _ </S>",
    "<S> is determined by small-@xmath15 contributions , arising at energy scales @xmath17 gev . </S>",
    "<S> such contributions are entirely predicted in perturbative qcd theory . </S>",
    "<S> they dominate the cross section at any @xmath6 value [ ] . when @xmath6 is below 5 gev , the production rate is also mildly sensitive to the behavior of @xmath14 at @xmath18 gev@xmath19 , where the perturbative expansion is increasingly unreliable because of the vicinity of the landau pole in @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested to know which forms of the large-@xmath15 extrapolation of @xmath14 are compatible with the observed behavior of @xmath6 and @xmath5 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> a comprehensive solution for @xmath14 at large @xmath15 remains elusive , but efforts to derive it produced several instructive models , such as [ ] . from the phenomenological point of view , a typical @xmath1 data set does not have sensitivity to distinguish between these models . in deeply nonperturbative region that is characterized by </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 1 gev@xmath19 , the form factor @xmath14 is strongly suppressed and does not contribute to @xmath7 for @xmath16 of order @xmath22 [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> only the contributions from the transition region of @xmath15 of about @xmath23 gev@xmath19 , where @xmath24 is about 1 gev , are numerically non - negligible compared to the leading - power cross section predicted by perturbative qcd theory . in the transition region , the extrapolation of the perturbative expression provides a reasonable approximation for the leading - power ( logarithmic ) part of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be realized in the `` revised @xmath25 model '' [ ] , which parametrizes the extrapolated contribution by a flexible form that depends on a single parameter @xmath26 . in addition , a few suppressed terms proportional to even powers of @xmath15 play some role in this interval of @xmath15 . in comparisons to the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , their cumulative effect can be usually approximated by a single gaussian smearing factor @xmath27 , where the coefficient @xmath28 is found from the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this arrangement provides a few - parameter approximation for viable nonperturbative models in the phenomenologically relevant region of @xmath15 . in our previous work [ ] , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and @xmath16-dependence of the gaussian factor were determined from @xmath6 distributions of the drell - yan pairs . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the @xmath5 distribution has been proposed as a sensitive probe of the small-@xmath6 dynamics [ ] , as it has reduced uncertainties associated with the lepton momentum resolution . here </S>",
    "<S> we update the constraints on the gaussian smearing factor in @xmath1 boson production using the @xmath29 distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is carried out using the program resbos [ ] , which realizes the css formalism to compute fully differential cross sections of lepton pairs in production of high - mass virtual photons ( @xmath13 ) and heavy electroweak bosons ( @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a resummed treatment of new variables @xmath31 and @xmath5 and their relationship to @xmath6 was studied in [ ] . the fully differential output from resbos can also be cast in the form of the @xmath5 distribution . in the new analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find an excellent agreement between the resbos prediction and the @xmath5 data , contrary to the conclusion made by the d paper [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the quality of agreement depends on the inclusion of perturbative loop contributions and selection of scales in the resummed cross section . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] , the evidence for a nonzero nonperturbative factor in @xmath1 production has been contested in the light of the uncertainty in the resummed cross section due to the dependence on factorization scales . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence for nonperturbative smearing is inconclusive at the nll+nlo level because of a large scale dependence . to address this point </S>",
    "<S> , we fully include the scale dependence in the small-@xmath6 part of the resummed cross section up to @xmath32 [ ] . despite the scale uncertainties , the statistical analysis of the fit to the @xmath5 data indicates pronounced preference for a nonperturbative gaussian contribution with @xmath33 gev@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason is that the gaussian suppression of the large-@xmath15 tail of @xmath14 alters the resummed @xmath7 in a different way than the factorization scales in the leading - power part of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonperturbative gaussian factor suppresses the rate only at @xmath6 below 2 - 3 gev , while the leading - power scale dependence affects a broader interval of @xmath6 values . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a characteristic shift of the peak in the @xmath7 distribution due to the nonperturbative suppression , which is distinct from the typical scale dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> * particulars of the calculation . * in the css formalism , the full resummed ( res ) @xmath6 distribution is commonly represented as a combination of the resummed ( w ) , finite - order ( fo ) , and asymptotic ( asy ) terms [ ] : @xmath35 the accuracy of the d measurement demands that the main perturbative corrections due to the qcd and electroweak radiation are included . </S>",
    "<S> numerical , but not analytical , results for the complete nnlo qcd contribution to the resummed @xmath6 distribution in @xmath11 production at the tevatron have been recently released [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> resbos includes the dominant nnlo qcd contributions and provides a faithful estimate for the remaining small nnlo contribution that has not been published in an analytical form , as summarized below . </S>",
    "<S> thus , effectively resbos is close to the full nnlo precision in the kinematical region relevant for this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak ( ew ) corrections to @xmath1 production compete in magnitude with nnlo qcd contributions and are available to nlo [ ] . in the comparison to the d data , we do not include the ew corrections in our theory prediction , but correct the fitted @xmath5 data by subtracting the predominant correction due to the final - state photon radiation obtained by the photos code [ ] . upon the inclusion of these contributions , </S>",

    "<S> they arise because @xmath37 depends on two distinct momentum scales @xmath51 and @xmath16 . specifically , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the scale introduced by the evolution equations that control the large logarithms . </S>",
