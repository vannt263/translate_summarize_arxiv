    "despite recent advances in the study of qcd at small but non - zero density on the lattice @xcite the sign problem still persists in the study of dense , low temperature , _ exotic _ matter phases .",
    "one approach is to study four - fermi theories which , unlike @xmath4 qcd ( in which the @xmath5 baryons are bosonic ) , can display fermi - surface effects such as bcs superfluidity .",
    "although these models exhibit no confinement , one variant , the @xmath6 njl model , possesses the same global symmetries as 2 flavour qcd , which should allow us to investigate the phase structure of this theory .",
    "the model studied here , which uses staggered lattice fermions , is the 3 + 1 dimensional version of that studied in @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular the model has the action @xmath7 where the bispinor @xmath8 is written in terms of independent isospinor fermionic fields via @xmath9 , and the auxiliary bosonic fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 are introduced in the standard way . written in the gorkov basis",
    "the fermion matrix is @xmath12 where the matrix @xmath13 is identical to the @xmath0d form of that given in @xcite .",
    "the diquark sources @xmath3 and @xmath14 differ from those in @xcite by a factor of 2 which allows us to identify them with majorana masses .",
    "being a theory of point - like interactions the njl model has no continuum limit for @xmath15 leaving the physics sensitive to simulation parameters . in order to ensure we simulate in a physical regime these parameters",
    "are fitted to physical observables calculated in the large @xmath2 limit at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in particular we evaluate dimensionless ratios between the pion decay rate @xmath17 , the constituent quark mass @xmath18 and the pion mass @xmath19 , and fit to the phenomenological values of 93mev , 350mev and 138mev respectively . using these fits",
    "we determine the bare quark mass @xmath20 and the inverse coupling @xmath21 .",
    "we also extract the large @xmath2 lattice spacing @xmath22mev , which allows us to present results in physical units .",
    "the above model was simulated with a hybrid monte carlo algorithm on @xmath23 lattices with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a partially quenched approximation was used in which the diquark sources are set to zero during the update of the auxiliary fields but are non - zero during the measurement of diquark observables .    in order to study chiral symmetry breaking we measure the chiral condensate @xmath27 and baryon number density @xmath28 , which are defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30     and baryon number density @xmath28 as functions of @xmath1 with lattice results compared to the large @xmath2 limit.,width=283 ]    plots of @xmath27 and @xmath28 as functions of chemical potential are presented in figure [ eofs ] .",
    "both the large @xmath2 solutions and the lattice data have been extrapolated to the limit @xmath31 .",
    "chiral symmetry is broken in the low @xmath1 phase , as signalled by an non - zero chiral condensate , and is approximately restored as @xmath1 is increased through what appears to be a crossover .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition in the njl model is strongly dependent on the parameters used @xcite .    in the diquark sector , the operators @xmath32 allow one to define the diquark condensate as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .     for high and low @xmath1 .",
    ", width=283 ]    figure [ qq ] shows the condensate plotted as a function of @xmath3 extrapolated to @xmath35 ( we simulate with @xmath36 throughout ) . for @xmath16 a quadratic fit through the data",
    "is consistent with the condensate vanishing as @xmath37 . for high @xmath1",
    "the fit is consistent with a non - zero diquark condensate which is similar in magnitude to the chiral condensate in the vacuum .",
    "we believe that finite volume effects cause the points with @xmath38 to fall below the curve .",
    "in particular , in the high @xmath1 phase as @xmath37 we expect an exact goldstone mode which leads the correlation length to diverge .",
    "for this reason these points have been ignored during the fits .",
    "finally , if we define susceptibilities @xmath39 we can clearly distinguish between the two phases by studying the ratio @xmath40 if a @xmath41 baryon number symmetry is manifest , the two susceptibilities should be identical up to a sign factor and the ratio should equal 1 . if the symmetry is broken , the ward identity @xmath42 predicts that @xmath43 should diverge and the ratio should vanish .     vs. @xmath3 for high and low @xmath1.,width=283 ]",
    "figure [ rat0 ] shows the susceptibility ratio as a function of @xmath3 , again extrapolated to @xmath35 .",
    "a linear fit through the @xmath16 data is consistent with a manifest @xmath44 symmetry .",
    "for @xmath45 we see markedly different behaviour , with a fit ( again discarding @xmath38 ) suggesting an intercept close to zero and therefore a broken baryon number symmetry .",
    "we have provided preliminary evidence of a bcs superfluid phase in the 3 + 1d njl model at high @xmath1 , with an order parameter approximately equal in magnitude to the chiral order parameter at @xmath16 .",
    "the behaviour of the susceptibility ratio defined in ( [ r ] ) further supports a broken @xmath44 symmetry in the high @xmath1 phase analogous to the broken @xmath46 in bcs superconductors .",
    "this study provides the first evidence of a bcs phase in lattice field theory , which we interpret as evidence of a colour - superconducting phase at high @xmath1 in qcd .",
    "clearly , more data are required for intermediate values of @xmath1 to understand the nature of the diquark transition . to have more control over the finite volume effects shown in figures [ qq ] and [ rat0 ]",
    "it may also be necessary to study lattices with @xmath47 .",
    "finally , in the future we wish to study the fermion dispersion relation",
    ". this will allow us to present a comparison between the chiral mass gap @xmath48 and the bcs superfluid gap @xmath49 which can , in principle , be experimentally determined .",
    "this project is being carried out in collaboration with simon hands ."
