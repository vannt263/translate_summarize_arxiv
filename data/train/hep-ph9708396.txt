    "quark - hadron duality , in its most general form , is the notion that certain rates for processes involving hadrons can be computed simply as the underlying partonic rates@xcite .",
    "duality allows us to compute many quantities which would otherwise be hopelessly difficult .",
    "one common application of duality is to the nonleptonic weak decays of heavy hadrons .",
    "the lore is that , for large enough heavy quark mass , duality holds in the computation of the hadronic width .",
    "several discrepancies between theory and experiment that have recently received attention rely on quark - hadron duality . among them are the significant difference between lifetimes of beauty baryons and mesons@xcite , the overestimates of the @xmath2-meson semileptonic branching fraction@xcite and the average number of charm quarks per @xmath2 decay@xcite . because the limit of experimental knowledge about nonleptonic @xmath2 decays is rapidly expanding , such issues are of great topical interest .",
    "but when is duality valid ? in many cases duality follows from the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the rate of @xmath3 and for the semileptonic decay rates of heavy hadrons .",
    "however , duality is applied in many other cases , such as in hadronic widths of heavy hadrons , for which there is no ope .",
    "reference  @xcite proposes an ope - like expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass  @xmath4 , which not only incorporates quark - hadron duality as the lowest term in the expansion , but also organizes the corrections by inverse powers of @xmath4 .",
    "a main result of that work is the claim that corrections first appear at order @xmath5 .",
    "the question above can be reformulated as , `` is an ope - like expansion like that of ref .",
    "@xcite valid ? ''    to investigate the validity of duality it is convenient to work with a soluble model of strong interactions formulated as a full - fledged field theory , so that one may test duality both in cases with and without an ope .",
    "the t  hooft model@xcite , large-@xmath6 qcd in @xmath7 dimensions , is a good laboratory for this purpose .",
    "it contains an infinite spectrum of mesons composed of confined quarks , realizes asymptotic freedom trivially , and inherits all the phenomenological consequences of large-@xmath6 qcd@xcite common to our universe , such as dominance of scattering amplitudes with the minimum number of meson states , ozi suppression , the absence of exotics , and others . for processes with an ope ,",
    "duality in the t hooft model has been checked explicitly@xcite . however",
    ", little is known about duality for non - ope processes .",
    "the reason is that , in precisely those cases for which an ope is lacking , there is no simple analytical method of verifying duality , and one must resort to arguments based on numerical solutions .    in this paper",
    "we compute the hadronic weak decay width @xmath8 of heavy `` @xmath2 '' mesons in the t  hooft model as a function of the heavy `` @xmath9 '' quark mass  @xmath4 ; the meaning of `` heavy '' is made precise in sec .",
    "[ review ] .",
    "we compare this to the partonic ( perturbative ) decay width of the heavy quark , @xmath10 , which we compute analytically . for large @xmath4",
    "we find that both @xmath10 and @xmath8 are essentially linear in @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between the two appears to be asymptotically constant and small , indicating a small @xmath1 correction to the naive duality limit . as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "new hadronic decay channels become accessible , and at each of these thresholds there is a singular peak in @xmath8 . averaging @xmath8 over a region in @xmath4 that includes many resonances removes these peaks but does not change the leading dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "_ our conclusion is that duality holds to leading order in @xmath4 , but unlike the ope - like expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite , appears to have @xmath1 corrections . _    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that there is strong experimental evidence for the failure of duality .",
    "what is meant there is that the pattern of corrections in powers of @xmath1 of ref .",
    "@xcite is not supported by experiment .",
    "this agrees with our result , which indicates a violation to duality at first order in the @xmath1 expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while we can not carry over our quantitative results to the physical world of non - planar qcd in @xmath11 dimensions , we believe that there is nothing intrinsic to 1 + 1 dimensions that would make duality work differently than in 3 + 1 . the operator analysis that leads to the @xmath1 expansion proceeds in 1 + 1 much as in 3 + 1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review ] , we briefly review the t  hooft model and a standard method for its numerical solution .",
    "section  [ 1 + 1 ] compares features of 1 + 1 dimensions , such as the nature of phase space and spin , to those in 3 + 1 dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ inc ] , we present the algebraic results of the inclusive parton - level calculation of widths . in sec .",
    "[ exc ] , we present the results of the exclusive calculation in the t  hooft model .",
    "section  [ res ] gives our numerical results and a discussion of their implications , and sec .",
    "[ conc ] concludes .",
    "there are other nonperturbative questions of phenomenological interest in the area of hadronic @xmath2 weak decays for which there is an established lore .",
    "one can test any of these hypotheses in the t  hooft model .",
    "of particular interest is the notion that contributions to decay amplitudes from different underlying quark diagram topologies contribute with distinct weights , which can very much suppress the amplitude from a given topology .",
    "for example , the `` annihilation '' diagrams , in which the valence quark - antiquark pair annihilate through a weak current , are supposedly suppressed relative the `` spectator '' diagrams by a factor of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the @xmath2 decay constant and @xmath14 its mass .",
    "we will address this question in a separate publication@xcite .",
    "the success of t  hooft s method of solving a strongly - coupled theory rests on two assumptions that considerably simplify the problem .",
    "first , one works in the limit of large @xmath6 , in which it is readily seen@xcite that diagrams including either internal fermion - antifermion loops or the crossing of gluon lines at points other than their vertices are suppressed by combinatorial powers of @xmath6 compared to those that do not .",
    "these simple topological consequences of the theory lead directly to the predictive power of large @xmath6 .",
    "second , in 1 + 1 dimensions one may use the gauge freedom of qcd to choose a linear gauge in which some chosen component of the gluon field vanishes , and only the sole orthogonal component survives .",
    "then , since the gluon self - coupling term in the field strength appears as a commutator of field components , this term vanishes in the gauge we have selected .",
    "consequently , gluon self - coupling vanishes in this gauge , and so in combination with large @xmath6 , gluon lines are not permitted to cross each other , even at vertices .",
    "moreover , ghosts are absent in linear gauges .",
    "it follows that the only diagrams that must be summed are `` rainbow '' diagrams for the quark mass and wave function renormalization , and `` ladder '' diagrams for quark - antiquark interactions@xcite .    in 1 + 1 dimensions confinement",
    "is realized trivially , since the lowest - order inter - quark potential obtained by taking the fourier transform of the gluon propagator ( which gives rise to the @xmath15 coulomb interaction in four dimensions ) grows linearly with the inter - quark separation .",
    "although lowest - order color confinement is an automatic consequence in two dimensions , it is a highly nontrivial fact that the phenomenon persists in the all - orders green function solutions of the t  hooft model .    to be specific , the lagrangian of qcd , as in four dimensions , is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 gauge field with field strength @xmath19 defined in the usual way , and @xmath20 is a dirac fermion of bare mass @xmath21 and flavor @xmath22 .",
    "the bare coupling @xmath23 not only has dimensions of mass in two dimensions , but scales as @xmath24 in the large-@xmath6 limit .",
    "the renormalization of the fermion propagator is exceptionally simple .",
    "the only modification is a shift of the bare fermion mass by @xmath25 consequently , it makes good sense to describe masses in units of @xmath26 , which is finite in the @xmath27 limit .",
    "the dividing line of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) in these units acts as a boundary between heavy and light quarks , as is numerically verified in refs .",
    "@xcite ; for example , in @xcite it was seen that the meson decay constant approaches the standard asymptotic behavior @xmath30 for @xmath31 or so .",
    "it follows that @xmath32 in 1 + 1 assumes a role analogous to @xmath33 in 3 + 1 .",
    "quantization of the theory is most convenient in axial light - cone gauge ( @xmath34 ) , where light cone coordinates are defined by @xmath35 and analogously for other vectors .",
    "the chief advantage of this choice is that only one component of the dirac algebra ( @xmath36 ) survives , thus effectively eliminating the need to perform dirac traces .    upon solving for the green function of a fermion - antifermion pair with bare masses @xmath4 and @xmath37 in this model , one obtains the bound - state eigenvalue equation @xmath38 which is known as the t  hooft equation@xcite . here the @xmath39th eigenstate @xmath40 is the meson wave function , the @xmath39th eigenvalue @xmath41 is its squared mass , and @xmath42 is the fraction of the meson momentum s minus component ( which acts , in the light - cone quantization , as a canonical spatial momentum component ) carried by quark @xmath4 .",
    "we will always label the ground state ( the lowest mass meson ) by @xmath43 .",
    "the principal value prescription serves to regulate the integrand singularity , which originates in the infrared divergence of the gluon propagator .",
    "this equation has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues that increase approximately linearly for large @xmath39 , and the wave functions vanish at the boundaries @xmath44 and 1 , with the asymptotic behavior @xmath45 as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and similarly as @xmath48 , exchanging @xmath37 for @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath49 is a monotonic function of @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) , increasing from zero to one as @xmath52 .",
    "also useful in this description is the full meson - quark vertex @xmath53 , which is given by @xmath54 for all complex values of @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , except for @xmath56 [ 0,1 ] , the principal value prescription is unnecessary .",
    "the decay constant @xmath57 for meson @xmath39 may be computed in this framework .",
    "it is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 strictly speaking , the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ dec ] ) is also multiplied by a factor @xmath60 , but we may absorb this factor into the normalization of other factors by which it is multiplied in the full amplitudes ; what is important is that the final physical amplitude has the correct @xmath6 dependence at leading order . as each new quantity",
    "is calculated in this paper , we will point out the leading dependence on @xmath6 , but as a rule we suppress the explicit factors for ease of notation .",
    "the t  hooft eigenfunctions @xmath61 , for example , are @xmath62 solutions of eq .",
    "( [ the ] ) , and so @xmath63 is also @xmath62 . on the other hand , light meson decay constants have the well - known behavior @xmath64 , and the full result eq .",
    "( [ dec ] ) , including the @xmath65 , may be verified by direct calculation .",
    "the t  hooft model wave functions @xmath61 and @xmath66 are calculated by means of a standard numerical method called the multhopp technique@xcite , in which the integral equation is converted to an equivalent infinite - dimensional eigenvalue system , which in turn may be truncated after a desired number of modes to give approximate wave function solutions .",
    "since the relevant formul for unequal - mass mesons do not appear elsewhere , we present a summary in appendix a.    whereas the eigenfunctions @xmath40 describe the complete set of homogeneous solutions for the two - point green function , the solution for @xmath67 meson decays ( the leading decay channels in large @xmath6 ) requires also three - point green functions . remarkably , the requisite expressions may be written entirely in terms of triple overlap integrals of the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69@xcite , without bare quark model contact - type interactions . in physical terms , this means that the three vertices of the diagram for the three - point green function are resonance dominated , without contact contributions . nevertheless , for the diagrams computed , it will prove to be computationally convenient to describe part of the full amplitude in terms of these contact terms .",
    "we exhibit these explicit expressions in sec .",
    "[ exc ] , but for the moment it is only important to note that such expressions indeed exist .",
    "despite one s hopes that exact calculations in the t  hooft model may lend insight into real 3 + 1 strong interaction physics , we emphasize that the two - dimensional universe possesses some unique properties that must be remembered when comparing to the universe of four dimensions .",
    "therefore , the t  hooft model may in no way be construed as any sort of limiting case of real qcd , and any direct comparisons are necessarily qualitative . in other words ,",
    "we espouse the opinion that only certain conclusions based upon our numerical studies of t  hooft model solutions , not the numerical results themselves , possess any validity in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the most obvious signal that 1 + 1 and 3 + 1 physics are vastly different is that the former does not possess the quantity of angular momentum , except in the residual form of parity matrix still exists in 1 + 1 , signaling two inequivalent representations of the lorentz group . ] .",
    "this is clear since finite rotations do not exist when there is only one spatial direction , and only the improper `` rotation '' taking @xmath70 , namely parity , remains .",
    "it follows that t  hooft model eigenstates @xmath71 do not possess spin , but only intrinsic parity @xmath72@xcite .",
    "all of the interesting phenomenology provided by approximate spin symmetries in our world ( _ i.e. _ , the smallness of hyperfine splittings , relations between different helicity amplitudes , _ etc .",
    "_ ) are therefore meaningless in two dimensions .",
    "the lack of transverse directions has important consequences for couplings in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , gauge couplings have dimensions of mass , and so such theories are super - renormalizable . moreover , `` vector '' gauge bosons exist in 1 + 1 only through their longitudinal modes .",
    "there are also different lorentz invariants in 1 + 1 , since the levi - civita tensor @xmath73 has only two indices .",
    "the effects of these constraints are implicit in all the results to follow .",
    "the amount of lorentz - invariant phase space is of course expected to vary between different spacetime dimensions @xmath74 , since the measure of the phase space integrals is the @xmath74-dimensional volume element .",
    "however , the difference between 1 + 1 and 3 + 1 is particularly dramatic . to be specific , in @xmath74 spacetime dimensions",
    ", the differential width for a @xmath67 decay in terms of the solid angle of either final - state particle is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the spatial momentum of either final - state particle in the rest frame of the initial particle of mass @xmath4 , and @xmath77 is the invariant amplitude of the process .",
    "note particularly the behavior of the phase space factor @xmath78 as the @xmath79 threshold is approached : for @xmath80 , the differential width vanishes with the decreasing amount of phase space available , but for @xmath81 , the differential width actually becomes singular ( barring an accidental zero in the amplitude @xmath77 ) .",
    "it follows that two - particle decay modes near threshold are enhanced in 1 + 1 , in stark contrast to 3 + 1 .",
    "because of the small number of integrations necessary to compute phase space in 1 + 1 dimensions , it is possible to perform the partonic integrals analytically in all cases of interest to us . in the @xmath82 parton decay ,",
    "one starts with @xmath83 final - state momentum components , of which 2 are fixed by energy - momentum conservation and 3 are fixed by the on - shell conditions of the final - state partons ; this leaves only one nontrivial integration , which can be done explicitly . for lorentz scalars and @xmath84 for pseudoscalars . ]    here we consider the case of an initial quark of mass @xmath4 decaying into three distinguishable equal - mass quarks of mass @xmath85 .",
    "the final nontrivial integral involves a small number of square root factors arising from the on - shell mass - energy constraints , since both energies and momenta appear in both the phase space and the invariant amplitude expressed in a given frame .",
    "such expressions in our case integrate to the standard three kinds of complete elliptic integrals of legendre , usually denoted by @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "we begin by presenting the functional form for the phase space with constant invariant amplitude : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , \\ ] ] and @xmath91 note that , unlike the two - body phase space given by eq .",

    "we now present the expressions for the inclusive partonic decay width .",
    "for definiteness , we attempt to describe the couplings in terms as similar to standard model ( sm ) notation as possible .",
    "our labeling of partons is exhibited in fig .  1 .",
    "the decay of the heavy quark 1 to the lighter quark 3 is assumed to couple to a vector - like weak current with vertex factor @xmath97 , carried by a gauge boson `` @xmath98 '' of mass @xmath99 ; in the sm , @xmath100 .",
    "the coupling at the other end of the weak current , creating quark 5 and antiquark 4 , is assumed to be the same except for the `` ckm element '' @xmath101 .",

    "( [ eps ] ) and ( [ u ] ) .",
    "the weak decay amplitude and width in this case are effects of orders @xmath60 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this counting may be established in the parton diagram by observing that the pair ( @xmath106 ) in fig .",
    "1 can occur with each of the @xmath6 colors , but `` sewing up '' the partons into color - singlet mesons ( @xmath107 ) , ( @xmath108 ) , and ( @xmath109 ) costs a factor of @xmath24 each .",
    "finally , each color may occur in the loop created by 1 , 3 , and 2 , for one more factor of @xmath6 .",

    "the width is presented in two special cases . in the first , we take @xmath114 , the usual four - fermion coupling assumption .",

    "the former limit shows that the width for the partonic decay of the heavy quark is given approximately by @xmath4 times a constant , dimensionless coefficient .",
    "it is easy to understand the prefactor @xmath120 , which means that the width in the @xmath114 limit vanishes for @xmath121 currents .",

    "in fact , the amplitudes we have computed all obey these constraints .",
    "we see that the linear behavior observed requires a delicate balance of numbers and mass dependences of amplitudes versus excitation numbers , and we hope to obtain analytic arguments for this remarkable behavior in the future .",
    "what are we to conclude from this result ?",
    "the t hooft model is exactly soluble , so it must be the case that the fully - dressed parton diagrams give results agreeing with the hadronic calculation ; indeed , this is how the hadronic problem was solved in the first place .",
    "the partonic width computed in ( [ partw1 ] ) represents only the born term in an expansion in strong coupling @xmath23 , so the addition of gluon loops is apparently necessary to bring the two results into agreement .",
    "the small discrepancy between the curves may have this origin , or it may simply be a limitation of the numerical accuracy of the calculation . however , it is interesting to note that the two curves appear to differ asymptotically by a constant , which for plots linear in @xmath4 is a @xmath1 correction .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this effect is genuine and not a numerical artifact . in fig .  6",
    "we superimpose on the hadronic width of fig .",
    "4 the curve @xmath250 , and see that the fit is outstanding . from this result , we learn that local duality for this system is violated badly only for the first few resonances and very close to thresholds of higher resonances , and that @xmath1 effects appear to be only at the few percent level for @xmath251 . it would be very interesting to see explicitly what happens to the partonic inclusive width at the one- or two - loop level .",
    "6.0 truein one natural idea of how to improve the born result is to replace the bare quark masses with the renormalized values .",
    "this would not sum all gluon corrections , but it would include an important subclass of them . unfortunately ,",
    "due to the result ( [ mren ] ) , masses below 1.0 ( such as that of our light antiquark ) have _ imaginary _ renormalized values , and then our whole interpretation of phase space , essential for the calculation of the width , becomes ambiguous .",
    "we have calculated the nonleptonic decay width of a heavy - light meson in the context of the t  hooft model as a function of the bare heavy quark mass , both for the born term of the free partonic decay ( which we called the `` partonic width '' ) and the full sum of allowed hadronic decays ( the `` hadronic width '' ) .",
    "we found that these two quantities approximately agree at leading order in @xmath4 , with the hadronic width being slightly larger .",
    "both quantities are observed to grow linearly and smoothly for large @xmath4 , despite the effects of numerous phase space threshold singularities in the hadronic case .",
    "the slight discrepancy between hadronic and partonic widths is well - fit by a @xmath1 correction , @xmath252 .",
    "assuming that the small discrepancy between the partonic and hadronic results is genuine ( rather than a numerical artifact ) leads one to conclude that nonleptonic heavy - light meson decays in 1 + 1 dimensions can not be described in terms of an ope that lacks @xmath1 corrections , and it naturally leads one to believe that the same conclusion is true in 3 + 1 . since the lowest order of the ope is simply the naive free quark picture , this result also has obvious implications for the application of quark models in such decays .",
    "another incisive test of quark - hadron duality in 1 + 1 is whether annihilation diagrams , in which the valence quarks in the decaying meson annihilate through a weak current , are suppressed compared to spectator tree diagrams ( fig .  2 ) ; these studies are well underway@xcite , and results will be forthcoming shortly .    a number of unanswered questions not addressed by this work include the effects of loop corrections to the born amplitude free quark decay , the dependence of decay widths on the light quark mass , the effects of including finite meson strong decay widths ( which are @xmath253 ) , the effects of identical final state quarks or mesons , multiparticle final states ( also suppressed by powers of @xmath6 ) , and so on . while `` two - dimensional phenomenology '' can not be used as a quantitative substitute for the standard four - dimensional variety , it clearly indicates the limitations of the standard lore .",
    "_ note added_. an interesting recent work by blok@xcite suggests that global quark - hadron duality at high energies in the t  hooft model with massless quarks may be achieved by including smearing through the @xmath254-suppressed widths of resonances . our calculation , on the other hand , does not include finite - width effects but nevertheless achieves an effectively smeared result , even at relatively low @xmath4 , which supports the claim of duality at leading order .",
