    "in the last few years the developments in modern communication systems produced many results in a short amount of time .",
    "especially quantum communication systems allow us to exploit new possibilities while at the same time imposing fundamental limitations .",
    "quantum mechanics differs significantly from classical mechanics , it has its own laws .",
    "quantum information theory unifies information theory with quantum mechanic , generalizing classical information theory to the quantum world .",
    "the unit of quantum information is called the `` qubit '' , the quantum analogue of the classical `` bit '' . unlike a bit , which is either `` 0 '' or `` 1 ''",
    ", a qubit can be in `` superposition '' , i.e. both states at the same time , this is a fundamental tool in quantum information and computing .",
    "a quantum channel is a communication channel which can transmit quantum information . in general , there are two ways to represent a quantum channel with linear algebraic tools , either as a sum of several transformations , or as a single unitary transformation which explicitly includes the unobserved environment",
    ".    quantum channels can transmit both classical and quantum information .",
    "we consider the capacity of quantum channels carrying classical information .",
    "this is equivalent to considering the capacity of classical - quantum channels , where the classical - quantum channels are quantum channels whose sender s inputs are classical variables .",
    "the classical capacity of quantum channels has been determined in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our goal is to investigate in communication that takes place over a quantum channel which is , in addition to the noise from the environment , subjected to the action of a jammer which actively manipulates the states .",
    "the messages ought also to be kept secret from an eavesdropper .    a classical - quantum channel with a jammer is called an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channel , where the jammer may change his input in every channel use and is not restricted to use a repetitive probabilistic strategy . in the model of an arbitrarily varying channel",
    ", we consider a channel which is not stationary and can change with every use .",
    "we interpret this as an attack of a jammer .",
    "it works as follows : the sender and the receiver have to select their coding scheme first .",
    "after that the jammer makes his choice of the channel state to sabotage the message transmission .",
    "however , due to the physical properties , we assume that the jammer s changes only take place in a known set .    the arbitrarily varying channel was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed a surprising result which is known as the ahlswede dichotomy : either the capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel is zero or it equals its shared randomness assisted capacity .",
    "after the discovery in @xcite it remained as an open question when the deterministic capacity is positive . in @xcite a sufficient condition for that has been given , and in @xcite it is proved that this condition is also necessary . the ahlswede dichotomy demonstrates the importance of shared randomness for communication in a very clear form .    in @xcite the capacity of arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channels",
    "is analyzed .",
    "a lower bound of the capacity has been given .",
    "an alternative proof of @xcite s result and a proof of the strong converse are given in @xcite . in @xcite the ahlswede dichotomy for the arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channels is established , and a sufficient and necessary condition for the zero deterministic capacity is given . in @xcite a simplification of this condition for the arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channels is given .    in the model of a wiretap channel",
    "we consider secure communication .",
    "this was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "we interpret the wiretap channel as a channel with an eavesdropper .",
    "for a discussion of the relation of the different security criteria we refer to @xcite and @xcite .    a classical - quantum channel with an eavesdropper is called a classical - quantum wiretap channel , its secrecy capacity has been determined in @xcite and @xcite .    this work is a progress of our previous papers @xcite and @xcite , where we considered channel robustness against jamming and at the same time security against eavesdropping . a classical - quantum channel with a jammer and at the same time an eavesdropper",
    "is called an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel .",
    "it is defined as a family of pairs of indexed channels @xmath0 with a common input alphabet and possible different output systems , connecting a sender with two receivers , a legal one and a wiretapper , where @xmath1 is called a channel state of the channel pair .",
    "the legitimate receiver accesses the output of the first part of the pair , i.e. , the first channel @xmath2 in the pair , and the wiretapper observes the output of the second part , i.e. , the second channel @xmath3 .",
    "a channel state @xmath1 , which varies from symbol to symbol in an arbitrary manner , governs both the legal receiver s channel and the wiretap channel .",
    "a code for the channel conveys information to the legal receiver such that the wiretapper knows nothing about the transmitted information .",
    "in @xcite we established the ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels , i.e. , either the deterministic capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel is zero or equals its randomness assisted capacity .",
    "our proof is similar to the proof of the ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channels in @xcite : we build a two - part code word , the first part is used to create the common randomness for the sender and the legal receiver , the second is used to transmit the message to the legal receiver .",
    "we also analyzed the secrecy capacity when the sender and the receiver used various resources .",
    "in @xcite we determined the secrecy capacities under common randomness assisted coding of arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels .",
    "we also examined when the secrecy capacity was a continuous function of the system parameters .",
    "furthermore , we proved the phenomenon `` super - activation '' for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels , i.e. , there were two channels , both with zero deterministic secrecy capacity , such that if they were used together they allowed perfect secure transmission with positive deterministic secrecy capacity . combining the results of these two paper we get the formula for deterministic secrecy capacity of the arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel .",
    "as aforementioned the lower bound in @xcite and @xcite is shown by building a two - part deterministic code .",
    "however that code concept still leaves something to be desired because we had to reduce the generality of the code concept when we explicitly allowed a small part of the code word to be non - secure .",
    "the code word we built was a composition of a public code word to synchronize the second part and a common randomness assisted code word to transmit the message .",
    "we only required security for the last part . as we will show in corollary [ enrtitvwsc ] , when the jammer has access to the first part , it will be rendered completely useless .",
    "thus the code concept only works when the jammer is limited in his action , e.g. we have to assume that eavesdropper can not send messages towards the jammer .",
    "nevertheless this code concept with weak criterion can be useful when small amount of public messages is desired , e.g. when the receiver uses it to estimate the channels . in this work we consider the general code concept when we construct a code in such a way that every part of it is secure .",
    "we show that when the legal channel is not symmetrizabel the sender can send a small amount of secure transmissions which push the secure capacity to the maximally attainable value .",
    "thus the entire security is granted .",
    "we call it the strong code concept .",
    "this completes our analysis of arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel .    in @xcite we analyzed the secrecy capacities of various coding schemes with resource assistance .",
    "we showed that when the jammer was not allowed to has access to the resource , it was very helpful for the secure message transmission through an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel . in this work",
    "we analyze the case when the shared randomness is not secure against the jammer .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the secrecy capacity was in general not a continuous function of the system parameters .",
    "in @xcite we proved super - activation for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels . in this work",
    "we establish complete characterizations for continuity and positivity of the capacity function of arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels , and a complete characterization for super - activation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    the main definitions are given in section [ bdacs2 ] .",
    "in section [ cavqw ] we determine a secrecy capacity formula for a mixed channel model which is called the classic arbitrarily varying quantum wiretap channel . this formula is used for our result in section [ tsmwscr ] .    in section [ tsmwscr ]",
    "our main result is presented . in this section",
    "we determine the secrecy capacity for the arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channels under strong code concept .",
    "in section [ cwrioppc ] we analyze when the sender and the legal receiver had the possibility to use shared randomness which is not secure against the jammer .",
    "we also determine the secrecy capacity of arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels shared randomness which is secure against eavesdropping .    as an application of the results of our earlier works , in section [ someapp ] we establish when the secrecy capacity of an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel is positive and when it is a continuous quantity of the system parameters .",
    "furthermore we show when `` super - activation '' occurs for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels .",
