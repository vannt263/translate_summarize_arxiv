    "the interaction of a bound electron and an atomic nucleus is characterized by the parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the nuclear charge number and @xmath6 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "this universal `` coupling parameter '' sets the scale for calculations of the radiative corrections to various bound - state effects including the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) and the bound - electron @xmath0 factor .",
    "traditionally , theoretical investigations of radiative corrections in light systems relied upon an expansion in powers of @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ". however , today it is desirable to advance theory beyond the predictive limits given by the highest available terms in the @xmath7-expansion .",
    "this can be done by carrying out calculations with using nonperturbative ( in @xmath7 ) propagators .",
    "such calculations demand rather sophisticated numerical techniques , which were developed relatively recently .",
    "indeed , all - order calculations of the self - energy ( se ) correction in the presence of a magnetic field started in the 1990s @xcite , extending during past years to a wide range of reference states and nuclear charge numbers @xcite .    numerical calculations of the se corrections are particularly difficult for low values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is mainly for two reasons .",
    "first , the goal of the calculations is the contribution beyond the known @xmath4-expansion terms . for the hfs ,",
    "the higher - order effects are suppressed with respect to the leading correction by a factor of @xmath9 . for the @xmath0 factor",
    ", they enter only at order of @xmath10 and thus become very small numerically in the low-@xmath5 region .",
    "second , in actual calculations there are additional cancellations arising at intermediate stages of the numerical procedure .",
    "these cancellations become more severe for smaller values of @xmath5 and lead to further losses of accuracy .    in this article , we treat the two most important example cases of the bound - electon se corrections in external magnetic fields : the se correction to the hfs and the se correction to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor .",
    "we evaluate both of these corrections for the ground and excited states of hydrogen and of light hydrogen - like ions .",
    "the first attempt at an all - order evaluation of the se correction to the hfs of hydrogen was made in ref .",
    "because of insufficient numerical accuracy , the goal was reached in an indirect way : the known terms of the @xmath4 expansion were subtracted from numerically determined all - order results for @xmath11 , and the higher - order remainder was extrapolated down toward the desired value @xmath12 .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the se correction to the hfs was improved by several orders of magnitude during the past years @xcite .",
    "however , the precision obtained was still insufficient for a direct determination of the higher - order se remainder at @xmath12 , and an extrapolation procedure had to be employed again .",
    "the studies @xcite reported results for the higher - order contribution for the normalized difference of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 hfs intervals in @xmath15 and demonstrated a @xmath16 deviation of the theoretical prediction from the experimental result @xcite .",

    "an opinion was expressed in ref .",

    "good agreement was observed with the previous extrapolated values @xcite , but the accuracy was increased by several orders of magnitude . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the details of this calculation and extend it to the higher excited states ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the se correction to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor is of particular importance because it is used in the determination of the electron mass value from the experimental results for the @xmath0 factor of light hydrogen - like ions @xcite .",
    "already at the present level of experimental accuracy , calculations of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor should be performed to all orders in @xmath4 .",
    "a number of all - order evaluations of the se correction to the @xmath0 factor have been accomplished during last years @xcite , which resulted in an improvement of the precision of the electron mass value . however , in order to match the @xmath20 level of accuracy anticipated in future experiments on the helium ion @xcite , the precision of numerical calculations of the se correction should be enhanced by several orders of magnitude .",
