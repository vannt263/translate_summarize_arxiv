    "with the rapid miniaturization of electronic devices comes the need to understand their operation at an unprecedented level .",
    "quantum mechanical effects are becoming increasingly important in the design of nanometre - scale transistors @xcite , posing new challenges in the experimental characterization and corresponding theoretical description of the devices that will constitute the next generations of commercial electronics .",
    "quantum effects in the electron transport of nanodevices have already been the subject of many years of fundamental research .",
    "single - electron devices @xcite are the focus of much of this research , possessing highly non - linear current - voltage characteristics resulting from a combination of quantum mechanical ( charge quantization , discrete energy levels ) and classical effects ( coulomb repulsion ) .",
    "these properties have lead to single - electron devices being used as ultra - sensitive charge sensors @xcite and amplifiers for quantum signals @xcite . here",
    "the term `` single - electron device '' refers to the fact that the current consists of individual electrons , sequentially flowing through a nanostructure .    upon",
    "further miniaturization , one reaches the fully quantum - mechanical regime of few - electron quantum dots @xcite or single - donor devices @xcite .",
    "both types of quantum wells are characterized by an electron confinement strong enough to create single - particle energy levels with a spacing larger than the thermal broadening .",
    "this allows individual resolution of the energy levels of the quantum dot , whether from electrostatically defined dots or arising from a donor potential . in this work",
    "we will refer to both types of devices as ` ( quantum ) dots ' , unless specifically mentioned otherwise .",
    "few - electron quantum dots are the subject of intense investigation in the context of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "individual charge carriers confined in quantum dot structures can be used to encode quantum information using either the charge @xcite or the spin @xcite degree of freedom . for this purpose",
    "it is essential that the electrons occupy well - defined energy states , and the details of the excitation spectrum are vital in determining , for instance , the coherence and relaxation times of the qubit @xcite .",
    "the most common experimental method to investigate the energy level structure of a dot is bias spectroscopy @xcite . for a dot coupled to source and drain reservoirs ,",
    "resonant tunnelling occurs when occupied electronic states in the source and/or drain align with available states in the dot , as sketched in figure [ fig : simple_tunnel](a ) .",
    "this allows electrons to flow sequentially through the dot and to be detected as a change in source - drain current .",
    "voltages on nearby gates are used to control the electrochemical potential of the dot .",
    "a bias spectroscopy experiment is a measurement of the source - drain conductance as a function of source - drain bias and gate voltages .",
    "this yields a 2-dimensional map as shown in figure [ fig : simple_tunnel](b ) , which contains diamond - shaped regions with well - defined charge number on the dot ( coulomb diamonds ) .",
    "resonant tunnelling features induce a distinct change in current above normal device fluctuations and appear as lines running parallel to the diamond edges .",
    "such features are commonly observed in single - electron devices , however their explanation is often simplistic or lacking .",
    "this is a result of there being many possible sources of resonant tunnelling features , only identifiable via subtle differences in their behaviour .",
    "e above or below the electrochemical potential of the ground state , as indicated by the dashed line in ( a ) . ]    in this article we give an overview of the different resonant tunnelling features expected in bias spectroscopy experiments of single - dot devices .",
    "the discussion is restricted to the most common operating conditions , corresponding to sequential single electron tunnelling .",
    "we review methods for determining the nature of these features with reference to experimental examples , and aim at providing clear guidelines to distinguish between features of different physical origin .",
    "we only consider shifts or extensions of the lines , without discussing their width or shape .",
    "these methods will serve as a resource for the engineer or physicist seeking to explain measurement results or design next generation single - electron devices .",
    "the paper is structured around figure [ fig : summary ] , which summarizes the different conditions that lead to resonant tunnelling features in bias spectroscopy , as well as methods to identify them .",
    "the main distinction we draw is between `` intrinsic features '' , originating from the internal energy level structure of the dot , and `` extrinsic features '' , appearing because of discrete levels or quantized modes in the environment coupled to the dot .    , or due to extrinsic effects .",
    "the response of each scenario to experimental variables is summarized here to aid the identification of the source of resonant tunnelling features .",
    "explanations of each scenario and experimental examples are given in the text.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "electrons are added to a dot when their potential is raised enough to overcome the addition energy , the sum of the energy level spacing and the coulomb repulsion from electrons already on the dot @xcite .",
    "detecting and mapping the addition of electrons is precisely the purpose of a bias spectroscopy experiment , as explained in the previous section .",
    "excited states of the dot that enter the bias window will increase the current due to the introduction of an additional conductance channel .",
    "these states will ideally appear as steps in the current , running parallel to the coulomb diamond edge .",
    "the change in current will not always be step - like , since changing the source - drain bias or gate voltage affects to some degree the tunnel barriers , the confining potential and the coupling to reservoir states .",
    "step - like behaviour will be visible in only one biasing direction if the device contains asymmetric tunnel barriers @xcite .",
    "the excited state spectrum of a dot is a function of the material and operating conditions ( e.g. confinement strength and effective mass ) , with energy level separation varying from the order of @xmath0ev for large quantum dots @xcite up to 100 mev in ultrasmall dots @xcite . in some simple cases ,",
    "the particle - in - a - box approximation @xcite can be used to calculate the orbital level spacing .",
    "this simplification must however be applied with caution , since it often produces a value that seems consistent with experimental observations but could be explained equally well by other phenomena .    varying the size of the dot helps identify resonant tunnelling features as being due to orbital excited states . changing",
    "the dot size will change its excited state spectrum . if the dot size is defined electrostatically , for example through depleting a buried charge layer , then changing the dot size is generally possible by varying the nearby gate potentials .    in a simple rate equation model of sequential tunnelling through a dot @xcite , the current across the left barrier for positive source - drain bias is given by , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the tunnel rate from the dot ground state ( g ) through the right barrier ( r ) , and similarly for the excited state ( e ) and left barrier ( l ) .",
    "@xmath3 represents the probability of occupying the excited ( ground ) state and @xmath4 is its degeneracy . if we assume that the tunnel rate into the ground state is approximately equal to that for the excited state , then equation ( [ eq : rateeq ] ) simplifies to @xmath5 similarly the current under negative bias is given by @xmath6 equations ( [ eq : possimple ] ) and ( [ eq : negsimple ] ) show that in the presence of asymmetric tunnel barriers ( e.g. @xmath7 ) , the magnitude of the current step due to the addition of an excited state to the bias window will be different for positive and negative source - drain bias .",
    "conversely , if the tunnel rate into the excited state is much higher than into the ground state ( @xmath8 ) , then asymmetric barriers will result in both positive and negative bias currents @xmath9 and @xmath10 being dominated by the tunnel rate into the excited state through the rate limiting barrier ( i.e. if @xmath11 , then @xmath12 ) .",
    "higher order tunnelling events through dot states can provide further information on the source of resonant tunnelling features @xcite .",
    "tunnelling processes simultaneously involving two or more electrons ( known as co - tunnelling ) appear in bias spectroscopy as lines traversing coulomb diamonds where transport is normally blocked .",
    "when co - tunnelling lines join resonant tunnelling features in adjacent diamonds , those features must be due to an intrinsic property of the dot .",
    "co - tunnelling has been clearly observed , for example , in a vertical few - electron ingaas quantum dot @xcite as well as in lateral gaas @xcite quantum dots .",
    "the first experimental example of analysis of orbital excited states of a quantum dot via bias spectroscopy was in 1992 @xcite . here",
    ", gate voltage sweeps performed at different source - drain biases showed signatures of 0d dot states , identified by their correspondence with the calculated energy level spacing .",
    "a similar study was completed soon after , generating the first full ` stability diagram ' of conductance in the bias vs gate - voltage plane @xcite .",
    "the excitation spectra and sizes of adjacent coulomb diamonds can provide additional evidence for orbital excited states . as mentioned previously , the addition energy ,",
    "i.e. the energy required to add one electron to a dot , is equal to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the charging energy and @xmath15 the orbital energy .",
    "the addition energies of two consecutive electrons entering the same orbital are equal to @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "the coulomb diamond heights of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 diamond should thus differ by the orbital energy , assuming a constant charging energy .",
    "if higher orbital excited states appear , then the spectra of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 diamond should be the same except for the energy shift , as shown in figure [ fig : orbital_es_adj_diam ] .",
    "this effect has been observed very clearly , for example , in carbon nanotubes @xcite as well as gaas heterostructures @xcite and au nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of discrete quantum states in response to static magnetic fields is well understood @xcite . a magnetic field breaks the spin degeneracy of the ground and excited states .",
    "the resulting split states will be separated by the zeeman enery @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electronic g - factor , @xmath21 is the bohr magneton and @xmath22 is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field . for positive g - factor materials such as silicon ,",
    "the spin - down level becomes the ground state and spin - up the excited state , separated by the zeeman energy @xmath23 .",
    "the net result is that the spin excited state moves at a rate @xmath24 with respect to the coulomb diamond edge , as shown in figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "a clear example of spin excited states has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the observed resonant tunnelling features correspond to spin - split orbital excited states of a single - electron gaas quantum dot .",
    "both the ground state and the orbital excited state are spin - degenerate at 0 t , and split by the zeeman energy as a magnetic field is applied . over the range from 6 t to 10 t the splitting of both ground and orbital states increases by roughly the same amount .",
    "spin excited states have been studied comprehensively in gaas dots @xcite .",
    "detailed measurements at different magnetic fields show how the excited state moves with respect to magnetic field according to @xmath25 .",
    "spin excited states of single dots have also been measured in metal nanoparticles @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , inas nanowires @xcite , si nanowires @xcite , si / ge nanowires @xcite and donors in silicon @xcite .      in some materials degeneracies exist in the carrier band , such as the six - fold conduction band degeneracy in bulk silicon @xcite . restricting the momentum of electrons in a silicon device by applying confining potentials or strain in specific directions can lift this degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the energy separation of the conduction band minima ( valleys ) then causes additional features in a transport spectroscopy measurement , i.e. valley excited states . in quantum dots , breaking all valley degeneracies results in a complicated order of filling of electron states based on the relative size of the orbital level spacing , interaction energies , zeeman energy and valley splitting .",
    "in addition , the valley - orbit interaction can lead to a mixing of the orbital wave functions , such that orbitals and valleys are no longer good quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the situation is usually simpler in donor confinement potentials , where the orbital level spacings are very large . for clarity ,",
    "in the discussion below we shall assume the existence of distinct orbital and valley quantum numbers .    for degenerate multi - valley dots ,",
    "electrons are added to the same orbital in each of the valleys ( figure [ fig : valleys](a ) ) .",
    "valley excited states will be preferentially populated if the valley degeneracy is broken and the exchange and orbital energies are greater than the valley splitting , as in the sketch in figure [ fig : valleys](c ) .",
    "this is due to exchange interaction being negligible for electrons populating different valleys @xcite . here",
    "electrons are added to two different valleys consecutively , resulting in a total spin s=1 for the n=2 state .",
    "this is in contrast to the s=0 state that would result in a single valley dot , where the n=2 ground state is a singlet ( provided the orbital level spacing is larger than the exchange energy @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the zero bias coulomb peaks can therefore be used to help identify the origin of resonant tunnelling features .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : valleys](d ) , the electrochemical potential @xmath26 will not change with increasing magnetic field when parallel spins are consecutively added to a dot ( here n=1@xmath272 ) . adding an electron of opposite spin to the same orbital will however induce an increase in electrochemical potential @xmath28 with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the spin filling of consecutive electrons follows from the evolution of the coulomb peak spacing in ground state magnetospectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this experimental method thus helps to recognize whether the electrons fill different orbitals or different valleys @xcite .",
    ", of the spin filling shown in ( c ) as a function of magnetic field .",
    "adding an electron of opposite spin to the same orbital will increase the coulomb peak spacing for increasing magnetic fields , see e.g. @xmath29 . ]    for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) created in the [ 001 ] plane in silicon , the confinement will be in the same direction as the longitudinal effective mass for two of the six valleys .",
    "these two z - valleys are therefore lower in energy than the four remaining valleys .",
    "the degeneracy of the z - valleys may be broken for a tightly - confined 2deg , depending on the properties of the nearby interface @xcite .",
    "this splitting can be as high as a few mev for strong electric fields and enhanced by applying additional degrees of confinement @xcite . for common operating conditions , the z - valley splitting is linear in the applied field @xcite .",
    "valley excited states are also shifted via an electric field due to the stark effect . for donors in silicon , electric fields exceeding 2 - 3",
    "mv / m will lead to appreciable stark shifting @xcite .",
    "if the donor is near an interface , an accumulating electric field can lead to the hybridization of the donor wavefunctions with those of interface confined states @xcite , leading to vastly different excited states from those observed in the bulk .",
    "splitting of the lowest two * * k**@xmath30 valleys in a silicon inversion layer was first observed in 1966 @xcite .",
    "subsequent experimental work in resonant tunnelling through quantum wells has also led to observation of valley splitting in si / ge @xcite and sio@xmath31/si / sio@xmath31 devices @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study of valley splitting in silicon dots is lacking , although level filling of an soi quantum dot has been reported @xcite . here , the evolution of coulomb peaks with magnetic field reveals a filling of the first five charges with alternating spin - down and spin - up electrons , implying non - degenerate valleys as in the middle panel of figure [ fig : valleys](a ) .",
    "photon and phonon emission and absorption are capable of enhancing current through a dot by offering additional inelastic tunnelling processes .",
    "a resonant tunnelling current upon emission of photons or phonons relies on charge carriers tunnelling into or out of the dot by an inelastic relaxation process . in the case of very low temperatures ,",
    "the number of populated phonon modes vanishes , preventing the absorption of energy from the phonon bath . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "phonon modes become occupied and phonon absorption allows current to flow through the dot when it would be otherwise blockaded at @xmath32 .",
    "photonic / phononic excitations are most easily identified as being independent of magnetic field .",
    "if the process of relaxation or excitation possesses a discrete energy spectrum that becomes resonant with a tunnelling event , additional features will be observed in bias spectroscopy , see figure [ fig : phonon_asymm ] . for the case when a well - defined cavity exists within a device , a discrete phonon energy spectrum will be present and allow enhanced electron tunnelling through emission at discrete energies .",
    "the spacing of resonant tunnelling features due to phonon emission is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the speed and wavelength of the photon / phonon .",
    "in the case of a closed ( open ) cavity the wavelength @xmath35 is equal to 2@xmath36 ( 4@xmath36 ) , where @xmath36 is the length of the photon / phonon cavity that the tunnelling electrons are coupled to .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths thus follow from the energies @xmath37 at which the resonances are observed .    in case of phonon emission , many roughly equidistant resonant tunnelling features appear at energies @xmath38 .",
    "an energy emission of @xmath38 can be described by two possible scenarios : ( i ) one phonon with energy @xmath38 is emitted .",
    "each line corresponds to one phonon mode of energy @xmath38 , hence the modes are equidistant in energy as in a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "such a regular set of phonon modes may well have similar shapes , resulting in comparable electron - phonon couplings and current peak heights for all modes .",
    "( ii ) @xmath39 phonons with energy @xmath15 are emitted .",
    "the latter process requires a very strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite .    for symmetric tunnel barriers , resonant tunnelling features due solely to emission to a discrete phonon spectrum run parallel to both coulomb diamond edges . in the presence of asymmetric tunnel barriers , lines will be visible in only one direction for absorption ( figure [ fig : phonon_asymm](b ) ) and emission ( figure [ fig : phonon_asymm](c ) ) .",
    "if both phonon emission and absorption are present , lines will appear in both directions as shown in figure [ fig : phonon_asymm](d ) .",
    "raising the temperature to stimulate phonon absorption will give a conclusive answer as to whether phonon - assisted tunnelling is the source of resonant features .",
    "conductance peaks in carbon nanotube quantum dots extend into the coulomb blockaded regions upon increasing the device temperature @xcite .",
    "phonon - assisted tunnelling has also been shown to increase the conductance both by spontaneous emission , e.g. @xcite and absorption , e.g. @xcite . in the latter experiment",
    "the absorbed phonons were on - chip generated surface acoustic waves .",
    "another experimental example is the observation of phononic excitations in si nanowires @xcite . here",
    ", the absence of the magnetic field dependence of the resonant tunnelling features provides strong evidence that their origin was phonon emission .",
    "others have explored features in transport spectroscopy of suspended gaas quantum dots where low - bias current is suppressed @xcite .",
    "the ` phonon blockade ' is due to the formation of a ` dressed ' dot - phonon state resulting from strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "bias spectroscopy of single molecule transistors has also allowed the observation of excited states due to vibrational modes of the molecule @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical calculations were able to confirm that the energies of certain molecular vibrational modes matched the observed feature spacing .",
    "similarly , an excitation spectrum of suspended carbon nanotubes was found to be consistent with calculation of its vibrational modes , and an order of magnitude smaller than the dot orbital levels @xcite .    in a manner analogous to phonon absorption , electromagnetic radiation ( i.e. photons )",
    "causes a peak in current when an applied field becomes resonant with an otherwise prohibited tunnelling event , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this photon - assisted tunnelling ( pat ) appears in a bias spectroscopy measurement as an extension of the orbital excited state line into the coulomb diamond , resulting in a similar stability diagram to that shown for phonon absorption in figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "observation of pat through excited dot states is in fact usually achieved at a single ( often zero ) bias @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite demonstrate pat in a gaas quantum dot , observing a dot orbital excited state at zero bias in addition to satellite peaks caused by absorption of the microwave photons .",
    "a more recent experimental example of pat through single dots is the pumping of electrons through excited dot states in carbon nanotubes via application of a high frequency field @xcite .",
    "the frequency independence of certain resonant tunnelling features whilst the device was under irradiation was identified as a signature they were in fact due to excited states of the dot and not due to the reservoirs .",
    "photon - assisted resonant tunnelling through a device consisting of a single donor coupled to source and drain leads has also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "excited states of the donor were observed at zero bias by irradiating the device with a 40 ghz ac signal .",
    "earlier work focused on the additional features introduced by photon absorption in a large quantum dot , but was not used to probe the dot s excited states @xcite .      as discussed earlier , bias spectroscopy requires a source and drain of charge carriers in order to probe the states of the dot .",
    "the properties of these reservoirs will strongly influence the behaviour of the device , and in some cases be themselves the origin of resonant tunnelling features .",
    "the dos of the reservoirs within the bias window determines the availability of charge carriers for tunnelling , hence singularities in the reservoir dos will appear in the bias spectroscopy .    for the case",
    "where the source and drain reservoirs are electrostatically induced two - dimensional charge layers , e.g. from modulation doped heterostructures or gate induced inversion / accumulation layers , the confinement perpendicular to the 2deg plane quantizes the @xmath40-momentum of the carriers into distinct subbands .",
    "discontinuous changes in the 2d dos occur when a different subband becomes occupied .",
    "only the lowest subband is occupied for high confining fields or low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the dos in this 2deg subband is independent of energy ( i.e. constant ) @xcite , and therefore the reservoirs do not contribute any sharp transport feature . however ,",
    "if the width @xmath41 of the reservoirs becomes comparable to the mean free path , @xmath42 , quasi-1d dos features arise .",
    "we use the term ` quasi-1d ' since , if many 1d subbands are occupied , a 2d dos is recovered .",
    "the elastic mean free path is proportional to the mobility , @xmath43 of the 2deg through , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fermi velocity , @xmath46 is the fermi wave vector , @xmath47 is the effective mass and @xmath48 is the elastic scattering time .",
    "typical values for the mean free path are in the range @xmath49 nm in silicon and @xmath50 m in gaas 2degs . for reservoirs with width comparable to or less than @xmath42 , the number of states per subband is given by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the subband energy .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dos ] ) shows that a singularity in the dos is reached at energies equal to any of the subbands .",
    "experimentally , these dos peaks will be asymmetric , rising sharply then falling proportional to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fermi energy . however scattering off lattice , impurity and interface defects often broadens these peaks and make it difficult to observe their @xmath53 rolloff .",
    "the spacing of the subband energy levels can be approximated in a number of ways .",
    "for an electron accumulation / inversion layer , the subbands due to motion perpendicular to the interface are well approximated by the eigenvalues of a triangular well @xcite , @xmath55^{1/3}.\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the conduction band minimum , @xmath57 is the confining electric field and @xmath58 is the subband index . in silicon ,",
    "the longitudinal effective mass applies to electrons populating the * * k**@xmath59-valleys and the transverse effective mass to electrons in the * * k**@xmath60- and * * k**@xmath61- valleys . by changing the magnitude of the confining field two effects",
    "take place : 1 ) the increase in confinement strength changes the subband energies ; and 2 ) the conduction / valence band edge moves relative to the fermi level .",
    "the latter effect will dominate , since changing the field scales the @xmath58 indexed subbands by @xmath62 and has little effect on the width of the inversion layer .",
    "therefore , directly gating the reservoirs helps identifying resonant tunnelling features originating from the source or drain dos , since they will move relative to the coulomb diamond edge .",
    "this is summarized schematically in figure [ fig : summary ] and has recently been demonstrated experimentally @xcite . with asymmetric tunnel barriers , only resonant tunnelling features relevant to the rate limiting barrier will be observed , leading to features running in only one direction in a bias spectroscopy measurement .    in a magnetic field , the dos of the reservoirs and the energy spectrum of the dot split by the zeeman energy .",
    "the splitting will be equal if both reservoir and dot possess the same @xmath20-factor , meaning features in the transport spectroscopy measurement due to the reservoirs will not split .",
    "this is in contrast to spin excited states of the dot itself , see figure [ fig : dos](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "furthermore , the lower energy spin states of the dot ( including the coulomb diamond edge ) will shift down in voltage by e@xmath59/2 while the dos features will not move . plotting the shift of all the features relative to the coulomb diamond edge will show dot states splitting and/or moving by e@xmath63 whereas features originating from the reservoir will move by e@xmath59/2 , as shown in figure [ fig : dos](c ) .",
    "transport spectroscopy features have been attributed to structure in the dos for many years , for example the quasi-1d features observed in narrow mosfet channels @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the influence of the reservoir dos was first seen in the pioneering work on discrete energy levels in metal nanoparticles @xcite . here ,",
    "the bcs dos of the superconducting leads were visible as peaks in the tunnelling current through a single al particle .",
    "the first experimental observations of features in resonant tunnelling through semiconductor quantum dots attributable to peaks in the reservoir dos were achieved in 1997 @xcite . at a later stage others",
    "have made similar observations @xcite , although a study of these features was not the primary objective of their work .",
    "fluctuations in the local dos of disordered reservoirs attributed to interference of diffusive charge carrier wavefunctions also cause features in the transport spectroscopy of quantum dots .",
    "since these features are dominated by disorder , their behaviour in a magnetic field is complicated @xcite if not random @xcite .",
    "they are also independent of devices size and temperature @xcite .",
    "the change in population of a charge centre located in the tunnel barrier or near the reservoirs can also give rise to resonant tunnelling features in bias spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "these features are strongly dependent on the capacitive coupling between the charge centre , the dot and the gate , as well as the proximity of the charge centre energy levels to the reservoir fermi level . for weakly coupled traps",
    ", the resonant features will be the same on all coulomb diamonds @xcite .",
    "strongly coupled charge centres however , produce a more obvious signature where the change in charge centre occupancy results in additional diamonds appearing alongside or in between the original diagram , as shown in figure [ fig : charge_centre ] . in a magnetic field , the states of both the dot and the charge centre will split by the zeeman energy , behaving in the same way as orbital states of the dot .",
    "characterization of the coupling capacitances enables extraction of the location of the charge centre with respect to the gates , and detuning of such charging events .",
    "detailed experimental studies of this type of resonant tunnelling event have been undertaken @xcite .",
    "we note that the coupling between a dot and a nearby charge centre has also been proposed as a method to read out the spin of the charge centre @xcite .",
    "resonant tunnelling features in the bias spectroscopy of quantum dots can arise from a broad range of physical phenomena .",
    "we have shown that the response of a quantum dot to experimentally accessible parameters , such as electric and magnetic fields or the temperature , can be used to identify the nature of the tunnelling features .",
    "this task is important for a variety of reasons , ranging from the basic recognition of the nature of the binding potential due to dopants @xcite , to the assessment of the feasibility of quantum computing schemes in quantum dots @xcite .",
