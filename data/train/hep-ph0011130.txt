    "the most important disadvantage of inflationary scenarios such as the ` new ' @xcite or ` chaotic ' @xcite ones is that they require ` tiny ' coupling constants in order to reproduce the measurements of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) @xcite on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "this difficulty was overcome by linde @xcite who proposed , in the context of non - supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) , the hybrid inflationary scenario .",
    "the basic idea was to use two real scalar fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 instead of one that was normally used .",
    "@xmath3 provides the ` vacuum ' energy density which drives inflation , while @xmath4 is the slowly varying field during inflation .",
    "this splitting of roles between two fields allows us to reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations of the cmbr with ` natural ' ( not too small ) values of the relevant parameters in contrast to previous realizations of inflation .",
    "the scalar potential utilized by linde is @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are dimensionless positive coupling constants and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are mass parameters .",
    "the vacua lie at @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "putting @xmath9=0 , for the moment , we observe that @xmath12 possesses an exactly flat direction at @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 of the field @xmath3 along this flat direction is @xmath16 .",
    "so , for @xmath13 and @xmath17 , we obtain a flat valley of minima . reintroducing @xmath18",
    ", this valley acquires a non - zero slope and the system can inflate as it rolls down this valley .",
    "this scenario is called hybrid since the ` vacuum ' energy density ( @xmath19 ) is provided by @xmath3 , while the slowly rolling field ( inflaton ) is @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 criteria ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) imply that , for the relevant values of parameters ( see below ) , inflation continues until @xmath4 reaches @xmath22 , where it terminates abruptly .",
    "it is followed by a ` waterfall ' , i.e. , a sudden entrance into an oscillatory phase about a global minimum . since the system can fall into either of the two minima with equal probability , topological defects ( monopoles , walls or cosmic strings ) are copiously produced @xcite if they are predicted by the particular particle physics model employed .",
    "so , if the underlying gut gauge symmetry breaking ( by @xmath23 ) leads to the existence of monopoles or walls , we encounter a cosmological catastrophe .",
    "the onset of hybrid inflation requires @xcite that , at a cosmic time of order @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the hubble parameter during inflation , a region exists in the universe with size greater than about @xmath24 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 happen to be almost uniform with negligible kinetic energies and values close to the bottom of the valley of minima .",
    "such a region , at the planck time @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the planck mass ) , would have been much larger than the planck length @xmath28 and it is , thus , very difficult to imagine how it could emerge so homogeneous .",
    "moreover , as it has been argued @xcite , the initial values ( at @xmath29 ) of the fields in this region must be strongly restricted in order to obtain adequate inflation .",
    "several possible solutions to this problem of initial conditions for hybrid inflation have been already proposed ( see e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the quadrupole anisotropy of cmbr produced during hybrid inflation can be estimated , using the standard formulae ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , to be @xmath30 the cobe @xcite result , @xmath31 , can then be reproduced with @xmath32 , the supersymmetric ( susy ) gut vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 for @xmath6 , @xmath35 .",
    "hybrid inflation turns out @xcite to be ` tailor made ' for application to globally susy guts except that an intermediate scale mass for @xmath4 can not be obtained in this context .",
    "actually , all scalar fields acquire masses of order @xmath36 ( the gravitino mass ) from soft susy breaking .",
    "let us consider the renormalizable superpotential @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a conjugate pair of @xmath40 ( the standard model gauge group ) singlet left handed superfields belonging to non - trivial representations of the gut gauge group @xmath41 and reducing its rank by their vevs , and @xmath42 is a gauge singlet left handed superfield . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( @xmath43 ) can be made positive by field redefinitions .",
    "the vanishing of the f - term @xmath44 implies that @xmath45 , whereas the d - terms vanish for @xmath46 .",
    "so , the susy vacua lie at @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( from @xmath49 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath50 leads to the spontaneous breaking of @xmath41 .",
    "the same superpotential @xmath50 gives rise to hybrid inflation .",
    "the potential derived from @xmath50 in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) is @xmath51 d - flatness implies @xmath52 .",
    "we take @xmath53 , so that the susy vacua are contained .",
    "note that @xmath50 possesses a @xmath54 r - symmetry : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "actually , @xmath50 is the most general renormalizable superpotential allowed by @xmath54 and @xmath41 . performing appropriate @xmath41 and r - transformations , we bring @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath42 on the real axis , i.e. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are normalized real scalar fields .",
    "@xmath12 then takes the form in eq.([eq : lindepot ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "so , linde s potential for hybrid inflation is almost obtainable from susy guts but without the mass term of @xmath4 which is , however , crucial for driving the inflaton towards the vacua .    one way to generate the necessary slope along the inflationary trajectory is @xcite to include the one - loop radiative corrections on this trajectory ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "in fact , susy breaking by the ` vacuum ' energy density @xmath64 along this valley causes a mass splitting in the supermultiplets @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "we obtain a dirac fermion with @xmath15 equal to @xmath65 and two complex scalars with @xmath15 equal to @xmath66 .",
    "this leads to the existence of important one - loop radiative corrections to @xmath12 on the inflationary valley which can be found from the coleman - weinberg formula @xcite : @xmath67 where the sum extends over all helicity states @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the fermion number and @xmath15 of the @xmath68th state , and @xmath71 is a renormalization mass scale .",
    "we find that @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the dimensionality of the representations to which @xmath38 , @xmath39 belong .",
    "for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , the effective potential on this trajectory can be expanded as @xcite @xmath78 .",

    ": rc ] ) and using the standard formalism ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , we find that the quadrupole anisotropy of cmbr is @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the number of e - foldings suffered by our present horizon scale during inflation , and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 being the value of @xmath42 when our present horizon scale crossed outside the inflationary horizon . for @xmath85 , @xmath86 . finally , from eq.([eq : rc ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath87    the slow roll conditions ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) for susy hybrid inflation are @xmath88 , where @xmath89 @xmath90 note that @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "however , for most relevant values of the parameters ( @xmath93 , the slow roll conditions are violated only ` infinitesimally ' close to the critical point at @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "so , inflation continues practically until this point is reaches , where the ` waterfall ' occurs .",
    "from the cobe @xcite result , @xmath31 , and eliminating @xmath96 between eqs.([eq : qa ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa ] ) , we obtain @xmath8 as a function of @xmath6 . for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the maximal @xmath8 is achieved in this limit and equals about @xmath100 ( for @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "this value of @xmath8 , although somewhat smaller than the susy gut scale , is quite close to it . as a numerical example , take @xmath103 which gives @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "the slow roll conditions are violated at @xmath107 , where @xmath108 ( @xmath109 at @xmath94 ) .",
    "the spectral index of density perturbations @xmath110 @xcite is @xmath111 .",
    "the susy hybrid inflationary scenario can be considered ` natural ' for the following reasons :    there is no need of ` tiny ' coupling constants ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the superpotential @xmath50 in eq.([eq : superpot ] ) has the most general renormalizable form allowed by the gauge and r - symmetries .",
    "moreover , the coexistence of the @xmath42 and @xmath113 terms in @xmath50 implies that the combination @xmath114 is ` neutral ' under all possible symmetries of @xmath50 and , thus , all the non - renormalizable terms of the form @xmath115 , @xmath116 , are also necessarily present in @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the leading term of this type @xmath117 , if its dimensionless coefficient is of order unity , can be comparable to @xmath113 ( recall that @xmath118 ) and , thus , play an important role in inflation ( see sec.[sec : extensions ] ) .",
    "all higher order terms of this type with @xmath119 give negligible contributions to the inflationary potential .",
    "the presence of @xmath54 is crucial since it guarantees the linearity of @xmath50 in @xmath42 to all orders excluding terms such as @xmath120 which could generate an inflaton mass @xmath121 , thereby ruining inflation by violating the slow roll conditions .",
    "susy guarantees that the radiative corrections do not invalidate @xcite inflation , but rather provide @xcite a slope along the inflationary trajectory , needed for driving the inflaton towards the susy vacua .",
    "supergravity ( sugra ) corrections can be brought under control leaving inflation intact .",
    "the scalar potential in sugra is given @xcite by @xmath122 , \\label{eq : sugra}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the khler potential , @xmath124 in the ` reduced ' planck scale , @xmath125 , and upper ( lower ) indices denote differentiation with respect to the scalar field @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "@xmath123 can be expanded as @xmath128 , where the leading ( quadratic ) terms constitute the ` minimal ' khler potential .",
    "the term @xmath129 , whose coefficient is necessarily normalized to unity , could generate a @xmath130 for @xmath42 along the inflationary trajectory from the expansion of the exponential prefactor in eq.([eq : sugra ] ) .",
    "this would ruin inflation .",
    "fortunately , with this particular form of @xmath50 ( including all the higher order terms ) this @xmath15 is exactly cancelled in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the linearity of @xmath50 in @xmath42 , which is guaranteed to all orders by the r - symmetry , is crucial for this cancellation to take place .",
    "this is an important property of this scheme .",
    "the @xmath131 term in @xmath123 also generates a @xmath15 for @xmath42 via the factor @xmath132 in eq.([eq : sugra ] ) , which is however not cancelled ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . in order to avoid ruining the present inflationary scheme , one has then to assume @xcite that @xmath133 .",
    "all other higher order terms in @xmath123 are harmless since they give suppressed contributions ( @xmath134 on the inflationary path ) .",
    "so , we see that a mild tuning of just one parameter is adequate for controlling sugra corrections .",
    "this is a great advantage of this model since in other cases tuning of infinitely many parameters is required .",
    "moreover , note that with special forms of the khler potential one can solve this problem even without a mild tuning .",
    "an example is given in ref.@xcite , where the dangerous @xmath135 could be cancelled in the presence of fields without superpotential but with large vevs generated via d - terms .",
    "this property practically persists even in the extensions of the model we will consider in sec.[sec : extensions ] .    in summary , for all these reasons",
    ", we consider susy hybrid inflation ( with its extensions ) as an extremely ` natural ' inflationary scenario .",
    "we will now discuss how the susy hybrid inflationary scenario can be ` embedded ' in concrete susy guts . as an example , let us consider a moderate extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) based on the left - right symmetric gauge group @xmath136 ( see refs.@xcite ) .",

    "an important shortcoming of mssm is that there is no understanding of how the susy @xmath0 term , with the right magnitude of @xmath148 , arises .",
    "one way @xcite to solve this @xmath0 problem is via a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xmath149 @xcite , which also solves the strong cp problem .",

    "one of the simplest gut models predicting monopoles is the pati - salam ( ps ) model @xcite based on the gauge group @xmath298 .",
    "these monopoles carry two units of ` dirac ' magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "we will discuss possible solutions @xcite of the magnetic monopole problem of hybrid inflation within the susy ps model , although our mechanisms can be readily extended to other semi - simple gauge groups such as the ` trinification ' group @xmath299 , which emerges from string theory and predicts @xcite monopoles with triple ` dirac ' charge , and possibly to simple gauge groups such as @xmath300 .",
    "one idea @xcite for solving the monopole problem is to include into the standard superpotential for hybrid inflation the leading non - renormalizable term , which , as explained in sec.[subsec : susy ] , can not be excluded by any symmetries .",
    "if its dimensionless coefficient is of order unity , this term can be comparable with the trilinear coupling of the standard superpotential ( whose coefficient is @xmath301 ) .",
    "the coexistence of these terms reveals a completely new picture .",
    "in particular , there appears a non - trivial ( classically ) flat direction along which @xmath302 is spontaneously broken with the appropriate higgs fields ( @xmath297 , @xmath39 ) acquiring constant values .",
    "this ` shifted ' flat direction can be used as inflationary trajectory with the necessary inclination obtained again from one - loop radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the termination of inflation is again abrupt followed by a ` waterfall ' but no monopoles are formed in this transition since @xmath302 is already spontaneously broken during inflation .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the gauge group @xmath302 to @xmath138 is achieved via the vevs of a conjugate pair of higgs superfields @xmath303 in the @xmath304 , @xmath305 directions .",

    "@xmath320 in eq.([eq : vtilde ] ) has extrema at @xmath321 note that the first two extrema ( at @xmath322 , @xmath323 ) are @xmath319-independent and , thus , correspond to classically flat directions , the trivial one at @xmath324 with @xmath325 , and the non - trivial one at @xmath326 with @xmath327 , which we will use as our inflationary path .",
    "the trivial trajectory is a valley of minima for @xmath328 , while the non - trivial one for @xmath329 , which is its instability ( critical ) point .",

    "the extrema at @xmath332 , which are @xmath319-dependent and non - flat , do not exist for all values of @xmath318 and @xmath333 , since the expressions under the square roots in eq.([eq : extrema ] ) are not always non - negative .",
    "these two extrema , at @xmath334 , become the susy vacua . the relevant susy vacuum ( see below ) corresponds to @xmath335 and , thus , the common vev @xmath336 of @xmath337 , @xmath338 is given by @xmath339    we will now discuss the structure of @xmath340 and the inflationary history in the most interesting range of @xmath333 , which is @xmath341 .",

    "as we further decrease @xmath318 below @xmath344 , a pair of new extrema , a local minimum at @xmath345 and a local maximum at @xmath343 , are created between @xmath322 and @xmath323 . as @xmath318 crosses @xmath346 , the local maximum at @xmath343 crosses @xmath323 becoming a local minimum . at the same time , the local minimum at @xmath323 turns into a local maximum and inflation along the ` shifted ' trajectory is terminated with the system falling into the local minimum at @xmath345 which , at @xmath334 , develops into a susy vacuum .",
    "we see that , no matter where the system starts from , it always passes from the ` shifted ' trajectory , where the relevant part of inflation takes place , before falling into the susy vacuum .",
    "so , @xmath302 is already broken during inflation and no monopoles are produced at the ` waterfall ' .",
    "it should be noted that , after inflation , the system could fall into the minimum at @xmath343 instead of the one at @xmath345 .",

    "the gravitino constraint together with the restrictions on the primordial lepton asymmetry ( @xmath398 ) from the low deuterium abundance constraint @xcite on the bau ( @xmath399 ) can be satisfied with ` natural ' values of the relevant parameters and in accord with the neutrino oscillation data .    a typical solution , for @xmath400 ( @xmath401 ) , is @xmath402 , @xmath403 ( @xmath404 ) , @xmath405 , @xmath406 , @xmath407 , @xmath408 , @xmath409 , and @xmath410 ( @xmath411 for @xmath412 ) .",

    "an alternative solution to the monopole problem of hybrid inflation has been proposed @xcite some years ago .",

    "the flat direction at @xmath426 is now a local maximum with respect to @xmath427 for all values of @xmath428 , and two ` new ' symmetric valleys of minima appear @xcite at @xmath429^{\\frac{1}{2}}. \\label{eq : smoothvalley}\\ ] ] they contain the susy vacua which lie at @xmath430 , @xmath431 .",
    "it is important to note that these valleys are not classically flat .",
    "in fact , they possess an inclination already at the classical level , which can drive the inflaton towards the vacua .",
    "thus , there is no need of radiative corrections in this case .",
    "the potential along these paths is given by @xcite @xmath432 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 1-\\frac{1}{216\\tilde\\sigma^4}+\\cdots,~~{\\rm for } ~\\tilde\\sigma\\gg 1 .",

    "inflation does not come to an abrupt end in this case since the inflationary path is stable with respect to @xmath427 for all @xmath428 s .",
    "the value @xmath433 of @xmath428 at which inflation is terminated smoothly is found from the @xmath20 and @xmath21 criteria ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , and the derivatives @xcite of the potential along the inflationary path : @xmath434 , \\label{eq : firstder}\\ ] ] @xmath435 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -(1 + 252\\tilde\\sigma^4)\\left(\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{36\\tilde\\sigma^4}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } -1\\right)\\biggl\\}. \\label{eq : secondder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quadrupole anisotropy of cmbr , @xmath146 , and the number of e - foldings , @xmath436 , of our present horizon during inflation can be found from the standard formulae ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) and using eq.([eq : firstder ] ) .",
    "one advantage of this scenario is that the common vev of @xmath356 , @xmath338 , which is equal to @xmath437 , is not so rigidly constrained and , thus , can be chosen equal to the susy gut scale @xmath438 .",
    "@xmath146 can be approximated @xcite as @xmath439 from the results of cobe @xcite and taking @xmath440 , we obtain @xmath441 , @xmath442 , which are quite ` natural ' .",

    "one can show @xcite that the gravitino and leptogenesis constraints can be satisfied with ` natural ' values of the parameters together with the restrictions from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations and @xmath416 invariance .",

    "we have shown that , in a wide class of susy guts , hybrid inflation arises ` naturally ' , in the sense that no ` tiny ' coupling constants are needed , the superpotential is restricted only by symmetries , and inflation can be protected against radiative and sugra corrections .",
    "this inflationary scenario can be readily incorporated in concrete susy gut models which simultaneously meet a number of other requirements such as the solution of the strong cp and @xmath0 problems ( via a pq symmetry ) , and the generation of ( seesaw ) masses and mixing for light neutrinos .",
    "moreover , in these concrete models , hybrid inflation is followed by a successful ` reheating ' leading to adequate baryogenesis ( via a primordial leptogenesis ) and satisfying the gravitino constraint on the ` reheat ' temperature together with the available solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we give an example of such a susy gut model based on the left - right symmetric gauge group @xmath448 .",
    "natural extensions of the standard susy hybrid inflationary scenario , which still meet all the above requirements , can also solve the problem of the possible monopole overproduction at the end of inflation .",
