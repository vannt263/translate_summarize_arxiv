    "supersymmetric models which involve gmsb mechanism @xcite are popular frameworks for analyzing phenomenology of bsm scenarios mainly due to their flavour universality of soft susy breaking terms . in this letter",
    ", we consider in more details the issue of sfermion masses in extended gmsb scenario .",
    "let us start by reviewing situation within pure gmsb scheme .",
    "it is well - known that in such setups , 1-loop @xmath4-terms and 1-loop soft masses of sfermions @xmath5 are zero at the messenger scale @xmath2 .",
    "the first non - trivial contribution to soft masses arise at 2-loop level and can be written as @xcite : [ m2g2 ] ( m^2_i)_g,2=2n_r()^2c^r_i(mx)^2f_g,2(x ) where @xmath6 are gauge couplings for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 groups , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is twice the sum of the dynkin indices of the messenger fields , @xmath11 is the quadratic casimir related to @xmath5 , while @xmath12 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath1 are real . ] which sets the relation between @xmath1-term of the spurion , @xmath1 , and the messenger scale @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the function @xmath13 , [ f2 g ] f_g,2(x)&= & + & & + ( x - x ) only mildly depends on @xmath14 such that the overall scale of is set by @xmath15 .",
    "this quantity is crucial for the phenomenology of gmsb models . to arrange masses of sfermions at the level of a few @xmath16 , such that sparticles are accessible at the lhc2 or at one of its successors , and to avoid fine - tuning of parameters , the scale @xmath17 has to be of the order of @xmath18",
    "this allows us to consider the following relation between is very often written as @xmath19 , see e.g. @xcite and sometimes denoted by @xmath20 , see @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath14 [ mx ] mx = c_10 ^ 5 , where @xmath21 is a numerical constant of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "its precise value depends on the details of the model ( e.g. @xmath22 , @xmath23-term ) .",
    "however , the gmsb models are not flexible enough to fulfil all phenomenological restrictions and simultaneously retain .",
    "for example , it is hard to accommodate for @xmath24 higgs boson mass when sfermions are relatively light @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the above mentioned issue can be alleviated within so - called extended gmsb ( egmsb ) models in which one allows for superpotential coupling between messenger and mssm fields . beside addressing enhancement of the higgs boson mass",
    ", egmsb models also provide reasonable framework for exploring non - minimal flavour violation scenarios within various gut models @xcite . as a result of the presence of additional contributions to soft terms ,",
    "egmsb models exhibit rich and interesting phenomenology in which e.g. light stops can be naturally realized @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that in egmsb models both 1- and 2-loop soft masses are generated by the messenger - mssm superpotential couplings .",
    "the 1-loop masses are known analytically for any @xmath25 and one can show that they are negative and @xmath26 for @xmath27 . on the other hand only the leading term in @xmath12 of the 2-loop contribution to soft masses",
    "it has been extracted with the help of the wave - function renormalization method @xcite , which captures only contributions of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "one can show that for @xmath27 the 2-loop contributions to soft masses are positive and @xmath29 .",
    "naively , taking into account above considerations one expects that 1-loop contributions could start to dominate for @xmath30 .",
    "though , such rough estimation does not take into account higher powers of @xmath14 in the expansion of 2-loop masses , but also does not encounter numerical factors which originate from contracting tensors related to the representations of chiral superfields @xcite .",
    "let us recall that in many gut models the messenger scale is chosen rather large , , where @xmath31 is the planck scale .",
    "if is satisfied then @xmath32 .",
    "hence in the models with @xmath33 the gravitino mass is of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "such light gravitino may be of some importance for the cosmology , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "] e.g. @xmath35 , what due to forces @xmath14 to be of the order of @xmath36 . as mentioned above for such choice of @xmath14 the full form of the loop function",
    "is not necessary - only the leading term is relevant .",
    "however , there are also interesting setups , so - called low - scale gauge mediation models with relatively light messengers @xmath37 which provide interesting phenomenology , see e.g. @xcite . in this situation @xmath14 can be much larger , even of order 1 . in this regime wave - function method",
    "is not adequate . to provide more accurate estimation of soft masses",
    ", one needs full analytical 2-loop expression .",
    "our aim is to calculate such full analytical formula for 2-loop soft masses of sfermions which is valid for all @xmath25 , examine its relation to 1-loop soft masses and check for which values of @xmath14 full analytical expressions are important . to derive them ,",
    "we adopt a general method presented in @xcite , which is suitable for 2-loop susy calculations , and conventions therein .",
    "we consider a egmsb - type model in which a pair of messengers , @xmath38 , @xmath39 couple to mssm fields @xmath40 , @xmath41 via superpotential term @xmath42 and susy is broken by vev of @xmath1-term of spurion superfield @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , the relevant part of the superpotential is of the following form : [ wh ] w_h = xy+h_1_2y .",
    "the model has symmetry @xmath44 and , moreover , one can assign global @xmath9 charges to @xmath45 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 such that those fields can not mix with each other even after susy breaking .",
    "an example of such assignment is the following : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . due to the above - mentioned symmetries : ( i ) both fields",
    "@xmath50 obtain the same soft mass @xmath51 , ( ii ) there is no mixing mass term @xmath52 in the scalar potential , and ( iii ) there is no mass term of the form @xmath53 finally , ( iv ) one can get rid of any complex phase of @xmath54 just by a redefinition of messenger fields : @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath57 is real .",
    "an example of superpotential interaction is a coupling between up higgs @xmath58 , up quark @xmath59 and messenger @xmath60 in the representation @xmath61 of @xmath62 .",
    "when spurion field gets vev @xmath63 , all components of messenger multiplets obtain masses @xmath2 , while scalar components get extra susy breaking masses @xmath64 .",
    "after unitary rotation of the scalar components of messengers @xmath65 to the basis @xmath66 in which their mass terms are diagonal , the scalar potential is of the form : v&=&m^2_+|y_+|^2+m^2_-|y_-|^2 + & & + + & & + h^2(|_1|^2+|_2|^2)|y_+-y_-|^2 , where @xmath67 and @xmath12 .",
    "let us remark that @xmath14 has an upper bound , related to the upper bound on the mass of @xmath68 , i.e. on @xmath69 . because @xmath68 can have the same quantum charges as quark superfields hence lhc bound on squarks masses @xmath70 @xcite apply to @xmath68 as well .",
    "however , for the simplicity , in this letter we assume a little more conservative bound : [ mminus ] m_-10 ^ 4 , such that @xmath68 is significantly heavier than all sfermions .",
    "otherwise @xmath68 may , in some cases , alter stability of the scalar potential , what in turn can be dangerous for ewsb . using definition of @xmath71 , the condition can be rewritten in the following form : [ xbound ] x1-()^2 .",
    "it ensures that below the scale of @xmath72 one gets only mssm fields .",
    "for example , when @xmath73 , @xmath14 has to be smaller than about @xmath74 , but for @xmath35 , that limit is practically equal to @xmath3 and may indicate a kind of severe fine - tuning of parameters : @xmath75 . additionally , taking into account",
    "the bound can be rewritten as : [ xbound2 ] x1- .",
    "let us summarize our discussion . for @xmath27",
    ", the 2-loop soft masses can be obtained with the help of the wave - function renormalization method .",
    "we also know that the regime @xmath76 is interesting for the phenomenology of low - scale gauge mediation models .",
    "but for @xmath33 the wave - function method is not adequate . hence , to fill that gap",
    ", we shall discuss full analytical result for 2-loop masses generated by .",
    "for the completeness , we shall present 1-loop @xmath4-terms and 1-loop soft masses in the discussed model .",
    "we omit soft masses of gauginos because at the 1-loop level they are of the same form as in the standard gmsb models @xcite .",
    "the 1-loop soft mass of @xmath45 is [ m2h1 ] m^2_h,1=(-)(mx)^2x^2f_h,1(x ) , where the function @xmath77 is defined as follows : [ fh1 ] f_h,1(x)&= & + & = & 1+x^2+x^4+  .",
    "( ) on the other hand the @xmath4-term is : [ a1 ] a=-2mxf_h , a(x ) , where f_h , a(x)&= & + & = & 1+x^2+x^4  .",
    "( ) it is clear that both @xmath78 and @xmath4 diverge when @xmath79 .",
    "the reason for that is the massless scalar @xmath68 which is present in the 1-loop diagrams @xcite and leads to the divergence of the following contribution @xmath80 to the self - energy @xmath81 at zero momentum @xmath82 . to ensure that the perturbative expansion in @xmath83 does not break down ,",
    "the following conditions has to be satisfied [ pert ] |1-x| ( ) . to find 1-loop pole mass @xmath84 of @xmath45 at @xmath85 one could solve the full propagator equation @xmath86 numerically .",
    "the discussed behaviour of and is not a big problem because phenomenology restricts @xmath14 to the regime which is safe from divergence .",
