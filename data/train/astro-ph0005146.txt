    "the boroson and green ( 1992 , bg92 ) `` eigenvector 1 '' ( ev1 ) is one of the reasons nls1 are interesting , and why we are having a meeting about them .",
    "ev1 ( also called principal component 1 ) is a linear combination of correlated optical and x - ray properties representing the greatest variation among a set of spectra . ev1 links narrower ( blr ) h@xmath0 with stronger h@xmath0 blue wing , stronger feii optical emission , and weaker [ oiii]@xmath15007 emission from the nlr , with steeper soft x - ray spectra ( laor et al . 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "the narrower h@xmath0 defining nls1s has been suggested to result from lower black hole masses , and therefore higher accretion rates relative to the eddington limit in these luminous agn .",
    "the nls1s steep x - ray spectra are also suggested to tie in with high eddington accretion rates ( e.g. laor , these proceedings ) .    in order to understand these relationships ,",
    "we have extended the optical spectra of an essentially complete sample of 22 pg qsos to uv wavelengths .",
    "the qsos of our sample are selected ( by laor et al .",
    "1994 ) to have low galactic hydrogen absorption in order to derive reliable soft x - ray slopes and intrinsic absorption .",
    "the uncertainties in absorption correspond to less than 5% uncertainty in flux density at ly@xmath2 .",
    "five of these qsos are nlq1s l@xmath3 , h@xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ) , where nuclear light dominates that from the host galaxy , and the lower luminosity seyfert galaxies .",
    "we refer to qsos with narrow blr h@xmath0 as nlq1s . ]",
    "( with h@xmath0 fwhms @xmath6 km s@xmath5 ) : pg 1001 + 054 ( a bal qso , 1740 km s@xmath5 ) , pg 1115 + 407 ( 1720 km s@xmath5 ) , pg 1402 + 261 ( 1910 km s@xmath5 ) , pg 1440 + 356 ( mrk 478 , 1450 km s@xmath5 ) and pg 1543 + 489 ( 1560 km s@xmath5 ) . for comparison with x - ray selected samples ,",
    "we note that the @xmath7 color criterion for selecting the pg qsos ( schmidt & green 1983 ) is roughly equivalent to the hardness - ratio criterion ( hr1 @xmath80 ) used to select soft x - ray agns ( e.g. grupe et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we address different aspects of the eigenvector 1 relationships : ( i ) the correlations among uv and optical emission lines , and soft x - ray slope .",
    "we also present the eigenvector 1 uv - optical relationships via a spectral principal component analysis .",
    "( ii ) we show relationships among line widths , and ( iii ) we show new relationships between the uv - optical and x - ray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "we show how the 5 nlq1s of our sample fit into these relationships .",
    "examples of our spectra , over the entire uv - optical range , presented in order of optical ev1 , are shown in fig.1 ( see also wills et al .",
    "1999a , b , francis & wills 1999 ) .",
    "inspection shows that , with changing ev1 , in the sense of decreasing h@xmath0 width and increasing strength of the feii(optical ) blends , the uv spectrum changes : civ@xmath11549 is weaker and broader , siiii]@xmath11892 and nearby feiii blends become more prominent relative to ciii]@xmath11909 , and the strength of low - ionization oi@xmath11304 and cii@xmath11335 increases .",
    "low velocity civ gas appears to be strongly related to the optical nlr [ oiii]@xmath15007 emission ( brotherton & francis 1999 ) . because siiii]@xmath11892 has a higher critical density than the ciii ] transition , we surmise that increasing feii(optical ) , and narrower h@xmath0 , correspond to the increasing contribution from very dense gas , @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "unexpectedly , the high - ionization nv@xmath11240 line strength appears to increase with increasing density .",
    "we speculate that the higher - density gas is nitrogen enriched , and the copious dense gas is a result of circumnuclear starbursts . as suggested by bg92 , this dense gas reduces the flux of ionizing photons reaching the more extended nlr , resulting in the inverse feii(optical)[oiii ] relationship . in fig.1 the continuum of pg1114 + 445 is seen to be significantly reddened ; apparently dust is associated with the high - ionization uv line absorption and the x - ray warm absorption in this qso ( george et al .",
    "1997 ; mathur et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "some correlations between optical ev1 parameters and new uv emission - line parameters are illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "the nlq1s are distinguished by filled circles .",
    "the two - tailed probability of these correlation arising from truly unrelated variables ranges from 1 in 50 to 1 in @xmath11 .",
    "note that nlq1s also contribute to these trends . in the uv they have weaker , broader civ , stronger nv , stronger low - ionization lines and more dense gas ( as indicated by a larger ratio , siiii]@xmath11892/ciii]@xmath11909 ) .",
    "note also that correlations with the x - ray spectral index @xmath12 exist despite the characteristic rapid x - ray variability of the nlq1s .",
    "the above trends can be illustrated in another informative way .",
    "fig.3 shows the mean spectrum in the h@xmath0 region ( left ) and in the range from civ@xmath11549 to h@xmath2 ( right ) .",
    "ly@xmath2 is excluded to avoid the complication of strong absorption in a few objects .",
    "a standard deviation spectrum in the middle panel shows that most of the spectrum - to - spectrum variation appears to arise from emission from low - velocity gas .",
    "this is true for ly@xmath2 , civ , the balmer lines , and feii(optical ) blends . because the sample is small",
    "we show only the first eigenvector , approximately equivalent to bg92 s ev1 ( lower panel ) .",
    "now we can see which parts of the spectrum vary together or are anticorrelated .",
    "the well - known bg92 correlation between the blended feii(optical ) emission and the narrow blr h@xmath0 shows clearly , as well as their anticorrelation with narrow [ oiii]@xmath134959,5007 .",
    "detailed inspection of the h@xmath0 region shows that the lower - velocity gas of the feii(optical ) emission contributes most to the correlations .",
    "( compare the resolved peaks in the middle and lower panels with the smoother feii(optical ) blends in the mean spectrum ) .",
    "the uv feii blends between about 2200  and 3600(log@xmath1 between 3.34 and 3.56 ) appear anticorrelated with the strength of optical feii blends  probably an effect of optical depth in the optically - thick uv resonance transitions , giving rise to the lower optical depth feii optical transitions .",
    "this is consistent with the explanation for the weaker [ oiii ] in objects with strong feii(optical ) emission .",
    "this simple interpretation is preliminary but serves to relate the significant correlations with the overall spectrum .",
    "spectral principal component analysis is a powerful tool for analysing linear correlations .",
    "possibly nls1-type gas is actually present in all qsos , but with differing contributions to the overall spectra .",
    "if so , this would represent a different point of view on the significance of nls1 line widths .",
    "one point remains clear  the luminous nls1s are , spectroscopically , simply more extreme than broader - line qsos , but not fundamentally different .",
    "in a sample with a wide range in luminosity , line width is seen to increase with luminosity .",
    "this leads one to question whether the defining criterion for nls1s or nlq1s should be a function of luminosity ! even for our small sample the trends of fwhm with luminosity are just significant at the @xmath14% level .",
    "the data are consistent with a ( luminosity)@xmath15 dependence of linewidth expected if gravity dominates the cloud motions ( e.g. laor , these proceedings ) . anyway , within our sample , ev1 dominates the spectrum - to - spectrum variations .",
    "correlations between the widths of the uv broad lines and that of h@xmath0 are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the widths of ciii]@xmath11909 and h@xmath0 are strongly correlated , and similarly within the same qso spectrum .",
    "the lower - ionization ciii ] emission probably arises in the same region as h@xmath0 .",
    "it seems surprising that the widths of the hydrogen lines , h@xmath0 and ly@xmath2 , are not correlated .",
    "neither ly@xmath2 or civ widths are correlated with ciii ] or h@xmath0 widths .",
    "ly@xmath2 and civ widths are correlated with each other , however ( significant at the 0.01% level , 2-tailed ) .",
    "we recall that the strength of the lower - velocity civ emission is strongly correlated with the strength of [ oiii]@xmath15007 emission ( figs .",
    "so part of the civ profile becomes _ narrower _ as feii(optical ) increases , or as h@xmath0 becomes _",
    "broader_. so the lack of correlation between civ and h@xmath0 widths is not so surprising .",
    "this lower - velocity civ - emitting region , called the ilr , an intermediate line region between the highest - velocity vblr and the nlr , was related to other uv lines in high redshift qsos by wills et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and brotherton et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) ( see also , brotherton & francis 1999 ) . the trends for high - z qsos are consistent with our present results for the low - redshift qso sample .",
    "note that the ` narrow - line ' qsos ( e.g. , foltz et al .",
    "1987 , baldwin et al .",
    "1988 ) refer to the strength of the ilr in civ  inversely related to the width of h@xmath0 that defines the nls1s and nlq1s ! the results of the previous section ( fig.3 ) show that much of the feii(optical ) emission has narrow widths like h@xmath0 , consistent with both species arising in the same dense gas .",
    "the h@xmath0 widths have been suggested as an indicator of low black hole mass for nls1s ( laor , these proceedings ) .",
    "it has been suggested that h@xmath0 and ciii ] might arise from an optically - thick disk , and civ and ly@xmath2 may be produced in a high - ionization wind ( murray & chiang 1998 , bottorff et al .",
    "1997 , knigl & kartje 1994 ) .",
    "if the emission lines are produced by different kinematic gas components , then a direct kinematic interpretation of their fwhm is not reasonable .",
    "note that the line widths for ly@xmath2 and civ are always broader than that of h@xmath0 for the nlq1s in our sample .",
    "this may be consistent with the suggestion that nlq1s tend to be lower mass objects with high accretion rates that drive an outflow ; the higher - ionization lines may be partly broadened by radiation - pressure driven outflow .",
    "we compare our well - calibrated hst - mcdonald spectral energy distributions with the rosat soft x - ray spectra ( h@xmath2 to 2 kev , fig.5 ) .",
    "the spectra are separated by equal logarithmic increments in @xmath16 at the continuum wavelength of h@xmath2 .",
    "while it is difficult to illustrate with just the few spectra of fig.5 , we find some interesting trends in the whole sample :    * qsos with strong uv absorption lines have redder optical - uv continuua , and either weaker or flatter soft x - ray spectra .",
    "this is the case for the following qsos of our sample : 1114 + 445 , 1411 + 442 , 1309 + 355 ( radio intermediate ) , 1001 + 054 ( a nlq1 ) , and 1425 + 267 ( radio - loud ) .",
    "* relative to the optical - uv spectra , anchored at the h@xmath2 continuum , the soft x - ray spectra point towards the uv spectra  either having a steeper x - ray continuum with weaker hard x - rays , or a flatter , but stronger x - ray spectrum .",
    "this effect is significant for the whole sample at about the 3@xmath17 level . * the well - known trend for radio - loud qsos to have stronger , flatter soft x - ray continua is shown clearly for pg 1226 + 023 ( 3c273 ) and pg 1512 + 370 ( 4c37.43 ) ( not illustrated here ) .",
    "the nlq1s partake of these trends ( although none in our sample is radio - loud ) .",
    "the nlq1s of our sample follow the eigenvector 1 relationships demonstrated for the whole qso sample in figs.1 and 2 . not only is this true for the h@xmath0[oiii ] region , but it extends to the uv spectra as well .",
    "the nlq1s therefore show narrow ciii]@xmath11909 emission lines , small ratios of civ@xmath11549/ly@xmath2 , larger ratios of nv@xmath11240/ciii]@xmath11909 , siiii]@xmath11892/ciii]@xmath11909 , and @xmath11400/ly@xmath2 .",
    "these trends suggest copious amounts of high - density gas in nlq1s , which is probably the same gas that suppresses the ionizing - photon flux available to the extended nlr .",
    "strong nitrogen emission suggests that the gas may be enriched , perhaps by starbursts from mergers that fuel the high eddington accretion rates in nlq1s .      the soft x - ray spectra ` point at ' the uv continuum .",
    "the steep x - ray spectra of the nlq1s correspond to strong uv bumps in these qsos .",
    "however , absorption apparently causes reddening of the optical - uv seds , strong uv line absorption , and suppression of soft x - rays .",
