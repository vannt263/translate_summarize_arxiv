    "there is a significant number of problems of gas dynamics at which it is necessary to use the mathematical apparatus beyond the limits of traditional hydrodynamics of navier - stokes .",
    "the hydrodynamics is valid under the condition for the knudsen number @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a mean free path , and @xmath2 is a characteristic scale of inhomogeneity of a problem under consideration .",
    "the first work , in which wave perturbations of a gas were investigated from the point of view of more general kinetic approach , perhaps , is the paper of wang of chang and uhlenbeck @xcite .",
    "most consistently these ideas are formulated in the work of foch and ford @xcite .",
    "such general theory could be based on some kinetic approach , i.e. boltzman equation .",
    "numerous researches on a sound propagation in a homogeneous gas at arbitrary knudsen numbers were made @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "the investigations have shown , that at arbitrary knudsen numbers the behaviour of a wave differs considerably from ones predicted on a basis of hydrodynamical equations of navier - stokes .",
    "these researches have revealed two essential features : first , propagating perturbations keep wave properties at larger values of @xmath3 , than it could be assumed on the basis of a hydrodynamical description .",
    "secondly , at @xmath4 such concepts as a wave vector and frequency of a wave become ill - determined .",
    "the case , when knudsen number @xmath3 is non - uniform in space or in time is more difficult for investigation and hence need more simplifications in kinetic equations or their model analogues .",
    "a constructions of such approaches for analytical solutions based on kinetic equation bhatnagar  gross  krook ( bgk ) of gross - jackson @xcite in a case of exponentially stratified gas were considered at @xcite    in this paper we would develop and generalize the method of a piecewise continuous partition functions @xcite to take into account the complete set of nonlinearities ( ? ) .",
    "we consider the example of wave perturbations theory for a gas stratified in gravity field so that the knudsen number exponentially depends on the ( vertical ) coordinate .",
    "the kinetic equation with the model integral of collisions in bgk form looks like : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the distribution function of a gas , @xmath7 is time , @xmath8 is velocity of a particle of a gas , @xmath9 is coordinate , @xmath10 is the local - equilibrium distribution function , @xmath11 is the so - called height of a homogeneous atmosphere - a parameter of the gas stratification , @xmath12 is the average thermal speed of movement of particles of gas , @xmath13 is the effective frequency of collisions between particles of gas at height @xmath14 .",
    "it is supposed , that density of gas @xmath15 , its average speed @xmath16 and temperature @xmath17 are functions of time and coordinates .",
    "following the idea of the method of piecewise continuous distribution functions let s search for the solution @xmath18 of the equations  ( [ q2 ] ) as combinations of two locally equilibrium distribution functions , each of which gives the contribution in its own area of velocities space : @xmath19 here @xmath20 are parameters of locally equilibrium distributions functions .",
    "geometry of break , that is the area , in which various functions operate , is determined by geometry of a problem .",
    "thus , a set of the parameters determining a state of the perturbed gas is increased twice .",
    "the increase of the number of parameters of distribution function ( [ q2 ] ) results in that the distribution function generally differs from a local - equilibrium one and describes deviations from hydrodynamical regime . in the range of small knudsen numbers",
    "@xmath21 we have @xmath22 and distribution function ( [ q2 ] ) tends to local - equilibrium one , reproducing exactly the hydrodynamics of navier - stokes . in the range of big knudsen numbers",
    "the formula  ( [ q2 ] ) gives solutions of collisionless problems .",
    "similar ideas have resulted successfully in a series of problems .",
    "for example , in papers @xcite  -  @xcite a method of piecewise continuous partition function was demonstrated for the description of flat and cylindrical ( neutral and plasma ) kuette flows  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "thus for a flat problem the surface of break in the velocity space was determined by a natural condition @xmath23 , and in a cylindrical case @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , accordingly , vertical and radial components of velocity of particles .",
    "similar problem was solved by perturbations caused by pulse movement of plane  @xcite . solving a problem of of a shock wave structure  @xcite the solution",
    "was represented as a combination of two locally equilibrium functions , one of which determines the solution before front of a wave , and another - after .",
    "in the problem of condensation / evaporation of drops of a given size  @xcite a surface break was determined by so - called `` cone of influence '' , thus all particles were divided into two types : flying `` from a drop '' and flying `` not from a drop '' .",
    "the similar approach was developed for a description of a nonlinear sound in stratified gas  @xcite .",
    "the idea of a method of two - fold distribution functions given by  ( [ q2 ] ) is realized as follows .",
    "let s multiply equation bgk  ( [ q1 ] ) on a set of linearly independent functions .",
    "in the one - dimensional case @xmath27 the following set is used : @xmath28    let s define a scalar product : @xmath29 @xmath30 here @xmath31 is density , @xmath32 is specific momentum , @xmath33 is internal energy per unit mass of the gas , @xmath34 is the diagonal component of the strain tensor ( @xmath35 is pressure , @xmath36 is component of strain tensor ) , @xmath37 is a vertical component of a heat flow , @xmath38 is the new parameter having meaning of a heat flow .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ q1 ] ) on eigen functions  ( [ q3 ] ) we obtain the system of differential equations : @xmath39    @xmath40    the obtained system ( [ q13 ] ) of the equations according to the derivation scheme is valid at all frequencies of collisions and within the limits of high frequencies should transform to the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it is a system of hydrodynamical type and generalizes the classical equations of a viscous fluid on any density , down to a free - molecule flow .",
    "however , the system ( [ q13 ] ) is not closed yet .",
    "it is necessary to add equations of state @xmath41 and @xmath42 . except for",
    "that it is necessary to present values of two integrals @xmath43 and @xmath44 as functions of thermodynamic parameters of the system ( [ q13 ] ) .",
    "let s evaluate integrals ( [ q14 ] ) directly , plugging the function ( [ q2 ] ) .",
    "we estimate the functions @xmath45 as small , that corresponds to small mach numbers @xmath46 .",
    "values of integrals @xmath43 and @xmath44 within the specified approximation looks as @xmath47 \\ , \\vspace{2 mm } \\\\   { \\displaystyle}j_2 = \\frac{3}{16 }   ( n^+ { v_t^+}^4 + n^- { v_t^-}^4 ) +   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi } }   [ n^+ { v_t^+}^3 ( u^+ - u ) - n^- { v_t^-}^3 ( u^- - u ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ]",
    "let s express parameters of the two - fold distribution function ( [ q2 ] ) through the thermodynamic ones and substitute the result into the expression ( [ q16 ] ) .",
    "to solve the specified problem we shall use a method of perturbations with the small parameter @xmath48 , expressing @xmath49 plugging the values of ( [ uv ] ) into ( [ q16 ] ) one obtain the values of @xmath50 in the first order : @xmath51",
    "let us consider a system in the hydrodynamical limit ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "it follows from the last three equations of the system ( [ q13 ] ) that the orders of values relate as @xmath53 .",
    "next assume @xmath54 in the zero order by the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "one hence have @xmath56 at the l.h.s . and at the r.h.s .",
    "of forth equation of the system @xmath57 . substituting mentioned limits in the first three equations of the system ( [ q13 ] )",
    "we obtain a system of euler equations of a liquid in gravity field : @xmath58 the functions @xmath59 belong to the next order of the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "then from the last three equations of the system , ( [ q13 ] ) taking into account the equation of state @xmath60 , one obtains following relations @xmath61    further substituting ( [ q23 ] ) in the first three equations of the system ( [ q13 ] ) we obtain @xmath62 system ( [ q24 ] ) is the system of equation of a non - ideal liquid , to compare it with the navier - stokes equations , we continue the evaluation of viscosity factor and coefficient of heat conductivity .",
    "expressions for strain tensor and heat flow tensor in one - dimensional hydrodynamics take a form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the viscosity factor , and @xmath65 is the coefficient of heat conductivity .",
    "comparing mentioned expressions with corresponding items in equations ( [ q24 ] ) we obtain @xmath66 that coincides with the well known relations , given , for example , in @xcite . finding the prandtl number , taking into account of molecular thermal capacity of the ideal gas under constant pressure @xmath67",
    ", we obtain @xmath68 that do not coincide with the prandtl number of ideal gas ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the wrong prandtl number is the main disadvantage of bgk model , that , however , can be removed by changing to the more exact models of collision integral , for example , of gross - jackson @xcite .",
    "for a closure of the system we use the equation of state of ideal gas .",
    "linearized system of the equations ( [ q22 ] ) is given by @xmath70 for convenience we would introduce new notations @xmath71 for hydrodynamical variables : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
