    "over the past several years , the compounds bite@xmath3 ( @xmath3 = cl , br , or i ) have been the subject of a number of studies .",
    "interest in these compounds first surged when it was discovered via spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy that bitei displays an enormous rashba - like spin splitting of the bulk electronic bands  @xcite .",
    "similar behavior was also observed in the cl and br analogues  @xcite . although large rashba splittings had previously been observed for surfaces  @xcite , interfaces  @xcite , and thin films  @xcite , bitei was the first material found to exhibit such large splittings in the bulk .",
    "these materials may be useful for applications because they permit the creation and manipulation of spin polarized currents , and could allow the development of spintronic devices based on non - magnetic materials  @xcite .",
    "interest in the bite@xmath3 family of compounds further increased following a first principles prediction by bahramy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that bitei should undergo a band inversion and transition from trivial insulator to topological insulator under the application of a modest pressure of a few gpa . the strong - spin orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry in this compound",
    "was predicted to lead to conspicuously different surface states on opposite sides of the material .",
    "subsequently , a number of experimental efforts sought to find evidence for the proposed pressure - induced band inversion .",
    "infrared spectroscopy  @xcite and quantum oscillation data  @xcite are consistent with the existence of a band inversion at 3 - 5 gpa .",
    "however , given the limitations on the types of probes that can be applied at high pressure , no experimental effort has yet directly accessed the the surface states in the high pressure topologically non - trivial state . on the other hand , dirac surface states have been observed in bitecl , which appears to exist in the topologically non - trivial state at ambient pressure  @xcite .    some properties of bite@xmath3 compounds have also been probed at substantially higher pressures .",
    "for example , a recent paper reported the results of electrical transport and raman spectroscopic measurements on bitecl to 50 gpa  @xcite .",
    "changes in the raman spectra near 5 and 35 gpa are suggestive of structural transitions at these pressures .",
    "the electrical resistivity measurements show a dramatic increase in the resistivity upon increasing pressure above 5 gpa and a superconducting transition that appears at 10 gpa and reaches a maximum of @xmath4 near 15 - 20 gpa .",
    "this work proposed that bitecl - i ( 0 - 5 gpa ) is a semiconductor , bitecl - ii ( 5 - 35 gpa ) an insulator , and bitecl - iii a metal , with superconductivity appearing in both the insulating ( ii ) and metallic ( iii ) phases . while nominally an insulator , it is probable that phase - ii of bitecl is actually a low carrier density metal , through _",
    "_ site disorder , and is therefore capable of supporting a superconducting state . in another work ,",
    "the crystal structures of bitei were determined up to 30 gpa using high pressure x - ray diffraction  @xcite .",
    "it was found that bitei makes transitions from the ambient pressure bitei - i phase ( @xmath5 ) to bitei - ii ( @xmath6 ) near 9 gpa , with an additional structural transition to bitei - iii ( @xmath1 ) occurring near 19 gpa .    in the present work ,",
    "we report electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements on bitei to pressures as high as @xmath0 gpa .",
    "these measurements show that superconductivity appears in the high pressure metallic bitei - iii phase .",
    "the size of the transition in the ac susceptibility is consistent with @xmath7 shielding , which rules out impurity phases as the source of the superconductivity .    to understand these results , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of electronic structure , electron - phonon interaction in the high pressure phase - iii up to 40 gpa using quantum espresso and superconducting critical temperatures from the mcmillan equation .",
    "both the magnitude and pressure dependence of @xmath2 are qualitatively consistent with experiment , suggesting that the superconductivity in this high pressure phase is driven by the conventional electron - phonon interaction .",
    "single crystals of bitei were grown by the chemical vapor transport method .",
    "small pieces of sample with dimensions of about @xmath8 were cut from a larger crystal for each of the measurements .",
    "the zero - field resistivity measurements as well as the ac magnetic susceptibility ( acs ) measurements were carried out in a omnidac gas membrane - driven diamond anvil cell from almax - easylab .",
    "the cell was placed inside a custom , continuous flow cryostat built by oxford instruments .",
    "optical access to the cell was provided through windows at the bottom of the cryostat and an optical fiber entering through a feed - through at the top , allowing pressure to be measured at low temperature .",
    "the pressure was calibrated using the fluorescence of the @xmath9 peak of small ruby spheres placed next to the sample  @xcite .",
    "the high - field resistivity measurements were performed in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) using an almax - easylab chicagodac .    for the resistivity measurements ,",
    "one of the diamonds used was a designer diamond anvil containing eight symmetrically arranged , deposited tungsten microprobes encapsulated in high - quality homoepitaxial diamond  @xcite .",
    "this diamond had a culet diameter of @xmath10 , and the opposing anvil had a culet diameter of @xmath11 .",
    "resistance was measured in the crystalline @xmath12-plane by either the quantum design ppms or a lakeshore model 370 ac resistance bridge using the four - probe van der pauw method with currents of @xmath13 . in the high - field measurements ,",
    "the field was applied along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "gaskets were preindented from @xmath15 to @xmath16 thickness and were made of 316 stainless steel for the resistance measurements , and of a becu alloy for the ac susceptibility measurements .",
    "quasihydrostic soft , solid steatite was used as the pressure - transmitting medium for the resistance measurements , while a 1:1 mixture of n - pentane : isoamyl alcohol  @xcite was used for the ac susceptibility measurements .    for the ac susceptibility measurements , the superconducting transitions were determined inductively using a balanced primary / secondary coil system  @xcite located immediately outside the metal gasket and connected to a stanford research sr554 transformer pre - amplifier and a stanford research sr830 digital lock - in amplifier .",
    "the sample was subject to an ac magnetic field of @xmath17 rms applied along the @xmath14-axis with a frequency of @xmath18 .",
    "we have performed a calculation of the electronic structure using density - functional theory employing a plane - wave basis , the pbesol exchange - correlation functional  @xcite , and ultrasoft pseudo potentials  @xcite as implemented in the quantum espresso package  @xcite .",
    "the phonon dispersion and electron - phonon coupling were calculated using density - functional perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we use a plane - wave and charge cutoff of 42 and 168  ry , respectively , which ensures a total energy convergence of 1 mry / atom . for the electronic structure and phonon calculation",
    ", we sample the brillouin zone with a regular @xmath19 @xmath20-points mesh with a marzari - vanderbilt smearing  @xcite of 0.01  ry .",
    "this sampling yields total energy convergence of 1 mry / atom and for this smearing and matches the converged total energy of a higher sampling with lesser smearing .",
    "the structure was relaxed with a force and energy convergence of @xmath21  ry / a@xmath22 and @xmath23 ry respectively .",
    "for the phonon spectrum , we perform calculations for the structure at 25  gpa up to @xmath19 @xmath24-point meshes and determined that a @xmath25 mesh is sufficiently accurate .",
    "we calculate the phonon spectra at pressures of 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40  gpa using a @xmath25 sampling mesh . for the electron - phonon calculation",
    ", we have increased the brillouin sampling mesh to @xmath26 for the electronic wave function .",
    "the resulting electron phonon coupling is then averaged on the fermi surface using a metropolis algorithm with @xmath27 random @xmath20 points .",
    "the resulting eliashberg function was used to compute the logarithmic frequency @xmath28 and the effective electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath29",
    "@xmath2 was calculated from the mcmillan equation using these parameters together with a reasonable range for the effective coulomb interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_p ] shows a typical measurement of the electrical resistivity _",
    "vs_.  pressure at room temperature .",
    "the data were collected using a recently completed system that automatically calculates pressure from the fluorescence spectrum of the ruby in real time .",
    "this makes it possible to collect a great number of data points while the pressure is slowly swept upwards .",
    "this system will be detailed in a future publication .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig : r_p ] shows that at low pressures , the resistivity initially decreases , before passing through a minimum at about 5 gpa .",
    "this is near the pressure where bitei is thought to undergo a band inversion accompanied by a transition from trivial to topological insulator . at the critical pressure for the band inversion , @xmath30 ,",
    "a near linear dispersion is expected , which would lead to a minimum in the effective mass at @xmath30 .",
    "all other things being equal , the minimum in effective mass and closing of the band gap should result in a conductivity maximum ( resistivity minimum ) consistent with our data .    at higher pressures ,",
    "other features appear in the resistivity that are likely connected with structural transitions .",
    "the locations of the known structural transitions are indicated by vertical red lines . near the transition from bitei - i ( space group : @xmath5 ) to bitei - ii ( space group : @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the resistivity abruptly begins to increase before then decreasing in the bitei - iii structure ( space group : @xmath1 ) .",
    "these trends are consistent with previous electronic structure calculations  @xcite that predicted that ( 1 ) bitei - ii is a semiconductor with a larger band gap than bitei - i , and ( 2 ) bitei - iii is a metal .    the metallic nature of bitei - iii is further supported by the occurrence of superconductivity in this phase .",

    "though the @xmath2 of iodine never exceeds 1.2 k , bismuth has a @xmath2 of about @xmath33 at 20  gpa and tellurium has a @xmath2 of about @xmath34 at 35  gpa . in order to determine whether the observed superconductivity could be attributed to impurity phases",

    "the data clearly suggest that the superconductivity derives from bulk bitei , rather than any impurity phase .",
    "we also note that the slopes of @xmath38 for elemental bismuth and tellurium are roughly four and nine times larger , respectively , than we observe in the pressure range of interest , which provides further evidence against the possibility of impurity superconductivity .    ) and imaginary ( @xmath36 ) parts of the ac magnetic susceptibility _ vs. _ temperature for bitei at high pressure .",
    "the interval labeled `` full shielding '' at the right of the figure indicates the expected size of the transition for @xmath39 expulsion of flux from the sample .",
    "the results are thus consistent with bulk superconductivity in bitei at high pressures . ]    in order to further characterize the superconducting state in bitei , we carried out measurements in applied magnetic fields at a pressure of @xmath40 . in this particular experiment @xmath41 , which is somewhat lower than in our other experiments at similar pressures .",

    "although the exact values of @xmath2 vary somewhat from one measurement to the next , the overall trends are the same , and indeed the slopes , @xmath38 , are nearly identical .",
    "the scatter in the data might be due to the pressure conditions , which are only quasi - hydrostatic , and thus may vary somewhat from one experiment to the next .    during increasing pressure ,",
    "we have not observed superconductivity at pressures below @xmath50 ( see red data points , `` run 5 '' ) .",

    "much of the increase of the coupling from @xmath61 to @xmath54 gpa , and thus the increasing @xmath62 , has to be attributed to the increasing dos with lower pressure . from the band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dftbands ] , we attribute this to the additional predominantly te - like fermi surface that appears upon lowering the pressure . especially at high pressures",
    "we see a good agreement between experiment and theoretical calculations .",
    "also , we reproduce the observed trend to higher @xmath62 as we lower the pressure and approach the structural transition . since we find a rather large coupling constant , @xmath2 is not very sensitive to the coulomb repulsion parameter .",
    "the agreement between experiment and theory for the magnitude of @xmath2 and the observed increase in @xmath2 at lower pressure when bitei approaches the structural phase transition , demonstrates that the superconductivity bitei under pressure occurs by a conventional phonon mediated mechanism .",
    "it is interesting to compare the phase diagram of bitei to that previously reported for bitecl  @xcite .",
    "both compounds exhibit a very similar evolution under increasing pressure from a semiconducting structure , to an intermediate semiconducting structure with higher resistivity , and finally to a metallic structure . in the case of bitei",
    ", the evidence seems to suggests that the intermediate high resistivity phase ( bitei - ii ) is not superconducting .",
    "although superconductivity is sometimes observed in the pressure range assigned to bitei - ii , this only occurs after unloading from pressures high enough to enter the bitei - iii structure .",
    "thus , the superconductivity observed in the bitei - ii pressure range can likely be attributed to portions of the sample remaining in the phase iii high pressure structure .",
    "in contrast , in the case of bitecl , recent work shows superconductivity appearing in the intermediate , insulating , phase ii structure  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that , in the chloride , phase - ii is superconducting , while in the iodide , phase ii is non - superconducting .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that the critical pressures for the structural transitions are based primarily on room temperature data and that the phase boundaries could move as temperature is lowered .",
    "low temperature x - ray diffraction measurements on bitei and bitecl would be helpful in clarifying whether phase ii is superconducting in either compound .",
    "we have carried out a series of high pressure magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements on single crystals of bitei .",
    "these measurements show that the metallic high - pressure phase - iii of bitei ( space group : @xmath1 ) is a bulk superconductor .",
    "first principles electronic structure and phonon calculations are able to reproduce the approximate value of @xmath2 and trend of decreasing @xmath2 with increasing pressure , indicating that the superconductivity arises due to a conventional electron - phonon mechanism .",
