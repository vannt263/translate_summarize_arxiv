    "_ how chaotic can the lowest dimensional smooth invertible dynamical systems be ? _",
    "a circle diffeomorphism with irrational rotation number that preserves a smooth measure is smoothly conjugate to a rotation .",
    "it is hence rigid in the sense that the iterates along a subsequence of the integers converge uniformly to identity .",
    "rigidity implies the absence of mixing between any two measurable observables .",
    "this absence of mixing actually holds for all smooth circle diffeomorphisms with irrational rotation number since , by denjoy theory , they are topologically conjugated to rotations .",
    "circle diffeomorphisms with rational rotation number are even farther from mixing , since their non - wandering dynamics are supported on periodic points .",
    "the _ lowest dimensional setting _ that can be investigated after circle diffeomorphisms is that of smooth flows on surfaces preserving a smooth volume , that are often called multi - valued hamiltonian flows to emphasize their relation with solid state physics that was pointed out by novikov @xcite .",
    "the simplest setting to be examined is then that of smooth area - preserving flows without periodic orbits . on the two - dimensional torus",
    ", this setting is reduced to that of reparametrizations of minimal translation flows ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "kolmogorov showed that such flows are most probably conjugated to translation flows , since it suffices for this that the slope of the translation flow belongs to the full measure set of diophantine numbers @xcite .",
    "we remain in this case with the same spectral type as in the one - dimensional context .",
    "kolmogorov also observed that more exotic behaviors should be expected for the reparametrized flows in the case of liouville slopes .",
    "shklover indeed obtained in @xcite examples of real analytic reparametrizations of linear flows on the two - torus that were weak mixing ( continuous spectrum ) .",
    "subsequently , a.  katok showed that sufficiently smooth reparametrizations of linear flows on the torus are actually rigid  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the maximal spectral type of area - preserving flows of the torus without periodic orbits is always purely singular .",
    "kochergin @xcite extended the part of katok s results asserting absence of mixing to all surfaces and to lower regularity .",
    "all these results are obtained after the identification of regular reparametrizations of linear flows on @xmath0 with special flows above irrational rotations of the circle under regular ceiling functions ( see figure [ orbits ] and section [ sec.decay ] for the exact definition of a special flow ) .",
    "this identification follows from the existence of a global poincar section for the reparametrized flows .    as a consequence of katok s result , in order to go beyond the purely singular maximal spectral type for smooth area - preserving flows on the torus , one must allow the existence of singularities for the flow .",
    "our main result in this paper is the following    [ statement ] there exists a smooth area - preserving flow on @xmath0 with exactly one singularity , with lebesgue maximal spectral type .",
    "note that area - preserving flows on surfaces have topological entropy zero . and",
    "@xmath1 respectively  @xcite . ]",
    "their phase portrait is actually similar to that of a minimal translation flow , apart on one orbit that contains the saddle point which acts as a stopping point ( see figure [ kochergin ] ) .",
    "it is a striking fact that these quasi - minimal flows exhibit the same maximal spectral type as a bernoulli flow . to give a more detailed description of our result , we start by explaining how mixing appears for area - preserving surface flows .",
    "kochergin gave in @xcite the first examples of mixing area - preserving flows on surfaces .",
    "these were ergodic flows having at least one degenerate saddle .",
    "the examples we study here correspond to the case of the two - torus and a unique singularity ( see figure [ sym ] ) .    considering a section of the flow that is transversal to all orbits and does not contain the saddle , the dynamics can then be viewed as that of a special flow above an irrational rotation of the circle with a return time function ( called a _ ceiling _ or _ roof _",
    "function ) having a power - like singularity .",
    "the singularity is precisely the last point where the section intersects the incoming separatrix of the fixed point .",
    "the strength of the singularity depends on how abruptly the linear flow is slowed down in the neighborhood of the fixed point ( see remark [ rem.singularity ] ) .    in the case of other surfaces and several singularities ,",
    "the flows obtained by kochergin are equivalent to special flows above interval exchange transformations ( iet ) with ceiling functions having power - like singularities at the discontinuity points of the iet .",
    "the mechanism of mixing in kochergin examples is , in part , the same as in the weak mixing examples of shklover , namely the stretching of the birkhoff sums of the ceiling function above the iterates of the ergodic base dynamics .",
    "whenever these sums are uniformly stretched above small intervals , the image of small rectangles by the special flow for large times decomposes into long and thin strips ( see figure [ figflowmix ] ) .",
    "these strips are well distributed in the fibers due to uniform stretch , and well distributed in projection on the base because of ergodicity of the base dynamics .    however , the reason behind the uniform stretching is different for shklover s flows and kochergin s ones . for the first ones , uniform stretching of the birkhoff sums of the ceiling function is due to a liouville phenomenon of accumulation , along a subsequence of time , of the oscillations of the ceiling function due to periodic approximations . in the case of kochergin",
    "s flows , it is the shear between orbits as they get near the fixed points that is responsible for mixing . as a consequence , for the latter uniform stretching holds for _ all _ large times , while for the former , the existence of denjoy - koksma ( dk for short ) times impedes mixing .",
    "denjoy - koksma times are integers for which the birkhoff sums have an _ a priori _ bounded oscillation around the mean value on all or on a positive measure proportion of the base ( see for example the discussion around property dk in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , a key fact behind kochergin s result is that the denjoy - koksma property does not necessarily hold for ceiling functions having infinite asymptotic values at some singularities .",
    "a threshold is given by smooth ceiling functions having logarithmic singularities .",
    "when such a singularity is symmetric , it is known that for a typical irrational rotation a denjoy - koksma like property holds that prevents mixing of the special flow ( see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) ) .",
    "this is not true for asymmetric logarithmic singularities and we will now explain why . in @xcite , v.  arnold showed that multi - valued hamiltonian flows with non - degenerate saddle points have a phase portrait that decomposes into elliptic islands ( topological disks bounded by saddle connections and filled up by periodic orbits ) and one open uniquely ergodic component . on this component , the flow can be represented as the special flow over an interval exchange map of the circle and under a ceiling function that is smooth except for some logarithmic singularities .",
    "the singularities are typically asymmetric since the coefficient in front of the logarithm is twice as big on one side of the singularity as the one on the other side , due to the existence of homoclinic loops ( see figure [ figsaddle ] ) .",
    "arnold conjectured mixing on the open ergodic component for these flows and khanin and sinai proved it in the case of a circular rotation on the base under a certain restriction on the rotation angle  @xcite .",
    "kochergin @xcite later extended their result to all irrational angles .",
    "being , as we said , a basic model in low dimension dynamics , and being closely related to the theory of translation flows on higher genus surfaces and iet that was recently experiencing spectacular developments , multi - valued hamiltonian flows on surfaces attracted increasing interest in the last 20 years .",
    "the second author studied the deviations of ergodic averages for such flows  @xcite and proved a substantial part of the conjectures formulated by m.  kontsevich  @xcite and a.  zorich @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on their deviation spectrum .",
    "the proof of the kontsevich ",
    "zorich conjectures was later completed by a.  avila and m.  viana  @xcite .",
    "ergodic properties of multi - valued hamiltonian flows on higher genus surfaces with non - degenerate saddle singularities were studied by c.  ulcigrai who established that such flows are generically weak mixing  @xcite and not mixing @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently , j.  chaika and a.  wright @xcite gave mixing examples with finitely many non - degenerate fixed points and no saddle connections on a closed surface of genus @xmath2 ( the cancellations in the birkhoff sums of a symmetric log function above a circle rotation do not happen for all iet and this is why mixing is possible even without asymmetry in the ceiling function as in arnold examples ) .",
    "the first and third author of this paper established multiple mixing in many cases in the context of a single degenerate or non degenerate saddle @xcite .",
    "however not much was known , beyond weak mixing or mixing features , about the spectral properties of multi - valued hamiltonian flows on surfaces .",
    "the nature of the spectrum , be its multiplicity or its maximal spectral measure , remained quite obscure .",
    "the question of whether these flows may have an absolutely continuous spectrum was often raised ( see for example the related discussion in @xcite or @xcite ) in connection with the question whether there exist flows with simple lebesgue spectrum .",
    "this is the flow version of the famous banach s problem on the existence of a measure preserving transformation having simple lebesgue spectrum .",
    "we believe however that our examples most likely display a countable lebesgue spectrum .",
    "a positive answer to banach s problem in the flow context was given by a.  prikhodko @xcite .",
    "however , prikhodko s constructions are purely measurable while the examples presented in this paper include real analytic flows .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that kochergin flows with a sufficiently strong degenerate singularity typically have a lebesgue maximal spectral type .",
    "we now formulate our results more precisely .",
    "the flows which we will consider are special flows given by a base dynamics that is an irrational rotation by @xmath3 , and a ceiling function @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with the following properties : @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a small number , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "we refer to the beginning of section [ sec.decay ] for an exact definition of special flows .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 .",
    "we let @xmath13 and denote by @xmath14 the measure equal to the restriction to @xmath15 of the product of the haar measures @xmath16 on the circle @xmath17 and @xmath18 on the real line  @xmath19 .",
    "this measure is the unique invariant measure for the special flow @xmath20 given by @xmath21 .",
    "our main result is the following . for @xmath22",
    ", we will say that @xmath23 if and only if there exists a constant @xmath24 such that for any @xmath25 , @xmath26 it is a classical and easy to prove fact that for any @xmath22 , @xmath27 has full haar measure in @xmath17 .",
    "[ main ] for @xmath23 , @xmath28 , the dynamical system @xmath29 has lebesgue maximal spectral type .    [ rem.singularity ]    in @xcite , the following method is adopted to obtain area preserving flows on the torus with a degenerate saddle - node fixed point as in . consider first some hamiltonian flow on @xmath30 with the @xmath31axis invariant and with a unique singularity at the origin . in the neighborhood of the origin ,",
    "the orbits of such a flow are as described in figure [ kochergin ] .",
    "it is then possible to cut a small neighborhood of the origin and paste it smoothly inside the phase portrait of a linear flow of @xmath0 with any given slope . as a result ,",
    "one gets a multi - valued hamiltonian flow that has a unique singularity of saddle - node type .",
    "an easy calculation shows that if we consider the hamiltonian given by @xmath32 then the corresponding special flow has a unique symmetric power - like singularity as in  with @xmath9 arbitrarily close to @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "one can also obtain analytic examples with one fixed point as in . to do so , one starts with the smooth construction of a multi - valued hamiltonian described above .",
    "then , for an arbitrary @xmath35 , one considers a real analytic approximation of the smooth multi - valued hamiltonian that continues to have the same slope and a unique singularity at @xmath36 , with the same jets of order @xmath37 at @xmath36 ( that is , those of @xmath38 ) .",
    "from there it follows that the corresponding flow has a special flow representation with a ceiling function having a unique symmetric power - like singularity as in .    to prove the absolute continuity of the spectrum in theorem [ main ] it is natural to look for a control on the decay of correlations by the flow .    the only result in the direction of getting power - like estimates for the decay of correlations of surface flows was obtained in  @xcite , where the first author proved a polynomial bound @xmath39 on the decay of correlations ( as functions of time @xmath40 ) for kochergin flows with one power singularity and for the characteristic functions of rectangles .",
    "however , in that paper , @xmath41 , so it is not possible to deduce from the decay anything about the spectral type of the corresponding flow .",
    "however , and as it is often the case , characteristic functions of nice sets do not give the best rate of decay of correlations between observables .",
    "a better way of approaching the problem is through the choice of a different dense class of observables .",
    "such an approach was used by the second author and c.  ulcigrai in @xcite , where it is proved that smooth time changes of horocycle flows for compact hyperbolic surfaces have lebesgue maximal spectral type .",
    "the dense set of observables they considered was the set of smooth coboundaries for the reparametrized flow , that is , of coboundaries with smooth transfer function .",
    "we will also consider correlations between smooth coboundary functions and show that they are square summable .    for time - changes of horocycle flows ,",
    "the decay of correlations for coboundaries exploited in @xcite is based on the _ uniform shear _ of geodesic arcs , linear with respect to time , as in b.  marcus proof of mixing @xcite .",
    "such a shear can be readily derived from the commutation relations for the horocycle and the geodesic flows , and the unique ergodicity of the horocycle flow ( and hence of all of its time - changes ) , first established by h.  furstenberg @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in the case of",
    "suspension flows above rotations , there is no such fast mixing normalizing action as the geodesic flow , and the shear of horizontal arcs is provided by the stretching of the birkhoff sums of a roof function with a singularity ( see figure [ figflowmix ] ) .",
    "this _ non - uniform shear _ near the singularity , has a strength that depends on the asymptotics of the roof function at the singular point .",
    "it is crucial for our argument that the singularity be chosen strong enough so that , over most of the phase space , the inverse of the stretching is a square integrable function of time .",
    "this means that our power singularity must be chosen with exponent in the interval @xmath42 . for _ asymmetric",
    "power singularities , the set where the stretching of birkhoff sums is small , that is , not square - integrable , has small measure and can be neglected in the argument . however",
    ", such suspension flows can not be realized as smooth flows on a surface . for _ symmetric",
    "_ power singularities of exponent close to @xmath43 , which indeed can be realized as smooth flows ( see remark [ rem.singularity ] ) , the set of insufficient stretching is not negligible anymore , and we have to deal with it in the argument .",
    "this is a significant difficulty which , to the authors best knowledge , does not arise in any of the proofs of absolutely continuous spectrum available in the literature ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it is interesting to note that in our situation , in contrast with all the above - mentioned cases , in particular that of time - changes of horocycle flows investigated in @xcite , even for smooth coboundaries the correlation coefficients will not be of order at most @xmath44 for all times . to the contrary , along the subsequence @xmath45 given by the denominators of the irrational rotation , the correlation coefficients",
    "may in fact be as large as @xmath46 , for some @xmath47 , because there is a set of measure of order @xmath46 on which the flow at time @xmath45 is almost equal to the identity .",
    "this bad set appears due to the cancellations in the stretching of the birkhoff sums of the ceiling function that are caused by the symmetry at the singularity ( a remanant of the denjoy - koksma property ) .",
    "the bad set is essentially a union of thin towers that follow in projection the orbit of the translation on the base . outside the bad set",
    ", the correlations are well controlled due to sufficiently strong uniform stretching .",
    "a crucial part of our argument , completely absent in the earlier works mentioned above , deals precisely with the bad set .",
    "indeed , we use a bootstrap argument and the regular structure of the bad set , to show that for most of the times , that are in a medium scale neighborhood of the time @xmath45 , there is some decay of correlations on the bad set , that yields square summability of the total correlations ( see figures [ sym ] , [ wykres2 ] and [ wykres1 ] ) .",
    "the proof that the spectral type is not just absolutely continuous , but indeed equivalent to the lebesgue measure , is based on the construction of functions , localized on a thin strip around a long orbit segment , which have a given arbitrary correlation function on a finite , but arbitrarily long , time interval .",
    "the outline of the argument comes from the proof of the corresponding result for time changes of horocycle flows @xcite .",
    "however , again in contrast with the case of time - changes of horocycle flows , whose phase space has dimension @xmath1 , for this approach to work in the case of surface flows , that is , in dimension @xmath48 , it is crucial that the constant in the estimates on the square integrals of correlations satisfy good bounds in terms of the smooth norms of the functions .",
    "for this reason , we will estimate carefully this dependence throughout the paper .",
    "we end this introduction with some of the questions that naturally arise from our result .",
    "do kochergin flows always have the lebesgue maximal spectral type ?    to answer this question , one has to treat singularities with smaller powers as well as general iet on the base .",
    "what is the maximal spectral type in the case of non degenerate saddles ?",
    "arnold conjectured a power - like decay of correlation in the asymmetric case , but the decay is more likely to be logarithmic , at least between general regular observables or characteristic functions of regular sets such as balls or squares .",
    "even a lower bound on the decay of correlations is not sufficient to preclude absolute continuity of the maximal spectral type .",
    "however , an approach based on slowly coalescent periodic approximations as in  @xcite may be explored in the aim of proving that the spectrum is purely singular .",
    "* plan of the paper .",
    "*    in section [ sec.decay ] we first give the formal definition of our special flows and we describe the set of coboundary functions we will be interested in .    the proof that the flow @xmath49 has an absolutely continuous maximal spectral type follows by a standard argument from theorem [ cob ] that states that the fourier transforms of the spectral measures of functions in our special dense set are square - integrable .",
    "the proof of theorem [ cob ] splits in two parts .",
    "we consider a time @xmath50 $ ] for some @xmath51 .",
    "we further consider intervals of time of the type @xmath52\\subset [ q_n , q_{n+1}]$ ] .    first ,",

    "this is the content of proposition [ bn ] .",

    "this is the content of propositions [ prop.badset ] , [ good.dec ] and  [ pr1 ] .",
    "section [ sec.correlations ] explains the derivation of correlation decay estimates from uniform stretching of birkhoff sums .",
    "the main results of section [ sec.uniformstretchandcorrelations ] are corollary [ correlation.good ] that describes the fast decay of order at least @xmath53 on the good intervals that partition the complement of the bad set , and corollary [ alleb ] that describes the decay of order @xmath55 on general intervals ( with the bad set @xmath54 included ) .",
    "corollary [ correlation.good ] will directly yield the proof of proposition [ tdec ] on fast decay outside @xmath54 , given in section [ proof_tdec ] , while corollary [ alleb ] is crucial in the bootstrap argument that yields the averaged decay on the set @xmath54 of proposition [ bn ] , given in section [ proof_bn ] .",
