    "( it would be interesting to find this picture in his archives . )",
    "i still have the three pages of thin rice paper with the sakata model which he left with us .",
    "they correspond to his paper @xcite .",
    "these three pages were crucial for all my life in physics .",
    "sakata @xcite considered 7 mesons ( 3 @xmath0 , 4 @xmath1 ) and 8 baryons ( 2 @xmath2 , @xmath3 , 3 @xmath4 , 2  @xmath5 ) known at that time .",
    "he postulated that 3 baryons ",
    "@xmath6  are more fundamental than the other 5 baryons and 7 mesons and demonstrated that these 12 particles could be composed from @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the paper had a philosophical flavor and contained no experimental predictions . in 1956",
    "particle physicists were discussing the @xmath8-puzzle and parity violation ( see reference @xcite for further details ) .",
    "therefore the paper @xcite as well as three accompanying papers of sakata s students @xcite had no immediate response .",
    "( s.  tanaka @xcite discussed @xmath8-parity degeneracy in the sakata model , z.  maki @xcite attempted to calculate bound states of baryons and antibaryons , while k.  matumoto @xcite suggested a semi - empirical formula for masses of composite particles . )",
    "in the summer of 1957 i suddenly `` reinvented '' the sakata model and realized its beauty and its potential .",
    "then i recalled the three rice pages and reread them .",
    "my first paper @xcite on the sakata model was presented by i.i .",
    "gurevich at the conference in padua ",
    "venice , september 1957 .",
    "a slightly different text @xcite was published in a russian journal . in these publications the three `` sakatons '' were not physical @xmath9 , but some primary particles denoted by the same letters , so `` we can assume that for the primary particles @xmath10 '' @xcite .",
    "strong and weak interactions of sakatons were considered and for the latter a number of selection rules were deduced , in particular , those which are known as @xmath11 , @xmath12 for nonleptonic decays of strange particles via the @xmath13 transition , while for the leptonic ( or semi - leptonic ) ones @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 via @xmath15 current .    as for the strong interactions ,",
    "the existence of @xmath16- and @xmath17-mesons was predicted in @xcite ; i denoted them @xmath18 and @xmath19 :     in the framework of this scheme there is a possibility of two additional neutral mesons which have not so far been observed : @xmath20    the isotopic spin of the @xmath21-mesons is zero . ",
    "@xcite    ( the unconventional minus sign in the definition of @xmath19 was in accord with the not less unconventional definition @xmath22 . )",
    "in december 1957 four soviet particle physicists ( d.i .",
    "blokhintsev , v.p .",
    "dzhelepov , s.ya .",
    "nikitin and myself ) visited palo alto , berkeley , boston , new york , brookhaven . for me",
    "it was my first trip abroad and the first flight in my life .",
    "( the next time the soviet authorities allowed me to visit the usa was only in 1988 for the neutrino88 conference . )    during the 1957 trip i talked with m.  baker , h.  bethe , s.  drell , r.  feynman , r.  gatto , m.  gell - mann , s.  goldhaber , c.  sommerfield , f.  zachariasen , c.  zemach and many others , gave a seminar at berkeley . as a result of this seminar e.  segre invited me to write an article for the annual review of nuclear science .",
    "it appeared in 1959 ( see below ) .",
    "my second paper on the sakata model `` mass reversal and compound model of elementary particles '' was published in june 1958 as a dubna preprint @xcite and i had it with me at the 1958 rochester conference at cern .",
    "on the initiative of j.r .",
    "oppenheimer and r.e .",
    "marshak a special seminar was arranged at which i presented my paper at the start of the conference and then was asked to present it also at session 7 , `` special theoretical topics '' , see @xcite .",
    "( note that selection rules for weak interactions in sections 14 , 15 and references 24 - 28 of the dubna preprint @xcite were deleted by the editors of the proceedings @xcite ; see the appendix for the deleted pages . )    in @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 became mixtures of the states discussed above .",
    "what is more important , all interactions were assumed to be @xmath23-invariant following papers @xcite and especially @xcite .",
    "the conservation of the vector non - strange current , postulated in @xcite , was shown in @xcite to be inevitable in the sakata model .",
    "unfortunately the strong interaction was written as an ugly four - fermion interaction of sakatons .",
    "the discussion of my talk involved r.  gatto , g.  lders , r.  adair , g.  wentzel , t.d .",
    "lee , y.  yamaguchi ( see page 228 of the proceedings ) . the discussion with yoshio yamaguchi continued during the lunch in the cern canteen . in the afternoon of the same day",
    "j.  oppenheimer commented my argument that in the sakata model conservation of the weak non - strange vector current is inevitable ( see page 257 ) .",
    "he again at length commented the subject in his `` concluding remarks '' at the conference ( see page 293 ) .",
    "r.  marshak stressed the novelty of chiral invariance for strong interactions ( see page 257 ) . in his talk `` @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays and related subjects ''",
    "marshak repeatedly underlined that for these decays `` @xmath26 in okun s model '' ( see @xcite , pp . 284 , 285 ) .    in the discussion @xcite i described an upper limit on @xmath27 transitions which had been derived by b.  pontecorvo and myself @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the selection rules for weak interactions which follow from the sakata model the lifetime of @xmath28 and its branching ratios were predicted @xcite by i.yu .",
    "kobzarev and myself .",
    "this prediction was cited by me in december 1957 at stanford and as reference [ 28 ] in the dubna preprint @xcite and was soon confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "in 1959 my paper @xcite appeared as well as its russian twin @xcite .",
    "i received a hundred requests for reprints , many of them  from japan .",
    "strangely enough , rereading now this paper , i do not see in it the prediction of @xmath16 and @xmath17 and any statement that @xmath6 are not physical baryons , but some more fundamental particles . both the prediction and the statement were in @xcite .",
    "i can not understand now their irrational omission in @xcite .    in 1959",
    "other authors started to publish papers on the sakata model .",
    "a.  gamba , r.  marshak and s.  okubo @xcite pointed out the symmetry between the three leptons ( @xmath29 ) and three baryons ( @xmath30 ) `` in models of sakata @xcite and okun @xcite '' .",
    "this symmetry has been emphasized by marshak ( in his rapporteur talk @xcite at the 1959 rochester conference in kiev ) and became known as the kiev symmetry .",
    "( i served as a scientific secretary of r.  marshak and participated in preparation of his report . )    at the kiev conference m.  gell - mann told me : `` if i were you , i would introduce in the @xmath31 model the linear superposition ( @xmath32 ) '' .",
    "i do not understand why i did not follow his advice .",
    "the angle @xmath33 is known now as the cabibbo angle .",
    "the weak current @xmath34 first appeared next year in the paper by m.  gell - mann and m.  levy @xcite .    in 1959",
    "the symmetry which is now called su(3 ) was introduced into sakata model .",
    "y.  yamaguchi @xcite with reference to @xcite stressed the existence of 9 pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "o.  klein @xcite and s.  ogawa @xcite discussed generalizations of isotopic symmetry .",
    "in particular , s.  ogawa with reference to @xcite considered 3 doublets @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and 3 meson triplets .",
    "m.  ikeda , s.  ogawa , y.  ohnuki @xcite with reference to @xcite developed some mathematical constructs of the symmetry to which they referred as u(3 ) .",
    "o. klein @xcite discussed the interaction between the triplet of sakatons and the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and stressed the symmetry between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in 1960 i was invited to give a rapporteur talk at the rochester conference in rochester .",
    "i prepared the draft of the talk , but was not allowed by soviet authorities to attend the conference .",
    "my draft @xcite based on the sakata model has been prepared for the proceedings by s.  weinberg .",
    "goldberger who `` was thrown into a breach at a rather late date '' served as a rapporteur on `` weak interactions ( theoretical ) '' @xcite referred to my draft .",
    "r.  feynman @xcite spoke on the conserved vector current .",
    "he said that in the model of fermi and yang `` as has been pointed out in much more detail by okun , in any complex structure , the coupling of the beta decay is proportional to the total isotopic spin '' .",
    "m.  gell - mann @xcite spoke on the conserved and partially conserved currents .",
    "he said : `` ... there is the scheme mentioned by feynman and favored by okun , marshak , and others , based on just @xmath41 , and @xmath3 . of course , if that is right we do not need the elaborate machinery i just described .",
    "we simply draw an analogy '' .",
    "but as it is clear from their talks both feynman and gell - mann at that time preferred to use the composite model only as a tool to formulate more general phenomenological approaches . among the talks at rochester 1960 was that by y.  ohnuki @xcite who with a reference to @xcite assumed @xmath42 and the three - dimensional unitary symmetry .",
    "an important paper of 1960 was that by j.  sakurai @xcite .",
    "with a reference to @xcite he mentioned that instead of @xmath43 one can use as `` elementary '' @xmath44 .",
    "he considered the absence of @xmath16-meson as a serious problem : `` ... within the framework of fermi  yang  sakata  okun model it may be difficult to explain why the @xmath16 does not exist '' ( see pp .",
    "32 - 36 ) .    the @xmath16-meson was discovered within a year @xcite .",
    "further progress in su(3 ) symmetric sakata model was achieved by m.  ikeda , y.  miyachi , s.  ogawa @xcite , who applied this symmetry to weak decays .",
    "z.  maki , m.  nakagava , y.  ohnuki , s.  sakata published a paper on sakata model @xcite .",
    "they wrote : `` ... it has recently become clear that feynman  gell - mann current derived from the sakata model is quite sufficient to account for the experimental facts concerning the weak processes @xcite '' .",
    "they postulated the existence of a so - called @xmath45 matter .",
    "the bound state @xmath46 had been identified with @xmath47 , bound state @xmath48  with @xmath3 , while @xmath49  with @xmath50 .    in 196061",
    "i was giving lectures @xcite based on the sakata model .",
    "subsequently they were recast into the book @xcite .",
    "my major mistake at that time was that i did not consider seriously eight spin 1/2 baryons as an su(3 ) octet in spite of the `` eightfold way '' papers by m.  gell - mann @xcite and y.   neeman @xcite .",
    "( the former referred to papers @xcite . )",
    "in 1962 the sakata model was `` falsified '' for a short time by experiments @xcite , which discovered decays @xmath51 and @xmath52 forbidden by @xmath53 rule . at the 1962 geneva conference i tried to find a mistake in the results @xcite but failed .",
    "pomeranchuk who witnessed the argument commented later that my `` feathers were flying '' .",
    "i do not remember now how the mistake was found subsequently by experimentalists .",
    "maybe it was a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the authors of articles @xcite referred to the paper by feynman and gell - mann @xcite . while in my papers @xcite",
    "the forbidden decays were simply listed , in @xcite the notations @xmath54 and @xmath55 were used and the currents with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59-currents ) were phenomenologically considered on the same footing .",
    "the product of these currents gives transitions with @xmath60 .",
    "the limit on these transitions from the absence of decays @xmath61 was not reliable because `` so few @xmath5 particles have been seen that this is not really conclusive''@xcite .",
    "( the paper @xcite ( published in june 1957 ) had put a much better limit on @xmath60 processes from @xmath62 transitions .",
    "but it was not known to feynman and gell - mann when they wrote @xcite . )    in 1962 m.  gell - mann predicted the existence of @xmath63-hyperon @xcite .",
    "i.  kobzarev and myself @xcite derived the su(3 ) relations between semileptonic decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1-mesons .",
    "together with relations for the decays of baryons they were later derived by n.  cabibbo @xcite .",
    "the discovery of @xmath64 prompted attempts to reconcile the existence of two neutrinos with the lepton - sakaton symmetry . in order to preserve the kiev symmetry z.  maki , m.  makagawa , s.  sakata @xcite modified the @xmath45 matter model @xcite .",
    "they assumed that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is one of the two orthogonal superpositions of @xmath67 and @xmath64 .",
    "the other superposition @xmath68 was assumed either not to form at all a bound state with @xmath45 or to form a baryon with a very large mass . on the basis of this model the paper introduced @xmath69 oscillations .",
    "another way to lepton - sakaton symmetry was suggested in the paper by y.  katayama , k.  motumoto , s.  tanaka , e.  yamada @xcite , where the fourth sakaton was explicitly introduced .",
    "in 1964 @xmath17-meson and @xmath63-hyperon were discovered @xcite .",
    "earlier this year g.  zweig @xcite and m. gell - mann @xcite replaced the integer charged sakatons by fractionally charged particles ( aces  zweig ; quarks  gell - mann ) .",
    "this allowed them to construct not only the octet and singlet of mesons , but also the octet and decuplet of baryons . when establishing the electromagnetic and weak currents in the quark model m.  gell - mann @xcite referred to similar expressions in the sakata model .",
    "on november 3 2006 i received the following email from a colleague and a friend of mine ",
    "valentine i. zakharov :     dear lev borisovich ,    i am now visiting kanazawa , japan . this month , there will be a one - day conference in nagoya , to celebrate 50 years of the sakata model .",
    "they invited me to come and i eagerly agreed .",
    "one of the reasons  which you can readily guess was that the words ` sakata model ' were among the first ones i heard about our field .",
    "( you were giving lectures to ` experimentalists ' , with alikhanov in the first row ; ( m.i .",
    "ryazanov from mephi encouraged me to attend ; it was some time before i showed up later ) .",
    "i will mention of course that you were developing the sakata model at itep .",
    "but , unfortunately , i realized that i do not know anything else , to any extent personal about sakata - sensei .",
    "i mean , no other papers , or their echo in russia / ussr , nothing ... may be you can help in some way ?",
    "excuse me , please , for bothering you and with best regards , valya  .",
