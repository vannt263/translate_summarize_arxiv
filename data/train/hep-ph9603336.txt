    "one of the successes of the supersymmetric version of the standard model is that it provides a natural candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe .",
    "many authors  @xcite have lauded this feature of supersymmetry .",
    "studies often assume that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the bino ( @xmath5 ) , the supersymmetric partner of the hypercharge gauge boson , for two reasons .",
    "bino annihilation can give about the right relic density .",
    "second , minimal supergravity models with gauge coupling unification and with universal scalar and gaugino masses at the unification scale generically produce a bino lsp after the full renormalization group flow of all sparticle masses , yukawas , and gauge couplings  @xcite . in general , higgsino - like lsp",
    "s annihilate too efficiently to provide cosmologically interesting amounts of cold dark matter .    in this paper",
    "we are instead motivated primarily by data rather than by general theory , mainly by the @xmath0 event reported by cdf  @xcite .",
    "this event has two different possible supersymmetric interpretations .",
    "one  @xcite is that two selectrons are created which ultimately decay into electrons , photons , and a very light gravitino ( less than about @xmath6 ) as would happen in low scale gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "however , these models have not as yet produced a compelling cold dark matter candidate , and so we do not consider the light gravitino interpretation further for this paper .",
    "the second supersymmetric interpretation of this event  @xcite is based on ordinary gravity communicated supersymmetry breaking where the gravitino is sufficiently heavy to not be the lsp . in this interpretation , the decay chain which produces",
    "@xmath0 is e^+ e^- e^+ n_2 e^- n_2 e^+e^- where the photino - like second - lightest neutralino @xmath7 decays radiatively  @xcite into the lightest neutralino ( @xmath8 ) and a photon .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is the lsp .",
    "here , motivated by the desire for a simple notation ( and one suitable for e - mail ) we denote neutralinos by @xmath9 ( and charginos by @xmath10 ) .",
    "if the supersymmetric interpretation of the fnal @xmath11 event is correct , then @xmath8 has been observed at fnal . of course , that it escapes the detector only proves it lives longer than @xmath12 sec , so its direct detection would be necessary before it could be finally accepted as the cold dark matter .",
    "in this paper we will demonstrate that @xmath8 can be an interesting dark matter candidate , despite the fact that it is higgsino - like , and we also discuss the direct detection prospects for such a particle .",
    "our analysis assumes a general low scale supersymmetric lagrangian , with no presumed relations among parameters .",
    "no assumptions are made about the exact form of the high scale theory except that it exists perturbatively , and no assumptions are made about common gaugino or scalar masses .",
    "rather , we assume that the low energy theory can be described by a superpotential plus general soft - breaking terms .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the mass and coupling requirements of the light supersymmetric states .",
    "in order to proceed with a discussion about the dark matter qualities of the @xmath8 lsp , we must discuss its composition and mass . for convention purposes we write down the neutralino mass matrix @xmath13 in the @xmath14 basis .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 is near one , then the two lightest eigenstates of the neutralino mass matrix are @xmath17 ( photino - like ) , and @xmath18 ( higgsino - like ) , where @xmath19 .",
    "this arrangement of lightest neutralino mass eigenstates enhances the important radiative neutralino decay @xmath20 , and along with the @xmath21 event of ref .",
    "@xcite implies @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "we shall see that with @xmath16 near one the @xmath24 invisible width constraint is satisfied and @xmath8 provides an interesting amount of dark matter as well .    from the invisible width determinations at lep , the @xmath24 is not allowed to decay into @xmath25 with a partial width more than about 5 mev ( at @xmath26 )  @xcite . in our approximation ,",
    "the formula for the partial width is @xmath27 figure  [ inv : fig ] has contours of the invisible width in units of mev .",
    "= 3.25 in    as can be seen from the above equation as long as @xmath16 is close enough to 1 then the invisible width constraint can be satisfied .",
    "we think this constraint should not be applied too tightly at this stage since it could be affected by new physics . however , since @xmath28 is the natural region for the radiative decay requirements in ref .",
    "@xcite , this constraint does not cause any problems for our analysis here , even if it is applied with the most stringent assumptions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 pairs annihilate through the @xmath24 into fermion pairs .",
    "to look at the prediction for @xmath29 , we can expand the thermally averaged annihilation cross section  @xcite into fermions @xmath30 in the following way : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend only on one unknown , the lsp mass . applying the usual approximation method  @xcite to solve the boltzmann equation ,",
    "the relic abundance can be found : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 must be solved for self - consistently .",
    "calculations such as these could be valid to a factor of two or better .    in fig .",
    "[ omega : fig ] contours of @xmath29 are plotted in the @xmath38 plane .",
    "= 3.25 in    since the annihilation cross section is proportional to @xmath39 when @xmath16 gets closer to 1 , @xmath29 begins to exceed one .",
    "the @xmath40 channel sfermion exchange is greatly suppressed ( since @xmath8 is mainly higgsino - like ) , but if the @xmath41 fraction of @xmath8 is large enough , then a @xmath40 channel sfermion diagram which couples like the @xmath42 gauge coupling could start to become important .",
    "however , this potentially efficient annihilation channel is suppressed by a factor of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is less than about @xmath45  @xcite . comparing @xmath46 with @xmath47",
    ", we find that this channel can compete with the @xmath48 channel @xmath24 exchange only when @xmath16 is less than about @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath16 gets closer and closer to 1 , @xmath44 necessarily becomes smaller and smaller , and the number @xmath50 is actually an overestimate . at @xmath51",
    "we find that the annihilation cross section is too small for all values of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ omega : fig ] , and therefore we set this as our lower bound on allowed @xmath16 in this scenario .",
    "consequently , the sfermion annihilation channel is not numerically important .",
    "the @xmath48 channel higgs exchange diagrams might possibly play an important role in the annihilation cross section . however , if the pseudo - scalar ( @xmath53 ) is sufficiently heavy then the pseudo - scalar and heavy scalar ( @xmath54 ) higgses will decouple ; in the absence of information about the heavy higgs bosons we assume they effectively decouple . in this limit it can be shown that the @xmath55 also vertex decouples . furthermore , since the lsp is sufficiently light not to annihilate into top quarks , or vector bosons , the light final state fermion masses contribute a further suppression of the @xmath56 mediated annihilation cross section .    the allowed mass range for @xmath8 from ref .",
    "@xcite overlaps @xmath57 if consistency with the supersymmetry interpretation of the lep @xmath58 excess is required , probably @xmath59 , but it is premature to assume that . if @xmath60 it is necessary to do the resonant calculation very carefully  @xcite .",
    "there is always a value of @xmath16 for which the curves of fig .",
    "2 continue across @xmath61 smoothly , so we will wait until @xmath52 and @xmath16 are better measured to do the more precise calculations needed .",
    "we show results in fig .",
    "2 for @xmath62 which we expect is the most relevant region .",
    "given the results of reference  @xcite , the only channel that could complicate the simple analysis is coannihilation of the @xmath8 with the @xmath63  @xcite , if @xmath64 ( @xmath63 is the lightest stop mass eigenstate ) .",
    "we expect @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so probably this complication can be ignored , but until the masses are better determined it should be kept in mind .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath67 is probably between about @xmath68 and @xmath69 . assuming the cold dark matter constitutes 0.4 to 0.8 of @xmath70",
    ", we expect that @xmath71 should lie somewhere between @xmath72 and @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ omega : fig ] ( e.g. @xmath73 ) .",
    "we emphasize that fig .",
    "2 follows from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , and that apart from the approximations mentioned above this is a prediction of the supersymmetric interpretation of the cdf event .",
    "further , we note that the supersymmetric interpretation of the reported excess of @xmath74 decays at lep leads to the same region of parameters as ref .",
    "@xcite , with higgsino - like @xmath8 and with @xmath16 near 1  @xcite , and therefore can conservatively be viewed as consistent with this prediction , or optimistically as additional evidence for its correctness .",
    "we have established that the same @xmath8 which is necessary to explain the @xmath0 event at fermilab , and independently the lep @xmath75 excess , is also a viable cold dark matter candidate .",
    "future experiments at fermilab and lep will be able to determine if the supersymmetric interpretation of the cdf event is a valid one .",
    "however , these colliders can not determine experimentally if @xmath8 particles in fact are stable and comprise a significant portion of the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "in this section we discuss some of the direct detection prospects for this particle .    from kinematic analyses of the galactic rotation curves",
    "it has been estimated  @xcite that the local density of cold dark matter is approximately @xmath76 .",
    "( we will use the lower number in our subsequent calculations . ) several experiments are under way to look for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) floating around our part of the galaxy .",
    "neutrino telescopes at amanda , etc . , hope to see the effects of wimp annihilations in the sun .",
    "the light higgsino dark matter candidate , which we propose here , would be difficult to detect at the large area neutrino telescopes since the muon threshold energy is about @xmath77 , roughly equivalent to the lsp mass range we are considering . the neutrinos produced by the lsp annihilations in the sun will be at energies below this threshold , and so the converted muons will not be energetic enough to be detected .",
    "other experiments  @xcite are designed to measure direct annihilations of lsps in the galactic halo by seeing an excess of photons , electrons , protons , etc .  in the spectrum .",
    "the steeply rising photon background ( as energy decreases ) makes the photon signal difficult to extract , and the broad energy spread of the electron / positron signal for @xmath78 annihilations in the galactic halo also complicates this detection possibility .",
    "lastly , numerous table - top experiments  @xcite are being set up with the hope of seeing wimps interact with different nuclei .",
    "it is this last set of experiments that we wish to focus on in this analysis .",
    "we also wish to urge one change in notation , namely that the acronym wisp ( weakly interacting supersymmetric particle ) be used when the particle in question is known to be a possible state following from a supersymmetric lagrangian and consistent with phenomenological constraints ; many wimp s discussed in the literature are not wisp s .",
    "since we have argued that the @xmath24 coupling is the most important one , we concentrate on @xmath79 and @xmath80 which are well - suited for spin - dependent scattering of lsp s with nucleons , and are currently being considered by experimentalists for larger scale designs .",
    "the spin - dependent cross section in this scenario can be written as @xmath81 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the spin content of the neutron  @xcite carried by quark @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the mass of a silicon atom . from this",
    "we can estimate  @xcite the rate of interactions per day : @xmath85 where @xmath86 quantifies the nuclear form factor suppression .",
    "we are not considering the spin - independent cross section in this analysis since , as we argued above , the couplings of @xmath87 to all scalar particles are very small .",
    "it is possible with a lighter pseudo - scalar mass to have larger couplings of @xmath87 to the higgs particles , which would contribute to a spin - independent cross - section , but to be conservative we have assumed that the higgs effects are decoupled .",
    "figure  [ si29:fig ] is a plot of the event rate per kilogram per day of @xmath8 interacting on @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "= 3.25 in    the expected sensitivity  @xcite for @xmath80 is at about the @xmath88 events contour in the near future , and about @xmath89 in the next round of experiments .",
    "thus , the entire region of the plot above about the @xmath89 event contour will soon be probed in the table - top detector .",
    "this is a good demonstration of how the table top experiment can sometimes do better than collider limits ( see fig .",
    "[ inv : fig ] ) for an interesting part of parameter space .",
    "@xmath90ge has a reduced event rate compared to silicon mainly because the nuclear land @xmath91 factor is smaller , and the nucleus mass is heavier .",
    "we interpret fig .",
    "[ si29:fig ] as implying that si and ge and related detectors may be able to observe a cold dark matter signal in the next round of attempts .",
    "it is remarkable that these calculations ( which could have given much smaller or much larger @xmath92 and are essentially free of parameters ) imply a wisp cold dark matter candidate that is cosmologically interesting , possibly detectable using table - top experiments , possibly already observed at fnal , and possibly associated with loop effects seen at lep .",
