    "one of the major uncertainties in modern astrophysics is the issue of whether the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is universal or , alternatively , determined by environmental effects .",
    "galactic globular clusters and rich , compact magellanic cloud star clusters are ideal laboratories for providing strong constraints on the universality of the imf , in particular because they are essentially single age , single metallicity systems for which statistically significant samples of individual stars over a range of masses can easily be resolved .    although the standard picture , in which stars in dense clusters evolve rapidly towards a state of energy equipartition through stellar encounters  with the corresponding mass segregation  is generally accepted , observations of various degrees of mass segregation in very young star clusters ( e.g. , de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b and references therein ) suggest that at least some of this effect is related to the process of star and star cluster formation itself .",
    "quantifying the degree of actual mass segregation is thus crucial for the interpretation of observational luminosity and mass functions ( lfs / mfs ) in terms of the imf , even for very young star clusters .",
    "therefore , we obtained f555w and f814w _ hubble space telescope / wfpc2 _ imaging observations of two young compact lmc clusters , ngc 1805 ( @xmath0 myr ) and ngc 1818 ( @xmath1 myr ) , covering a large range of radii ( see de grijs et al .",
    "2002a for observational details ) .",
    "the radial dependence of the lf and mf slopes indicate clear mass segregation in both clusters at radii @xmath2 ( de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b ) . within the uncertainties",
    ", we can not claim that the slopes of the outer mfs in ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 are significantly different , which therefore implies that these clusters must have had very similar imfs .    in fig .",
    "1a we show the dependence of the cluster core radius on the adopted magnitude ( mass ) range . for both clusters",
    "we clearly detect the effects of mass segregation for stars with masses @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is also clear that stars with masses @xmath5 show a similar concentration , while a trend of increasing core radius with decreasing mass ( increasing magnitude ) is apparent for lower masses .",
    "we estimate that the ngc 1818 cluster core is between @xmath6 crossing times old , so that dynamical mass segregation in its core should be well under way . by applying scaling laws to ngc 1805 ,",
    "we conclude that its core is likely @xmath7 crossing times old .",
    "however , since strong mass segregation is observed out to @xmath8 and @xmath9 in ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 , respectively , for stellar masses in excess of @xmath10 , it is most likely that significant primordial mass segregation was present in both clusters , particularly in ngc 1805 ( cf ."
