    "regions interior to the solar circle represent a harsh environment to the long - term survival of open clusters ( ocs ) . the low - mass ones in particular ,",
    "dissolve into the field in less than @xmath11gyr ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical and n - body predictions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , coupled to observational evidence ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) consistently indicate that the disruption - time scale ( ) near the solar circle is shorter than @xmath12gyr and depends on cluster mass as @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath14 should be expected for clusters with an initial mass within @xmath15 .",
    "besides , disruption processes are more effective for the more centrally located and lower - mass ocs ( see @xcite for a review on these effects ) .",
    "it is in this context that the discovery and characterisation of new ocs towards the inner galactic regions play an important role .",
    "here we establish the nature and derive astrophysical parameters of the poorly - studied , faint ocs teutsch145 and 146 . both clusters were discovered by phillip teutsch in a systematic survey of several milky way fields near the galactic plane using red , blue , and infrared first and second generation dss images downloaded from the eso online digitized sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are dealing with @xmath16 galactic quadrant clusters , which makes them particularly suitable to explore dynamical cluster properties within the solar circle .",
    "algorithms designed to deal with field - star contamination in densely populated fields , together with other tools to study colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and stellar radial density profiles ( rdps ) have been developed by our group in previous 2mass studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the near future ,",
    "vista together with other surveys with large telescopes , will deepen by about 4 magnitudes the presently - available near infrared photometry in a large area throughout the galactic plane .",
    "the new - and deeper - photometry will probably require specific algorithms to be analysed .",
    "thus , besides the more direct goal of deriving parameters of two interesting objects , in the present work we apply our analytical tools to the optical data of the two faint open clusters , teutsch145 and 146 , obtained with the 3.58 m galileo telescope ( tng ) .    since they are located in the @xmath16 quadrant ( with the associated enhanced disruption rates )",
    ", the heavy field contamination should be properly taken into account for the intrinsic properties to be assessed . in this context ,",
    "our main goal in this work is to determine whether such clusters can be characterised as typical ocs or if they present signs of dissolution .",
    "in addition , we will derive their fundamental and structural parameters , most of these for the first time .",
    ".position and angular size [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table notes .",
    "col .  5 : arcmin to parsec scale .    to derive cluster structural parameters",
    ", we fit the rdps with the analytical function @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the residual background density , @xmath19 is the central density of stars , and  is the core radius .",
    "formally , it is similar to the @xcite function that describes the surface - brightness profiles in the central parts of gcs .",
    "however , in the present cases it is applied to star counts , with equivalent results ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given the limited radial range of the rdps , the background level is little constrained and thus , its fit value has large error bars . besides",
    ", the actual cluster size can not be precisely determined .",
    "the central regions , on the other hand , are well sampled . with the above restrictions in mind , the best - fit solutions ( together with the uncertainties )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , and the parameters are given in table  [ tab2 ] .    within uncertainties ,",
    "the adopted king - like function describes both rdps along most of the detected radius range .",
    "however , the innermost bin ( @xmath20 ) presents a significant excess over the fit in both cases .",
    "such a cusp has been attributed to a post - core collapse structure in old star clusters , like those detected in some gcs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gyr - old ocs , e.g. ngc3960 ( @xcite ) and lk10 ( @xcite ) , also present this dynamical evolution - related feature .",
    "thus , the presence of such features in clusters a few @xmath0yrs old located in the inner galaxy ( sect .",
    "[ dfp ] ) is not unusual .",
    "based on the extrapolation of the king - like fit into the background ( taking into account the respective uncertainties ) , we estimate that the cluster radius of teutsch145 is about @xmath21pc ) . for teutsch146",
    "we estimate the somewhat larger value @xmath22pc ) .",
    "compared to the core radii derived for a sample of relatively nearby ocs by @xcite , the king - like values of the present ocs ( @xmath23 ) fall around the mean value of that distribution .",
    "however , these values should be taken only as representative , since the inner region of both ocs clearly does not follow the king - like profile .",
    "about 5 mags of the field - decontaminated ms ( together with a few giants ) of teutsch145 and 146 are detected by the galileo photometry ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] ) , which can be used to build the mass function @xmath24 and estimate the mass stored in stars .",
    "the decontamination algorithm excludes stars in integer numbers from the cmds , and thus , it should be used essentially to determine the intrinsic cmd morphology .",
    "however , when magnitude ( or mass ) bins are considered , the bin - to - bin subtraction of the comparison field contribution ( normalised to the same projected areas ) is expected to produce fractional numbers , which should be taken into account by , e.g. the mfs or the cluster mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the following analyses are based on colour - magnitude filtered photometry ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .    for the present purposes we consider the regions within @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) , respectively for teutsch145 and 146 , which correspond to @xmath27pc in both cases .",
    "the effective ms stellar mass ranges are @xmath28 ( teutsch145 ) and @xmath29 .",
    "( teutsch146 ) .",
    "the number of member ms and giant stars is derived by counting the stars ( in bins of @xmath30mag ) , and subtracting those in the field ( normalised to the same area ) .",
    "the corresponding stellar mass in each magnitude bin is taken from the mass - luminosity relation derived from the isochrone fits ( sect .",
    "[ dfp ] ) .",
    "we found @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively for the ms and giant stars of teutsch145 , and the similar values @xmath33 and @xmath34 for teutsch146 .",
    "thus , the respective total stellar mass values inferred within the spatial region considered are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    with the above data we build the mf for the mss ( figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "both mfs are well represented by the function @xmath37 , with the slope @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively for teutsch145 and 146 .",
    "these values agree with the @xmath40 of @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this is not a surprising result , since recent works raise the possibility of a universal initial mass function that , for the mass range @xmath9 , is essentially salpeter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "besides , salpeter - like slopes also occur ( for @xmath9 ) in a variety of ocs younger than about 1gyr ( e.g. fig .  12 in @xcite for the near - infrared , and @xcite in the optical )",
    ".    finally , we estimate the total stellar mass ( within @xmath27pc ) by extrapolating the observed mfs down to the h - burning mass limit ( @xmath41 ) . we assume the universal imf of @xcite , which is characterised by the slopes @xmath42 for the range @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain @xmath46 in both cases , a value somewhat higher than the mean cluster mass with respect to the nearby oc distribution of @xcite . for these values , the mass to light ratios are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively for teutsch145 and 146 , consistent with their ages ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the above mass values should be taken as lower limits , since the clusters are larger than the region ( @xmath27pc ) within which the mass functions were computed .",
    "besides , given the restricted spatial range of the observations , the comparison fields are located at the outskirts of the clusters themselves , and thus , an oversubtraction of member stars ( mostly low - mass stars ) certainly occurred .",
    "the positions of teutsch145 and 146 , projected onto the galactic plane , are given in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , which shows the spiral arm structure of the milky way based on @xcite and @xcite , derived from hii regions and molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic bar is shown with an orientation of 14   and 6kpc of total length ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both ocs are compared with the spatial distribution of the ocs with known age and distance from the sun given in the webda database .",
    "two age groups are considered , clusters younger and older than 1gyr . in the inner galaxy , dynamical interactions with the disk , the tidal pull of the galactic bulge , and collisions with giant molecular clouds , tend to destroy ocs , especially the poorly - populated ones , on a timescale of a few @xmath0yr ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", it should be expected to find old ocs preferentially outside the solar circle ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , a region with lowered tidal stress from the galaxy and with less probability of encounters with giant molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar scenario , with the outer disk hosting predominantly the old population , has been observed in other galaxies as well , e.g. ngc300 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of bright stars in young ocs , on the other hand , allows them to be detected farther than the old ones , especially towards the central galaxy .",
    "central regions more distant than @xmath49kpc begin to be critically affected by completeness effects ( due to crowding and high background levels ) and enhanced disruption rates ( e.g. @xcite ) . besides",
    ", all directions show a depletion in the number of ocs detected farther than @xmath49kpc .",
    "teutsch145 , and especially 146 , are located close to the crux - scutum arm , among the most ( centrally ) distant ocs so far detected .",
    "since they are projected essentially low on the disk ( @xmath50 ) , tidal stresses related to collisions with the spiral arm may have induced dynamical effects on them ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ struc ] , the central cusp in the rdps may be an example of such an effect . the preferential low - mass star loss , and the resulting mf flattening , might also reflect this mechanism .",
    "however , given the distance of the clusters ( sect .",
    "[ dfp ] ) , the galileo photometry could not detect the sub - solar mass range ( sect .",
    "[ mf ] ) .    in any case , for both ocs to retain a significant amount of stellar mass ( at least @xmath51 ) after spending a few @xmath0yrs in the inner galaxy , their primordial masses might have been significantly higher than the present values .",
    "we use bvi photometry obtained with the tng ( 3.58 m ) telescope to derive astrophysical parameters and investigate the nature of the two optically faint and poorly known ocs teutsch145 ( @xmath52 ) and teutsch146 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "located in the @xmath16 quadrant , both ocs present heavily field - contaminated cmds , which makes their nature and properties difficult to establish from optical studies in smaller telescopes .",
    "decontaminated cmds show that the two clusters exhibit similar properties , basically a well - populated ms together with a few giants . from these",
    "we derive ages of @xmath1myr and @xmath2myr , and distances from the sun @xmath3kpc and @xmath4kpc , respectively for teutsch145 and 146 .",
    "their mass functions , detected for stars more massive than @xmath54 , present slopes similar to salpeter s imf . extrapolated to the h - burning limit , both cluster masses are of the order of @xmath55 , which would characterise them as relatively massive ocs . intrinsically , they are bright ocs , with integrated @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively",
    ". however , given the limited spatial range of the observations , the present - day mass values may be somewhat higher .",
    "teutsch145 and 146 are located in the inner galaxy ( more than 2kpc inside the solar circle ) , a region where cluster - disruption processes are important . besides , they are close to the crux - scutum arm . thus , given the ages , their primordial masses must have been higher than the present - day values . with respect to the radial density distribution of stars , they both present a cusp in the innermost region , which might reflect dynamical effects induced by the important external tidal stresses acting along a few @xmath0yrs",
    ". the present analysis may shed light on issues such as cluster stability , tidal disruption rates and the future cluster evolution in such harsh environment .",
