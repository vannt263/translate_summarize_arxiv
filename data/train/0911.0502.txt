    "one of the greatest of the many mysteries of radio pulsars is their evolutionary histories . as pulsars age",
    ", powerful electromagnetic torques act to increase the rotation period , @xmath3 , of the strongly magnetized neutron star , causing the spin - frequency , @xmath4 , to decrease over time , a phenomenon known as spin - down .",
    "this can be described by the equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter known as the braking index , with @xmath7 for a magnetic dipole rotating in a vacuum .",
    "the spin - down torque acting on the star is proportional to @xmath8 , and it decays over time as @xmath8 decreases .    there is also evidence that @xmath9 is not constant , but rather is also changing over time . the surface dipole magnetic field strength at the magnetic equator , assuming that the spin and magnetic axes are orthogonal , is conventionally given by @xmath10 ; at the magnetic poles the field strength is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 tends to be bigger for younger pulsars than for older ones having a large spin - down age , @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "this in turn suggests that @xmath9 tends to reduce with increasing age , and much conjecture remains about the origin(s ) of this evolution .",
    "many authors have argued that the main contributor to the @xmath9-evolution is the progressive alignment of the spin and magnetic axes : e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but @xcite and @xcite have argued in favour of a random distribution of the inclination angles between the angular velocity and magnetic axes and against magnetic alignment .",
    "others have favoured magnetic field decay ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while there are also authors who argue for continuing counter - alignment to eventual orthogonality of the axes , via an electromagnetic torque exerted by magnetospheric electric currents flowing on open field lines @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , pulsars initially counter - align ( via a strongly temperature - dependent dissipative torque in the fluid interior ) to reach the orthogonal rotator state after about @xmath14yr , where they remain for @xmath15@xmath16yr ( while the dissipative torque decays as the interior cools ) , after which alignment ( via electromagnetic torque ) occurs .",
    "if @xmath9 were constant , the braking index @xmath6 would be equal to the _ apparent _ braking index , @xmath17 if @xmath18 can be determined from observations of a pulsar , then @xmath19 can be computed . however , if @xmath9 is varying , then in general @xmath20 . some authors ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have argued that , for pulsars of moderate age , @xmath19 exceeds the value of 3 that corresponds to magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "this could be taken to imply that either magnetic alignment or field decay must be occurring .",
    "however , it is likely that recovery from unseen pulsar glitches is the principal contribution to measured variations in @xmath21 @xcite for these pulsars .    in this paper",
    ", we shall use the pulsar evolution models from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cb83 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cb86 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c93 ) , which all invoke a progressive alignment of the spin and magnetic axes .",
    "the cb83 model develops the pulsewidth - age relation on the assumption that all pulsars move along the same evolutionary track , differing only in age and orientation with respect to earth .",
    "the cb86 model relaxes this assumption and allows a distribution of alignment time - scales , as well as a time - varying relationship between characteristic and actual age .",
    "the c93 models additionally allow a distribution of initial inclination angles .",
    "all of these models predicted a minimum in the mean pulsewidth as a function of characteristic age and provided a good fit to the available data , consisting of 293 pulsewidth values from the @xcite catalogue .",
    "here we use the atnf ( australia telescope national facility ) pulsar catalogue @xcite , version 1.35 , to investigate pulsar evolution through magnetic alignment using the candy  blair models .",
    "this contemporary catalogue contains much larger data sets of 872 and 1420 isolated radio pulsars with 10  per  cent and 50  per  cent intensity pulsewidth values , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it also contains many more old pulsars than was previously the case , which tend to have lower radio luminosities .",
    "it thus allows a more precise analysis of pulsar evolution . as a consistency check",
    ", we also examine separately those pulsars with pulsewidths measured during the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite , giving @xmath22 and @xmath23 data sets of 377 and 934 pulsars respectively .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : magneticalignmenttheory ] presents a summary of the theory of alignment between the spin and magnetic axes ; section  [ sec : pulsewidthevolution ] gives a mathematical description of pulsewidth evolution ; in section  [ sec : data : fitting ] we least - squares fit the evolutionary pulsewidth models to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 data as functions of characteristic age ; in section  [ sec : analysis ] we further analyse these results , in particular comparing them to the inclination angle estimates of @xcite and @xcite ; and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the candy  blair pulsar evolution models are based on two effects .",
    "one is progressive alignment of the spin and magnetic axes , for which the formula describing the alignment phase of the @xcite model is adopted : this has an exponential decay of the sine of the magnetic - spin inclination angle , @xmath24 , from its initial value @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the pulsar s age and @xmath28 is the alignment time - scale .",
    "the alignment has a simple electromechanical origin : the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an oblique rotating dipole results in a torque on the star that causes the angular velocity axis to migrate through the neutron star toward alignment with the magnetic axis .",
    "the second effect is progressive narrowing of the emission cone , described by a power - law dependence of its half - angle , @xmath29 , on the rotation period , @xmath3 : @xmath30 with @xmath31 a positive constant having a value between @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .    for a pulsar with constant rotational inertia and fixed magnetic moment vector , the rotation period evolves according to @xmath34 = constant",
    ". it was pointed out long ago @xcite that this simple rule is incompatible with the observed distribution of pulsars in the @xmath3@xmath21 plane , conflicting with stationary ` flow ' through that plane to pulsar ` death ' at advanced ages .",
    "however , alignment produces an effective reduction in the magnetic moment , reducing the torque in proportion to @xmath35 ; so , in the jones model , the period evolves according to @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath6 ( the braking index ) constant .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pdotpn ] ) integrates to give : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pulsar s initial period and @xmath39 is its limiting period as @xmath40 . assuming that pulsars eventually slow substantially from their initial spin period , @xmath41",

    "we note that , because @xmath38 has effectively been taken as zero in going from ( [ eq : p : t ] ) to ( [ eq : p : t : approx ] ) for @xmath43 , equation  ( [ eq : rho : t : approx ] ) is not applicable to the very youngest pulsars : for @xmath48 it reduces to @xmath49 which diverges as @xmath50 . for the typical parameter values ( see section  [ sec : datafits ] table  [ table :",
