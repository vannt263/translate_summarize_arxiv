    "we would like to add that , in the adopted formalism , it is impossible to distinguish the effect of inter - valley scattering or to determine it s contribution towards conductivity .",
    "however , since we are dealing with very short range scatterers , it would be impossible to avoid large momentum interactions and hence inter - valley scattering .",
    "in order to study localization , we looked at ipr versus energy eigenvaluei(not shown ) and found that ipr is not sensitive enough to capture signatures of localization for small @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we , again , turn towards the energy resolved studies of averaged current matrix elements squared , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energyres ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , for a few states close to the band centre have a very large averaged current matrix element squared value .",
    "this implies that these state are extended .",
    "we notice that this is the case independent of the system size .",
    "also , the experimental finding of a universal zero - bias minimum conductivity , @xmath12 suggests that the states close to the band centre should be extended , as we find which is in conformity with the findings of amini _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "this , however , is in contradiction with the findings of xiong _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "one might , also , question the @xmath121 dependence on the energy eigenvalues , @xmath50 since it could very well be a finite - size effect . for low disorder strength , the localization length",
    ", @xmath122 varies exponentially with the inverse of disorder strength i.e. @xmath123 and in order to see the effects of localization , one needs to change the system size exponentially.we note that the @xmath124 behaviour is present at all system sizes starting from system containing nearly 300 lattice points((8,10 ) ) to nearly 3000 lattice points((24,30 ) ) .    also , that for @xmath1=3 , the @xmath125 is independent of @xmath50 ( not shown ) suggesting a disorder induced crossover from localized to delocalized phase for @xmath126 .",
    "we check this by studying the averaged current matrix element squared over a range of @xmath1 for different system sizes , at a fixed energy .",
    "we have fixed the energy at @xmath127 and have considered ten states around this energy .",
    "we study the contribution of these ten states towards the @xmath125 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.([fig : m_w ] ) .",
    "the inset of fig.([fig : m_w ] ) shows the plot between averaged current matrix element squared over a range of @xmath1 for three different system sizes ( 16,20),(20,24 ) and ( 24,30 ) .",
    "the cross - over is highlighted in the main panel which shows the logarithm of averaged current matrix elements squared versus @xmath1 .",
    "we indeed find a crossover around @xmath1=3 .",
    "however , this crossover is not between localized and delocalized phases but from localized to a very weakly localized behaviour .",
    "this is in agreement with the scaling theory of localization which predicts that all states in 2d are localized .",
    "we , now , compare the normalized conductivity , @xmath128 between square lattice and graphene for @xmath1 = 5 . this comparision has been shown in fig.([fig : comparsq ] ) .",
    "we observe that the conductivity matches well at large frequencies for both the lattices .",
    "however , at low frequencies , the grahene has a lower conductivity suggesting that the states are more localized .",
    "this could mean that the states in graphene are more susceptible to localized when subject to disorder , as also suggested by xiong _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite    we also compare the intensity plots for graphene and square lattice for different values of disorder strengths and fixed system size .",
    "the results are shown in fig([fig : comparsq2 ] ) .",
    "we find that there is no signature fo puddle formation for square lattice .",
    "the reason for the formation of puddle for low carrier concentration in graphene is yet to be understood .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the finite - frequency electrical conductivity in graphene under diagonal ( on - site ) disorder of various strength and in the presence of inter - valley scattering using kubo - greenwood foumula . for moderate disorder strength",
    ", we find that for differnt system sizes , fixed @xmath1 , scaling theory is at work .",
    "we made contact with the weak localization result of abrahams _ _ et al.__@xcite and found a very good agreement which means that for @xmath74 , logarithmic scaling is obeyed .",
    "we compare normalized conductivity of graphene with that of a square lattice and find that graphene is more susceptible to localization when subject to disorder .",
    "we have established that , for low disorder strength , @xmath129 , the states away from the band centre are more localized comared to the ones close to the band centre . for low disorder strength",
    ", we have calculated the conductivity for low - disordered graphene and have found the results are in disagreement with that of boltzmann conductivity .",
    "also , the conductivity and mobility are in qualitative agreement with experiments . also , for weak disorder strength , it is the competition between @xmath130 and dos which gives rise to a universal conductivity minimum .",
    "the linear rise of conductivity with carrier concentration is due to a term unaccounted for in the boltzmann expression for conductivity .",
    "we have also established that , for low disorder strength , @xmath129 , the states close to the band centre are extended and that there exists a crossover at @xmath1 @xmath110 3 .",
    "comparative study of intensity plots for states close to the band centre for graphene with square lattice shows clear signatures of puddle formation in graphene .",
    "although we have studied a simple disorder model in graphene , some of the feature studied could be generic .",
