    "this article is a numerical and theoretical analysis of _ reactive trajectories _ between two metastable states of the 1-d stochastic allen - cahn equation .",
    "reactive trajectories are paths which directly connect two stable or metastable sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "metastability is ubiquitous in physics and chemistry , for instance in solid state physics @xcite , physical chemistry @xcite or molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied recently in new fields , for instance in fluid dynamics systems , like in 2-d navier ",
    "stokes equations @xcite , turbulent von - karman flows @xcite , turbulent convection @xcite , or wall turbulence @xcite . in oceanic and atmospheric flows ,",
    "well - known examples are the bimodal behavior of the kuroshio paths @xcite , thermohaline circulation in the north - atlantic @xcite or zonal - blocking transitions in the midlatitude atmosphere @xcite ; in geophysics , one can also think of reversal of dynamos @xcite .",
    "many of these systems can be modeled by stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .    in the last three decades , the stochastic allen ",
    "cahn equations and more generally reaction - diffusion equations have become central in the mathematical study of spdes @xcite .",
    "they exhibit both relative simplicity and nontrivial behavior such as bimodality and effects of large dimensions .",
    "they are widely used for the study of phase - ordering kinetic ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , the stochastic allen ",
    "cahn equations can be found in fluid mechanics as a convenient model of long - wavelength modulations in turbulent couette flows ( where it is termed ginzburg  landau equation ) @xcite , or in the context of quantum mechanics as a model of a double - well oscillator ( see @xcite ) . in these systems ,",
    "the metastable state comprise of a single phase in the whole domain .",
    "meanwhile , during reactive trajectories the domain contains subdomains of different phases separated by _",
    "fronts_.    for systems with one degree of freedom like stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , solutions of the fokker ",
    "planck equations can often be obtained and analyzed analytically @xcite . as a consequence , all the statistics of reactive trajectories can be inferred .",
    "however , when the system of interest has too many degrees of freedom , an explicit use of such methods is often impossible . in such situations",
    ", several approaches can bring insight on the transitions .",
    "the discussion mostly depends on the noise amplitude . for relatively large noise ,",
    "transitions between metastable states can be computed by direct numerical simulations . as the noise intensity decreases",
    ", these transitions occur with smaller transition rates and are therefore more difficult to observe using direct numerical simulations . in such a case ,",
    "a possibility is to consider the small - noise limit theories such as the freidlin ",
    "wentzell @xcite or the eyring ",
    "kramers @xcite asymptotic theories for transition rates . the freidlin  wentzell large - deviation theory describes the most probable transition called _ instanton _ and the eyring ",
    "kramers expression gives the full formula , with the sub - exponential prefactor , for the mean first transition time or equivalently the transition rate .",
    "this formula holds strictly for gradient stochastic differential equations , but can be generalised ( with modification ) to a larger class of non - gradient system @xcite .",
    "the case of spdes offers another level of difficulty : large - deviations results are very difficult to establish in general .",
    "for instance , it is not even known if a large - deviation principle exists for the allen  cahn equation in large dimension of space @xcite . however , since the seminal work of faris & jona - lasinio @xcite , the 1-d allen  cahn equation appears to be now well understood ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and follow the classical finite dimension phenomenology .",
    "note that even for finite - dimensional systems , serious theoretical difficulties may also arise when the saddle points of the deterministic dynamics are degenerated @xcite , or even worst , when the local attractors representing the metastable states are non - isolated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these large - deviation theories have been used with success on some spdes ( see e.g. @xcite ) including the stochastic allen ",
    "cahn equations where finite - time instantons have also been numerically computed with great accuracy @xcite",
    ". another relevant approach of spdes is the direct computation of instantons @xcite using essentially a geometrical approach @xcite .    in the 1-d allen  cahn case , if the domain is not too small , instantons and transitions between metastable states take the form of fronts propagating from one side of the domain to the other .",
    "previous results like the calculation of e _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite as well as the small - noise limit theories in general do not take into account finite - amplitude noise effects . as will be discussed in this article , the range of validity of the freidlin ",
    "wentzell asymptotic regime is however extremely limited .",
    "the regime with noise too large to reach the freidlin - wentzell asymptotic , but still small enough for the event to be rare , occupies a very large area of the parameter space for partial differential equations . for symmetric potentials , a theoretical analysis of metastability for the 1-d allen  cahn case can be tackled if the size of the domain is large compared to the front thickness @xcite . in this case , the propagation of the fronts is a random walk .",
    "all things considered , the approaches are very diverse and leave whole areas of the parameter space unexplored . in particular , the limit of validity of eyring  kramers and freidlin ",
    "wentzell theories has never been considered precisely .",
    "we propose here to give a global description of the statistical behavior of 1-d allen  cahn equation for arbitrary noise amplitude as well as finite - size domains .    in order to do that",
    ", we consider a new numerical tool dedicated to the computation of rare events and in particular reactive trajectories .",
    "this algorithm is called _ adaptive multilevel splitting _ ( ams ) and has been proposed rather recently by crou & guyader @xcite .",
    "it corresponds in fact to a modern adaptive version of the classical multilevel splitting algorithm introduced in the 50s by kahn & harris @xcite and rosenbluth & rosenbluth @xcite .",
    "classical splitting algorithms have been very popular in the last few decades and have been applied in many areas of physics ( chemistry , molecular dynamics and networks ) .",
    "this class of algorithms is now better understood from a mathematical point of view and have become an important area of research in probability theory @xcite .",
    "ams appears to be very efficient and robust , it is moreover much less sensitive to tuning parameters than the classical versions and can in principle be applied to systems with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , the main constraint is to work with markovian systems .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is rather simple to grasp : it is essentially a go - with - the - winner strategy ( or successive iterations of the weakest link game ) in the space of trajectories . at the start of the algorithm ,",
    "one generates an ensemble of trajectories which are statistically independent and identically distributed . by successively eliminating the bad trajectories and generating new ones by splitting them from the good trajectories ,",
    "one is able to obtain easily a whole set of trajectories connecting one metastable state to another . in principle , this can be done for any amplitude of the noise and possibly for more exotic colored noise as well .",
    "one is then able to perform statistics for rare events such as estimating the distribution of the duration of reactive trajectories .",
    "although theoretical subtleties still remain regarding convergence properties @xcite , ams approach is likely to offer one of the most efficient tool for handling rare events computation . until now this algorithm has only been applied to sdes with a small number of degrees of freedom , and mostly for test and convergence analysis .",
    "one of the main aim of this study is demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of this algorithm in high dimensional and spatially extended systems as well .",
    "moreover , as will be shown , the numerical results will provide a much broader view on the theory of reactive trajectories .",
    "a sketch of the algorithm is shown in fig.[sketch ] . a detailed discussion is also given in the appendices  [ ad ] and  [ ac ] together with a pseudo - code description .",
    "in the text ) is shown in black starting from a fixed point @xmath2 and its final portion corresponding to the so - called reactive trajectory ( with mean duration called @xmath3 in the text ) is shown in red .",
    "lower panel : after generating @xmath4 i.i.d .",
    "trajectories starting from @xmath5 , ams is eliminating the trajectory with the worst excursion ( here trajectory 1 corresponding to @xmath6 ) with respect to the reaction coordinate @xmath7 ( see appendix ) and replaces it using information picked from a randomly chosen trajectories among the @xmath8  better \" ones ( here @xmath9 and trajectory 2 is chosen by 50@xmath10 chance ) .",
    "this is done by restarting a new trajectory from the initial condition ( the red dot in the figure ) .",
    "this process is repeated until all trajectories has reach the set @xmath1 before @xmath0.,width=377 ]    this article shows several results .",
    "we are able to obtain a complete theoretical and numerical statistical description of the reactive trajectories for the 1-d stochastic allen  cahn equation in the parameter plane spanned by the inverse temperature @xmath11 and the length @xmath12 of the domain .",
    "those are the only control parameters of the allen  cahn equation once properly rescaled .",
    "we also discuss the type of reactive trajectories , the transition rate , the mean first passage time and the duration of reactive trajectories as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we show that only a small portion of the parameter plane for large @xmath11 and small @xmath12 leads to ensemble of reactive trajectories that concentrate close to the most probable one , as could be expected from freidlin  wentzell theory and instanton phenomenology .",
    "we investigate the transition rate and the mean first - passage time and recover the classical eyring  kramer law in this narrow band of the parameter plane .",
    "we show in particular that the prefactor has an exponential dependence in the size .",
    "we are also able to distinguish the limit of validity of this law . in some parts of the parameter space , for finite - amplitude noise ,",
    "reactive trajectories are close to instantons from a geometric point of vue , but their temporal evolution is not close to the instanton one , by contrast to the freidlin  wentzell regime case . in particular , they are characterized by a random - walk propagation of their fronts . for a very large size , the system presents the properties of a potential with a extremely flat saddle .",
    "this may be related to the case of non - quadratic saddles for which classical results breakdown@xcite .",
    "note that this can also be studied in a case where the global minima of the potential do not have the same height @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is described by an effective potential whose curvature at the saddle in exponentially small in @xmath12 .",
    "we can write and solve a coupled master / fokker  plank equations that describes the position of the front . from this , we can calculate the transition rate and show that its prefactor is not exponential in @xmath12 , as would be expected from eyring - kramers expression with an exponentially small curvature , but rather polynomial .",
    "however , the transition rate retains its large deviations properties in @xmath11 .",
    "this analytical result is verified by numerical computations using ams .",
    "we are also able to investigate the statistics of the reactive trajectory durations as well .",
    "we find two distinct regimes of large curvature and small curvature at the saddle where the duration scales like @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "moreover , in the large curvature regime , the distribution of durations follows a gumbel distribution like for one degree of freedom systems @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , these are new results .",
    "the structure of this work is as follow .",
    "we first introduce the 1-d stochastic allen  cahn and its deterministic solutions in section [ s2 ] .",
    "we then perform in section [ s3 ] a theoretical analysis of metastability in allen  cahn equation using small noise theories such as freidlin  wentzell large deviation theory and eyring  kramers law .",
    "section [ s4 ] extensively makes use of the ams algorithm for computing numerically ensemble of reactive trajectories in various regimes of the allen  cahn equation",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the comparison between theory and numerics in the range of parameters where both are valid .",
    "we discuss these results in the conclusion (   [ s5 ] ) .",
    "we present here the 1-d stochastic allen  cahn equation with a definition of the control parameters and some properties of the stationary solutions of the associated deterministic allen  cahn equation .",
    "the nondimensional 1-d stochastic allen  cahn equation with dirichlet boundary conditions reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a white noise in space and time , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it has several names : it is often called the allen  cahn equation in mathematics and solid state physics @xcite and the chaffee  infante in climate science . in non - linear physics ,",
    "it is one of the several instances of ginzburg  landau equation @xcite . in the study of the deterministic front propagation in biology , it is a particular case of the fisher  kolmogorov equation @xcite .",
    "after change of temporal , spatial and amplitude scales , there are only two free parameters , the nondimensional inverse temperature @xmath11 and the nondimensional size of the domain @xmath12 . with this scaling choice , the size of the boundary layers , fronts and coherent length is of order one .",
    "we recall an important property of the allen  cahn equation which is essential for theoretical considerations : it is a gradient system ( for the @xmath18 scalar product ) with respect to the potential @xmath19 @xmath20 this formulation allows one to have an easier understanding of the phase space structure and dynamics of the allen  cahn equation .      stationary solutions of the deterministic allen  cahn equation",

    "cahn equations whereas saddle points indicate possible pathways between them . equation ( [ pot ] ) can be solved using the analogy of a pendulum of period @xmath12 in a potential @xmath23 where @xmath5 plays the role of time .",
    "provided @xmath12 is not too small , there are two stable solutions denoted @xmath24 and one unstable solution @xmath25 ( fig .  [ figsols ] ) @xmath26 the two stable solutions correspond to the global minima of @xmath19 ( eq .",

    "note that the allen  cahn equation without boundary conditions and the diffusive part @xmath33 has a whole family of stationary solutions solving @xmath34 .",
    "these solutions can arbitrarily jump from the values + 1 and -1 at any points of the domain .",
    "the diffusive term together with the boundary conditions select some of these solutions .",

    "we present here the theoretical approaches we use to analyse metastability .",
    "we also complement these by specific discussions and results whenever it is necessary .",

    "cahn equations are in fact ill - defined when the spatial dimension is strictly larger than one ( which is not the case , we have considered in this work ) @xcite .",
    "one has to renormalize the equation properly so that large - deviation results can then be obtained in dimension 2 and 3 which are very difficult to demonstrate @xcite .",
    "in fact , the question is largely open in dimension larger than 3 . at the level of the prefactor of eyring - kramer law",

    "a general property of such systems is that @xmath122 goes to zero in the infinite size limit while the rest of the prefactor is unchanged .",
    "we therefore concentrate our effort on that eigenvalue @xmath123 : it controls the size dependence of the mean first passage time .",

    "there is no unique way to measure how far a trajectory is escaping from the return set @xmath400 , or put in another way there is no unique order relation in the space of trajectories .",

    "there are two sets of parameters to take into account : first , the spde discretisation with timestep @xmath461 and spatial resolution @xmath462 , second , the number @xmath4 of the trajectories in the algorithm and the choice of the reaction coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "we first illustrate the convergence properties of the spde itself .",

    "that , in order to ensure the stability of the numerical integration of the diffusive part , the constraint is to have @xmath465 .",
    "the choice of @xmath461 in addition to this constraint crucially depends on the accuracy of hitting times ( of @xmath400 and isosurfaces of the reaction coordinate @xmath7 ) needed in the algorithm .",
    "it is well - known that these hitting times converge like @xmath466 @xcite bringing a limit to the accuracy of the solution and the probability @xmath327 found by the algorithm as well ( see @xcite ) .",
