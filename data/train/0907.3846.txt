    "despite enormous efforts in recent years , the electronic properties of graphene near the neutrality point that separates conduction and valence bands are still under intense investigations .",
    "theories aimed at describing graphene via a dirac - like equation have elucidated many intriguing effects like the physics of massless relativistic particles and klein tunneling@xcite , which has been experimentally observed recently.@xcite the dirac - fermion approach , which represents an approximation to the true lattice situation , is believed to be valid especially close to energy zero , the so called dirac points , where the conduction and valence bands touch each other and the dispersion is linear .",
    "furthermore , nearest neighbor tight - binding descriptions,@xcite which particularly emphasize the hexagonal lattice structure of the carbon sheet , have proven to be extremely helpful in understanding the basic transport properties of this promising new material .",
    "based on the observation of a peculiar quantum hall effect@xcite , it is generally accepted by now that some kind of disorder must be present in the experimental setup . the disorder influences the charge transport through the graphene sheet and affects the measurable quantities at least quantitatively.@xcite yet , which type of disorder is encountered in real samples is still completely unclear or only partly known in some special cases .",
    "this lack of knowledge is particularly unfortunate as the definite type of disorder entirely determines the physical properties,@xcite e.g. , leading to complete anderson localization in the case of short range electrostatic scattering potentials via chiral symmetry breaking and scattering between valleys.@xcite for disordered systems , even the single particle density of states ( dos ) near the dirac point remains still under debate . depending on the disorder type and approach , a vanishing ,",
    "a finite , or an infinite dos at the dirac point has been suggested for graphene or related models.@xcite    also , the interpretation of experimental results is hampered by the uncertainty regarding the precise form of the dos .",
    "recently , following earlier experimental investigations of the landau level splitting in high magnetic fields,@xcite the opening of a spin ( zeeman ) gap in the density of states at the dirac point has been suggested in the interpretation of magneto - transport measurements on graphene sheets.@xcite only if a gap , separating electron and hole states at the dirac point , was assumed , the experimental data could be accounted for .",
    "another unexplained experimental observation to be found near the dirac point in the presence of a strong magnetic field is the divergent resistance,@xcite which has been attracting considerable attention lately .",
    "theoretically , the opening of a mobility gap within the central landau band has been recently discovered by means of detailed two - terminal conductance calculations.@xcite it was found that with increasing disorder , the critical energies where the plateau transitions of the hall conductivity take place , move apart .",
    "this splitting of the central conductance peak unveiled the existence of an extra chiral quantum phase transition occurring at zero energy with critical properties that differ from those of the quantum hall transitions.@xcite    in the present work , the single particle density of states is calculated numerically for the same bricklayer lattice model .",
    "the presumed ripple disorder is modeled by a spatially varying random magnetic flux with zero mean , pointing perpendicular to the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "also , an additional constant magnetic field is applied that leads to the formation of landau bands .",
    "it is shown that in the disordered case , the density of states goes to zero at the dirac point not only in the absence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "rather , a narrow suppression in the dos is obtained also in the presence of a finite magnetic field within the lowest ( central ) landau band .",
    "this unexpected feature depends essentially on the disorder strength , on the system size , and on the strength of the perpendicular constant magnetic field . due to the neglect of electron spin in the model hamiltonian",
    ", this outcome can not be attributed to a zeeman splitting , but must originate from chirality and a disorder - induced interaction between the two sub - lattices .",
    "this consideration is confirmed by the observation that the addition of short - range potential disorder completely destroys the dos - depression near the dirac point .",
    "in the present study , the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice responsible for the peculiar electronic properties of graphene is replaced by a bricklayer model@xcite which shares the same topology as the hexagonal lattice .",

    "width=283 ]    the occurrence of the dos - depression in the absence of short - range diagonal disorder for @xmath3 could be explained if the elastic scattering length diverged at the dirac point .",
    "then , for increasing system size a decreasing energy range around @xmath37 would exist where the elastic scattering length is larger than @xmath52 . within this energy interval",
    ", the transport would be almost ballistic and , due to the absence of scattering events , the dos approaches the result of the ordered case and drops to zero at @xmath37 .",
    "if this size dependence of the dos - depression were accessible in experiments , it would open the possibility for obtaining information about the elastic scattering length .    due to the lack of an analytical theory for the density of states of a disordered bricklayer model near the dirac point , a relation proposed in the context of the thermal quantum hall effect@xcite and recently for disordered dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice@xcite was ventured .",
    "while the empirical relation ( [ empir ] ) used to fit the numerical results seems to work quite well , one has to keep in mind that only analytical calculations for a lattice model in the presence of random magnetic flux will eventually help to understand the complete situation .",
    "the usual way to start from the continuum dirac equation may turn out to be not appropriate for a comprehensive description , if the depression in the density of states found in the present study would not show up in the former description .",
    "the implication of this observation and its impact on the scaling behavior and the critical properties at the dirac point is evident , but still needs to be investigated .",
    "usually , a noncritical density of states with a smooth energy dependence is assumed in the scaling analysis . in particular , the strong energy and size dependence reported above necessitate a reassessment of the conventional procedure applied in ref .  .",
    "although the disorder and magnetic field dependent depression found in the density of states at the dirac point and the occurrence of the conductance peak splitting reported previously@xcite are in agreement with several aspects observed in experiments mentioned in the introduction , it is clear that many - body effects and also single particle interactions like zeeman splitting or spin - orbit scattering , which were not taken into account in the present investigations , may turn out to be the dominant effects in understanding these experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the results of the calculations presented above may be helpful in finding out which type of disorder determines the electronic properties of real graphene samples .",
