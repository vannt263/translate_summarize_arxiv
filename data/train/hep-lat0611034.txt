    "anderson  @xcite considered the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a nearest - neighbor hopping operator ( a discretized laplacian ) and @xmath3 a random potential .",
    "this hamiltonian mimics that of a crystal doped with random impurities .",
    "an eigenmode @xmath4 can be _ localized _ , meaning that @xmath5 decays exponentially for large @xmath6 : the electron can not hop to infinity , and this mode does not contribute to the electric conductivity of the material .",
    "otherwise , the eigenmode is _",
    "extended_. anderson showed that eigenmodes were always localized , if the disorder in @xmath3 was large enough , or the energy low enough .",
    "this is intuitively clear : at very high energy , the random potential plays no role and eigenmodes are extended , plane - wave - like ; but at low energy , sufficient randomness in the potential may forbid hopping to any of the neighboring sites .",
    "thus , the spectrum looks generically as in fig .  1",
    ", with a _ mobility edge _ @xmath7 separating the localized from the extended regime",
    ". @xmath7 may lie above or below the ground - state energy depending on the disorder , allowing for a so - called quantum transition at zero temperature .",
    "diakonov and petrov  @xcite proposed an analogous explanation for the qcd chiral transition at temperature @xmath8 . since @xmath9  @xcite",
    ", the spectral properties of the dirac operator , described by the density @xmath10 , must change with temperature . recalling that an instanton supports a chiral zero mode @xmath11 ( for each fermion flavor ) , one considers the dirac spectrum for a linear superposition of instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "the exact zero modes are now displaced .",
    "the infrared spectrum results from diagonalizing the effective dirac matrix @xmath12 of overlap elements @xmath13 between individual instantons and antiinstantons zeromodes . at @xmath14 ,",
    "this overlap decreases as @xmath15 , and gives rise to extended modes having support on all instantons and antiinstantons , and an essentially uniform spectrum near zero .",
    "such extended modes can be observed on the lattice ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "as the temperature increases , the density of instantons decreases ( their action @xmath16 increases ) and @xmath17 now decays exponentially @xmath18 in spatial directions . both factors may trigger a transition to localization , which suppresses near - zero eigenvalues and restores chiral symmetry .     pair , but _ not _ to obtain the dirac eigenmode . ]    as in anderson s bosonic case , this is a disorder - driven transition .",
    "but dirac eigenvalues come in pure imaginary pairs @xmath19 , and the focus here is on the center of the spectrum @xmath20 .",
    "correspondingly , the transition can be modeled by _",
    "chiral _ random matrices  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the diakonov - petrov scenario does not require instantons , but only chiral zero modes .",
    "it turns out that other topological defects - domain - walls , monopoles , vortices - also support chiral zero modes . under the working assumption that extended modes have support on the union of topological defects ,",
    "this opens the possibility to determine the topological vacuum structure from the spatial distribution of low - lying eigenmodes .",
    "this approach is gauge - invariant and requires no smoothing / cooling of the gauge field .",
    "to characterize how localized or extended a mode @xmath21 is , one uses the _ inverse participation ratio _ @xmath22 .",
    "this ratio of moments is equal to 1 if @xmath23 is completely localized , and to @xmath3 if @xmath24 is completely delocalized .",
    "if @xmath25 on a fraction @xmath26 of the sites , 0 elsewhere , then @xmath27 , which justifies its name .",
    "of course one should consider the continuum limit @xmath28 of the lattice study .",
    "note that the fraction @xmath26 of occupied sites , hence the ipr , remains constant as @xmath28 for any type of macroscopic object .",
    "conversely , if the object is `` thin '' and lives on a submanifold of dimension @xmath29 and volume @xmath30 , then @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , which diverges as @xmath28 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
