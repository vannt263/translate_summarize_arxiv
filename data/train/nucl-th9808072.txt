    "a new and exciting frontier of physics is opening before us with the advent of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern.@xmath1 at rhic , a 20 tev gold nucleus will hit head - on another 20 tev gold nucleus , and the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of two colliding nucleons will be about 200 gev .",
    "this is far from the energy regime where nucleon - nucleon interaction has been extensively studied .",
    "also , at rhic temperatures of the order of 200 mev and nuclear densities about ten times the normal nuclear density are expected to be reached . at lhc in lead - lead collision , the c.m .",
    "energy of two colliding nucleons will be 5.4 tev  much greater than that at rhic .",
    "clearly , we have to confront questions such as these :    \\1 .",
    "what kind of theoretical framework do we envisage to describe this new realm of physics , where nuclear matter reaches temperatures and densities comparable to that of the early universe and the interior of neutron stars ?",
    ". how do we formulate the anticipated phase transition in heavy - ion collisions from the hadronic regime to the perturbative qcd regime ?    against this backdrop ,",
    "i want to discuss an effective theory for describing nuclear matter at high density and high temperature .",
    "this effective theory emerges when the following three developments in three distinct but related areas are combined together :    \\(1 ) relativistic mean field theory ( rmft ) based on quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) models can describe realistically nuclear many - body effects and properties of finite nuclei and can provide a suitable framework to study the density and temperature dependence of nuclear matter .",
    "this conclusion has been reached by serot and walecka after an extensive review of research in this field.@xmath2 we note that a qhd model is a field theory model based on an effective local lagrangian density , that has hadronic degrees of freedom such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and nucleons as basic fermions.@xmath7    \\(2 ) extensive studies by various groups have shown that the nucleon can be described as a topological soliton in the gauged nonlinear @xmath4-model ( nl@xmath4 m ) that has @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 as the dynamical degrees of freedom and that predicts successfully the low energy properties of the nucleon down to distances of the order of 0.5 f.@xmath8    \\(3 ) phenomenological analysis of high energy elastic @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering in the c.m .",
    "energy range @xmath11 gev @xmath12 shows strong evidence in favor of the topological soliton model of the nucleon .",
    "the analysis , however , also indicates that the soliton is embedded in a condensed ground state of quarks and antiquarks.@xmath13 the @xmath14 ground state is analogous to a superconducting ground state and provides an outer cloud of the nucleon , which is responsible for diffraction scattering .    as we will see in the following sections , the effective theory we arrive at is the gauged linear @xmath4-model with hidden symmetry and spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "we note that effective theories  based on the nambu - jona - lassinio model,@xmath15 the lee - wick - friedberg model,@xmath16 the meson - quark - dilaton model @xmath17 of the nucleon have been applied by various groups to investigate the density and temperature dependence of nuclear matter and chiral phase transition.@xmath18 our approach brings in a new element to such investigations ; namely , the phenomenological knowledge of nucleon - nucleon interaction and nucleon structure obtained from the analysis of high energy elastic scattering at nn c.m .",

    "to see how the three developments mentioned in the introduction can be combined together , we first lay out a general lagrangian framework .",
    "we begin with the linear @xmath4-model of gell - mann and levy that has su(2)@xmath19 @xmath20 su(2)@xmath21 global symmetry and spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "the model is given by the lagrangian density @xmath22 \\,\\psi -\\lambda \\",

    "the pions are the goldstone bosons generated by the spontaneous breakdown of su(2)@xmath34 symmetry .",
    "let us next introduce right and left fermion fields : @xmath35 in terms of these new fields , the lagrangian density ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be written as @xmath36 -g\\,\\zeta \\,\\left [ \\bar{\\psi}_{l}\\,u\\,\\psi _ { r}+\\bar{% \\psi}_{r}\\,u^{\\dagger } \\,\\psi _ { l}\\right ] -\\lambda \\,\\left ( \\zeta ^{2}-f_{\\pi } ^{2}\\right ) ^{2}.   \\label{2.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under right and left global transformations : @xmath37 eq.([2.3 ] ) makes it evident that the lagrangian is invariant under these transformations and that the scalar - isoscalar field @xmath23 is chiral invariant .",
    "when @xmath23 is replaced by its vacuum value @xmath32 , the lagrangian ( [ 2.3 ] ) represents a nonlinear @xmath4-model ( nl@xmath4 m ) .    following bando et al .",

    "to implement the idea of a hidden local symmetry , we write @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are su(2)-valued fields which transform in the following way under [ su(2)@xmath45su(2)@xmath21]@xmath47 @xmath41 [ su(2)@xmath41u(1)]@xmath48@xmath49 where @xmath50[su(2)@xmath41u(1)]@xmath51 .",
    "eq([2.5 ] ) shows that @xmath52 as required , so that the global symmetry is maintained .",
    "let us focus on the pion sector of the lagrangian ( [ 2.3 ] ) : @xmath53   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{4}\\zeta ^{2}\\,tr\\left [ \\partial _ { \\mu } \\,\\xi _ { l}\\,\\xi _ { l}^{\\dagger } -\\partial _ { \\mu } \\,\\xi _ { r}\\,\\xi _ { r}^{\\dagger } \\right ] ^{2}. \\label{2.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we gauge this symmetry by introducing the vector mesons @xmath54 and @xmath55 as gauge bosons of the [ su(2)@xmath41u(1)]@xmath39 symmetry . gauging is done easily by replacing the ordinary derivative by the covariant derivative : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ,   \\label{2.8}\\ ] ] and @xmath58 transforms under the hidden symmetry in the following way :    @xmath59    the lagrangian density of the gauged hidden - symmetry model is taken as @xmath60 @xmath61 ^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta ^{2}\\,tr\\left [ \\left ( d_{\\mu } \\,\\xi _ { l}\\right ) \\,\\xi _ { l}^{\\dagger } + \\left ( d_{\\mu } \\,\\xi _ { r}\\right ) \\,\\xi _ { r}^{\\dagger } \\right ] ^{2}+\\frac{1}{2g^{2}}tr\\left [ f_{\\mu \\nu } \\,f^{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] ,   \\label{2.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is exactly the same as the original term @xmath62 .$ ] the second term is a gauge invariant term that generates the masses of the vector mesons .",
    "the third term is the lagrangian density of the gauge field @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the nonabelian field tensor : @xmath65 .$ ] the last term in ( [ 2.10 ] ) produces a term like @xmath66 ^{2}$ ] , where @xmath67 this is the fourth - order derivative term introduced by skyrme .",
    "we next focus on the fermion - scalar - meson sector of the lagrangian density ( [ 2.3 ] ) and introduce new fermionic variables : @xmath68 these variables are invariant under the global right and left transformations .",
    "they transform only under the local hidden symmetry : @xmath69    @xmath70_{\\text{hidden}})\\ ] ]    in terms of these new variables , the fermion - scalar - meson sector of ( [ 2.3 ] ) becomes @xmath71 \\psi ^{0 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\partial _",

    "we observe that the lagrangian density in eq.([2.13 ] ) is very similar to the lagrangian density of the nucleon - scalar - meson sector of qhd - ii , which has @xmath55 , @xmath6 , @xmath81 ( scalar - isoscalar meson ) as the hadronic degrees of freedom besides @xmath82 this similarity , of course , suggests that we identify @xmath83 as the nucleon field and allow the potential energy density of the scalar field @xmath84 to be of more general form : @xmath85 , so as to fit the bulk properties of finite nuclei and equilibrium properties of nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , if we take @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 , then under the hidden local transformation : @xmath88 and @xmath89 has to satisfy the requirement @xmath90 i.e. , the requirement for nonlinear realization of the chiral symmetry.@xmath2 eqs.([2.15a],[2.15b ] ) are , indeed , the requirements imposed on the nucleon field both in qhd - ii and in its extended version that incorporates the trace anomaly.@xmath91 we also note that the scalar field @xmath81 in ( [ 2.13 ] ) , which has a chiral invariant interaction @xmath92 , can be identified with the scalar - isoscalar field of qhd .",
    "it is not the @xmath0-field of single - boson exchange potentials with @xmath93 mev .",
    "in fact , if we write @xmath94 , then the fluctuation field @xmath95 is to be identified with the @xmath4-field . as kalafatis and vinh mau",
    "have shown,@xmath96 it is the fluctuation field @xmath95 that provides the nn medium range attraction .",
    "it is evident that the lagrangian ( [ 2.13 ] ) with a generalized @xmath97 incorporates all the main features of nucleon - scalar -meson sector of qhd - ii .",
    "turning to the lagrangian density @xmath98 in eq.([2.10 ] ) , let us consider that the scalar field @xmath23 can be replaced by its vacuum value @xmath32 .",
    "following meissner et al.,@xmath40 we add to it the anomalous action , i.e. , the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) action : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the topological baryonic current : @xmath101 ,   \\label{2.17}\\ ] ] and @xmath102 $ ] . the lagrangian density we have now : @xmath103 represents the gauged nonlinear @xmath4-model with its anomalous action .",
    "this model has been extensively studied by many groups.@xmath104 it describes the nucleon as a topological soliton and predicts successfully the low energy properties of the nucleon .",
    "also , the masses of @xmath6 and @xmath5 are generated dynamically from the gauge - invariant second term in eq.([2.10 ] ) and leads to the ksfr relation @xmath105 the last term in ( [ 2.10 ] ) , as we noted earlier , reproduces skyrme s fourth order derivative term .",
    "the discussion above shows that the lagrangian density @xmath106 with a generalized @xmath97 encompasses both qhd - ii model for nuclear matter and nl@xmath4 m for the nucleon .",
    "if , in the above lagrangian , we take the fermion to be the nucleon , drop @xmath107 and replace @xmath23 in @xmath98 by its vacuum value @xmath32 , then we essentially obtain the qhd - ii  model.@xmath2 on the other hand , if we keep @xmath98 with @xmath108 and @xmath107 , but drop @xmath80 , then we have the gauged nl@xmath4m.@xmath109 we now examine how analysis of high energy elastic scattering impacts on these two developments .    high energy elastic scattering at the cern isr and sps collider in the c.m .",
    "energy range @xmath11 gev has been analyzed by my collaborators and me over a number of years.@xmath12 from this analysis , we arrived at the following phenomenological description .",
    "the nucleon has a core and an outer cloud .",
    "high energy elastic scattering is primarily due to two processes : 1 ) a glancing collision where the outer cloud of a nucleon interacts with that of the other and gives rise to diffraction scattering ; 2 ) a hard collision where one nucleon core scatters off the other core via @xmath5 exchange , while their outer clouds overlap and interact independently . in the small momentum transfer region diffraction",
    "dominates , but as the momentum transfer increases , the hard scattering takes over.@xmath110    clearly , elastic scattering shows that the nucleon is a composite object with a core and a cloud .",
    "hence , nucleons can not be regarded as basic fermions as in qhd - ii at c.m .",
    "energies of hundreds of gev . instead",
    ", the basic fermions should be taken as more fundamental objects  quarks ( perhaps , more precisely , effective quarks ) .",
    "also , a change of fermionic variables is carried out in qhd - ii to implement the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry ( eq.([2.11 ] ) ) .",
    "path integral formalism shows that , because of the fermion measure , change of fermionic variables induces an anomalous action,@xmath111 which in this case is the wzw  action .",
    "therefore , the wzw action has to be included in the effective model .",
    "however , as we discuss below , the dynamics of elastic scattering and nucleon structure indicate that @xmath3 , @xmath81 , @xmath5 are appropriate effective degrees of freedom in the high energy region just as they are in the low energy region in qhd - ii .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry implemented in the lagrangian ( [ 2.18 ] ) has also been found to be more appropriate to describe properties of finite nuclei , such as charge density , spin - orbit splitting , etc.@xmath91 hence , a relativistic mean field theory based on the lagrangian ( [ 2.18 ] ) with quarks as the basic fermions should be a realistic framework for nuclear matter .    with regard to the gauged nl@xmath4 m ,",
    "elastic scattering analysis supports the conclusion that the nucleon is a topological soliton . in fig.1 , the pion profile function calculated from high energy elastic scattering@xmath110",
    "is compared with the pion profile functions obtained by meissner et al.@xmath112 from low energy considerations .",
    "the profile functions are quite compatible even though they come from two totally different domains of physics .",
    "the gauged nl@xmath4 m , however , completely ignores the scalar field @xmath81 replacing it from the very beginning by its vacuum value @xmath32 and neglecting the important interaction that @xmath81 mediates between left and right quarks .",
    "the only contribution nl@xmath4 m keeps from the fermion sector is the anomalous action arising from the gauge dependence of the fermion measure .",
    "this implies that the soliton of the nl@xmath4 m lies in a noninteracting dirac sea ( fig .",
    "if , on the other hand , we keep the scalar field @xmath81 , assume that replacing it by its vacuum value @xmath113 is reasonable in the pion sector , then in the fermion sector the left and right quarks still interact via the scalar field . in this case",
    ", we have a soliton that lies in an interacting dirac sea ( fig .",
    "what one finds is that , if this scalar field has a critical behavior ( by this i mean it is zero at small distances , but rises sharply at some distance @xmath114 to its vacuum value @xmath32 as in fig .",
    "2c ) , then the interacting dirac sea can have considerably less energy than the noninteracting dirac sea.@xmath115 the system , in this case , makes a phase transition to the interacting ground state and reduces its total energy substantially by the condensation energy .",
    "the phenomenon is analogous to superconductivity .",
    "it also solves a persistent problem of the nl@xmath4 m ; namely , its prediction of a large soliton mass ( @xmath116 mev ) compared to the actual mass ( 939 mev ) of the nucleon .",
    "such a condensation phenomenon implies that the nucleon is a topological soliton embedded in a @xmath14 ground state , and the ground state provides an outer cloud .",
    "high energy elastic scattering analysis , as mentioned earlier , shows evidence of such a cloud that gives rise to diffraction scattering .",
    "a number of other consequences also follow from having a condensed @xmath14 ground state.@xmath110",
    "we have discussed three independent but related developments :          these three developments when combined together strongly suggest that the lagrangian density @xmath117 should provide a very realistic effective theory to investigate density and temperature dependence of nuclear matter over a wide range .",
    "fermions in this effective theory are to be taken as `` quarks '' and not as nucleons .",
    "furthermore , potential energy density @xmath97 of the scalar field should be taken to have a form more general than the higgs potential in ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "this can lead to a physical vacuum at @xmath118 and a metastable or false vacuum at @xmath119.@xmath120 since in mean field theory , meson fields are replaced by their constant vacuum expectation values , and only the fermion field is quantized , it is straightforward to obtain the thermodynamic potential @xmath121 from the grand partition function .",
    "quantities such as energy density , baryon density , and pressure can then be obtained from @xmath121 , and meson field eqautions can also be derived by extremizing it.@xmath122    investigation of high energy elastic scattering dynamics has shown that the scalar - isoscalar field @xmath81 , which is an essential element of quantum hadrodynamics models , plays the crucial role of an order parameter .",
    "its critical behavior leads to a @xmath14 condensed ground state analogous to a superconducting ground state .",
    "furthermore , vector meson @xmath5 behaves as a gauge boson coupled to the topological baryonic charge as in the gauged nonlinear @xmath4-model with wzw action . obviously , the fields @xmath3 , @xmath123 , and @xmath5 , which are appropriate degrees of freedom in the low energy region , also constitute appropriate degrees of freedom at nn c.m .",
    "energies of hundreds of gev .",
    "hence , a relativistic mean field theory based on the lagrangian density ( [ 2.18 ] ) that has these degrees of freedom and quarks as basic fermions should provide a realistic framework to study nuclear matter at high densities and high temperatures  densities and temperatures that will be reached at rhic and lhc .",
    "the pion profile function @xmath144 as a function of @xmath145 in fermi . the continuous curve represents @xmath144 obtained from high energy elastic scattering .",
    "the dotted and the dashed curves represent @xmath144 calculated from low energy in the minimal and in the complete soliton model by meissner et ."
