    "the nuclear collective excitation states have been studied in the framework of nuclear macroscopic and microscopic models .",
    "more detailed descriptions on these models and references can be found in ref .",
    "nowadays , it is still a interesting topic in nuclear physics . with several typical methods , such as the random phase approximation with skyrme interactions@xcite , the relativistic random phase approximation@xcite , the centroid energies and strength distributions of the giant resonances of the nuclei are calculated and compared with the experimental data .    landau fermi liquid theory is one of the important cornerstones of traditional many - body theory in the condensed state physics .",
    "it is very useful because it describes almost all known metals and many non - metallic states , such as superconductors , anti - ferromagnetic states , etc .",
    "however , this theory has not been used to solve nuclear many - body problems successfully . in this work ,",
    "i will try to calculate the collective excitation energies of the nuclear matter within the framework of landau fermi liquid theory , and then compare my calculation results with the experimental data of the nuclear giant resonances of the nuclei .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : boltzmann ] , the formalism on the reduced boltzmann equation is extended to the 3-dimensional of the fermi liquid with the spin taken into account . in section  [",
    "sect : results ] , the calculation results on the nuclear collective excitation energies are compared with the experimental data of the giant resonances of nuclei . the conclusion is summarized in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the boltzmann equation with an infinite quasi - particle lifetime for the nuclear matter can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the occupation number of quasi - nucleons , and @xmath5 denotes the quasi - nucleon energy on the background of a collective excited state .",
    "the quasi - nucleon density @xmath6 and the occupation @xmath7 are related as follows : @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the spin index .",
    "the isospin index is suppressed in eq .",

    "interact with scalar mesons @xmath19 through a yukawa coupling @xmath22 and with neutral vector mesons @xmath20 that couple to the conserved baryon current @xmath23@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density can be written as @xmath24 with @xmath25,@xmath26 and @xmath27 the nucleon , scalar meson and vector meson masses , respectively , and @xmath28 the vector meson field tensor .",
    "the effective nucleon - nucleon potential in the static limit can be deduced directly with the lagrangian in eq .",

    "the fermi liquid function is instantaneous interaction potential between two nucleons near the fermi surface with momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 scattering into two nucleons with same momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which is depicted in fig .",

    "( [ eq : fermifun ] ) is constant and only contribute a ground state energy correction of the nuclear matter . in the framework of the relativistic mean - field approximation or relativistic hartree approximation ,",
    "the nucleon fermi energy can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the summation over spins and isospins of the nucleon , then the nucleon fermi velocity @xmath18 is obtained as @xmath41 where the second term is just the contribution from the direct interaction @xmath42 of the fermi liquid function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermifun ] ) .",
    "thus in the following calculation , only the exchange term is reserved in the fermi liquid function .    the quasi - nucleon density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : liquid - theta - phi ] ) can be expanded in spherical harmonics with time - dependent shape parameters as coefficients : @xmath43 similarly , the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 can also be expanded as @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "therefore , the liquid equation of motion in the basis of spherical harmonics can be rewritten as @xmath48    because the energy spectrum does not depend on the direction of @xmath14 , we can choose @xmath14 to be in the direction of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and then the function @xmath44 becomes @xmath51 in the spherical harmonics , @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54   \\nonumber \\\\ & & y_{l_1,m_1}(\\theta,\\phi)~y^\\ast_{l_2,m_2}(\\theta^{\\prime},\\phi^{\\prime } ) d \\omega d \\omega^{\\prime } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & v^\\ast_f   \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta } \\delta_{l_1,l_2 } \\delta_{m_1,m_2}~-~\\frac{k^2_f}{(2\\pi)^3 } f_f(l_1,m_1;l_2,m_2)\\delta_{\\alpha,\\beta } , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fock term @xmath55 would give a contribution to the nuclear collective excitation when @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the liquid equation of motion of the quasi - nucleon can be rewritten as @xmath58 or the matrix equation form @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 the stability of the fermi liquid requires the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath62 to be positive definite .",
    "hence , all the value of @xmath63 must be less than @xmath64 , and we can write @xmath62 as @xmath65 . letting @xmath66 , then eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrixeq ] ) becomes    @xmath67    where the hamiltonian @xmath68 is hermite and @xmath69 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath70 would give us the frequencies of the collective excitation modes of the nuclear matter .",
    "in this section , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton ] ) for different values of @xmath1 are calculated with the fermi liquid function in the linear @xmath19-@xmath20 model . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton ] ) , quantum number @xmath71 is fixed to zero since our calculation will begin from @xmath72 . the parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite are used in the calculation , i.e. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since the nucleon near the fermi surface would be more possible to be excited , we set the value of nucleon momentum @xmath78 in the calculation .",
    "when @xmath79 , the hamiltonian @xmath70 has a continuous spectrum and it generates the particle - hole continuum of the nuclear matter in the relativistic mean - field approximation .",
    "however , if the value of @xmath80 is large enough , in addition to the continuum eigenvalues , the spectrum of @xmath70 has isolated positive and negative eigenvalues , and the positive isolated eigenvalue corresponds to the energy of the collective excitation of the nuclear matter with fixed @xmath1 .",
    "however , the negative eigenvalue of @xmath70 does not correspond to the negative energy of the nuclear collective excitation modes .",
    "actually , the mode with a positive eigenvalue corresponds to the creation of a nuclear collective excitation mode , while the the mode with a negative eigenvalue corresponds to the annihilation of a nuclear collective excitation mode .",
    "[ fig : e - m ] shows the collective excitation energy @xmath81 in the nuclear matter versus the effective nucleon @xmath82 . in my calculation ,",
    "the nuclear collective excitation energy is relevant to the effective nucleon mass intensely , it can be seen that the collective excitation energy decreases with the effective nucleon mass increasing , and for @xmath83 , when the effective nucleon mass is less than @xmath84 , the isolated eigenvalues of @xmath70 can not be generated .",
    "since the energy of the isospin scalar giant quadrupole resonance of the nucleus @xmath85 is about @xmath86mev@xcite , the effective nucleon mass can be fixed to be @xmath87 , which generates an excitation collective energy of @xmath88mev for @xmath83 . with the effective nucleon energy @xmath87 ,",
    "the collective excitation energies of the nuclear matter for different values of @xmath1 are listed in table  [ tab : e - l ] .",
    "it is apparent that the calculation results are fitted with the experimental values , respectively .    .",
    "the collective excitation energies of the nuclear matter for @xmath89 with the effective nucleon mass @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding experimental values for the excitation energies of @xmath85 are also listed as @xmath90,where the experimental value for @xmath72 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental value for @xmath2 from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the experimental value for @xmath83 from ref .",

    "the method on landau fermi liquid theory in ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to the 3-dimensional fermion system with the spin considered , and then by using the effective lagrangian of the linear @xmath0 model , the fermi liquid function is obtained and the nuclear collective excitation energies of different values of @xmath1 are calculated within the framework of landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "the results shows the nuclear collective excitation energies decrease with the effective nucleon mass and the fermi momentum increasing .",
    "when the effective nucleon mass takes the value of @xmath91 , and the fermi momentum @xmath92 , the calculated collective excitation energies of the nuclear matter for different values of @xmath1 are fitted with the experimental values very well .",
    "in addition , the isoscalar and isovector giant resonances of spherical nuclei are studied within landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "we find the centroid energies of the isoscalar giant resonances just correspond to the positive isolated energy levels of the nuclear collective excitation with different values of @xmath1 , respectively , while the isovector giant resonances except @xmath2 correspond to the modes that protons(neutrons ) are in the creation state of the collective excitation and neutrons(protons ) are in the annihilation state of the same @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , some mixtures of the collective excitation states with different values of @xmath1 , which have higher energies , are predicted .",
