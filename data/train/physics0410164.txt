    "the helicon - wave discharge has been extensively investigated because a high electron density ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) is obtained with comparatively ease under a low gas pressure of a few hundreds mpa [ 1,2 ] , being used as plasma source for applications to material processings [ 3,4 ] , such as etching , plasma chemical vapor deposition , etc .",
    "conventional helicon - wave discharges need strong magnetic fields ( @xmath6 mt ) generated by electromagnets with a measurable amount of power , which has commercially a disadvantage for operating helicon - wave plasma sources with the lower running cost . for the purpose of expanding application fields of the helicon - wave source , it is significant to make the best of an efficient plasma production in a very low magnetic field . in several previous works concerning the mechanism of the plasma production with anomalously high density [ 5 - 7 ] , on the other hand ,",
    "a density increment enhanced by the helicon waves is observed under a weak magnetic field much smaller than the magnetic fields that a mode transition from an inductive - coupled discharge to the helicon - wave discharge appears .",
    "however , the reason why the helicon waves can be excited within narrow range of low magnetic fields has not been exhibited at all .",
    "chen [ 8 ] has recently suggested using a numerical code that the density peak observed in low magnetic fields is caused by an increase in the plasma loading , which is due to the reflection of electromagnetic waves at an endplate near the antenna .",
    "this effect is noticeable only in the case of a loop antenna with the azimuthal mode number @xmath7 , while the density peak is also observed in other experiments using the @xmath8 antennas .",
    "therefore it is required to systematically investigate the density peak mechanism , which leads to the development of the efficient plasma source in low magnetic fields .",
    "+ on the basis of the background mentioned above , we investigate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 helicon wave discharges with low density and low magnetic fields by using three types of @xmath8 rf antennas , a phased multiple helical - antenna ( pmh ) , a half - wavelength helical antenna ( hh ) [ 9 ] , and a double half - turn antenna ( dht ) [ 5 ] . since pmh is possible to excite spatiotemporally - rotating electromagnetic fields with fixing the wave numbers parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field lines in a plasma , the helicon - wave behavior can be clarified even in the magnetic field lower than the threshold field , above which the conventional helicon wave is excited . +",
    "the experiment apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "1 , which consists of an antenna section of a pyrex tube ( 10 cm in diameter and 40 cm in length ) and a measurement section of a stainless chamber ( 26 cm in diameter and 89 cm in length ) .",
    "an endplate is set at @xmath9 cm from the entrance of the measurement section . in order to excite selectively @xmath2 and @xmath3 helicon waves , the phased multiple helical antenna ( pmh )",
    "is used in this experiment .",
    "pmh consists of four elements , each of which is twisted into helix in the left - hand direction along the @xmath10 axis with the antenna length of @xmath11 cm .",
    "an rf signal from a signal generator is divided into two , the phase difference of them is fixed at 90@xmath12 by a phase shifter .",
    "the rf signals driven with 90@xmath12 phase difference are amplified and supplied to two pairs of the antenna elements through the impedance matching circuits , each of which is divided into two branches and transmitted to the opposite terminals of the two elements spaced azimuthally 180@xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , the spatiotemporally - rotating ( circular - polarized ) rf fields with @xmath1 are generated by pmh .",
    "the temporal rotation is fixed in the right - hand direction with respect to the @xmath10 direction . the uniform magnetic field less than 11 mt is produced along the @xmath13 axis by solenoidal coils .",
    "the temporal rotation is fixed in the right - hand direction with respect to the @xmath10 direction , and the change from @xmath14 to @xmath15 is attained by reversing the magnetic field direction from @xmath16 0 to @xmath17 0 .",
    "in addition to pmh , hh ( @xmath11 cm ) and dht are also used as the conventional helicon - wave antennas with @xmath8 , each of which is supplied with the rf power using only one transmission line .",
    "typical operating parameters include the rf frequency of @xmath18 mhz , the rf power of @xmath19 w , and filling argon pressure of @xmath20 pa . plasma parameters and magnetic fluctuations are measured by an axially movable ( @xmath13-axis ) langmuir - probe and a magnetic probe , respectively .",
    "figures 2(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) give the electron densities depending on the magnetic field for the several rf powers using pmh , hh , and dht , respectively . in the case of pmh , the electron density increases with increasing in @xmath21 for @xmath2 , and the density has a peak at @xmath22 mt for 2000 w , where the density attains up to one order of magnitude larger than that at @xmath23 mt , i.e. , icp mode . the peak density becomes higher with increasing in @xmath24 , and @xmath21 yielding the density peak is different between each rf power . on the other hand , the density scarcely increases for @xmath3 , and the peak density is almost one - fifth the magnitude of that for @xmath14",
    ". the density difference for between @xmath2 and @xmath3 becomes small in the case of hh ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , and is not observed in the case of dht as shown in fig .",
    "the reason for the density increment for @xmath25 is that dht concurrently excites @xmath26 fields , and @xmath2 field excited regardless of magnetic - field direction gives rise to the density increment .",
    "since hh includes double half - turn parts at the both ends and excites @xmath26 fields , the density increment is caused in @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , which is larger than that in the case of pmh . + when the @xmath13 component of the magnetic fluctuation @xmath27 is measured in @xmath28 cm ,",
    "waves with large amplitude are observed to propagate toward the downstream .",
    "the radial amplitude profiles of them for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 mt are plotted in figs .",
    "3(a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively . the solid lines of each figure show the fitted curves expressed by composite function of the zeroth and first order bessel functions ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) . in the case of @xmath35",
    "mt , @xmath27 is formed with @xmath34 approximately for both of @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes and the radial position where the amplitude goes to zero is @xmath36 cm obtained from fitted curves , which agrees with the plasma radius determined by the pyrex tube size .",
    "the difference in magnitude between the right and left peaks shows that the wave includes @xmath33 component about 10 @xmath37 , the boundary of which exists at @xmath38 cm , namely , the stailess chamber wall .",
    "the generation mechanism of @xmath33 component is not cleared for the moment . the amplitude for @xmath39 mt ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) is also fitted to @xmath34 bessel function approximately .",
    "the @xmath27 radial profile does nt depend on @xmath21 for @xmath2 , but it is found that the amplitude for @xmath40 mt is not fitted to @xmath34 but @xmath33 in spite of @xmath3 excitation , as shown in fig .",
    "the radial position where the amplitude goes to zero is @xmath38 cm as well as @xmath33 components included slightly in @xmath8 helicon waves .",
    "but the amplitude of the @xmath41 wave for @xmath42 mt is greater than that of @xmath33 components for other cases of figs .",
    "3(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . + the theoretical dispersion relation of the waves is expressed for a cold uniform plasma : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are followed by stix notation [ 10 ] .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the refraction indexes parallel and perpendicular to @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the perpendicular wave number @xmath50 is 58 m@xmath51 calculated from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the dispersion relations of the @xmath2 helicon wave ( @xmath52 vs @xmath21 ) , where closed circles are measured by a b - dot probe and solid line is calculated from @xmath53 depending on @xmath21 for pmh at @xmath54 w ( fig .",
    "the measured dispersion relation is consistent with the theoretical curve of the helicon wave in the range of @xmath16 2 mt , while that differs @xmath55 mt . open circles indicate the maximum amplitude of @xmath27 depending on @xmath21 , which is extremely small in @xmath55 mt .",
    "hence , the discrepancy of the dispersion relation in @xmath55 mt is caused by the influence of antenna near - fields rather than the helicon wave with strong damping .",
    "+ when the electron density and the magnetic field are given , the wavelength allowed to exist in the plasma can be calculated from the dispersion relation .",
    "thus , the relationships between the electron density @xmath53 and the axial wavelength @xmath56 for @xmath57 w are presented in fig .",
    "5 , where @xmath56 is calculated from fig .  2 and eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath58 fixed by the radial boundary as mentioned above .",
    "the electron density becomes high at a specific wavelength , i.e. , @xmath56 = 20 cm ( 40 cm ) for pmh ( hh ) .",
    "those wavelengths correspond with one axial wavelengths of pmh ( @xmath59 ) and hh ( @xmath60 ) , respctively .",
    "therefore the helicon wave is excited strongly in the plasma with the wavelength @xmath56 determined by the electron density and the magnetic field , which becomes comparable to the one wavelength of the antenna . as shown in fig .",
    "5 , on the other hand , we can recognize no clear - cut relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath53 for the dht case , since the electromagnetic field with the fixed wave number of the @xmath13 component is hardly excited by dht .",
    "instead the density is observed to slightly increase around @xmath61 cm corresponding with the axial boundary length , which is considered due to exciting the standing - wave [ 11 ] .",
    "+ in the previous works , the characteristics of @xmath8 helicon wave in an inhomogeneous plasma have been investigated theoretically and experimentally [ 12,13 ] .",
    "krmer suggested that the @xmath3 helicon wave in an inhomogeneous plasma is damped more strongly than that in a homogeneous plasma , and which has a cutoff in a low density region [ 13 ] .",
    "considering gaussian density profiles @xmath62 , the cutoff equation is derived @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the profile width yeilding the density of @xmath65 and @xmath52 is the wave number parallel to @xmath21 , and @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is required in the case where the helicon wave exists in an inhomogeneous plasma . for the @xmath2 and @xmath41 modes ,",
    "@xmath69 is always positive and the wave can propagate in nonuniform plasmas .",
    "however , the @xmath3 helicon wave can only propagate in the higher density region above a critical density .",
    "the critical density curve is theoretically described on the @xmath70 plane using eq.(2 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , where @xmath64 is obtained from the radial density profile measured by the langmuir probe .",
    "@xmath52 is calculated by using eq.([eq1 ] ) and the perpendicular wavenumber is @xmath71 69 m@xmath51 obtained from fig .",
    "@xmath69 is constantly positive ( negative ) in the gray ( white ) zone , which is called propagation ( cutoff ) region .",
    "dots in fig .",
    "6 indicate the electron densities measured , which belong to the propagation region only when @xmath72 mt . it can be said that the @xmath41 helicon wave exists when the background plasma density gets into the cutoff region of @xmath16 5 mt .",
    "in summary , we have clarified a new class of practical aspect of the helicon - wave discharge employing various @xmath8 antennas in magnetic fields much lower than the ordinary magnetic field where the density jump occurs .",
    "it is found that the effective excitation of the helicon wave and the efficient plasma production causally take place even in the very weak magnetic field when the axial wavelength of the phased helical antenna launching spatiotemporally - rotating electromagnetic fields is matched to that of the helicon wave determined by the plasma dispersion relation . the @xmath2 helicon wave propagates in the plasma independent of the magnetic field strength . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath3 helicon wave propagates only in very low magnetic fields where density peaks are observed . the cutoff of @xmath3 helicon wave is theoretically concluded to exist in the region of @xmath73 mt , where the helicon wave propagates with @xmath41 .",
