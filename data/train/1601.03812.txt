    "consider a canonical economic model for a market in which units of a homogeneous , indivisible good are traded among @xmath0 buyers @xmath6 and @xmath1 sellers @xmath7 .",
    "each buyer is interested in purchasing one unit of the good , and each seller has the capacity to produce and sell one unit of the good .",
    "buyers are willing to purchase the good at a price not exceeding their respective reservation valuations @xmath8 that are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables with a common distribution function ( d.f . )  @xmath9 .",
    "sellers are willing to produce at a price that is not less than their respective production costs @xmath10 which are also assumed to be i.i.d .   random variables , with a d.f .",
    "we assume that buyers valuations and sellers costs are independent of each other and call the @xmath12-tuple @xmath13 a realization of the unitary market @xmath14 .",
    "such markets have been studied extensively in the literature on bayesian mechanism design , see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "introductions to mechanism design can be found in ch .  5 of  @xcite or in  @xcite .    within a market",
    ", the welfare generated by trade is defined as the sum of trading buyer valuations less the sum of trading seller costs : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the subsets of buyers and sellers who trade in the market , so that @xmath18 .",
    "market welfare can be thought of as the total gain from trade experienced by market participants .",
    "a market is said to be _ efficient _ if the level of market welfare is always maximised for given buyer valuations and seller costs .",
    "the quantity traded in an efficient market is known in economics as the efficient quantity , the welfare - maximising quantity , or the _",
    "walrasian quantity_. to compute it , order buyer valuations @xmath19 from highest to lowest : @xmath20 } \\geq \\dots \\geq v_{[n]}$ ] , and order seller costs @xmath21 from lowest to highest : @xmath22 .",

    "figure  1 provides an illustration for the quantities  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 .    note that @xmath26 is given by a dependent random sum of random variables and there seems to be no simple way to compute its distribution .",
    "a closed form expression for the distribution of  @xmath26 was given in  @xcite , but it is cumbersome and unsuitable for further analysis . calculating the joint distribution of @xmath27 is an even more difficult problem which is , nonetheless , of significant applied interest , as knowing that distribution ( or at least the covariance of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) is needed to determine the behaviour of quantities such as revenue ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in many applications in economics one also assumes that the market is large , i.e.  both @xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to infinity , and so determining the asymptotic distribution of @xmath27 in such a situation is of substantial interest . in much of the previous mechanism design literature , only the leading term behaviour of the mechanism outcomes was determined ( which is a law of large numbers type result ; e.g.  it was shown that , in large markets , @xmath25 is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath0 times the quantity defined in   below ) and heuristic methods ( which often exploited known order statistics results ) were used to compute the order of magnitude of the error term .",
    "the important problem of a higher order distributional approximation ( of a central limit theorem type ) to @xmath28 has remained so far open .    in this paper , we solve that problem using a strong approximation approach , establishing a normal approximation to the quantities of interest , together with a bound for the approximation rate .",
    "we note that our approach readily extends to the analysis of revenue maximisation mechanisms and constrained optimal mechanisms , through appropriate transformations of the functions  @xmath9 and  @xmath11 ( for the problem formulation , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "now we turn to stating additional assumptions on the model that we will need .",
    "first of all , in our large market setup , the d.f.s @xmath9 and @xmath11 remain fixed and satisfy the following standard mechanism design assumption :    * ( a1 ) *  _ the d.f.s @xmath9 and @xmath11 are absolutely continuous , with respective densities @xmath29 and @xmath30 bounded and bounded away from zero on their respective supports @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] , such that @xmath33 @xmath34 in other words , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . _",

    "likewise , the situation when @xmath60 corresponds to a market with excess supply ( all buyers trade and there is rationing on the supply side of the market ) .    to state the main results , we need some further notation . we will frequently deal with variable scaled functions of the form @xmath61 . for convenience , for @xmath62\\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] we define @xmath63 note that the function @xmath64 @xmath65,$ ] is well - defined for all @xmath66 .    using notation @xmath67 for the inverse of function @xmath68 ( to avoid confusion with the reciprocal  @xmath69 ) , introduce the functions @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and put @xmath71 ( which is well - defined for any @xmath62\\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] with @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 where the right relation holds due to the assumption on @xmath74 from  * ( a2)*.    due to the a.s .  convergence of empirical quantile functions ( e.q.f.s ) to the theoretical ones , for large markets the function @xmath75 approximates the difference between the step - functions whose plots are depicted , respectively , by the dashed and solid lines in figure  1 ( cf .   below ) .",
    "so @xmath76 will be the `` first order approximation '' to  @xmath2 , while the integral of @xmath77 over @xmath78 will specify such deterministic approximation to  @xmath3 .",
    "the  second order approximation \" to both @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be obtained in this paper using the second order approximation to e.q.f.s provided by the sum of the theoretical quantile function and a brownian bridge process .",
    "now observe that , provided that @xmath79 are continuous inside their respective supports , the function @xmath80 is continuously differentiable for @xmath81 , and @xmath82    we will need one more technical assumption on the d.f.s  @xmath9 and  @xmath11 :    * ( a3 ) *  _ the densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 are differentiable on @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",

    "figure  [ figure3_2 ] displays these empirical ellipsoidal quantiles together with the respective ( theoretical ) ellipsoidal quantiles for the approximating distribution of  @xmath107 .",
    "both plots were generated using mathematica  10 .",
    "note that @xmath108 under assumption * ( a2 ) * , so one could state the assertions of the theorem in a similar way using @xmath1 rather than @xmath0 as well .",
    "note also that @xmath109 ( as one would expect , of course ) since @xmath110 and @xmath111    the true rate of convergence of the distribution of @xmath2 to the normal one is most likely @xmath112 , as indicated by the bounds   below established in the special case when  @xmath113 .",
