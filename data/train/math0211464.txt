    "this paper is my humble tribute to the genius of maxim kontsevich . needless to say",
    ", the credit for any new ideas that occur here goes to him , and not me .",
    "for how i got involved in this wonderful project , see the historical note ( [ ss : hn ] ) .    in the papers  , kontsevich defined three lie algebras and related their homology with classical invariants , including the homology of the group of outer automorphisms of a free group and mapping class groups .",
    "he showed this by reducing the homology computation in each case to three graph complexes .",
    "his main theorem can be informally stated as    @xmath0    in this paper , we consider only the first part of this theorem .",
    "the definitions of the lie algebras are motivated by classical symplectic geometry .",
    "kontsevich considered three worlds - commutative , associative and lie .",
    "he developed formal analogues of classical symplectic geometry ( which is the commutative case ) for the associative and lie worlds .",
    "each of the three lie algebras was then defined as hamiltonian functions on a `` symplectic non - commutative manifold '' with the bracket being the analogue of the usual poisson bracket .",
    "the symplectic lie algebra @xmath1 was a lie subalgebra of all three lie algebras .",
    "in the commutative case , kontsevich defined a chain complex using graphs .",
    "the homology of this chain complex is known as graph homology .",
    "he also gave an analogous definition in the associative case using ribbon graphs and in the lie case using more complicated graphs , which one may call lie graphs .",
    "the connection between an algebraic or geometric object like a lie algebra on one side and a combinatorial object like a graph on the other side is the content of kontsevich s theorem . the main tool in proving this connection is to use classical invariant theory of @xmath1 .",
    "from the unified way in which kontsevich treated the three cases , one expected them to be a part of a more general theory .",
    "in fact , in , kontsevich made the following statement .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ our formalism could be extended to the case of `` koszul dual pairs of quadratic operads '' ( see ) including poisson algebras and , probably , operator algebras etc . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this paper arose in an attempt to understand this statement . in mathematics , just as we have the notion of a theorem , proposition , corollary , etc , so should we have the notion of a `` kontsevich sentence '' , the above being a classic example .",
    "earlier we used the term `` world '' to stand for one of the three words - commutative , associative and lie .",
    "a possible mathematical substitute for this term is the word `` operad '' .",
    "it is not possible to develop an analogue of symplectic geometry for every operad .",
    "however , one can do so if the operad is `` reversible '' .",
    "the commutative , associative and lie operads are three examples .",
    "the notion of a reversible operad was developed independently by getzler and kapranov under the name of cyclic operad  .",
    "for some information on the history , see the discussion in ( [ ss : hn ] ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to formulate the first part of kontsevich s theorem in what appears to be its most natural setting - the world of a reversible operad .",
    "to such an operad @xmath2 , we associate a lie algebra @xmath3 and a graph complex @xmath4 and then show that they have the same homology .",
    "a precise statement is given in theorem  [ t : mt ] in section  [ s : mt ] .",
    "we now explain the structure of the paper and give a guide to how readers with different interests and backgrounds can read it .",
    "the two words that dominate the paper are species and operads . these notions are explained in section  [ s : ro ] . in the same section",
    "we define reversible operads . we give plenty of simple examples with stress laid on drawing pictures .",
    "more examples are discussed in sections  [ s : me ] and [ s : gp ] .",
    "we hope that the amount of detail given along with the examples will be sufficient for the reader unfamiliar with these concepts .    in section  [ s :",
    "mf ] , we construct a @xmath5 let @xmath2 be a reversible operad and @xmath6 its image under this functor",
    ". remember that our first goal is to associate a lie algebra and a graph complex to @xmath2 .",
    "the fact is that the mating functor is the main step in constructing these two objects , and the species @xmath6 plays a key role .",
    "so we call these two objects @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , stressing the close connection to the species @xmath6 . the letters @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for algebra and graph respectively .",
    "the subscript @xmath9 refers to the fact that @xmath3 will be defined as a direct limit of a family of lie algebras @xmath10",
    ".    sections  [ s : ro ] and [ s : mf ] , on which we have elaborated so far , form the basic structure on which the rest of the paper is built .",
    "it is a good idea to avoid technical details on a first reading and just keep a few concrete examples in mind .",
    "the rest of the paper can be split into three parts .",
    "part a is about the left hand side of theorem  [ t : mt ] ( lie algebras ) , part b is about the right hand side ( graph homology ) and part c is about stating and proving the theorem .",
    "this deals with symplectic operad geometry .",
    "we start with an overview in section  [ s : sgo ] .",
    "the goal of section  [ s : cm ] is to define the lie algebra @xmath3 .",
    "this is done via a simple pictorial calculus of cuttings and matings .",
    "the lie algebra homology @xmath11 has the structure of a hopf algebra , which we then explain .",
    "this completes the definition of the left hand side of theorem  [ t : mt ] .    in section  [ s :",
    "st ] , we explain kontsevich s symplectic mini - theory .",
    "this is logically not essential to the rest of the paper .",
    "however , it is conceptually the most important section in part a. it shows how the lie structure on @xmath3 emerges naturally from a symplectic form .",
    "this allows us to think of @xmath3 as hamiltonian functions on a `` symplectic operad manifold '' .",
    "this deals with graph homology .",
    "the reader , who is mainly interested in graph homology , can directly start with this part even skipping sections  [ s : ro ] and [ s : mf ] .",
    "we first define a general graph complex @xmath12 and then look at other relevant ( and smaller ) graph complexes , @xmath4 being one of them .",
    "this completes the definition of the right hand side of theorem  [ t : mt ] .",
    "section  [ s : gp ] is optional .",
    "it contains an interesting example of the theory which is based on groups .",
    "in section  [ s : mgh ] , we continue with graph homology and develop some tools that will be used in the proof of the main theorem .",
    "this involves defining a cochain complex @xmath13 , i.e. graph cohomology .",
    "the homology and cohomology are related by an interesting and highly non - trivial pairing on graphs ( [ ss : pg ] ) .",
    "this deals with the connection between symplectic geometry and graph homology .",
    "section  [ s : mt ] contains a precise formulation of the main theorem . to digest the statement completely , the material on lie algebras and graph homology in sections  [ s : cm ] and [ s : gh ] respectively is a prerequisite .",
    "the next three sections deal with the proof of the theorem .",
    "the main ideas of the proof are already present in the commutative case .",
    "since the proof is quite involved , we suggest that the reader specialise to this case on a first reading . the lie algebra @xmath3 in this case is easy to define directly .",
    "so sections  [ s : ro]-[s : me ] are not necessary .",
    "thus the reader , who mainly wants to see the ideas in the proof , may start with part c directly , skipping part a and referring back to part b as necessary .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : mt ] is given in three parts ( sections  [ s : fin],[s : sta ] and  [ s : con ] ) .",
    "in each of these sections , we state and prove a theorem of the form @xmath14 gradually getting closer to our goal . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the main tool in the proof is classical invariant theory of @xmath1 .",
    "this part is done in section  [ s : fin ] .",
    "the second part of the theorem given in section  [ s : sta ] deals with the stability issue @xmath15 and makes strong use of the ideas of section  [ s : mgh ] . in section  [ s :",
    "con ] , we understand the space of primitive elements of the hopf algebra @xmath11 .",
    "this is largely a matter of unwinding definitions and there are no new ideas here .",
    "since hopf algebras play a minor role in this paper , the reader unfamiliar with them may simply omit this section without losing any of the main ideas .",
    "we have included two appendices , which explain how deformation theory relates to the ideas of this paper .",
    "they are not logically essential to the understanding of the main theorem .",
    "appendix  [ ss : dq ] speculates on the deformation quantisation problem for operads in this setting . in appendix  [ ss : dg ] , we show that a certain lie bracket on graph homology defined in   is zero .",
    "this work grew out of a seminar organised by karen vogtmann , devoted to understanding kontsevich s work ( fall 2000 ) .",
    "other participants included d. ciubotaru , f. gerlits , d. brown , j. conant , m. horak , f. schwartz , m. cohen and j. west .",
    "my understanding of kontsevich s ideas , particularly the proof of the commutative case , is due to them .",
    "the material in ( [ ss : og]-[ss : gc ] ) and ( [ ss : lah]-[ss : inv ] ) is based on the seminar notes .",
    "conant and vogtmann are writing an exposition that has some overlap with this .",
    "the notion of a reversible operad and its role in symplectic operad geometry was done in july 2001 ( sections  [ s : ro]-[s : me ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper , namely , defining graph homology for a mated species and theorem  [ t : mt ] , was then relatively easy .",
    "the result in appendix  [ ss : dg ] was proved later in november 2001 .",
    "these ideas , in some form or the other , had already appeared in the works of getzler and kapranov  , ginzburg   and markl  .",
    "being ignorant of the operad literature at that time , this was a gradual discovery for me . in this paper ,",
    "i give my own viewpoint of the subject , which was formed by reading kontsevich .    in",
    ", getzler and kapranov introduced the notion of cyclic operads in order to extend the formalism of cyclic homology for associative algebras   to operad algebras .",
    "this notion coincides with what we call a reversible operad .",
    "for such an operad @xmath2 , they introduced a functor @xmath16 in our notation ( see sections  [ s : sgo ] and [ s : cm ] ) , @xmath17 , and equation   in ( [ ss : fa ] ) can be taken as the definition of @xmath18 .",
    "the mating functor is similar in spirit to @xmath18 , except that we deal with operads and species rather than algebras and vector spaces .    in , ginzburg explained kontsevich s symplectic mini - theory for a cyclic koszul operad .",
    "he denoted the functor @xmath18 by the letter @xmath19 .",
    "since a koszul operad is quadratic , the relations in equation   take the simpler form @xmath20.\\ ] ] these are precisely the relations that kontsevich wrote in  .",
    "elements of associative and lie calculus had appeared earlier in the works of karoubi   and drinfeld  .    however , as we show , to do symplectic geometry , it is sufficient to assume that @xmath2 is reversible , not necessarily koszul or quadratic .",
    "in fact , all the examples in section  [ s : me ] and some earlier ones too are non - quadratic .",
    "we discovered reversibility by requiring that the notion of a partial derivative make sense ( proposition  [ p : pd ] ) .",
    "so in this sense , it is also a necessary condition to do symplectic geometry .    in  , markl considered graph complexes associated to cyclic operads . and",
    "for this , he referred back to the feynman transform construction of getzler and kapranov  .",
    "we conclude the introduction with two remarks .",
    "koszul operads will play an important role in the second part of kontsevich s theorem , which we do not consider here .",
    "if we switch from lie to liebniz algebras   then we will end up with another avatar of graph homology .",
    "now vertices of graphs will have honest labels , unlike in usual graph homology , where vertices are labelled only upto orientation .",
    "in this section , we give a brief introduction to species and operads and then define reversible operads . an excellent exposition on species can be found in the book by bergeron , labelle and leroux  .",
    "the notes by voronov   contain a good review on operads .",
    "a more comprehensive reference is the seminal work of ginzburg and kapranov  .",
    "for some recent developments on operads , see  . for earlier literature , see  , where the concepts of species and operads first originated .      a species @xmath6 is a functor from the category of ( finite sets , bijections ) to the category of ( sets , maps ) .",
    "we denote the image of a set @xmath21 by @xmath22 $ ] and say that @xmath22 $ ] is the set of @xmath6-structures on the set @xmath21 .",
    "the set @xmath23 $ ] will always be empty .",
    "@xmath22 $ ] for @xmath24 + @xmath25 &    =     =      + @xmath26 &    =      + @xmath27 &     + @xmath28 &     + @xmath29 &     +    we now give some examples of species .",
    "the pictures that go along with the examples are shown in the table .",
    "* @xmath30=\\{i\\}$ ] , that is , there is exactly one @xmath25-structure on the set @xmath21 .",
    "there are a variety of ways to show this via pictures .",
    "* @xmath31=$ ] the set of linear orders on the set @xmath21 .",
    "we have shown two pictures for it . * @xmath32=$ ] the set of cyclic orders on the set @xmath21 if @xmath33 and empty otherwise .",
    "* @xmath34=$ ] the set of rooted trees with leaves labelled by elements of the set @xmath21 .",
    "* @xmath35=$ ] the set of trees with leaves labelled by elements of the set @xmath21 if @xmath33 and empty otherwise .    an element of @xmath22 $ ] can be schematically drawn as    @xmath36 \\ \\ \\text{for } \\ \\",
    "i=\\{a , b , c , d\\}.\\ ] ] note that the picture for the species `` @xmath27 '' fits in with this representation perfectly . and the remaining examples can also be made to fit in without difficulty .",
    "for example , the species `` @xmath25 '' can be drawn as @xmath37 and so on for the others too .    a species can be equivalently defined as a sequence @xmath38,q[1],q[2 ] , \\ldots$ ] , where @xmath39 $ ] is a @xmath40 set , where @xmath40 is the symmetric group on @xmath41 letters . here",
    "we have abbreviated our notation so that @xmath39 $ ] stands for @xmath42 $ ] . in the pictures ,",
    "the group @xmath40 acts by permuting the @xmath41 letters .",
    "it is also useful to use a more general definition of species where the target category is replaced by the category of vector spaces . in this case ,",
    "a species is a sequence as above with @xmath39 $ ] being a linear representation of @xmath40 .",
    "it is clear that using vector spaces as the target category is more general because one can go from sets to vector spaces by linearising the representation .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use only sets and vector spaces as the target categories . however , this restriction is mainly for simplicity .",
    "for example , one may consider a species in the category of topological spaces .",
    "it would be a sequence @xmath43,x[1],x[2 ] , \\ldots$ ] of topological spaces with an action of @xmath40 on @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "note that for each of the examples @xmath45 , we suggested a picture with an arrow `` @xmath46 '' drawn in it .",
    "this is possible because these species have the additional structure of an operad .",
    "we begin with an informal discussion on operads .",
    "an operad @xmath2 is a species in which there is a substitution rule .",
    "it can be shown schematically as @xmath47 \\ \\ \\text{for } \\ \\",
    "i=\\{a , b , c , d\\}.\\ ] ] one thinks of @xmath48 as four inputs and the arrow as an output .",
    "the substitution rule allows us to feed the output of one object @xmath49 into the input of another object @xmath50 .",
    "we write this as @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "this can be shown as @xmath53 if we wish to be more specific , we will write @xmath54",
    ". this means that we feed @xmath49 to that input of @xmath50 whose label is @xmath55 .",
    "now we show how the substitution rule works in each of the examples @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath56    @xmath57 for the species @xmath28 , we graft the root of the first tree into the specified leaf of the second tree .",
    "@xmath58 note that there is another way possible .",
    "one could contract the edge at which the grafting took place .",
    "this is what happened for the species `` @xmath25 '' .",
    "there are numerous other variations one can do on this example ; for instance , one could use rooted binary trees .    to give a formal definition ,",
    "an operad @xmath2 is a species with a substitution rule which is    * associative , and * compatible with the morphisms in the source category .",
    "the first condition says that if we perform two substitutions , one after the other , then the order in which we do them does not matter .",
    "the second condition says that substitution commutes with relabelling of the inputs . for more detail on these conditions ,",
    "see the references cited earlier .    for convenience of bookkeeping",
    ", it is useful to label the output as well .",
    "this idea can be formalised as follows . for any operad @xmath2 , define a bi - functor @xmath59 by setting @xmath60=p[i]$ ] , where @xmath61 is a singleton set .",
    "one thinks of an element of @xmath60 $ ] as an element of @xmath62 $ ] whose output is labelled by the element of @xmath61 . for the substitution rule in this situation , we demand that the output label of @xmath49 match the input label of @xmath50 .",
    "so the notation @xmath54 now means that the label of the output of @xmath49 is @xmath55 and it is fed to an input of @xmath50 whose label is again @xmath55 .",
    "just as for species , we can define an operad as a sequence @xmath63 $ ] of @xmath40 modules equipped with a substitution rule that is associative and @xmath40 invariant .",
    "a unit element of @xmath2 is an element of @xmath64 $ ] which when substituted into an input of any @xmath65 $ ] gives back @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that our operads have units and call the unit element @xmath67 . in the second notation , we would write @xmath68 $ ] instead of @xmath63 $ ] and the unit element would lie in @xmath69 $ ] .      we now organise together a basic set of examples .",
    "these include the ones shown in the table ( [ ss : s ] ) .",
    "the motivation for organising them in this manner will become clear when we discuss the mating functor ( [ ss : mf ] ) .",
    "we make two quick remarks .",
    "all examples here are based on sets .",
    "furthermore , the ones that are operads have unit elements and satisfy @xmath64={\\mathbb{q}}$ ] , i.e. @xmath64 $ ] is just the span of the unit element @xmath67 of @xmath2 .",
    "define @xmath71=\\{i\\}$ ] if @xmath21 is a singleton and empty otherwise . and",
    "similarly , put @xmath72=\\{i\\}$ ] if @xmath73 and empty otherwise .",
    "these two examples play a fundamental role in this paper because of their connection to the symplectic lie algebra @xmath1 , see ( [ ss : sl ] ) .",
    "@xmath74      define @xmath30=\\{i\\}$ ] , that is , there is exactly one @xmath25-structure on the set @xmath21 . also define @xmath76=\\{i\\}$ ] if @xmath33 and empty otherwise .",
    "though this is also an operad ( without a unit ) , we call it the commutative species . as far as pictures go",
    ", we will use the one with arrow `` @xmath46 '' for `` @xmath25 '' and the one without it for `` @xmath75 '' .",
    "let @xmath31=$ ] the set of linear orders on the set @xmath21 .",
    "also let @xmath32=$ ] the set of cyclic orders on the set @xmath21 if @xmath33 and empty otherwise .",
    "let @xmath34=$ ] the set of rooted trees with leaves labelled by elements of the set @xmath21 .",
    "for the tree species @xmath29 , we drop the word `` rooted '' . in other words ,",
    "@xmath35=$ ] the set of trees with leaves labelled by elements of the set @xmath21 if @xmath33 and empty otherwise .",
    "since there is no root , one can not define a substitution rule .",
    "the chord species @xmath79 $ ] is the set of chord diagrams on the set @xmath21 .",
    "that is , an element of @xmath79 $ ] specifies a way to pair off the elements of @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , this is non - empty only when the cardinality of @xmath21 is even .",
    "define the chord operad @xmath80 $ ] in the same way , except that one of the chords is left hanging at one end .",
    "hence this is non - empty only when the cardinality of @xmath21 is odd .",
    "the substitution rule should be clear .",
    "the species @xmath81 have no natural substitution rule ; so they are not operads .",
    "we will give some more examples later ( sections  [ s : me ] and [ s : gp ] ) .",
    "an operad @xmath2 is reversible if there is a rule that allows us to switch the output with any given input .",
    "one represents this pictorially as @xmath82 to give a formal definition , for each set @xmath21 and @xmath83 , there exist reversal maps @xmath84 \\to p[i \\setminus \\{x\\ } \\cup \\{y\\},\\{x\\}],\\ ] ] which are subject to two conditions .",
    "we require @xmath85 and @xmath86 it follows from these two relations that the composite of a sequence of reversals is either the identity map or a single reversal .",
    "reversal must be compatible with substitution .",
    "that is , @xmath87 here @xmath55 labels one of the inputs of @xmath50 as well as the output of @xmath49 and @xmath88 labels the output of @xmath50 .    the examples of operads @xmath89 that we gave in ( [ ss : eg ] ) are all reversible .",
    "for each of these examples , there is a picture of the operad that fits in with the schematic one .",
    "the reversal map in all cases then works exactly as shown above in the schematic picture .",
    "we give some intuitive meaning to the conditions on the reversal maps .",
    "condition 1 says that reversal is an external operation .",
    "the internal data of the operad remains unchanged .",
    "condition 2 says that operad substitution commutes with operad reversal .",
    "this will become clearer from the examples of non - reversible operads given in ( [ ss : ne ] ) .",
    "the reversal rules may not be unique .",
    "for example , in ( [ ss : g ] ) , we give two distinct ways to reverse the graph operad .",
    "we now give two examples of operads that are not reversible .",

    "we explain the substitution rule for the operad dias .",
    "there are two cases depending on whether the input into which the substitution occurs is circled or not .",
    "@xmath92 the picture illustrates the second case .",
    "the first case works as follows .",
    "if the input @xmath55 were circled instead of @xmath93 then the result would be a circle on the input @xmath94 .",
    "the substitution rule for perm is similar .",
    "observe that perm and dias are closely related to the commutative ( [ sss : c ] ) and associative ( [ sss : a ] ) operads respectively .",
    "they are binary quadratic and were introduced by loday and his collaborators with motivation from algebraic k - theory  . for other examples of non - reversible operads , see  .",
    "in this section , we introduce the mating functor , which allows us to construct a mated species from a reversible operad .",
    "we then explain the concept of a partial derivative for a mated species ( proposition  [ p : pd ] ) .",
    "this is the most crucial part of the theory and shows exactly how the conditions on the reversal map given in ( [ ss : ro ] ) arise .",

    "each of the @xmath41 @xmath711 s in @xmath730 contributes to one of the @xmath41 edges in the picture .",
    "so there are @xmath729 ways to obtain the same picture . after dividing by @xmath729",
    ", we get every picture exactly once , giving us equation  .",
    "the associativity of the moyal product can be seen from the formula @xmath731 where the picture @xmath2 means that delete all edges and their endpoints and then take disjoint union of what remains .",
    "and @xmath728 is the number of edges that connect a @xmath180 to a @xmath179 .",
    "( the edges go from @xmath169 to @xmath732 , @xmath732 to @xmath181 and @xmath169 to @xmath181 . )",
    "the letters @xmath77 , @xmath733 and @xmath463 refer to the number of connecting edges .      before going to the general case ,",
    "let us do another example .",
    "consider a picture of the form @xmath734 , namely , we have a compact orientable surface ( not necessarily connected ) whose boundary circles are labelled by @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the vector space spanned by such pictures , each picture being a monomial .",
    "the space @xmath7 is a poisson algebra with the commutative product @xmath698 given by disjoint union of pictures and the lie bracket @xmath161 given by @xmath735 where the edge connects a boundary circle labelled @xmath179 in @xmath169 to a boundary circle labelled @xmath180 in @xmath181 or vice - versa .",
    "the picture means that the two boundary circles joined by the edge are glued together to form a single surface . as an example , @xmath736 the deformation quantisation for the poisson algebra @xmath7 is again given by equations   and  .",
    "the picture in equation   means that we glue together the boundary circles that are connected by edges .",
    "there will be a total of @xmath41 gluings .",
    "the associativity of the star product follows from equation  .",
    "we now initiate a general discussion of deformation quantization for operads .",
    "precise definitions are not given ; so this section should be read mainly for the philosophy .    as a candidate for the poisson algebra @xmath7 , take the free algebra over a mated species @xmath6 , which we have previously denoted @xmath159 , see ( [ ss : fa ] ) .",
    "on the geometric side , we are now dealing with a symplectic operad manifold .",
    "the examples in ( [ ss : se ] ) and ( [ ss : ae ] ) correspond to the commutative and surface species respectively .    by our construction ,",
    "the vector space @xmath159 is graded beginning with degree @xmath116 .",
    "for example , @xmath737 are polynomials with no constant or linear terms . also",
    "the monomials in @xmath738 have at least two boundary circles .",
    "however , for the deformation quantization problem , one needs to enlarge @xmath159 suitably by adding stuff in degrees 0 and 1 , as was done for the previous two examples .",
    "we first want to give a poisson structure to @xmath159 and then deform it by the moyal product .",
    "we know that @xmath159 has a lie structure @xmath161 .",
    "this was discussed in ( [ ss : mate ] ) . in terms of pictures ,",
    "it is given by equation  .",
    "the interpretation of the picture is that a mating occurs along the edge .",
    "but what is the commutative structure on @xmath159 ?",
    "we have emphasised that an element of @xmath159 can be represented by a picture .",
    "so take @xmath696 to be the `` disjoint union of pictures '' that represent @xmath169 and @xmath181 .",
    "the implicit assumption is that the species @xmath6 can be written as the exponential of some other species .",
    "this is our proposal for the poisson structure on @xmath159 . from the viewpoint of pictures ,",
    "the compatibility of the commutative and lie products is clear .",
    "next we want to define the moyal product and show that it solves the deformation quantisation problem .",
    "in other words , we want to understand the meaning of @xmath739 for @xmath740 , where @xmath711 is the bi - differential operator defined in ( [ ss : mp ] ) . for @xmath741 , we know that @xmath742 and @xmath720 . writing @xmath743 , where @xmath744 and @xmath745 are @xmath41th order differential operators , we obtain @xmath746 .",
    "one needs to make sense of this .",
    "we first explain how a higher order derivative works by showing it on a schematic example .",
    "@xmath747 thus a @xmath41th order differential operator acting on @xmath169 produces an algebraic object with @xmath41 outputs ( [ ss : prop ] ) .",

    "we write @xmath748 where the picture @xmath2 shows a higher order mating .",
    "there are @xmath41 ideal edges between @xmath169 and @xmath181 each connecting a @xmath179 with a @xmath180 or vice - versa .",
    "and @xmath728 is the number of edges that connect a @xmath180 on @xmath169 to a @xmath179 on @xmath181 . for the definition of an ideal edge , see ( [ ss : mf ] ) .",
    "the examples discussed in section  [ s : me ] have associated props . in those cases ,",
    "we understand the meaning of higher order derivatives , i.e. the right hand side of equation   makes sense . similarly , higher order matings have a natural meaning in those examples .",
    "the example of the surface species was illustrated in ( [ ss : ae ] ) .",
    "the deformation quantisation for the poisson algebra @xmath7 is again given by the formula in equation  .",
    "the moyal @xmath693 product is associative in these cases for the same reason as in the commutative case @xmath312 .",
    "the associativity can be seen from the formula @xmath749 where @xmath728 is the number of ideal edges that connect a @xmath180 to a @xmath179 .",
    "( the edges go from @xmath169 to @xmath732 , @xmath732 to @xmath181 and @xmath169 to @xmath181 . )",
    "the letters @xmath750 stand for the number of edges .",
    "the interested reader can work out the details for the examples based on graphs ( [ ss : g]-[ss : gt ] ) .",
    "another nice example is obtained by exponentiating the associative species .",
    "recall that the chain complex @xmath12 is a differential graded hopf algebra with product @xmath687 given by disjoint union . for a definition of @xmath12 , see section  [ s : gh ] and for the hopf algebra structure , see the remark at the end of section  [ s : con ] .",
    "in addition , recall that we defined another boundary operator @xmath358 on @xmath8 that satisfied @xmath374 , see ( [ ss : finb ] ) .",
    "so @xmath358 induces a map on homology @xmath751 .",

    "h_*(\\mathcal g,\\partial_e)$ ] .",
    "this answers some of the questions raised in  .",
    "the proof is largely a matter of putting together things we already know .",
    "the main step is to use the pairing @xmath452 on @xmath8 and its adjoint property proved in proposition  [ p : ad ] .",
    "the coproduct on @xmath8 is irrelevant to proposition  [ p : triv ] .",
    "so we write the differential algebra @xmath8 as a triple @xmath756 . extending @xmath308 and @xmath687 by @xmath757 $ ] linearity",

    "we now consider another deformation of @xmath8 that is gauge equivalent to this one ( [ ss : ge ] ) .",

    "it was defined by @xmath760 , where the map @xmath452 was induced by a pairing on @xmath8 ( equation ) , while the map @xmath7 scaled a graph @xmath310 by the factor @xmath499 .",
