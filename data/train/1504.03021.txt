    "among the characteristics of real materials , elastic properties are the ones that are crucial from the point of view of various applications . recently , increasing interest is observed in the area of materials with unusual elastic properties - an example are materials with negative poisson s ratio  @xcite . when stretched ( or resp .",
    "compressed ) such materials increase ( resp . decrease ) their size not only in the direction of the stretch ( resp .",
    "compression ) but also in one or more directions transverse to it  @xcite .",
    "materials exhibiting such counterintuitive behavior are known as anti - rubber  @xcite , dilational materials  @xcite or _ auxetics _  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the last name will be used for its brevity .    as for isotropic systems",
    "the poisson s ratio is direction independent , any isotropic material can be either auxetic or not .",
    "for anisotropic systems , which are the subject of the present paper , the situation is more complex .",
    "apart from the alternative that the poisson s ratio is in all directions negative or not , a third possibility exists : in some directions it is negative and in other - it is not . in the literature related to the field , various names have been proposed to describe different situations  @xcite . here",
    "we will adopt the scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which - as in the isotropic case - the names auxetics and nonauxetics correspond , respectively , to negative or nonnegative poisson s ratio in all directions .",
    "materials with poisson s ratios negative in some directions and nonnegative in the other ones will be referred to as _ partially _ auxetic materials or just _",
    "partial auxetics_.    the very existence of auxetics and partial auxetics encourages one to study influence of various micro - level mechanisms on the elastic properties of condensed matter  @xcite .",
    "an important problem in this context is the influence of disorder on the poisson s ratio .",
    "for some two - dimensional ( 2d ) models which are elastically isotropic ( at least for small deformations ) and for some anisotropic 2d models , it has been found that various kinds of disorder ( such as vacancies , interstitials , aperiodicity or polydispersity ) introduced in crystalline structures , increase poisson s ratio  @xcite",
    ". studies of some three - dimensional  ( 3d ) molecular models  @xcite revealed similar effect caused by vacancies , what might suggest a general conclusion that ( at least in simple molecular systems ) disorder weakens or eliminates auxeticity .",
    "recently , however , it has been found that in one of the simplest 3d systems - soft spheres , forming the f.c.c .",
    "phase , there exists a direction in which one of the form of disorder ( polydispersity ) _ decreases _ poisson s ratio , which reaches negative values down to -1  @xcite",
    ". this observation might find practical applications , e.g. in production of partial auxetics of latex meso- or macroscopic spheres for which size polydispersity is easy to control .",
    "unfortunately , the mentioned lowest poisson s ratios were observed only for the softest spheres with @xmath2 , i.e. when the f.c.c .",
    "structure may be unstable with respect to the b.c.c .",
    "structure  @xcite .    taking into account that elastic properties of many - body systems strongly depend on details of the intermolecular interaction potential and , in particular , on the molecular shape , it is interesting to study other 3d systems searching for stable structures for which increasing polydispersity can lead to more negative poisson s ratios in some directions . as it is meaningful to start with the simplest molecular shapes ,",
    "the natural candidate for a first 3d molecule to investigate is a polydisperse dimer .",
    "the aim of this study is to determine the influence of disorder introduced to a solid of soft dimers by the size dispersion of their atoms , on the elastic properties of the model .",
    "the study concerns the zero temperature , @xmath3 , and the number density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the volume and @xmath6 is the number of dimers . at this",
    "density atoms of dimers can be arranged in a perfect f.c.c .",
    "lattice of lattice constant equal to the distance of atomic centers in the dimer .",
    "the dimers form a degenerate crystalline ( dc ) phase - an analogue of that observed in 2d  @xcite .",
    "the phase is characterized by non - periodic positions and orientations of molecules , whereas the atoms forming molecules are arranged in a perfect f.c.c .",
    "lattice ( when the atoms are identical ) or ( for slightly different sizes of atoms ) in a lattice close to the f.c.c .",
    "the dc phase is known to be thermodynamically stable and effectively cubic from the point of view of elastic constants for hard dimers  @xcite and is expected to preserve those properties for soft dimers with short ranged interactions which are studied in the present paper .",
    "the soft dimer system can be seen as a rough model of some man - made nano- , meso- or macro - particle systems , e.g. systems of latex particles  @xcite .",
    "recently , an increasing interest is observed in systems of soft particles  @xcite , especially in the context of physics of colloids .",
    "this is due to the fact that the latter have a broad range of possible applications .",
    "systems of soft polydisperse particles seem to be more realistic models of colloids than those built of identical particles .",
    "polydispersity is also important for nanoparticle crystals  @xcite , where the speed of crystallization and resulting crystal quality is strongly related to size dispersion of particles .",
    "studies of elastic properties of models of polydisperse systems can be thought of as a first step on a path to better understanding mechanisms and phenomena that govern the elastic properties of real systems . such a knowledge is not only important from the point of view of fundamental research but also useful from the material engineering point of view - it can help to engineer materials with desired elastic properties .",
    "the model studied in this work consists of @xmath6 diatomic molecules ( dimers ) in periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dimers are rigid i.e. the distance between centers of the atoms forming each one is constant and equal to @xmath7 ( which constitutes a unit of length ) for each dimer .",
    "initially the atoms form the perfect f.c.c .",
    "lattice and the molecules form a degenerate crystalline ( dc ) phase .",
    "the atoms interact _ via _ purely repulsive potential of the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the diameters of the interacting spheres ( atoms ) , @xmath12 is the distance between their centers and @xmath13 is the energy unit .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is further referred to as the _ hardness parameter _ and its inverse , @xmath14 , as the _ softness parameter_. ( these names come from the observation that when @xmath15 the interaction potential described by eq .  ( [ eqip ] ) tends to the hard - body potential , which is widely used in computer simulations and condensed matter theory  @xcite . ) atomic interactions are assumed to be short - range ones , i.e. only the nearest neighbors ( shearing a face of their voronoi polyhedra ) interact . since the molecules are considered as rigid ,",

[ fg_graphic_structures ] examples of studied structures are presented .",
    "it can be seen that even in the presence of atomic size polydispersity atoms form nearly perfect f.c.c . lattice .",
    "in the following , it will be assumed that the studied system of soft dimers exhibits effective regular symmetry . for the latter symmetry ,",
    "when the external pressure @xmath21 is zero , elastic properties can be described by just three elastic constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite . however , when @xmath25 , it is more convenient  @xcite to use other elastic constants , @xmath26 , obtained by expanding the free enthalpy ( gibbs free energy ) , @xmath27 , with respect to the components of the lagrange strain tensor , @xmath28:@xmath29 @xmath30 in the above equation is the ( helmholtz ) free energy and @xmath31 is the volume of the deformation - free ( reference ) system .",
