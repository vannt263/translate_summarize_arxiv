    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we see that both b and c have faded by approximately 0.1  mag during 2007 .",
    "this suggests that object c is a quasar , as variable blue sources at this magnitude level are typically quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the 800  s exposure was taken with a long slit ( @xmath23 width ) aligned with objects b and c. we used the d560 dichroic with the 400/8500 grating and the 400/3500 grism to achieve a spectral resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "the observations were obtained in non - photometric conditions with poor @xmath25 seeing .",
    "we used the deblending procedure of @xcite in which we assumed gaussian profiles for spatial cross sections to extract independent spectra of the two components .",

    "the subaru focas observation was conducted in @xmath26 on - chip binning mode with the 300b grism and the sy47 filter .",
    "the @xmath27  s exposure was taken in @xmath28 seeing , with a long slit ( @xmath23 width ) aligned across the galaxies g1a , g1b , and g2 .",
    "the spectral resolution with this setup is @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec1029 ] unambiguously shows that component c is a quasar with the same redshift , @xmath30 , as component b. the shapes of the emission and absorption lines are similar .",
    "note in particular similar absorptions in the wings of the ly@xmath31 , , and lines .",
    "these absorption features are probably intrinsic to the quasar and therefore serve as strong evidence that objects b and c are lensed images of the same quasar .",
    "as we expect from the different broad band colors , image c has a redder continuum than image b. a possible explanation is differential extinction , which is relatively common in lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this requires that the two paths have @xmath32 assuming the extinction is caused by dust ( @xmath33 ) at the cluster redshift , @xmath0 .",
    "we subtracted models for images b and c from the keck images and found no nearby galaxies beyond the red arc to the south of image c. another possibility is microlensing by stars in the lens , which can also modify the color of the continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that both dust reddening and microlensing are observed in the other cluster - scale lensed quasar sdss  j1004 + 4112 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the hubble space telescope image of this system also shows no obvious candidate galaxy for the effects . in principle",
    "we can distinguish between these possibilities by examining the differences in the flux ratios between the continuum and the emission lines , because dust will affect both equally while microlensing affects the compact continuum emission region more strongly than the larger broad line regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : spec1029 ] shows no strong difference between continuum and emission line regions .",
    "however , we note a possible small difference in the emission line which suggests that microlensing is affecting this system .",
    "finally , the redshifts of g1a , g1b , and g2 are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively , confirming the estimated cluster redshift of @xmath37 .",
    "however , the velocity difference between g1b and g2 of @xmath38  @xmath39 is so large that the system may be an on - going merger or a superposition of two smaller clusters .",
    "our identification of the third image has several important implications for the mass distribution of the lensing cluster .",
    "there are four possible explanations for image c : ( i ) it is a so - called central core image @xcite of a `` double '' lens system ; ( ii ) it is a `` double '' lens system , but one of the images is split into a pair of images because of external perturbations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( iii ) the lens system is a standard cusp - type `` quadruple '' lens , but the fourth ( counter ) image is too faint to be observed ; and ( iv ) the three images are produced by a naked cusp .",
    "the main problem for ( i ) and ( ii ) is that the models require a large offset between the positions of the brightest cluster galaxies and the center of the lens potential , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lensed arcs seem to contradict these scenarios as their shapes and locations suggest the lens potential is centered near g1 and g2 rather than somewhere between a and b. to test ( iii ) , we searched for any blue objects defined by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 in the uh88 images .",
    "we expect the color cut is conservative as it includes image c which is significantly reddened . except the three confirmed lensed images",
    ", we found no such blue object , to the limiting magnitude of @xmath43 , within @xmath44 of image a. this translates into a constraint on the flux ratio of the putative fourth image d of @xmath45 , which is strong enough to make scenario ( iii ) unlikely .",
    "we also searched for additional variable sources in the monitoring data and found none near the cluster , although with the present data we would not detect variability in a source significantly fainter than the known images .",
    "the remaining scenario , ( iv ) , appears to be a viable solution .",
    "a naked cusp is a rare configuration of caustics in which a tangential caustic extends outside a radial caustic . in the case",
    "that a source is inside a naked cusp , three bright images are created on the same side of the potential center . for definiteness",
    ", we fit the positions of the three images using the _ lensmodel _ package @xcite . we adopt an elliptical @xcite density profile centered on galaxy g1a with a fixed scale of @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the scale radius is degenerate with the estimated mass @xcite .",
    "we assume a positional error of @xmath46 to allow for perturbations from substructures ( e.g. , galaxies ) in the cluster .",
    "this simple model , shown in figure  [ fig : cusp ] , works surprisingly well , with @xmath47 for 1 degree of freedom .",
    "the position angle of the model ( @xmath48 east of north ) is reasonable since it is aligned with the g1-g2 axis and the spatial distribution of color - selected cluster members , and puts the lensed arcs on the major axis of the lens potential as is preferred by ray - tracing in @xmath49-body simulations @xcite .",
    "this model predicts time delays between the ab and bc images of @xmath50  days and @xmath51  days , respectively , assuming a cosmological model of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    a caveat for this model , as in many models of gravitational lenses ,",
    "is the flux ratios of the quasar images . given the image geometry , we would generically expect @xmath54 , while we observe @xmath55 . specifically , our model predicts @xmath56 , whereas the observed flux ratios are @xmath57 in the uh88 @xmath58-band image .",
    "the strong wavelength dependence of the flux ratio between images b and c , which is probably because of dust and/or microlensing , needs to be understood in order to fully evaluate this problem .",
    "we also note that the a / b flux ratio in the 6-cm very large array ( vla ) radio map of @xmath59 @xcite is quite different from the ratio in the optical , @xmath60 . the spatial resolution and",
    "signal - to - noise ratio of the radio map were not sufficient to derive robust radio fluxes for all the three components , and thus additional deep , high - resolution radio images will be essential for understanding the anomalous flux ratios .",
    "in @xcite we were left with a puzzle about sdss  j1029 + 2623 : the observed geometry seemed inconsistent with the observed cluster center .",
    "our discovery here that object c is a third image of the quasar , despite its redder continuum , solves that problem because a three - image cusp lens configuration is easily produced under these circumstances .",
    "the next problem is to understand the flux ratios of the system , both the wavelength dependences and that we observe @xmath61 rather than the expect @xmath54 .",
    "measuring the radio flux ratios will let us separate the effects of substructures in the cluster from extinction and microlensing , and the differences between continuum and emission line , radio flux ratios , and time variability will allow us to separate the effects of extinction and microlensing .",
    "sdss j1029 + 2623 is probably the second naked - cusp quasar lens . among the @xmath62 galaxy - scale lenses ,",
    "only one candidate is known ( apm 08279 + 5255 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "naked cusps require `` marginal lenses '' , in which the lens has a surface density only moderately above the critical surface density required for the production of multiple images ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the cooling of the baryons and the formation of the stellar component of a galaxy provides such high central surface densities that it is nearly impossible for a galaxy to have a naked cusp unless it is an edge - on disk - dominated system ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "group and cluster halos , where the baryons have not cooled yet , are far less efficient lenses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and naked cusp configurations should be far more common . specifically , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) predicted that @xmath63 of cluster - scale lensed quasars will be naked - cusp systems depending on the inner density profile .",
    "we can not seriously measure these fractions at present , given one naked cusp lens and one conventional quadruple lens ( sdss j1004 + 4112 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the existence of even one naked - cusp cluster lens at this stage supports an important prediction of standard cold dark matter halos .    we thank paul schechter for useful discussions , and an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions . this work was supported in part by department of energy contract de - ac02 - 76sf00515 .",
