    "ngc 2175 has historically been of great interest due to both its central location in the perseus cluster , with the perseus cluster being the brightest cluster at x - ray energies ( eg .",

    "these bubbles appear to be spatially coincident with the radio structure extending out from the central agn engine .",

    "we obtain a minimum doppler factor of @xmath82 .",
    "a doppler factor of 2 implies a maximum emission region radius of @xmath83 m or @xmath84 pc , strongly suggesting that the inner region of ngc 1275 is the source of the high - energy @xmath16-ray emission .",
    "we note that a doppler factor of 2 is consistent with those derived for ngc 1275 via independent methods ( eg .",

    "furthermore , @xcite found evidence for hysteresis behaviour in the flux versus photon index parameter space during the april@xmath10may 2009 flare . to investigate whether this hysteresis behaviour is present in the larger flare observed during june@xmath10august 2010",

    "the flux level is clearly correlated with the photon index , such that the photon index becomes harder at higher flux levels ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this ` harder - when - brighter ' behaviour is what one would expect in a simple acceleration and cooling scenario ( @xcite ) and has been observed previously with _",

    "furthermore , a study of the @xmath20 mev properties of tev - bright agn has found that the majority of tev agn exhibit hard spectrum , with @xmath87 ( @xcite ) . at its peak flux , ngc 1275",
    "had a photon index of @xmath88 , hardening from the @xmath89 observed during its ` quiescent ' state .",
    "this would imply that during the flare event , ngc 1275 migrated from a misaligned ibl to a hbl class of agn .",
    "this migration has some interesting implications for detecting ngc 1275 at higher energies .",
    "@xcite suggested that it is the @xmath90 flux that is important when triggering tev observations of _",
    "fermi_-lat sources .",
    "this suggestion appears to be a valid one given that during ngc 1275 s bright flare , when the spectrum was hardest , that is , when the gev @xmath16-ray flux was at its greatest , tev @xmath16-ray emission was detected by the magic cherenkov telescope array ( @xcite ) .",
    "now that three near fr i radio galaxies , cen a , m87 and ngc 1275 , have been detected by both _",
    "fermi_-lat and ground based cherenkov experiments , some preliminary comparisons can be made ( see table [ comparison ] ) .",
    "while the mev / gev flux for ngc 1275 and cen a are similiar , the photon indices are quite different ( @xmath88 compared to @xmath91 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , m87 has a mev / gev flux that is an order of magnitude smaller than both ngc 1275 and cen a , but a photon index that is harder than cen a while being softer than ngc 1275 ( @xcite ) . while there is no obvious correlation between these observational characteristics , it is interesting to note that while m87 and ngc 1275 are known variable sources , cen a does not appear to vary at @xmath20 mev .",
    "all of these fr i radio galaxies have been predicted to be strong sources of mev@xmath10tev @xmath16-rays by a variety of emission models .",
    "one such model attributes the high energy emission to pulsar - like particle acceleration in a rotating magnetosphere around the supermassive black hole and was successfully applied to the variable @xmath16-ray flux of m87 ( @xcite & @xcite ) . in this model",
    "@xmath92 is expected , where @xmath93 is the inverse compton luminosity and @xmath94 is the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass .",
    "for fr i radio galaxies , the inverse compton emission spans the mev@xmath10tev energy range and as such , if the rotating magnetosphere model was applicable to this class of agn , one would expect to see both the mev / gev and tev @xmath16-ray fluxes and luminosities to be correlated to the smbh mass . while this does appear to hold for the flux at tev energies , it does not for the mev / gev flux .",
    "this would imply that the mev / gev and tev emission have origins in different physical processes for radio galaxies .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that fr i radio galaxies occupy a distinct region in the @xmath95 parameter space compared to bl lac objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "this divide is attributed to a difference in accretion rate ( @xcite ) . during the large @xmath16-ray flare presented in this paper ,",
    "ngc 1275 migrated from the fr i radio galaxy to the bl lac region of the @xmath95 parameter space with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "if indeed , the difference in @xmath95 parameter space is due to accretion rate , then the ngc 1275 s flaring events of june@xmath10august 2010 could possibly be associated with an increase in accretion , and associated increase in the matter ejected along the relativistic jets .",

    "<S> we report on our study of the high - energy @xmath0ray emission from the fr i radio galaxy ngc 1275 , based on two years of observations with the _ fermi_-lat detector . </S>",
    "<S> previous _ </S>",
    "<S> fermi _ studies of ngc 1275 had found evidence for spectral and flux variability on monthly timescales during the first year of _ fermi_-lat observations . </S>",
    "<S> this variability is also seen in the larger two year data set , during which we observe a large @xmath0ray flare ( june - august 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increased photon statistics from this large flare have allowed the discovery of flux variability from ngc 1275 on the timescales of days . </S>",
    "<S> the largest flux variation observed during this flare being a factor of @xmath1 from one day to the next and a resultant @xmath2-folding risetime of @xmath3 days . </S>",
    "<S> the two year averaged @xmath4100 mev @xmath0ray spectrum is adequately described by a power - law spectrum , with a photon index , @xmath5 , of @xmath6 , and a resultant integrated flux of @xmath7 ph @xmath8s@xmath9 . while no hysteresis was observed in the photon index@xmath10flux ( @xmath11 vs f@xmath12 ) parameter space , there was obvious ` harder - when - brighter ' behaviour observed during the large @xmath0ray flare . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , during this large flare , ngc 1275 appeared to migrate from the fr i radio galaxy to the bl lac object region of the photon index@xmath10luminosity ( @xmath11 vs l@xmath12 ) paramater space . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present details of our _ fermi_-lat analysis of ngc 1275 , including a brief discussion on its implications for @xmath0ray blazar sources .    </S>",
