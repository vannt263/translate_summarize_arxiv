    "recently , determination of the dynamical properties of physical systems with nontrivial geometry has attracted a growing interest because of their wide applicability in various physical and biophysical problems .",
    "examples are biological macromolecules , nanotubes , microtubules , vesicles , electronic and photonic wave - guide structures @xcite ; the gene transcription is usually accompanied by a local dna bending @xcite ; the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes drastically depend on their chirality @xcite ; t - shape junctions were recently proposed @xcite as nanoscale metal - semiconductor - metal contact devices ; periodically spaced , curved optical waveguides were proposed for observation of optical bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "the geometry manifests itself in particular in creation of linear quasi - bound states ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion provides an existence of spatially localized soliton - like excitations .",
    "taken together these two localization mechanisms compete and one may expect that the _ interplay of geometry and nonlinearity can lead to qualitatively new effects_.    an example of nonlinearity - induced change of the geometry of the system can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the classical heisenberg model on an infinite elastic cylinder was considered .",
    "it was shown that a periodic topological spin soliton induces a periodic pinch of the cylindrical manifold .",
    "these results are applicable to microtubules and vesicles comprised of magnetic organic materials @xcite .",
    "the stationary lasing of the modes in a microdisk was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that nonlinear whispering gallery modes exist in the microdisk above some finite pumping thresholds .",
    "in this paper we consider a curved chain of nonlinear oscillators which is described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model with the coupling coefficients depending on the distance between oscillators .",
    "this model has been in particular used as an approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of biological macromolecules , such as proteins @xcite and dna @xcite .",
    "it was shown that nonlinear excitations should play a key part in the biological functioning of such molecular chains .",
    "however , usually they are investigated on the assumption that the chain has straight rod - like configuration .",
    "on the other hand , thermodynamical properties of these macromolecules can not be understood without taking into account their flexibility and existence of non - trivial spatial configurations .",
    "moreover , there is increasing evidence that non - trivial spatial configurations should play a part in nonlinear dynamics of the macromolecules .",
    "in particular , the dna molecule is usually hooked @xcite by the rna - polymerase which binds to the promoter segment of dna and then initiates the dna transcription .",
    "this raises the interesting question of whether a non - trivial spatial configuration of the chain could introduce some new qualitative effects into the nonlinear dynamics of the system ? in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate some of such effects on the example of the chain with a single parabolic bending . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the model and present the results of numerical calculations of stationary excitations . in particular , we discuss the multistability phenomenon and curvature - induced symmetry breaking in the spectrum of nonlinear excitations . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze analytically a minimal model which gives qualitatively the same behavior as the original model . in sec .",
    "4 we consider dynamical properties of nonlinear excitations , in particular scattering of the moving excitations by the chain bending .",
    "section 5 presents the concluding discussion .",
    "and mass @xmath0 , created by the bending.,width=245 ]    the model we study is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the complex amplitude at the site @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ,  ) .",
    "for instance in the case of the two - strand dna model @xcite , @xmath5 is the complex amplitude of the base - pair stretching vibration .",
    "we assume that the excitation transfer @xmath6 in the dispersive term depends on the distance in the embedding space between the sites @xmath3 and @xmath0 : @xmath7 , where the radius - vector @xmath8 characterizes spatial position of the site @xmath3 .",
    "of course , when @xmath9 models electromagnetic coupling between dipoles , this coefficient will depend also on the relative angles .",
    "however , in some cases such dependence is not present .",
    "e.g. , for the semiflexible ribbon polymers @xcite the dipoles are orthogonal to the plane in which the chain can be curved , so that the corresponding interaction would depend only on the distance between the dipoles .    from the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "we obtain the equation of motion in the form @xmath10 the hamiltonian @xmath11 and the number of excitations ( quanta ) @xmath12 are both conserved quantities .",
    "the sites are assumed to be equidistantly placed on a planar envelope curve .",
    "we consider the properties of nonlinear excitations in the vicinity of the bends where the envelope curve can be modeled by a parabola ( see the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] ) : @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the inverse radius of curvature at the bending point .",
    "we assume that the chain is inextensible that is the distance between neighboring sites is constant : @xmath16 for all @xmath3 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath15 is not too large ( @xmath17 for all @xmath18 ) the excitation dynamics does not depend on the curvature of the system in the _ nearest - neighbor approximation _",
    ", when @xmath19 .     and",
    "localized linear bound states emerge above ( symmetric states ) and below ( antisymmetric states ) the continuum spectrum of extended states.,width=377 ]     for @xmath21.,width=377 ]    in many physical problems , however , the nearest - neighbor approximation is too crude .",
    "for example , effective dispersive interaction between nonlinear layers in nonlinear dielectric superlattices is exponential , @xmath22 , with the inverse radius @xmath23 depending on parameters of the lattice ( superlattice spacing , linear refractive index and so on ) @xcite . in the framework of the peyrard - bishop model @xcite the nonlinear dynamics of the dna molecule",
    "can be described by eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) with nonlinear term of the opposite sign ( because of the _ repulsive _ anharmonicity ) . in this case",
    "@xmath5 is the complex amplitude of the base - pair stretching vibration @xcite .",
    "the base - pairs ( at , gc ) in the dna molecule are usually asymmetric ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and therefore the vibration which corresponds to the stretching of the hydrogen bonds connecting the two bases , transfers along the chain due to the dipole - dipole interaction decaying with the distance @xmath24 as @xmath25 . since the dipole moments of base - pairs are almost perpendicular to the molecular axis @xcite , they are almost parallel to each other and the interaction between dipoles is also repulsive ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , after substitutions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , this model of the dna molecule will be described by eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) .",
    "we have investigated both cases , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with qualitatively the same results . in this paper , however , we discuss only the first case in detail .",
    "it is known @xcite that in the case of straight rod - like chain ( @xmath31 ) such nls model exhibits bistability in the spectrum of nonlinear stationary states for @xmath32 . to distinguish these effects from the finite curvature effects we use @xmath33 in what follows .    for stationary states , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the nonlinear frequency and @xmath36 is the excitation amplitude of the @xmath3-th site , eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) reduces to the system of nonlinear algebraic equations @xmath37 which can be solved , for instance , by the newton - raphson iterations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin - spect ] we demonstrate that in the linear limit , i.e. when the term @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - nls - stat ] ) is neglected , the bending creates at least one linear localized state .",
    "the profile of the first bound state , which is always present , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin - modes]a . when the curvature of the chain increases , new localized states are emerged from the continuum spectrum ; their profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin - modes ] . as it has been recently proven for another but similar system @xcite",
    ", the number of these bound states can exceed any positive integer provided the chain is curved `` enough '' .",
    "however , in the present paper we shall study the case of smooth bendings for which only the first bound state is present . in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] we plot the dependence of @xmath39 obtained numerically for both , the straight rod - like and curved chains .",
    "as may be inferred from this figure , several new features arise as a consequence of the finite curvature .     for the straight chain ( @xmath31 ; _ dot - dashed line _ ) and curved chain ( @xmath40 ; _ solid lines _ for stable states , _ dashed lines _ for the states unstable with respect to the breathing mode , and _ dotted line _ for the states unstable with respect to the peierls mode ) for @xmath33 and @xmath20 . in the inset shapes of the symmetric ( s ) and asymmetric ( as ) stationary states for @xmath41 are shown.,width=377 ]     for @xmath33 , @xmath20 , and @xmath42.,width=302 ]    specifically , _ there appears a gap _ at small @xmath35 in which no localized solution can exist . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lin - spect ] , this gap originates from the existence of the linear two - hump bound state discussed above .    in the case of curved chain",
    "there are _ two branches of stationary states _ : a branch of symmetric localized excitations ( s ) , which exists for all values of @xmath43 , and a branch of _ asymmetric localized excitations _ ( as ) , which exists only for @xmath44 .",
    "the threshold value @xmath45 decreases when @xmath15 decreases and vanishes in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "the symmetric stationary state has a two - humped shape ( evolved from the linear two - hump localized mode ) while in the asymmetric state the maximum is shifted either to the left or to the right from the center of symmetry @xmath47 ( see inset in fig . [",
    "fig : norm ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of straight rod - like chain ( see dot - dashed line in fig . [",
    "fig : norm ] ) , the dependence @xmath39 for the symmetric stationary states in curved chain is _ non - monotonic_. that is , there exist an interval of @xmath43 in which three different symmetric states coexist for each excitation number ; two of them are usually stable @xcite .",
    "such bistability phenomenon exists in the straight rod - like chain only for smaller values of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the bending of the chain facilitates the _ bistability of nonlinear excitations_.    the energy of the symmetric as well as asymmetric localized states is monotonically decreasing function of the curvature ( see fig . [",
    "fig : energy ] ) .",
    "thus , one may expect that the _ nonlinear localized excitation may facilitate bending of flexible molecular chain_. for @xmath44 , when symmetric and asymmetric stationary states coexist , the _ asymmetric state is always energetically more favorable_. taking into account that in the linear limit the ground state of the model is symmetric with respect to the center of symmetry @xmath47 one can conclude that _ combined action of the finite curvature and nonlinearity provides the symmetry breaking _ in the system .",
    "apart from the smooth bending we studied the case of the wedge : @xmath49 , and obtained qualitatively the same results .",
    "we checked also that the exact form of the dispersive interaction is not of serious concern here . to this end",
    "we studied the case when the dispersive interaction has the power dependence on the distance : @xmath30 .",
    "qualitatively the same results were obtained for this case , too .",
    "the symmetry breaking , which we observe , means that there is a bistability in the spectrum of nonlinear excitations : the excitation can be localized either to the left or to the right of the bending . by applying an external periodic field",
    "one can achieve switching between these two states . in this way we may expect a new resonance to appear in the response of the system to a periodic driving .",
    "to gain a better insight into the symmetry breaking mechanism , let us consider the continuum limit of the discrete nls model given by eqs .",
    "( [ ham])([nls ] ) .",
    "we are interested here in the case when the characteristic size of the excitation is much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "it permits us to replace @xmath2 by the function @xmath50 of the arclength @xmath51 which is the continuum analogue of @xmath3 . using the euler - mclaurin summation formula @xcite we get @xmath52 here",
    "@xmath53 is the inverse effective mass of the excitation , and @xmath54 is the energy shift due to the dispersive interaction . near the bending point",
    "the number of neighbors available for excitation is larger than far away where the curvature is small . near the bending the effective potential , @xmath55 ,",
    "exhibits a double - well shape .",
    "this fact together with the resulting double - well spatial dependence of the effective mass , @xmath56 , are the reasons why the excitation is localized .",
    "the attractive potential @xmath55 consists of two symmetric wells whose positions ( @xmath57 ) and depths ( @xmath58 ) are determined by the range of the dispersive interaction and the peculiarities of the bending geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] ) .",
    "e.g. , in the case of the wedge , @xmath59 , we get for @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the modified bessel function @xcite .",
    "the distance between the potential minima @xmath63 and their depth @xmath64 increase when the wedge angle @xmath65 .",
    "note that the hamiltonian similar to eq .",
    "( [ hamc ] ) with @xmath66 was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the effects of the dna bending on breather trapping .",
    "the step function dependence of the effective mass @xmath56 was there assumed .     for symmetric ( s ) and asymmetric ( as ) nonlinear excitations in the two - impurity minimal model ( [ toy ] ) with @xmath67 and @xmath68.,width=377 ]",
    "the nls model ( [ hamc ] ) is still very difficult to solve analytically .",
    "but it is interesting anyway to find a model  chosen as simple as possible  which gives qualitatively the same results as the original model .",
    "such a model can be obtained by using step - wise approximation @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the heaviside step - function , @xmath71 is the width of the potential well .",
    "the similar expression can be written for the effective mass @xmath56 . in the step - wise approach",
    "the stationary equation which corresponds to the hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) can be solved and the corresponding eigenvalue problem can be explored .",
    "however , results obtained in this manner look very cumbersome .",
    "therefore we shall make a further simplification by applying the limit @xmath72 , keeping the product @xmath73 constant in eq .",
    "( [ stp ] ) . in this way",
    "we arrive at the following minimal model @xmath74 where the gauge - transformation @xmath75 was used . introducing into eq .",
    "( [ toy ] ) the stationary state ansatz @xmath76 where @xmath77 when @xmath78 , we find that @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the jacobi elliptic functions with the modulus @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath0 are determined from the relations @xmath82 where @xmath83 . using the above expressions one can evaluate the number of excitations which corresponds to the stationary solution @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the amplitude and @xmath86 is the elliptic integral of the second kind @xcite .",
    "the equation @xmath87 always has a solution @xmath88 .",
    "this corresponds to the symmetric two - hump wave function @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , @xmath90 solutions appear for @xmath91 with the threshold value @xmath92 being determined from the condition @xmath93 for @xmath94 . in other words , a symmetry - breaking bifurcation to a doubly degenerate branch of asymmetric solutions occurs in the point @xmath95 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) that the symmetry - breaking bifurcation is determined by the equation @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "the results of the analytical consideration of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem based on eqs .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ numb ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy ] . as in the original model the stationary state ( s ) is unique and symmetric for small number of quanta @xmath43 .",
    "but when the number of quanta exceeds some critical value there are two stationary states : symmetric ( s ) and asymmetric ( as ) , with the asymmetric state being energetically favorable .",
    "thus , similarly to the original model , the minimal model demonstrates a symmetry breaking effect ( localization in one of the wells ) .",
    "it is worth noting that a closely related phenomenon was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where nonlinear electromagnetic waves in a symmetric planar waveguide were studied .",

    "the first issue has been considered in details in ref .",

    "[ fig : dynamics ] .",
    "one can see that the two - humped initial symmetric state evolves into an asymmetric state with an excited breathing internal mode .    in this paper",
    "we consider in more details another item which is very intriguing from the viewpoint of possible applications : the scattering of moving excitations in their passage through the center of the bending . to accomplish it",

    "2 . eventually , evolving over the course of 5000 time units , the excitation reached almost stationary form . substituting it into the curved chain far away from the bending , we found out that the destiny of the excitation in passing though the bending region is strongly dependent on the curvature @xmath15 of the chain .     which demonstrates scattering of the moving excitation from fig .",
