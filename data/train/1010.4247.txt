    "centrality measures the degree to which network structure contributes to the importance , or status , of a node in a network .",
    "over the years many different centrality metrics have been defined .",
    "one of the more popular metrics , betweenness centrality  @xcite , measures the fraction of all shortest paths in a network that pass through a given node .",
    "other centrality metrics include those based on random walks  @xcite and path - based metrics .",
    "the simplest path - based metric , degree centrality , measures the number of edges that connect a node to others in a network . according to this measure ,",
    "the most important nodes are those that have the most connections . however , a node s centrality depends not only on how many others it is connected to but also on the centralities of those nodes  @xcite .",
    "this measure is captured by the total number of paths linking a node to other nodes in a network .",
    "one such metric , @xmath0-centrality  @xcite , measures the total number of paths from a node , exponentially attenuated by their length . the attenuation parameter sets the length scale of interactions . unlike other centrality metrics , which do not distinguish between local and global structure",
    ", a parameterized centrality metric can differentiate between locally connected nodes , i.e. , nodes that are linked to other nodes which are themselves interconnected , and globally connected nodes that link and mediate communication between poorly connected groups of nodes .",
    "studies of human  @xcite and animal  @xcite populations suggest that such ` bridges ' or ` brokers ' play a crucial role in the information flow and cohesiveness of the entire group .",
    "one difficulty in applying @xmath0-centrality in network analysis is that its key parameter is bounded by the spectrum of the corresponding adjacency matrix of the network . as a result ,",
    "the metric diverges for larger values of this parameter .",
    "we address this problem by defining _",
    "normalized @xmath0-centrality_. we show that the new metric avoids the problem of bounded parameters while retaining the desirable characteristics of @xmath0-centrality , namely its ability to differentiate between local and global structures .",
    "in addition to ranking nodes , parameterized centrality can be used to identify communities within a network  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize modularity maximization - based approach  @xcite to use normalized @xmath0-centrality . rather than find regions of the network that have greater than expected number of edges connecting nodes  @xcite",
    ", our approach looks for regions that have greater than expected number of weighted paths connecting nodes .",
    "one advantage of this method is that the attenuation parameter can be varied to identify local vs.   global communities .",
    "normalized @xmath0-centrality is a powerful tool for network analysis . by differentiating between locally and globally connected nodes , it provides a simple alternative to previous attempts to quantify fine - grained structure of complex networks , such as the motif - based  @xcite and role - based  @xcite descriptions .",
    "the former measures the relative abundance of subgraphs of a certain type , while latter classifies nodes according to their connectivity within and outside of their community . applying either of these descriptions to real networks is computationally expensive : role - based analysis , for example , requires the network to be decomposed into distinct communities first .",
    "normalized @xmath0-centrality , on the other hand , measures node connectivity at different length scales , allowing us to resolve network structure in a computationally efficient manner",
    ".    we use normalized @xmath0-centrality to study the structure of several benchmark networks , as well as a real - world online social network .",
    "we show that this parameterized centrality metric can identify locally and globally important nodes and communities , leading to a more nuanced understanding of network structure .",
    "bonacich  @xcite defined _ @xmath0-centrality _ @xmath1 as the total number of attenuated paths between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath0 giving the attenuation factors . in communication and information networks",
    "we are considering , @xmath5 . ] along direct edges ( from @xmath2 ) and indirect edges ( from intermediate nodes ) in the path from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , respectively , and @xmath6 is the length of the longest path . given the adjacency matrix of the network @xmath7 , @xmath0-centrality matrix is defined as follows : @xmath8 the first term gives the number of paths of length one ( edges ) from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , the second gives the number of paths of length two , etc .",
    "although @xmath9 along different edges in a path could in principle be different , for simplicity , we take them all to be equal : @xmath10 . in this case , the series converges to @xmath11 , which holds while @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the largest characteristic root of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the computation of @xmath13 is difficult , especially for large networks , which include most complex real - world networks .    to get around this difficulty",
    ", we define _ normalized @xmath0-centrality _ matrix as : @xmath14 as we show in the appendix , in contrast to @xmath0-centrality , normalized @xmath0-centrality is not bounded by @xmath13 .",
    "also , we prove that , assuming @xmath15 is strictly greater than any other eigenvalue , @xmath16 exists ; and as @xmath0 is increased , @xmath17 converges to this value and is finite for @xmath18 .    just like the original @xmath0-centrality , normalized @xmath0-centrality contains a tunable parameter @xmath0 that sets the length scale of interactions . for @xmath19 , ( normalized",
    ") @xmath0-centrality takes into account direct edges only . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", @xmath17 becomes a more global measure , taking into account ever larger network components .",
    "the expected length of a path , the radius of centrality , is @xmath20 .",
    "much of the analysis done by social scientists considered local structure , i.e. , the number  @xcite and nature  @xcite of an individual s ties . by focusing on local structure , however , traditional theories fail to take into account the macroscopic structure of the network .",
    "many metrics proposed and studied over the years deal with this shortcoming , including pagerank  @xcite and random walk centrality  @xcite .",
    "these metrics aim to identify nodes that are ` close ' in some sense to other nodes in the network , and are therefore , more important .",
    "pagerank , for example , gives the probability that a random walk initiated at node @xmath2 will reach @xmath3 , while random - walk centrality computes the number of times a node @xmath2 will be visited by walks from all pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "normalized @xmath0-centrality , @xmath21 , also measures how ` close ' node @xmath2 is to other nodes in a network and can be used to rank the nodes accordingly .",
    "the presence of a tunable parameter turns normalized @xmath0-centrality into a powerful tool for studying network structure and allows us to seamlessly connect the rankings produced by well - known local and global centrality metrics . for @xmath19 ,",
    "normalized @xmath0-centrality takes into account local interactions that are mediated by direct edges only , and therefore , reduces to _ degree centrality_. as @xmath0 increases and longer range interactions become more important , nodes that are connected by longer paths grow in importance . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the rankings produced by normalized @xmath0-centrality are equivalent to those produced by @xmath0-centrality .",
    "also as shown in the appendix , for symmetric matrices , as @xmath23 , normalized @xmath0-centrality converges to _ eigenvector centrality _  @xcite .",
    "the rankings no longer change as @xmath0 increases further , since @xmath0 has reached some fundamental length scale of the network .",
    "girvan & newman  @xcite proposed _ modularity _ as a metric for evaluating community structure of a network .",
    "the modularity - optimization class of community detection algorithms  @xcite finds a network division that maximizes the modularity , which is defined as @xmath24 ( connectivity within community)-(expected connectivity ) , where connectivity is measured by the density of edges .",
    "we extend this definition to use normalized @xmath0-centrality as the measure of network connectivity . according to this definition , in the best division of a network ,",
    "there are more weighted paths connecting nodes to others within their own community than to nodes in other communities .",
    "modularity can , therefore , be written as : @xmath25\\delta(s_i , s_j)}\\ ] ] @xmath26 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : inf1 ] ) . since @xmath4 factors out of modularity , without loss of generality we take @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath0 can be varied from 0 to 1 .",
    "@xmath28 is the expected normalized @xmath0-centrality , and @xmath29 is the index of the community @xmath2 belongs to , with @xmath30 if @xmath31 ; otherwise , @xmath32 .",
    "we round the values of @xmath33 to the nearest integer .",
    "to compute @xmath34 , we consider a graph , referred to as the null model , which has the same number of nodes and edges as the original graph , but in which the edges are placed at random . to make the derivation below more intuitive , instead of normalized @xmath0-centrality , we talk of the number of attenuated paths . in normalized @xmath0-centrality",
    ", the number of attenuated paths is scaled by a constant , hence the derivation below holds true .",
    "when all the nodes are placed in a single group , then axiomatically , @xmath35 .",
    "therefore @xmath36 = 0 $ ] , and we set @xmath37 therefore , according to the argument above , the total number of paths between nodes in the null model @xmath38 is equal to the total number of paths in the original graph , @xmath39 .",
    "we further restrict the choice of null model to one where the expected number of paths reaching node @xmath3 , @xmath40 , is equal to the actual number of paths reaching the corresponding node in the original graph .",
    "similarly , we also assume that in the null model , the expected number of paths originating at node @xmath2 , @xmath42 , is equal to the actual number of paths originating at the corresponding node in the original graph @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath42 and @xmath40 are then rounded to the nearest integers .",
    "next , we reduce the original graph @xmath45 to a new graph @xmath46 that has the same number of nodes as @xmath45 and total number of edges @xmath44 , such that each edge has weight 1 and the number of edges between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath46 is @xmath47 . now",
    "the expected number of paths between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in graph @xmath45 could be taken as the expected number of the edges between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 in graph @xmath46 and the actual number of paths between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 in graph @xmath45 can be taken as the actual number of edges between node @xmath2 and node @xmath3 in graph @xmath46 .",
    "the equivalent random graph @xmath48 is used to find the _ expected _ number of edges from node @xmath2 to node @xmath3 . in this graph",
    "the edges are placed in random subject to constraints : ( _ i _ ) the total number of edges in @xmath48 is @xmath44 ; ( _ ii _ ) the out - degree of node @xmath2 in @xmath48 = out - degree of node @xmath2 in @xmath49 ; ( _ iii _ ) the in - degree of a node @xmath3 in graph @xmath48 = in - degree of node @xmath3 in graph @xmath50 . thus in @xmath48",
    "the probability that an edge will emanate from a particular node depends only on the out - degree of that node ; the probability that an edge is incident on a particular node depends only on the in - degree of that node ; and the probabilities of the two nodes being the two ends of a single edge are independent of each other . in this case , the probability that an edge exists from @xmath2 to @xmath3 is given by _",
    "edge in @xmath51 emanates from i _ @xmath52 _ _ edge in @xmath51 incident on j__=@xmath53 . since the total number of edges is @xmath44 in @xmath48 , therefore the expected number of edges between @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "is @xmath54 , the expected the expected @xmath0 centrality in @xmath45 .",

    "@xcite have shown that the decision version of modularity maximization is np - complete . like others  @xcite",
    ", we use the leading eigenvector method to obtain an approximate solution . in this method",
    ", nodes are assigned to either of two groups based on a single eigenvector corresponding to the largest positive eigenvalue of the modularity matrix .",
    "this process is repeated for each group until modularity does not increase further upon division .",

    "several path - based centrality metrics can be expressed in terms of @xmath61 , including random walk models  @xcite , degree centrality , katz score  @xcite , as well as @xmath0-centrality . in a random walk model ,",

    "@xmath0-centrality holds for @xmath78 ( @xmath13 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , as shown in the appendix , normalized @xmath0-centrality holds for all values of @xmath0 . *",
    "when @xmath79 , this in turn reduces to the katz status score  @xcite . *",

    "experimentally we have observed , that this method reaches convergence very quickly . considering a network with @xmath89 nodes and @xmath90 links , each iteration of this algorithm ( for a given value of @xmath0 ) has a runtime complexity of @xmath91 and space complexity of @xmath92 .    in order to study variation in this metric for @xmath93 , we must choose a step size of order @xmath94 , since by the gershgorin circle theorem , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the maximum out- and in - degree of the network respectively .",
    "since the formulation of normalized @xmath0-centrality is very similar to that of pagerank , similar block based strategies can be used for fast and efficient computation of both pagerank and @xmath17  @xcite . like pagerank , normalized @xmath0-centrality",

    "the case @xmath19 corresponds to edge - based modularity method .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the number of groups discovered in all networks goes down , while their purity increases .",
    "this is consistent with our hypothesis that using smaller values of @xmath0 allows us to identify more local network structure , while larger values of @xmath0 lead to more global structure . in the karate club network , for example , at @xmath19 , there are four small communities , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : karate](a ) .",
    "these local communities coalesce into two large groups as @xmath0 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : karate](c ) ) , which are identical to the groups identified by zachary  @xcite .    to evaluate the communities discovered in the florentine families network , we use the tight constraint of party loyalty .",
    "hence the families could be either medicean , oligarch , or have split loyalties .",
    "we note that this is a very conservative evaluation criterion , since there were factions present within the parties themselves  @xcite .",
    "since families with split loyalties would be correctly classified as belonging to either of the two parties , we remove them from purity calculation , focusing instead on identifying community of party loyalists only .",
    "purity is further reduced by the presence of the two isolated groups .",
    "however , purity of discovered communities increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the small local communities found at lower value of @xmath0 could indicate factions within parties .",
    "a variety of metrics have been proposed to measure node s centrality in a network  @xcite , yet few studies systematically evaluated their performance on real - world networks .",
    "liben - nowell and kleinberg  @xcite compared the performance of several commonly used centrality metrics on the link prediction task and found katz score  @xcite to be the most effective measure for this task , outperforming pagerank  @xcite and its variants .",
    "the @xmath0-centrality metric modifies the katz score by introducing a parameter @xmath0 , that gives a weight to indirect links and also sets the length scale of interactions in the network .",
    "we showed recently  @xcite that normalized @xmath0-centrality outperforms other centrality metrics on the task of predicting influential nodes in an online social network .",
    "guimera and collaborators  @xcite proposed role - based description of complex networks .",
    "they define a role in terms of the relative within - community degree @xmath98 ( which measures how well the node is connected to other nodes in its community ) and participation coefficient @xmath99 ( which measures how well the node is connected to nodes in other communities ) .",
    "they proposed a heuristic classification scheme based on where the nodes lie in the @xmath98@xmath99 plane .",
    "this classification scheme is similar to the local vs. globally - connected distinction we are making , with connector nodes being more globally connected nodes while provincial hubs and peripheral nodes are more locally connected .",
    "role - based analysis requires community decomposition of the network to be performed first .",
    "this is a computationally expensive procedure for most real - world networks .",
    "our approach , on the other hand , allows us to differentiate between roles of nodes in a more computationally efficient way .",
    "community detection is another active area in networks research ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . like us , arenas et al .",
    "@xcite have generalized modularity to find correlations between nodes that go beyond nearest neighbors .",
    "their approach relies on the presence of motifs  @xcite , i.e. , connected subgraphs such as cycles , to identify communities within a network .",
    "for example , higher than expected density of triangles implies presence of a community , and a triangle modularity may be defined to identify it .",
    "the motif - based modularity uses the size of the motif to impose a limit on the proximity of neighbors .",
    "our method , on the other hand , imposes no such limit .",
    "the measure of global correlation computed using @xmath0-centrality is equal to the weighted average of correlations for motifs of different sizes .",
    "our method enables us to easily calculate this complex term .",
    "in this paper , we introduced normalized @xmath0-centrality as a metric to study network structure .",
    "like the original @xmath0-centrality  @xcite on which it is based , this metric measures the number of paths that exist between nodes in a network , attenuated by their length with the attenuation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter sets the length scale of the interaction .",
    "when @xmath19 , the centrality metric takes into account direct edges only and is equivalent to degree centrality . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the metric takes into consideration more distant network interactions , becoming a more global measure .",
    "normalized @xmath0-centrality allows us to smoothly interpolate between local metrics , such as degree centrality , and global metrics , such as eigenvector centrality  @xcite .",
    "unlike the original @xmath0-centrality , which bounds @xmath0 to be less than the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency metric of the network , normalized @xmath0-centrality sets no such limit .",
    "we used normalized @xmath0-centrality to study the structure of networks , specifically , identify important nodes and communities within the network .",
    "we extended the modularity maximization class of algorithms  @xcite to use ( normalized ) @xmath0-centrality , rather than edge density , as a measure of network connectivity . for small values of @xmath0 smaller , more locally connected communities",
    "emerge , while for larger values of @xmath0 , we observe larger globally connected communities .",
    "we also used this metric to rank nodes in a network . by studying changes in rankings that occur",
    "when parameter @xmath0 is varied , we were able to identify locally important ` leaders ' and globally important ` bridges ' or ` brokers ' that facilitate communication between different communities .",
    "we applied this approach to benchmark networks studied in literature and found that it results in network division in close agreement with the ground truth .",
    "we can easily extend this definition to multi - modal networks that link entities of different types , and use approach described in this paper to study the structure of such networks  @xcite .",
