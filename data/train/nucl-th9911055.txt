    "these formulae provide a possibility to identify multiboson effects among others .",
    "particularly , the width of the low-@xmath331 enhancement due to the be condensation decreases with the size of the system as @xmath433 and this narrowing makes the observation of the effect easier .",
    "the results of the considered simple model should not be taken , however , too literally since :    \\a ) due to its static character , the model does not explicitly account for the experimental indications on a constant freeze - out phase space density and the related expansion of the emission volume .",
    "the qualitative application of our model to heavy ion collisions is however possible in the limited phase space regions .",
    "for example , the pions with a rapidity difference greater than about unity have to be considered as originating from different static sources ; as discussed in section [ sec2b ] , the residual slow relative motion , if decoupled from other source characteristics , merely leads to a wider momentum dependence of the emission function in eq .",
    "( [ 8.71 ] ) : @xmath434 ;    \\b ) due to a mixture of different production processes ( _ e.g. _ , due to contribution of different impact parameters ) , the real multiplicity distribution and particle spectra will be rather weighted sums of those in eqs .",

    ". however , there can be large local density fluctuations - speckles which can give rise to noticeable multiboson effects even at a moderate value of the mean phase space density ;    \\d ) on the other hand , the multiboson effects can be somewhat suppressed due to a possible violation of the factorization assumption in eq .",
    "( [ 8.74a ] ) or due to the lack of the reflection symmetry of the emission volume . in latter case the functions @xmath170 are no more real ;    \\e ) for identical charged pions , the be effects",
    "are also suppressed due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "since this repulsion is important only in a weakly populated region of very small relative momenta determined by the pair bohr radius @xmath436 fm , the suppression of the global be weights @xmath46 is rather small .",
    "for example , for @xmath240 this suppression , being about @xmath437 , is usually less than one per mill .",
    "the coulomb distortion of the global multiboson effects is therefore negligible in the rare gas limit . nevertheless , since the coulomb repulsion destroys the formation of the condensates made up from positive and negative pions in the disjoint phase space regions , it can lead to noticeable differences between charged and neutral pions in dense systems .",
    "particularly , we can expect a decrease of the charge - to - neutral multiplicity ratio with the increasing phase space density .",
    "because of large numbers of positive and negative pions produced in heavy ion collisions , one could also raise a question about importance of the coulomb screening effects violating standard two - body treatment of the correlations in the low density limit .",
    "there are however arguments showing that the screening will be of minor importance even at lhc @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the scenario with a constant phase - space density the corresponding debye radius @xmath438^{-1/2 } ,   \\label{8.52}\\ ] ] where @xmath439 and @xmath440 is the total density of charged pions in the configuration space , will be also constant , up to a weak energy dependence due to the temperature t. assuming that pions with a rapidity difference greater than unity come from spatially disjoint regions of phase - space , we can put @xcite @xmath441 and obtain @xmath442 fm at @xmath443 and @xmath444 mev / c ( @xmath445 ) .",
    "thus at lhc energies we can expect the characteristic distances between the pion production points comparable or larger than the screening radius @xmath446 leading to a suppression of the usual two - particle coulomb effects .",
    "in fact , two charged pions produced at a distance @xmath447 start to feel their coulomb field only after some time when the density decreases to a value corresponding to debye radius larger than @xmath448 . during this time the vector of the relative distance between the pion emission points increases by @xcite @xmath449 .",

    "the approximate analytical formulae are given allowing to follow the dependence of these quantities on the phase space density parameters thus providing a possibility for the identification of the multiboson effects among others .",

    "- the lowest order cumulant approximation , suggested for a practical account of multiboson effects in realistic transport code simulations @xcite , has been shown to be reasonable at moderate densities indicated by the experimental data",
    ".    - at high densities , the spectra are mainly determined by the universal condensate term @xmath486 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath487 and @xmath488 ) and the initially narrow poisson multiplicity distribution approaches a wide be one : @xmath489 . as a result , the intercepts of the inclusive and fixed-@xmath0 correlation functions ( properly normalized to 1 at large @xmath92 ) approach 2 and 1 , respectively and their low-@xmath353 slopes rapidly vanish with increasing density ; the corresponding increase of the apparent correlation function width is however rather slow - logarithmic in the density .",
    "- it is found that , even near the condensate regime , the inclusive characteristics saturate at rather moderate multiplicities of some multiples of @xmath272 thus justifying the neglect of energy  momentum constraints in the considered analytical model .",
