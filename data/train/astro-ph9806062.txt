    "a history of star formation in galaxies over roughly the last half of the hubble time has been inferred with reasonable accuracy by combining the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in the local universe ( gallego et al .",

    "this history of unobscured star formation in galaxies can be described adequately by a power - law increase in the comoving density of star - formation activity with redshift @xmath0 of the form @xmath1 with @xmath6 out to @xmath7 , followed by a decrease at higher redshifts .",
    "observations made in the near - infrared waveband by connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have provided further support for the suggestion that the sfr peaks at @xmath52 .",
    "this standard picture of the star - formation history is shown in fig.1 .",

    "this work has greatly increased our knowledge of the evolution of star formation activity in the universe ; however , the points plotted in fig.1 in fact only represent firm lower limits to the true sfr at each epoch .",
    "extinction due to any interstellar dust in the optically selected observed galaxies suppresses their flux densities in the rest - frame optical and ultraviolet wavebands , and so leads to an underestimation of their sfr , sometimes by quite considerable factors ( @xmath8 ) . using estimates of obscuration in lyman - dropout galaxies derived from restframe ultraviolet spectra , pettini et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) have recently revised the global sfr at redshifts greater than 2 upwards by a factor of about 5 , as shown by the open boxes in fig.1 .",
    "however , it is difficult to correct optical and ultraviolet spectra reliably for the effects of dust , and so these revisions are rather uncertain . in contrast , the associated rest - frame mid- and far - infrared thermal emission from the interstellar dust grains that are heated by absorbing optical and ultraviolet photons can be detected directly and used to place limits on the dust mass and sfr of the galaxies .",
    "the first observations of dust emission from external galaxies were made by the _",
    "iras _ satellite .",
    "nearby galaxies selected on the grounds of blue colours in the optical waveband were found to emit typically 60 per cent of their total luminosity in the far - infrared waveband ( mazzarella & balzano 1986 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of the population of galaxies detected at a wavelength of 60@xmath9 m by _ iras _ extends out to @xmath10 , and is consistent with pure luminosity evolution of the form @xmath11 ( saunders et al .",

    "however , although they trace the star - formation history over at least half the hubble time , these observations do not strongly constrain the sfr in the early universe , an era crucial for distinguishing between competing galaxy formation models ( cole et al .",

    "the population of submillimetre - luminous galaxies that produce the far - infrared / submillimetre - wave background signal were detected by smail , ivison & blain ( 1997 , hereafter sib ) .",
    "the counts of faint galaxies in the submillimetre waveband are very sensitive to the form of galaxy evolution at high redshift because the @xmath14corrections expected for distant galaxies are very large and negative .",
    "hence high - redshift galaxies are likely to make a substantial contribution to the counts ( blain & longair 1993a ) , which in turn provide a sensitive test of galaxy evolution models in the early universe .",
    "sib exploited the especially strong magnification bias expected in rich clusters of galaxies in the submillimetre waveband ( blain 1997 ) to increase the detectability of the population of background galaxies .",
    "unless the cluster galaxies have extremely high and undetected sfrs , the contribution of flux densities from galaxies within the lensing clusters should be at least an order of magnitude less than that from background sources .",

    "however , it is difficult to translate between such a measurement of hot dust and the cooler dust that dominates the energy emission of a galaxy , and so the inferred global sfr ( rowan - robinson et al .  1997 ) is very uncertain ( hughes 1996 ) .",
    "spectral features in dust emission in the mid - infrared waveband are also likely to affect the results ( xu et al . 1998 ) .",
    "much more information about the population of mid - infrared - luminous galaxies will be proved in 1999 by the _ wide - field infrared explorer ( wire ) _ satellite ( shupe et al . 1998 ) .",

    "even before the completion of redshift surveys of submillimetre - selected galaxies we can still obtain useful constraints on the star - formation history at high redshifts by combining observations of discrete sources with measurements of the intensity of background radiation in the millimetre , submillimetre and far - infrared wavebands to derive self - consistent models for the evolution of the population of dusty galaxies . at very low redshifts , @xmath34 , these are constrained to match the normalization and evolution of the 60-@xmath9 m counts of _ iras _ galaxies .",

    "most of the degeneracy between the values of dust temperature and evolution parameter is broken by including information from the 175-@xmath9 m counts , and so a robust estimate of the form of evolution of dusty galaxies at low redshifts can be obtained .",

    "although distinct populations of dusty galaxies exist in the local universe ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , in this paper we are investigating the global evolution of galaxies , driven by observations that are sensitive to galaxies out to redshifts of about 10 .",
    "hence , while such multi - component models may be required to explain more detailed observations in the future , we do not believe that the introduction of additional parameters is justified by the data at present .",

    "we assume that the frequency - dependent emissivity function of dust @xmath40 can be described in the millimetre and submillimetre wavebands by a simple power - law function @xmath41 ( hughes 1996 ; ivison et al .",
    "the dust emission spectrum is hence a modified planck function with a rayleigh  jeans power - law index of @xmath42 . at shorter far - infrared wavelengths this function would decline exponentially as a function of frequency , turning over at a wavelength of @xmath43@xmath9 m for a typical dust temperature of order @xmath44k ( hughes 1996 ) .",

    "a reasonable fit to radiative transfer models of dusty star - forming galaxies is provided by a value @xmath47 .",
    "these models are important for interpreting observations at wavelengths shorter than 50@xmath9 m but not very relevant here ( see goldschmidt et al .",

    "secondly , the tightness of the constraints imposed on the model parameters by the background measurements and the 850-@xmath9 m counts are comparable . as the accuracy of the 850-@xmath9 m counts is set to increase significantly when the complete cluster sample is presented ( blain et al .  submitted ; smail et al . in preparation ) and the data from other surveys becomes available , knowledge derived from the counts will be the determining factor in discriminating between models of galaxy evolution .",
    "thirdly , the locus of the best - fitting parameters is a line and not a distinct peak .",

    "is removed from the curves in fig.10(a ) , a lower mass limit of about 0.7m@xmath71 is required in the imf .",
    "this is certainly a plausible scenario : a modified imf in distant star - forming galaxies could account for these results , and would predict a stellar density at the present epoch for the submillimetre - derived models that is smaller by a factor of 4 compared with that shown in fig.10(a ) .",
    "a lower mass limit to the imf of 3m@xmath71 was suggested by zepf & silk ( 1996 ) in order to explain mass - to - light ratios of elliptical galaxies , and rieke et al .",

    "the potential variations in the high - redshift imf are discussed by larson ( 1998 ) .",

    "such a population almost certainly exists . both the brightest submillimetre - wave object detected by sib and the prototype of ultraluminous distant dusty galaxies , iras f10214 + 4724 , contain agn which must contribute to the heating of dust in these galaxies ( ivison et al .",

    "however , including a more substantial population of agn - powered obscured sources at high redshifts would delay metal enrichment as compared with a model in which the sources were powered by star formation alone . if agn outnumbered starbursts by a ratio of 4:1 , then the enrichment curves in the submillimetre - selected models in fig.10(b ) would fall into line with the data .",

    "the star formation histories in dusty galaxies that account for all of the far - infrared and submillimetre - wave data appear to be inconsistent with observations of @xmath105 and high - redshift metal enrichment .",
    "the results depend on the assumed imf in dusty galaxies , and the optically derived data with which they are compared could well be subject to systematic biases .",
    "these biases would tend to lower the measured enrichment at high redshifts , and lead to a global value of enrichment in better agreement with the predictions of the submillimetre - derived models , which we expect to be unaffected by either systematic biases or local effects .",
    "if the optical data is taken at face value , then either an imf biased to high - mass star formation or a significant fraction , perhaps up to 60per cent , of distant ultraluminous submillimetre - wave sources must be powered by agn in order to reconcile the submillimetre - wave and optical data .",
    "if the fraction of agn at high redshifts reached about 60per cent , then the extinction - corrected star - formation history discussed by pettini et al .",
