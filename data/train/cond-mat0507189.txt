    "in recent years there has been a tremendous interest in electro - optical properties of ii - vi semiconductors in particular epitaxial ii - vi heterostructures .",
    "new developments @xcite in the growth of si lattice - matched bese@xmath4te@xmath5 open the opportunity to a new class of si based devices .",
    "be - chalcogenides are wide - band gap zinc blende semiconductors with lattice constants close to that of si .",
    "thus bete and bese have the lattice constants of 5.6269 and 5.1477  , respectively , 3.6 % larger and 5.2 % smaller than si .",
    "vegard s law says that the lattice matched composition with si is bese@xmath4te@xmath5",
    ". therefore be - chalcogenides are candidates for si - based heterostructures .",
    "the difference in size and orbital energies between se and te in addition to large lattice mismatch between bete and bese makes the virtual - crystal approximation ( vca ) inappropriate for the ternary alloy bese@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "the band anti - crossing ( bac ) model @xcite has been introduced in order to explain the electronic structure of highly mismatched iii - v - n alloys and ii - vi alloys like znse@xmath1te@xmath2 @xcite . at impurity like concentrations close to both end points ,",
    "the electronegativity difference between constituent elements gives rise to localized energy levels close to the conduction or valence band .",
    "thus in the znse(znte)-rich side , the band gap bowing is mostly determined by the anticrossing interaction between the te(se ) localized level , which behaves like an impurity , and the extended states of znse valence band ( znte conduction band ) near the center of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "in this communication we develop a model which is a natural extension of the bac model to empirical tight - binding ( etb ) . based on this model",
    "we determine optical bandgap of bese@xmath1te@xmath2 alloy and further we analyze the band folding in si / bese@xmath4te@xmath5 heterostructures .",
    "there are several studies employing tight - binding ( tb ) models for hms .",
    "they use either supercells @xcite or add extra parameters to the usual tb parameters within the bac model @xcite .",
    "our approach needs no extra parameters others than the usual tb parameters and is a natural extension of the bac model to tb .",
    "we consider first the dilute limit .",
    "the starting point is the impurity model of anderson @xcite .",
    "consider a complex - structured impurity interacting with the host crystal having the hamiltonian    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is hamiltonian of the host crystal , @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the impurity and @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the interaction between impurity and crystal .",
    "the above hamiltonians have the following expressions @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 here _",
    "@xmath13 _ is the spin index , @xmath14 are the energy levels of impurity at the @xmath15th site ( @xmath16 , the total number of impurities ) , @xmath17 is band index of the crystal , @xmath18 is the wavevector , @xmath19are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of electrons on impurity levels .",
    "@xmath20 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of electrons of the bands in the crystal , and @xmath9 is the coupling between impurity and crystal and has factor @xmath21 with @xmath22 total number of sites . in order to calculate the effect of impurity we shall use an expression for the projection of @xmath23 into * @xmath24 * , a subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath26 ( and @xmath27 the projections onto ( out of ) * @xmath24 * as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 = \\left [ { q , h_0 } \\right ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "let the green function of the entire system be denoted by @xmath33 and the projected part onto * @xmath24 * as @xmath34 .",
    "in this way we denote the projection onto * @xmath24 * of any operator @xmath35 as : @xmath36 .",
    "straightforward algebra gives us    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .",
    "one can expand @xmath39 for small @xmath9    @xmath40    due to @xmath41 in the expansion , all the intermediate states are outside of * @xmath24 * , therefore the diagrams representing @xmath42 must be irreducible",
    ". if @xmath39 is small compared to @xmath43 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can be expanded in a power series of @xmath44 as    @xmath45    no approximations have been made so far . if @xmath9 is small we can replace @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) by the first two terms and summing up all contributions ( the first one is 0 in our model ) . by making such an approximation we , in fact , sum an entire class of diagrams .",
    "the impurity averaging is made by noticing that all macroscopically observables are self - averaging , i.e. they have asymptotically exact values in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "in other words the average of the product of such quantities is equal ( within asymptotic accuracy ) to the product of their averages . therefore the impurity averaging in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is simply taken as averaging @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . by keeping the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the model is equivalent to the optical model laid out in ref . :",
    "it only brings the shift to the energy levels of the unperturbed hamiltonian and gives the following form for the diagonal part of the green function of @xmath17th band    @xmath47    where @xmath3 is the dilute concentration . for one band and 1-level impurity",
    "the result is identical to the bac model @xcite .",

    "they reproduce valence band edges @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and the conduction band edges @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the average crystal is considered by the average parameters .",
    "the hopping parameters were scaled according to the harrison scaling rule @xcite and then averaged . the band offset between bete and bese",
    "is considered to be 0.41 ev as indicated in ref .. in this way one calculates the bowing of the on - site energies in addition to linear terms given by vca .",
    "the hybrid states of the impurity lay outside bandgap of the host crystal , such that the net effect is large deviation from linearity of the band edges of the alloy .",
    "mathematically one diagonalizes an extended hamiltonian and accounts for the shifts in the band edges at the _ @xmath63 _ and x point in the brillouin zone .",
    "those shifts are used to calculate the bowing parameters for each self - energy .",
    "we calculate the bowing parameters of the direct and indirect bandgap around 0 and 1 limits of concentration according to bac model and follow the spirit of the vca to interpolate linearly the effect of bac model between these limits .",
    "the linear interpolation has been successfully used to fit experimental data for znsete alloy @xcite .",
    "linear interpolation for the direct and indirect bandgaps is consistent with linear interpolation performed on the tight - binding parameters .",

    "the conduction band minimum is located at the x - point in the brillouin zone , such that the fundamental bandgap is indirect .",
    "the vca model gives almost constant bowing parameters of 0.49 ev for the direct ( optical ) bandgap .",
    "the bowing of the direct bandgap given by the bac model is much steeper on the se - rich ( 9.8 ev ) side than on the te - rich side ( 2 ev ) suggesting that utilizing just one bowing parameter is inappropriate to describe bandgaps in these structures . the results for the indirect bandgap follow the same trend as that of the direct bandgap ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) with the minimum of the indirect bandgap at 1.7 ev for x around 0.6 .",
    "this trend is similar because of the large bowing of the valence band edge in addition to conduction band edge .",
    "moreover , the vca results are very close to the linear bandgap .",
    "direct and indirect bandgaps in bese@xmath1te@xmath2 : linear interpolation ( full line ) ; vca ( line with squares ) ; bac(diamonds ) ; and interpolation to bac model ( dotted line ) . ]",
    "we calculated also electronic and optical properties of a si / bese@xmath4te@xmath5 superlattice ( sl ) in ( 001 ) direction .",
    "abrupt interface , flat band conditions were assumed .",
    "we adjusted the conduction band offset between bese@xmath4te@xmath5 and si at 1.2 ev as determined from electrical measurements @xcite .",
    "two interface subbands were found , one empty and one occupied within the si bandgap .",
    "the origin of these interface subbands is due to polar nature of the interface or large difference between on - site energies of si on the one side and be or se / te on the other side.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot the joint density of states for vertical transitions in ( si@xmath66(bese@xmath4te@xmath67 sl . in such structures , due to band folding",
    ", the threshold of the direct bandgap is lowered for si from 3.35 ev to 1 ev .",
    "the threshold is slightly below the fundamental bandgap of si because of the two interface bands .",
    "moreover , the first peak is wider .",
    "si as an indirect bandgap semiconductor has two kinds of confined states in a quantum well @xcite , one given by the longitudinal valleys with an effective mass of 0.19m@xmath68 and the other given by transverse valley with an effective mass of 0.91m@xmath68 .",
    "hence the confined states that have a different first peak is made of the first states of both types of valley .",

    "in conclusion , we extended the band anticrossing model to the empirical tight - binding theory .",
    "we used the anderson model for impurity and a sp@xmath0 hybrid basis for zincblende structures within sp@xmath0s * hamiltonian .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the alloy was obtained by impurity averaging and keeping only the terms responsible for energy shifts due to alloying .",
    "the pair impurity effects can easily be included as well . thus no extra parameters are needed to calculate bandgaps .",
    "the model was used for bese@xmath69te@xmath1 alloy .",
    "bese@xmath2te@xmath1 shows large band bowing , larger on the se - rich side similar to znsete system .",
    "bandgap was interpolated linearly between the two dilute limits .",
