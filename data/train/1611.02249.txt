    "we begin this section by recalling the definition of a poly - klumpenhouwer network ( pk - net ) , and then discuss about its limitations as a motivation for introducing relational pk - nets .      following the work of lewin @xcite , transformational music theory has progressively shifted the music - theoretical and analytical focus from the  object - oriented \" musical content to the operational musical process . as such , transformations between musical elements are emphasized . in the original framework of lewin ,",
    "the set of transformations often form a group , with a corresponding group action on the set of musical objects . within this framework ,",
    "klumpenhouwer networks ( henceforth k - nets ) have stressed the deep synergy between set - theoretical and transformational approaches thanks to their anchoring in both group and graph theory , as observed by many scholars @xcite .",
    "we recall that a k - net is informally defined as a labelled graph , wherein the labels of the vertices belong to the set of pitch classes , whereas arrows are labelled with possible transformations between these pitch classes .",
    "an example of a k - net is given in figure [ fig : knet ] .",
    "klumpenhouwer networks allow one to conveniently visualize at once the musical elements and the possible transformations between them .    following david lewin s @xcite and henry klumpenhouwer s @xcite original group - theoretical description ,",
    "theoretical studies have mostly focused until now on the underlying algebraic methods related to the automorphisms of the t / i group or of the more general t / m affine group @xcite , @xcite . following the very first attempt by mazzola and andreatta at formalizing k - nets in a more general categorical setting as limits of diagrams within framework of denotators @xcite",
    ", we have recently proposed a categorical construction , called poly - klumpenhouwer networks ( henceforth pk - nets ) , which generalizes the notion of k - nets in various ways @xcite .",

    "let @xmath1 be a category , and @xmath10 a functor from @xmath1 to the category @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a small category and @xmath12 a functor from @xmath11 to @xmath3 with non - void values .",
    "a pk - net of form @xmath12 and of support @xmath10 is a 4-tuple @xmath13 , in which    *   @xmath14 is a functor from @xmath11 to @xmath1 , * and @xmath15 is a natural transformation from @xmath12 to @xmath16 .    a pk - net @xmath13 can be summed up by the following diagram .",
    "we detail below the importance of each element of this diagram with respect to transformational music analysis .",
    "\\(a ) at ( 0,0 ) @xmath11 ; ( b ) at ( 3,0 ) @xmath1 ; ( c ) at ( 1.5,-2 ) @xmath3 ; ( a )  ( b ) node[above , midway]@xmath14 ; ( b )  ( c )",
    "node[right , midway ] ( d ) @xmath10 ; ( a )  ( c ) node[left , midway ] ( e ) @xmath12 ;    \\(e ) to[bend left ] node[above , midway]@xmath15 ( d ) ;    the category @xmath1 and the functor @xmath17 represent the context of the analysis .",
    "traditional transformational music theory commonly relies on a group acting on a given set of objects : the t / i group acting on the set of the twelve pitch classes , the same t / i group acting simply transitively on the set of the 24 major and minor triads , or the plr group acting simply transitively on the same set , to name a few examples . from a categorical point of view , the data of a group and its action on a set is equivalent to the data of a functor from a single - object category with invertible morphisms to the category of sets .",
    "however , this situation can be further generalized by considering any category @xmath1 along with a functor @xmath17 .",
    "the morphisms of the category @xmath1 are therefore the musical transformations of interest . for example , noll @xcite has studied previously a monoid of eight elements and its action on the set of the twelve pitch classes : this can be considered as a single - object category @xmath1 with eight non - invertible morphisms along with its corresponding functor @xmath17 , where the image of the only object of @xmath1 is the set of the twelve pitch classes .",
    "the category @xmath11 serves as the abstract skeleton of the pk - net : as such , its objects and morphisms are abstract entities , which are labelled by mean of the functor @xmath14 from @xmath11 to the category @xmath1 . by explicitly separating the categories @xmath11 and @xmath1 , we allow for the same pk - net skeleton to be interpreted in different contexts .",
    "for example , a given category @xmath1 may describe the relationships between pitch classes , while another category @xmath18 may describe the relationships between time - spans @xcite .",
    "different functors @xmath19 or @xmath20 will then label the arrows of @xmath11 differently with transformations from @xmath1 or @xmath18 , depending on whether the pk - net describes pitch - classes or time - spans .",
    "two pk - nets may actually be related by different kinds of _ morphisms of pk - nets _ , which have been described previously @xcite .",
    "note that the objects of @xmath11 do not represent the actual musical elements of a pk - net : these are introduced by the functor @xmath12 from @xmath11 to @xmath3 .",
    "this functor sends each object of @xmath11 to an actual set , which may contain more than a single element , and whose elements abstractly represent the musical objects of study .",
    "however , these elements are not yet labelled . in the same way",
    "the morphisms of @xmath11 represent abstract relationships which are given a concrete meaning by the functor @xmath14 , these elements are labelled by the natural transformation @xmath15 .",
    "the elements in the image of @xmath10 represent musical entities on which the category @xmath1 acts , and one would therefore need a way to connect the elements in the image of @xmath12 with those in the image of @xmath10 .",
    "however , one can not simply consider a collection of functions between the images of @xmath12 and the images of @xmath10 in order to label the musical objects in the pk - net .",
    "indeed , one must make sure that two elements in the images of @xmath12 which are related by a function @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 being a morphism of @xmath11 ) actually correspond to two elements in the images of @xmath10 related by the function @xmath23 .",
    "the purpose of the natural transformation @xmath15 is thus to ensure the coherence of the whole diagram .",
    "while pk - nets have been so far defined in @xmath3 , there is _ a priori _ no restriction on the category that should be used .",
    "for example , the approach of mazzola and andreatta in @xcite uses modules and categories of presheaves . as noticed in @xcite , pk - nets",
    "could also be defined in such categories .",
    "alternatively , the purpose of this paper is to consider _ relational pk - nets _ in which the category @xmath3 of sets and functions between them is replaced by the category @xmath2 of sets and binary relations between them . the reasons for doing so are detailed in the next sections .",
    "the definition of pk - nets introduced above leads to musical networks of greater generality than traditional klumpenhouwer networks , as was shown previously in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it allows one to study networks of sets of different cardinalities , not necessarily limited to singletons .",
    "we recall here a prototypical example showing how a dominant seventh chord may be obtained from the transformation of an underlying major chord , with an added seventh .",
    "let @xmath1 be the @xmath24 group , considered as a single - object category , and consider its natural action on the set @xmath25 of the twelve pitch classes ( with the usual semi - tone encoding ) , which defines a functor @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath11 define the order of the ordinal number @xmath27 , i.e. the category with two objects @xmath28 and @xmath29 and precisely one morphism @xmath30 , and consider the functor @xmath31 which sends @xmath22 to @xmath32 .",
    "consider now a functor @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and such that @xmath36 , for @xmath37 .",
    "consider the natural transformation @xmath15 such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath13 is a pk - net of form @xmath12 and support @xmath10 which describes the transposition of the @xmath4 major triad to the @xmath5 major triad subset of the dominant seventh @xmath45 chord .",
    "however , one specific limitation of this approach appears quickly : whereas transformations between sets of increasing cardinalities can easily be modeled in this framework , transformations between sets of decreasing cardinalities sometimes can not .",
    "consider for example a pk - net @xmath13 with a category @xmath11 with at least two objects @xmath28 and @xmath29 and a morphism @xmath30 between them , a functor @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and a group @xmath1 with a functor @xmath17 .",
    "consider two elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 of @xmath51 , an element @xmath52 of @xmath53 , and assume that we have @xmath54 . by definition of the pk - net",
    ", we must have @xmath55 , and since @xmath1 is a group this imposes @xmath56 , i.e. the two musical objects @xmath49 and @xmath50 must have the same labels .    as an example , there is no possibility to define a pk - net showing the inverse transformation from a dominant seventh @xmath45 chord to a @xmath4 major triad . if one tries to define a new pk - net @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and with a natural transformation @xmath61 such that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , then one quickly sees that no function @xmath68 can exist which would satisfy the requirement that @xmath61 is a natural transformation from @xmath12 to @xmath69 , since all the elements constituting the seventh chord have different labels in @xmath25 .    in a possible way to resolve this problem , and",
    "from the point of view that the @xmath45 dominant seventh chord consists of an @xmath5 major chord with an added @xmath70 note , we would intuitively like to `` forget '' about the @xmath70 and consider only the transformation of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath71 in @xmath51 to @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 respectively in @xmath75 . in other words , we would like to consider _ partial functions _ between sets , instead of ordinary ones .",
    "in order to do so , one must abandon the category @xmath3 and choose a category which makes it possible to consider such morphisms .",
    "this simple example motivates the introduction in this paper of _ relational pk - nets _ based on the category @xmath2 of sets and binary relations between them .",
    "although there also exists a category @xmath76 whose objects are sets and morphisms are partial functions between them , the use of @xmath2 includes the case of partial functions as well as even more general applications , as will be seen in the next sections .",
    "the use of relations between musical objects figures prominently in the recent literature on music theory .",
    "perhaps one of the most compelling examples is the work of douthett and cohn on parsimonious voice - leading and its subsequent formalization in the form of parsimonious graphs @xcite . in order to formalize the notion of parsimony , douthett introduced in @xcite the @xmath77 relation between two pc - sets , the definition of which we recall here .",
    "we recall that a _ pitch class set ( pc - set ) _ is a set in @xmath25 ( which encodes the different pitch classes with the usual semitone encoding ) .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath79 be two pc - sets of equal cardinality @xmath80 .",
    "we say that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are @xmath77-related if there exists a set @xmath83 and a bijection @xmath84 such that we have @xmath85 , @xmath86 if @xmath87 , and    * @xmath88 if @xmath89 , and * @xmath90 if @xmath91 .    in other words ,",
    "if @xmath82 is @xmath77-related to @xmath81 , @xmath92 pitch - classes in @xmath81 move by a semi - tone , while @xmath93 pitch - classes move by a whole tone , the rest of the pitch classes being identical .",
    "note that @xmath77 is a symmetric relation . from this definition",
    ", douthett defines a _ parsimonious graph for a @xmath77 relation _ on a set @xmath94 of pc - sets as the graph whose set of vertices is @xmath94 and whose set of edges is the set @xmath95 .",
    "a notable example is the `` cube dance '' graph , which is the parsimonious graph for the @xmath96 relation ( i.e. the voice - leading relation between chords resulting from the ascending or descending movement of a single pitch class by a semitone ) on the set @xmath94 of 28 elements containing the 24 major and minor triads as well as the four augmented triads .",
    "this graph is represented on figure [ fig : cubedance ] .",
    "one should note that this graph contains the subgraphs defined on the set @xmath94 by the neo - riemannian operations @xmath97 and @xmath98 viewed as relations .",
    "indeed , given @xmath81 and @xmath82 in @xmath94 such that @xmath99 or @xmath100 , one can immediately verify by definition of these neo - riemannian operations that we have @xmath101 .",
    "this subgraph is called `` hexacycles '' by douthett .",
    "the cube dance adds to `` hexacycles '' the possible relations between the augmented triads and the hexatonic cycles , which , as commented by douthett , `` _ _ serve as the couplings between hexatonic cycles and function nicely as a way of modulating between hexatonic sets _ _ '' .",

    "however , the relations between the actual musical objects under study in the images of the lax functor @xmath12 may not cover the range of possibilities offered by the relations in the image of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we use a lax natural transformation @xmath15 instead of an ordinary one , such that the images by @xmath15 of the relations given through @xmath12 be included in those given through @xmath16 . informally speaking ,",
    "the lax natural transformation @xmath15 `` selects '' a restricted range of related elements among the possibilities given by the functor @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we require that each component of @xmath15 be left - total , so that all musical objects are `` named '' in the images of the functor @xmath16 . all the constitutive elements of a relational pk - net @xmath205 are summed - up in the diagram of figure [ fig : relpknet ] .",
