    "one of the long - sought goals in low - temperature physics is the creation of two interpenetrating superfluids .",
    "early efforts were directed at mixtures of helium isotopes .",
    "more recently , following the experiments with bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of atomic gases @xcite , considerable efforts have been made to create systems where two species of atoms condense simultaneously .",
    "this goal was partially achieved for two different hyperfine spin states of @xmath1rb , which were condensed in the same trap by the technique of sympathetic cooling @xcite .",
    "later the dynamics of the complex relative motion of the condensates has been studied @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the measurement of the relative phase between the two condensates has also been demonstrated @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the two condensates have a substantial overlap , although they do not completely interpenetrate each other in the stationary state .",
    "a similar state called `` spinor condensate '' has been observed for sodium gas @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigation of two - component bose systems has started many decades ago with the construction of the phenomenological hydrodynamic equations in the spirit of the landau - khalatnikov two - fluid model for the one - component bec @xcite .",
    "later , this construction has been put onto a microscopic basis @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with alkali atoms have revived the interest in the theory of such systems .",
    "hartree - fock theory has been successfully tested on the two - component @xmath1rb system @xcite .",
    "the stability @xcite , ground - state properties @xcite and collective excitations @xcite have been studied theoretically by using the gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "many properties of two - component , or binary , bec can be understood from symmetry arguments . compared to one - component bose superfluids ,",
    "two - component systems have more interesting pattern of symmetry and symmetry breaking .",
    "condensation in binary bose systems corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of _ two _ ( instead of one ) global u(1 ) symmetries .",
    "these symmetries are related , by noether s theorem , to the separate conservation of the number of atoms of each of the two species .",
    "the quantum state of the binary bose system , therefore , is characterized by two phases of the two condensates . correspondingly , the physics of binary bec is also richer than of usual one - component systems .",
    "the effects of a symmetry are often best exposed by violating the symmetry explicitly in a controlled fashion . a very interesting feature , specific to systems consisting of atoms of the same isotope in different spin states , is that it is possible to couple two condensates by a driving electromagnetic field tuned to the transition frequency . in this case atoms",
    "can be interconverted between the two spin states and the numbers of atoms of each species are not conserved separately anymore ; only the total number of atoms is constant .",
    "this implies that , in the presence of the coupling drive , only one u(1 ) symmetry remains exact , the other one is explicitly violated .",
    "the preserved u(1 ) symmetry obviously comes from the conservation of the total number of atoms , and corresponds to changing the phases of the two condensates by the same amount ( i.e. , leaving the relative phase unchanged ) .",
    "the violated u(1 ) corresponds to changing the relative phase between the two condensate .",
    "the presence of the coupling drive lifts the degeneracy of the ground state with respect to the relative phase .    in this work",
    ", we show that a sufficiently small violation of the u(1 ) symmetry corresponding to the relative phase leads to the existence of a nontrivial static configuration  a domain wall inside which the relative phase changes by @xmath0 . this configuration is a local minimum of the energy",
    ". however , the domain wall is _ not _ topologically stable and can `` unwind '' itself . to unwind , however , the system must overcome an energy barrier .",
    "thanks to this fact , the rate of the spontaneous decay of the domain wall is exponentially suppressed .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : l ] introduces the field - theoretical description of binary bec . in sec.[sec : solution ] we describe the domain wall configuration , whose physical interpretation is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] .",
    "section [ sec : boundary ] deals with the boundary of finite domain walls and the related phenomenon of `` vortex confinement '' .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "[ sec : stability ] we find the metastability condition for the domain wall in the particular case when the densities of the two components are equal , and in appendix [ sec : decay ] two different mechanisms for the decay of the domain wall , operating at different temperature regimes , are considered .",
    "in this section , we use field theory to describe general properties of binary bec .",
    "our goal is to introduce notations and the formalism to lay the ground for the discussion of the domain walls in the next section .",
    "a binary dilute bose system is described by a quantum field theory of two complex scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these fields have the meaning of the wave functions of the two condensates .",
    "the dynamics of these fields is governed by the following lagrangian , @xmath4 where the hamiltonian @xmath5 has the form @xmath6 in eq .",

    ". these can be found by minimizing the potential energy part in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "we shall assume that ( [ stability ] ) is satisfied .    in principle",
    ", the constants @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be arbitrary . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the regime when all three scattering lengths are close to each other , @xmath28 . in the case",
    "when the two species are rubidium atoms in different hyperfine states , these lengths were found experimentally to differ by no more than a few percent . the assumption that @xmath29 also introduces considerable technical simplifications in our treatment .",
    "we introduce the `` average '' scattering amplitude @xmath30 and the deviations from the average @xmath31 so that @xmath32 .",
    "the stability condition ( [ stability ] ) implies that @xmath33 .",

    "note that in the limit @xmath37 the hamiltonian has an su(2 ) symmetry which leads to interesting implications @xcite .    with the lagrangian at hand",
    ", the discussion of symmetry in the introduction can be made concrete . in the absence of the coupling drive , @xmath18 , the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) possesses a u(1 ) @xmath38 u(1 ) symmetry with respect to independent phase rotations of the fields , @xmath39 the corresponding conservation laws are those of the numbers of particles of each species , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . that @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath18 are conserved separately is actually a basic assumption made when we wrote down the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) .",
    "this assumption is not automatically satisfied : it requires that only elastic scattering between atoms is allowed ; inelastic scattering is forbidden . for binary bose systems made of rubidium atoms",
    ", this appears to be a good approximation @xcite .    once the coupling drive is turned on ( @xmath44 ) , the lagrangian is invariant only under a subset of the original u(1 )",
    "@xmath38 u(1 ) rotations ; namely , those which rotate both @xmath2 and @xmath3 by the same angle , @xmath45 therefore one of the u(1 ) symmetries the system enjoyed at @xmath18 is explicitly violated . applying the goldstone theorem ,",
    "we conclude that , at @xmath18 , there are two gapless excitations and only one of these modes remain gapless at @xmath44 .",
    "the gapless modes at @xmath18 are the phonons of the two types of sounds .",
    "one corresponds to the ordinary density wave ( b mode in our paper , see below ) , and another to the concentration wave ( a mode ) in which the densities of the two species oscillate relative to each other in such a way that the total density remains constant .",
    "if we view the two components as being made of the same atoms , but in different hyperfine levels , then the mode a can be alternatively interpreted as a spin polarization wave , in which the density of nuclear spin is a function of space and time .",
    "when the coupling drive is on , only the density wave remains gapless ; the phonon of the concentration ( spin density ) wave is gapped .",
    "let us compute the sound speeds at @xmath18 . to this end",
    "we write @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath46 and expand eq .",

    "the system is `` stiffer '' towards density fluctuations than towards fluctuations of concentration . that modes a and b are indeed concentration and density fluctuations respectively is seen from the corresponding eigenvectors .",

    "the phonons of the a sound acquire a gap @xmath71 for small values of @xmath14 .    in our further discussion we shall need the formulas for the healing , or correlation , lengths , which are defined via the response of the system to a static source coupled locally to the particle density , @xmath72 . as in the case of the sounds , there are also two healing lengths , @xmath73 as seen from eq .",

    "the domain wall solution that we shall describe is , in contrast , a _ local _ minimum of the energy . to find the profile of the domain wall , we vary eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) with respect to @xmath84 and @xmath85 and obtain the following equations @xmath90 for domain walls , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are functions of only one coordinate , say , @xmath91 , and at @xmath92 both approach constant values . a nontrivial solution to eq .",
    "( [ walleq ] ) satisfying these conditions is @xmath93 the characteristic width of the domain wall is @xmath94 .",
    "the tension of the domain wall is @xmath95    the relative phase @xmath96 changes from 0 to @xmath0 as @xmath91 runs from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "note that @xmath96 is defined modulo @xmath0 so it goes a full circle as one passes through the wall .",
    "therefore from the point of view of the energy functional ( [ h ] ) the domain wall ( [ profile ] ) is a topologically nontrivial configuration , which can not be continuously deformed into the @xmath89 configuration .",
    "in fact , one can prove that the domain wall is a configuration with minimal energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) among those where @xmath96 changes by @xmath0 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , and hence , can not decay away , _ as long as eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) applies_. the domain wall is similar to the soliton of the sine - gordon model .",
    "there is a small difference : the ground states on two sides of the domain wall are _ different _ : at @xmath99 @xmath101 , while the ground state at @xmath100 is @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "since @xmath104 are defined mod @xmath0 the latter is equivalent to @xmath105 .    in reality , eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is not the full hamiltonian of the system : it is only an effective description valid at length scales larger than both healing lengths .",
    "the full theory ( [ h - full ] ) contains , besides @xmath84 and @xmath85 , also the density fluctuations @xmath106 and @xmath107 . as a consequence ,",
    "in the full theory , the domain wall ( [ profile ] ) _ can _ be continuously deformed into the trivial configuration @xmath89 .",
    "such deformations necessarily pass through field configurations where either @xmath62 or @xmath63 vanishes at some points : at these points @xmath96 is ill - defined .",
    "thus , the domain wall is not truly topological and can `` unwind '' , i.e. , decay away . the fact that the ground states on the two sides of the wall are different does not prevent the decay : it is possible to construct a field configuration interpolating between @xmath101 and @xmath105 with arbitrarily small energy per unit area .",
    "although the domain wall is not a global minimum of the energy functional , it can still be a _",
    "local _ minimum . in this case , to deform the domain wall into a `` topologically '' trivial configuration with @xmath89 one has to overcome an energy barrier .",
    "the wall is in this case metastable . from our previous discussion",
    "one can conclude that , roughly speaking , the wall is metastable when eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) applies and is unstable when eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is not applicable . for eq.([h ] ) to be valid the wall has to be wider than the largest healing length , @xmath76 .",
    "since the width of the wall decreases as one increases the rabi frequency @xmath14 , the wall is metastable only when @xmath14 is smaller than some critical value @xmath108 .",
    "let us define @xmath109 as the value of the rabi frequency at which the width of the wall @xmath94 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ profile ] ) , is equal to to the longer healing length @xmath76 in eq.([coh_lengths ] ) : @xmath110 the wall is metastable when @xmath14 is less than some critical value @xmath108 of order @xmath109 , @xmath111 to find the exact value of @xmath108 one needs to perform a more refined stability analysis .",
    "we present such an analysis for the special case @xmath112 ( i.e. , when the densities of the two species are equal ) in appendix [ sec : stability ] .",
    "parametrically , the result is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ omegac ] ) , and the ratio @xmath113 is found to be @xmath114 .",
    "using the numerical values typical for experiments with rb : @xmath115 a few @xmath116 @xmath78 , @xmath117  , one finds @xmath118 hz . therefore to have a stable wall the rabi frequency needs to be smaller than about 100 hz .",
    "the domain wall can not be thinner than the longer correlation length @xmath76 , which was estimated above to be a few @xmath82 m .",
    "even when @xmath119 , a metastable wall can still spontaneously decay ( burst ) .",
    "such a decay , as we have said , requires overcoming a potential barrier . at sufficiently large temperature , the mechanism for the decay is thermal activation ( over the barrier ) . at zero or small temperatures ,",
    "the mechanism of the decay is quantum tunneling under the energy barrier .",
    "the decay through thermal activation , which is relevant for the temperatures achieved in current experiments , is considered in appendix [ sec : decay ] , where it is shown that the decay rate is exponentially suppressed , since a global ( macroscopic ) fluctuation is required , unless @xmath14 is very close to @xmath108 .",
    "the domain wall solution found in sec .  [",
    "sec : solution ] allows an interesting physical interpretation which suggests a possible way for their creation in experiments @xcite .",
    "we first note that in a bec the superfluid velocity is proportional to the gradient of the phase . in a two - component bec , there are two such velocities .",
    "@xmath120 equation ( [ walleq ] ) , in particular , implies that the total particle number current vanishes , @xmath121 .",
    "individually , however , the particle number current of each species @xmath122 and @xmath123 are nonzero . from eq.([profile ] ) we find @xmath124 thus the domain wall is a configuration where the two components flow in opposite directions .",
    "the flow is illustrated in fig.[fig : flow ] .",
    "the velocities of the components are largest at the center of the wall ( @xmath125 ) and decrease as one moves toward the edge of the wall .",
    "the flow is concentrated on the wall ; outside the wall ( @xmath126 ) there is essentially no flow .    equation ( [ walleq ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the currents as @xmath127 for a stationary configuration as the one we are considering , eq.([conversion ] ) means that the number of particles in each species is not conserved .",
    "it also implies that there is a _ conversion _ of atoms between the two energy levels due to the coupling drive . in the left half of the wall @xmath128 and there is a conversion of atoms of the second type to atoms of the first type . in the right half @xmath129 and",
    "the conversion goes the opposite way ( fig.[fig : flow ] ) .",
    "the rate of conversion is @xmath130 as is the flow , the conversion rate is also maximal near the wall . far from the wall ( @xmath126 ) there is essentially no conversion . the conversion rate ( [ conversionrate ] ) changes sign at @xmath131 .",
    "since different species correspond to different energy levels of the atom , energy is absorbed in one half of the wall and released in the other .",
    "plane accompanied by spin flips on both sides of it . ]",
    "the interpretation of the domain walls given above suggests a possible method for their creation in experiments @xcite .",
    "one starts with the coupling drive off ( @xmath18 ) and prepares a state where the two condensates flow in opposite directions ( for example , by manipulating the traps ) .",
    "in such a state the relative phase @xmath132 is a linear function of the coordinate along the direction of motion ( say , @xmath91 ) .",
    "one then slowly increases @xmath14 .",
    "the domain walls will be created and the centers of the walls are located at the points where @xmath96 was an odd multiple of @xmath133 ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , etc . ) before @xmath14 was turned on . by changing the velocity of the initial relative motion of the condensates and the final values of",
    "@xmath14 one can change the separation between the domain walls and their width .",
    "such controlled creation of the domain walls , hopefully , can be achieved in future experiments .",
    "so far we have always considered infinite domain walls which have no boundary .",
    "it is also interesting , and perhaps more realistic , to consider domain walls with a boundary .",
    "we shall show that the domain wall can be bounded by a vortex line .",
    "suppose we have a finite domain wall whose boundary is a closed contour @xmath137 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] ) .",
    "we shall assume that the length of @xmath137 is much larger than the width of the wall @xmath94 so one can view the domain wall as an infinitely thin membrane stretched on @xmath137 ( we shall call this picture the `` thin - wall approximation '' ) .",
    "let us now take another , smaller contour which has a nontrivial linking with @xmath137 ( @xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] ) .",
    "as one goes along @xmath138 , one crosses the membrane once , so the relative phase @xmath96 changes by @xmath0 .",
    "this is exactly what one expects from a vortex .",
    "therefore , @xmath137 can be a vortex line .",
    "we recall that the size of the core of the vortex is the healing length @xmath76 , which is smaller or of the same order as the width of the wall .",
    "therefore , in the thin wall approximation , we have an infinitely thin membrane bounded by an infinitely thin vortex line .",
    "one should note that such a bounded domain wall will tend to shrink to reduce its energy , which comes from the wall tension and the tension of the boundary vortex .",
    "conversely , for small non - zero @xmath14 , a vortex must have a domain wall attached to it to minimize the energy due to the nontrivial phase @xmath96 winding around it .",
    "this means that the energy of a single vortex per unit length is increasing linearly with the size of the system in the transverse direction .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation at @xmath18 when the vortex tension has only a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system .",
    "note that there are two types of vortices in binary bec .",
    "those of the first type , which we shall call the @xmath84 vortices , have the condensate @xmath2 vanishing at the vortex center , while @xmath3 is nonzero . analogously",
    "the @xmath85 vortices have @xmath139 and @xmath140 at their centers . as one goes around a @xmath84 vortex , @xmath84 changes by @xmath0 , while @xmath85 does not change , and vice versa for a @xmath85 vortex .",
    "thus @xmath96 changes by either @xmath0 or @xmath141 for the two types of vortices , so the domain wall can be bounded by a vortex of either type .",
    "in contrast to an individual vortex , a pair of @xmath84 and @xmath85 vortices , placed parallel to each other , will have energy per unit length which is only logarithmically divergent .",
    "that is because the @xmath96 `` charges '' of the two vortices cancel each other , so @xmath96 is trivial at spatial infinity ( no winding ) .",
    "the same situation occurs for a pair of parallel vortices of the same type ( @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) with opposite winding ( however , such vortex - antivortex pair can annihilate , while a @xmath142 pair can not ) . in a certain sense",
    ", one can talk about the phenomenon of `` vortex confinement '' : vortices exist only in pairs .",
    "this confinement should , in principle , be observable experimentally , in a rotating two - component bec , which can be already created in a laboratory @xcite .",
    "the vortices are usually identified by the density depletion at their cores , but can be also seen as dislocations of interference fringes due to phase singularities @xcite . with the coupling drive off ( @xmath18 )",
    "such a system contains an equal number of @xmath84 and @xmath85 vortices which are distributed in space with no particular correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath85 vortices .",
    "as one turns on @xmath14 , the vortices will start to pair up and at some point the system will become a collection of composite objects , each being a bound state of a @xmath84 and a @xmath85 vortex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pairs ] ) .",
    "the phenomenon of vortex confinement is very similar to that of quark confinement in the theory of strong interaction ( quantum chromodynamics ) .",
    "similarly to our vortices , quarks and antiquarks do not exist as individual objects , but are confined into composite objects  hadrons .",
    "the analogy with quantum chromodynamics actually stretches further .",
    "if one places a @xmath84 vortex and a @xmath85 vortex at a distance larger than @xmath94 , then a domain wall that connects these two vortices will be formed .",
    "the tension of the domain wall is the force , per unit length , that attracts the two vortices .",
    "the attractive force between the two vortices is thus independent of their separation , given that the latter is larger than the width of the domain wall .",
    "this is analogous to the confining force between a quark and an antiquark , which is also constant at large distances . a confinement model which resembles most",
    "the confinement of the vortices is the three - dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics considered in ref .  @xcite . in this theory",
    "the worldlines of electrically charged particles are analogous to the vortices in bec .",
    "one can also imagine a system of two vortices which rotate around each other so that the confining force ( from the domain wall ) balances the centrifugal force .",
    "such a system is analogous to the high - spin meson states in hadronic physics where a quark and an antiquark rotate around each other .",
    "we have shown that in a system of two interpenetrating bec with a coupling drive , there exists a domain wall solution .",
    "the relative phase between the two condensates changes by @xmath0 as one travels through the wall . the wall solution is formally similar to the kink in the sine - gordon field theory , yet it is not topologically stable and can decay . in this respect , the wall is more similar to a soap film , which can spontaneously burst .    from the mathematical point of view , the domain walls discussed in this paper are similar to the ones which have been studied in particle physics .",
    "such domain walls appear at least in two contexts : in the theory of the hypothetical axion @xcite and in high - density quark matter @xcite .",
    "the similarity is that the domain wall solution arises from the spontaneous breaking of an approximate u(1 ) symmetry . in all cases",
    "the domain wall exists only if the explicit violation of the u(1 ) symmetry ( determined by the value of the rabi frequency in our case ) is small enough .",
    "the decay of the wall in all the examples occurs via hole nucleation .    as to the experimental realization of the domain wall",
    ", one could be optimistic since the estimated critical value of the rabi frequency , for densities and scattering lengths typical for the rubidium gas in recent experiments , is of the order 100 hz which is not too small .",
    "the width of the wall , which might be as small as a few @xmath82 m if the rabi frequency is not much smaller than critical , can be also accommodated inside condensates of the size characteristic of present - day experiments .",
    "the apparent immediate obstacle is still the creation of a system where two bec truly interpenetrate . in the recent experiments with trapped atomic gas",
    "the region of overlap between the two bec is still small .",
    "one can hope the technical problems of making a genuine two - component bec to be solved in the near future which would enable one to study the domain walls experimentally .",
