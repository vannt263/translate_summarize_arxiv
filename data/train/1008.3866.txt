    "the characterization of entanglement and the elucidation of its role in quantum computation remain formidable challenges , in spite of the conspicuous presence of this concept in quantum physics since the fundamental and instigating papers published by einstein , podolski , and rosen , as well as schrdinger , in 1935 @xcite .",
    "motivation for the understanding of this subtle concept is stimulated not only by its fundamental character , but also by its applications in quantum information  @xcite and , much specially , by the perspective that entanglement could be the key ingredient in the increased efficiency of quantum computing compared to classical computation for certain quantum algorithms @xcite .    in an entangled state",
    ", classical and quantum correlations may coexist .",
    "indeed , for instance , in the singlet state @xmath0 there is a perfect classical correlation between the first and the second qubit , namely if the first is in state @xmath1 the second is in state @xmath2 , and vice - versa .",
    "several measures of entanglement have been proposed , like the concurrence @xcite and the negativity @xcite . also , different criteria for the existence of classical correlations have been proposed @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of genuine classical correlations was associated to the non - vanishing of @xmath3-party correlation functions involving local observables of the system .",
    "based on this definition , it was shown that it is possible to have multiparty entangled states with no genuine classical correlations , as long as the number of parties is larger than two @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has become clear that entanglement does not exhaust the realm of quantum correlations .",
    "indeed , separable states can exhibit quantum correlations , which seem to play a role in the explanation of the power of some schemes of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "several quantifiers have been proposed for these quantum correlations , starting with the work by ollivier and zurek @xcite , who introduced the  quantum discord \" .",
    "intuitively , this measure quantifies , in a bipartite system , the minimum change in the state of the system and on the information of one of its parts induced by a measurement on the other part . for a state with zero quantum discord , it is possible to measure any of its parts without changing the state of the system .",
    "an example would be the state @xmath4 for which there exist one - dimensional complete projective measurements on both the first and second subsystem  namely , measurements on the basis @xmath5 for the first qubit and @xmath6 for the second qubit  that do not perturb the overall quantum state , nor the state of each part .",
    "the quantum discord of this state is zero : the state has only classical correlations .    on the other hand , for the state @xmath7",
    "it is clear that any projective measurement performed on the second qubit disturbs the state of the first qubit . in this case , quantum discord is different from zero .",
    "the same is true for the maximally - entangled singlet state , which is transformed into a statistical mixture upon measurement of any of the two qubits .",
    "an interesting implication of this concept is the demonstration that vanishing quantum discord is necessary and sufficient for completely positive maps  @xcite , that is , it is not necessary to assume , in the usual master equation description , that the initial state of system+environment is a product state . it could be a more general separable state , as long as the quantum discord vanishes .",
    "quantum discord has been calculated for several families of quantum states and compared with the entanglement @xcite .",
    "modified versions have been proposed , with different physical meanings @xcite .",
    "other measures of quantum correlations , involving non - orthogonal measurements ( positive operator - valued measurements - povm s ) and measurements on both qubits , have been introduced in the literature @xcite , and have been studied and compared with quantum discord in different situations : the dqc1 model of mixed - state quantum computation @xcite , and within the context of accelerated frames @xcite .",
    "we present in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantum and classical correlations ] these other quantifiers , as well as a precise definition of quantum discord .",
    "the existence of quantum correlations in the absence of entanglement is another subtle trait of quantum mechanics , still to be fully understood .    in this paper , we show that when two qubits interact with each other through a common environment and also through dipole forces , there is a peculiar dynamical behavior intertwining quantum correlations , classical correlations , and entanglement . for two qubits",
    "initially excited , quantum correlations show up as precursors of entanglement , growing up and then shrinking as entanglement belatedly appears . at this moment , classical correlations , even though non - vanishing , become practically negligible .",
    "the dynamics of quantum correlations is studied in terms of two distinct quantifiers , the above - mentioned quantum discord and the measured - induced disturbance ( mid ) , introduced by luo @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that the mid coincides with the quantum discord for part of the evolution .",
    "the dynamics of multiparty entangled systems interacting with independent environments that act on each of its parts is quite different from the time - dependent behavior of each individual component of the system . quite generally , the decay of entanglement is non - exponential , and it may lead to separability at finite times , before each part reaches its final state  @xcite .",
    "the finite - time disappearance of entanglement , sometimes called `` sudden - death of entanglement ''  @xcite was experimentally demonstrated by almeida et al .",
    "the dynamics of quantum correlations other then entanglement has also been analyzed , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "as the two qubits get closer , at a distance comparable to the radiated wavelenght , a different physical situation arises .",
    "the model of individual and independent environments does not correspond anymore to the physical reality : one must consider that the qubits interact with the same environment , and furthermore the interaction between the qubits , which depends on their physical characterization , must also be taken into account .",
    "this has important consequences for the dynamical behavior of the system .",
    "a common environment may entangle initially separable systems , even in the absence of direct interaction @xcite .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that the product state @xmath8 may be expressed as a sum of a singlet and a triplet component : @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ] and , since the singlet component does not decay under a common environment , a residual entanglement remains at asymptotic times  @xcite .",
    "this is not valid anymore for two initially excited atoms , since then the singlet component does not appear . in this case",
    ", one can show that the system remains separable throughout its evolution  @xcite .",
    "the situation changes dramatically , however , when dipole interactions between the two initially excited atoms are taken into account . in this case , it was shown that entanglement does emerge , but only after a time lag   @xcite .",
    "here we study the dynamic evolution of classical and quantum correlations corresponding to this peculiar behavior of entanglement . as mentioned before , three main results emerge from our work : ( i ) the belated appearance of entanglement is preceded by the build up of strong classical and quantum correlations , which so to speak prepare the scenario for the emergence of entanglement ; ( ii ) the interaction between the two initially excited qubits , indirectly through the environment and directly through dipole forces , leads to an entangled state that has extremely small classical correlations ; and ( iii ) although stemming from very different definitions , different quantifiers of quantum correlations coincide within some ranges of time as the system evolves : this is the case for the mid and the quantum discord .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantum and classical correlations ] .",

    "we present the master equation that describes the interaction of two qubits with a common environment and the main results concerning the dynamical behavior of several quantities that have been introduced to characterize entanglement and quantum correlations : concurrence , quantum mutual information , quantum discord , and measure - induced disturbance .",
    "we also consider in the same section the evolution of the classical correlations .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , while the appendices contain detailed demonstrations of some of the assertions made in the article .",
    "the total classical correlations between two random variables x , y are given by the classical mutual information : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the shannon entropy , with the probability distributions calculated from the joint one , @xmath12 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the joint entropy with @xmath16 the probability of both outcomes @xmath17 and @xmath18 happening .    using the bayes rule , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the conditional probability that the event @xmath21 occurs once the event @xmath22 has already occurred , the classical mutual information can be expressed equivalently as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the conditional entropy of @xmath21 given @xmath25 , with @xmath26 in this form , it becomes clear that the classical mutual information describes the difference in the ignorance about the subsystem @xmath21 before and after performing a measurement on subsystem @xmath25 .",
    "ollivier and zurek generalized these two equivalent expressions of the classical mutual information to quantum systems . equation ( [ infoclassica1 ] ) is easily generalized by replacing the probability distributions by density matrices and the shannon entropy by the von neumann entropy @xmath27 , thus obtaining : @xmath28 it is not straightforward to generalize eq .",
    "( [ infoclassica2 ] ) , since the definition of the conditional entropy @xmath29 involves specifying the state of the subsystem @xmath30 , knowing the state of the subsystem @xmath31 . in quantum theory",

    "furthermore , the information about the system @xmath30 is not perturbed by the measurement of system @xmath31 . however",
    ", a nonzero quantum discord implies that the measurement disturbs the state and part of the information about system @xmath30 that exists in the correlations between the subsystems @xmath30 and @xmath31 is lost .",
    "equation ( [ nonpert ] ) shows that the concept of quantum discord admits a simple physical explanation .",
    "however , this measure has an annoying feature : it is asymmetric under exchange of systems @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which should not be expected from a quantifier of quantum correlations .",

    "the quantum discord would be zero .",
    "this example also highlights the difference between separability and classicality , and clearly associates the existence of quantum correlations in a separable state with the presence of nonorthogonal states in one of the subsystems , as already mentioned by @xcite .",
