    "one of the major observational breakthroughs of the last decade has been the discovery of a large sample of quasars at @xmath4 ( fan 2006 ) , with the current record holder being quasar ulas j1120 + 0641 at @xmath5 ( mortlock et al .",
    "these observations have unquestionably shown that the most distant and luminous quasars are powered by gas accretion onto @xmath6 black holes ( jiang et al .",

    "+ such evidence poses thorny questions on the formation of these supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and on the detection and characterization of their lower mass ( @xmath7 ) ancestors ( e.g. tanaka & haiman 2009 ; volonteri 2010 , petri , ferrara & salvaterra 2012 ) .",
    "in fact , since at @xmath4 the universe is less than 1 gyr old , it is difficult to understand how smbhs have formed over such a short time scale . in hierarchical galaxy evolution models",
    ", bh growth can occur through mergers of nuclear bhs and by gas accretion . under the assumption that smbh progenitors are accreting no faster than the eddington rate on small seeds ( @xmath8 )",
    ", the latter must appear at very high redshift ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "smbh ancestors have yet to be detected , despite being predicted and extensively searched for ( e.g. cowie et al . 2013 ) .",
    "one interesting possibility is that ancestors are enshrouded by a thick gas and dust cocoon heavily absorbing their high energy radiation , therefore eluding optical / x - ray observations .",

    "j1148 is one of the most distant and luminous ( @xmath11 ) known quasars ( fan et al .",

    "continuum observations at 262 ghz of j1148 were performed using the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) with 6 antennas in may 2010 ( d configuration ) and 5 - 6 antennas in nov - dec 2012 ( c configuration ) .",

    "we use the quasar 1150 + 497 for phase and amplitude calibration .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was derived by observing several sources , namely : mwc349 , 3c84 , 0923 + 392 , 3c279 , 0851 + 202 , 3c273 , 1055 + 018 , 1144 + 542 , 3c345 .",

    "+ we serendipitously detected strong line emission with high significance ( 6.2@xmath25 ) in our data , perfectly centered at the sdss location of this source , at an observed frequency @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we estimate the continuum at 262 ghz through the line - free channels ( i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) of the total 3.5  ghz wide spectrum .",
    "we obtain a @xmath29 sensitivity of @xmath30  mjy  beam@xmath31 and a continuum flux of @xmath32  mjy .",
    "+ given the most accurate redshift determination ( @xmath33 ) for j1148 from the [ cii ] line ( maiolino et al .",
    "2005 ) , the frequency range in which the emission line is detected corresponds to @xmath34 , in the rest frame of the source .",
    "the co(1716 ) emission line ( @xmath35  ghz ) , as well as five @xmath36 rotational transitions ( @xmath37 ) , fall in this frequency interval . this line complex has been recently observed in ngc1068 , a nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ( hailey - dunsheath et al .",
    "according to that study , the combined line profile is largely ( @xmath38 ) dominated by the co(1716 ) line .",
    "therefore , we first assume the rest frame frequency of the co(1716 ) emission line and we fit the pdbi data with a gaussian function .",
    "we get a velocity full width at half maximum of fwhm=720@xmath39217kms@xmath31 , a peak flux of @xmath40=1.33@xmath390.43  mjy , and a redshift of @xmath41 .",
    "this converts into a total velocity  integrated flux s@xmath421.01@xmath43 jykms@xmath31 .",
    "+ compared to lower @xmath44 co transitions and the [ cii ] line in j1148 + 52 , the co(17 - 16 ) line is both blue - shifted ( @xmath45  km  s@xmath31 ) and broader ( @xmath46 km s@xmath31 vs. @xmath47 km s@xmath31 of co(7 - 6 ) ) .",
    "although these differences are marginal ( significance 1.8 and 1.6@xmath25 , respectively ) , they can be explained by the possible contamination from @xmath36 emission .",
    "in fact , our data can be very well described through a double gaussian . in the inset in the right panel of fig . 1",
    ", we show the spectrum rebinned to 88 km  s@xmath31 .",
    "the dotted line ( shaded red region ) represents the co(17 - 16 ) line ( @xmath48 ; fwhm@xmath49kms@xmath31 ) , while the dashed line ( blue shaded region ) denotes the oh@xmath1 line ( @xmath50 ; fwhm@xmath51kms@xmath31 ) .",
    "the quality of our data is not high enough to determine the errors on the 6 free parameters of the fit , above all because the emission is not centered in our observational set - up .",
    "however , it is reassuring to find that through the double gaussian model the properties of the co(1716 ) and oh+ lines ( inferred redshift and fwhm ) are much closer to the expected ones .",
    "moreover , in this way we can quantify the relative contribution of the co(1716 ) line to the total emission , that results to be @xmath52% .",
    "+ we further compute the map of the co(1716 ) and oh@xmath1 lines by integrating over the channels denoted by the red and blue shaded regions , respectively . in the inset in the left panel of fig",
    ". 1 ( on the top right ) , we show the 1@xmath25 levels of the co(1716 ) and oh@xmath1 emission through the red and blue lines , respectively ( 1@xmath53  jy  km  s@xmath31beam@xmath31 ; 1@xmath54  jy  km  s@xmath31beam@xmath31 , dotted blue lines represent -3@xmath25 levels from the oh@xmath1 map ) .",
    "we detect both emissions at 4.3@xmath25 . by integrating over the 3@xmath25 contours of both maps , we find that the total emission we detect is @xmath55% due to the co(17 - 16 ) transitions . + to summarize , the co(1716 ) line is contributing @xmath56% to the emission we detect . by conservatively considering 40% as our fiducial value , the total integrated flux s@xmath57 we observe correspondskms@xmath58mpc@xmath31 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 throughout ( planck collaboration 2013 ) . ] to a co(1716 )",
    "luminosity @xmath61 ( solomon et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the co spectral line energy distribution ( cosled ) is defined as the ratio of the ( @xmath62 ) co rotational transition luminosity to a fixed co transition , as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the cosled is considered a sensitive probe of the molecular gas kinetic temperature , @xmath63 , in turn controlled by radiative heating from stars and agn ( e.g. obreschkow et al . 2009 ) .",
    "more specifically , a higher @xmath63 boosts higher @xmath44 transitions , thus pushing the cosled maximum towards larger @xmath44 values .",
    "the presence of high energy ( @xmath64 ) photons emitted by an agn causes the co line intensities to rise well beyond @xmath65 , making these highly excited lines a tracer of quasar activity and a powerful diagnostics of x - ray dominated regions ( xdr ) ( e.g. schleicher et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in fig .  2 , we show the cosled observed in j1148 through filled circles .",
    "we adopt available radiative transfer results ( meijerink et al . 2005 ; 2007 ) to compute the cosled predicted by photo - dissociation regions ( pdr , i.e. excited by uv radiation field ) and xdr models .",
    "we explore different gas densities ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 in @xmath68 ) , uv fluxes ( @xmath69 in habing units of @xmath70 ) , and x - ray fluxes ( @xmath71 in @xmath72 ) , at the cloud surface .",
    "first , we try to reproduce the observed cosled with pure pdr models . in this case , the best fitting model ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , dashed line in fig .  2 ) .",
    "this result clearly shows that pdr models fail to reproduce our high - j ( j@xmath757 ) co line observations .",
    "in fact , in this case , we obtain @xmath76 , namely p@xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we consider a slightly more complex but physically plausible composite model , in which the molecular cloud ( mc ) emission is the sum of the contribution from a higher - density xdr region embedded in a more rarefied and extended pdr envelope . the solid line in fig .",
    "2 represents the best - fitting composite model to available data . in this case , we obtain @xmath78 , i.e. p@xmath79 . according to this model , individual mcs have a typical mass @xmath80 and a radius @xmath81 pc ; the xdr core ( @xmath82 ) is irradiated by an x - ray flux @xmath83 , while the fuv flux at the pdr surface ( @xmath84 ) is @xmath85 .",
    "the quoted errors must be considered as upper limits on the actual 1@xmath25 values , since the grids of pdr and xdr models are not sufficiently fine - grained to correctly determine the errors on the best fit model parameters . moreover",
    ", the limited number of co lines detected so far prevents us to fully characterize the uncertainties / degeneracies of the model parameters .",
    "additional observations of high - j co lines ( @xmath86 ) , more accurate xdr and pdr models , as well as improvements of xdr diagnostics ( e.g. oh@xmath1 ) will be crucial to further test our predictions .",
    "high - resolution , spatially resolved , vla observations of the co(32 ) line have discovered a molecular component of total mass @xmath87=2.2@xmath88m@xmath89 , extending up to a radius @xmath90  kpc from the center ( walter et al .",
    "2004 ) . by combining the results of our analysis with these observations",
    ", we can build up a simple model of the mcs in j1148 ( see fig .",
    "[ toymodel ] ) . according to this model ,",
    "the total numer of clouds is @xmath91 , their covering filling factor @xmath92 , and the number of clouds intercepted by the line of sight towards j1148 is @xmath93 .",
    "as x - ray observations of j1148 are not yet available , we can use the properties of j1148 mcs resulting from our modelling to predict its flux in the chandra soft x - ray band ( @xmath94 ) : @xmath95,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) x - ray flux integrated between @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the total optical depth of mcs along the los to x - ray photons , and @xmath99 is the optical depth of absorbers eventually intervening along the line of sight between the black hole and the clouds .",
    "we do not take into account the torus contribution to the total optical depth since j1148 is a type i quasar ( juarez et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we compute @xmath96 through the following equation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the x - ray bolometric correction ( hopkins et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath103 erg  s@xmath31 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath104 is the luminosity distance at the j1148 redshift .    to compute @xmath99 , we need to solve the following set of equations : @xmath105(1+\\frac{g_0^*}{g_0^{\\rm qso}})\\\\ f_x&=&\\frac{l_x}{4\\pi d_c^2}\\exp[-\\tau_{\\rm x , rf}(n_{\\rm h}^{\\rm abs})+\\tau_{\\rm x , rf}(n_{\\rm h}^{\\rm pdr})]\\\\ \\tau_{\\rm x}&=&\\tau_{\\rm x}(n_{\\rm h})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the ( fuv ) luminosity in the habing band ( 613.6 ev ) , obtained by assuming a quasar spectrum template ( telfer et al . 2002 ) and bolometric corrections , @xmath107 is the ( unknown ) cloud typical distance from the black hole , @xmath108 is the pdr optical depth to fuv photons , @xmath109 is the ( unknown ) absorbers column density , @xmath110 is the optical depth to x - ray photons with energies ( @xmath111 ) , and @xmath112  ( @xmath113 ) , is the stellar ( quasar ) contribution to the fuv radiation field ( walter et al .",
    "2009 ) , but our results are completely insensitive to this choice ] . for @xmath114 , we use the following equation : @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the optical depth to the rest frame photons ( @xmath97 ) which at the j1148 redshift are shifted in the chandra soft band ( @xmath117 ) , and @xmath118 $ ] is the column density of each cloud .",
    "finally , the total mc optical depth is given by @xmath119 .",
    "we find that @xmath120 is negligible with respect to @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , our model predicts that the intervening material between the black hole and the mcs has a relatively low hydrogen column density ( @xmath122 @xmath123 ) with respect to mcs intercepted along the line of sight ( @xmath124 @xmath123 ) . in conclusion , for j1148",
    ", we expect a flux @xmath125 in the soft chandra band . by performing similar calculations for the hard ( @xmath126 ) band ,",
    "we obtain @xmath127 .",
    "the next step is to understand whether we can use the co(1716 ) line to identify high-@xmath3 quasars that can not be detected in x - rays .",
    "we consider a scaled - down version of j1148 , namely a @xmath128 quasar powered by a black hole of mass @xmath129 times lower than j1148 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "we assume that the surrounding molecular gas mass is decreased by the same factor ( @xmath131 ) and that the quasar follows the @xmath132 relation observed in the local universe ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this implies a velocity dispersion @xmath133 , which corresponds at @xmath128 to a dark matter halo mass @xmath134 and to a virial radius @xmath135 .",
    "assuming angular momentum conservation , we then distribute the molecular gas in a radius @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a typical halo spin parameter . +",
    "albeit predicted and extensively searched , objects of this type have not been detected so far , most likely because they are enshrouded by a thick ( column density @xmath138 ) gas and dust cocoon heavily absorbing their optical / x - ray radiation ( comastri 2004 ) .",
    "if so , undetected smbh progenitors must have @xmath139 .",
    "we consider the subset of the above pdr+xdr models satisfying this condition and compute their expected co(1716 ) luminosity through the following equation : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the number of clouds intercepted along the line of sight , @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) is the co(1716 ) flux predicted by pdr ( xdr ) models , and @xmath144 is the solid angle subtended by the torus opening angle @xmath145 ( lawrence et al .",
    "1991 ) . + currently , the deepest x - ray survey reaches a flux threshold @xmath146 in 4 ms of chandra observing time ( xue et al . 2011 ) , while the flux detection limit of @xmath19 quasar observations typically is @xmath147 ( shemmer et al .",
    "2006 ; page et al .",
    "2013 ) . in fig .",
    "3 , we compare chandra versus alma detectability of faint or obscured @xmath148 ) smbh progenitors for different properties of their host galaxy mcs .",
    "if such sources do exist , their co(1716 ) line emission will be easily detectable by alma .",
    "for example , for a typical case in which @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( magenta diamond in fig .",
    "3 ) , our model predicts @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "hence , while this source is detectable with the alma full array in band 6 ( 211@xmath153 ) in 2.6 hr of observing time , its x - ray flux would remain unseen even in the deepest chandra observations obtained so far .",
    "this is because x - rays photons remain trapped in dense molecular gas , where they are efficiently reprocessed into lower energy photons and particles heating the gas and efficiently boosting the co(1716 ) line to detectable luminosities .",
    "our detection and its interpretation outline exciting possibilities for future discoveries of early smbh progenitors .",
    "such searches will be enabled by alma and future facilities as noema ( northern extended millimeter array ) and ccat ( cerro chajnantor atacama telescope , woody et al .",
    "we defer to a future work a detailed assessment of the optimal observational strategy and/or instrumental design to detect smbh ancestors through high - j co lines . here",
    ", we critically analyze the limits and uncertainties of our detection of the co(1716 ) line .",
    "2 , we have largely discussed the possible oh@xmath1 contamination of the co(1716 ) line .",
    "first of all , we underline that the presence of @xmath36 in j1148 lends further support to the proposed interpretation , namely that a strong contribution from xdrs is required to explain our observations , since @xmath36 emission / absorption is often ascribed to xdrs ( van der werk et al .",
    "2010 ; gonzalez - alfonso et al .",
    "+ we further note that our data require the xdr contribution to the observed cosled as far as the oh@xmath1 contribution to the serendipitous emission we detected is @xmath15430%",
    ". an higher contribution is disfavored by the double fit analysis , since the oh@xmath1 transition dominates the emission only if fwhm@xmath155kms@xmath31 , i.e. for fwhm values much larger than all the other fir lines detected so far in j1148 . clearly , to definitively establish the oh@xmath1 and co(1716 ) relative contribution deeper observations are required .",
    "+ we have also examined the possibility that the observed cosled can instead result from shock excitation of the gas ( meijerink et al . 2013 ; hailey - dunsheath et al . 2012 ; panuzzo et al .",
    "we can safely exclude this hypothesis based on the following arguments . in fig .",
    "2 , we compare the cosled of j1148 with those of three well known shock - dominated sources , typically starburst and seyfert galaxies ( as m82 or ngc1068 ) or merger systems ( ngc6240 ) . none of the sources shows the large high-@xmath44 line fluxes observed in j1148 and their cosled appears exceedingly flat .",
    "in addition , a key difference between shocks and radiative excitation by uv and/or x - rays is that shocks only heat the gas without affecting the temperature of dust grains ( meijerink et al .",
    "2013 ) . as dust is the primary source of ir emission , if excitation were due to shocks one would expect a large ratio of the co to ir luminosity .",
    "this is indeed measured in ngc6240 , which has an unusually large @xmath156 ratio , obtained by considering all co transitions up to the @xmath157 one . for j1148 , the rest - frame far infrared spectral energy distribution due to",
    "dust emission is extremely well sampled ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003b , robson et al .",
    "2004 , beelen et al .",
    "2006 ) , allowing for a precise measurement of the high ( @xmath158 ) fir luminosity in this source ( valiante et al .",
    "we integrate the best - fit cosled up to the @xmath157 transition for a fair comparison with ngc6240 .",
    "we obtain @xmath159 , which is @xmath1607 times lower than the one found in ngc6240 .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is very unlikely that the co(17 - 16 ) line of j1148 is powered by shocks . as a corollary ,",
    "given the characteristic shape of the xdr cosled , observing a prominent @xmath161 line in high redshift objects would lend strong support to the presence of an x - ray source .",
    "in fact , uv radiation is unable to substantially power lines with @xmath162 , and powerful , pervasive shocks affecting the large molecular masses in place would be required .",
    "+ we conclude that , in spite of some uncertainties , our detection of the co(1716 ) line is robust and possibly opens a new pathway to search for the elusive smbh progenitors .",
    "further support to our interpretation should come from the detection of other high - j co lines in j1148 and in other @xmath4 quasars .",

    "<S> we report the serendipitous detection of the co(1716 ) emission line toward the quasar sdssj114816.64 + 525150.3 ( j1148 ) at redshift @xmath0 obtained with the plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the co(1716 ) line is possibly contaminated by oh@xmath1 emission , that may account for @xmath2% of the total flux observed . </S>",
    "<S> photo - dissociation and x - ray dominated regions ( pdrs and xdrs ) models show that pdrs alone can not reproduce the high luminosity of the co(17 - 16 ) line relative to low - j co transitions and that xdrs are required . by adopting a composite pdr+xdr model </S>",
    "<S> we derive molecular cloud and radiation field properties in the nuclear region of j1148 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that highly excited co lines represent a sensitive and possibly unique tool to infer the presence of x - ray faint or obscured supermassive black hole progenitors in high-@xmath3 galaxies .    </S>",
