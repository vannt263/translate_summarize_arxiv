    "radio emission from seyfert galaxies traces energetic , mechanical processes occurring in the active nucleus .",
    "the radio continuum spectra of seyferts are almost invariably steep , consistent with optically - thin synchrotron emission . in those sources where the radio continuum has been resolved , the morphology is commonly linear , interpreted to trace a stream of ejected plasma , or a jet , originating from the central engine .",
    "for example ,",
    "most well - resolved seyfert radio sources are double or triple sources straddling the active nucleus .",
    "the radio emission of the nearest and brightest seyferts resolves into tightly collimated structures originating from the active nucleus , consistent with a jet interpretation ( e.g. , ngc  1068 : gallimore et al .",
    "1996 ; muxlow et al . 1996",
    "; wilson & ulvestad 1983 ; ngc  4151 : pedlar et al .",
    "1993 ; mrk  3 : kukula et al .",
    "there is evidence that seyfert radio jets impact the dense gas in the near - nucleus environment and affect the gas distribution , morphology , and ionization of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "the orientation of the radio jet is also the only straightforward measure of the symmetry axis of the active nucleus , useful for testing orientation - based unifying schemes for agns .",
    "early studies searching for differences between seyfert 1 s and 2 s ( @xcite 1978 ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) concluded that seyfert 2 s have stronger and larger radio sources than seyfert 1 s , however , these studies were biased by optical selection : weaker seyfert 2 galaxies were omitted from the samples .",
    "there was found to be little or no difference between seyfert 1 and 2 radio sources in follow - up studies which properly considered relatively unbiased , volume - limited samples ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite 1990 ) .",
    "more specifically , there is no statistically significant difference in the distribution of radio luminosity , and only a marginal difference in the distribution of radio source sizes , with seyfert 2 s tending to be slightly larger than seyfert 1 s ( although only at @xmath9 % significance , wilson 1991 ) .",
    "in contrast , unifying schemes predict that the radio jets in seyfert 2 s should appear larger in projection , since the unifying model orients the collimating disk more nearly edge - on in narrow - line agns .",
    "it is not simple to reconcile the statistics of radio sources with the unified scheme hypothesis .    while there is no tendency for the radio sources to orient in any preferred direction with respect to the plane of the host galaxy ( @xcite ) , the radio sources are commonly elongated in the same direction as the nlr ( @xcite 1988 ; @xcite ; @xcite 1988 ) , i.e. the inner part of the optical emission regions ( extending up to few kpc ) . in some seyfert  2s",
    "the nlr has a conical or bi - conical shape with the nucleus at the apex ( eg .",
    "@xcite ; pogge 1997 ) .",
    "@xcite ( 1994 ) showed that the radio axis is invariably co - aligned with the ionization cone axis for the 11 ionization cones known at that time .",
    "the alignment of the radio jet and nlr raises a question of energetics  does the radio jet ionize and heat the nlr significantly compared to ionizing radiation from the agn ? in several well - studied cases , there is a detailed morphological association between the nlr and the radio emission ( e.g. whittle et al .",
    "1988 , whittle 1989 , capetti et al . 1996 ; gallimore et al .",
    "currently , the numbers of such well - studied cases is too small to address questions of interaction and energetics in a statistically complete and meaningful sense .    to this end , tsvetanov et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "have recently assembled a volume - limited sample ( @xmath0 ) of well - classified seyfert galaxies .",
    "the main advantage of this sample is that all of the sources have been extensively observed in the optical with narrow - band imaging done with the eso ntt , 3.6 m and 2.2 m telescopes .",
    "this survey provides high - quality emission - line maps ( in and h@xmath10 + ) with a typical resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "the sample includes objects with and without known extended emission line regions , providing detailed information about the extent , morphology , and degree of ionization ( obtained from the /h@xmath10+ratio ) of the emission - line regions .",
    "it is therefore important to obtain for such a sample detailed radio images in order to perform a detailed comparison of the radio and optical morphology on arcsecond ( hundred - pc ) scales .    here",
    "we present a radio imaging survey of the tsvetanov et al .",
    "sample , made using the very large array ( vla ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) aperture synthesis telescopes .",
    "observing configurations and frequencies were chosen to match the @xmath12 1  resolution of the optical narrow - band observations .",
    "we discuss the radio properties and statistics for the 29 surveyed sources , and a more detailed comparison of the radio and optical properties will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the sample includes 51 well classified ( from their optical spectra ) seyfert galaxies south of declination @xmath13 and with redshift @xmath0 . more details about selection and optical observations of this sample",
    "are presented in tsvetanov et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , tsvetanov et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "the 29 sources listed in table  1 were observed with either the vla or atca , depending on their declination .",
    "one source , ngc  3393 , was observed with both arrays .",
    "the array configurations and frequencies were chosen to obtain a resolution of @xmath11  in order to match the resolution of the optical data .",
    "in particular , the vla was used in its b and b@xmath14a configurations , providing a resolution of @xmath12 1  at 6 cm ( 4.9  ghz ) . to obtain similar resolution with",
    "the atca required an observing frequency of 3.5  cm ( 8.6  ghz ) with the 6 km configuration . owing to missing short baselines in either array , our data are more sensitive to compact emission from the circumnuclear region but less sensitive to extended , diffuse emission .",
    "in addition , faint , diffuse emission from active spirals tends to have very steeply falling radio spectra with increasing frequency ; at observing wavelengths of 3.5 and 6  cm any diffuse emission will probably have dropped below our surface brightness detection limit .",
    "= 1truecm    * table 1 : vla observations ( 6  cm ) *    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,<,>,<,^,^ \" , ]      previous radio studies of volume - limited samples of seyfert galaxies find : a ) marginal or no statistically significant difference between the distributions of radio luminosities of seyfert 1s and 2s ; b ) seyfert  2 s galaxies tend to have a larger radio sources than seyfert  1s , although at @xmath15% significance level ; c ) the two types of seyferts have essentially the same distribution of spectral indices ( @xcite 1990 , rush et al .",
    "1996 ) although there seems to be some evidence that flat spectrum cores are more common in seyfert  1s than in seyfert  2s ( @xcite ) ; and d ) compact radio cores ( on the sub - arcsec scale ) are more common in seyfert  2s than in seyfert  1s ( r94 ) .    examining first the distribution of spectral index ( see histograms in fig .",
    "17 ) , we find a median value for the spectral index ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) of @xmath18 for seyfert  1s and @xmath19 for seyfert  2s .",
    "however , the two distributions are not significantly different under a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( 13% probability that the two distributions are not different ) .",
    "unfortunately , we have too few seyfert 1 s with measured spectral indices to compare the frequency of flat - spectrum cores .",
    "we also compared the distribution of radio sizes and powers ( see histograms in figs .",
    "18 and 19 respectively ) of seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies . to improve the fairness of the comparison",
    ", we only included sources out to a redshift of @xmath20  , at which the redshift distributions of seyferts 1 and 2 matched according to a k - s test . at marginal significance , we find that seyfert 2 radio sources tend to be more luminous than seyfert 1 radio sources ; the probability that seyferts 1 and 2 arise from the same parent distribution is @xmath21 for most two - sample tests , @xmath22 for the logrank test .",
    "ulvestad & wilson ( 1984a ) found a similar result for markarian seyferts , but they showed in a follow - up paper ( @xcite ) that the significance is reduced owing to the paucity of low - luminosity seyfert  2s in the markarian sample .",
    "inspection of the power - size diagram ( fig .",
    "12 ) suggests that any significance in the difference of radio powers owes to a handful of luminous seyfert  2s , but most seyferts 1 and 2 have comparable radio powers .",
    "formally , we measure mean log radio powers of @xmath23 for seyfert  2s , and @xmath24 for seyfert  1s .    in contrast",
    ", we measure a significant difference in radio sizes .",
    "all of the two - sample tests report a difference in parent populations to a significance of @xmath25 , with the exception of the logrank test , which is significant only to 87% .",
    "seyfert 2s tend to be larger , with a mean size of @xmath26  kpc , compared to seyfert 1s , mean size @xmath27  kpc .",
    "the errors on the mean sizes represent the dispersion in the intrinsic value .",
    "given the statistical agreement in the distribution of radio powers , it is natural to interpret the size difference in terms of an orientation unifying scheme .",
    "the prediction of this model is the nuclear axes of seyfert  1s are viewed more nearly pole - on , and so radio jets are foreshortened by projection .",
    "we have presented vla 6  cm and atca 3.5  cm radio data for 29 southern seyfert galaxies selected from a volume limited sample ( @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the resolution of the observations is about @xmath28 , similar to that of the ground - based , optical narrow band images .",
    "the new radio observations presented in this paper cover more than 50% of our southern ( @xmath29 ) volume limited ( @xmath0 ) sample of seyfert galaxies . when data available from the literature are added",
    "the coverage improves to greater than 80% .",
    "only 2 of the 22 newly observed sources are undetected in our radio observations .",
    "including data from the literature , we find 38% of the distance - limited sample is unresolved at arcsecond resolution , and most of the resolved objects ( 34% of the sample ) show , as expected , a linear structure .",
    "statistical comparisons are consistent with the picture that seyferts 1 and 2 arise from the same parent population of agn , but the radio jets of seyfert 1 galaxies are smaller in projection owing to their orientation .",
    "this model is not contrary to the power - size correlation , but , conversely , projection effects add noise to the measured correlation .",
    "an additional prediction is that , binned in radio power , seyfert 1s should be smaller than seyfert 2s .",
    "unfortunately , owing to the small number of sources per decade in radio power and the large number of limits at low radio power , we are unable to test this prediction with the current sample .    ma acknowledges the support of an australian post - graduate research award ( apra ) .",
