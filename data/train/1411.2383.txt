    "<S> , we calculate the chern - simons invariants of cyclic coverings of the hyperbolic twist knot orbifolds . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive some interesting results . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit formula of @xmath0-polynomials of twist knots are obtained from the complex distance polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> hence the edge polynomials corresponding to the edges of the newton polygons of a - polynomials of twist knots can be obtained . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the number of boundary components of every incompressible surface corresponding to slope @xmath1 appears to be @xmath2 . </S>"
