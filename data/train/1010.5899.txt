    "the first step towards the use of jets as probes of the properties of the hot and dense medium produced in heavy - ion collisions is to characterize the properties of the jets produced in vacuum .",
    "this characterization is by itself an important test of perturbative qcd and will also help to tune monte carlo generators at lhc energies .",
    "we are interested in studying the response of the medium to quark and gluon jets independently in order to test the theoretically predicted differences in energy loss @xcite@xcite due to their different color charge factor .",
    "the objective of this study is to test the feasibility of different methods , in proton - proton collisions , that allow to obtain jet samples enhanced in quark or gluon content .",
    "alice@xcite@xcite@xcite is a dedicated experiment at the lhc to study heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it has excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities@xcite , that makes it an ideal tool to study jet properties like fragmentation .",
    "the jet reconstruction presented here is based only on charged particles within the alice acceptance @xmath0 @xmath1 0.9 . in the future",
    ", alice will also be able to perform full jet reconstruction with the combination of tracking from the central barrel detectors and calorimetry with the emcal detector .",
    "the data sample used for this work consists of jet events in proton - proton collisions at @xmath2 tev produced with pythia@xcite using the set of parton distribution functions cteq4l@xcite .",
    "full detector simulation of these events was performed using aliroot@xcite in order to estimate the performance of the methods under realistic conditions .",
    "the jet finder used was the ua1 cone algorithm , using a cone radius @xmath3 of 0.4 , a seed of 4 gev and requiring a minimum jet transverse energy e@xmath4@xmath5e@xmath4 .",
    "] of 5 gev . in the following ,",
    "the parton association to jets was done by selecting the most energetic parton inside a subcone with @xmath60.3 around the reconstructed jet axis .",
    "the quark / gluon content of the sample is determined this way .",
    "the charged jet reconstruction was found to introduce a bias towards finding a larger fraction of the quark initiated jets compared to the full jet reconstruction .",
    "this bias was found to increase due to the use of a small cone radius .",
    "in the following subsections , the two enhancement methods studied will be described followed by a comparison of their performances .",
    "the second central moment of the transverse structure@xcite is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) . for each component @xmath7 ( @xmath8 )",
    "the second central moment is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : two ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : three ] ) , where the index @xmath9 corresponds to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the jet axis and the index @xmath12 runs over the charged tracks that are part of the jet , having a transverse momentum @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    figure [ fig : fig 2 ] shows the distribution of the mean values of @xmath17 as a function of e@xmath4 for quark , gluon and all jets .",
    "the tracks used to perform this analysis were charged tracks with a @xmath18 1 gev/@xmath19 and with @xmath0 @xmath1 0.9 .",
    "as one can observe from the distributions , gluon jets have on average a larger mean value of @xmath17 than quark jets over the whole range of e@xmath4 studied .",
    "this difference in @xmath20 is the basis of this enhancement method .     as a function of e@xmath4 using the same symbols and colours as in fig . 1 . ]     as a function of e@xmath4 using the same symbols and colours as in fig . 1 . ]",
    "the second method studied is based on a modified version of that proposed to be used with segmented calorimeters@xcite .",
    "the track counting algorithm is implemented in the following way : the tracks that compose a given jet , in this case tracks inside the cone radius around the jet axis , are ordered in decreasing magnitude of transverse momentum .",
    "then the transverse momentum of the ordered tracks is added until a certain fraction of e@xmath4 is recovered , in this case 90% .",
    "this minimum number of tracks is defined as the variable @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig 3 ] shows the distributions of the mean values of @xmath21 for quark , gluon and all jets .",
    "one can observe that the mean values of this variable are larger for gluon jets compared to quark jets of the same e@xmath4 .",
    "this way it is possible to select quark or gluon jets based on the multiplicity needed to recover 90% of the e@xmath4 .      for both methods , the strategy to select quark jets",
    "was based on setting an upper value on the variables so the resulting samples would be enriched in quark content , and gluon jets were selected by requiring a minimum value of @xmath21 or @xmath20 .    in order to compare the performance of both methods , their results for selecting quark jets at a given jet energy and achieving the same purity of the order of 60% to select quark jets were compared .",
    "the method of the second moment of the transverse structure is 30% less efficient than the track counting method , as shown in table 1 .    in the next step of the study",
    ", we tried to combine cuts using both variables to increase the discriminating power .",
    "the result , however , is that both variables were highly correlated . in the following",
    ", only the performance of the track counting method will be described comparing results using only monte carlo ( mc ) events and the results after the full reconstruction chain .",
    "in order to evaluate the enhancement power of the variable @xmath21 , the efficiency ( @xmath22 ) and purity ( @xmath23 ) for selecting quark / gluon jets was studied as a function of the cuts on @xmath21 .",
    "this study was done for a fixed value of the e@xmath4 , the value was chosen to be 20 @xmath24 5 gev .",
    "figures [ fig : fig 4 ] and [ fig : fig 5 ] show the results from the pure mc events and for the same events after the full detector simulation .     and @xmath23 for quark jets as a function of the cut on @xmath21 .",
    "results from pure mc are shown with black lines and open triangles and the results after the alice simulation with a blue line and full triangles . ]     and @xmath23 for quark jets as a function of the cut on @xmath21 .",
    "results from pure mc are shown with black lines and open triangles and the results after the alice simulation with a blue line and full triangles . ]    for gluons jets in figure [ fig : fig 4 ] , the first bin corresponds to not performing any cut . by setting the cuts ,",
    "the minimum value on the number of tracks necessary to recover 90% of the e@xmath4 is fixed . for the quark case , shown in figure [ fig :",
    "fig 5 ] , the last bin represents the result when no cut is applied and successive cuts are made towards the first bin , in this case setting an upper value for the value of @xmath21 .    as one can see , the effect of the detector response does not affect the performance of the method .",
    "table 2 shows an example of the purity achieved by setting cuts on @xmath21 , but one should keep in mind that the method is better suited to disentangle jets produced by quark or gluon with higher e@xmath4 .",
    "it is in the high energy regime where the differences in the properties of quark and gluon jets are larger using @xmath21 ( see figure [ fig : fig 3 ] ) .",
    "the feasibility of a method to obtain samples enriched on quark or gluon content has been studied .",
    "it was shown using a full simulation of alice that it is possible to use a tagging variable based on charged track multiplicity to obtain jet samples enhanced in quark or gluon content in proton - proton collisions . for 20 gev jets it is possible to increase the purity of gluon jets up to 90% and of quarks jets up to 36% having efficiencies of 18% and 63% respectively .",
    "using higher e@xmath4 it would be possible to obtain samples with higher purities of quark jet content .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath21 tagging method biases the jet samples towards having a certain structure , i.e. soft gluon jets and hard quark jets .",
    "however @xmath21 can also be used as a jet structure observable that can be studied to compare jets from proton - proton collisions with those produced from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the author thanks c. blume and c. klein - bsing for fruitful discussions , comments and their interest in this study .",
    "this work was supported by the helmholtz research school for quark matter studies ."
