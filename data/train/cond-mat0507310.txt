    "we have used mean field theory to calculate the changes in the hall resistivity of a two dimensional system which undergoes a spin density wave instability .",
    "the model studied was chosen to be appropriate to the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "the important physics is that as @xmath4 is decreased below a critical value @xmath6 , the fermi surface is rearranged ( fig [ fig : fermi surface ] ) , leading to changes in @xmath8 .",
    "these changes were discussed , in the context of a theory of @xmath119 , by bazaliy _",
    "et al _ , @xcite and the related discussions , in the context of the d - density wave model of cuprates , were given by ref . .",
    "the new results presented here include consideration of a wide range of dopings and gap values ( fig [ fig : hall ] ) , a systematic treatment of all relevant effects ( sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] ) , a discussion of the weak field - strong field crossover ( sec .",
    "[ sec : weak field limit ] ) , a treatment of precursor effects ( sec . [ sec : normal state region ] ) , and detailed application of the model to the electron - doped cuprates ( fig [ fig : hall ] and conclusion ) .",
    "we note , unfortunately , that the specifics of the critical behavior and weak to strong field crossover will be visible ( at presently accessible fields @xmath287 t ) only at samples doped very close ( @xmath288 ) of the critical doping , and at the present level of sample purity , these effects will be complicated by magnetic breakdown .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "suggest @xmath289 while the data of ref .",
    "indicate @xmath290 and is most probably @xmath291 .",
    "thus the gap apparently opens quite fast with doping .",
    "however , important discrepancies remain between data and calculation . at @xmath251",
    "our calculation shows @xmath292 ( as expected for a fermi surface with one electron pocket containing @xmath4 electrons ) .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "are qualitatively consistent with this trend , but are offset , suggesting that the actual doping is slightly lower than the nominal one .",
    "the @xmath114 data point of ref .",
    "is qualitatively inconsistent with theory . also , the magnitude reported @xcite of @xmath8 at @xmath10 is inconsistent with theory .",
    "one expects that as @xmath4 is increased beyond @xmath6 , @xmath8 should revert to the band value , @xmath293 .",
    "while the sign and order of magnitude are correct , the numerical value is too large ; there is no reasonable choice of band parameters which reproduces the magnitude to better than a factor of two .",
    "our work suggests several important directions for future research . on the experimental side",
    ", we suggest that our finding that @xmath292 for @xmath251 can be used to determine the actual doping of lightly doped samples ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "we also note that experiments which pinned down the behavior in the @xmath295 regime and more precisely located @xmath36 would be very helpful .",
    "finally , clarifying the behavior at @xmath10 is potentially of considerable interest , as it gives ( in principle ) evidence of the modification of the fermi suface by finite range sdw correlations . on the theoretical side ,",
    "important directions include combining the present considerations with those of ref .",
    "to obtain a theory of the nernst effect , and improving the theoretical treatment of the sdw precursor effects .",
