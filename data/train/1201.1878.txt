    "the asymptotic inequality shows that the estimation error is lower bounded by the standard deviation @xmath67 of the prior distribution : the same precision of a strategy that just takes a random guess ( according to the prior distribution ) for the parameter to estimate .",
    "therefore , sub - heisenberg schemes are useless in this regime : one can attain the same precision just by `` guessing '' the parameter .",
    "having discussed the general behavior of the bound  ( [ boundnew ] ) for large and small @xmath68 , here we analyze some examples of prior distributions for which the function @xmath39 can be explicitly evaluated .",
    "this allows us to study regimes which are intermediate between hpi and lpi , showing that sub - heisenberg strategies can deliver advantages which , at most , are limited to a ( small ) constant factor with respect to the prior accuracy .    probably the most interesting case is when one has no prior information about the true value of the parameter , which corresponds to a uniform prior @xmath6 of width @xmath7 with equal weight for all possible values  @xcite . in this case , we have @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 otherwise .",

    "[ f:1 ] ) : even assuming that a sub - heisenberg strategy could reach ( [ l3 ] ) , this will only provide a relative gain of about @xmath0 with respect to the initial uncertainty .",

    "[ f:2 ] we report the results obtained for gaussian and for a bimodal step - like prior distribution . in all cases",
    "we record maximum gains of order 2 over the prior uncertainties .",
    "using the quantum zz bound recently introduced in  @xcite we have shown that , independently of the prior information available at the beginning of the protocol , the resulting accuracy can not beat the heisenberg scaling @xmath41 in the lpi regime ( which is arguably the most relevant for practical implementations ) .",
    "moreover , we have shown that in the other cases where the prior is sufficiently large to allow for a sub - heisenberg scaling , the resulting accuracy can not attain a significant enhancement over the one available before starting the estimation procedure .",
    "a similar analysis can be done by replacing @xmath30 with the standard deviation @xmath82 of the generator @xmath20 .",

    "it follows again that in the asymptotic regime @xmath73 one has @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a constant that does not depend on the prior .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath56 , and assuming a single - mode prior , the bound becomes @xmath89 , showing that the initial uncertainty again determines the scaling of the accuracy .",

    "@xcite ) and the second from the fact that the trace distance is decreasing under the action of partial trace . replacing this into ( [ mankei2 ] ) and using  ( [ speed ] )",
