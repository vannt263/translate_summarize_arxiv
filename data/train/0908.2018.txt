    "in recent times , laser cooling and trapping of atoms has become an area of active research @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the cold atomic sample is one of its most important characteristics and several methods have been proposed and used for its determination .",
    "a well - known technique of measuring this temperature is the time - of - flight ( tof ) method @xcite .",
    "it is significant to mention that the first evidence for bose einstein condensate ( bec ) was emerged from tof measurements @xcite .",
    "most of the samples of cold atoms are initially prepared in magneto - optical traps and the atomic cloud is allowed for a thermal expansion after its release from the trap .",
    "these so - called time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements are performed either by acquiring the absorption signal of the probe laser beam through the falling and expanding atomic cloud , or by measuring the fluorescence of the atoms excited by the resonant probe light .",
    "most of the theoretical analyses of tof measurements are as follows . to find the shape of the absorption tof signal",
    ", one assumes to start with the initial gaussian position and velocity distributions of atoms in the trapped sample .",
    "the initial probability distribution of finding an atom in the phase space volume element with coordinates ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) is given by @xmath2 here for simplicity , we consider the one - dimensional case .",
    "the gaussian width @xmath3 of the velocity distribution is associated with the temperature @xmath4 of the cloud by the relation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 stands for the atomic mass and @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant . using the newton s equations for ballistic motion of a particle accelerated by the earth s gravitational field ( in the vertical @xmath8-direction )",
    ", the velocity is obtained in terms of the time of flight as @xmath9 substituting the above expression for @xmath10 from eq.([tofdist2 ] ) in eq.([tofdist1 ] ) , and then finally integrating over @xmath0 , one can obtain the tof distribution at an arbitrary distance @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 figure [ curvetof ] shows a typical tof or arrival time distribution for cold sodium atoms .",
    "this kind of purely classical analyses are adopted in most of the discussions on tof measurements where arrival time of atomic or sub - atomic particles is treated as an elementary well - defined , unique , and classical quantity . also , the theoretical treatments of the tof distribution that can be obtained using , for instance , the green s function method @xcite or any semiclassical method @xcite , however , are equivalent to the tof distribution obtained by using newton s equations for ballistic motion of particles @xcite . the interpretations or theoretical analyses of the results of the various tof experiments",
    "@xcite with molecular , atomic or sub - atomic particles where classical trajectories are inferred from newtonian mechanics remain debatable , especially in the domain of small atomic masses and low temperatures where quantum mechanical effects should be significant and quantum tof distribution can not be reproduced with classical or semi - classical analyses .",
    "= 3.7in=2.7 in    0.5 cm here we provide an example in the context of bec matter - wave interference , where a quantum analysis for tof is necessary .",
    "we propose a scheme for measuring the tof distribution of a freely falling atomic bec prepared in non - classical schrdinger - cat states . the interference in the tof distribution ( or signal )",
    "can then be observed by taking a note or record of the particle counts over various _",
    "tiny time - windows _ at a fixed detector location .",
    "this is different from the interference between two freely expanding bec s observed @xcite in _ space _ after a definite time of free fall of the condensates .",
    "coherent splitting of bec atoms with optically induced bragg diffraction have been done experimentally @xcite .",
    "the _ spatial coherence _ of a bec is measured using interference technique by creating and recombining two spatially displaced , coherently diffracted copies of an original bec @xcite .",
    "0.5 cm as mentioned above , most of the experiments ( particularly when matter - waves are associated with centre - of - mass motion or external motion of massive quantum particles ) demonstrate matter - wave interference by showing the intensity variation at an extended region of detection space at a fixed time . in the present paper , in contrast , we predict and quantify the matter - wave interference in the center - of - mass motion by calculating the _ time distribution _ of matter - wave arrival probability at some fixed spatial point .",
    "more specifically , we discuss here the bec matter - wave interference in the tof distribution or _",
    "arrival time distribution _ since bec as a source of coherent matter waves is already routinely demonstrated and thus may be an ideal candidate to show interference signal in the time domain ( arrival - time distribution ) .",
    "we use here a particular quantum approach to calculate the tof distribution and in our analysis we do not use at any point classical or semiclassical ingredients .",
    "we consider the free fall of matter - wave associated to quantum particles represented by an initial schrdinger - cat state which is the linear superposition of two mesoscopically distinguishable gaussian wave packets peaked around different heights viz . ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 along the vertical z - axis .",
    "then after a certain height of free fall ( evolution under the potential @xmath15 ) of the schrdinger cat , we calculate the quantum tof distribution at a given detector location @xmath11 . during the free fall ,",
    "the distinct superposed wave packets of the schrdinger cat overlap or interfere in space , so it is natural to expect that they will also interfere in the _ time of fall _ showing an interference pattern in the quantum tof distribution .    0.5",
    "cm we take this particular example of matter - wave interference in the discussion of quantum tof distribution to pinpoint the necessity of a quantum analysis .",
    "so , the need for a quantum analysis of tof distribution is not merely a conceptual but a practical issue , asking how to predict the tof distribution using only classical and semi - classical ingredients in a purely quantum scenario like this ( interference in the tof distribution for quantum particles ) .",
    "now , in spite of the emphasis of quantum theory on the observable concept , there is no commonly accepted recipe to incorporate time observables and their probability distributions in the quantum formalism , and there is considerable difficulty and debate over the issue of defining time ( for example , tunneling time , decay time , arrival time ) as an observable @xcite . even for the simplest case of arrival time problem",
    "there is no unique way to calculate the probability distribution in the quantum formalism @xcite . despite this",
    ", many researchers have evidently not been discouraged from seeking an expression for the arrival time distribution ( or the quantum tof distribution ) within a consistent theoretical framework .",
    "several logically consistent schemes for the treatment of the arrival time distribution have been formulated , such as those based on axiomatic approaches @xcite , operator constructions @xcite , measurement based approaches @xcite , trajectory models @xcite and probability current density approach @xcite .",
    "we will use here probability current density approach to calculate the quantum tof distribution which is logically consistent and also physically motivating .",
    "0.5 cm the main purpose of our paper is two - fold . first",
    ", our proposal to experimentally observe or quantitatively predict the matter - wave interference in the time domain , specifically in the tof distribution is itself quite significant which has not been explored in the current literature to the best of our knowledge .",
    "bec as a source of coherent matter waves is already routinely demonstrated in spatial interference experiments , so bec will also be an ideal candidate to show the interference in the tof distribution .",
    "second , we have just mentioned that there is an inherent nonuniqueness within the formalism of quantum mechanics for calculating the tof or _",
    "arrival time _ distribution .",
    "it remains an open question as to what extent these different quantum mechanical approaches @xcite for calculating the time distributions can be tested or empirically discriminated .",
    "our proposal of measuring matter - wave interference in tof distribution has the potential to empirically resolve ambiguities inherent in the theoretical formulations of the quantum tof distribution . in this respect",
    ", it would be interesting if the prediction of bec matter wave _ interference _ in the tof distribution ( calculated from different quantum approaches ) be verified in actual experiments .",
    "we begin our analysis with the standard description of the flow of probability in quantum mechanics , which is governed by the continuity equation derived from the schrdinger equation given by    @xmath16    the quantity @xmath17=@xmath18 defined as the probability current density corresponds to this flow of probability . in one dimension ,",
    "the current density @xmath19 tells us the rate at which probability is flowing past the point @xmath20 .",
    "so , interpreting the one dimensional continuity equation in terms of the flow of physical probability , the born interpretation for the squared modulus of the wave function and its time derivative suggest that the arrival time distribution of the particles reaching a detector located at @xmath21 can be calculated @xcite using the probability current density @xmath19 . it should also be noted that @xmath19 can be negative , hence one needs to take the modulus sign in order to use the above definition .",
    "our aim here is to derive an expression for the tof distribution through the quantum probability current density for the atomic bec representing the mesoscopic schrdinger cat and showing the interference in tof signal .",
    "probability current density approach to the tof distribution is also justified by the bohmian model of quantum mechanics in terms of the causal trajectories of individual particles @xcite . although the schrdinger probability current density is formally nonunique up to a total divergence term @xcite , the current can be uniquely fixed if one calculate the current in the non - relativistic limit of a proper relativistic wave equation which provide appropriate spin - dependent corrections to it @xcite .",
    "we ignore this small spin - dependent contribution here in our present discussion , as the estimated magnitude of the spin - dependent current is roughly @xmath22 to @xmath23 times smaller than the schrdinger current .",
    "it was emphasized that the probability current density approach not only provides an unambiguous definition of arrival time at the quantum mechanical level @xcite , but also adresses the issue of obtaining the proper classical limit of the tof of massive quantum particles @xcite .",
    "0.5 cm now , to keep the discussion concise , here we restrict ourselves to the case of one - dimensional motion , but our resulting conclusion does not depend on three - dimensional extension which will be straightforward as discussed later at the end of this section .",
    "a magnetically trapped bec as a source of coherent matter wave or atom laser , where a macroscopic number of atoms occupy the same ground state is now routinely available . after being released from the trapped bose - einstein condensates ,",
    "matter waves fall freely due to the gravity .",
    "if the atomic beam is well collimated , we can use a one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite for the evolution of condensate wavefunction @xmath24 with the gravitational potential , @xmath25 where @xmath26 provides the density profile of the bec , @xmath6 denotes the atomic mass , @xmath27 the gravity acceleration , and @xmath28 the inter - atomic interaction strength . in our present discussion we consider condensate of non - interacting bosons and we neglect @xcite the effects of inter - atomic interaction @xmath28 on the freely falling condensate . in the bec ,",
    "the whole complex is described by one single wave function @xmath24 ( a macroscopic wave function of the condensate ) exactly as in a single atom , and we can speak of coherent matter in the same way as of coherent light in the case of a laser . to show _ interference _ in the quantum tof signal for the freely falling bec , we consider the initial state of the bec be prepared in a schrdinger - cat state which is the coherent superposition of two mesoscopically distinguishable states in the configuration space : @xmath29 , \\label{wavefn0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 @xmath31 are the gaussian wave packets centered around @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath32 is the initial position spread . a description of the initial 1d wavefunction for two separated bec s using",
    "the gaussian form ( [ wavefn0 ] ) has been made , for example , by the authors of @xcite , where they consider all the non - interacting bosons are prepared to be condensed in the ground state of the harmonic trap @xcite . for simplicity , we take @xmath33 which implies that after coherent splitting of the original bec , each component has equal number of atoms",
    ". then the value of the normalization constant @xmath34 as we have mentioned , the schrdinger - cat state of matter was generated for a bec represented by superposition of spatially separated states and the superposition was verified @xcite by detecting the quantum mechanical interference ( _ in space _ ) between the localized wave packets separated by a mesoscopic distance . under the experimental situtations ( where the spatial coherence of the bec was measured using interference technique by creating and recombining two spatially displaced , coherently diffracted copies of an original bec ) discussed by the authors of @xcite",
    ", the bec wave function can be written as a linear superposition of spatially separated wave packets @xcite which may be inferred as a true macroscopic schrdinger cat . now considering the free fall of the coherently splitted bec under gravity , we calculate the time evolution of the schrdinger - cat state ( [ wavefn0 ] ) according to equation ( [ pita ] ) with @xmath35",

    ", we obtain the quantum tof distribution @xcite at a detector location @xmath11 for the spatially separated bec schrdinger cat falling freely under gravity given by @xmath51    0.5 cm exactly similar expression for quantum tof distribution can be obtained for a three dimensional analysis of the problem by considering the form of the initial wave function @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are now three dimensional gaussian wave packets separated along the vertical @xmath57-axis , having peaks around the points @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the value of the normalization constant @xmath60 remains the same as that in eq.([normal ] ) .",
    "one can then obtain the three dimensional schrdinger time evolved wave function under the gravitational potential .",
    "the quantum tof distribution can then be calculated again using the three dimensional quantum current . interpreting again the three dimensional continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) in terms of the flow of physical probability",
    ", one can define the quantum tof distribution for the atoms crossing a surface element @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "it is important to mention here that the quantum flux density @xmath62 have been identified with the `` time distribution '' of particles crossing the surface element @xmath61 by daumer _",
    "@xcite , who were applying bohm model to the scattering problem for a quantum particle in three dimension .",
    "hence quantum tof distribution for the atoms reaching at a finite surface plane @xmath63 in three - dimension will be given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the unit vector normal to the surface .",
    "the quantum tof distribution for the atoms reaching the xy plane ( @xmath66 ) after a certain height ( @xmath11 ) of free fall is then given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the z - component of the three dimensional probability current density at a fixed height @xmath11 . by evaluating the integral of eq.([pi1 ] )",
    ", one can see that @xmath69 is exactly the same as the quantum tof distribution @xmath70 obtained for one dimensional analysis ( [ pi ] ) . to understant more clearly the origin of this interference in tof ,",
    "let us consider the propagation ( evolution ) of individual wave packets @xmath71 and @xmath72 under the gravitational potential .",
    "then one will have two distinct tof distributions having separate mean arrival times .",
    "this is because the peaks of the component wave packets @xmath71 and @xmath72 take different times to reach the detector at @xmath11 , since they are spatially separated along the vertical z - axis , and the interference in tof arises due to the superposition of these two wave packets . in this setup , the cross term ( interfering term ) in the quantum tof distribution arises from the relative phase of the component wave packets ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) along z - direction , as only z - componets of the component wave packets differ in the time evolution and continue to develope the relative phase , and this relative phase is not cancelled out when we perform the integration over xy - plane .",
    "the interference pattern in the quantum tof distribution can be detected by using a probe laser , focused in the form of a sheet underneath the falling bec atoms in the xy - plane at @xmath11 .",
    "when the trapping forces are turned off , the bec atoms will fall through the laser probe under the influence of gravity .",
    "it is then possible to detect the fluorescence from the atoms excited by the resonant probe light as they reach the detection sheet .",
    "the fluorescence can be measured as a function of time to determine the tof distribution .",
    "for this setup , one can also consider a situation where the detection is made in the yz - plane ( @xmath73 ) at a fixed @xmath21 .",
    "in that case , quantum tof distribution ( say , @xmath74 ) can be obtained from the x - component of the three dimensional current ( @xmath75 ) integrated over yz - plane using eq.([tof ] ) . by evaluating that integral",
    ", one can see that there will be no interference in the quantum tof distribution @xmath74 under this situation .",
    "this is because the interference term in the quantum tof distribution is wiped out when we perform the integration over the yz - plane .    0.5 cm next",
    ", we consider another setup in three dimension where the superposed wave packets @xmath55 and @xmath56 are separated along the horizontal x - axis , having peaks around the points @xmath58 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "this situation is analogous to the experimental setup of ref.@xcite where bec interference was observed in _ space _ at a fixed time . for this geometry",
    ", one can again calculate the three dimensional schrdinger time evolved wave function under the gravitational potential . the quantum tof distribution ( [ tof ] ) can then be calculated again using the three dimensional quantum current . for this setup , we again consider the detection of the particles at a surface plane ( xy - plane with @xmath77 ) at @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", quantum tof distribution ( say , @xmath78 ) can be obtained from the z - component of the three dimensional current integrated over xy - plane using eq .",
    "( [ tof ] ) . by evaluating that integral",
    ", one can see that there will not be any interference at all in the quantum tof distribution @xmath78 .",
    "the interference term in the quantum tof distribution is wiped out when we perform the integration over the xy - plane .",
    "this is because for this setup , the individual wave packets @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not separated along the vertical z - axis , so they will have the same tof distribution with the same mean arrival time to reach the detection plane at @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we do not expect any interference in the quantum tof distribution detected at the horizotal plane at @xmath11 when we consider the superposition of the horizontally separated wave packets .",
    "the interference term in the quantum tof distribution , in this case , is wiped out when we perform the integration over the xy - plane , even though one can observe the interference in space at a fixed time . for this setup",
    ", one can also consider a situation where the detection is made in the yz - plane ( @xmath79 ) at a fixed @xmath21 . in that case",
    ", quantum tof distribution ( say , @xmath80 ) can be obtained from the x - component of the three dimensional current integrated over yz - plane using eq.([tof ] ) .",
    "for this situation , although we will see the presence of some interfering terms in the expression of quantum tof distribution @xmath80 , the intensity to observe this interference will be very low , as only a small fraction of the condensate atoms will arrive at the detection yz - plane at @xmath21 due to free expansion ( free particle motion ) of the wave packets .",
    "one can also check that the quantum tof distribution @xmath80 will have exactly the same expression as @xmath81 of ( [ pi ] ) with @xmath82 ( no gravity ) and with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath21 .",
    "we will show numerically in the next section that gravity plays an important role in our setup to pull down the vertically separated superposed condensate toward the detection plane at @xmath11 .",
    "0.5 cm hence the only two situations ( in our above discussion ) where we see the presence of interference in three dimensions are the quantum tof distribution @xmath83 and @xmath80 .",
    "now , @xmath83 is exactly the same as @xmath81 and @xmath80 is also same as @xmath81 with @xmath82 and with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath21 .",
    "so the whole characteristic of the interference pattern in quantum tof distribution hinges upon the form of @xmath81 . in the next section",
    "we study numerically the parameter dependence of the quantum tof distribution @xmath81 and the physical interplay between these parameters .",
    "quantum tof distribution @xmath70 of the freely falling atomic bec schrdinger cat is plotted ( fig.[becdf ] ) at a detector location @xmath84 cm with different values of wave packet separation @xmath85 .",
    "we see clear signature of interference in the quantum tof distribution arising due to the terms @xmath86 and @xmath87 of ( [ purecross ] ) in the expression for quantum probability current density ( [ pi ] ) and ( [ pure ] ) . during free fall ,",
    "the spatially separated wave packets of the bec schrdinger cat overlap or interfere in space and hence they also interfere in the time of fall showing an interference pattern in the quantum tof distribution .",
    "the quantum tof distribution @xmath70 may be visualized as a coherent pulse of bec atoms .",
    "the interference pattern in the quantum tof signal ( fig.[becdf]a ) is very sharp for a typical set of parameter values , for example , @xmath88 cm , @xmath89 m , @xmath90 m , and the pattern disappears ( fig.[becdf]f ) when the separation between the bec superposed wave packets is decreased to @xmath91 m for the above mentioned parameter values .",
    "we can see from the oscillatory factor @xmath49 ( [ delta ] ) in ( [ purecross ] ) that the number of oscillations and hence the number of fringe increases in the tof distribution @xmath81 ( [ pi ] ) as one increase the separation @xmath85 .",
    "the interference effect arises mainly because of two factors : one is the temporal overlap @xmath92 ( [ overlap1 ] ) and the other is the oscillatory factor @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath85 is very small , the overlap @xmath92 is very high , but the oscillatory factor @xmath49 becomes small . as a consequence ,",
    "the oscillation frequency is too slow or the oscillation period is too large , and we do not see any oscillatory effect in the temporal overlap region of the wave packets .",
    "number of oscillations increases as one increases @xmath85 , but again after a certain value ( @xmath93 m ) of separation there will be no interference as the overlap @xmath92 becomes very small in that case .            from fig .",
    "[ mass1 ] , we see that the interference pattern in quantum tof signal gradually disappears as one increases the mass @xmath6 of the atoms .",
    "figure [ becsf ] shows the quantum tof distribution for different values of wave packet width from @xmath90 m to @xmath94 m .",
    "it is clear from fig.[becsf ] that the number of fringe and the contrast of interference pattern in quantum tof distribution decreases as one increases the value of the initial widths ( @xmath32 ) of the wave packets .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to see the interference for a larger value of @xmath32 .",
    "for example , if one chooses @xmath95 m , then to observe good interference pattern ( with good contrast and having considerable number of fringe ) in @xmath81 , the separation @xmath85 needs to be considered in the range of @xmath96 m to @xmath97 m , with the detector placed at a longer distance ( @xmath98 cm ) for a fixed mass of sodium atoms .",
    "0.5 cm the interference in @xmath81 is sensitive to the parameters @xmath32 and the atomic mass @xmath6 , the detector location @xmath99 and the separation @xmath85 .",
    "we repeat here that the interference in @xmath81 arises mainly because of the temporal overlap @xmath92 ( [ overlap1 ] ) and the oscillatory factor @xmath49 ( [ delta ] ) . to increase the temporal overlap @xmath92 , one has to find the condition under which the spreading of the wave packet increases : small @xmath32 , lighter mass atoms , distant detector location ( large @xmath99 ) will be helpful in this regard to enhance this effect",
    ". the oscillatory factor @xmath49 can be increased either by reducing the value of @xmath32 , or by increasing the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath99 . actually , when one considers higher values of the parameter @xmath32 , then the temporal overlap @xmath92 and the oscillatory factor @xmath49 both decrease .",
    "this is because for larger values of the parameters @xmath32 ( or mass @xmath6 ) , the spreading effect ( [ spread ] ) and hence the temporal overlap @xmath92 becomes small .",
    "as a result , the wave packets try to localize ( in time as well as in space ) more strongly causing the interference effect to be small .",
    "also , for higher values of @xmath32 , the oscillatory factor @xmath49 will be too small due to the presence of @xmath100 in the denominator of @xmath49 ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "then one has to allow the bec to travel a longer distance ( by increasing @xmath99 ) to develope some temporal overlap of the wave packets , and also increasing @xmath99 helps us to increase @xmath49 ( [ delta ] ) . for higher values of @xmath32 , the parameter @xmath49",
    "should also be increased by increasing the value of the separation @xmath85 , keeping in mind that there is a considerable temporal overlap @xmath92 .",
    "the temporal overlap gets reduced if one increases the separation @xmath85 too much .",
    "so , even if there is a delicate choice of the parameters , one can observe the interference for a wide range of parameter values .        0.5 cm it is significant to mention here that gravity plays an important role in our setup to observe the interference in the tof distribution . in fig.[gravity0 ] we plot the time distribution @xmath81 for @xmath82 ( no gravity ) and compare it with fig.([becdf]d ) where we plot @xmath81 in the presence of gravity with the parameter values same as that of fig.[gravity0 ] .",
    "we see that the magnitude of @xmath81 ( in the absence of gravity ) is roughly @xmath22 times smaller than that obtained for gravitational free fall case for @xmath84 cm .",
    "the reason for this is that the magnitudes of @xmath101 and @xmath102 become very small ( roughly @xmath22 times ) in the absence of gravity .",
    "this magnitude becomes @xmath23 times smaller if we consider the detector location at @xmath103 cm .",
    "actually , in the absence of gravity , there will be free particle motion and expansion of the wave packets in every direction .",
    "so , if one tries to observe the interference in the quantum tof distribution in the absence of gravity , the intensity of that interference pattern will be too faint to be observed as only a small fraction of the condensate atoms will arrive at the detector .",
    "hence , in our setup , gravity plays an important role which helps to pull down the condensate towards the detection plane .",
    "to summarize , in this work we propose a scheme to experimentally observe matter - wave interference in the time domain , specifically in the tof ( arrival - time ) distribution using atomic bec .",
    "this experimentally testable scheme has the potential to empirically resolve ambiguities inherent in the theoretical formulations of the quantum arrival time distribution .",
    "here we use the probability current density approach to calculate the quantum tof distributions for atomic bec schrdinger cat represented by superposition of macroscopically separated wave packets in space .",
    "our definition of the quantum tof distribution in terms of the modulus of the probability current density is particularly motivated from the equation of continuity , and other physical considerations discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "this approach also provides a proper classical limit , as the interference and hence the coherence in the quantum tof signal disappears in the large - mass limit .",
    "we repeat that there is no classical analogue of this tof distribution @xmath81 and this is purely a quantum distribution where we see the matter - wave interference in the quantum tof signal .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to see if our prediction of interference in time domain ( tof distribution ) can be verified in actual experiments using modern interferometry techniques and sophisticated tof methods",
