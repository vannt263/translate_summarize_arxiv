    "therefore it becomes mandatory to obtain results from the wilson - polchinski rg with a higher precision , in order to confirm or refute the above - mentioned discrepancy .    in this paper , we close this gap in the literature and study both the wilson - polchinski rg and the optimised rg for the 3d ising universality class with an unprecedented accuracy . to that end",

    "given the high degree of accuracy in the critical indices from the present and earlier studies , and the fact that the scaling exponents in all three approaches have been obtained from several independent numerical implementations and collaborations , it is unlikely that the discrepancy originates from numerical insufficiencies .",
    "furthermore , these differences are absent in the limit of continuous block - spin transformations @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the tacit assumption of @xmath150-independence in the scaling exponents of the hierarchical model @xcite can not be maintained .",
    "rather , the hierarchical model carries an inherent @xmath150-dependence , similar to a dependence previously observed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in functional rg approaches , scheme - dependences related to the underlying wilsonian momentum cutoff can arise in truncations @xcite . here ,",
    "powerful control and optimisation mechanisms are available which decrease truncational artefacts and increase convergence towards the physical theory @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see if the @xmath150-dependence of hierarchical models or its extensions can be understood along similar lines .    for our numerical work",
    ", we have developed methods to solve non - linear eigenvalue problems with high precision .",
    "the combined use of local polynomial expansions techniques with global integration methods allows for an efficient determination of the full fixed point solutions with reasonable numerical efforts .",
    "we have also put some emphasis on a reliable error control , in view of the high accuracy aimed for in the universal eigenvalues .",
    "we expect that this combination of techniques will be equally useful for other non - linear problems in mathematical physics , including @xmath88  the derivative expansion to higher order .",
