    "the studies on exotic magnetism in geometrically frustrated systems is a hot topic in condensed matter physics , powered by the discovery of many new candidate materials and the development of new theoretical techniques .",
    "@xcite a key feature of frustrated magnets is the suppression of conventional magnetic ordering . in these systems ,",
    "competition between magnetic interactions due to underlying lattice geometry suppresses the formation of magnetic long - range order ( lro ) , often leaving the system disordered down to zero temperature . in classical spin systems ,",
    "the disordered ground state is associated with macroscopic degeneracy comprised of spin states that satisfy a local constraint .",
    "@xcite such degenerated ground states are extremely sensitive to perturbations , such as subdominant interactions and fluctuations , providing a fertile ground for exotic magnetism .",

    "the arrows in ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) indicate ordered ising moments , and the filled circles in ( a ) indicate paramagnetic sites . in ( a ) , the shaded hexagon shows the crystallographic unit cell of the kagome lattice ( 1 , 2 , and 3 denote the three sublattices ) , and the dotted hexagon is the magnetic unit cell for the pd state ( a , b , and c indicates magnetic sublattices ) ; @xmath1 is the lattice constant . in ( b)-(d ) , the thick lines connect sites with up spins ; in ( b ) , the dots denote the sites with down spins and the 6 site loops are colored in red . ]    a fundamental , interesting example is found in ising antiferromagnets on geometrically frustrated lattices .",
    "for example , previous studies on the triangular  @xcite and kagome lattice  @xcite ising antiferromagnets have reported that kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phases are induced by further - neighbor interactions .",
    "another prominent phenomenon caused by subdominant interactions is the partial lifting of the ground - state manifold , such as partially disordered ( pd ) states .",
    "@xcite the pd states are peculiar magnetic orders characterized by coexistence of magnetically - ordered and paramagnetic ( pm ) sites forming a periodic structure ; an example on the kagome lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome](a ) . due to the presence of the pm moments ,",
    "the pd states retain the residual entropy .",
    "hence , they are interpreted as a partial lifting of the degenerate ground - state manifold .",
    "another interesting example is in itinerant magnets on frustrated lattices .",
    "@xcite some of them are described by the kondo lattice model , in which itinerant electrons are coupled with localized moments via the local exchange interaction . in this system ,",
    "the effective interactions between the localized moments are induced by the kinetic motion of itinerant electrons , known as the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "@xcite such effective interactions are , in general , long - ranged with oscillating sign , potentially leading to competing interactions .",
    "meanwhile , in the itinerant electron systems , magnetic lro may be stabilized by the formation of energy gap in the electronic band structure . in the itinerant magnets ,",
    "these effects may give rise to frustration and exotic magnetic states .",
    "indeed , recent numerical studies on a triangular lattice model have reported a rich phase diagram . in the case of the model with ising localized moments , pd and kt - like states",
    "were obtained along with several magnetically lro states .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a peculiar noncoplanar lro with scalar chirality ordering was reported in the case of heisenberg - type localized moments .",
    "@xcite we also note that a recent experiment on ag@xmath2cro@xmath2 reported possibility of a pd state .",
    "@xcite    in addition , it is also interesting to see how the exotic magnetism affects itinerant electrons .",
    "for instance , local correlations in the onsite potentials are known to induce delocalization of electrons , e.g. , by a dimer correlation in one dimension  @xcite and by formation of loops  @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "also , charge - gap formation by local correlations was reported in a kagome lattice model .",
    "@xcite thus , frustrated itinerant magnets are candidates for exploring novel phenomena induced by the cooperation of spin - charge coupling and geometrical frustration .",
    "recently , the authors have reported that the kondo lattice model with ising localized moments on a kagome lattice shows peculiar magnetic states , such as pd  @xcite and loop - liquid ( ll )  @xcite phases .",
    "however , detailed investigation on the magnetic phase diagrams and their electronic properties have not been reported yet . in this paper",
    ", we show comprehensive numerical results on both the magnetic and electronic properties . by using a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ,",
    "we show that the model exhibits rich phase diagram with various thermally - induced magnetic phases : kt - like , partially - ferromagnetic ( pfm ) , pd , and ll states , along with conventional magnetic orders such as ferromagnetic ( fm ) and @xmath3 and @xmath0 ferrimagnetic ( fr ) orders .",
    "we also show peculiar electronic and transport properties of the pd and ll states , reflecting the magnetic textures of the underlying localized spins .",
    "these results imply that the transport measurements can be used as experimental probes to detect the exotic magnetic states .",

    "the sum @xmath10 is taken over nn sites on the kagome lattice .",
    "the second term is the onsite interaction between localized spins and itinerant electrons , where @xmath11 corresponds to the @xmath12-component of itinerant electron spin , and @xmath13 is the localized ising moment at @xmath8th site ; @xmath14 is the coupling constant ( the sign of @xmath14 does not matter in the present model ) .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath15 as the unit of energy , and the lattice constant @xmath16 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome](a ) ] .      to investigate thermodynamic properties of the model  ( [ eq : h ] ) , we utilized a mc simulation which has been widely applied to similar models .",
    "@xcite although there have already been numbers of papers which describe this method , here we briefly review the mc technique to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the model we study in this paper , eq .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) is that the hamiltonian is block diagonal for different spin configurations @xmath24 , i.e. , the two traces in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) are taken separately .",
    "hence , one can calculate the partition function by estimating the trace @xmath18 by a classical mc sampling over @xmath24 using the markov - chain mc method .",

    "for the mc sampling , we utilized single - spin flip update with the standard metropolis algorithm . on the other hand , to overcome the freezing of mc sampling in the ll state , we also implemented the loop - update method  @xcite in our calculations .",
    "also , some of the low - temperature data were calculated starting from a mixed initial spin configuration of low - temperature ordered and high - temperature disordered states .",
    "@xcite    the calculations were conducted up to the system size @xmath30 with @xmath31 under the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thermal averages of physical quantities were calculated for typically 15000 - 80000 mc steps after 5000 - 18000 steps for thermalization .",
    "the results are shown in the temperature range where the acceptance ratio is larger than @xmath321% .",
    "we divided the mc measurements into five bins and estimated the statistical errors by the standard deviations among the bins .      in this section",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "the electronic properties , such as the density of states ( dos ) and the optical conductivity , are computed for the itinerant electrons . on the other hand , for the magnetic properties , we focus on the contribution from the localized moments , which is simple to compute in the mc simulation , and ignore that from the itinerant electrons .",
    "this is justified when the magnitude of the localized spins is much larger than @xmath33 , such as in some of rare - earth magnets .",

    "although we could not detect such a phase transition within the current mc simulation , it is unlikely that the pd state remains as the ground state since it retains finite residual entropy due to the paramagnetic moments .",
    "it is more likely that , in the lowest temperature , the degeneracy will be lifted by the long - range rkky interactions induced by the spin - charge coupling ,  @xcite driving a transition to an lro state .",
    "if this is the case , the transition temperature is much lower than we could approach in the current mc simulation , indicating the energy scale of the relevant rkky interaction is extremely small .",
    "we note that a similar feature was also reported recently in an ising spin kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice , where the pd state survived down to an extremely low temperature at @xmath149 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , another possibility is that the pd state is taken over by a phase separation at the lowest temperature .      in the previous studies on the pd state in the triangular lattice case ,",
    "@xcite it was shown that the energy gap opens in the dos with the formation of pd .",

    "it was also argued that the energy gap formation may play a role in stabilizing the pd state . to see whether such behavior also takes place in the current kagome case , we calculated the electronic dos using the mc calculation",

    "in contrast , the data at @xmath153 shows a clear energy gap at the fermi level , indicating that the pd state is an insulator .",
    "this behavior resembles that of the pd state in the triangular lattice model .",
    "hence , it is likely that the energy - gap formation contributes to the stabilization of the pd state also in the current kagome lattice case .",
    "one difference from the triangular lattice case is that the kt - like state appears above the pd state . in the present calculation",
    ", the dos at the fermi level appears to decrease below @xmath154 .",
    "as the kt - like state is an intermediate state with quasi - lro , it is natural that the gap opens at @xmath155 where the true lro sets in .",
    "nevertheless , in our calculation , a precursor of the gap formation is observed in the kt - like phase . because of the finite size effect , however , it is not clear at which temperature a full gap opens in the mc data .",
    "another notable feature of the dos is the spikes at @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "these spikes are likely to originate in the peculiar magnetic texture of the pd state . in the pd state ,",

    "<S> magnetic and electronic states of an ising - spin kondo lattice model on a kagome lattice are investigated by a monte carlo simulation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the conventional ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic orders , we show that this model exhibits several thermally - induced phases , such as partially disordered , kosterlitz - thouless - like , and loop - liquid states . in the partially disordered state , we show that the magnetic transition is associated with the charge - gap formation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the density of state shows characteristic peaks reflecting the underlying spin texture . on the other hand , in the loop - liquid state </S>",
    "<S> , the formation of closed loops of the same spin sites manifests itself in the peaks in the density of states and the optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> our results elucidate the peculiar cooperation between thermal fluctuations and the spin - charge interplay in this frustrated itinerant electron system . </S>"
