    "the very coolest stars and the warmer brown dwarfs require a new spectral class , known as ` l ' @xcite .",
    "the l dwarf sequence is characterized by the disappearance of the red tio and vo bands from the optical ( 0.6@xmath21.0 @xmath0 m ) spectrum , the increasing dominance at those wavelengths by broad absorption resonance lines of na i and k i , and strong h@xmath3o absorption bands and persistent co overtone bands in the 1@xmath22.5 @xmath0 m region @xcite . in terms of broadband colors ,",
    "l dwarfs are characterized by very red infrared colors ( e.g. @xmath4 ) .",
    "even cooler brown dwarfs require the additional class , ` t ' @xcite . in t dwarfs ,",
    "the co bands are replaced by stronger and more extensive absorptions of ch@xmath5 in the h and k bands , and there is further strengthening of water bands @xcite .",
    "t dwarfs are characterized by blue infrared colors ( e.g. @xmath6 ) .",
    "spectral classification of l and t dwarfs including l / t transition objects has been made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "l dwarfs are now classified from l0 to l9 and t dwarfs from t0 to t8 .",
    "the classification scheme is purely observational and uses indices in the 1@xmath22.5 @xmath0 m region related to h@xmath3o , co , ch@xmath5 and near - infrared colors .",
    "we reexamine the spectral classification using the spectra obtained at subaru .",
    "we pay special attention to the behavior of feh and the features related to h@xmath3o and ch@xmath5 .",
    "once the classification scheme is established , the next step is to find the correspondence between effective temperatures and spectral type and elucidate the physical meaning of the spectral classification .",
    "some authors have derived relations between the effective temperatures and spectral type for l dwarfs @xcite and for l and t dwarfs @xcite , but there has not been a work in which the relation was obtained from effective temperatures based on bolometric correction derived from photospheric models which are applicable throughout the l - t sequence .",
    "some of the objects in our sample have known parallaxes .",
    "we obtain bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures for these objects by integrating the observed spectra between 0.87 and 2.5 @xmath0 m and by the @xmath1-band bolometric correction using the unified cloudy models ( ucm ) @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the two methods implies that the @xmath1-band bolometric correction leads to reasonable effective temperatures except for early l type .",
    "encouraged by this analysis , we apply the @xmath1-band bolometric correction to the objects whose parallaxes are known from the literature @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , observations , data reduction and the sample for the analysis are described .",
    "spectral classification is discussed and identification of spectral features is reexamined in  3 .",
    "we confirm the validity of the @xmath1-band bolometric correction derived by ucms with the integrated fluxes as noted above .",
    "we then obtain bolometric luminosities of the objects with known parallaxes and the relation between the effective temperature and spectral type in  4 .",
    "the summary of the paper is given in  5 .",
    "observations were made on 2002 , june 3 ut at the subaru telescope using imaging and grism modes of cisco @xcite .",
    "we obtained spectra of six objects ( table 2 ) , for four of which @xmath7 photometry was also obtained ( table 1 ) .",
    "the six objects were selected to sample the l - t sequence widely from the objects in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sky was clear and the seeing was less than @xmath8 at 2 @xmath0 m throughout the night .",
    "cisco employs the mko - nir filters @xcite .",
    "photometric observations were made when the objects were near transit , and the airmasses were less than 1.2 . for photometric calibration , ukirt faint standards @xcite were used .    in the case of spectroscopy ,",
    "the slit width of @xmath8 was sampled at @xmath9 pixel@xmath10 and the resolutions of @xmath11 ( 0.882 - 1.400 @xmath0 m ) , @xmath12 ( 1.056 - 1.816 @xmath0 m ) and wide-@xmath1 ( 1.850 - 2.512 @xmath0 m ) grisms were 550 , 400 and 600 respectively .",
    "the targets were nodded along the slit , and observations taken in abba sequence , where a and b stand for the first and second positions on the slit .",
    "integration time is summarized in table 2 .",
    "sdss2249 + 00 was observed at the end of the night and only a @xmath12 spectrum was obtained for it .",
    "spectra of a nearby f / g star were obtained before or after the observations of each object .      for photometric data reduction",
    ", aperture photometry was made using the apphot package in iraf .",
    "photon statistics gave uncertainties much less than 0.05 mag .",
    "however , we estimated that airmass differences between the targets and standards and the difference between the ukirt and mko - nir systems introduced uncertainties of about 0.05 mag .",
    "spectral data were reduced using iraf .",
    "the effect of the terrestrial atmosphere was removed by dividing by the spectra of nearby f / g stars after removing hydrogen recombination lines seen in their spectra .",
    "spectral segments were individually flux calibrated using the photometric data given in table 1 .",
    "each segment and spectral data of vega @xcite were integrated over the appropriate filter profile .",
    "vega was assumed to be zero magnitude at all wavelengths , and the target flux was scaled to match the broadband photometry .",
    "in addition to the six objects for which spectra were obtained in june 2002 , we added three objects whose spectra were obtained previously by ircs @xcite on subaru , 2mass1146 + 22 , 2mass0920 + 35 , and 2mass1507@xmath216 from a previously published paper @xcite and gl229b from the literature @xcite .",
    "there are in total ten objects as listed in table 3 .",
    "the sample ranges in spectral type from l3 to t8 . for six of the ten objects",
    "trigonometric parallaxes are known from the literature ( burgasser 2001 ; dahn et al .",
    "2002 ; tinney et al . 2003 ; references therein ) : they are 2mass1146 + 22 , 2mass1507@xmath216 , 2mass1523 + 30 , sdss1254@xmath201 , gl229b , and 2mass1217@xmath203 .",
    "2mass1146 + 22 is a close binary @xcite whose spectral type is l3 @xcite .",
    "the observed magnitude difference is small at @xmath13 ( 0.3 mag ) and reid et al .",
    "estimate that the difference in bolometric magnitude is 0.15 .",
    "2mass0920 + 35 is also a close binary whose spectral type is l6.5 @xcite .",
    "weak methane absorption features are seen at @xmath14 and @xmath1 bands @xcite .",
    "the magnitude difference at @xmath13 is 0.44 and reid et al .",
    "estimate that the difference in bolometric magnitude is 0.15 .",
    "the parallax of this object is not known and we use this object only for the discussion of its spectrum .",
    "we examine our spectra which cover a representative sample of l and t types in some detail .",
    "it turns out that some of the prominent spectral features remain unidentified and the interpretation of the identified features is by no means clear yet . in this section , we apply the predicted spectral line intensities based on the ucms discussed in a separate paper @xcite as a guide to interpret the observed spectra .      the spectra of eight objects in the @xmath1-band region are shown on the @xmath15 scale in fig.1 .",
    "the prominent features are co first overtone bands at 2.3 @xmath0 m in l dwarfs and can be traced up to t2 or t3.5 dwarfs in our sample .",
    "the methane bands at 2.2 @xmath0 m are quite strong in t dwarfs , and a question is if they are already seen in late l dwarfs . a very weak bandhead feature may be seen at 2.2 @xmath0 m in the l6.5 dwarf 2mass0920 + 35 as already noted previously @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of another l6.5 dwarf 2mass1711 + 22 is a bit noisy and it is difficult to identify the methane 2.2 @xmath0 m bands . in l8 dwarf 2mass1523 + 30 ,",
    "the presence of the methane 2.2 @xmath0 m bands was previously suggested by @xcite",
    ". the s / n ratio of our spectrum of 2mass1523 + 30 may be somewhat better than that of mclean et al . and",
    "the methane 2.2 @xmath0 m bands can be clearly seen in fig.1 .",
    "thus , the methane 2.2 @xmath0 m bands can be deemed as detected at l8 .",
    "this better s / n ratio is probably due to the lower spectral resolution and higher throughput of cisco on subaru than nirspec on keck .      in the @xmath14-band region ,",
    "absorption features are clearly seen at 1.58 , 1.59 , 1.61 , and 1.625 @xmath0 m in l3 and l5 dwarfs as shown by the filled triangles in fig .",
    "2 . of these features , those at 1.58 , 1.613 , and 1.627 @xmath0 m were noted in l dwarfs by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the features at 1.583 , 1.591 , and 1.625 @xmath0 m were identified as due to the feh @xmath16 system in the spectra of sunspot as well as of m - l dwarfs by @xcite , who also remarked that the feature at 1.611 @xmath0 m had a confused appearance .",
    "more recently , the analysis of the feh bands in m and l dwarfs has been extended by @xcite , who showed that the 1.625 @xmath0 m feature is the strongest among the four features prominent in the @xmath14-band region .",
    "thus all the four features ( 1.583 , 1.591 , 1.611 , and 1.625 @xmath0 m ) in our spectra of l3 - l5 dwarfs can be identified with feh .",
    "a question is if the same identification can be applied to the l6.5 and l8 dwarfs in our sample .",
    "another possibility is that the 1.63 as well as 1.67 @xmath0 m feature in the l6.5 and l8 dwarfs is due to methane bands .",
    "we have already attributed these features as due to methane in the l6.5 dwarf 2mass0920 + 35 @xcite , but the possible presence of the feh bands was not known at that time .",
    "the 1.63 @xmath0 m feature can also be seen in all the l dwarfs while the 1.67 @xmath0 m feature is not clear in the l3 - l5 dwarfs and appears first in l6.5 .",
    "also , the 1.583 and 1.591 @xmath0 m features are rather weak in the l6.5 dwarfs .",
    "these observations may support the appearance of methane at l6.5 , and it is at least possible that feh and ch@xmath5 both contribute to the 1.63 and 1.67 @xmath0 m features in l6.5 dwarfs . to settle this problem ,",
    "higher resolution works are needed . as for 2mass1523 + 30 ,",
    "absence of the 1.61 @xmath0 m feature suggests that the 1.63 @xmath0 m feature may be due to ch@xmath5 rather than feh .",
    "the methane features at 1.63 and 1.67 @xmath0 m are clearly seen in the t2 dwarf and strengthen rapidly toward the later t dwarfs .",
    "where methane bands appear is a critical issue in the spectral classification of brown dwarfs , since methane is a sensitive indicator of temperature .",
    "although the methane bands depend on gravity as well as on temperature , the increased abundance of methane at the higher gravity is compensated for to some extent by the increased h@xmath3 cia which also increases with gravity @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the @xmath14-band region is by no means a good continuum window , but is contaminated by molecular bands of unknown origin in addition to feh especially in l dwarfs . also , we notice a large difference in the spectra of the same spectral type , namely between the l dwarfs 2mass1507@xmath216 and sdss2249 + 00 : the @xmath14 band spectrum of 2mass1507@xmath216 is rather flat as are those of the other l dwarfs while that of sdss2249 + 00 shows a prominent peaking centered at about 1.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "the reason for this difference is unknown at present .      in fig.3",
    ", we show the region between @xmath17 and @xmath14 bands .",
    "it is to be noted that water bands at 1.4 @xmath0 m can be well measured in the five spectra observed by cisco despite the water bands in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "unfortunately , only the edge of the 1.4 @xmath0 m bands , arising in hotter environments of these cool dwarfs than the earth s atmosphere , can be measured in the three objects observed by ircs .",
    "one interesting result is that the h@xmath3o 1.4 @xmath0 m band does not appear stronger in the l8 dwarf 2mass1523 + 30 than in the l6.5 dwarfs 2mass1711 + 22 and 2mass0920 + 35 m is nearly comparable between 2m1711 and 2m1523 but the overall depression between 1.31 and 1.60@xmath0 m may be slightly larger in 2m1711 than in 2m1523 . ] .",
    "further , in the 1.1 @xmath0 m bands of water , the absorption is clearly weaker in the l8 dwarf 2m1523 than in l6.5 dwarf 2m1711 as can been seen in fig.4 .",
    "the spectral types are based on @xcite and those by @xcite also show the similar types .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , since the 1.1 and 1.4 @xmath0 m water bands were used as classification criteria by @xcite .",
    "the water band strengths , however , do not necessarily increase linearly with the l types , and some water bands show little change in their strengths between l3 and l8 @xcite .",
    "although there appears a plateau in the @xmath18 scale between l6 and l8 (  4.2 ) , we think that the spectral types basically correspond to a temperature sequence , since the present spectral types are determined by the several temperature sensitive spectral features in the optical region on purely empirical basis @xcite and are consistent mostly with the infrared spectral indices including methane bands @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that water bands are weaker in the cooler l dwarfs than in the warmer objects , while the methane feature at 2.2 @xmath0 m is stronger in the l8 dwarf than in the l6.5 dwarfs as shown in fig .",
    "1 . we interpret this result as follows .",
    "the water abundance should be larger in cooler objects , but extinction by dust clouds , still located in the optically thin region in l dwarfs , should be larger in cooler objects as well . then the increasing water abundance and",
    "the increasing dust extinction may cancel out in l dwarfs .",
    "for this reason , water band strengths do not show a large increase in l dwarfs @xcite , and it is no wonder that they show an inversion somewhere in l types .",
    "the methane feature at 2.2 @xmath0 m does not necessarily suffer the same effect , either because the dust extinction is already not so important in the 2.2 @xmath0 m region than the 1.4 @xmath0 m region , as also can be seen in the cloud models by @xcite , or else because of the more rapid increase of the methane band strength with the decreasing effective temperature than in the case of the water bands .",
    "we have confirmed these results by a detailed computation of the spectral line intensities based on the ucms by considering the effect not only of @xmath18 and log@xmath19 but also of the change of the background opacities due to atoms , ions , dust grains , and quasi - continuous sources such as h@xmath3 cia @xcite .",
    "the spectra between 0.95 and 1.3 @xmath0 m are shown in fig.4 .",
    "first , we confirm that feh @xmath20 0.99 @xmath0 m bands can be clearly seen not only in l dwarfs but also in t dwarfs as noted by @xcite .",
    "the 0.99 @xmath0 m feh bands gradually weaken from l6.5 to l8 and further to t2 , but strengthen again at t3.5 .",
    "the weakening of the 0.99 @xmath0 m feh bands from l6.5 to l8 is consistent with the weakening of the 1.61 and 1.63 @xmath0 m features in the same objects , and this lends a support for the contribution of feh to these features .",
    "however , the observed strengths of feh 0.99 @xmath0 m bands , not only of t dwarfs but also of l dwarfs , are difficult to interpret directly by our ucms as well as by other models now available . in this connection",
    ", @xcite suggested that the dust cloud breaks in the early t dwarfs and feh formed deep in the photosphere can be peered through the holes of the cloud .",
    "the idea of cloud clearing model was motivated by the difficulty of the cloudy models by @xcite to explain the observed color - magnitude diagram , but we have shown that the color - magnitude diagram can be accounted for by our ucm without introducing such a hypothesis as break - up of the cloud @xcite .",
    "as an alternative interpretation , we would like to call attention to the possible formation of the second convective zone near the surface of the late l and early t dwarfs .",
    "this second convective zone is predicted by the ucms of @xmath21 k and is formed by the steep temperature gradient due to the large opacity of the dust cloud itself @xcite .",
    "the lower boundary of this convective zone is facing the region free of dust but feh can be abundant there . then these feh molecules will be dredged up by the convection to the upper cooler region and some feh molecules will remain super - saturated until they are eventually transformed to the condensates .",
    "in fact , the second convective zone is rather thin and some feh molecules will survive at the upper boundary of the convective zone .",
    "these feh molecules will constantly be replenished by the convection and can be observed so long as the second convective zone reaches the region to give observable effect .",
    "such a possibility of vertical transport of feh was also noted by @xcite who , however , remarked that the fragility of the feh bond ( dissociation energy of only 1.67ev ) will preclude such a possibility , even if such a vertical mixing may account for the unexpectedly strong co fundamental bands observed in the t dwarf gl 229b @xcite .",
    "certainly , more detailed quantitative analysis will required before we reach a definite conclusion .",
    "the other prominent features are k i doublets at 1.1690/1.1773 and at 1.2432/1.2522 @xmath0 m . the k",
    "i lines are rather strong in the early and middle l dwarfs , but weaken in the late l dwarfs . after passing the minimum at l8 ,",
    "they are again reinforced in the early and middle t dwarfs until masked by the strong 1.1 @xmath0 m water bands in the late t dwarfs .",
    "these results are quite consistent with those reported by @xcite .",
    "the diminishing k i lines towards later l dwarfs can be interpreted as due to the effect of extinction by dust which is located in the optically thin photosphere in l dwarfs and shows the maximum at late l dwarfs . for this reason ,",
    "k i lines show the minimum at late l as the water bands at 1.1 and 1.4 @xmath0 m .",
    "after the cloud is buried below the observable photosphere , k i lines strengthen again despite the unfavorable excitation at lower temperatures until being masked by rapidly strengthened water bands .",
    "the feature near 1.14 @xmath0 m is identified as due to na i doublet 1.1404/1.138 @xmath0 m with log@xmath22 = @xmath20.186/@xmath20.487 @xcite .",
    "however , the observed feature near 1.14 @xmath0 m shows asymmetry with the stronger absorption at the short wavelength side , contradicting the expectation from the gf - values .",
    "thus , there should be some other contributions such as of h@xmath3o and ch@xmath5 to the 1.14 @xmath0 m feature which , however , shows the similar pattern as the k i lines .",
    "the 1.1 @xmath0 m bands of water can not be seen in the l5 dwarf , sdss2249 + 00 , and this is unusually weak for l5 , compared with the published results for other l5 dwarfs ( e.g. geballe et al .",
    "2002 , reid et al .",
    "also k i lines just discussed above are also unusually weak for l5 in sdss2249 + 00 . also remembering the unique spectrum around 1.7 @xmath0 m",
    "as noted in  3.2 , this object may be peculiar for an l5 dwarf .",
    "the 1.1 @xmath0 m bands of water are stronger in the l6.5 dwarf , 2mass1711 + 22 than in the l8 dwarf , 2mass1523 + 30 as already noted .",
    "since the observed infrared spectrum covers the major part of the total flux , it can be a useful measure of the bolometric luminosity if combined with a parallax measurement .",
    "since the number of the objects with known parallaxes is modest in our sample , we also apply @xmath1-band bolometric correction ( bc@xmath23 ) to the photometric data of the objects with known parallaxes in the literature .",
    "we then estimate effective temperatures based on the bolometric luminosities and the radius which can be nearly constant at the jupiter radius .",
    "a direct measurement of the bolometric flux is difficult for brown dwarfs at present .",
    "however , a large part of the luminosity is found in the near infrared region we have observed , namely between 0.87 and 2.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "this is predicted by the use of seds based on ucms @xcite and the fraction of the integrated flux between 0.87 and 2.5 @xmath0 m over the total flux is shown in fig.5a . in fig.5a ,",
    "three curves are given for @xmath24 = 4.5 , 5.0 , and 5.5 ( @xmath25 = 1800 k ) .",
    "since they are not very different , we use the one for @xmath24 = 5.0 .",
    "it turns out that the near infrared flux is about 50% of the total flux at @xmath26 k , but nearly 70% at @xmath27 k. the inversion around @xmath28 k is due to the dust extinction which is the largest around that temperature .",
    "we integrate our observed spectra of the objects with known parallaxes , which are flux calibrated as noted in  2 and then the bolometric fluxes are estimated by applying the ratio of the integrated infrared flux to the bolometric flux by the use of the model prediction shown in fig.5a .",
    "to obtain @xmath18 , we assume the range of the brown dwarf radius @xmath29 to be from @xmath30 ( relatively young object ) to @xmath31 ( very old object ) @xcite .",
    "2mass1146 + 22ab is assumed to be an equal binary composed of two l3 dwarfs , since the magnitude difference at @xmath13 is small @xcite .",
    "the resultant bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures are given in table 4 .",
    "an alternative approach to obtain bolometric luminosities is to apply bolometric correction to the absolute magnitudes .",
    "the bolometric correction bc@xmath23 for @xmath1-magnitude is given by    @xmath32    and this bc@xmath23 has been evaluated by the use of ucms in the cit photometric system . the bolometric correction given as a function of @xmath18 is shown in fig.5b , where three curves for @xmath24 = 4.5 , 5.0 , and 5.5 are drawn .",
    "again the gravity dependence is weak and we use the curve for @xmath24 = 5.0 . in order to estimate @xmath18 of an object",
    "whose @xmath33 is given , the following iterative procedure is required .",
    "first , a tentative @xmath18 is assumed and corresponding bc@xmath23 is evaluated from fig .",
    "5b . from bc@xmath23 , @xmath34 is derived and , by assuming the radius of the object , @xmath18 is obtained .",
    "the initial and resultant @xmath18s are compared .",
    "if they agree to each other , the procedure is stopped .",
    "if they do not , the resultant @xmath18 is used as the initial value and the procedure is repeated .",
    "normally @xmath18 converges after a few iterations .",
    "again we assume the range of the radius to be from @xmath30 to 0.85 @xmath35 .",
    "the bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures obtained this way are given in table 4 .    in table 4 , @xmath36(integrated flux ) and @xmath36(bc@xmath23 ) show reasonable agreement except for 2mass1146 + 22a for which the difference is by a factor of 2.9 . as we find later , effective temperature estimates for early l dwarfs obtained by the @xmath1-band bolometric correction using ucms tend to be higher than the estimates by other methods .",
    "the agreement of the two methods for objects with spectral types l5 and later is encouraging in that the @xmath1-band bolometric correction may be applied to all objects with known parallaxes to derive the relation between the effective temperature and spectral type for a larger sample .",
    "parallaxes and photometry of l and t dwarfs have been obtained , compiled and published in the literature ( burgasser 2001 , dahn et al .",

    "some authors have derived relations between @xmath18 and spectral type for l dwarfs @xcite and for l and t dwarfs @xcite , but there has not been a work in which the relation was obtained based on bolometric correction derived from photospheric models which are applicable throughout the l - t sequence . in this subsection",

    "we adopt the estimate of the @xmath1 magnitude and spectral type of the primary component by tinney et al . , but we do not include the secondary component . since the spectral type of the secondary component was not determined by spectroscopy , but by the magnitude difference , it is not logical to use it to derive the relation between @xmath18 and spectral type .",

    "we briefly examine the cloud clearing model .",
    "first , one underlying assumption is that the model by @xcite is correct as a cloudy model , about which we have some doubt .",
    "ucms @xcite reproduced the basic features of the color - magnitude diagram of l and t dwarfs although the basic assumptions on the clouds are simpler .",
    "second , the cloud clearing model has not passed the test of comparing the spectra of l / t transition objects with model spectra .",
    "third , @xcite observed variabilities of l and t dwarfs and did not find significant correlations between variability amplitude and spectral type or @xmath60 color .",
    "this result does not support the cloud clearing model positively .",
    "@xcite claim that the plateau of the effective temperature near the l / t transition , which we also see in fig .",
    "6 is naturally explained by the cloud clearing model , but there is a 100k difference in the transition temperature .",
    "in summary , ucm estimates of l dwarf temperatures are consistent with others except for early l for which the ucms give somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "the estimate of the l / t transition temperature , 1300k , is in agreement with that by @xcite , but somewhat higher than that by @xcite .",
    "we have obtained near - infrared spectra of l dwarfs , l / t transition objects and t dwarfs using subaru .",
    "the resulting spectra are examined in detail to see their dependence on the spectral types . as for methane",
    ", we have found that it appears at l8 and marginally at l6.5 .",
    "the water bands at 1.1 and 1.4 @xmath0 m do not necessarily show steady increase towards later l types but may show inversion at late l types .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the spectral types do not represent a temperature sequence , but can be interpreted as due to compensation of the increasing water abundance by the dust extinction in the later l types .",
    "we confirm that the feh 0.99 @xmath0 m bands appear not only in late l dwarfs but also in the early t dwarfs as was first noted by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that feh could be dredged up by the surface convective zone induced by the steep temperature gradient due to the large opacity of the dust cloud itself and will be replenished constantly by the convection .",
    "we have obtained bolometric luminosities of the objects with known parallaxes in our sample by integrating the spectra between 0.87 and 2.5 @xmath0 m and by the @xmath1-band bolometric correction .",
    "apart from the l3 dwarf , 2mass1146 + 22a , the bolometric luminosities obtained by both methods agree well and this implies that the @xmath1-band bolometric correction obtained by ucms can be used to obtain the bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures of the l and t dwarfs with known parallaxes from the literature .",
    "the relation between the effective temperature and spectral type derived from the @xmath1-band bolometric correction shows monotonic behavior throughout the l - t sequence .",
    "there is another method to estimate the effective temperature of a brown dwarf , which is to compare the observed spectrum and model spectra .",
