    "in contrast , dft has known difficulties in predicting quantities associated with excited states , which is not surprising since it was first proposed as a ground - state theory . as an example , the electronic band structure provided by dft consistently shows an underestimated gap between valence and conduction bands @xcite . as consequence ,",
    "the electronic band structure provided by dft gives poor predictions for the onset of photoemission and inverse photoemission @xcite .",

    "the linear optical spectrum can also be obtained , providing reliable results for the optical gap and excitonic effects @xcite . since knowledge of the electron self - energy is required in solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , this method is often refered to as gw+bse @xcite .",
    "although powerful , the gw+bse method is very complex when applied to non - periodic systems , especially when discrete fourier analysis is not applicable and approximations such as the generalized plasmon pole model @xcite do not lead to substantial simplification . some materials that fall in this category are confined systems : quantum dots , clusters , molecules , nanostructures . on the other hand , nanostructures are now the subject of intense work due to promising technological applications and recent advances in the preparation of artificial nanostructures @xcite . at the same time , significant effort has been dedicated on the theory side .",
    "some of the difficulties one may encounter by applying the gw approximation to large molecules were emphasized recently @xcite .",

    "similarly , the bethe - salpeter equation has been solved for a limited number of confined systems . during the last decade ,",
    "optical properties of confined systems have been investigated within time - dependent dft , often with very good results @xcite .",
    "time - dependent density dft in the local , adiabatic approximation ( tdlda ) is formally simpler than the gw+bse theory , but at the same time directed towards solving the same problem : predicting optical properties and neutral excitations in an electronic system .",

    "applications of the gw+bse method in nanostructures frequently impose artificial periodicity by placing the electronic system in a large supercell @xcite .",
    "this is a perfectly justifiable procedure , but it has the obvious deficiency of increasing the computational effort when supercells are required to be large . a more efficient procedure would be to take advantage of properties intrinsic to confined systems and design a numerical implementation of such green s function methods , and we now propose one such implementation . a key ingredient is electronic screening .",

    "the strength of this line depends on temperature and density of defects , and so the calculated strength is somewhat arbitrary .",

    "we believe this is related to the strong localization of both @xmath139 and @xmath140 orbitals . as discussed before ,",
    "these orbitals are confined to within 1 or 2 atom sites from the vacancy . to some extent",

    "we discussed an implementation of green s functions methods developed in the space of single - particle transitions .",
    "contrary to alternative approaches , this procedure does not make use of fourier analysis , and thus can be applied directly to confined systems , where it is particularly efficient . as an example , we are able to do a full gw+bse calculation of the benzene molecule using a 1.7 ghz ibm power4 machine in single - process mode in 280 minutes . this task requires no more than 600 mb of cpu memory and the only input required is the geometry of the molecule . taking advantage of the extreme numerical efficiency of the current implementation ,",
    "we are able to perform _ ab initio _ gw+bse calculations of silicon clusters containing more than one hundred atoms .    electronic screening is included within the tdlda , and a corresponding vertex is included for consistency in the diagrammatic expansion . the added terms ( tdlda vertex + tdlda screening ) are found to be essential for accurate predictions of electron affinity and ionization potentials of benzene and naphthalene .",
    "this is in contrast with previous gw calculations which assume screening at rpa level only but nevertheless provide accurate ionization potentials for small molecules @xcite .",
    "the explanation for this apparent contradiction may be that the popularly used plasmon - pole models carry information about the exact many - body screening and therefore corrects deficiencies of the rpa .    besides oligoacenes ,",
    "the current implementation is used to investigate the absorption cross section of silicon clusters by solving the bse .",
    "we conclude that , while the tdlda and bse differ markedly for small clusters , they agree in the broad features of the spectrum for large clusters . in particular , the dependence of excitation energy as function of cluster size is similar for both theories .",

    "the convergence rate can be accelerated by truncating this summation at some point and evaluating the remainder within the cohsex ( coulomb hole + screened exchange ) approximation @xcite .",

    "( [ e2.sigmac ] ) can then be replaced with              as an example , we have computed self - energy corrections in benzene including and not including the static remainder . with a static remainder , the first ionization energy decreases by 20  mev when @xmath155 increases from 256 to 512 , resulting in ionization potential of 9.30  ev for the larger value of @xmath155 . without static remainder , this ionization energy increases by 133  mev between the same choices of @xmath155 , and",
    "its value for @xmath159 is 8.27  ev , which is still far from convergence by as much as 1  ev .    in molecules and clusters ,",
    "high - energy virtual states are expected to be very delocalized , and therefore sensitive to the choice of boundary conditions . in spite of that",
    ", the use of confined - system boundary conditions ( where all wave - functions are required to vanish outside some spherical enclosure ) is still justified .",
    "the reason is that , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ e2.sigmac ] ) , only the overlap between high - energy and low - energy states is relevant for self - energy calculations .",
    "the detailed features of high - energy states in the vacuum region , away from the atoms , are not very important .",
    "in addition , the contribution of virtual states in the summations over @xmath81 decreases as one goes to higher and higher states . nevertheless , the size of the confining region should always be tested against convergence , so that the shape of virtual states in the vicinity of atoms is correctly described .",
