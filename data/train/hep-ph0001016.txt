    "<S> models based on soft colour exchanges to rearrange colour strings in the final state provide a general framework for both diffractive and non - diffractive events in @xmath0 and hadron - hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we study two such models and find that they can reproduce rapidity gap data from both hera and the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the influence of parton cascades and multiple interactions on the results .    </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity gap events observed at hera have traditionally been explained by regge - inspired models based on hard scattering of a parton in a pomeron , emitted from one of the protons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models work well in reproducing hera data , but in recent years rapidity gap events have also been observed at the tevatron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these data can not be reproduced using a pomeron model with parametrizations of the pomeron structure function from hera data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that the pomeron approach is not universal , e.g. that the pomeron flux factorization is not so simple . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that perturbative qcd can not fully describe the formation of rapidity gaps , since they involve the soft part of the event , with a long space - time scale .    </S>",
    "<S> a different approach has been developed @xcite , where the non - perturbative dynamics is modelled with soft colour exchanges , leading to variations in the topology of the confining colour field , e.g.  described by lund strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two models , which are similar in spirit but different in details : the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model @xcite and the generalized area law ( gal ) model @xcite . in the former , </S>",
    "<S> the partons emerging from the hard scattering are assumed to interact softly with the colour field of the proton , whereas in the latter , there are soft colour exchanges between overlapping strings . in both cases , the colour interactions lead to rearrangements of the colour charges and thereby the string topology . given the softness of these interactions , changes in momenta are neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> the rearrangements , or reconnections , of the strings may lead to phenomena such as rapidity gaps , leading protons or leading neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> another effect is that a @xmath1 pair may turn into a colour singlet and form a charmonium state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial colour order of the partons in the final state is given by the planar approximation in perturbative qcd , but this colour order may now be changed by the soft colour exchanges . in a , we show how this can give rise to diffractive @xmath2 production in @xmath3 collisions at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the upper diagram shows the standard qcd string configuration , with strings spanning the entire rapidity region . </S>",
    "<S> the lower diagram shows the situation after a reconnection of the strings , where there is a region in rapidity not covered by a string , such that a rapidity gap arises after hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> it is an important feature of the models that there is no sharp distinction between diffractive and non - diffractive events , but a smooth transition between the two types of events .    </S>",
    "<S> ccc    l +   +    & & + ( a ) & ( b ) & ( c )    [ fig : f2d3 ]    the two models have been implemented in the monte carlo event generators  @xcite for dis and  @xcite for @xmath4-collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to take an experimental approach and classify events as diffractive or non - diffractive depending on the characteristics of the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the models are introduced in the programs as a loop over all pairs of partons ( sci ) or strings ( gal ) and each pair is allowed to exchange colour with a certain probability given by the free parameter @xmath5 , which can not be calculated in perturbation theory . in the sci model , @xmath5 is taken as a constant and fitted to hera data @xcite . in the gal model , @xmath6 $ ] depends on the change @xmath7 that the string rearrangement introduces in the generalized ` area ' swept by the strings in energy - momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is a free parameter , simultaneously fitted to hera and lep data .    </S>",
    "<S> both the sci model and the gal model give good descriptions of diffractive hera data , e.g.  the diffractive structure function in b , but also of more detailed properties of the diffractive @xmath9-system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the description of inclusive final states is not as good for the sci model , which gives too many soft particles , whereas the gal model clearly improves this situation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the gal model suppresses strings associated with a large area ( ` long strings ' ) while the sci models allows reconnections giving long zig - zag - shaped strings .    </S>",
    "<S> diffraction in @xmath4 collisions at the tevatron offers a new testing ground for these models . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied both the sci and the gal models to @xmath4 collisions @xcite in order to investigate @xmath2 and di - jet production in association with a rapidity gap , and also central di - jet production with two rapidity gaps .    </S>",
    "<S> both models reproduce well the rates observed at the tevatron for production of diffractive @xmath2 and diffractive di - jets when the @xmath5-value obtained from hera data is used ( see c and table [ table ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the double gap fraction , i.e.  the fraction of events with two gaps , conventionally associated with double pomeron exchange , also comes out in decent agreement with data . </S>",
    "<S> this should be contrasted to the pomeron model , which , when tuned to hera data , overestimates the rates of diffractive di - jets by a factor 6 for single gap events and 275 for double gap events @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @lllllll observable & expt & @xmath10 & ref . </S>",
    "<S> & rate ( % ) & sci & gal +    @xmath2 - gap & cdf & 1800 & @xcite & @xmath11 & 1.2 & 0.8 + @xmath12 - gap & cdf & 1800 & @xcite & @xmath13 & 0.7 & 0.6 + @xmath12 - gap & d & 1800 & @xcite & @xmath14 & 0.8 & 0.7 + @xmath12 - gap & d & 630 & @xcite & @xmath15 & 0.9 & 1.2 + gap - @xmath12 -gap@xmath16&cdf&1800&@xcite & @xmath17&0.2&@xmath18 + gap - @xmath12 -gap@xmath16 & d&1800&@xcite&(not published ) & 0.2 & 0.1 +    @xmath16 ratio of 2-gap events to 1-gap events .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 we have not yet obtained a rate for the gal model .    in hadron - hadron collisions </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to consider the underlying event , since additional soft activity may spoil the rapidity gaps . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore used the model for multiple interactions @xcite present in , where the underlying event activity is described by additional parton - parton scatterings with a minimum transverse momentum @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sci model also contributes to the soft underlying event . to avoid ` double counting ' , we decrease the amount of multiple interactions by increasing the free parameter @xmath19 by about 500 mev to 2.5 gev , so that the net activity in the event will be the same . having no multiple interactions ( no mi in c ) gives a higher gap rate due to an unrealistically low event activity . because of the suppression of ` long ' strings , the gal model contributes less to the underlying event and @xmath20 gev can be used .  </S>",
    "<S> used with the sci / gal models results in essentially the same jet profiles , rapidity plateaux , and particle multiplicities as default .    </S>",
    "<S> another phenomenon that has been observed is central rapidity gaps between jets , so that there is a hard momentum transfer across the gap . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xcite that the gap rates obtained using the gal model as above are in agreement with the tevatron data , but there are uncertainties related to multiple interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the sci model does give such events too , but the rate is too low .    </S>",
    "<S> a potential problem is that the rate of gap events also depends on the amount of perturbative emissions . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the dglap evolution scheme does not give enough perturbative gluon emission in the forward region of small-@xmath21 dis events at hera @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may make sci and dglap in  overestimate the gap rate . using sci or similar models @xcite in  @xcite , which gives a better description of hard emissions in the forward region , gives a too low gap rate unless the cut - off parameter in the cascade is increased . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath5 parameter in sci and gal can be increased to give a larger gap rate in case of more perturbative emissions .    in this context </S>",
    "<S> , one should realize that these cascade models are not very well founded theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> dglap is derived in perturbative qcd for the inclusive case , whereas the cascade in  is given by a dipole approximation not based on feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> although one may expect that they give fair descriptions of the mean behaviour , there is no guarantee that they account for the fluctuations in the perturbative qcd emissions . </S>",
    "<S> downwards fluctuations in the number of gluons are important for rapidity gap formation . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore premature to draw too strong conclusions about this problem , which needs further investigations . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we have during this workshop started to implement the sci and gal models in the  monte carlo @xcite which uses a model for resolved photons to describe forward parton emissions .    in conclusion , the sci and gal models can give satisfactory descriptions of rapidity gap events in both @xmath0 and @xmath22 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> they also reproduce many features of non - gap events , such that a unified description of both diffractive and non - diffractive interactions are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> although these models are simple and leave some problems unsolved , they may represent a new way to improve our understanding of non - perturbative qcd dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank anders edin , leif lnnblad and johan rathsman for helpful discussions . </S>"
