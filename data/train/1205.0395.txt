    "the population of extragalactic radio sources is divided into several sub - classes each representing a different stage in the individual source life . in the evolutionary framework",
    ", the age of a radio source is directly related to its linear size ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this context , the empirical anticorrelation found by @xcite between the intrinsic linear sizes , @xmath3 , and the spectral peak frequency @xmath4 indicates an evolutionary path linking the different evolutionary stages : high frequency peakers ( hfp , @xmath5 5 ghz and @xmath3 @xmath6100 pc ) , will evolve into gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps , @xmath7 1 ghz and @xmath3@xmath81 kpc ) , and then into compact steep - spectrum ( css , @xmath7 100 mhz and @xmath915 kpc ) objects , which are the progenitors of the classical fanaroff - riley i / ii radio galaxies ( fri / frii , @xmath3 up to a few mpc , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) . + the genuine youth of css / gps sources was proved by the determination of both the kinematic @xcite and radiative @xcite ages of a dozen of the most compact objects ( @xmath10 100 pc ) , which turned out to be 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 years .",
    "+ with their typical linear sizes up to a few tens of parsecs , the sub - class of hfp should represent the very first stage in the radio source evolution , with ages of a few hundred years .",
    "their radio properties have been derived by means of a detailed analysis of the flux density variability @xcite , pc - scale morphology @xcite and polarization properties @xcite of the sources from the `` bright '' hfp sample @xcite . from these studies",
    "it became clear that the class of hfps is made of two different populations .",
    "one consists of genuinely young radio sources : they are non - variable , with a double / triple structure resembling a scaled - down version of the classical friis , whose radio emission , unpolarized , is dominated by hotspots / lobes .",
    "the other population is made of blazar sources , characterized by high level of variability , pc - scale core - jet structure and with significant polarized emission .",
    "although blazars usually display a flat radio spectrum , they may show a convex peaked spectrum during particular phases of their variability , i.e. when a self - absorbed knot in the jet dominates the radio emission . in the case of the bright hfp sample ,",
    "almost 60% of the objects have blazar - like properties . + a high percentage of blazar objects in samples of high - frequency peaking objects was found by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite by monitoring the flux density variability of several hfp samples . however , among the hfp / gps sources optically associated with a galaxy the percentage of genuinely young radio sources is larger than in objects hosted in quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that projection and boosting effects play a role in selecting objects in a high - activity state .",
    "+ to investigate and compare the physical characteristics of hfps spanning a broader luminosity range ( l@xmath13 @xmath2 10@xmath14 - 10@xmath15 w / hz ) we performed analysis of the `` faint '' hfp sample @xcite . flux density and spectral",
    "variability studies of the sources in this sample were performed by means of multi - epoch vla observations carried out at various frequencies simultaneously @xcite . from this analysis it turned out that 42% of the sources are non - variable , while 21% are highly variable with their radio spectrum becoming flat at least in one observing epoch , as typical of the blazar population .",
    "the remaining sources maintain the convex peaked spectrum , but with some flux density variability .",
    "however , 37% of them possess a variability that can be explained in terms of a very young radio source undergoing ( adiabatic ) expansion , suggesting that a fraction of variable sources may still be genuinely young objects .",
    "+ in this paper we continue the analysis of the radio properties of the sources from the `` faint '' hfp sample by means of vlba observations at 8.4 and 15.3 ghz . among the 61 sources of the sample we observed the 17 sources whose spectral peak occurred at a frequency below 8.4 ghz .",
    "the availability of two observing frequencies in the optically - thin part of the spectrum allows us to derive the spectral index distribution across the source structure to classify the nature of each sub - component and thus of each source . in the classical picture ,",
    "young radio sources are characterized by a two - sided structure dominated by lobes / hotspots , like the population of compact - symmetric objects ( cso ) . on the other hand ,",
    "one - sided flat - spectrum core - jet structure is typical of boosted sources .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is the following : section 2 describes the vlba observations and the data reduction ; section 3 provides information on the radio morphology and spectral index distribution for each source ; a concise discussion and a brief summary are reported in sections 4 and 5 .",

    "a priori amplitude calibration was derived using measurements of the system temperature and the antenna gains .",
    "the errors on the absolute flux density scale were estimated by comparing the data of either da193 or 4c39.25 with the values reported in the vla / vlba database .",
    "they resulted to be within 10% ( @xmath23 ) . + final images were produced after a number of phase self - calibration iterations .",
    "amplitude self - calibration was applied at the end of the process only for the brightest sources , in order to remove residual systematic errors , and using a solution interval longer than the scan - length .",
    "the flux densities of our targets are generally in agreement with those measured with the vla .",
