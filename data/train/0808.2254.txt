    "recent advances in the trapping and manipulation of ultracold atomic gases have provided experimentalists with the ability to coherently control large numbers of atoms .",
    "two areas that have become the focus of experimental efforts of late are the use of ultracold atoms for the formation and manipulation of molecules @xcite and the creation and manipulation of rydberg atoms in optical lattices  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study whether combining these areas might lead to the production of diatomic molecules whose nuclear position is fixed by an optical lattice ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : setup]a  b ) .",
    "in particular , we examine the properties of ultralarge dimers with equilibrium distances of the order of typical lattice spacings and binding energies of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "we also investigate the prospect of using systems of interacting rydberg atoms to simulate fermi systems .",
    "molecules have a far richer energy structure than atoms , and can also have stronger long - range interactions , a feature which offers new possibilities for quantum control ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , cooling molecules is notably difficult , since the absence of closed electronic transitions prevents the use of standard laser cooling procedures .",
    "an attractive approach to producing translationally cold molecules is thus to form them from pre - cooled atoms by way of photoassociation or magnetic resonance techniques . in recent years several classes of ultracold molecules",
    "have been predicted and produced , including feshbach molecules , efimov trimers , and the famous ` trilobite ' molecules , which are composed of a highly excited rydberg atom interacting with another atom in its ground state  @xcite .",
    "the existence of long - range molecules composed of two rydberg atoms stabilized via dipole - dipole interactions has also been predicted  @xcite .",
    "these ultracold long - range rydberg molecules have binding energies of the order of several hundred mhz ( a factor of @xmath2 greater than the typical temperature of ultracold atoms , but weak by molecular standards ) , a lifetime expected to be similar to that of rydberg atoms , and equilibrium distances of the order of @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 the bohr radius )  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in high - resolution microscopy techniques may offer new possibilities to study the spatial structure of such molecules  @xcite .",
    "theoretical treatments of rydberg molecules to date have primarily dealt with the regime in which the internuclear separation is greater than the le roy radius . in this regime",
    "the overlap between the atomic charge - density distributions is vanishingly small  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works we consider the regime where the internuclear distance of the molecular dimer is comparable to typical lattice spacings , but smaller than the le roy radius , in which case the overlap of the charge distributions and effects such as the exchange interaction must be taken into account .",
    "the simulation of condensed - matter systems is another area to which optical lattices are uniquely suited .",
    "optical lattices have extremely flexible geometries , and by a suitable choice of laser configuration , any desired lattice structure can be created @xcite .",
    "fermions loaded into an optical lattice can be used as a model of electrons in a solid , with the significant advantage of having a periodic potential that is defectless and fully customizable  @xcite . however , the ratio between the currently attainable temperature @xmath5 of fermionic atoms trapped in an optical lattice and the fermi temperature @xmath6 of the system is @xmath7 , preventing the clean observation of such interesting phenomena as the bcs transition or the emergence of certain types of anti - ferromagnetic order  @xcite . in the final section of this paper we consider the possibility of collectively transferring a population of ground - state atoms trapped in an optical lattice to a highly excited rydberg level , such that the charge - density distributions of neighboring atoms overlap  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]c ) .",
    "we extend the model developed in the first section to compute the hopping rate and interaction parameters between the highly excited electrons , and determine the dependence of these quantities on the initial lattice spacing .",
    "while the implementation of these systems is experimentally challenging and beyond the scope of this paper @xcite , we note that experimental temperatures far smaller than the fermi temperature @xmath8 might be readily attainable , making the realisation of such systems a promising new approach to the quantum simulation of interacting fermions .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mol ] we present the model that we subsequently use to investigate the existence of attractive molecular potentials with equilibrium distances below the le roy radius .",
    "we approximate the lifetime of these molecules and calculate their equilibrium internuclear distance for different values of the principal quantum number of the electrons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simul ] we use the model introduced in the first section to compute the hopping rate and interaction parameters of the rydberg electrons and discuss the possibility of using these setups to simulate condensed - matter systems .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we present a method of evaluating the energy of highly excited diatomic molecular states whose equilibrium distance @xmath9 is below the le roy radius .",
    "we develop an efficient method of computing one- and two - center molecular integrals over electronic orbitals with large principal quantum numbers @xmath10 and calculate the depth and equilibrium position of molecular potentials accessible from the ground state via photoassociation for values of @xmath10 up to @xmath11 .",
    "we estimate the radiative lifetime of the highly excited molecular potentials .",
    "quantum chemistry methods commonly used within the le roy radius typically become computationally expensive when dealing with rydberg molecules due to the size of the basis set required to describe the spatially diffuse rydberg orbitals . in order to obtain qualitative results in this computationally challenging regime we take a simple wavefunction _ ansatz _ inspired by the heitler - london treatment of the hydrogen molecule . due to the simplistic form of the molecular wavefunctions used we",
    "do not expect the method presented to produce quantitatively accurate results ; rather , our aim is to obtain qualitatively correct results and insights within a regime where common methods of calculating molecular potentials fail or become computationally costly .",
    "we consider an optical lattice potential forming an array of double - wells separated from each other by sufficiently high optical barriers that each double well can be considered as an isolated system  @xcite .",
    "we assume that each double well initially contains two @xmath12 atoms in their ground state , and that the potential is sufficiently deep that the wannier function associated with each atom is well localized in one half of the well . because alkali atoms have only a single valence electron , their energy levels are described by the same quantum numbers as those of the hydrogen atom .",
    "if the ground - state atoms are excited to rydberg levels with @xmath13 by applying a laser pulse to the system , the charge distributions of atoms in the same double well will overlap , and under certain conditions a stable molecular state will be formed .",
    "we aim to study the basic properties of these molecules and explore whether they may be produced in an optical lattice with experimentally realistic parameters .",
    "since the temperature of the system is very low , the velocity of the electrons  even in highly excited states  is much greater than that of the trapped ions , and the electrons respond almost instantaneously to displacements of the ions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we will calculate molecular potentials in the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "neglecting interactions between atoms belonging to different double wells , the energy of a homonuclear molecule formed by the atoms in a double well is given within the bo approximation by the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the position of the @xmath17 electron ; @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the distance between the @xmath17 electron and atomic center @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the distance between the two electrons ; @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the permittivity of free space and @xmath24 the elementary unit of charge ; and @xmath25 is the distance between the nuclei . in the bo approximation @xmath25 is treated as a classical variable upon which the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian depend parametrically . following a similar approach to that of ref .",

    "the basis elements that are symmetric or anti - symmetric in the coordinates have an associated anti - symmetric ( singlet ) or symmetric ( triplet ) function of spins respectively .",
    "each basis state   describes the two electrons being exchanged between the two nuclei , and corresponds to an _ ansatz _ for a valence - bond wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian using the states as a basis correspond to the molecular potentials obtained using the heitler - london method  @xcite .",
    "the hydrogenic wavefunction of the valence electron centered on atom @xmath20 located at @xmath32 is well approximated by the ( unnormalized ) function @xmath33 here @xmath34 with @xmath35 the radial distance from atomic center @xmath20 , @xmath36 is the angle between the vector @xmath32 and the internuclear axis , @xmath37 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath38 is a legendre polynomial , and @xmath39 is the effective principal quantum number , with @xmath40 a quantum defect whose value depends on the angular momentum quantum number @xmath41 and the atomic species  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 $ ] are defined recursively with @xmath43 and @xmath44 is an integer satisfying @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the orbital defined in eq .",
    "is known as the asymptotic form of the quantum defect wavefunction ; for @xmath46 , it is identical to the hydrogenic wavefunction , while for @xmath47 it provides an accurate description of a rydberg electron in the mid- and long - range .",
    "it differs significantly from the exact quantum defect wavefunction only at short distances from the atomic cores , which is of little consequence since the interactions we consider here depend mainly on the outer part of the atomic wavefunctions .    for @xmath48 ,",
    "the overlap between the charge - density distributions of atoms separated by distances smaller than the le roy radius ( for @xmath49 ) is typically of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "the charge - density overlap is therefore not negligible in this regime , and the approximation of the coulomb potential using the multipole expansion  @xcite is not suitable .",
    "the multipole expansion diverges quite significantly from the coulomb potential even in the presence of small charge - density overlap , and so the results obtained using this approximation below the le roy radius are very uncertain  @xcite .",
    "we consequently estimate the energy of the dimer by evaluating the expectation value of the hamiltonian   in the states , a task which requires the evaluation of a number of integrals over atomic orbitals .",
    "these integrals fall into two classes : the _ one - center _ integrals , comprising the overlap integral @xmath51 , the coulomb integral @xmath52 , and the charge overlap integral @xmath53 ; and the _ two - center _",

    "the results of such integrals using direct numerical integration converge extremely slowly , and the answers so produced can suffer from dramatic losses of accuracy ( a phenomenon known as numerical erosion ; see e.g.  @xcite ) . following an approach suggested by m.  p.  barnett , we use a computer algebra - based method to generate analytical formulae for the molecular integrals  @xcite .",
    "we have found this approach advantageous for three reasons : ( i ) it permits the fast evaluation of molecular integrals with high principal quantum number to arbitrary accuracy ; ( ii ) once the analytical form has been found , the evaluation of an integral for different values of the internuclear distance is instantaneous ; ( iii ) the analytical expressions of the integrals can be stored and re - used at little computational cost .",
    "however , even with the use of symbolic calculations , the evaluation of molecular integrals for large values of @xmath10 is computationally demanding .",
    "in order to make these calculations tractable for large @xmath10 we restrict the value of the projection of the electronic angular momentum along the internuclear axis to @xmath56 .",
    "this limits the range of molecular states that can be investigated to those of symmetry @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; these are associated with the @xmath59 and @xmath60 basis states respectively .",

    "every one - center integral can be converted into an analytical expression with parametric dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "the evaluation of symbolic expressions for two - center integrals proceeds similarly , although many more replacement rules are required .",
    "the general approach for two - center integrals consists of expressing the coulomb potential in the form of a sum of polynomials ( such as the legendre or neumann expansion ) before applying replacement rules on the terms resulting from the successive integrations over the coordinates of the first and second valence electron . using this method ,",

    "( see appendix  [ app : rules ] ) .",
    "since we envisage producing the rydberg dimers by applying a laser pulse to a system of ground - state atoms , we are primarily interested in the molecular states that are most strongly coupled to ground - state atoms by the dipole transition operator ; namely , those of @xmath75 symmetry with a high @xmath76-character ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we will therefore restrict our analysis to these states .",
    "however , for values of @xmath78 molecular states of @xmath75 and @xmath79 symmetry become quasi - degenerate @xcite , and so the results presented here apply to molecular states of either of these symmetries .",

    "@xcite , this is probably a consequence of the inaccuracy of the multipole expansion below the le roy radius . although the potentials produced using our method do not have the asymptotic @xmath94 behaviour expected from perturbation theory @xcite , this may be corrected by carrying out a numerical integration of the terms which were neglected during the symbolical calculations of the molecular integrals .",

    "[ fig : molecular ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coupling between different states is generally weak ( off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are typically @xmath117 smaller than diagonal ones ) and the strongest coupling is seen between states with identical angular momentum .",

    "we approximate the true bound vibrational wavefunctions @xmath154 by the eigenstates of a harmonic approximation to the molecular potential centered about @xmath155 .",
    "due to the asymmetric nature of the molecular potential curves , this approximation becomes progressively worse as @xmath129 increases .",
    "however , we expect that the ability to impose an interatomic spacing close to the equilibrium distance of the targeted molecular state before applying the photoassociation pulse will provide a measure of control over the range of vibrational levels occupied by the molecules , thus making the lowest vibrational levels the most relevant .    although there are a huge number of final states to which the molecule could decay , the dependence of the decay rate given by eq .   on @xmath156 favors transitions that involve the emission of a high - energy photon .",

    "if realized , such a system would allow the observation of a phase transition between the sdw and cdw phases , by , for example , the measurement of the zero - frequency sdw susceptibility   and @xmath214 , where @xmath215 and @xmath216 . ] or the cdw structure factor , both of which diverge linearly in their respective phase  @xcite .",
    "further , the versatility of optical lattice setups may allow the excitation of rydberg atoms with a given angular momentum , which potentially enables exotic quantum phase transitions to be engineered : indeed , the value of the electronic angular momentum not only influences the relative values of the system interaction parameters , but also in some cases their signs  ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "this feature is particularly interesting , as it is the mechanism behind e.g.  the emergence of non - trivial and rich phase diagrams in doped cuprates ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "finally , if in addition the electron density could be controlled when producing one of these states , it would provide the exciting possibility of turning the state of the electrons into a superconductor , as happens in the case of doping - induced superconductivity in cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the parameters calculated in this work apply to models where the dynamics of the electrons is restricted to one mode per site .    in future works , it would be interesting to determine the conditions for this assumption to be valid , and whether these conditions can be engineered with current technology .",
    "results in this direction would allow excitation schemes to be devised , and also the determination of the control available to tune the density of electrons in the lattice .",
    "also , dynamical calculations aiming at characterizing the lifetime of the lattice configuration after the atoms have been excited to rydberg levels would allow the evaluation of the time - scale available to interrogate the system .",
    "the exact calculation of this lifetime is an open problem whose solution is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , the dynamics of our system happens on a time scale of a few hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "techniques for probing electron dynamics on the femto - second time scale exist in condensed matter systems ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ) . these methods might form the basis for resolving the motion of electrons in a rydberg gas on pico- to femto - second timescales in future experiments .",
    "the use of our scheme for the purpose of quantum simulation requires the lifetime of the lattice configuration to be longer than the typical timescales of the dynamics . as mentioned by mourachko _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interatomic spacing ( @xmath217 m ) between rydberg atoms in a frozen gas varies very little ( @xmath218% ) over a period of time of the order of 1 @xmath164s , some three orders of magnitude larger than the typical hopping times present in the system we have proposed . also , as already mentioned by li _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite fixing the initial positions of the atoms will help reducing the motion of the ion cores .",
    "we therefore believe that rydberg gases created from ultracold atoms in an optical lattice provide a promising route towards the direct quantum simulation of interacting fermi systems .",

    "the angular part of these integrals will be non - zero for only a few terms ; for instance , for @xmath237 , the angular part is non - zero for @xmath238 , and for @xmath239 for @xmath240 .",
