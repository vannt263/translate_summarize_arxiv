    "the presence of large amounts of dark matter at the galactic lengthscale is already an established fact . assuming that this dark matter is a gas ( or gas mixture ) of various particles species , the established classification criteria labels possible dark matter forms as `` cold '' or `` hot '' , depending on the relativistic or non - relativistic nature of the particles energetic spectrum at their decoupling from the cosmic mixture @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hot dark matter ( hdm ) scenarios seem to be incompatible with current theories of structure formation and thus , are not favoured dark matter candidates @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) , usualy examined within a newtonian framework , can be considered as non - interactive ( a self gravitating gas of collisionless particles ) or self - interactive @xcite .",
    "cdm models are often developed in terms of n - body numerical simmulations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "non - interactive cdm models present the following discrepancies with observations at the galactic scale @xcite , @xcite : ( a ) the `` substructure problem '' related to excess clustering on sub - galactic scales , ( b ) the `` cusp problem '' characterized by a monotonic increase of density towards the center of halos , leading to excessively concentrated cores .",
    "these problems appear in the more recent numerical simulations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in order to deal with these problems ,",
    "the possibility of self - interacting dark matter has been considered , so that nonzero pressure or thermal effects can emerge , thus leading to self - interactive models of cdm ( _ i.e. _ scdm ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and `` warm '' dark matter ( wdm ) models @xcite-@xcite that challenges the duality cdm vs. hdm .",
    "other proposed dark matter sources consist replacing the gas of particles approach by scalar fields @xcite , @xcite and even more `` exotic '' sources @xcite .    whether based on scdm or wdm , current theories of structure formation point towards dark matter characterized by particles having a mass of the order of at least kev s ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , thus suggesting that massive but light particles , such as electron neutrinos and axions ( see table  1 ) , should be eliminated as primary dark matter candidates ( though there is no reason to assume that these particles would be absent in galactic halos ) . of all possible particle candidates ( denoted as wimp s : weakly interactive massive particles ) complying with the required mass value of relique gases , only the massive neutrinos ( the muon or tau neutrinos ) , have been detected , whereas other wimps ( gravitino , sterile neutrino , axino , etc . )",
    "are speculative .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and table  1 for a list of candidate particles and appropriate references .",
    "even if the dynamics of visible matter in galaxies can be described succesfuly with newtonian gravity , we believe that general relativity is an appropriate framework for understanding basic features of galactic dark matter , a gravitational field source whose precise physical nature still remains an open question .",
    "if the results obtained with gr coincide with newtonian results , then there is no harm done from a pragmatic calculations - oriented point of view .",
    "however , from a formal - theoretical approach , we believe it is beneficial to broaden the scope of the study of galactic dynamics by incorporating it to a more general gravitational theory . in particular , in this paper",
    "we aim at testing the compatibility between observed galactic rotation curves and simple thermodynamical assumptions under the framework of gr .",
    "since dark matter halo probably constitutes the overwhelming mayority ( 90 % ) of the galactic mass , an alternative approach to numerical simulations and newtonian hydrodynamics follows by a general relativistic model describing the gravitational field of the galaxy as a spacetime geometry generated by the the dark matter halo ( as a self gravitating gas ) , hence visible matter becomes test particles that evolve along stable geodesics of this spacetime .",
    "there is strong empiric evidence that the radial profile of rotational velocities ( `` rotation curves '' ) in most galaxies roughly fits a `` universal rotation curve '' ( urc ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this urc is characterized by a `` flattening '' effect whereby rotation velocities tend to a constant `` terminal '' velocity whose value depends on the type of galaxy ( between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the profile of rotation curves identifies two main contributions of galactic matter : visible matter ( the disk ) , showing a keplerian decay , and dark matter ( the halo ) , explaining the flattening effect .",
    "this kinematic evidence might allow us to determine ( at least partialy ) the geometry of the spacetime associated with a self gravitating galaxy .",
    "in other words , our approach somehow inverts the standard initial value procedure in general relativistic hydrodynamics : instead of prescribing initial data based on physicaly motivated sources and then find the geometry of spacetime and the trayectories of test particles after solving einstein s equations , we provide first constraints on the geometry of spacetime ( from symmetry criteria and empirical kinematic data ) and then find , with the help of the field equations , the corresponding momentum - energy tensor of the sources .",
    "this approach to galactic dark matter has been used in connection to scalar fields @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that the dark matter halo overwhelmingly dominates the galactic matter content ( at least in the halo region ) , we shall assume that the galactic halo ( as a self gravitating gas ) is the unique matter source of the galactic spacetime .",
    "visible matter becomes then test observers that follow stable circular geodesic orbits ( the galactic rotation curves ) of this spacetime .",
    "following the `` inverse '' approach described above , we propose to use the empiric law governing the form of the urc for the galactic halo ( see @xcite and @xcite ) in order to make specific asertions on the nature of the sources of the galactic spacetime . considering the self - gravitating galactic halo gas to be self - interactive ( instead of colissionless matter or a scalar field ) , we aim at verifying if the assumption of the urc profile for the rotation velocity of geodesic observers ( rotation curves ) is compatible with the assumption that the galactic halo gas is a simple self - gravitating and self - interactive gas in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the galactic halo to be a spacetime characterized as : ( a ) sphericaly symmetric , ( b ) its energy - momentum tensor is that of a perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state of an equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann gas in its non - relativistic limit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "assumption ( a ) is supported by observations in the halo of galaxies , while ( b ) is the central hypothesis in the present work .",
    "assumption ( b ) requires spacetime to be stationary ( static if rotation vanishes ) and leads to a law relating temperature gradients with the 4-acceleration ( tolman law ) .",
    "then , since we are assuming the validity of the empiric urc for the galactic halo , we need to cast the field equations and the conditions imposed by the thermodynamics in terms of this rotation velocity ( _ i.e. _ the velocity of test particles in stable geodesic orbits ) , considered now as a dynamical variable . using the urc empiric law as an _ ansatz _ for this velocity immediately leads to expressions for the state variables that are ( under suitable approximations ) consistent with the thermodynamics of the non - relativistic maxwell - boltzmann ideal gas . from these expressions and bearing in mind numerical estimates of the empiric parameters appearing in the urc ( `` terminal '' rotation velocities and the `` core radius '' ) ,",
    "we obtain : ( 1 ) a constraint on the ratio of the particles mass to temperature for this gas , ( 2 ) the criterion of applicability of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( _ i.e. _ the non - degeneracy criterion ) @xcite , leading to a minimal bound of about @xmath9 to @xmath10 ev for the mass of the gas particles .",
    "therefore , the assumption of a maxwell - boltzmann gas ( scdm or wdm ) model for the galactic halo leads to an acceptable value for the particle s mass lying in the range @xmath11 .",
    "we provide in table  1 a list of particle candidates that could be accomodated according to the criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above , namely : neutralino , photino , light gravitino , sterile neutrino , dilaton , axino , majoron , mirror neutrino and possibly standard massive neutrinos .",
    "as mentioned previously , this mass range is compatible with predictions of current work based on scdm and wdm structure formation models .",
    "we find it interesting to remark that barions and electrons comply with the criterion ( 2 ) above , but ( 1 ) would imply gas temperatures of the order of @xmath12 k. a gas of barions or electrons at such temperatures would certainly not be `` dark '' .",
    "hdm or wdm models based on less massive particles , like the electron neutrino , remain outside the scope of the present work , since these particles might require assuming a fuly relativistic maxwell - boltzmann gas or a degenerate gas ( possibly relativistic ) complying with a fermi - dirac or bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the axion , as well as other non - thermal relique sources , are also outside the scope of this paper and their study requires a different approach .",
    "the paper is composed as follows . in the next section we present the field equations for a static sphericaly symmetric spacetime with a perfect fluid source .",
    "we provide in section 3 a review of the thermodynamics of an equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann gas .",
    "then , in section 4 , we re - write the field equations in terms of the orbital velocity of stable circular geodesics and then assume for this velocity the empiric _ ansatz _ given by the urc .",
    "this leads to forms of the state variables that will be compatible , under suitable series approximations , with the thermodynamics of the maxwell - boltzmann gas .",
    "putting all these results together , we discuss in the last section the possible ranges for the mass of the particles of the dark halo gas and suggest future lines of research .",
    "as mentioned above , we consider the halo to be spherically symmetric and is the determining component of the stress energy tensor determining the geometry .",
    "thus , we consider the line element of an spherically symmetric space time :    @xmath13    assuming as the source of such line element a static perfect fluid momentum energy tensor @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , we obtain the following field equations    @xmath16",
    "@xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath20 . as mentioned in the introduction ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , it is possible ( by working with einstein s equations backwards ) to impose constrains on the geometry of the spacetime that yield valuable information regarding the type of matter sources curving such spacetime .",
    "we apply this reasoning to the observed velocity profile of stars orbiting around a galaxy , considered as test particles moving in stable circular geodesics . knowing the specific form of the velocity profiles around these geodesics should allow us to infere at least basic features on the nature sources producing the galactic field . for a sphericaly symmetric spacetime ( [ eq : ele0 ] ) ,",
    "the energy , @xmath21 , and the angular momentum , @xmath22 , are conserved quantities for any particle moving in a geodesic , hence the geodesic equation for the radial motion has the following form :    @xmath23    where a dot denotes derivative with respect to the affine parameter of the geodesic . for a test particle to be in stable circular geodesic motion in any static spherically symmetric space time , its energy and angular momentum must satisfy :    @xmath24    the tangential velocity of these test particles , @xmath25 ,",
    "can also be expressed in terms of the metric coefficients as :    @xmath26    in previous work ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) this tangential velocity was assumed to be constant along the full domain of the solution . in the present paper",
    "we consider @xmath27 and eliminate the metric coefficient , @xmath28 , and its derivatives in ( [ eq : rho1])-([eq : p1 ] ) in terms of the tangential velocity , @xmath29 , as given by eq.([eq : vt ] ) .",
    "this leads to a form for the field equations in which @xmath30 becomes a dynamical variable replacing @xmath28 .",
    "after some algebraic manipulation , equation ( [ eq : p1 ] ) becomes the following constraint relating the metric function @xmath31 and the tangential velocity :    @xmath32    substitution of this last equation into equations ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p1 ] ) provides the following expressions for the density and the pressure of the fluid in terms of @xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 :    @xmath35 m+4\\,{r}^{2}vv^{\\prime } + 2\\,{v}^{2}\\left ( -2+{v}^{2}\\right ) r}{{r}^{3}\\left ( 1+{v}^{2}\\right ) } } .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{eq : rp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is remarkable to see how the replacement of @xmath36 by @xmath33 considerably simplifies the field equations for a general static and sphericaly symmetric field with a perfect fluid source .",
    "writing the field equations in terms of the orbital velocity , @xmath33 , provides a useful insight into how an ( in principle ) observable quantity relates to spacetime curvature and with physical quantities ( state variables ) which characterize the source of spacetime .",
    "thus , given an empirical functional form for @xmath30 ( a rotation `` profile '' for test particles ) , we can obtain @xmath37 by integrating the constraint ( [ eq : const ] ) and thus , we arrive to fully determined forms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in ( [ eq : rp ] ) .",
    "we aim at verifying if the empiric laws associated with galactic rotation curves ( hence , associated with @xmath30 ) can be compatible with matter sources that satisfy basic physical considerations and principles .",
    "since galactic dark matter is , most probably , non - relativistic and the assumption of a perfect fluid source for the static metric ( [ eq : ele0 ] ) points to an equilibrium configuration , it is tempting to verify if @xmath40 and @xmath39 associated with a given empirical form for @xmath30 correspond to state variables characteristic of simple , non - relativistic systems in thermodynamically equilibrium , such as a suitable ideal gas in its non - relativistic limit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the self gravitating ideal `` dark '' gas exists in physical conditions far from those in which the quantum properties of the gas particles are relevant , we would be demanding that these particles comply with maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics . following @xcite , the `` non - degeneracy '' condition that justifies an mb distribution",
    "is given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are , respectively , the particle number density , absolute temperature , planck s and boltzmann s constants . if the constraint ( [ eq : landau ] ) holds and we further assume thermodynamical equilibrium and non - relativistic conditions , the ideal dark gas must satisfy the equation of state of a non - relativistic monatomic ideal gas    @xmath46    whose macroscopic state variables can be obtained from a mb distribution function under an equilibrium kinetic theory approach ( the non - relativistic and non - degenerate limit of the jttner distribution ) @xcite . an equilibrium mb distribution restricts the geometry of spacetime @xcite , resulting in the existence of a timelike killing vector field @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , as well as the following relation ( tolman s law ) between the 4-acceleration and the temperature gradient    @xmath49    leading to    @xmath50    the particle number density @xmath42 trivialy satisfies the conservation law @xmath51 where @xmath52 , thus the number of dark particles is conserved .",
    "notice that given ( [ eq : rp ] ) , the equation of state ( [ eq : mb ] ) and the temperature from the tolman law ( [ eq : ttolman ] ) , we have two different expressions for @xmath42    @xmath53    @xmath54 ,    \\label{eq : n2}\\ ] ]    the quantity @xmath55 in ( [ eq : n2 ] ) follows directly from equations ( [ eq : rp ] )    @xmath56 m+4\\,vv^{\\prime } \\,{r}^{2}-{v}^{2}\\left ( 7+{v}^{2}\\right ) r}{{r}^{3}\\left ( 1+{v}^{2}\\right ) } } ,    \\label{eq : rn}\\ ] ]    while @xmath42 in ( [ eq : n1 ] ) also follows from @xmath39 in ( [ eq : rp ] ) with @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "consistency requires that ( [ eq : n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) yield the same expression for @xmath42 .",
    "so far we have expressed the field equations and the thermodynamics of the fluid source in terms of the tangential velocities @xmath30 and the effective mass - energy @xmath37 .",
    "if the dark matter component dominates the dynamics of the fluid , we can ignore the contribution from visible matter ( barions ) and assume that the matter source is made exclusively of this dark matter component . a useful strategy to follow",
    "is then to prescribe , as a functional form for @xmath30 , the empiric _ ansatz _ of the radial profile of tangential velocities of dark matter halo obtained from the `` universal rotation curve '' ( urc ) that roughly fits observed galactic rotation curves @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this empirical form can be used in equations ( [ eq : const ] ) and ( [ eq : rp ] ) . the function @xmath37 follows by solving the constraint ( [ eq : const ] ) , subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the obtained @xmath31 together with the prescribed @xmath33 yield fully determined forms for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the metric coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "next we can verify compatibility of @xmath42 obtained from ( [ eq : n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) .",
    "finaly , we should be able to estimate the ratio @xmath58 which in turn , from estimations of masses from particle physics , leads to an estimation of the temperature of the dark gas in terms of the particles mass .",
    "we shall assume for @xmath59 the empiric dark halo rotation velocity law given by persic and salucci @xcite , @xcite    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the `` optical radius '' containing 83 % of the galactic luminosity , whereas the empiric parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , the ratio of `` halo core radius '' to @xmath61 and the `` terminal '' rotation velocity , depend on the galactic luminosity .",

    "<S> we consider simple hydrodynamical models of galactic dark matter in which the galactic halo is a self - gravitating and self - interacting gas that dominates the dynamics of the galaxy . modeling this halo as a sphericaly symmetric and static perfect fluid satisfying the field equations of general relativity , </S>",
    "<S> visible barionic matter can be treated as `` test particles '' in the geometry of this field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the assumption of an empirical `` universal rotation curve '' that fits a wide variety of galaxies is compatible , under suitable approximations , with state variables characteristic of a non - relativistic maxwell - boltzmann gas that becomes an isothermal sphere in the newtonian limit . </S>",
    "<S> consistency criteria lead to a minimal bound for particle masses in the range @xmath0 and to a constraint between the central temperature and the particles mass . </S>",
    "<S> the allowed mass range includes popular supersymmetric particle candidates , such as the neutralino , axino and gravitino , as well as lighter particles ( @xmath1 kev ) proposed by numerical n - body simulations associated with self - interactive cdm and wdm structure formation theories .    </S>",
