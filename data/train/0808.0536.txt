    "<S> the pioneer work on transformation optics and cloaking [ 1 - 4 ] has suggested a new kind of methodology to manipulate the electromagnetic ( em ) waves by means of the metamaterials . </S>",

    "<S> chen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ has recently proposed the `` imperfect cloak '' [ 7 ] which can reduce the scattering cross section of an object . </S>",
    "<S> start from this imperfect cloak , they also suggested a design of `` dispersive cloak '' . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the imperfect cloak , a concept of `` superscatterer '' [ 12 ] was also proposed which can obtain a giant scattering cross section beyond the device itself . </S>",
    "<S> if the inner core of the concentrator [ 11 ] is replaced with a pec cylinder , the concentrator can employed as a device to change the scattering cross section of the pec cylinder . and its functionality is between the imperfect cloak and the superscatterer . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a cylindrical cloak of arbitrary cross section [ 10 ] has been given , which can be easily extended to the imperfect cloak , concentrator , and superscatterer . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we will show the method of such an extension . and based on our methodology , we will propose a kind of transformation media , which we shall call the `` pec reshaper '' . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit design will be given . </S>",
    "<S> the pec reshaper can reshape the pec cylinder at will . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the effective pec cylinder can be partially inside the device and partially outside the device . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate the properties of the pec reshaper by using the finite - element methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the general coordinate transformation is given by the following relation ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 which are three functions that specify the inner and outer boundaries of the transformation media and the boundary of an imaginary cylinder which will be useful later , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we note that all the boundaries are smooth and non - convex </S>",
    "<S> . this transformation maps the field in the domain @xmath2 onto another domain @xmath3 . from the transformation optics , </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain the parameters inside the transformation media in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the transverse electric ( te ) mode for simplicity and suppose that the inner cylinder ( @xmath5 is a pec cylinder . in the view of transformation optics , after coated with the transformation media in @xmath6 , the inner pec cylinder ( @xmath5 looks like another effective pec cylinder in the domain @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , the transformation media is an imperfect cylindrical cloak [ 7 , 8 ] with arbitrary cross section , which can reduce the cross section of the inner pec cylinder ( see in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) . if @xmath9 , the imperfect cylindrical cloak becomes perfect [ 1 , 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 , the transformation media is the outer shell of a cylindrical concentrator [ 11 ] with arbitrary cross section , which can enhance the cross section of the inner pec cylinder ( see in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . we shall still call the device `` concentrator '' for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effective pec cylinder is still within the domain @xmath11 . with the help of the concept of `` superscatterer '' [ 12 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we can reshape the inner pec cylinder very versatilely . in the case of superscatterer </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. @xmath12 , the transformation maps the field in the domain @xmath13 onto another domain @xmath14 through the mirror of @xmath15 . the superscatterer can enhance the cross section of the inner pec cylinder to that of an effective pec cylinder which can be much larger than the device ( see in fig . </S>",

    "<S> such a device combines cloak , concentrator and superscatterer all together into one case , which we shall call the `` pec reshaper '' as it could reshape the pec boundary more or less arbitrarily .    before demonstrating the properties of the pec reshaper </S>",
