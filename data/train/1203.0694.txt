    "as a cornerstone of the standard model ( sm ) and also the last undiscovered piece , the higgs boson has been intensively searched in collider experiments . the foregone colliders lep ii and tevatron yielded null search results , setting a lower bound of 114.4 gev on the higgs mass @xcite and excluding a higgs boson with a mass around @xmath5 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the ongoing large hadron collider ( lhc ) took over the higgs - hunting task and recently reported its search results . based on an integrated luminosity of 4.9 @xmath6 collected at @xmath7 ,",
    "the two experimental groups at the lhc independently further narrowed down the higgs mass region ( at @xmath8 c.l .",
    "the cms collaboration excluded 127 - 600 gev while the atlas collaboration excluded 112.9 - 115.5 gev , 131 - 238 gev and 251 - 466 gev ) and both hinted to a higgs boson around 125 gev @xcite .",
    "such a finding has stimulated some theoretical studies for a higgs boson near 125 gev in low energy supersymmetry @xcite and other models @xcite .",
    "of course , if the lhc hint of a 125 gev higgs from the di - photon channel is confirmed in the future , it would severely constrain or exclude those new physics models in which some new exotic decay modes ( such as decaying invisibly into dark matter ) are open and the di - photon rate is suppressed .",
    "but so far the statistics at the lhc is too small to confirm such a higgs , let alone the precision measurement of the higgs decay branching ratios .",
    "therefore , experimentally it is still allowed for the higgs boson to decay exotically , such as invisibly to dark matter , with a sizable branching ratio .",
    "is allowed . ]    theoretically , the higgs decay to dark matter can indeed occur in some new physics models , such as the gauge singlet extensions of the sm @xcite , the sm with a heavy fourth generation @xcite , the large extra dimension model @xcite , the technicolor model @xcite , the spontaneously broken r - parity models @xcite and the non - linearly realized supersymmetric model @xcite and the mssm with a singlet @xcite . in this work , we perform a comparative study for the higgs decay to neutralino dark matter in low energy susy by considering three different models : the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard models ( nmssm ) @xcite and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite . as will be shown , in both the nmssm and nmssm",
    ", the sm - like higgs boson can decay to neutralino dark matter with a sizable branching ratio .    in case that the higgs boson decays to dark matter with a sizable branching ratio , detecting such a decay at the lhc will be important because in this case the conventional visible decays into @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are often suppressed .",
    "obviously , the main production channel via gluon fusion @xmath14 is not usable because it just gives missing energy .",
    "it was found through monte carlo simulations that the production via vector boson fusion ( vbf ) @xmath15 and the associated productions @xmath16 and @xmath17 can offer the opportunity to detect the higgs decay to dark matter @xcite . so in this work we choose these three production channels to display the observability of higgs decay to dark matter in low energy susy .",
    "note that although in the literature the higgs decay to nutralino dark matter has been discussed in some specific model like mssm , it is necessary to give a revisit in low energy susy for two reasons : ( i ) different susy models usually give rather different phenomenology and it is interesting to perform a comparative study for different models ; ( ii ) we want to know in the susy parameter space allowed by current experiments whether or not the higgs decay to nutralino dark matter is detectable at the lhc .",
    "if in some model this decay is found to be accessible at the lhc , we further want to know how large the parameter space can be covered by searching for such an invisible decay at the lhc .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the three supersymmetric models . in sec .",
    "iii , through a scan over the parameter space we present the branching ratio of higgs decay to neutralino dark matter and show the observability at the lhc . finally , the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "in a renormalizable supersymmetric field theory , the interactions and masses of all particles are determined by their gauge transformation properties and superpotential .",
    "the superpotential is a holomorphic function of chiral superfields @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 being respectively the bosonic , fermionic and auxiliary fields , and takes a form @xcite @xmath22 where the parameters @xmath23 should be of dimension @xmath24^{2}$ ] and is only allowed if @xmath25 is a gauge singlet .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath26 can only be non - zero when the supermultiplets @xmath25 and @xmath27 are conjugates of each other under gauge transformation . and the massless coefficients @xmath28 can only be non - zero when @xmath29 formed a gauge singlet .",
    "the mssm is the most economized realization of supersymmetry in particle physics , which has two higgs doublets @xmath30 and @xmath31 and its superpotential is given by @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 given by @xmath34 the mssm has the so - called @xmath35-problem , which can be solved in some extensions by introducing a higgs singlet @xmath36 . among these extensions the most popular ones are",

    "in the nmssm and nmssm there are five neutralinos ( @xmath66 ) , which are the mixture of bino ( @xmath67 ) , wino ( @xmath68 ) , higgsino ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) and singlino ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 we assume the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and make up of the cosmic dark matter .    for the purpose of our numerical analysis , we present the interactions of the higgs bosons @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the the nmssm , they are given by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding couplings in the nmssm can be obtained by setting @xmath80 equal to zero ( for mssm , setting @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 to zero ) .",
    "for the nmssm , in the basis @xmath84 , the tree - level neutralino mass matrix takes the form @xcite @xmath85 the corresponding mass matrix for the mssm can be obtained by taking the upper 4 @xmath86 4 matrix from the above expression , and for the nmssm it can be obtained by set the term @xmath87 to zero . when @xmath88 or @xmath89 , the lightest neutralino in the mssm becomes bino - like , with a mass given by @xcite @xmath90 in the nmssm",
    "the lightest neutralino is singlino - like and its mass can be approximated as @xcite @xmath91",

    "we require the models to explain the cosmic dark matter relic density measured by wmap @xcite and also explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment at @xmath0 level .",
    "in addition , we consider the following experimental constraints :    1 .   the lep bounds on sparticle masses and on the higgs sector from @xmath93 followed by @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xcite ; we also consider the lep - i constraints on the invisible @xmath56 decay , decay are stringent for a wino - like or higgsino - like neutralino , but become quite weak for a bino - like or singlino - like neutralino . ]",

    "for the mssm : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 . in this space",
    "we scan two million random points and about three thousands points survived the experimental constraints .",
    "2 .   for the nmssm : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 . in this space",

    "3 .   for the nmssm : @xmath122 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath127 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 . in this space",
    "we scan one billion random points and about 2 thousands points survived .",
    "note that our scan is not a general scan over the entire parameter space .",
    "since our purpose is to figure out if the invisible decay of the higgs boson is accessible at the lhc , we only scanned over a part of parameter space which is potentially able to allow for a light neutralino and hence the higgs can decay into the neutralino pair .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we display the scatter plots of the parameter space which survive all constraints .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the higgs decay branching ratios and the lhc ( 7 tev ) di - photon rate , while fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the observability of the decay @xmath133 through three production channels at the lhc ( 7 tev ) . the @xmath0 sensitivity of the atlas detector shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is obtained from a monte carlo simulation carried out in @xcite . for the decay @xmath133 , the signature of the production via vector boson fusion @xmath2 is two far forward and backward tagging jets of moderate @xmath134 with considerable missing momentum @xmath135 in the central region . for the productions @xmath136 and @xmath137 , the signatures are obvious : for the former it is two isolated high @xmath134 leptons from the z - boson decay and large missing @xmath135 from the higgs decay ; for the latter it is di - leptons ( or lepton plus jets ) and large missing @xmath135 .    from these figures",
    "we obtain the following findings :    * in each model the sm - like higgs can have a mass near 125 gev , as hinted by the recent lhc results . * in the mssm the sm - like higgs boson dominantly decays to @xmath74 ( just like in the sm ) , the decay @xmath138 has a very small branching ratio ( below about @xmath139 ) , and the di - photon signal rate is close to the sm value . due to the small branching ratio ,",
    "the higgs decay @xmath138 is far below the detectable level .",
    "* in the nmssm the decay @xmath140 can be comparable to @xmath141 . in the region with a sizable decay ratio of @xmath140 ,",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath142 is rather light ( below @xmath143 ) and the coupling of @xmath58 to @xmath142 is large ( see eq .",
    "[ ghxx ] ) . the diphoton signal rate can be sizably deviate from the sm prediction , either enhanced or suppressed significantly . in a large part of the parameter space ,",
    "the higgs decay @xmath140 is accessible at the lhc . * in a major part of the parameter space in the nmssm , the decay @xmath140 is dominant over @xmath141 and thus observable at the lhc .",
    "the reason is the lightest neutralino is singlino - like and is always light , as can be seen from the neutralino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ mx - nmssm ] ) . also , from eq .",
    "( [ ghxx ] ) we see that the coupling @xmath144 can be large ( near unity ) . due to the new sizable decay @xmath140",
    ", the total width of the sm - like higgs is greatly enlarged and thus its di - photon signal at the lhc is severely suppressed .",
    "so , if the recently observed di - photon signals at the lhc is verified in the near future , this model will be excluded .",
    "we examined the higgs decay to neutralino dark matter in low energy susy by considering three different models : the mssm , nmssm and nmssm .",
    "we considered current experimental constraints at @xmath0 level ( including the muon @xmath1 and the dark matter relic density ) and scanned over the parameter space of each model .",
    "then in the allowed parameter space we calculated the branching ratio of the sm - like higgs decay to neutralino dark matter and examined its observability at the lhc by considering three production channels : the weak boson fusion @xmath2 , the associated production with a z - boson @xmath3 or a pair of top quarks @xmath4 .",
    "our findings are : ( i ) in the mssm such a decay is far below the detectable level ; ( ii ) in the nmssm it is accessible in a sizable part of parameter space ; ( iii ) in the nmssm it is detectable in a major part of the parameter space .",
    "( iv ) when this invisible decay is sizable , the visible di - photon decay is suppressed .",
    "so , we conclude that at the lhc the interplay of detecting such an invisible decay and the visible di - photon decay may allow for a discrimination of different susy models .",

    "<S> we find that in the mssm such a decay is far below the detectable level ; while in both the nmssm and nmssm the decay branching ratio can be large enough to be observable at the lhc . </S>",
