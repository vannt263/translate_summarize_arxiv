    "in recent literature there is increasing evidence that the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) is significant in the cuprate based high - temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) and it is argued that phonons might play an important role for the electron dynamics in the htsc s ; see , e.g. refs .",
    "it is known from the experiments for some time that the frequencies of the oxygen bond - stretching modes ( obsm ) are strongly renormalized ( softened ) upon doping in the @xmath3-doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "quite recently first evidence of an anomalous dispersion of the obsm also has been reported in a bi cuprate @xcite which , among other things , will be investigated theoretically in this work .",
    "anomalous softening of the obsm , not existing in the undoped insulating state , also has been observed in the @xmath4-doped metallic state of nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the phonon dispersion and the charge response in nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 have been calculated in @xcite and the result compares well with the measured anomalous dispersion .",
    "all these findings support a generic nature of the obsm phonon anomalies in the htsc s .",
    "the frequency renormalization and a corresponding increase of the linewidths point to a strong coupling of these phonons to the charge carriers .",
    "deviations from the presumably generic dispersion for the obsm in form of a sharp softening have recently been reported in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and high resolution inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) experiments , respectively , for la@xmath7ba@xmath8cuo@xmath1 at @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this has been related to the possibility of stripe formation in this compound .    according to our calculations the origin of the phonon anomalies is a strong _ nonlocal _ epi due to specific screening effects in form of a polarization created by metallic charge fluctuations ( cf s ) on the outer shells of the cu and o@xmath11 ions in the cuo plane ;",
    "see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this type of screening characteristic for a strongly inhomogeneous electronic system like the cuprates with a strong component of ionic binding and a corresponding density distribution which is mainly concentrated at the ions in the cuo plane leads for the @xmath3-doped cuprates @xcite and also for the @xmath4-doped nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite to an anomalous behaviour of the dispersion .",
    "the specific form of screening yields for the obsm in metallic la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 a _ downward _ dispersion of the anomalous longitudinal branch with high frequencies along the ( 1,0,0 ) and the ( 1,1,0 ) direction , respectively . in case of nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , however , the dispersion of the branches with high frequencies comprising the anomalous obsm is more complex than in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 because there are in contrast to la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 several branches of the same symmetry type nearby in energy leading to complex anticrossing phenomena @xcite . such a possibility is also investigated for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 in this work .",
    "the anomalous dispersion can not be understood within a typical lattice dynamical model , like the shell model , extended by a homogeneous electron gas screening that is _ diagonal _ in reciprocal space .",
    "this type of dielectric response always yields an _ increasing _ dispersion when passing from the center of the brillouin zone ( bz ) into the zone , because of an incomplete screening of the phonon - induced changes of the coulomb potential at shorter distances .",
    "in contrast , the anomalous softening of the obsm in particular of the oxygen half - breathing mode ( @xmath12 anomaly halfway the @xmath13 direction ) and the full oxygen breathing mode ( o@xmath14 at the @xmath15 point of the bz ) is a result of an `` overscreening '' of the phonon induced changes of the coulomb potential .",
    "the overscreening effect has been shown by our calculations to be due to nonlocally excited cf s localized at the cu and o@xmath11 sites in the cuo plane accompanied by ( dynamic ) charge ordering in form of localized stripes of alternating sign in the plane @xcite .",
    "expressed in terms of the density response matrix in reciprocal space such a strong nonlocal epi effect and `` overscreening '' of the obsm is related to the _ off - diagonal elements _ ( local field effect ) being apparently very important in the cuprates as revealed by the anomalous softening found in our studies .    in our calculations",
    "a sufficiently broad set of orbital degrees of freedom ( cu@xmath6 , cu@xmath5 , o@xmath16 ) , the full three dimensional long range coulomb interaction as well as the short range local repulsion of the electrons , especially the important on - site repulsion mediated by the localized cu@xmath6 orbital , is considered quantitatively .",
    "all the resulting couplings arising in the dynamical matrix are microscopically well defined and can be calculated .    from our investigations ,",
    "see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , we extract a strong epi for the phonon anomalies @xmath12 and o@xmath14 , which can well be treated in _",
    "adiabatic _ approximation .",
    "moreover , we find a very strong nonadiabatic enhancement of the coupling compared to the adiabatic case for phonon - like modes , like o@xmath17 ( axial oxygen breathing mode at the @xmath18 point of the bz ) , from a small _ nonadiabatic _ region around the @xmath19-axis . in this region",
    "poor dynamical screening due to the slow charge dynamics around the @xmath19-axis of the long range polar coulomb interaction of the ions leads in metallic lacuo@xmath1 to low - energy plasmons mixing with certain interlayer phonons of the same symmetry . for a discussion of phonon - plasmon mixing in the cuprates , see also @xcite .",
    "an essential nonlocal interaction of holes with @xmath19-axis polarized optical phonons in the htsc s has also been reported in @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that besides the more delocalized cu@xmath5 state the short range part of the coulomb interaction @xmath20 related to the localized cu@xmath6 orbital is particular important for the @xmath12 and o@xmath14 mode polarized and propagating in the cuo plane while the strong long range nonlocal polar coulomb interaction plays an important role for o@xmath17 and similar @xmath21 phonons polarized and propagating along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "thus , the relevance , of both , short range electron repulsion @xmath20 in the correlated cu@xmath6 state as well as long range polar coupling of the electrons to the phonons , is demonstrated by our calculations of the phonon anomalies in the cuprates . consequently , any quantitative study of the physics of the normal or superconducting state of the cuprates should consider electron correlations and strong nonlocal epi on an equal footing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the theory and modeling is shortly reviewed .",
    "section 3 presents the calculations for the phonon dynamics , charge response and the phonon density of states of hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 and a comparison with earlier calculations of lacuo@xmath1 and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the main focus is on the obsm phonon anomalies in the various materials and the effect of the charge response in the ionic layers on the dispersion .",
    "a summary of the paper is given in section 4 and the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in the following a brief survey of the theory and modeling is presented .",
    "a detailed description can be found in @xcite and in particular in @xcite where the calculation of the coupling parameters of the theory is presented .",
    "the local part of the electronic charge response and the epi is approximated in the spirit of the _ quasi - ion approach _",
    "@xcite by an ab initio rigid ion model ( rim ) taking into account covalent ion softening in terms of ( static ) effective ionic charges calculated from a tight - binding analysis .",
    "the tight - binding analysis supplies these charges as extracted from the orbital occupation numbers @xmath22 of the @xmath23 ( tight - binding ) orbital in question : @xmath24 @xmath25 stands for the @xmath23-component of the eigenvector of band @xmath4 at the wavevector @xmath26 in the first bz ; the summation in equation runs over all occupied states and @xmath27 gives the number of the elementary cells in the ( periodic ) crystal .",
    "in addition , scaling of the short range part of certain pair potentials between the ions is performed to simulate further covalence effects in the calculation in such a way that the energy - minimized structure is as close as possible to the experimental one @xcite .",
    "structure optimization and energy minimization is very important for a reliable calculation of the phonon dynamics through the dynamical matrix .",
    "taking just the experimental structure data as is done in many cases in the literature may lead to uncontrolled errors in the phonon calculations .",
    "the rim with the corrections just mentioned then serves as an unbiased reference system for the description of the htsc s and can be considered as a first approximation for the insulating state of these compounds because of the strong ionic nature of bonding in the cuprates .",
    "starting with such an unprejudiced rigid reference system non - rigid electronic polarization processes are introduced in form of more or less localized electronic charge - fluctuations ( cf s ) at the outer shells of the ions . especially in the metallic state of the htsc",
    "s the latter dominate the _",
    "nonlocal _ contribution of the electronic density response and the epi and are particularly important in the cuo planes .",
    "in addition , _ anisotropic _ dipole - fluctuations ( df s ) are admitted in our approach @xcite .",
    "they prove to be specifically of interest for the ions in the ionic layers mediating the dielectric coupling and for the polar modes .",
    "thus , the basic variable of our model is the ionic density which is given in the perturbed state by @xmath28 @xmath29 is the density of the unperturbed ion , as used in the rim , localized at the sublattice @xmath30 of the crystal and moving rigidly with the latter under displacement .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 describe the amplitudes and the form - factors of the cf s and the last term in equation represents the dipolar deformation of an ion @xmath30 with amplitude ( dipole moment ) @xmath33 and a radial density distribution @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the unit vector in the direction of @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath32 are approximated by a spherical average of the orbital densities of the ionic shells calculated in lda taking self - interaction effects ( sic ) into account .",
    "the dipole density @xmath37 is obtained from a modified sternheimer method in the framework of lda - sic @xcite .",
    "all sic - calculations are performed for the average spherical shell in the orbital - averaged form according to perdew and zunger @xcite . for the correlation part of the energy per electron",
    "the parametrization given in @xcite has been used .",
    "the total energy of the crystal is obtained by assuming that the density can be approximated by a superposition of overlapping densities @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath29 in equation are also calculated within lda - sic taking environment effects , via a watson sphere potential and the calculated static effective charges of the ions into account .",
    "the watson sphere method is only used for the oxygen ions and the depth of the watson sphere potential is set as the madelung potential at the corresponding site .",
    "such an approximation holds well in the htsc s @xcite .",
    "finally , applying the pair - potential approximation we get for the total energy : @xmath39 the energy @xmath40 depends on both the configuration of the ions @xmath41 and the electronic ( charge ) degrees of freedom ( edf ) @xmath42 of the charge density , i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 in equation .",

    "the phonon frequencies @xmath62 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath63 of the modes @xmath64 are obtained from the secular equation for the dynamical matrix in equation , i.e. @xmath65 the eqs . - are generally valid and , in particular , are independent of the specific model for the decomposition of the perturbed density in equation and the pair approximation in equation for the energy .",
    "the lenghty details of the calculation of the coupling coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 can not be reviewed in this paper .",
    "they are presented in @xcite . in this context",
    "we note that the coupling matrix @xmath66 of the edf - edf interaction , whose inverse appears in equation for the dynamical matrix , can be written in matrix notation as @xmath67 @xmath68 is the inverse of the _ proper polarization part _ of the density response matrix and contains the kinetic part to the interaction @xmath61 while @xmath69 embodies the hartree and exchange - correlation contribution , because they are related to the second functional derivatives with respect to the density @xmath70 of the kinetic energy and the exchange - correlation energy , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 needed for the dynamical matrix and the epi is closely related to the linear density response matrix and to the inverse dielectric matrix @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "only very few attempts have been made to calculate the phonon dispersion and the epi of the htsc s using the linear response method in form of density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) within lda @xcite .",
    "these calculations correspond to calculating @xmath73 and @xmath69 in dft - lda and for the _ metallic _ state only . on the other hand , in our microscopic modeling dft - lda - sic calculations",

    "other possible nonadiabatic contributions to @xmath61 related to dynamical exchange - correlation effects and the phonons themselves are beyond the scope of the present approach . using equation for the dielectric matrix , @xmath82 , and the frequency - dependent version of the irreducible polarization part , @xmath73 , according to equation , the free - plasmon dispersion is obtained from the condition , @xmath83 = 0 .\\ ] ] the coupled - mode frequencies of the phonons and the plasmons must be determined self - consistently from the secular equation for the dynamical matrix which now contains the frequency @xmath84 implicitly via @xmath73 in the response function @xmath71 .",

    "moreover , we have listed the corresponding frequencies in thz as calculated in the rim , the 11bm and the 12bm .",
    "it should be noted , that due to the simple tetragonal elementary cell , in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 the full breathing mode is located at @xmath85 and the half - breathing mode at @xmath15 , but to be consistent with the other three compounds we keep the denotation @xmath12 and o@xmath14 also for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .    a measure for the electron - phonon coupling strength is given by the mode- and orbital selective charge fluctuations @xmath86 from equation and the related renormalization of the corresponding phonon modes .",
    "we find a very strong renormalization of the mode frequencies by the electronic polarizations processes which nearly exclusively results from the nonlocally excited cf s @xmath87 listed in .",
    "the softening for o@xmath14 as compared to the rim is in the range between 4 thz and 5 thz and for @xmath12 between 2 thz and 4 thz .",
    "the largest softening for @xmath12 occurs in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 partly due to the fact that there is virtually no anticrossing with other modes of @xmath88 symmetry .",
    "the significant renormalization of the obsm in all the compounds investigated so far signals a strong nonlocal electron - phonon coupling in the cuprates .",
    "this strong coupling , in particular the effect of the cu@xmath5 orbital , can also be read off from the calculated magnitude of the phonon induced charge response given in in terms of the cf s @xmath86 according to equation .    our calculations for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 in the following ,",
    "are based on the @xmath73-model approach because unlike to la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 no reliable tight - binding parametrization of a first principles band structure is available for these compounds . even if a tight - binding parametrization of a typical dft - lda based band structure would exist it would be not sufficient to describe the dynamics of the @xmath21 modes in the htsc polarized and propagating along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "this is , because typical dft - lda calculations are much too isotropic and underestimate the anisotropy of the real materials by far . for a detailed discussion of this interesting topic in case of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and its relevance for the nonadiabatic charge response and the related phonon - plasmon mixing , see refs .",
    "a short comment should be made concerning the size of the electron - phonon coupling strength of the adiabatic obsm with amplitudes within the plane ( @xmath12 , o@xmath89 ) compared to modes with out of plane amplitudes as the nonadiabatic apex oxygen bond - stretching mode o@xmath90 .",
    "like in the present paper in our calculations for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite an already strong coupling of the adiabatic modes @xmath12 and o@xmath14 has been found .",
    "however , for the nonadiabatic o@xmath90 mode with out of plane amplitudes we obtain in addition a very strong increase of the coupling as compared to the adiabatic in plane modes .",
    "phonon - plasmon mixing in the nonadiabatic region around the @xmath19-axis provides an extra channel for the formation of cooper pairs . for a suitable strength of interlayer coupling it becomes possible to achieve large contributions to the coupling from both , the phonon - like and the plasmon - like modes , as discussed in @xcite . assuming , that the phonon - plasmon contribution to pairing is significant this finding could help in the search of new high-@xmath91 materials .",

    "one notices that for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 only one phonon peak has been fitted in the energy range shown in ( a ) . on the other hand , we find in this range of energy a phonon spectrum which is much more complex comprising up to four @xmath88 modes , see . in the fit for bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2",
    "@xcite only two phonon peaks have been fitted in the range of energy shown in ( b ) , while according to our calculations in there are up to five @xmath88 modes in this range which can interact with each other and constitute a highly nontrivial anticrossing scenarium .",
    "quite general we can say that the ixs - spectra reveal for small @xmath50 values @xmath122 in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 one and in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 two marked peaks .",
    "however , the strength of the peaks strongly decreases for larger @xmath50 values such that at @xmath123 the peaks are very weak and an unique interpretation seems not possible .",
    "moreover , the dips in the phonon dispersion curves as extracted from the interpretation of the ixs - spectra at @xmath124 for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite and at @xmath125 for bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 @xcite are not found in our calculations .",
    "however , as a result of the complex anticrossing scenario we obtain a pronounced dip at @xmath126 in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 and two half - breathing modes below the dip with somewhat smaller frequencies , see .",
    "the higher one has a displacement pattern as shown in ( d ) and in the lower one the apex oxygen and the oxygens in the ionic layer vibrate with opposite phases compared to ( d ) .",
    "this holds also true for the @xmath15-point , where two breathing modes occur , see . the higher one has the displacement pattern as shown in ( d ) , and in the lower one the apex oxygen and the bismuth ion vibrate with opposite phases compared to ( d ) .    in case of hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1",
    "we do not find a pronounced dip for the @xmath88 modes in the relevant range of energy .",
    "we obtain as a result of four interacting @xmath88 modes two branches with the highest frequencies showing a downward dispersion from @xmath127 to @xmath15 while the anomalous half - breathing mode is found at a lower energy and turns out to be the end point of the @xmath88 branch with the third highest frequency .",
    "similar as in the case of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 we find in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 two breathing modes at the @xmath85 point .",
    "the lower one has a displacement pattern where the apex oxygen vibrates in opposite direction as compared to the higher frequency breathing mode displayed in figure ( c ) .",
    "so , we guess from our calculations for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 that the dip in the interpretation of the ixs - spectra may be an artefact of the complex anticrossing behaviour of several @xmath88 modes in the frequency range under consideration . however , we admit concerning our results , that our microscopic model for the electronic polarizability applied to the calculation of the phonon dynamics of hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 is not fully ab initio .",
    "the reliability of our calculated phonon dispersion may be judged from the conformance of our results with the phonon branches in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 at lower frequencies measured so far and displayed in for the model @xmath73 - 3dim .",
    "the experimental and calculated results for the raman and infrared active modes @xcite are listed in for both compounds and a good agreement is found for the measured and the calculated data in model @xmath73 - 3dim .",
    "this fact together with the good results in model @xmath73 - 3dim for the dispersion underlines the importance of the electronic polarization processes of certain ions in the ionic layers and in general of the physics of the third dimension perpendicular to the cuo plane .",
    "-2dim ( ) and model @xmath73 - 3dim ( ) .",
    "the three leftmost panels belong to hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and the five rightmost panels belong to bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 .",
    "only irreducible representations with a different phonon dispersion in model @xmath73 - 2dim and model @xmath73 - 3dim are shown .",
    "the arrangement of the panels from left to right according to the different irreducible representations is as follows : @xmath128 . ]",
    "the effect introduced by the cf s on the o@xmath97 , hg and bi ions outside of the cuo plane on the phonon dispersion by itself is demonstrated in for both compounds by comparing the results of model @xmath73 - 2dim ( broken lines ) with those of model @xmath73 - 3dim ( full lines ) . only the branches are shown where large differences appear .",
    "the most significant renormalization of the dispersion emerges for the modes with the highest frequencies .",
    "bacuo@xmath1 and ( b ) bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 for model @xmath73 - 3dim ( ) . for comparison , the dos of the rim is shown as dotted line ( ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath129 and @xmath130 in ( a ) show the experimental data @xcite at 30 and 300k , respectively , the symbols @xmath130 in ( b ) represent the experimental data @xcite at 300k .",
    "all experimental data are in arbitrary units and shifted for better viewing . ]    finally , in , the calculated phonon density of states ( dos ) is shown for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 , respectively , and is compared with the experimental findings for both compounds .",
    "the theoretical results have been obtained with model @xmath73 - 3dim .",
    "they compare quite well with the experimental results for both , the width of the spectra and their peak structure .",
    "of course the assignment of the peaks is difficult in detail because the experimental data are broadened .",
    "a calculation of the partial phonon density of states , not shown in this work , demonstrates that the dos in the lower frequency range is dominated by cu- , ba- , hg - vibrations and by cu- , bi- , sr - vibrations , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - frequency part of the spectrum is nearly exclusively governed by the oxygen modes .    from ( a ) and ( b ) also the difference of the dos in the model @xmath73 - 3dim and the rim generated by the electronic polarization processes can be extracted . from the calculated results we find a significant decrease of the width of the spectra together with a characteristic redistribution of spectral weight particularly in the high - frequency part .",
    "the latter is dominated by strongly coupling high - frequency oxgen vibrations living in this part of the spectra and suffering a corresponding softening compared to the rim .",
    "the pronounced peaks which are generated by this softening also mean that there is considerable phase space for this strongly coupling modes .",
    "we have shown that for a reliable description of phonon dynamics and charge response in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 a broad set of orbital degrees of freedom ( cu@xmath6 , cu@xmath5 , o@xmath16 ) must be taken into account to model the electronic structure of the cuo plane . moreover , for an ample representation of the real three - dimensional compounds electronic degrees of freedom beyond the strictly two - dimensional electronic structure must be considered .",
    "we found that in the link between the cuo plane and the ionic layers of the cuprates electronic polarization processes of cf type are essential at certain ions . in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 o@xmath131 and hg@xmath132 cf s and",
    "in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 o@xmath131 and bi@xmath133 cf s , respectively , are significant processes .",
    "cf s on these ions are promoted by the short distance of the o@xmath97-hg and o@xmath97-bi bond .",
    "allowance of cf s on these ions outside of the cuo plane ( model @xmath73 - 3dim ) leads to a much better depiction of the phonon dispersion curves , the raman active and the infrared active modes , in particular for those where the apex oxygen vibrates along its bond with the hg or the bi ion , respectively .",
    "as far as the electronic degrees of freedom in the cuo plane are concerned we have pointed out that besides the localized cu@xmath6 state and the o@xmath16 state also the more delocalized cu@xmath5 state is needed in the charge response for an adequate representation of the large softening of the high - frequency oxygen bond - stretching modes and the strong coupling to the electrons .",
    "such an effect also has been found in our previous calculations for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the strong nonlocal coupling and the related strong renormalization of these modes seems to be generic in the cuprates .    altogether , our calculated results for model @xmath73 - 3dim are partly in good agreement with the phonon dispersion measured so far in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 and also with the raman active and infrared active modes .",
    "however , we have pointed out that an interpretation of the ixs measurements of hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 in the high - frequency part of the spectrum and the assignment of dips in the corresponding phonon dispersion curves can not be supported by our calculations .",
    "this is , because our investigations exhibit that in the frequency range under study we have multiple interacting phonon modes of @xmath88 symmetry ( four in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and five in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath2 ) which create a complex anticrossing scenario that possibly can not be studied correctly within a fit using just one or two modes .",
    "finally , we have calculated the dos of both compounds in satisfactory agreement with experiment .",
    "we found a significant redistribution of spectral weight due to the electronic polarization processes in particular in the high - frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "this energy range is dominated by the strongly coupling oxygen modes signaling a considerable amount of phase space for strong electron phonon coupling .",
