    "the persistence length of dsdna has been estimated to be 45 - 50 nm by various methods@xcite , and shown to be largely independent of monovalent salt concentration above 20 mm@xcite .",
    "strong bending of dsdna , which refers to deflection of larger than @xmath1 between adjacent base pairs ( or equivalently , one turn per persistence length ) , occurs in transcriptional repression@xcite , nucleosome formation@xcite , and viral dna packaging@xcite .",

    "the meltable or kinkable wlc model could correctly predict the measured j factors , but the parameters used are not supported by experimental data@xcite .",
    "du et al . later pointed out that the ligase concentration used in the first study by the widom group was too high to correctly estimate the j factor@xcite .",
    "they measured the bimolecular rate constant of dimerization in a separate ligation reaction using low ligase concentration , and showed that the measured j factor is in agreement with the wlc model . the other experimental studies that reported high j factors used afm on surface - confined dna and tethered particle motion on protein - mediated dna looping .",

    "the results from this study suggest a significant departure of dsdna from either the wlc model or 45 - 50-nm persistence length",
    ". however , other experimental factors could have led to an overestimation of the j factor : ( 1 ) using synthetic oligos may introduce mismatched base pairs@xcite , ( 2 ) high salt conditions ( 1 m sodium or 10 mm magnesium ) can increase dna curvature and flexibility@xcite and/or ( 3 ) long sticky ends used in the experiment can increase the apparent looping probability@xcite .",
    "( 1 ) can be addressed by using pcr - based dna assembly@xcite , but ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can not be easily addressed because lowering salt concentration or shortening the sticky ends severely reduce the frequency of looping events observable by fret for short dna molecules .",

    "the key idea is that stability of end - to - end annealed dna loops is highly sensitive to loop size due to internal bending stress as depicted in fig .",

    "since different dna models make different predictions about how this shear force depends on the loop length , we can experimentally test these models by measuring linker lifetime vs. loop size .",
    "our unlooping - based approach has unique capabilities that complement the ligation - based or fret - based j factor measurements : ( 1 ) unlooping rates can be measured with good statistics in moderate salt conditions where looping of short dsdna rarely occurs ; ( 2 ) only the molecules that were able to loop are followed in the loop breakage assay , which automatically filters out dysfunctional molecules ; and ( 3 ) the unlooping rate is related to the shear force , which is easier to compute than the j factor .    using this unlooping assay , we measured the lifetime of small dna loops as a function of loop size in the strong bending regime .",
    "we found that the loop lifetime decreases with decreasing loop size , indicative of increasing bending stress .",
    "the bending stress , however , ceased to increase elastically below a critical loop size , reminiscent of a structural transition in dsdna , such as kink formation .",
    "based on this apparent transition , we estimate the free energy of kink formation to be larger than @xmath2 .",
    "we also found that this energy cost was significantly lowered by magnesium to @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig3](a , b ) ) agrees well with the wlc model prediction , but not with lsec .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath9 was previously measured to be 1  per base pair by pulling short dna duplexes at opposite @xmath16-ends@xcite . in our stretched linker duplex ,",
    "the total number of complementary base pairs is 13 , but the largest number of consecutive base pairs is 9 due to cy5 in the backbone .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 can be estimated to be in the range of 0.9 nm to 1.3 nm , which includes the prediction of the wlc model but not the lsec model . since both parameters @xmath9 and @xmath13 are compatible with the wlc model , but",
    "not with the lsec model , we conclude that the free energy of dsdna loop as small as 60 bp is better described by the wlc model .",
    "to confirm that our conclusion is not affected by duplex dissociation kinetics , we conducted the unlooping assay at different [ na^+^ ] concentrations . in the range between 50 and 200 mm [ na^+^ ]",
    ", @xmath13 is expected to increase with [ na^+^]@xcite whereas the persistence length of dsdna should not depend on [ na^+^ ] .",
    "as expected , the linker lifetime @xmath13 was significantly prolonged at higher salt concentrations ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ) . despite changes in loop lifetimes as a function of [ na^+^ ] , all curves exhibit a softening transition near 60 bp , and all @xmath13 values ( marked ` @xmath15 ' in fig .",

    "the observed relationships at different [ na^+^ ] also collapsed to the same line when normalized by @xmath13 ( supplementary fig .",
    "[ sfig7 ] ) .",
    "this result further supports our conclusion that the wlc model correctly describes the free energy of dsdna bending prior to the softening transition .",
    "we also investigated how magnesium affects strong bending of dsdna .",
    "magnesium is essential for the activity of the ligase in the cyclization assay , and the restriction enzyme in dna minicircle digestion .",
    "therefore , almost all enzyme - based experiments on strong dsdna bending have been performed in the presence of magnesium at relatively high concentrations ( 5 - 10 mm ) .",
    "interestingly , we found that in the presence of 5 mm [ mg^2+^ ] , the softening transition of dsdna occurs near 100 bp ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and supplementary fig .",
    "[ sfig8 ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that magnesium can dramatically increase the apparent flexibility of dsdna in the strong bending regime .",
    "using a fret - based unlooping assay , we probed the energetics of dsdna bending in the strong bending regime .",
    "we measured the loop lifetime as a function of loop size . in standard na^+^ concentrations between 50 and 200 mm , the observed relationship in the range between 60 and 200 bp was consistent with the wlc model .",
    "below 60 bp , we observed that dsdna loses elastic rigidity , which leads to a weaker dependence of the shear force on the loop size .",
    "the critical loop size where softening occurs corresponds to a maximum bending angle of @xmath17/bp in a teardrop shape . in the presence of 5 mm [ mg^2+^ ] ,",
    "the critical loop size increased to 100 bp , corresponding to @xmath18/bp .",
    "this result suggests that in cyclization experiments that typically use 10 mm [ mg^2+^ ] , subelastic bending can enhance the looping probability of dsdna shorter than 100 bp .",
    "the interpretation of our results relies on the bell relationship between duplex lifetime and stretching force@xcite . in general",
    ", a bond can dissociate through several different pathways@xcite , which may give rise to a nontrivial relationship between bond lifetime and the applied force@xcite .",
    "however , our assumption of the bell model is justified by previous experimental studies@xcite .",
    "notably , a dna duplex pulled at the opposite @xmath16-ends by afm , in the same shear geometry as in our dna loop , exhibited strand separation kinetics consistent with a single energy barrier along the mechanical separation path .",
    "also , the chemla group recently demonstrated that dna duplex dissociation under a constant tensile force follows the bell relationship by combining fluorescence with optical tweezers@xcite . in that study ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath9 and duplex length ( @xmath19 ) was extracted to be @xmath20 ( nm ) , and has been more precisely determined as @xmath21 ( nm ) ( personal communication with dr .",
    "either estimation puts @xmath9 to be in the range consistent with the wlc model but not with the lsec model .",
    "the breakdown of continuous models below the critical loop size is likely due to structural transition in the dsdna helix such as kink formation@xcite that renders dna softer .",
    "for free dna , kinks are rare , transient deformations only occurring at a rate of @xmath22@xcite , but they can become significant in sharply bent dna@xcite . we can use the apparent critical loop size to set the lower limit on the energy barrier for kink formation . to account for the effect of kinking on loop stability , we consider the kinkable worm - like chain ( kwlc ) model@xcite cast in a simple functional form proposed by vologodskii and frank - kamenetskii@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the dinucleotide bending energy ( @xmath23 ) is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the bending rigidity identical to that of the wlc model , @xmath26 is the energy barrier of kinking , and @xmath27 specifies the range of bending angles at the kink .",
    "we varied @xmath26 while fixing @xmath27 in our simulation to find @xmath26 that is most compatible with the observed critical length of 60 bp .",
    "the parameter b was chosen to be 0.3 which allows kink angles up to @xmath28@xcite based on other calculations and molecular dynamics simulations@xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can produce a transition in the shear force below 60 bp , which is consistent with our observation . using this @xmath26 value",
    ", we can also calculate the free energy of kink formation ( @xmath31 ) ( more details in the supplementary information ) to be @xmath32 , which is similar to the upper limits of previous estimations@xcite . in comparison to @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the kwlc model ,",
    "the lifetime vs. loop size relationship taken at 5 mm [ mg^2+^ ] yields @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these parameters correspond to a lower free energy of kink formation of @xmath35 and larger kink angles up to @xmath36 .    using the parameters , h and b , constrained by our data , we can also determine the probability of kink formation in a dna minicircle as a function of loop size .",
    "we performed a restrained mc simulation of dna minicircles of various sizes ( see methods ) to measure the frequency of large angle deflections in thermal equilibrium . in our simulation , we only consider the effect of bending stress on kink formation .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ sfig10 ] , in the absence of magnesium , kink formation is negligible even in 60-bp loops due to a high energy barrier . in the presence of 5 mm [ mg^2+^ ] , however , the kinking probability increases sharply with decreasing loop size , approaching unity at 70 bp while remains insignificant for dna over 100 bp .",
    "this simulation result agrees well with a previous minicircle digestion study that detected kinks in 60-bp minicircles due to bending stress alone@xcite .    *",
    "j factor comparison*. the j factor was computed using a fixed end - to - end distance of 5 nm without end - to - end angular or torsional constraints .",
    "we used the weighted histogram analysis method to calculate j factors predicted by the wlc model ( black circles ) , the kwlc model with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( red triangles ) , and with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( blue squares ) .",

    "for consistency with our calculation , we shifted the original data@xcite by 10 bp to the left to account for the linker length .",
    "the arrows indicate where the kwlc model deviates from the wlc model .",
    "we performed 4 simulations to generate the sem error bars for each j factor . ]",
    "our results suggest that magnesium can promote subelastic bending above a critical bending angle of @xmath18/bp by stabilizing large - angle deformations .",
    "this interpretation is similar to the conclusion of a recent study with dna vises@xcite .",
    "therefore , we considered whether magnesium - facilitated softening could explain high j factors reported previously@xcite .",
    "we thus calculated the j factor as a function of length using the kwlc model with @xmath42 and @xmath43 constrained by the data taken at 5 mm [ mg^2+^ ] .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , while the kwlc model produces j factors similar to the wlc model prediction above 100 bp as previously demonstrated@xcite , it also predicts substantially higher j factors for dna below 100 bp , matching the j factors determined from the single - molecule fret cyclization study@xcite within a factor of 10 .",
    "the agreement between our kwlc model and the result of the fret study may be closer if the difference in the buffer condition ( 5 mm vs. 10 mm [ mg^2+^ ] ) and the uncertainty associated with j factor determination is accounted for ( supplementary information ) . in the absence of magnesium",
    ", however , our kwlc model predicts that the wlc model will be valid at least down to 55 bp ( blue squares , fig .",

    ", we demonstrated that effects of small amounts of monovalent and divalent ions on the elastic limit of dsdna can be studied separately .",
