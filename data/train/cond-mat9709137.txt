    "= 0.44 -5.50 cm    zhang@xcite has proposed that the physics of doping the cuprate superconductors is controlled by an @xmath2 transformation group , having a 5-dimensional superspin representation which mixes spin - density wave ( sdw ) and d - wave superconducting components .",
    "this is in contradiction to earlier findings@xcite that in the hubbard model at half filling d - wave superconductivity is symmetry - equivalent to a flux phase@xcite . here",
    ", we show that zhang s @xmath2 group is a subgroup of an @xmath1 group , the instability group of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) van hove singularity ( vhs)@xcite . the corresponding 6-component superspin combines zhang s superspin with a flux - phase instability .",
    "consider an electronic state with a two - fold orbital degeneracy , @xmath3 . including spin and charge conjugation ,    = 0.35 -4.5 cm = 0.35 -1.6 cm",
    "8 single particle operators can be formed , or @xmath4 pair operators ( taking account of the pauli exclusion principle ) .",
    "these operators can be combined into a representation of an @xmath5 group , the pair group@xcite which controls the various pairing and nesting instabilities which can arise . for the quasi-2d cuprates ,",
    "the orbital degeneracy is associated with the vhs s along @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; because of the large density of states ( dos ) at a vhs , the fermi surface can be approximated by just two points@xcite , similar to a one - dimensional metal .",
    "consider a supercell of size @xmath8 , each cell containing four atoms .",
    "let @xmath9 be a lattice vector of the original lattice , and @xmath10 be a lattice vector of the supercell lattice .",
    "if the cu - site operators are @xmath11 s , then the vhs operators are @xmath12 ( the remaining operators are located in other parts of the brillouin zone , and play a negligible role in nesting phenomena . )    a special role is played by the operator @xmath13 , which splits the vhs degeneracy .",
    "the operators which commute with @xmath14 form an @xmath1 transformation group , fig .",
    "1 , with two fundamental 6-dimensional representations , fig .",
    "the momentum - space representation of the superspin operators is shown in table i ; the full list is in ref . @xcite . since the generators of @xmath1 can be represented as antisymmetric @xmath15 matrices , fig .",
    "1 assigns each operator to the position of the corresponding non - zero matrix element , to produce the correct @xmath1 lie algebra @xmath16=i(\\delta_{ik}l^{jm}+\\delta_{jm}l^{ik}-\\delta_{im}l^{jk}- \\delta_{jk}l^{im } ) .",
    "\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] note that by deleting the second row and column , an @xmath2 subalgebra is generated , which is equivalent to the one postulated by zhang@xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 , the pseudospin operator@xcite is @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the superspin @xmath19 consists of a spin - density wave spin triplet ( @xmath20 ) and a pseudospin triplet combining d - wave superconductivity ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and an orbital antiferromagnet ( @xmath23 ) equivalent to the flux phase operator@xcite .",
    "the superspin @xmath24 consists of a spin current spin triplet ( @xmath25 ) and a charge - density wave ( @xmath26 ) , s - wave superconductivity ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) pseudospin triplet .",
    "these operators are equivalent to those introduced by schulz@xcite and , in a related context , by halperin and rice@xcite . 0.2 in     operator & representation + @xmath26 & @xmath29 + @xmath30 & @xmath31 + @xmath27 & @xmath32 + @xmath23 & @xmath33 + @xmath34 & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & @xmath37 +    0.2 in    in weak coupling ,",
    "the instabilities are controlled by their respective susceptibilities and the form of the quartic interaction terms . for an energy dispersion @xmath38",
    "then when @xmath39 and at exactly half filling ( square fermi surface ) , the model has an extra pseudospin symmetry@xcite , and all the bare susceptibilities are equal@xcite .",
    "the dressed susceptibilities are @xmath40 where @xmath41 is related to the quartic coupling .",
    "since all 12 @xmath42 s are equal ( at half filling ) , the ground state instability is controlled by the interactions @xmath41 . for a pure hubbard model ,",
    "the @xmath43 term breaks the @xmath1 symmetry , leading to a negative @xmath44 and a positive @xmath45 , @xmath46 , fig .",
    "thus at half filling the ground state is antiferromagnetic , @xmath47 .",
    "= 0.50 -6.5 cm    doping away from half filling breaks the pseudospin symmetry , leading to two distinct susceptibilities , @xmath48 for the particle - hole operators and @xmath49 for the particle - particle operators , fig .",
    "4 . since the susceptibilities are enhanced by nesting , their magnitudes fall off with doping .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath48 falls much more rapidly , leading to a possible scenario for d - wave superconductivity , fig .",
    "3@xcite : if there is an attractive interaction for d - wave superconductivity , it will be overwhelmed by the strong divergence in @xmath50 at half filling , but with doping , the sdw instability falls off much faster , leading to a possible crossover to d - wave superconductivity .",
    "this is consistent with earlier renormalization group results@xcite .    in a more realistic , strong coupling model",
    ", a number of additional features must be considered .",
    "first , additional hopping parameters , such as the second - neighbor @xmath51 term in eq .  [ eq:24 ] , also break the pseudospin degeneracy , fig .",
    "5 . note that the susceptibility diverges away from half filling , at the vhs , but even at optimal doping @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , by comparing fig .",
    "4 it can be seen that @xmath49 is actually larger , at optimal doping , for @xmath53 .",
    "since strong coupling pins the fermi level near the vhs over an extended doping range@xcite , this enhancement of @xmath49 can greatly enhance the possibility for d - wave superconductivity to arise on doping .",
    "there is considerable evidence for phonon coupling and structural instabilities in the doped material@xcite .",
    "hence , it is interesting to see whether strong electron - phonon coupling can cause a crossover to a groundstate involving * v@xmath54*. since the cdw operator is proportional to the difference in hole population of the odd and even sublattices , it must vanish in the strong coupling limit at    = 0.33 0.5 cm    = 0.33 0.5 cm    half filling , when there is one hole per cu . for finite doping there can be a cdw order , with @xmath55 , if all the holes are confined to one sublattice .",
    "the resulting structure is equivalent to that found in la@xmath56sr@xmath57nio@xmath58 for @xmath59@xcite .",
    "moreover , such a structure is closely related to the holon condensate@xcite introduced to overcome parity - violation problems in anyonic models of superconductivity . in these models ,",
    "two species of holons are introduced , of opposite parity violation . a coherent superposition of the two preserves parity , while producing a _ holon condensation _ , wherein all holons are confined to one sublattice , leading to a real - space cdw@xcite .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe a slave boson calculation@xcite which self - consistently takes into account both strong coupling effects and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we show that vhs pinning can provide a natural explanation for the observed stripe phases@xcite in these materials , as well as pseudogaps and extended vhs s .",
    "in the strong coupling limit , the dominant physics is quite different . at exactly half filling , there is a metal - insulator transition that is unrelated to nesting : a mott transition , or charge transfer insulator transition in the three - band model of the cuprates which will be employed here .",
    "the nesting / pairing instabilities arise on top of this transition , and are strongly constrained by the large hubbard @xmath43 , which limits double occupancy of the cu orbitals . in the slave boson approach employed here , the limit @xmath60 is taken ( no double occupancy ) . to include spin effects",
    ", it is necessary to go beyond the standard slave boson approach , either by introducing four slave bosons@xcite or by introducing a heisenberg exchange @xmath61@xcite  the latter approach is followed here .",
    "thus , the starting point of the analysis is the three - band model hamiltonian : @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\sum_{\\hat\\delta^{\\prime}}t_{oo}[p^{\\dagger}_{j+\\hat\\delta,\\sigma}p_{j+ \\hat\\delta^{\\prime},\\sigma}+(c.c . ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ + j\\sum_{\\hat\\delta^{\\prime\\prime},\\sigma^{\\prime } } d^{\\dagger}_{j,\\sigma}d_{j,\\sigma^{\\prime } } d^{\\dagger}_{j+\\hat\\delta , \\sigma^{\\prime}}d_{j+\\hat\\delta , \\sigma } \\bigr ) . \\label{eq:1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is a creation operator for holes on cu ( o ) , j is summed over lattice sites , @xmath65 over cu - o nearest neighbors , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) over o - o ( cu - cu ) neighbors , and c.c .",
    "stands for complex conjugate .",
    "the band parameters are @xmath68 , the splitting between the cu and o energy levels , @xmath69 , the cu - o hopping parameter , @xmath70 , the o - o hopping parameter , and @xmath61 the exchange constant .    in the above equation ,",
    "the limit @xmath71 has been taken , and a slave boson introduced to prevent cu double occupancy .",
    "the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath68 are renormalized values , to be solved self - consistently@xcite . in the exchange energy ,",
    "the @xmath72-term is decoupled in mean - field as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of unit cells and @xmath75 depending on the choice of phase , a variety of magnetic states are possible . here",
    "the only choices considered are @xmath76 , corresponding to a uniform phase ( only short - range magnetic correlations ) , and @xmath77 for a flux@xcite phase , with the @xmath78 sign chosen so that the net phase change around any plaquette is @xmath79 .",
    "finally , electron - phonon coupling is included by the substitution @xmath80 , with @xmath81 due to a cdw distortion : for a breathing mode , all four cu - o bonds are equivalent for any given cu , but all are long ( @xmath82 ) for one sublattice , and short for the other .",
    "note that this model includes only two of the twelve possible superspin components , but already gives rise to a complicated phase diagram .",
    "it should describe the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) crossover .",
    "a charge transfer insulator transition is found at half filling when @xmath68 exceeds a critical value@xcite .",
    "near half filling , the flux phase is stable , and the cdw is suppressed by strong coupling effects .",
    "however , if the electron - phonon coupling is strong enough , there is a crossover in the doped material to a cdw phase , which is maximally stable near the doping at which the fermi level crosses the bare vhs .",
    "as had been previously noted@xcite , the flux phase provides a good description of the measured energy dispersion in insulating cuprates@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , while the cdw fits the dispersion near optimum doping@xcite , in particular reproducing the extended vhs .",
    "[ note however that the present calculations underestimate the total dispersion by a factor of @xmath852 . ]",
    "the situation for intermediate dopings is more complex .",
    "the free energy minimum at finite doping associated with the cdw leads to an instability toward phase separation between magnetic ( flux phase ) and charged ( cdw ) domains .",
    "there is considerable experimental evidence for such phase separation in the cuprates@xcite , which can be macroscopic if the doping counterions are mobile ( e.g. , the interstitial oxygen in la@xmath86cuo@xmath87@xcite .",
    "more commonly , coulomb repulsion between holes restricts the phase separation to a nanoscopic scale@xcite , typically forming striped phases@xcite .",
    "the driving mechanism for this phase separation has variously been ascribed to large @xmath61@xcite , to the nearest neighbor coulomb energy @xmath88@xcite , or , as in the present case , to vhs - induced cdw formation@xcite .    in modeling the striped phase ,",
    "a static stripe pattern produces too much structure in the dispersion , due to minigaps@xcite .",
    "if a fluctuating striped phase is approximated by taking the weighted average of the end - phase band parameters , good agreement with the experimental dispersion is found , fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . in this figure @xmath89 is the fraction of charged stripes , with @xmath90 the doping of the uniformly doped charged end phase , here taken as @xmath91 .",
    "the same model also describes the crossover from small ( hole pockets ) to large fermi surface with doping , fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] .      a number of points should be made .",
    "( 1 ) the splitting of the bands near the @xmath92-point , @xmath6 , provides a good descrpition of pseudogap formation in the cuprates  not only the photoemission data , fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , but also thermodynamic data from heat capacity and magnetization@xcite , as well as the temperature - doping phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the smooth doping dependence masks a crossover from spin - like to charge - like instability  from @xmath83 .",
    "accordingly , the underdoped results near half filling are in good agreement with recent monte carlo calculations@xcite . ( 2 ) from fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b , it is clear that the pseudogap is directly associated with the splitting of the vhs degeneracy , and hence with the properties of @xmath1 . ( 3 ) campuzano@xcite reports a different doping dependence of the @xmath6 photoemission , namely that there are two independent features , one a sharp quasiparticle peak which is near the fermi level at optimal doping , and broadens severely in underdoped samples , and the second a broad peak which is already present at @xmath93200mev below the fermi level in optimally doped material , and gradually shifts to 300mev with increased underdoping .",
    "a dynamic fluctuation model can accomodate this in terms of a dynamic average of the two end phases .",
    "( 4 ) there is considerable evidence for short - range cdw order in the doped cuprates , summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , section 9.2 , often associated with cuo bond stretching@xcite .",
    "( 5 ) in the present model , the pseudogap is associated with magnetic or structural instabilities which compete with superconductivity .",
    "hence , there should be a separate superconducting gap , which scales with @xmath94 and @xmath95@xcite .",
    "this gap may be related to the spin gap and resonance peak seen in neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic susceptibility near @xmath96@xcite .",
    "( 6 ) in the overdoped regime , the cdw undergoes a quantum phase transition , @xmath97 .",
    "it has been suggested that such a qcp can lead to high - t@xmath0 superconductivity@xcite .",
