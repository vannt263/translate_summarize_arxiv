    "the development of new laser sources and experimental techniques has made possible the control and deeper understanding of the electron motion in atoms and nuclei in molecules .",
    "the determination of the molecular structure has been a challenge for decades , and now it is accessible to experimental investigations on the atto- , femto- and picosecond time scales by x - ray  @xcite and electron diffraction  @xcite , high harmonic generation  @xcite , photo - ionization  @xcite and coulomb explosion  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the addition of external electric and magnetic fields allows the control of stereo chemical properties of linear and polyatomic molecules .",
    "in particular , the control of translational dynamics  @xcite , orientation and alignment in the laboratory  @xcite and state  @xcite or conformers  @xcite selection have been realized .",
    "recently , many efforts have focused on the transformation between isomers using a combination of non - resonant laser pulses , in particular for molecules formed by two planar groups linked by a bond  @xcite . in such molecules a long nanosecond pulse",
    "is used to align the main axis of the molecular polarizability tensor either along a given direction or in a plane of the laboratory system .",
    "then , a short picosecond laser pulse or train of pulses interact efficiently with the fixed molecule , kicking the planar groups to or against the coplanar configuration .",
    "theoretically , the description of this process has been tackled using a 2d model , which considers that the molecule is perfectly aligned by the long laser pulse , and the kick pulse only affects the internal rotation and torsion@xcite .",
    "the 1d model is a more restrictive approximation which considers only the torsion degrees of freedom  @xcite . in a strong field",
    ", it is in principle possible to design an appropriate laser pulse capable of transferring the whole population to a desired enantiomer  ( optical isomer )  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies of the torsional and overall rotation have been carried out for biphenyl - like molecules , which together with ethylene , has been used as prototypes to highlight the motion in non - rigid molecules  @xcite .",
    "we use the term biphenyl - like to describe a molecule formed by two identical rings linked by a bond , whose paradigmatic case is biphenyl .",
    "the rings can rotate with respect to each other , giving rise to the torsion .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that the interaction with an intense laser pulse has strong implications on the alignment and the torsional dynamics between the two groups  @xcite .",
    "if the laser is strong enough , it is possible to change the internal configuration of the molecule , e.g. , to change the chirality in the case of axially chiral molecules .",
    "however , this effect is purely theoretical , since the intensities required would lead to ionization or breaking of the molecule before such a transition would occur . in practice ,",
    "the torsional barrier is much higher than the energy associated with the laser interaction and its impact therefore leads to relatively small fluctuations in the torsional angle  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate theoretically the connection between the torsional and rotational motion in a biphenyl - like molecule by enabling the torsional relaxation of the rings . by means of a resonant laser we induce a transition between two electronic states  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the phenyl rings feel a different potential in the final electronic state , inducing their internal torsion .",
    "this change in the dynamics leads to a modification of the rotational parameters of the molecule , which depend on the relative position of the rings , and subsequently , initiate the rotational dynamics that may be reflected in an improvement of the alignment of the molecule in the laboratory .",
    "the rotational dynamics is understood in terms of the total angular momentum of the entire molecule @xmath0 and its projection along the @xmath1  axis of the molecular fixed frame ( mff ) @xmath2 .",
    "the change of @xmath3 in time means that the molecule undergoes changes in the rotation around the @xmath1 axis of the mff which leads to variations on its orientation in space , similar to the classical precession or nutation .",

    "to induce rotation by means of the torsion in the biphenyl - like molecule  [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ] , we have to induce a large torsional motion .",
    "experimentally , the torsional motion can be initiated using non - resonant lasers .",
    "a long ns pulse is used to align the molecule , and then a short ps pulse kicks the planar groups , causing the torsional dynamics .",
    "the measurements , however , show that this procedure leads to oscillations in the dihedral angle [ @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ] only a few degrees from the equilibrium position  @xcite . theoretical studies using a single laser lead to the same conclusion  @xcite .",
    "we propose a different scenario , consisting of changing the torsional potential of the molecule by means of an electronic excitation .",
    "we select two designed torsional potentials to provoke different torsional dynamics , covering the behavior induced by a coplanar and a perpendicular relative orientation of the phenyl rings . depending on the electronic state , the torsional wavepacket propagates in different regions , allowing us to explore several configurations of the molecule .",
    "the process is the following : i ) the molecule is aligned with a ns pulse .",
    "we assume that the switching - on of the laser is adiabatic and that the torsional - rotational wavefunction is an eigenstate of the field - dressed hamiltonian , ii ) a short resonant laser excites the ground state potential electronic surface to an excited electronic state of the molecule .",
    "we approximate this process as instantaneous , because it is much faster than the torsional time scale of the molecule .",
    "then we can use the sudden approximation and propagate the torsional wavepacket in this new torsional potential .",

    "<S> we analyze theoretically the interplay between the torsional and the rotational motion of an aligned biphenyl - like molecule . to do so , we consider a transition between two electronic states with different internal torsional potentials , induced by means of a resonant laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the internal torsional potential provokes the motion of the torsional wavepacket in the excited electronic state , modifying the structure of the molecule , and hence , its inertia tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this process has a strong impact on the rotational wave function , displaying different behavior depending on the electronic states involved and their associated torsional potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the dynamics of the system by considering the degree of alignment and the expectations values of the angular momentum operators for the overall rotation of the molecule . </S>"
