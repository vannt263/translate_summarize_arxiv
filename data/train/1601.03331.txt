    "a star passing close to a supermassive black hole ( smbh ; @xmath4m@xmath5 ) will be torn apart by tidal forces @xcite . the accretion of the resulting bound stellar debris results in a luminous transient known as a tidal disruption flare ( tdf ; @xcite ) . unlike active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the accretion resulting from a tdf is deterministic , and the rate that mass first returns to the smbh is straightforward to derive @xcite .",
    "for some systems the accretion rate is predicted to transition from highly super - eddington to sub - eddington on a time scale of months to years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , tdfs can serve as `` sign - posts , '' indicating the presence of a smbh in galaxies that are otherwise not actively accreting .",
    "thanks in part to the rapid growth in wide - field optical surveys , the tdf discovery rate has experienced a remarkable increase in recent years .",
    "optical spectra of ps1 - 10jh , the first tdf with extensive real - time follow - up observations from such surveys , revealed broad [ full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) @xmath6kms@xmath2 ] emission lines , but lacked detectable balmer h emission @xcite .",
    "the low h : he ratio has led to a vigorous debate within the community , with possible explanations including the disruption of a h - poor star @xcite ; optical - depth effects @xcite in a radially truncated ( but h - rich ) broad - line region ( blr ; * ? ? ? * ) ; complex photoionization processes within an ( h - rich ) envelope surrounding the accretion disk @xcite ; and stellar evolution ( i.e. , h burning ) in the core of a @xmath8m@xmath5 star @xcite .",
    "more recently , a larger sample of optically discovered tdfs has revealed a wide range of h : he line ratios @xcite , and still others appear to lack emission lines altogether ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the nature of this emission is critical for developing a theoretical framework to robustly infer smbh properties ( e.g. , mass ) from tdf observations . to this end",
    ", we have undertaken a campaign to obtain rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of tdf candidates with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. by analogy with quasars , we anticipate that the strongest atomic lines will appear in the rest - frame uv .",
    "similarly , the more - distant events discovered in the near future by , for example , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) will be observed at these rest - frame uv wavelengths . in this _ letter _",
    "we present the first spectrum obtained as part of this uv spectroscopy program , of the nearby tdf asassn-14li .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath9cdm cosmology with parameters from @xcite : @xmath10kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "all quoted uncertainties are 1@xmath13 ( 68% ) confidence intervals unless otherwise noted , and utc times are used throughout .",
    "the all - sky automated survey for supernova ( asassn ; @xcite ) first detected asassn-14li in @xmath14-band images obtained on 2014 nov 11.65 in the nucleus of the galaxy pgc043234 @xcite .",
    "pre - outburst observations from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) indicate that the host galaxy is dominated by an old stellar population ( @xmath15gyr ) with a stellar mass @xmath16m@xmath17 and a redshift of @xmath18 @xcite . at distance",
    "@xmath19mpc , asassn-14li was exquisitely observed across the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "we highlight the following previous results .    *",
    "the broadband spectral energy distribution requires the presence of multiple emission components @xcite .",
    "the observed x - ray emission is well fit by a blackbody with @xmath20k @xcite ; however , extrapolating this model to optical wavelengths grossly underpredicts the observed flux .",
    "a second blackbody with @xmath21k can reasonably describe the optical emission , though the peak is largely unconstrained @xcite .",
    "* evidence for a high - velocity outflow [ @xmath22@xmath23kms@xmath2 ] and a low - velocity outflow ( @xmath24100400)kms@xmath2 ) was derived from nonthermal radio emission @xcite and high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy @xcite , respectively .",
    "outflows are predicted to accompany accretion at super - eddington rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though typically only with large velocities . * the optical spectra of asassn-14li",
    "are dominated by a blue continuum and asymmetric , broad [ fwhm @xmath25@xmath26kms@xmath2 ] emission lines of balmer h and @xcite .",
    "we obtained uv spectra of asassn-14li with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ; program i d go-13853 ) on _ hst _ beginning at 08:40 on 2015 jan 10 ( @xmath27d after initial detection ) .",
    "stis was deployed with two different instrumental configurations , both utilizing the 52@xmath28 0.2  aperture : the g230l grating with the near - uv ( nuv ) mama detector , providing wavelength coverage of 15703180  at a resolution ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath30 ( 1750s exposure time ) , and the g140l grating with the far - uv ( fuv ) mama detector , providing wavelength coverage of 11501730  at @xmath31 ( 2888s exposure time ) .",
    "we downloaded the processed frames from the _ hst _ archive and examined the resulting two - dimensional spectra .",
    "for both the fuv and nuv spectra , the trace from asassn-14li is well detected and ( spatially ) unresolved , so we make use of the standard pipeline product one - dimensional spectra for our analysis . after a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr)-weighted combination of the fuv and nuv frames and dereddening for absorption in the milky way [ @xmath32mag ; @xcite ] , the resulting uv spectrum of asassn-14li is plotted in figure  [ fig : specobs ] .",
    "we caution that wavelengths near 1216  are significantly affected by geocoronal airglow emission and will not be used for analysis here . upon publication",
    "we will make the spectrum of asassn-14li available via wiserep @xcite .",
    "to estimate the continuum level , we fit the portion of the spectrum with @xmath33  to a blackbody function . the best - fit model , with @xmath34k ,",
    "is overplotted in figure  [ fig : specobs ] .",
    "the fuv flux is , as expected , somewhat underpredicted by this model , but it seems to capture the continuum underlying the broad fuv emission features reasonably well .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity implied is @xmath35ergs@xmath2 , a factor of @xmath362 larger than the integrated emission in the observed bandpass [ @xmath37ergs@xmath2 ] .",
    "the derived uv continuum temperature at this epoch is consistent with previous estimates based on blackbody fits to broadband optical and near - uv photometry @xcite . as noted by these authors , a single blackbody can not simultaneous account for the luminous optical / uv and x - ray emission .        in figure",
    "[ fig : specobs ] , we also overplot the results of a radiative - transfer simulation from @xcite .",
    "this particular geometry consists of an outer envelope of 0.125m@xmath5 of material extending out to @xmath38 cm ( a factor of @xmath39 larger than the radius inferred from our blackbody fits above ) , with a density profile of @xmath40 .",
    "the envelope is illuminated by an underlying continuum with a photospheric radius of @xmath41 cm and a bolometric luminosity of @xmath42ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting output spectrum is not a formal `` fit '' to the data , and furthermore only contains atomic species of h , he , and o at solar abundances .",
    "however , it is illustrative that the observed uv continuum slope is quite well reproduced with such a geometry .",
    "we fit emission and absorption features to a gaussian model , allowing the central wavelength , line width , and equivalent width to vary as free parameters .",
    "the local continuum level was estimated from nearby wavelength bins .",
    "the results of this analysis are displayed in table  [ tab : features ] .",
    "we identify three distinct classes of features : narrow absorption from the milky way , and narrow absorption and broad emission at or near the host redshift .",
    "we detect a series of narrow ( fwhm @xmath43kms@xmath2 ) absorption features from standard metal transitions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at wavelengths near their rest values .",
    "given their proximity to rest wavelengths and the lack of additional intervening material , we associate these features with an absorber in or near the milky way galaxy . we calculate a weighted average redshift for the absorber of @xmath44 , or a velocity relative to the heliocentric reference frame of @xmath45kms@xmath2 .",
    "for the galactic coordinates of asassn-14li ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , this results in a comparable velocity in the local standard of rest .",
    "this velocity is indicative of a high - velocity cloud ( hvc ; @xcite ) .      while the absorption features from the milky way",
    "generally resemble those observed in the ism of high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the narrow absorption features observed from the host galaxy of asassn-14li are markedly different . with the notable exception of weak @xmath481335 , nearly all transitions from low - ionization metal states",
    "are absent ( figure  [ fig : lowion])  could correspond either to @xmath482853  from the milky way or @xmath48 2796 from the tdf host .",
    "given the lack of corresponding @xmath48 2803 at the host redshift , we associate this with the milky way absorber . ] .",
    "similarly , ly@xmath49 is extremely weak : assuming the gas is optically thin , we derive a lower limit to the column density of @xmath50@xmath51 . at first glance ,",
    "the weak absorption is not entirely surprising , given the old stellar population observed in the host galaxy .",
    "but standard high - ionization absorption lines , such as @xmath521548 , 1551 , @xmath521394 , 1403 , and @xmath521239 , 1243  are well detected ( figure  [ fig : highion ] ) .",
    "we measure a weighted average for the absorber redshift of @xmath53 , marginally below the value measured in the ( quiescent ) host .",
    "a number of broad emission features are also apparent , including @xmath521548 , 1551 , @xmath521394 , 1403 , @xmath521239 , 1243 , and ly@xmath49 .",
    "we further identify the feature at @xmath54  as @xmath481640 , given the strong @xmath484686   emission observed in the optical spectra of asassn-14li @xcite .",
    "this line was predicted to appear in the uv spectra of tdfs by @xcite , but with a p - cygni profile not readily identified here .",
    "it also appears prominently in the radiative - transfer simulations of @xcite ( figure  [ fig : specobs]).kms@xmath2 for their spectra ; this profile and line width were not an output of the simulation .",
    "] this line may be blended with ] @xmath481663 , but the low snr precludes firm conclusions .",
    "we associate two additional features with ] @xmath481750  and ] @xmath481486  ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we are unable to identify two remaining lines , both relatively weak , at @xmath55  and @xmath56 .",
    "equally of interest are common quasar absorption features that are entirely lacking from the uv spectrum of asassn-14li : @xmath522796 , 2804  and ] @xmath481909  ( figure  [ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "after manually excising narrow absorption features in the regions of interest , we fit the emission lines to a gaussian model , as described above .",
    "the width of the emission features varies considerably , from fwhm @xmath57kms@xmath2 for @xmath521394 , 1403  to 1700kms@xmath2 for ] @xmath481486  ( corresponding to distances of @xmath58150au for virialized gas orbiting a @xmath59m@xmath5 smbh ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , aside from one of the unidentified features , the two n transitions are significantly more narrow than the remainder of the lines .",
    "even the largest velocities measured here are substantially smaller than those measured from optical lines [ fwhm @xmath25@xmath26kms@xmath2 ; @xcite ] .    for features where both narrow absorption and broad emission are detected ,",
    "the absorption features are blueshifted : @xmath60kms@xmath2 for @xmath521548 , 1551 , and @xmath61kms@xmath2 for @xmath521394 , 1403 .",
    "finally , we note that we did not attempt to fit either the broad ly@xmath49 or @xmath521239 , 1243  host emission features , owing to both their clear blending and the large number of narrow absorption features at these wavelengths .",
    "the absorption feature blueward of ly@xmath49 is from gas in the hvc ; none of the lines shows evidence for a p - cygni profile .",
    "as a starting place for discussion , the most natural point of comparison is with quasars ( qsos ) , given that both are powered by accretion onto a smbh . in figure  [ fig : comp ] we overplot the composite qso spectrum from sdss @xcite .",
    "even compared with a qso , the continuum emission from asassn-14li is significantly bluer .",
    "together with the luminous , thermal x - ray emission , the nature of the continuum in asassn-14li appears to be significantly different from that observed in typical qsos . in terms of line features ,",
    "our first task is to understand the source of the emitting and absorbing material .",
    "the lack of common low - ionization absorption features , together with the old host stellar population , indicate that the absorber is unlikely to arise in the cold host ism .",
    "given that nearly every @xmath62 galaxy exhibits a circumgalactic medium ( ggm ) consisting of strong ly@xmath49 absorption and ( frequently ) low - ionization absorption @xcite , there is a reasonable probability that gas in the halo of the host galaxy contributes to the observed absorption .",
    "however , the detection of @xmath521239 , 1243  is difficult to account for in such a cgm environment ( werk et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    the host galaxy does show evidence for a pre - outburst agn , and so the absorber could result from pre - existing gas in ( or possibly expelled from ; @xcite ) the nuclear region .",
    "alternatively , the absorber may result from the ( bound ) debris of the disrupted star .",
    "we argue this is the simplest explanation , as the same material responsible for the x - ray outflow @xcite could also produce uv absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the comparable blueshift ( with respect to the broad emission lines ) observed in the uv and x - rays further supports this conclusion .",
    "the emission lines present in asassn-14li are to first order analogous to a blr in a qso : clearly there is fast - moving ( @xmath63kms@xmath2 ) material photoionized ( or collisionally excited ) by the blue continuum .",
    "however , closer examination reveals an extremely unusual abundance pattern . strong ] @xmath481486  and ] @xmath481750  are extremely rare in qsos , with only @xmath64% of sdss systems exhibiting such features @xcite .",
    "the lack of ] @xmath481909  and @xmath522796 , 2804  emission is particularly striking .",
    "we have searched through the sdss qso database to identify other examples of systems that either ( a ) exhibit strong ] @xmath481486  and ] @xmath481750  emission , and/or ( b ) display large @xmath521548 , 1551  equivalent widths , but weak or nonexistent @xmath522796 , 2804  emission . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the former group has been previously identified as the `` n - rich '' qsos @xcite .",
    "@xcite argues that these n - rich qsos are in fact the tidal disruption of a @xmath8m@xmath5 star , for which the high n abundance results from significant cno processing in the stellar core ( predisruption ) .",
    "while the similarity between n - rich qsos and asassn-14li is indeed intriguing , we note several important caveats .",
    "first , we examined all the n - rich systems identified by @xcite , and every one ( in the appropriate redshift range ) exhibited detectable ] @xmath481909  and @xmath522796 , 2804emission lines .",
    "mg should be unaffected by the cno cycle .",
    "the absence of could be the result of photoionization from the extremely hot continuum : given that the ionization energy of is 80.1ev ( comparable to the ionization energy of of 77.5ev ) , there are clearly many photons capable of further electron stripping . in this case , the absence of may be _ transient _ in nature , as the underlying continuum temperature must cool eventually .",
    "in addition , only a small fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the n - rich qsos exhibit narrow , blueshifted absorption lines as were observed for asassn-14li .",
    "again , however , if related to accretion at super - eddington rates , these absorption features could also be transient in nature .",
    "future spectra of asassn-14li , when the accretion rate has dropped and the continuum cooled , are a critical test of this explanation",
    ".    we also plot in figure  [ fig : comp ] an example qso spectrum with well - detected @xmath521548 , 1551 , but weak or nonexistent @xmath522796 , 2804  emission . of the 78,223 qsos in the catalog of @xcite with well - detected @xmath521548 ,",
    "1551  and @xmath66 , only 269 ( 0.3% ) lack detectable @xmath522796 , 2804  ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we visually inspected these 269 `` mg - poor '' qsos , and in nearly all cases the lack of @xmath522796 , 2804  is due to decreased sensitivity at the relevant ( observed ) wavelength .",
    "all these sources have well - detected ] @xmath481909  lines .",
    "detailed photoionization modeling may help to shed further light on the nature of the emitting gas .",
    "for example , the lack of ] @xmath481909  could be explained if the gas were above the critical density of @xmath68@xmath69 @xcite ; constraints from the x - ray spectrum place a lower limit of @xmath70@xmath69 .",
    "similarly , if the narrow width of the ( semi - forbidden ) n lines were caused by collisional de - excitation ( and not , say , distance from the source ) , this may also constrain the density of the emitting gas .",
    "however , we caution that assumptions underlying standard agn photoionization tools ( e.g. , cloudy ; @xcite ) may not hold for tdfs @xcite .    to the extent that asassn-14li is representative of the broader tdf population , the uv spectrum is extremely promising for the _ detection _ of high - redshift events by future wide - field optical surveys . with the blue continuum ( and no evidence for dust )",
    ", the resulting negative k - correction will greatly enhance detectability : asassn-14li , for example , would be easily detectable by lsst out to @xmath71 ( @xmath72mag at @xmath73gpc ) . furthermore , the extremely blue continuum should clearly distinguish tdfs from other classes of transients @xcite .",
    "however , based on this result , it is clear that we have yet to reach a complete picture of the process by which the emission is generated following the tidal disruption process .",
    "the simplest analytic models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which assume rapid circularization of the bound debris , may miss fundamental physics governing the observed signal @xcite . as is clear from our spectrum of asassn-14li , the line formation is a complex process , and qsos are an imperfect analog . without improved understanding of how ( and where )",
    "the emission is generated , it will be quite challenging to utilize tdfs as probes of distant smbhs .",
    "finally , the path forward ( observationally ) is quite clear .",
    "time - resolved spectra should solve many of the puzzles presented here . a reverberation mapping campaign ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "would be an incredibly powerful discriminant for future events .",
    "furthermore , additional nearby examples are necessary to determine if asassn-14li is indeed a fair representation of the broader tdf population , or if something unique about asassn-14li ( nature of the disrupted star , orbit , geometry , etc . )",
    "gives rise to both luminous x - ray and optical / uv emission .",

    "<S> the absorption lines are blueshifted with respect to the emission lines by @xmath3400)kms@xmath2 . due both to this velocity offset and the lack of common low - ionization features ( , ) </S>",
    "<S> , we argue these arise from the same absorbing material responsible for the low - velocity outflow discovered at x - ray wavelengths . </S>",

    "<S> detailed modeling of this spectrum will help elucidate fundamental questions regarding the nature of the emission processes at work in tdfs , while future uv spectroscopy of asassn-14li would help to confirm ( or refute ) the previously proposed connection between tdfs and `` n - rich '' quasars . </S>"
