    "@xmath5 is the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath6 on site @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the corresponding number operator . throughout this article",
    "we take @xmath9 as energy unit .    in the momentum space",
    "this hamiltonian reads as : @xmath10 with @xmath11    the usual hubbard - model ( @xmath12 ) has a van hove singularity in the density of states at half filling in the noninteracting case ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is possible to move this van hove singularity to any electron filling by extending the hubbard model by an additional next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1-term in the kinetic energy .",
    "the @xmath0-hubbard model @xcite shows superconductivity for repulsive interactions @xmath14 with d@xmath15-symmetry @xcite and for attractive interaction with on site s - symmetry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    as a measure for the superconductivity",
    "we calculate the reduced two particle density matrix according to the concept of yang @xcite . from this two particle density matrix",
    "we calculate the two particle correlation functions for different symmetries and additionally we calculate the vertex correlation function @xcite .",
    "the van hove scenario predicts an increase of @xmath16 for fillings close to a van hove singularity @xcite .",
    "we study the influence of the van hove singularity on the superconducting correlation functions by modifying the @xmath1-hopping parameter for fixed fillings .",
    "here we use the lanczos - algorithm @xcite , @xcite as exact diagonalization technique to determine the ground state and from there ground state properties of the @xmath0-hubbard model .",
    "the basic limitations on the calculations of large system sizes with the lanczos - algorithm is the huge memory consumption of this method .",
    "but to our surprise we found that even for hubbard systems of size @xmath17 , which the lanczos method is capable of handling , the cpu consumption of the simulations was substantial and made a detailed scan of the parameter space given by interaction strength @xmath14 , filling @xmath18 and next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 almost impossible .",
    "we therefore implemented the lanczos - method on ibm sp2 parallel computer with mpi ( message passing interface ) for the communication between the processes to speed up the calculations .",
    "before turning our attention to the parallel techniques we outline the basic concept of the lanczos method @xcite . in the case of the exact diagonalization the hamiltonian @xmath19 of the system",
    "is written in matrix or heisenberg representation .",
    "one chooses an orthonormal single particle basis , to represent the many - particle states . for the @xmath0-hubbard model",

    "we calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath19 . in the lanczos - scheme",
    "it is not necessary to transform the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "therefore it is even not necessary to store the matrix elements @xmath61 ; they are only calculated , when they are needed for the further evaluation of the lanczos - iteration ( eq .  [ eqlanczos ] ) .",
    "in this section we concentrate our effort on how to speed up the simulations with the lanczos method .",
    "the determination of the ground state properties of a hamiltonian with the lanczos  algorithm consists of two main parts concerning the consumption of cpu - time .",
    "first the ground state energy @xmath62 and the ground state @xmath63 are calculated .",
    "the second main part is the determination of the two  particle density matrix @xcite : @xmath64 as the main observable of interest .      to handle an arbitrary state @xmath55 it is necessary to know for each basis state @xmath26 the indices @xmath37 and @xmath65 of the creation operators in eq .",
    "[ eqphi ] and the weights @xmath27 .",
    "a simple possibility for such an algorithm is the bitcoding or bitrepresentation of the basis states . here",
    "the momenta @xmath37 are labeled from @xmath66 to @xmath29 and the momenta @xmath65 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "then the states @xmath26 are expressed by an one dimensional array of bits , which are one for occupied sites , and otherwise the bits are zero . if one interprets this array as binary representation of an integer number one has an algorithm to assign each basis state @xmath69 an index @xmath70 .",
    "as example we take a lattice with 4 sites and each two electrons with spin up and down : @xmath71 for any many particle state only the coefficients @xmath72 need to be stored .",
    "but the bitrepresentation has the great disadvantage , that a huge amount of memory is wasted , because the bitrepresentation of many integer numbers @xmath70 does not correspond to a valid basis state . for a system with @xmath29 latticepoints in an array of the length @xmath73 one only stores @xmath74 numbers . for the above example @xmath75 and @xmath53",
    "there is @xmath76 .",
    "therefore it is desirable to use another algorithm ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "one example is the hashing algorithm @xcite .",
    "we developed a new algorithm .",
    "though we only present results for the momentum space representation , this algorithm can also be implemented very efficiently for the exact diagonalization in real space @xcite .",
    "first we are numbering the momenta from 1 to @xmath29 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "second we define @xmath79 to fix the sign .    the state with the number @xmath66 is @xmath80 in @xmath81 the electron @xmath82 moves from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . in @xmath85",
    "this `` last '' electron has reached the latticepoint @xmath29 .",
    "next in @xmath86 the two creation operators with the highest index are increased by one , @xmath87 then the `` last '' creation operator moves .",
    "these are the states with the numbers @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "next the `` last '' two electrons go to the sites @xmath84 and @xmath90 . if both electrons have reached the final two lattice sites ( @xmath91 , @xmath29 ) three electrons move in the same manner through the lattice .",
    "one gets the number @xmath92 of the state @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the position of the electron @xmath96 in the lattice .    using the translational invariance of the hamiltonian in the k - space representation means , that we keep the total momentum @xmath35 of the basis states @xmath97 fixed . in this case",
    "one can only choose the `` spin - up '' part of the basis state free and take such a `` spin - down '' state , that eq .",
    "[ eqk ] is full filled .",
    "this means , we must use another convention to label the states .",
    "we generate all states @xmath98 in the sequence as described above and calculate the momentum . for each momentum",
    "we count independently the indices .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 are now labeled in following way : first we combine with state number 1 , momentum 1 and spin up with all possible states with spin down for a given @xmath35 .",
    "then we do the same with state number 2 , momentum 1 and spin up .",
    "next we switch to state 1 with momentum 2 and spin up and so on .      in the parallel algorithm each of the @xmath99 processes stores the coefficients @xmath27 of @xmath100 basis states .",
    "@xmath27 is stored on process @xmath101 .      in the lanczos method",
    "it is necessary to perform a matrix - vector multiplication between the matrix @xmath19 and a lanczos - vector @xmath102 . in the parallel algorithm",
    "this is carried out in the following way : for @xmath103 :    * each process @xmath104 calculates the index numbers @xmath70 of the basis states @xmath105 , the multiplication results for the @xmath7-th state and the process , on which the states @xmath70 are stored . *",
    "each process exchanges the multiplication results and the numbers @xmath70 of the basis states , which are not stored on the process , with process @xmath106 .      to calculate the two - particle density matrix @xmath107 in an efficient way ,",
    "one only calculates the elements @xmath108 which are nonzero .",
    "that means one takes a basis state @xmath109 , one of the @xmath110 possible combinations of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 and applies @xmath115 to @xmath116 , afterwards one calculates the index number of this transformed basis state @xmath117 .",
    "each process stores the complete matrix @xmath107 .",
    "this matrix takes for example in the @xmath17 system @xmath118 byte or @xmath119 kbyte of memory .    in this algorithm",
    "one has to calculate @xmath120 expectation values , compared to @xmath121 expectation values that would be calculated if one took all combinations @xmath97 and @xmath122 into account . in a @xmath123 system with @xmath53 electrons @xmath124 and the amount of saved cpu - time is significant . but in a @xmath17 system with only @xmath125 electrons @xmath126 and this algorithm is slower .    to calculate @xmath107 we use a similar way for the exchange of the weights and numbers as for matrix - vector multiplication",
    "( see section [ sectionmatmult ] ) .    at the end",
    "the values of the arrays @xmath107 of all processes are summed on one process .",
    "first we take a look on the dependence of the cpu time of one lanczos iteration ( eq.[eqlanczos ] ) for a different number of processes .",
    "as example we use a @xmath123 lattice with three different numbers of electrons ( fig .",
    "[ cpuiter ] ) .",
    "the small decay from 1 to 2 processes is due to communication between processes which is only necessary for more than one process .",
    "then one sees as expected a decrease of computation time .",
    "as expected this decrease vanishes for an increasing number of processes , since the communication is growing with the number of processes .    in figure [ cpucorr ]",
    "we examine the cpu - consumption for the two - particle density matrix for the same system size and fillings as in figure [ cpuiter ] . here",
    "the gain of time is much larger than for the calculation of the energy . in this case",
    "more computation is performed for the determination of one matrix element . for more than 2 processes",
    "the dependence of nodes and cpu - time is nearly linear .",
    "this can be understood , if we look on the numbering of the states .",
    "most of the states @xmath127 are stored on the same node and only for a fraction of these states the weights must be interchanged with an other process .",
    "summarizing the algorithm for this parallel implementation of the lanczos - iteration and the determination of the two - particle density matrix is a coarse grained algorithm and therefore achieves a good speed - up on a parallel computer like the ibm sp2 , with only some , but very powerful , processors .",
    "for very many processors the communication grows dramatically and no further speed - up is reachable .",
    "now we want to turn our attention from the technical points of view to physical properties of the @xmath0-hubbard model .",
    "especially we study the influence of the next nearest hopping parameter @xmath1 on the ground state energy and superconducting correlation functions in the ground state of a @xmath17 cluster .",
    "we focus to @xmath128 electrons which corresponds to a filling @xmath129 .",
    "this is a so called closed shell situation , which can be also handled with the projector quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "first we study the ground state energy @xmath62 in the attractive @xmath0-hubbard model ( fig .",
    "[ emin ] ) . for small and intermediate interaction strength ( @xmath130 )",
    "there is a visible difference between the energy with @xmath12 and @xmath131 .",
    "this difference results from the changes in the structure of @xmath132 ( eq.[eqepsilon ] ) with @xmath1 .",
    "but for large interaction strength @xmath133 the influence of the kinetic part is vanishing . in this interaction regime",
    "the ground state energy is approximately linear with @xmath14 and approaches slowly the energy @xmath134 of the system without hopping .",
    "next we turn our attention to the superconducting correlation functions . in the concept of off diagonal long range order @xcite",
    "the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of @xmath107 is calculated .",
    "the quantum monte carlo algorithms handle system sizes , where it is impossible to calculate the complete two - particle density matrix due to the memory consumptions @xcite . in order to compare the exact diagonalization results with the quantum monte carlo data we study two - particle correlation functions for certain symmetries @xcite , e.g. @xmath135 where the index s denotes the on site s - wave symmetry and d the @xmath136-wave symmetry .",
    "the factor @xmath137 gives the signs of the d - wave .",
    "( @xmath138 in x- and @xmath139 in y - direction ) these full correlation functions have nonzero values even for a system with no interaction .",
    "responsible for this are the one - particle correlation functions @xmath140 which decay to zero with @xmath141 and thus do not really contribute to the long range behavior that signals superconductivity .",
    "to exclude the contribution of the one - particle correlation functions we define the vertex correlation function as @xmath142    in figure [ corrvgl ] we show @xmath143 and @xmath144 in dependence of the distance @xmath145 . for @xmath146",
    "there is a visible difference only for @xmath147 . for @xmath148",
    "the one - particle contributions are dominant . in this case",
    "it is important to study the vertex correlation function to get the `` superconducting '' correlations .",
    "but already for @xmath149 and @xmath150 the difference between full and vertex correlation function is less than 30% and it is less important to take @xmath151 in account .    as a measure for the superconductivity in a system",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ neguvertex ] the average of the vertex correlation function @xmath152    for a small interaction strength @xmath133 the increase of the correlation functions is small . between @xmath149 and @xmath153 there is a strong increase . finally at @xmath154 the curves flatten .    for correlation functions",
    "the influence of the additional hopping @xmath1 remains important even if there is nearly no difference in the energies ( cp .",

    "the finite size gap @xmath158 in the energy dispersion @xmath132 ( eq .  [ eqepsilon ] ) of the free system ( @xmath13 ) between the highest occupied state and the lowest unoccupied state is given in this case by : @xmath159 this means the finite size gap is becoming smaller with increasing @xmath160 .",
    "according to @xcite this will lead to an increase in the superconducting correlations .",

    "there a maximum of @xmath16 is predicted by the van hove scenario @xcite .",
    "but for small system sizes one can not really speak of a van hove singularity",
    ". therefore the results of figure [ negutprime ] are not in contradiction to the van hove scenario .    yet , the question remains , whether the observed increase of the correlation function results only from a vanishing finite size gap or is related to changes of the fermi surface . to clarify this point",
