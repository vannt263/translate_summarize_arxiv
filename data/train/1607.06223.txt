    "recent advances in manipulating ultra - cold bosons in optical traps have opened up new experimental scenarios for experimentally investigating coherent transport phenomena .",
    "examples of new techniques include `` potential painting '' , which allows for the dynamical formulation of almost arbitrary potentials  @xcite , and the use of an electron beam to empty chosen wells of an optical lattice system  @xcite . combined with the well - known techniques of scattering length change via feshbach resonance  @xcite , such methods allow fine - tuned , dynamical control over nearly all experimental parameters .",
    "for example , labouvie _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite reported on the observation of negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) of atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "they used the electron beam to remove a proportion of the atoms from a given well and measured the filling rate from the neighbouring wells as a function of chemical potential difference .",
    "the key signature is the decrease in the atomic current as the chemical potential difference is increased , a clear manifestation of non - ohmic behaviour .",
    "ndc is an unusual phenomenon in electronics because it requires a strongly nonlinear device . in ultracold atom transport",
    ", nonlinearity is readily available through atomic collisions .",
    "the challenge in a cold - atom implementation of ndc is to obtain a ( quasi ) steady - state current , which in @xcite was achieved through dephasing induced by intrawell multilevel effects .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate nonohmic atomic transport in a bose - hubbard chain both with and without dephasing .",
    "although inspired by @xcite , the model we use is strictly one - dimensional , without the transverse degrees of freedom that dominate the dynamics in that experiment .",
    "there are several reasons for this choice .",
    "first , the simplicity of the bose - hubbard model permits us to cleanly investigate the competing effects of nonlinearity and coherence on atom transport .",
    "second , we are able to explore the role of dephasing per se , without the complications of multiple levels at each site . and finally , with few modes ( 1 per site ) , we enter a regime where quantum effects are important , and which we investigate through the impact of different initial quantum states .    in the electronic context",
    ", negative differential conductivity was first described in the transport of electrons in a crystalline superlattice  @xcite , where an increase in the electric field resulted in a decrease in electron flow .",
    "the phenomenon was subsequently observed in single - molecule junctions  @xcite , in suspended metallic single - walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite , and in graphene transistors  @xcite . in cold atoms systems ,",
    "ndc and other departures from ohmic behaviour are driven by a number - dependence of the on - site energy or chemical potential , caused by collisional interactions . in the experimental realisation in @xcite",
    ", these collisional effects occur in the context of many energy levels per site , which gave rise to dephasing and number - dependent tunnelling . in the simpler bose - hubbard model ,",
    "the collisional energy differences give rise to macroscopic self - trapping ( mst )  @xcite .",
    "we show that mst by itself is sufficient to cause ndc for initially oscillatory atomic currents .",
    "the addition of sufficient dephasing allows dc current to be observed .",
    "we examine the dynamics of the three - well bose - hubbard model in which the middle well is initially less occupied than the others .",
    "this system without collisional dephasing has previously been analysed by penna  @xcite , in what he named the central depleted well regime .",
    "aspects of a similar system have also been analysed by kordas _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , who found that phase diffusion could enhance tunneling and damp coherent oscillations in the tunneling .",
    "kordas and others have also analysed the influence of atomic losses on a bose - hubbard system , outlining various useful theoretical approaches  @xcite .",
    "we numerically simulate the quantum dynamics using stochastic equations derived through the truncated wigner representation .",
    "the simulations quantify the contributions of dephasing , number difference , collisional interaction strength , and initial quantum states to ndc in the three - well model .",
    "we find that we can drastically alter the current through the middle well by changing the collisional nonlinearity , which can in principle be done using feshbach resonance techniques  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of dephasing in the middle well reduces the currents in some regimes , but does not qualitatively affect the relationship between the maximum current and the number difference .",
    "we find that , in contrast , the initial quantum states can have a large effect on the current , demonstrating that the preparation of an experimental system can have a drastic effect on the subsequent dynamics .",
    "assuming a tight - binding approximation , @xcite , we model the optical lattice system by a three - site bose - hubbard chain  @xcite , with one orbital per site .",
    "we focus on a symmetric distribution of atoms with the middle well initially empty , in analogy to @xcite , where the electron beam was used to remove atoms from a chosen well .",
    "an important feature of the experiment @xcite was that scattering of atoms amongst the many available radial modes induced an effective phase diffusion in the initially empty well .",
    "we include a controlled level of phase diffusion in our model , which could be implemented by a random variation of the central well depth .",
    "the main effect of phase diffusion is to destroy coherences in the system density matrix , without changing the number distribution  @xcite .",
    "we note that decay of coherences has been predicted in the bose - hubbard model , even without added phase diffusion  @xcite .    introducing @xmath0 as the bosonic annihilation operator for atoms in well @xmath1 ,",
    "we may write the hamiltonian as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the tunnelling rate between the adjacent wells and @xmath4 is the collisional strength . the dynamics with phase diffusion are modelled via the master equation @xmath5 + { \\cal l}\\hat\\rho,\\ ] ] where the liouvillian superoperator is defined as @xmath6 with dephasing rate @xmath7 .",
    "our chosen method for this theoretical investigation is the truncated wigner approximation  @xcite , which has been found to be accurate over the time scales we consider here , and which can deal with high nonlinearities .",
    "the instances where this method is known to be inaccurate are not relevant to the present work  @xcite .",
    "the integration of the resultant stochastic differential equations is stable and the method does allow us to add more wells with reasonable computational cost .",
    "importantly , the wigner method can be used to implement the variety of different initial quantum states  @xcite that arise in a lattice model .",
    "for example , if the system is in the superfluid regime , the appropriate initial states are something close to coherent states .",
    "if it is in the mott insulator regime , or if isolated wells were brought together using recently developed `` potential painting '' techniques  @xcite , the appropriate initial condition would be fock states .",
    "following the usual methods  @xcite , we map the system master equation for the density operator onto a generalised fokker - planck equation for the wigner distribution . to obtain stable stochastic equations",
    ", third - order derivates must be neglected @xcite .",
    "even with this truncation , the approach goes beyond the bogoliubov backreaction method @xcite ) as it does not impose any factorisation on any higher order moments .",
    "the resultant stochastic equations in the it calculus  @xcite in the deterministic part of the equations gives the stratonovich form  @xcite .",
    "although either form may be used , the stratonovich form can be integrated using higher order algorithms than the simple euler method .",
    "care needs to be taken in the design of higher order methods for the integration of it equations .",
    "the applicability of different methods is covered in the documentation for the open source integration package xmds  @xcite . ] are @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a gaussian noise with correlations @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the @xmath12 are stochastic variables corresponding to the operators @xmath0 .",
    "averages of products of the wigner variables become approximately equal to the expectation values of symmetrically ordered operator moments in the limit of a large number of stochastic trajectories .",
    "we have found previously that the truncated wigner method gives results for these types of systems that are identical to those of matrix diagonalisation over the times of interest here .",
    "the advantage of our method is that the computational complexity is linear in the number of wells , so that more may easily be added .",
    "we calculate both the average number of atoms in each well , @xmath13 , and the atomic current into the middle well : @xmath14 because the current is generally not steady or even monotonic , the other quantity of interest is the maximum current , @xmath15 , which usually occurs early in the evolution .",
    "to evaluate the current in terms of something analogous to voltage between the middle well and the initially full ones , we define the quantity @xmath16 , \\label{eq : deltamu}\\ ] ] which in the thermodynamic limit is proportional to the difference in chemical potential between these wells  @xcite .    , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "the solid lines represent initial fock ( lower ) and coherent ( upper ) states for @xmath20 .",
    "the dash - dotted lines are the corresponding results for @xmath21 .",
    "all the wigner results presented in this and subsequent plots are averages of the order of one million stochastic trajectories , with sampling errors insignificant on the scale of the plots . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fockconum ] illustrates the impact of the initial quantum state and phase diffusion on the tunelling dynamics .",
    "we plot the population of the middle well for @xmath22 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath23 , for initial fock and coherent states in the two end wells .",
    "we see that the initial quantum statistics have a dramatic effect on the population dynamics whereast the phase diffusion acts mainly to damp out oscillations .",
    "note that @xmath24 is within the range considered by labouvie @xcite .",
    "such quantum statistical effects on the dynamics are similar to those observed in  @xcite for different bose - hubbard configurations , and demonstrate that mean - field approaches are of limited validity . to show this limited validity we have also integrated the classical equations with diffusion , these results being shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : classcompare ] .",
    "this figure compares the populations in the first and middle wells calculated using initial fock and coherent states with a completely classical method with added diffusion .",
    "the equations look the same as the wigner equations given above in eq .",
    "[ eq : wigner ] , but with initial conditions being fixed complex numbers rather than taken from a distribution .",

    "we see that both quantum solutions show ndc for slightly lower values of @xmath31 than found in the mean - field prediction .",
    "this is explained by the appearance of macroscopic self - trapping at slighty different values of @xmath31 for the quantum solutions .",

    "one of the interesting features reported by labouvie _ et al .",

    "indicate that the populations in the three wells become equal , with approximately @xmath45 atoms in each well . at this stage",
    ", all the coherences have decayed to zero and the tunneling current stops .    .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated atomic transport in a three - well bose - hubbard mode , revealing a type of negative differential conductivity driven by macroscopic self trapping . with moderate atom numbers in each of the outside wells",
    ", we find oscillatory populations , with the maximum of the tunneling current always on the first oscillation .",
    "the major quantitative influence on the size of these currents is the initial quantum states of the atomic modes in the outside wells , with marked differences between fock and coherent states . given recent experimental advances in the preparation of ultra - cold atomic systems , these predictions should be amenable to experimental investigation in the near future .",
    "the addition of phase diffusion serves to lower the current maxima in this oscillatory regime , but does not change the differential atomic conductivity from positive to negative . we find that , with added phase diffusion , the coherent state results are very similar to those found in a classical diffusive model .",
    "overall , the extra dephasing makes a quantitative , rather than qualitative , contribution to the current .",
    "moreover , the dc tunnelling regime induced by dephasing only occurs for sufficiently large initial number difference .",
