    ". however , fig .",
    "[ phenixpoverpi ] and [ phenixpi0overcharged ] from the phenix collaboration showing the relative populations of mesons and baryons at high  present a challenge to this picture . in fig .",
    "[ phenixpoverpi ] the proton / pion ratios for peripheral collisions are in the vicinity of 0.3 - 0.4 , consistent with many measurements of jet fragmentation in elementary collisions , but the ratios for central collisions are near or exceed unity for @xmath75 gev / c@xcite , very unlike conventional jet fragmentation in vacuum",
    ". this could be due to transverse radial flow ( hydrodynamic behavior ) , which has a strong mass dependence@xcite , extending `` soft '' physics into the nominally pertrubative regime .",
    "a second possibility is the cronin effect : significant enhancement of baryon relative to meson yields for @xmath18few gev / c has been measured in fixed target p+a measurements@xcite and may be attributable to initial state multiple scattering , though this measurement must be repeated at rhic energies for quantitative comparison .",
    "more exotic mechanisms such as baryon production via gluonic junctions@xcite have also been discussed in this context .",
    "r0.5     the ratios in fig .",
    "[ phenixpoverpi ] are measured to @xmath47 gev / c .",
    "it is important to establish whether the anomalous baryon enhancement for central collisions extends to higher  or whether the conventional jet fragmentation ratio is re - established . as a step in that direction , fig .",
    "[ phenixpi0overcharged ] shows the ratio of  to all charged hadrons for @xmath76 gev / c , for minimum bias au+au events . even for minimum bias",
    "the ratio is suppressed relative to the conventional expectation of 0.7 - 0.8 .",
    "this presents an important puzzle , but more detailed centrality dependence and explicit measurement of the baryon and meson fractions would help to ellucidate this phenomenon .",
    "the foregoing sections reveal the following facts about high  hadron production in au+au collisions at rhic energies :    * inclusive hadron production is suppressed in central collisions by a factor 4 - 5 , with no strong dependence within @xmath77 gev / c . * for non - central collisions , finite azimuthal correlations of leading hadrons with the reaction plane persist to @xmath57 gev / c .",
    "* near - angle two particle correlations show clear jet - like correlations for @xmath61 gev / c . * back - to - back two particle correlations show a striking suppression in central collisions .",
    "* the baryon / meson ratio for @xmath78 gev / c is strongly enhanced in central collisions , whereas it is consistent with jet fragmentation in vacuum for peripheral collisions .",
    "all but the last of these phenomena suggest a picture in which the system generated in nuclear collisions at rhic is largely opaque to high energy partons and only those jets produced on the periphery of the reaction zone and heading outwards survive and are observed .",
    "this scenario naturally generates the suppression of the inclusive spectra and the space - mometum correlation that produces , as well as the strong suppression of back - to - back pairs .",
    "r0.65     [ starsqrts ]    additional support for this picture comes from fig .",

    "the inclusive rates grow but the anisotropy does not change , suggesting that the origin of  is geometric , not dynamic .    however , this picture as presented is only qualitative , and it remains to be shown whether a surface emission model can simultaneously describe the inclusive suppression , , and the suppression of back - to - back pairs . the anomalous baryon / meson ratio presents a puzzle and does not seem to fit into this picture",
    ". that effect may be due to conventional mechanisms such as transverse radial flow or initial state multiple scattering , or more exotic physics such as baryon production via gluonic junctions@xcite .",
    "further analysis of existing data and measurements of d+au collisons at rhic are needed to clarify these issues .",
    "finally , it is necessary to establish what , precisely , is interacting with the medium and being absorbed : partons or hadrons ?",
    "simple estimates of hadron formation time give @xmath80 for a hadron of radius @xmath81@xcite , so that a pion with @xmath51 gev / c is formed well outside of the hot and dense medium . alternatively , string interactions in matter prior to fragmentation lead to suppression the leading particle yields and a much shorter apparent formation time for high  hadrons@xcite .",
    "rhic has had two successful data - taking periods .",
    "it has met its design luminosity goal for au+au , and has operated as the world s first polarized proton collider .",
    "upcoming runs in 2003 will study asymmetric ( d+au ) collisions for the first time in a collider , together with an extended polarized proton run . a long au+au",
    "run at top energy will occur in 2004 , possibly with an energy scan at lower integrated luminosity .",
    "an extensive array of measurements in the soft physics sector indicate the production of an equilibrated system at high temperature and pressure which blows apart rapidly . in the high  sector ,",
    "striking signals have been observed that suggest strong partonic energy loss resulting from a system at high energy density at early time , though there remain important puzzles and open questions .",
