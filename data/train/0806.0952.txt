    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , neutrinos are massless .",
    "however , various experimental searches indicate that neutrinos have tiny masses ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "it is a challenging and important problem to explain the origin of the small neutrino masses .",
    "various mechanisms could generate neutrino masses  @xcite , in which the one with radiative neutrino mass generation without right - handed neutrinos by extending the higgs sector @xcite is particularly interesting because the neutrino masses are naturally small .",
    "it is clear that without the right - handed states the active neutrinos can only have majorana masses .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent cosmological observations have confirmed that not only there existed the inflationary stage in the early universe , but also at present the expansion of the universe is accelerating  @xcite . although various scenarios for the late - time acceleration in the expansion of the universe have been proposed , the cosmic acceleration mechanism is still not well understood @xcite .    in the framework of general relativity ,",
    "the current accelerating universe is due to the so - called dark energy ( or cosmological constant ) with its density at the present time is only about @xmath3 , which is much smaller than any known energy scale in particle physics except the neutrino masses .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy scale of dark energy coincides with the neutrino masses as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested  @xcite that the neutrino masses vary as a function of a scalar field , called the `` acceleron '' , which drives the universe to its present accelerating phase .",
    "such neutrinos are referred as mass varying neutrinos ( mavans ) .",
    "the effects of the mavans on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and large scale structure ( lss ) have been studied in ref .",
    "several models with the generation of the mavans through the see - saw mechanism with right - handed neutrinos to account for the baryon asymmetry in the universe have been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these studies",
    ", one has to break a global symmetry spontaneously to get a nambu - goldston boson ( ngb ) and introduce a soft symmetry breaking term so that the ngb receives a soft mass via a loop diagram and becomes a pseudo - nambu - goldston boson ( pngb ) .",
    "this pngb corresponds to the acceleron field in the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "some models to explain neutrino masses and dark energy at the tev scale have been explored in refs .",
    "moreover , the majorana neutrino superfluidity and the stability of the neutrino dark energy have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the generation of the small majorana neutrino masses through the radiative mechanism without right - handed neutrinos in the framework of the extended babu - zee model  @xcite . here",
    ", we do not introduce a soft breaking term `` by hand '' , but induce one from loop diagrams .",
    "in other words , we break global symmetries spontaneously in the first place , and then , via loop diagrams , introduce a soft ( original ) symmetry breaking term followed by a mass term for the pngb .",
    "this pngb also plays a role of the acceleron field . as a result",
    ", we show that the small neutrino masses depend on the pngb and we argue that the potential energy of the pngb can be the potential of dark energy .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the observed value of the equation of state ( eos ) parameter from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data on the anisotropy of the cmb radiation can be realized by following the discussion in refs .",
    "in the babu - zee model  @xcite , it contains only two extra scalar bosons beyond the sm , @xmath0 , one singly charged scalar ( @xmath4 ) and one doubly charged scalar ( @xmath5 ) . in this study",
    ", we would extend the babu - zee model  @xcite by considering three singly charged scalars : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; and three doubly charged scalars : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which carry different lepton numbers .",
    "in addition , we have to introduce singlet scalars ( @xmath12 ) to break the lepton number symmetries and induce non - zero phases . the particle contents and quantum numbers",

    "exist some tree - level lepton number violating processes . in our model , there are no such tree processes because we introduce more charged scalars couple to different `` pairs '' of leptons .",
    "however , these processes could be induced at the loop level , which will be ignored in our present discussions .",
    "furthermore , there is no t - channel @xmath5 exchange for the muonium - antimuonium oscillation because there are no @xmath55 and @xmath56 couplings in our model .",
    "moreover , there are no lepton number violating radiative decays of @xmath57 because different pairs of leptons are coupled by different charged scalars .",
    "on the other hand , in our model there are contributions to lepton number conserving processes such as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which give some loose constraints on the couplings of @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite . to illustrate the numerical estimation , by choosing that @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , all neutrino mass elements in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) are found to be @xmath64 .",
    "we note that since there are too many free parameters in the model , it is always possible to obtain the realistic neutrino mixings .",
    "finally , we remark that the three singlet fields of @xmath65 can be reduced to one without altering the feature of the model .",
    "similar to ref .  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , we can write down the induced potential for pngbs as follows : v(_1,_2,_3)~ , [ potential ] where @xmath66 is the ultraviolet cutoff . expanding eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , we obtain v()~ , [ potential-1 ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . note that in our minimal model , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are zero .",
    "we shall concentrate on the field of @xmath72 , which is the linear combination of the pngbs .",
    "we will demonstrate that in our model , the field @xmath72 plays a role of the acceleron field with the potential @xmath73 and the effective mass @xmath74 . to do this , we first examine the case in which the energy density in the dark sector @xmath75 is made of the densities of neutrinos ( @xmath76 ) and dark energy ( @xmath77 ) , given by @xmath78 where the dark energy density is assumed to be a function of neutrino masses ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath0 , @xmath80 . at the present time , because neutrinos are nonrelativistic , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the total number density of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "hence , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) we get @xmath83 here , we have concentrated on @xmath75 being stationary with respect to the variation of the neutrino masses , which implies that @xmath84    by defining the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath85 as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the total pressure of the dark sector of the universe and @xmath88 is the total energy density of it , we find  @xcite @xmath89 where in deriving the second approximate equality we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : e3 ] ) and @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the dark energy potential .",
    "we note that for the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e4 ] ) , we have neglected the contribution of any kinetic terms to the dark energy density .",
    "we now discuss the case in which the neutrino masses depend on some scalar field @xmath92 , called the acceleron , @xmath93 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e4 ] ) we obtain @xmath94    according to the five - year wmap data on the anisotropy of the cmb radiation  @xcite , the observed value of @xmath85 is @xmath95 .",
    "to have @xmath95 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e5 ] ) that the potential for @xmath92 has to be very flat , @xmath0 , @xmath96 , and/or the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath92 has to be very steep , @xmath0 , @xmath97 .",
    "hence , in our model the pngb @xmath72 corresponds to the acceleron field @xmath92 . from eq .",
    "( [ potential-1 ] ) , we find that the dark energy potential is given by @xmath98 for @xmath99 , which can be satisfied if the scale @xmath100 is sufficiently large , we find that |v()/ ( ) | = ( m_^4/v ) ( /v ) 0 .",
    "[ eq : e7 ] thus , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e5 ] ) and ( [ eq : e7 ] ) that in this model the observed relation @xmath95 can be realized .",
    "in summary , we have considered the generation of the small neutrino mass through the radiative mechanism in the extended babu - zee models . we have shown that the generated small neutrino masses depend on a pngb , which can play a role of the acceleron field and the potential energy of the pngb can be the dark energy potential . in particular , we have demonstrated that the observed value of the eos parameter from wmap can be realized .",
