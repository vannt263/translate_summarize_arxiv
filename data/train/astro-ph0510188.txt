    "the origin and the composition of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are still unknown .",
    "chemical composition studies  @xcite of the cr flux of both the agasa  @xcite and hires  @xcite experiments point to the dominance of protons above @xmath4  ev , but depend strongly on the details of hadronic interaction models used .",
    "another signature for extragalactic protons is a dip in the cr flux around @xmath5  ev seen in the experimental data of agasa , fly s eye , hires and yakutsk .",
    "this dip may be caused by energy losses of protons due to @xmath6 pair production on cosmic microwave photons  @xcite and was interpreted first by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite as signature for the dominance of extragalactic protons in the cr flux . finally , the uhecr proton spectrum should be strongly suppressed above @xmath7  ev due to pion production on cosmic microwave photons , the so called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite .",
    "the evidence for or against the presence of this cutoff in the experimental data is at present contradictory .    in this work ,",
    "we assume following ref .  @xcite that uhecrs with @xmath2  ev are mostly extragalactic protons and compare the theoretical predictions for their energy spectrum to experimental data .",
    "several groups of authors have tried previously to explain the observed spectral shape of uhecr flux using mainly two different approaches : in the first one , the ankle is identified with the transition from a steep galactic , usually iron - dominated component to extragalactic protons with injection spectrum between @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite . in the second approach , the dip is a feature of @xmath10 pair production and one is able to fit the uhecr spectrum down to @xmath11  ev using only extragalactic protons and an injection spectrum between @xmath12 and @xmath1  @xcite . the first possibility is not very predictive and probably in contradiction to the observed isotropy of the uhecr flux  @xcite , while for the second one an explanation for the complex spectrum suggested ad - hoc by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite is missing .",
    "moreover , an injection spectrum @xmath13 with @xmath14 is considerably steeper than @xmath15 predicted by shock acceleration  @xcite .",
    "a basic ingredient of all these analyses is the assumption that the sources are identical . in particular",
    ", it is assumed that every source can accelerate protons to the same maximal energy @xmath16 , typically chosen as @xmath17  ev or higher .",
    "however , one expects that @xmath16 differs among the sources and that the number of potential sources becomes smaller and smaller for larger @xmath16 .",
    "therefore two natural questions to ask are i ) can one explain the observed cr spectrum with non - identical sources ? and",
    "ii ) , is in this case a good fit of the cr spectrum possible with @xmath18 as predicted by fermi shock acceleration ?    in this letter , we address these two questions and show that choosing a power - law distribution @xmath19 for @xmath16 allows one to explain the measured energy spectrum e.g.  for @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we assume a continuous distribution of cr sources with constant comoving density up to the maximal redshift @xmath22 .",
    "the flux of sources further away is negligible above @xmath4  ev , the lowest energy considered by us . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the same luminosity for all sources .",
    "then uhecrs are generated according to the injection spectrum e^- ( e_-e ) , [ single ] and are propagated until their energy is below @xmath4  ev or they reach the earth .",
    "the proton propagation was simulated with the monte carlo code of ref .",
    "the maximal energy @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) is usually chosen as @xmath23  ev or larger for identical sources . in this case",
    ", the exact value of @xmath16 influences only the uhecr flux above @xmath24  ev , i.e. the strength of the gzk suppression , while the flux at lower energies is independent from @xmath16 .",
    "the shape of the observed energy spectrum between @xmath25  ev and the gzk cutoff can be well explained by the modification of the power - law injection spectrum through the energy losses of extragalactic protons due to pion and @xmath6 pair production on cosmic microwave photons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can reproduce both the hires data  @xcite and the akeno / agasa data ( below @xmath26  ev ) with @xmath27 , cf .",
    "figs . 1 , 2 and refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to combine the agasa  @xcite with the akeno  @xcite data in fig .  2 , we have rescaled systematically the agasa data 10% downwards in energy which is well within the uncertainty of the absolute energy scale of agasa  @xcite .",
    "the use of a power - law for the injection spectrum of uhecrs is well - motivated by models of shock acceleration  @xcite .",
    "however , these models predict as exponent typically @xmath282.2 . moreover , the maximal acceleration energy of a certain source depends obviously on parameters that vary from source to source like its magnetic field strength or its size  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects that @xmath16 varies vastly among different sources with less and less sources able to accelerate cosmic rays to the high - energy end of the spectrum .    here",
    ", we propose to use more realistic source models for the calculation of the energy spectrum expected from extragalactic protons .",
    "we relax the assumption of identical sources and suggest to use a power - law distribution for the maximal energies of the individual sources , e_^- .",
    "[ e_max ] without concrete models for the sources of uhecrs , we can not derive the exact form of the distribution of @xmath16 values .",
    "however , the use of a power - law for the @xmath16 distribution is strongly motivated by the following two reasons : first , we expect a monotonically decreasing distribution of @xmath16 values and , for the limited range of two energy decades we consider , a power - law distribution should be a good approximation to reality .",
    "second , the use of a power - law distribution for @xmath16 with exponent = + 1-_0 , [ index ] guaranties to recover the spectra calculated with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , i.e.@xmath29  const . , for the special case of @xmath30 and a continous distribution of sources . in eq .",
    "( [ index ] ) , @xmath31 denotes the exponent of the injection spectrum of an individual source and @xmath32 the exponent of the effective injection spectrum after averaging over the @xmath16 distribution of individual sources .",
    "for instance , an injection spectrum of single sources with @xmath20 characteristic for fermi shock acceleration reproduces effectively together with a distribution of @xmath16 values with @xmath21 the case @xmath33 found assuming identical sources . for finite values of @xmath16 and the source density @xmath34",
    ", the effective injection spectrum is not described anymore by a single power - law .",
    "however , deviations show - up only at energies above @xmath35  ev or small source densities , see below .",
    "the results for 5.000 monte carlo runs of our simulation are presented in fig .",
    "[ hires_fit ] for hires and in fig .",
    "[ agasa_fit ] for akeno / agasa . in the standard picture of uniform sources with identical maximal energy ( here , @xmath23  ev ) and @xmath3 spectrum ,",
    "extragalactic sources contribute only to a few bins of the spectrum around the gzk cutoff , cf . the green - dotted line in fig .  [ hires_fit ] .",
    "by contrast , an injection spectrum @xmath1 allows one to explains the observed data down to @xmath36  ev with extragalactic protons from identical sources , cf . the magenta , dash - dotted line for a continuous and the blue , dashed line for a finite source distribution with @xmath37 in fig",
    ".  [ hires_fit ] . this well - known result can be obtained also for an injection spectrum @xmath3 of individual sources , if for the @xmath16 distribution , eq .  ( [ e_max ] ) , the exponent @xmath21 is chosen .",
    "this is illustrated by the red , solid line in fig .",
    "[ hires_fit ] for the case of a finite source density @xmath37 .",
    "as already announced , only small differences at the highest energies , @xmath38  ev , are visible between an effective @xmath33 produced by an suitable @xmath16 distribution and the case of identical sources with @xmath27 for large enough @xmath34 .    in fig .",
    "[ agasa_fit ] , we show the dependence of our results on the source density @xmath34 together with the akeno / agasa data . while for large enough source densities , @xmath37 , the spectra from identical sources with @xmath1 and from sources with @xmath3 injection spectrum , variable @xmath16 and @xmath21 are very similar , for smaller densities , @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ agasa_fit ] , the shape of the spectra differs considerably even at lower energies .",
    "thus for small source densities , the best - fit parameter for @xmath31 and the quality of the fit has to be determined for each combination of @xmath40 and @xmath34 separately and the relation ( [ index ] ) is not valid anymore .    from our results presented in figs .",
    "[ hires_fit ] and  [ agasa_fit ] , we conclude that the power - law injection spectrum @xmath1 found earlier may be seen as a the combined effect of an injection spectrum @xmath3 predicted by fermi acceleration and a power - law distribution of the maximal energies of individual sources with @xmath21 , if the source density is sufficiently large , @xmath41 .",
    "more generally , the exponent @xmath32 obtained from fits assuming identical sources is connected simply by eq .",
    "( [ index ] ) to the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath40 determining the power - laws of variable sources in this regime .",
    "the minimal model we proposed can explain the observed uhecr spectrum for @xmath42  ev with an injection spectrum as predicted by fermi acceleration mechanism , @xmath202.2 . however , in general the experimental data can be fitted for any value of @xmath31 in the range @xmath43 by choosing an appropriate index @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ e_max ] ) .",
    "the best - fit injection spectrum with @xmath27 found for @xmath29  const .",
    "appears in our model as an effective value that takes into account the averaging over the distribution of @xmath16 values for various sources .    as in the standard case of identical sources",
    ", we can not explain the agasa excess at @xmath45  ev in our model .",
    "both injection spectra @xmath1 and @xmath3 do not fit well the last three agasa bins above @xmath26  ev ; they have @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the shape of the dip can be used also in our model to understand the overall energy scale of different experiments as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for completeness",
    ", we consider now the case of sources with variable luminosity .",
    "the total source luminosity can be defined by l(z ) = l_0 ( 1+z)^m ( z_-z ) ( z - z _ ) , [ sources ] where @xmath48 parameterizes the luminosity evolution , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the redshifts of the closest and most distant sources .",
    "sources in the range @xmath51 have a negligible contribution to the uhecr flux above @xmath4  ev .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is connected to the density of sources and influences strongly the shape of bump and the strength of the gzk suppression  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath48 influences the spectrum in the range @xmath52  ev  @xcite , but less strongly than the parameter @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ e_max ] ) .",
    "positive values of @xmath48 increase the contribution of high - redshift sources and , as a result , injection spectra with @xmath53 can fit the observed data even in the case of the same @xmath16 for all sources .",
    "for example , @xmath54 and @xmath55 fits the agasa and hires data as well as @xmath27 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "however , a good fit with @xmath20 requires a unrealistic strong redshift evolution of the sources , @xmath58 .",
    "we have presented fits of our model only to the data of akeno / agasa and hires .",
    "similar fits can be done for the first results of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite or the older data of the yakutsk experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainty of these data sets is ( still ) too large , and at present no further insight can be gained from these data . in the future , data of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and the telescope array  @xcite will restrict the parameter space of theoretical models similar to one presented here . if a clustered component or even individual sources can be identified in the future data , their spectra will allow one to distinguish between different possibilities for the injection spectrum .",
    "intriguingly , the energy spectrum of the clustered component found by the agasa experiment is much steeper than the overall spectrum  @xcite .",
    "thus , one might speculate this steeper spectrum is the first evidence for the `` true '' injection spectrum of uhecr sources .",
    "in this letter we have argued that the assumption that all uhecr sources accelerate to the same maximal energy is both unrealistic and unnecessary .",
    "abandoning the idea of identical sources and introducing a power - law distribution for the maximal energy of uhecr sources allows one to fit the cr spectrum above @xmath4  ev with the canonical @xmath3 spectrum predicted by fermi acceleration introducing @xmath40 as one additional , physically well - motivated parameter .",
    "the exponent @xmath27 of the best - fit injection spectrum for identical sources appears in or model only as an effective parameter , determined by the exponents from the `` true '' injection spectrum and from the distribution of @xmath16 values .",
