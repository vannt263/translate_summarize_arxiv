    "there have been sincere hopes that the inverse tully - fisher ( tf ) relation could overcome the distance dependent selection bias , the so - called malmquist bias of the 2nd kind ( teerikorpi @xcite ) , influencing the determination of the value of the hubble constant .",
    "first , schechter ( @xcite ) pointed out that the inverse relation of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is absolute magnitude ( or linear diameter ) and @xmath5 is an observable parameter not affected by selection effects ( e.g.  the maximum rotation velocity @xmath0 in the tf relation ) , can be derived even from magnitude limited samples in an unbiased manner .",
    "secondly , teerikorpi ( 1984 , or @xcite ) showed explicitly that the inverse relation gives unbiased average distances for a sample of galaxies ( if @xmath5 is not affected by selection ) , a result later confirmed by tully ( @xcite ) via simulations ( see also hendry & simmons @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , ekholm & teerikorpi ( 1997 , or @xcite ) showed that with the inverse relation , one does not necessarily need a volume - limited calibrator sample , which on the contrary is quite critical for the use of the direct relation : @xmath6 the direct tf relation has been succesfully applied for derivation of @xmath2 by the method of normalized distances that was first used by bottinelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have used an improved version of this method in an analysis of a sample of 5171 spiral galaxies that leads to the value of @xmath7 . in this method , which is rather similar to the spaenhauer diagram method of sandage ( @xcite )",
    ", one identifies the so - called unbiased plateau in the @xmath8 vs.  normalized distance diagram for a magnitude or angular diameter limited sample , from which @xmath2 is determined without the need to make further model dependent correction due to selection .",
    "normally , the unbiased plateau contains only 10 - 20 percent of the total sample . that one can use the whole sample without bias correction",
    "is a remarkable advantage of the inverse relation approach .",
    "however , several problems balance the advantages of the inverse relation ( fouqu et al .",
    "@xcite , teerikorpi @xcite , sandage et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , and one has not yet been able to use it reliably for an independent determination of @xmath2 ( see theureau @xcite , ekholm et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we study two important points which must be clarified before a successful use of the inverse tf relation :    1 .   how would possible cutoffs in @xmath0 be seen in the data ? 2 .",
    "how large an influence do upper and lower cutoffs in @xmath0 have on derived average distances ( and hence on @xmath2 ) ? 3 .",
    "how does the nature of the calibrator sample influence the derived average distances if the inverse tf slopes for calibrators and field galaxies differ ?",
    "as regards the first point , we emphasize that our approach follows the lines which we have adopted and found useful with the direct tf relation : to detect and overcome the bias without detailed modeling , by studying how the cutoffs would appear in kinematical applications ( c.f .",
    "the increase of @xmath9 as a function of true ( or normalized ) distance , when the direct tf relation is used ) .",
    "another , more technical approach to the direct tf relation is that of willick ( @xcite ) , based on corrections to individual galaxies within an iterative scheme . in principle , a good knowledge of the @xmath0 selection function could also permit willick s method to work for the inverse tf relation , in order to derive the slope as it would be without the selection .",
    "our approach necessarily cuts away a part of the sample .",
    "however , as shown by ekholm et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the klun sample , the remaining subsample suitable for the determination of @xmath2 with the inverse tf method is still much larger than the unbiased subsample for the direct tf relation .",
    "the observational motivation for studying question 2 ) comes from theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who discuss the detection rate of 21 cm line profiles at the nanay radio telescope , in connection with the angular size limited klun galaxy sample .",
    "the detection rate is relatively high , 86 percent for galaxies with a previous redshift measurement and 61 percent for those with unknown @xmath10 .",
    "however , more important than the average detection rate , is _ how detection depends on @xmath5 , i.e.  the selection function @xmath11_. unfortunately this is difficult to derive from the raw data .",
    "theureau ( @xcite ) notes that one expects loss of galaxies with either a narrow or broad 21 cm line width .",
    "narrow profiles are difficult to detect among the noise , while broad profiles , being low , also tend to be missed .",
    "hence , as a first approximation we suppose that the distribution of @xmath0 is affected by sharp lower and upper cutoffs , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , although the selection @xmath11 more probably depends on various galactic parameters in a complicated manner .",
    "how such cutoffs influence , e.g.  the value of @xmath2 as determined by the inverse relation method , has not been previously _",
    "quantitatively _ discussed .",
    "we study the above questions using normal distributions , which allow analytic expressions .",
    "this forms a natural sequel to our previous discussions of the tf relations , both direct and inverse , where the assumption of gaussianity has been adopted ( teerikorpi 1984 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that though we occasionally refer to the klun sample ( see e.g.  theureau et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the theoretical ideas concerning the above mentioned points 13 have general validity . as an extensive sequel to the present work , ekholm et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have investigated whether the large value of @xmath2 , derived with a straightforward application of the inverse tf relation for the klun sample , could be due to the errors arising from cutoff and/or calibrator sample biases .",
    "they show that the calibrator sample bias is more important .",
    "in this paper we also aim at a better general understanding of the inverse relation as a distance indicator , and present some arguments in a heuristic manner , since the method has been justly criticised as difficult to visualize , in comparison with the `` more natural '' direct relation approach .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we show qualitatively how cutoffs in @xmath0 influence the distance determination . in sect .",
    "3 the method of normalized distance @xmath14 is introduced for the inverse tf relation . in sect .  4",
    ", the behaviour in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath14 diagram is calculated analytically . in sect .  5",
    ", we derive an analytical expression for the average bias in @xmath15 when there is an upper or lower cutoff in @xmath0 , and give some examples in sect .  6 .",
    "the fundamental problems of slope and calibration are discussed in sects .  7 and 8 .",
    "section 9 contains concluding remarks , emphasizing the essential points and consequences of the present study .    a note on the nomenclature : we use capital @xmath16 s for the diameter of a galaxy , @xmath17 is the usual apparent 25th - mag isophotal diameter ( @xmath18=0.1 $ ] arcmin )",
    ", @xmath16 is the linear diameter ( @xmath19=$ ] kpc ) . in sect .  4 , to make the formulae more readable , we use @xmath20 for the @xmath21 s .",
    "small @xmath22 s are used for inferred distances , @xmath14 is the normalized and @xmath23 the kinematical distance .",
    "it is assumed that kinematical distances have been calculated from a realistic velocity field model , giving reliable relative distances ( in practice from a virgo - centric infall model as e.g.  in theureau et al .",
    "the true distance is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "let us assume that the selection may be described as cutoffs on the wings of the symmetric @xmath5 distribution . to illustrate ,",
    "let us consider the simple case when there is only an upper cutoff @xmath13 , so that all @xmath25 are missed , while all @xmath26 are measured .",
    "the situation is sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "the calibrator sample ( at a fixed distance ) is on the right , while a distant cluster of galaxies is on the left .",
    "the @xmath13-limit is indicated by a dotted line .",
    "the correct regression lines , with the same slopes , are shown .",
    "note that unaware of the @xmath5 selection , one would derive from the cluster galaxies ( or more generally from field galaxies ) a too shallow slope . for the moment we simply assume that the correct slope is known .",
    "we return to the problem of slope in sect .  7 , and this issue will be discussed elsewhere ( ekholm et al.@xcite ) in connection with real data .    in inverse tf method ( itf ) for deriving distances ,",
    "one basically shifts one of the regression lines over the other , and the required shift of @xmath27 gives the ( logarithmic ) ratio of cluster to calibrator distance .    in practice ,",
    "one calculates for each cluster galaxy the itf `` distance '' @xmath28 using the calibrating relation @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "averaging over all cluster galaxies gives the unbiased distance .",
    "this is equivalent to `` shifting the regression lines '' .",
    "the itf `` distance '' has a systematic error depending on @xmath5 , though one does not know how large the error is ( c.f .",
    "sect .  5 in @xcite ) .    in the depicted situation ,",
    "even if one knows the correct slope , the attempt to force - fit it on the cluster data will shift the line towards larger @xmath27 , because the upper cutoff has eliminated more galaxies from above the `` correct '' ( unbiased ) regression line than from below it .",
    "hence , the inevitable result of an upper cutoff is that the itf distance to the cluster will be underestimated .",
    "now , because of the limiting angular size , not all galaxies of the cluster are included .",
    "so one should add to the diagram a vertical line , only galaxies to the right of which are large enough to enter the sample .",
    "note that this cutoff does not bias the distance indicator if there is no @xmath5-cutoff .",
    "if one moves the cluster closer ( to the right ) , the angular size limit cuts away less of the cluster galaxies .",
    "then the influence of the @xmath13-cutoff on the derived distances becomes weaker . in terms of the calculated hubble constant ( actually up to an unknown factor , because @xmath31 is still unknown ) , one should see in a @xmath15 vs.  @xmath23 diagram first at small kinematical distances ( proportional to the true ones ) a constant `` plateau '' when the angular size limit keeps out of the cluster .",
    "then there is an increase due to the larger influence of the @xmath13-cutoff .",
    "the plateau in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath23 diagram is not an unbiased plateau ; it still gives too large a value of @xmath32 , because of a residual effect of the @xmath13-limit .",
    "the bias can be reduced by applying an upper cutoff to the cluster sample in @xmath27 , as illustrated by the dashed vertical line in fig .  1 .",
    "the galaxies between the upper and lower @xmath27 cutoffs now provide the best itf distance estimate .    the position of the critical righthand side vertical line in fig .  1 , which cuts away the `` bad '' @xmath27 interval , depends on the distance of the cluster ( compare the cluster and the calibrators )",
    ". however , its position is practically constant on the _ linear size scale _ , independently of the cluster distance .",
    "this is clearly seen if one shifts in fig .  1 the cluster galaxies to the right , i.e.  decreases their distance until it coincides with the distance of the calibrator cluster .",
    "because the tf relations are essentially the same , the critical vertical lines will almost coincide .",
    "hence , in the general case of a field galaxy sample , one may shift all galaxies independent of their distances , to one diagram of @xmath0 vs. @xmath33 , where the abscissa is up to an unknown constant ( as far as @xmath2 is unknown ) the same as linear diameter , @xmath21 .",
    "if one now accepts galaxies left of the ( common ) critical line only , an unbiased average distance is derived .",
    "one might term @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) the normalized distance , analogously to the case of the direct tf normalized distance introduced in @xcite . then in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath35 diagram , using the correct slope @xmath36 , there is at small normalized distances an unbiased plateau , after which @xmath8 starts to grow .",
    "the resulting unbiased plateau should be horizontal , if the slope @xmath36 is correct .",
    "@xcite pointed out a simple device of deciding which is the correct inverse slope :   in the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath23 diagram the run of points should be horizontal .",
    "this was , however , made under the premise of no @xmath5-selection .",
    "now we understand that instead of @xmath23 one should use @xmath37 on the abscissa , in order to identify the cutoff @xmath14 .",
    "only galaxies below this cutoff are expected to show a horizontal run on the @xmath15 vs.  @xmath23 diagram , if @xmath36 is correct .",
    "figure 2 shows how in the more general case , the lower cutoff causes too small @xmath8 below the unbiased plateau .",
    "ekholm et al .",
    "@xcite will discuss the evidence for upper and lower cutoffs in @xmath0 in the klun sample and how the described method can in practice be implemented .",
    "though in this manner one may detect sharp cutoffs in @xmath0 and derive an unbiased value of @xmath2 without detailed modelling , it is important to know how large an influence the cutoffs would have on @xmath2 , if their presence were ignored .",
    "we discuss this in sects .",
    "assuming gaussian distributions and sharp cutoffs at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , it is easy to calculate the expected run of @xmath8 vs.  normalized distance @xmath14 . for simplicity , we write the inverse relation as @xmath38we use @xmath39 as shorthand notation for the logarithm of the linear diameter . at any fixed @xmath20",
    "the dispersion of @xmath5 is @xmath40 .",
    "now the task is to calculate the bias in @xmath15 at each @xmath20 .",
    "this is done starting from the same initial formula ( 28 ) of @xcite which was used to show the absence of bias . however , in this case one must add the selection function @xmath11 : @xmath41where @xmath42}$ ] and @xmath43 .",
    "this formula gives for the sample galaxies with true ( log ) diameter @xmath20 , the ( log ) error in the diameter deduced by the inverse relation ( using @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is directly reflected to the derived value of @xmath8 at constant @xmath20 ( i.e. , at fixed normalized distance @xmath45 ) .    with the present choice of the selection function ( sharp upper and lower cutoffs ) , and after a change of variable , @xmath46eq .",
    "( 4 ) becomes @xmath47here the term @xmath48 can be evaluated in terms of the error function @xmath49 : @xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the cutoffs @xmath12 and @xmath13 via eq .",
    "inspection of the formula confirms the qualitative conclusions of sect.2 .",
    "putting @xmath53 , so that only the upper cutoff remains ( and recalling that @xmath54 ) , the bias is seen to be positive : the diameters are underestimated , leading to underestimated distances , hence to overestimated @xmath15 .",
    "note that this calculation does not tell us the average bias in the sample .",
    "in order to have an idea of how large an influence the @xmath5-cutoffs have on the value of @xmath8 calculated from the whole sample using a ( correct ) inverse relation , we derive the average bias for a special case of radial space density behaviour : @xmath55 where @xmath24 is the radial distance from our galaxy and @xmath56 corresponds to homogeneity . it is easy to understand that the average bias depends on how the observed galaxies are distributed along the @xmath14-axis , which must depend on how galaxies are distributed in space .    rather than trying to start with averaging the derived @xmath57 over @xmath14 ( eq .  6 )",
    ", we use another route , based on the fact that the bivariate distribution @xmath58 is known for an angular diameter limited sample , when space density behaves as eq .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the cosmic distribution of @xmath5 ( as well as of @xmath20 ) is normal , which is a rough approximation for fixed hubble types , see e.g.  fig .  1 in theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    as illustrated by fig .  1 in @xcite for the case of magnitude tf relation , in magnitude and volume limited samples the direct regression lines are parallel and separated by @xmath59 ( when @xmath56 )",
    ". the separation happens so that the volume - limited line ( carrying with it the bivariate distribution ) glides along the unchanged inverse line which goes through the average @xmath4 of both the volume ( @xmath60 ) and magnitude limited ( @xmath61 ) bivariate distributions .",
    "figure 3 gives a similar diagram for the diameter tf relation , showing the three kinds of regression lines for a synthetic sample of field galaxies .    in the present calculation",
    "we need to know how the diameter direct relation is constructed from the parameters defining the itf ( c.f .",

    "16 ) is contained in @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which show how far away from the malmquist - shifted average @xmath70 the cutoffs are , in terms of the dispersion @xmath77 of the cosmic ( gaussian ) distribution function of @xmath5 .",
    "the factor before @xmath48 can also be written in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79such an analytic calculation is possible only in the given special cases of space density .",
    "generally , the distribution of points in the @xmath5 vs.  @xmath35 diagram will differ from the gaussian bivariate case : at each @xmath5 , the shift of @xmath80 will be due to different malmquist biases of the 1st kind .",
    "however , even in this case the inverse relation is not affected and the calculation and prediction of sect .",
    "3 is valid .",
    "we are interested in seeing how large an effect on @xmath15 cutoffs of different severities have .",

    "the average bias clearly depends on the average of @xmath90 .",
    "this is actually the malmquist bias of the 1st kind for gaussian distribution of diameters with dispersion @xmath91 , and in the case of a space density distribution @xmath92 one gets : @xmath93when @xmath56 the distribution is homogeneous . in order to use this as a correction",
    ", one must know both @xmath87 and @xmath36 . clearly , if the field and calibrator slopes are identical , then @xmath8 is unbiased , and this is so irrespective of the nature of the calibrator sample .",
    "note also that this formula contains the width @xmath91 of the total diameter function , not the smaller dispersion @xmath94 .",
    "hence the effect can be formidable even when the slopes @xmath87 and @xmath36 do not differ very much .    as a concrete example ,",
    "consider the klun field galaxies following the inverse slope @xmath95 which is in agreement with the simple disk model of theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this slope , when forced through the calibrators , gives @xmath96 .",
    "above it was noted that the calibrator sample can not represent the cosmic distribution of @xmath0 , and this is the situation when a too high @xmath2 is derived if the actual slope is steeper than the slope from the field galaxies .",
    "it is natural to ask , how large a slope @xmath97 would in this manner explain the difference between @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "taking @xmath100 , we get predicted @xmath101 for different slopes @xmath97 as given in table 2 .",
    "the last column corresponds to a decrease in the average space density , corresponding to density @xmath102 as derived by teerikorpi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it may be concluded that in order to explain the difference between @xmath103 and 55 solely in this manner , it is required that actually @xmath104 0.65  0.75 , instead of @xmath105 .",
    "ekholm et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that such a steep calibrator slope really is consistent with the data .",
    "in the present study we have searched for answers to a few basic questions concerning the inverse tf relation as a distance indicator . _ first _ , how to see the signature of observational incompleteness in the tf parameter @xmath0 , analogously to the well - known increase in @xmath15 at increasing ( normalized ) distance , in the case of the direct tf relation ?",
    "_ secondly _ , in which sense and how _ significant _ is the influence of the @xmath0 incompleteness alone on the derived value of @xmath15 ( supposing one knows the correct inverse tf slope ) ?",
    "_ thirdly _ , how to work with the situation when the inverse slope obeyed by the calibration sample differs from the relevant slope for the field sample ( or for a cluster ) , and how important is in this regard the nature of the calibration sample ?",
    "we have generalized the `` fine - tuning '' scheme discussed by @xcite , and have pointed out that there is a useful @xmath15 vs.  @xmath14 representation for the inverse relation , revealing both the relevant inverse slope and cutoffs in @xmath0 . here @xmath14 is the normalized distance applicable to the inverse tf relation , actually the ( log ) linear diameter within an unknown constant .",
    "we have derived simple analytical formulae which give the influence of the @xmath0 cutoffs on derived average distance ( hence , on @xmath15 ) .",
    "the treatment is based on gaussian distributions , and , in the case of the average bias , on the assumption that the space density is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "the probable case that there is an upper observational cutoff in @xmath0 , would cause an overestimated value of @xmath2 .",
    "however , this effect is not at all dramatic  even if the upper cutoff excludes half of the galaxies , @xmath2 would be increased typically by only 14 percent .",
    "it may be concluded that a cutoff in @xmath0 can not alone explain derived large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the problems of the relevant inverse tf slope and the nature of the calibrator sample lead to serious consequences on the use of the inverse tf relation as a distance indicator .",
    "it has been previously realized that the inverse slope @xmath36 applicable to the field sample is not necessarily the same as the slope @xmath97 obeyed by the calibrators , which may result in a biased value of @xmath2 ( teerikorpi @xcite ) . in the present paper , such situations were systematically studied .",
    "if the two slopes are the same ( in practice , when accuracies of calibrator distances are high and the photometric measurements for the field sample are not less accurate than those for the calibrators ) , then there is no bias , and it is also true that the nature of the calibrator sample ( volume - limited , magnitude - limited , etc . ) is not important ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the sample inverse slope @xmath36 is shallower than the calibrator slope ( as normally expected ) , then matters come to depend critically on the nature of the calibrator sample .",
    "first , there is the possibility that the calibrator sample is a true , volume - limited representation of the gaussian cosmic distribution function of @xmath0 from which the field sample has been taken ( the latter subject only to malmquist bias ) . in this ideal case",
    ", it is permitted to use the field sample slope , with the zero - point obtained by a force - fit through the calibrators .",
    "this was the solution suggested by teerikorpi ( @xcite ) , and in this case it is not necessary to know the value of the calibrator slope .",
    "however , generally the calibrator sample s @xmath107 is shifted from the cosmic @xmath108 .",
    "if one knows the shift @xmath109 ( or @xmath110 ) _ and _ the slopes @xmath97 and @xmath36 , then one may calculate the resulting error in @xmath15 , when the field sample s @xmath36 is used .",
    "the systematic error is given by eq .",
    "( 25 ) .",
    "another , more convenient route , which bypasses the explicit need for @xmath109 , is to use the calibrators slope @xmath87 ( and corresponding zero - point ) and to calculate analytically the resulting systematic error in terms of the malmquist bias of the 1st kind .",
    "this assumes that the average space number density around us is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "the systematic error is given by eq .",
    "( 27 ) .",
    "we repeat that in the general case both @xmath87 and @xmath36 ( with corresponding zero - points from force - fits through calibrators ) result in erroneous average distance estimates .",

    "<S> analytical expressions , under the simplifying assumption of a normal distribution and the use of the correct tf slope , are derived for the resulting biases , especially the average bias which @xmath0 cutoffs produce in the derived value of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this bias is shown to be relatively weak , and as such can not explain the large differences in the reported values of @xmath2 derived from direct and inverse tf relations .    </S>",
    "<S> some problems of slope and calibration are shown to be more serious . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one consequence of fitting through the calibrators either the slope relevant for field galaxies or the steeper slope followed by calibrators is that the derived value of the hubble constant comes to depend on the nature of the calibrator sample . </S>",
    "<S> if the calibrator sample is not representative of the cosmic distribution of @xmath0 , large errors in the derived value of @xmath2 are possible . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions are given for this error that we term the calibrator sample bias . </S>"
