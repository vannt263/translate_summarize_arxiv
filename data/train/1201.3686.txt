    "the nature of the dark matter is presently unknown .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has been very successful in explaining the observed properties of large scale structures of the universe , but on small scales there are still some discrepancies , as the abundance of satellite galaxies falls far short of the number of subhalos predicted ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite and @xcite for a different view ) .",
    "an interesting alternative is the warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenario , where the dark matter particle has a smaller ( a few kev ) mass @xcite . as the growth of structure below the free - streaming scale of the wdm",
    "was quenched , such a model predicts much fewer small halos , but on large scales its prediction is similar to the cdm case and could still match the large scale structure observations very well @xcite .    the abundance of small halos may also greatly affect the reionization of the universe .",
    "as the stars and galaxies form at the end of the cosmic dark age , the star light ionizes the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , causing the later to ionize . eventually , all of hydrogen gas in the igm is ionized , this is the so called ( hydrogen ) reionization . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "most of these ionizing photons would come from dwarf galaxies in small halos . in recent years",
    ", the gunn - peterson trough in the lyman alpha absorption spectrum of high redshift quasars has been observed , indicating that we are approaching the end stage of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy observation is another important source of information about eor @xcite .",
    "the recent wmap analysis gives the redshift of completion of reionization as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this result can be used to constrain the properties of dark matters . in the wdm model ,",
    "halos of a given mass would typically form later than in the cdm model , so the initiation of the eor would be delayed .",
    "also , as the formation of small halos which are most common during the eor are suppressed , fewer ionizing photons are produced , and it was believed that this would delay the completion of the reionization significantly @xcite .    it should be noted that in some wdm models , the wdm particle may be able to decay , which ionizes and heats up the igm @xcite .",
    "this ( and the annihilation of some cdm particles ) in itself is an interesting problem with rich physics involved ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the effect on reionization is fairly complicated , for example , the free electrons produced in the dark age could help catalyze the formation of molecule hydrogen , making it possible to form first stars and start reionization early in this case @xcite , though the magnitude and significance of this effect is highly uncertain@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we shall limit ourselves to the passive wdm model , and shall not consider such effects .",
    "however , the time it took the reionization process to complete depends not only on the supply rate but also on the consumption rate of the ionizing photons . after being ionized",
    ", the atoms of the igm gas will recombine , and to keep the gas ionized more ionizing photons have to be consumed . as the recombination rate is proportional to",
    "the density squared , at the later stage of the eor the minihalos could potentially consume the majority of the ionizing photons @xcite . in the wdm scenario ,",
    "the number of minihalos are much fewer , so the global recombination rate could be significantly lower .",
    "when this is considered , it is not obvious whether the wdm would delay or advance the completion of the eor .",
    "we use the bubble model of reionization @xcite to investigate the reionization process in the wdm scenario , take into account both the reduction in photon production rate and the consumption rate due to the suppression on halo formation in wdm models . here we adopt the wmap 5 years cosmology parameters ( the wmap 7 years parameters are almost identical ) : @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "note that for the wdm model , this set of parameters may not be the best fit values , but to illustrate the physical effect of different dark matter mass , we have used the same parameters for all models .",
    "we calculate the halo mass function in the wdm model analytically by following the prescription of @xcite . in the wdm model ,",
    "the free - streaming comoving scale is given by @xmath3 and the corresponding mass is @xmath4 . the halo mass function",

    "we see the abundance of dark matter halos on small scales are significantly suppressed , while on large scales the halo abundance are almost the same as the cdm model . on the same plot , we also mark the mass range of what we call the `` minihalos '' , i.e. halos which are sufficiently massive to accrete the gas , but not massive enough for the gas to cool by atomic h and form galaxies@xcite .",
    "= 10 , 2  kev ( dashed , dashed - dotted ) respectively at z=15 .",
    "we marked the minihalos mass range by two thin dashed vertical lines . ]",
    "we now consider the reionization process in the wdm model . at the end of the dark age ,",
    "dark matter halos form from primordial overdense perturbations , and in halos of sufficient masses , the gas cooled radiatively and contracted to dense clumps which eventually form the first stars . at present , it is still unclear whether the first stars formed in halos which were cooled by the trace amount of molecule hydrogen in the gas ( @xmath11 ) , or only in more massive halos which were cooled by atomic hydrogen ( @xmath12 ) @xcite . in either case , the stars and galaxies tend to form more abundantly in overdense regions , so the ionized regions first appeared as `` bubbles '' in such regions .",
    "as more and more bubbles appeared and grew in size , eventually the ionized regions overlapped , thus completing the reionization .    inspired by numerical simulation results ,",
    "a popular analytical model of the process called the `` bubble model '' has been developed @xcite . according to this model",
    ", the reionization proceeds by first forming ionized bubbles , the number and size of these bubbles continue to grow till they overlap with each other , thus complete the reionization process .",
    "the formation of the ionized bubbles is determined by the condition that the number of ionizing photons produced within the given region exceeds the total number of atoms to be ionized in the same region .",
    "if we assume that each collapsed baryon on average contribute @xmath13 ionizing photons , with each photon ionizes one atom once , and the average number of recombination per atom during that time is @xmath14 , then the condition for the region to be ionized at the given redshift can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fraction of baryons collapsed into star - forming halos .",
    "this treatment of the effect of recombination differs from @xcite .",
    "they considered the limiting case , where the ionizing photon production is required to counteract the recombination at that instant .",
    "our model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_recomb ] ) is more in line with the original bubble model , in which the total integrated number of ionizing photons is considered .",
    "in such a model , one assumes that halos with the virial masses above a certain threshold value could form stars .",
    "the collapse fraction can then be calculated with the extended press - schechter method @xcite . during the early eor , the pop iii stars formed in the molecule hydrogen cooled halos may have played an important role , these halos are much less massive than the typical star - forming halos during the eor , which are cooled by atomic hydrogen or at somewhat later time , by metals . to account for this ,",
    "we may split the contribution into the part from molecule hydrogen cooled halos and the part from more massive halos .",
    "we denote the first type by the subscript `` mol '' , and without danger of confusion , the second type is denoted without any subscript , then the condition eq.([eq : f_recomb ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath17    a molecule hydrogen cooled halo should have a virial temperature of at least @xmath18 for this mechanism to work .",
    "furthermore , the formation of the molecules is strongly modulated by the lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation background .",
    "for the molecules to form , the mass of the halo should be greater than @xcite @xmath19 the mass threshold is then given by @xmath20.\\ ] ] we model the lw intensity as @xmath21 with @xmath22 the first term represents a slowly - evolving component due to pop iii stars whose formation is self - regulated , while the second term comes from the more massive , atomically cooled halos . strictly speaking , for the wdm model",
    "the formation of pop iii stars is suppressed , so the coefficient of the first term would be smaller , but this change would not affect the final result , as the contribution of the few stars in wdm model is very small anyway .",
    "the molecule cooled halo collapse fraction is then calculated with @xmath23    the value of @xmath13 and @xmath24 depends on a number of factors , e.g. the fraction of baryons in the halo which ended up in stars , the energy released by the star during its lifetime , and the fraction of the photons which escaped to the igm from the cloud surrounding the star .",
    "there are currently large uncertainties on this parameter . here",
    "we adopt @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 , the latter parameter value is in agreement with the properties of massive metal - free stars given in . with these parameter values ,",
    "@xmath27 during the pop iii stars dominated stage in the cdm model , in well agreement with the value widely adopted in analytical and numerical studies of first stars @xcite , while at z=10 @xmath28 , very close to the value given in @xcite .    at high redshifts ,",
    "the clustering in the igm is relatively low , we assume that only one photon is needed to ionize an igm atom , while for the atoms in the minihalo the number of recombinations is given by @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the average number of recombinations per atom of the minihalo , @xmath31 is the jeans mass .",
    "the upper limit of the integration @xmath32 is the minimum mass of halos that could host radiation sources , i.e. , pop iii stars or galaxies , that is @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the recombination inside the galaxies should be relegated to the net photon production number @xmath13 and should not be included again here .",
    "earlier analytical estimates typically gave @xmath34 @xcite , in which case the recombination of the minihalos would consume the majority of photons at the late stage of eor .",
    "however , numerical simulation of the ionizing front passing through minihalos shows that the number of actual recombinations may be far smaller , e.g. , at z=15 , @xmath35 for halos with mass below @xmath36 and irradiated by typical ionizing flux @xcite . as the halo is ionized , it is heated and the gas expands , causing the density to decrease and recombination rate quickly lowered , and thus the recombination rate is much lower than the earlier estimates .",
    "we adopt the @xmath30 value differs by one from @xcite : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the value given in @xcite . ]",
    "derived from @xcite and @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ nrec ] ) , for a bubble with mass @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are both functions of the linear overdensity of this bubble . by solving the equation @xmath42 , a critical overdensity @xmath43 is determined .",
    "this is the barrier in the excursion set , regions with linear overdensity above this barrier should be ionized @xcite .",
    "we obtained this barrier by solving the above equation with numerical iterations , and found that it is still well approximated by a linear function of the squared variance of density fluctuation @xmath44 ( the following process is the same as in @xcite ) : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 with this linear barrier , the bubble mass function is expressed analytically by @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the number density of bubbles .",
    "finally , the volume filling factor of all bubbles @xmath50 is calculated directly by integrating over the bubble mass function : @xmath51",
    "we plot the redshift evolution of the ionization volume filling factor in fig .",
    "[ qv_iliev ] . here",
    "we considered four different cases : the reionization in the @xmath52cdm model with and without minihalo recombinations , and the reionization in @xmath52wdm model with minihalo recombinations for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "first we note that as illustrated in the @xmath52cdm case , in the absence of minihalos , the reionization would be completed earlier by as much as @xmath55 , this shows how much impact the minihalo recombinations could have on the reionization .",
    "this is obtained with @xmath30 derived from @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the higher values of @xmath30 given in the earlier literature @xcite , the impact would be even stronger .",
    "in the @xmath52wdm case , the reionization starts later than in the @xmath52cdm cases , as the first stars would form later with the small scale power suppressed in these models .",
    "this difference is most obvious at @xmath56 , when the first stars just begin to form in large numbers . as small scale powers",
    "are suppressed in the @xmath52wdm model , there are very few halos in which the gas could be cooled by molecule hydrogen and form pop iii stars @xcite . instead , in @xmath52wdm most first stars only form in atomically cooled halos , this caused significant difference in the initiation of reionization .",
    "however , it is generally believed that the reionization is due primarily not to the stars formed in the h@xmath57 cooled halos , but to stars formed in the more massive halos at lower redshifts . for the more massive halos ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath58 wdm and the cdm is not so large .",
    "in fact , from the figure we can see that in this case , the bubble filling factor of the @xmath59 wdm model catches up with the cdm model at @xmath60 , and later it even exceeds that of the cdm model , thus the reionization is actually completed earlier than in the cdm case .",
    "this is because at this stage , the ionizing photons are produced mainly in the more massive halos , which is about equally abundant in the 10 kev wdm and cdm cases , while the suppression of minihalos reduced the global recombination rate in the wdm model , making the bubbles overlap earlier .",
    "thus we observe the interesting result that the universe is reionized earlier in the wdm model .",
    "this effect is relatively small compared with the current theoretical and observational uncertainties , especially the mean number of ionizing photons produced by a halo of given mass .",
    "however , it could potentially be useful if these uncertainties are greatly reduced by improvements on observations and theoretical modelings of reionization process .    for",
    "models with still lower wdm masses , the more massive halos are begin to be affected . in the 2  kev wdm model , the star formation associated with the more massive halos",
    "are also suppressed , and the reionization is delayed in that model .",
    "the reduction of photon supply and consumption would be balanced somewhere between these two cases , the exact value would however be dependent on the parameters we adopt , especially the value of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath30 .",
    "the values we adopted here are plausible and non - extreme , with the reionization happen at @xmath61 , in agreement with the wmap constraint . nevertheless , there are large uncertainties in these parameters .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath30 value for the minihalos is greater , as was used in some earlier papers , the effect would be still stronger .",
    "( the solid line ) . on the right side of the figure ,",
    "the open circle represents the result for the cdm model without minihalos , while the filled circle represents the result for the cdm model when the effect of minihalo recombination is taken into account . for comparison ,",
    "the mass scale @xmath62 , where the mass function @xmath63 is @xmath64 of the lcdm value , is also marked on the upper abscissa of the figure .",
    "the shadowed region corresponds to @xmath65 , already excluded by the observations of gunn - peterson trough in @xmath66 quasar absorption line spectra .",

    "we see that below @xmath69 , the reionization redshift is very sensitive to the wdm particle mass . with @xmath70 increases",
    ", the reionization redshift also raises quickly , as was usually assumed for wdm particles .",
    "however , a peak of reionization redshift of @xmath71 is reached at @xmath72 . above this mass ,",
    "the reionization redshift begin to decrease slowly , as the suppression on number of star - forming halos becomes relatively insignificant , while the suppression of minihalos reduced the global recombination rate . as a comparison",
    ", we also plot @xmath73 in the cdm model with and without minihalo recombinations by the filled and open circles respectively .",
    "quasar absorption line studies show that the universe had been reionized at least @xmath74 .",

    "the collapse of halos in the wdm model is generally later than in the cdm model , hence the halo concentration is typically smaller @xcite , as the dark matter halos formed later would reach smaller average densities @xcite .",
    "in addition to the delayed collapse redshift , @xcite pointed out that due to the relic velocities of wdm particles , the core of the halo would be smoother in the wdm case .",
    "these effects could in principle reduce the photon consumption rate of the minihalos .",
    "we have checked this effect by calculation and found that it should only have a very slight influence on our results .",
    "for example , in the @xmath89  kev case , for a halo with @xmath90 at @xmath91 , the density profile of the halo within @xmath92 would be flattened , but outside this core radius the density profile is hardly changed .",
    "the gas density profile changed even less , since even in the cdm model the baryonic gas has pressure and therefore a more smooth distribution .",
    "the larger minihalos contribute more to photon consumption in the wdm model , because the abundance of smaller ones is reduced significantly . in the end",
    ", we find that the change in density profile does not significantly affect the total recombination rate of minihalos .    in the present calculation , we have used the bubble model to treat the reionization process .",
    "the bubble model is of course only an approximate model , though it does reproduce more elaborated simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bubble model only provides a distribution of bubbles at a given redshift , it does not tell us how each individual bubble have grown , so we have made only an _",
    "static _ treatment of the recombination process : we calculated the volume of ionized bubble at a certain redshift , then counted the number of minihalos in this region at that time , and calculated the number of recombinations for these minihalos until they are all photoevaporated .",
    "this treatment might slightly overestimate the number of recombinations , because some of the bubbles are formed by the growth and merger of smaller bubbles which were formed at earlier time , and in these regions the minihalo formation had been suppressed . to check whether the neglecting of bubble growth history would alter our results , we make a simplifying _ ansatz _ of bubble growth .",
    "we assume that for a given bubble at redshift @xmath93 , the different parts of its volume were acquired ( i.e. first ionized ) at different redshifts @xmath94 , and the contribution at @xmath95 is proportional to @xmath96 . with this assumption on bubble growth history",
    ", the suppression on minihalo formation in previously ionized region can be taken into account , and the average number of recombinations within the bubbles is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 on the r.h.s is given by eq .",
    "( [ nrecmhs ] ) .",
    "we then calculate the evolution of @xmath50 with this new recombination number . however , we find that the resulting difference is very small .",
    "this is not surprising , since @xmath99 increases rapidly as redshift decreases , in the calculation of @xmath100 , @xmath101 contributes most to the integration .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested that in the wdm models , unlike the case of the cdm models , the first stars do not necessarily form in halos , but may instead form in filaments .",
    "they also argued that with this new way of star formation , the first stars may have smaller typical mass ( @xmath102 ) , and the global star formation rate could be even higher .",
    "this also raises the interesting possibility that the reionization could occur earlier in the wdm model than in the cdm model .",
    "however , whether this new formation mechanism would indeed work as they proposed is still not completely clear , as it is very difficult to model the star formation process in sufficient resolution at present to really check the outcome of the filament star formation process . here",
    ", we have maintained the standard view , and assumed that the stars formed only in dm halos .",
    "we note that if the stars indeed form in the way suggested by @xcite , the reionization in the wdm model would occur at even higher redshifts , and there is not anything incompatible with the recombination effects we discussed .    in summary",
    ", we find that in wdm models the completion of reionization is not always delayed , in some cases , when the wdm mass is not too low , it could even be advanced due to the reduction of recombination rates .",
    "this effect is relatively small compared to the uncertainties in observation and theoretical models at present .",
    "we also find that for @xmath25 , to be consistent with the observations of gunn - peterson trough in @xmath103 quasar spectra , the mass of dark matter particles should be higher than 1.3  kev .",
    "however , if more ionizing photons were produced and escaped into the igm , the dark matter could be warmer , i.e have smaller mass .",
    "however , for dark matter particles that are less than 0.5  kev , @xmath104 is needed .",
    "this would only be possible if the reionization photons are contributed primarily by metal - free or massive extremely metal - poor stars .",
