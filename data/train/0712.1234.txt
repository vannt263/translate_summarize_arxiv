    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been extremely successful in explaining the data from particle physics experiments .",
    "it is , however , not satisfactory when it comes to cosmology .",
    "one of the puzzles that remain is the amount of cold dark matter in the universe , which has been determined precisely from wmap@xcite : @xmath0 none of the sm particles can be a good candidate for the dark matter . the existence of the dark matter itself points to new physics beyond the sm . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are promising dark matter candidates among various proposals in the literature .",
    "given the natural size of its interactions ( weak interaction ) and natural value of its mass around the tev scale , the wimp relic density is around the observed amount of dark matter without much fine tuning .",
    "recently , the twin higgs mechanism has been proposed as a solution to the little hierarchy problem@xcite .",
    "higgses emerge as pseudo - goldstone bosons once a global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "gauge and yukawa interactions that break the global symmetry give masses to the higgses , with the leading order being quadratically divergent . once an additional discrete symmetry ( twin symmetry ) is imposed , the leading one - loop quadratically divergent terms respect the global symmetry .",
    "thus they do not contribute to the higgs masses .",
    "the higgs masses do obtain one - loop logarithmically divergent contributions , resulting in masses around the electroweak scale when the cutoff is around 5@xmath110 tev .",
    "the twin higgs mechanism can be implemented in left - right models with the discrete symmetry being identified with left - right symmetry@xcite . in the left - right twin higgs ( lrth )",
    "model , several physical higgs bosons remain after the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular , there is an @xmath2 higgs doublet @xmath3 , which only couples to the gauge boson sector due to some additional discrete symmetry .",
    "the lightest particle in its neutral components is stable , therefore a good candidate for wimp dark matter .",
    "the dark matter candidate in the left - right twin higgs model is similar to the one in the inert higgs doublet model ( ihdm)@xcite . in the ihdm , one of the higgs doublets plays the role of the sm higgs doublet , which couples to both the fermion matter sector and the gauge boson sector .",
    "the other higgs doublet , however , only couples to the gauge boson sector similar to @xmath3 in the lrth model .",
    "therefore , it could contain a dark matter candidate .",
    "there are some differences between these two models though , which are relevant for the dark matter studies . in the ihdm ,",
    "the mass for the sm higgs boson is a free parameter , which can be anywhere between 100 gev up to a very large value .",
    "the sm higgs mass in the lrth model , on the other hand , is more constrained .",
    "it depends weakly on other model parameters and is typically between 160 @xmath1 180 gev .",
    "the higgs potential in the lrth model is also more constrained compared to that of the ihdm .",
    "the dominant contributions to the higgs potential in the lrth model come from the one - loop coleman - weinberg ( cw ) potential .",
    "the quartic couplings due to gauge interactions are about the size of @xmath4 , much smaller than typical quartic couplings in the ihdm , in which the natural size is @xmath5 . in the lrth model , however , there are extra heavy states and interactions , which lead to new features in the relic density analysis that are absent in the ihdm .    the relic density analysis of the dark matter in the ihdm has been studied in ref .",
    "their results agree with our analysis .",
    "we have furthermore identified regions of parameter space that have previously been overlooked in ref .",
    "in addition , due to the extra particles and interactions that appear in the lrth model , there are new regions that could produce the right amount of relic density , which are otherwise absent in the ihdm .",

    "[ sec : analysis ] , we present in detail our numerical results for the dark matter relic density .",
    "we discuss two dark matter mass regions : ( a ) low mass region , and ( b ) high mass region , and identify the regions of parameter space in which we obtain the right amount of dark matter relic density . in sec .",

    "@xcite , the global symmetry is @xmath6 , with the diagonal subgroup of @xmath7 gauged .",
    "the twin symmetry which is required to control the quadratic divergences of the higgs mass is identified with the left - right symmetry which interchanges l and r. for the gauge couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 of @xmath2 and @xmath10 , the left - right symmetry implies that @xmath11 .    two higgs fields , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "are introduced and each transforms as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively under the global symmetry .",
    "they can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two component objects which are charged under @xmath19 as    @xmath20    @xmath12 couples to both the gauge boson sector and the fermion sector while @xmath13 couples to the gauge boson sector only ( for reasons discussed below ) .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing a discrete symmetry under which @xmath13 is odd while all other particles are even .",
    "each higgs acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) as ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22 breaking one of the u(4 ) to u(3 ) , respectively .",
    "each yields seven nambu - goldstone bosons and one massive radial mode .",
    "the higgs vevs also break @xmath23 down to the sm @xmath24 .    below the cutoff scale @xmath25 ,",
    "the radial modes are integrated out and the effective theory can be described by a nonlinear sigma model of the 14 goldstone bosons .",
    "we follow the parametrization of the scalar fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "after spontaneous global symmetry breaking , three goldstone bosons are eaten by the massive gauge bosons @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and become their longitudinal components .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , three additional goldstone bosons are eaten by the sm gauge bosons @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "with certain re - parametrizations of the fields , we are left with four higgses that couple to both the fermion sector and the gauge boson sector : one neutral pseudoscalar @xmath30 , a pair of charged scalars @xmath31 , and the sm physical higgs @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , an @xmath2 doublet @xmath33 , which resides in @xmath34 , is charged under an additional discrete parity and couples to the gauge boson sector only .",
    "the left - right discrete symmetry ensures that the global symmetry is respected for the one - loop quadratic order of the higgs potential , and so the quadratically divergent corrections to the masses of the goldstone bosons ( i.e. , the higgses ) are absent .",
    "the sub - leading contribution is only proportional to @xmath35 , for @xmath25 being the cutoff scale .",
    "no severe fine tuning is introduced for @xmath25 of the order of 5@xmath110 tev .",
    "note that in the lrth model , it is necessary to introduce both the higgs fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with a hierarchy between their vevs : @xmath36 .",
    "the reason is that the masses of the heavy gauge bosons , which are proportional to @xmath37 , need be large enough to avoid the constraints from the electroweak precision measurements .",
    "such a large value for @xmath38 does not reintroduce the fine tuning problem for the higgs mass , since the gauge boson contributions to the higgs mass are suppressed by the smallness of the gauge couplings .",
    "the higgs field @xmath13 , however , can not couple to the sm fermions , in particular , the top quark sector .",
    "otherwise , the heavy top quark ( the fermionic top quark partner that is introduced in the lrth model ) obtains a much larger mass of the order of @xmath39 , which could result in a large , dangerous contribution to the higgs mass from the top sector . to avoid this",
    ", a parity is introduced in the model under which @xmath13 is odd while all other fields are even .",
    "this parity thus forbids renormalizable couplings between @xmath13 and fermions , especially the top quark sector .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 couples only to the gauge boson sector , while @xmath12 couples to both the gauge sector and the matter fields . the @xmath2 doublet @xmath3 , which resides in @xmath34 , is also odd under this additional matter parity .",
    "the lightest particle in @xmath3 , typically one of the neutral components , is stable , and therefore constitutes a good dark matter candidate .",

    "numerically , the masses for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are around 200 @xmath1 700 gev for typical values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 in the model .",
    "the small mass splitting between @xmath40 and @xmath41 [ 2nd term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgsmass2 ] ) ] is around a few hundred mev , which is due to electromagnetic interactions that are absent for @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we can introduce a term in the higgs potential @xmath52 which gives additional masses for @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath53 this allows us to vary the mass of the dark matter independently as a free parameter .",
    "however , such a term breaks the left - right symmetry softly .",
    "therefore , it is natural for it not to be much bigger than @xmath54 ( typically between 500 gev and 1500 gev ) .",
    "note that since @xmath55 could have either sign , the total mass for @xmath40 and @xmath41 could be either larger or smaller than the contributions from the cw potential in eqs .",

    "therefore , it could give a potentially dangerous quadratically divergent contribution to the higgs mass .",
    "however , quartic terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 have opposite signs , which ensures the cancellation between the quadratically divergent contribution from the @xmath57 loop and that from the @xmath58 loop .",
    "this leaves only logarithmic contributions which are safe for @xmath73 .",
    "another way to understand this cancellation is that at one - loop level , a four point interaction ( @xmath74 ( both @xmath66 fields flow out ) can not give rise to the operator @xmath75 ( with one @xmath66 flows in and another @xmath66 flows out ) unless there is a mass insertion of @xmath75 to flip the field flow ( see fig .",
