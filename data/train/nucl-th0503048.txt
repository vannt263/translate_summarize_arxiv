    "freeze out ( fo ) is a term referring to the stage of expanding or exploding matter when its constituents ( particles ) loose contact , collisions cease and the local dynamical equilibrium no longer can be maintained . when the local equilibrium is significantly perturbed , the microscopic length and time scales become comparable to the characteristic macroscopic ones and the hydrodynamical approach used to describe the evolution of matter breaks down . in the absence of collisions",
    "the momentum distribution of the particles `` freezes out '' , hence the name kinetic freeze out .",
    "+ the final break - up corresponds to a `` phase - transition '' from an interacting fluid to a non - interacting gas of particles , where the interactions between the constituents ceases suddenly when reaching the `` critical '' fo temperature of the order of the pion mass @xmath0 mev , as first assumed by landau @xcite .",
    "consequently , fo is a discontinuity in space - time represented by a space - time boundary or fo hypersurface , taken at the critical temperature [ i.e. , fo isotherm ] . across such fo hypersurface the properties of matter change suddenly .",
    "we denote the two sides of the fo hypersurface as pre fo and post fo sides .",
    "originally , the post fo distribution function was assumed to be an equilibrated jttner distribution function boosted with the local flow velocity on the actual side of the fo hypersurface .",
    "this approximation and method corresponds to the so - called `` sudden '' fo model by cooper and frye @xcite .",
    "+ the cooper - frye type of fo process is the zero thickness limit of a more realistic , so - called `` gradual '' fo process , where the fo description applies over a finite space - time domain , i.e. fo layer . inside the finite fo layer the properties of the matter change gradually trough interactions , while the frozen out particles are formed and emitted at different `` temperatures '' which correspond to the actual temperature of the interacting matter , gradually during the whole evolution of the matter .",
    "+ the basic philosophy of this paper is similar to the recent work @xcite , which introduces and analyzes in detail the gradual fo description for space - like fo situations . through the paper we are going to use the notation from ref .",
    "@xcite , recall the governing equations and the major results for comparison .",
    "we have made this paper sole and complete and widely understandable without the need to consult our previous work where the original ideas were first introduced .",
    "+ time - like discontinuities represent the overall sudden change in a finite volume where the events happen simultaneously at causally disconnected points of the hypersurface with a time - like normal vector .",
    "for example the assumption of instantaneous or isochronous fo [ i.e. , happening at a constant time in the center of mass system ] , belongs to this category .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to present an analyze a simple gradual kinetic fo process with time - like normal vectors . in the first part of this study we introduce and generalize the gradual kinetic fo treatment for a finite time - like fo layer in a fully covariant footing , while in the second part we analyze its outcome .",
    "the basis of the gradual fo method is to separate the `` full '' @xmath1 distribution function into still interacting and already frozen out parts , @xmath2 , and describe the evolution of both components in a self consistent way @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing the so - called escape rate , @xmath3 , used to drain particles , which no longer collide from the interacting component , @xmath4 , and to gradually build up the free component , @xmath5 . for the better understanding of the model we use fig .",
    "[ figure_1 t ] , and assume that the fo of particles starts from the inside boundary of the fo layer , @xmath6 ( thick line ) . within the fo layer of finite thickness , @xmath7 , the density of interacting particles decreases and disappears once we reach the outside boundary , @xmath8 ( thin line ) , of the fo layer .",
    "+ in general , the kinetic description of freeze out leads to a complex multidimensional problem . to clarify the basic properties of the fo process through a finite layer we may essentially reduce the number of variables , assuming that the dominant change in the distribution function happens in the direction of the fo normal vector , while it is negligible along the directions perpendicular to it , ( e.g. in a spherically symmetric system the change happens in radial direction , and it is negligible in the perpendicular directions )",
    "thus , the fo process can be effectively described as a one - dimensional process and the space - time domain where such a process takes place can be viewed as a fo layer , where the fo normal vector is tied to the direction of the density decrease arising from velocity divergence at a curved fo surface .",
    "+ if we have a space - like normal vector , @xmath9 , the resulting equations can be transformed into a frame where the process is stationary , while in the case of a time - like normal vector , @xmath10 , the equations can be transformed into a frame where the process is uniform and time - dependent . in this paper",
    "we only discuss fo processes inside a finite time - like layer .",
    "+ here we recall the governing equations [ i.e. , eqs .",

    "+ a qualitative expression of the escape rate for both time - like and space - like fo situations is based on the following simple assumptions .",
    "particles with higher momentum in the fo direction will freeze out first .",
    "the particles closer to the outside boundary of the fo layer have a greater chance to freeze out since the probability to find another particle to collide with is smaller as the system became sparser , ( given by the @xmath20 factor ) . in our special case",
    "the fo direction is parallel to the time - axis , thus all particles will freeze out irrespective of their momenta .",
    "however , particles emitted at later times will freeze out `` faster '' since they have less chance to collide with other particles in the diluted system .",

    "this effect has several possible explanations : products of low momentum resonance decays , the transverse expansion of the system , and possibly due to the long gradual fo with rethermalization .",

    "although the low @xmath76 enhanced non - thermal spectrum of massless pions is a necessary outcome of long gradual fo with rethermalization , for the heavy particles ( if these are in the mixture with pions ) it is almost unobservable , see ref .",
    "@xcite . + in our simplistic study we have found that fo in layer of finite thickness below @xmath60 will not show a sharp peak at low momentum in the transverse momentum spectrum . thus , naively one can conclude from a simple fit that the fo in heavy - ion collisions happens in a narrow or wide fo layer",

    "if one assumes gradual fo with non - thermal post fo spectra , then one may also fit the data but with different flow velocity and slope parameter , where the curvature of the pion spectra at low @xmath76 will be partly due to fo and partly due to the expansion of the system .",
    "we do not aim directly to apply the results presented here to experimental heavy ion collision data , instead our purpose was to study qualitatively the basic features of the freeze out process , and to demonstrate the applicability of this covariant formulation for fo in a finite layer .",
    "+ here we note that our model may be applicable in cfd calculations , where one has both time - like and space - like parts of the full fo hypersurface , thus the gradual fo calculation must be done over the full fo hypersurface , with varying flow velocities and normal vectors .",
    "the method should be applied after reaching the @xmath77 critical temperature and calculate the post fo momentum distribution function starting form the inner fo hypersurface .",
