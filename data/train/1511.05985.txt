    "massive stars began producing heavy elements near the birth of our galaxy .",
    "the records of their nucleosynthesis contributions are written into the chemical compositions of very metal - poor stars of the galactic halo .",
    "if accurate abundances can be extracted for whole element groups in these low metallicity stars , it will be possible to better understand their nucleosynthetic messages .    over the past 15 years",
    "there have been major advances in our understanding of the abundances of neutron - capture elements ( @xmath5-capture , z  @xmath6  30 ) in metal - poor stars .",
    "many of these stars have extremely detailed @xmath5-capture abundance distributions , with accurate abundances for more than 30 elements .",
    "we know that their bulk @xmath5-capture contents with respect to lighter elements vary by orders of magnitude from star to star ( , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , their nucleosynthetic origin in a given star can be attributed to rapid neutron captures ( the @xmath7-process ; @xcite and references therein ) , and/or slow neutron captures ( the @xmath8-process ; @xcite and references therein ) , and/or a variety of other processes that can contribute to the zoo of anomalous abundances observed in old halo stars ( , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a major reason for these insights has been the rapid increase in reliability of basic atomic transition data for the @xmath5-capture elements ( , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as the transition probabilities , isotopic splittings , and hyperfine structures have become more reliable , the derived @xmath5-capture abundances have also become more accurate .",
    "the same generally can not be said for lighter elements , in particular for the fe - group ( 21  @xmath9  z  @xmath9  30 ) .",
    "there have been many large - sample spectroscopic surveys of fe - group elements in halo stars beginning more than 30 years ago , with the spectroscopic quality increasing with time .",
    "the pioneering surveys of @xcite and @xcite have been followed by more detailed studies by , , those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for red giants , and that of @xcite for main - sequence stars .",
    "but the reliability of the reported abundances in any of these surveys is not assured .",
    "first , for many stars not all fe - group elements are detectable with the available spectra .",
    "second , even when elements can be detected , often only neutral - species transitions are available for analysis in typical ground - based spectra .",
    "the ionization balances of fe - group elements in metal - poor warmer dwarfs and cooler red giants usually are dominated by the ionized species ; therefore the elemental abundances are mostly based on results from the minority species .",
    "third , in many instances only a handful of lines are employed to form individual elemental abundances .",
    "finally , significant questions have been raised about whether local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) can adequately describe the ionization equilibrium , and large upward corrections have been proposed to lte - based abundances from neutral species .",
    "our group has been concentrating on improving the laboratory data for fe - group neutral and singly - ionized transitions that are of interest to cool - star stellar spectroscopy .",

    "a list of past analyses can be found in the saga database @xcite ; all of these studies derive similar atmospheric parameters .",
    "third , the relatively high temperature and gravity of  combine to produce large densities that favor lte approximations for atomic level populations and planck source functions ; such simplifications are much more problematic for cool metal - poor red giants .",
    "finally , the same atmospheric conditions lead to continuum opacities that are dominated by h@xmath28 at most wavelengths ; continuum scattering is unimportant even in the @xmath29 spectral region .",
    "abundances were derived following the methods of our previous papers .",
    "we computed synthetic spectra in small spectral intervals surrounding all photospheric transitions with the current version of the lte line analysis code moog @xcite .",
    "atomic and molecular line lists for the syntheses were based on the transitions compiled in the @xcite database .",
    "these lists were updated with : _ ( a ) _ new fe - group transition probabilities and isotopic / hyperfine substructures presented in this series of papers ; _",
    "( b ) _ similar data from our earlier publications on @xmath5-capture elements ( @xcite and references therein ) ; and _ ( c ) _ recent molecular laboratory data on c@xmath30 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ch @xcite , cn ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and mgh ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the computed solar spectra were smoothed with gaussians to account for instrument profile and solar macroturbulence , and then compared to the center - of - disk solar spectrum of @xcite to estimate the line - by - line abundances .",
    "this procedure was also followed for , except that here we used the version of moog that has scattering included in the continuum source function @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in earlier papers , for this and other main - sequence turnoff stars the scattering contributions are not important .",
    "h@xmath28 dominates the continuum opacity , followed by h i in the balmer continuum region ( 3100@xmath03650   ) .",
    "therefore we would have obtained essentially the same  abundances with the standard moog version .",
    "in this section we discuss our analyses of the solar photosphere and .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] contains the abundances , standard deviations , and numbers of transitions for neutral and singly - ionized ( hereafter , `` ionized '' ) species of these elements .    in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we compare our `` new '' solar abundances to the recent detailed analyses of @xcite for sc@xmath0ni , and of @xcite for cu and zn .",
    "also tabulated are solar photospheric abundances recommended in the review by @xcite , and the meteoritic abundances recommended by @xcite .",
    "we quote four values for each species from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "three of these abundances come from their papers , and the values that they obtained from their lte analyses with the @xcite model solar photosphere are from p. scott ( 2015 , private communication ) . our abundances are essentially identical to their lte values ; differences in detail can be attributed to line choices , transition probability assumptions , etc . @xcite and @xcite consider in detail the various issues involved in photospheric abundance determinations , including choice of model atmosphere grid , 1d versus 3d atmospheric structure , and local versus non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte versus nlte ) in atomic level populations and line source functions .",
    "the reader is urged to consult those papers for additional information on solar abundance calculations and their uncertainties .",
    "our fe - group abundances of  have been determined from a total of 1162 spectral features ( 551 lines of neutral and ionized fe , and 611 of other elements ) .",
    "the number of lines used for each species is depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] . only cu and zn abundances have been determined from a single species with less than five lines each . for sc",
    "only the ionized lines are detectable , but 25 of these form the elemental mean abundance .",
    "eight elements in this study have abundances determined from ionized transitions , with no fewer than eight lines forming the means of each species abundance .",
    "this is important because ions comprise the vast majority of the total numbers for all fe - group elements except zn .",
    "we illustrate this point in figure  [ fig2 ] with number density ratios log(n@xmath31/n@xmath32 ) plotted as functions of optical depth , from straightforward saha equation calculations .",

    "@xmath33  2 , throughout the  atmosphere , four other elements have log(n@xmath31/n@xmath32 )  @xmath33  1.3 , meaning that the ionized species is at least 20 times more abundant than the neutral species at all atmospheric levels .",
    "the sole exception is zn , whose ionization potential of 9.39  ev is high enough to keep a substantial fraction in its neutral species .",
    "our analyses of ti , v , co , and ni have been discussed in detail in previous papers of this series , and those results will be summarized together in ",
    "[ abtivconi ] .",
    "we have comparatively little information on cu and zn , and none of their laboratory data have been generated in this series of papers ; thus we will deal briefly with them together in  [ abcuzn ] .",
    "the remaining elements sc , cr , mn , and fe have transition data published by the university of wisconsin laboratory group and collaborators , but we have not applied these lab results previously to . each of the elements will be described in subsections below , beginning with the fundamental metallicity indicator fe .",
    "neutral and ionized fe lines are ubiquitous in the spectra of cool stars , and this element is almost always used as a surrogate for overall metallicity .",
    "it is unfortunate that fe i and fe ii have not enjoyed comprehensive laboratory transition data studies in recent years .",
    "however , new accurate @xmath34-values for fe i lines arising from excited states ( @xmath35  =  2.4@xmath05.1  ev ) have been published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if we combine these transition probabilities and those for lines with @xmath35  @xmath4  2.4  ev from the earlier study by @xcite , a total of nearly 1100 fe i lines from one collaborative laboratory research group can be applied to stellar spectra .",
    "this combined fe i list should be on an internally consistent @xmath34 scale , and it has been adopted here .",
    "we first applied the fe i line list to the solar spectrum , but restricted the wavelength range to 4500    @xmath4  @xmath19  @xmath4 6450   .",
    "the blue limit was set by the steady increases in average fe i line strengths and spectroscopic complexity due to other atomic and molecular species .",
    "the number of usable solar features drops precipitously below 4500   .",
    "the red limit was set by the long wavelength end of our fe ii line list ( to be discussed below ) ; thus the solar fe abundance derived here depends on neutral and ionized lines arising in similar spectral regions . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we list wavelengths , excitation energies , log  @xmath34 values and their sources , and derived abundances for the fe i lines used in the solar analysis , and in the upper panel of figure  [ fig3 ] we display the photospheric line abundances as a function of wavelength . the scatter ( @xmath36  =  0.057 ) is small and probably is limited by the solar analysis uncertainties . the mean abundance , log  @xmath37  =  7.523 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) , agrees with the sc015 value derived with the hm model and is similar to other solar values ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "there are no recent single - source lab transition studies of fe ii . here",
    "we chose to use the @xmath34-values from the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) atomic spectra database , which are based on a `` critical compilation '' @xcite of previously published values .",
    "since our transition probabilities are taken directly from the nist website , we cite that source for the fe ii lines in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the original @xmath34 data are from ( mostly experimental ) papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which are cited for each line by nist .",
    "the number of available fe ii lines for a solar abundance analysis is not large , and in the end just 16 were used .",
    "we attempted to analyze only two fe ii lines with wavelengths below 4500   , deeming others to be too strong / weak / blended to yield reliable abundances .",
    "however , the mean abundance derived from fe ii lines is in agreement with the fe i value . recognizing the lack of comprehensive lab studies of fe ii , @xcite combined some laboratory @xmath34 values with ones derived from a reverse solar analysis .",
    "however , the lower wavelength limit of their study was 4087   .",
    "since our goal is to use as many lines as possible down to 2300    in the  spectrum , we have not considered their data further here .    for  we used the complete fe i list and found 446 useful lines over the wavelength range 2300    @xmath18  @xmath19  @xmath18 9000   .",
    "these line abundances are given in table  [ tab3 ] and plotted as a function of wavelength in the lower panel of figure  [ fig3 ] .",

    "the fe i lines both blueward and redward of this region yield consistent abundances .",
    "we also derived fe abundances for the fe i lines using the transition probabilities from the oxford ( @xcite and references therein ) and hannover ( @xcite , @xcite ) laboratory groups . for 61 lines in common with the oxford group , , @xmath38 = @xmath00.02 with @xmath36 = 0.09 . with these transition probabilities ,",

    "we also note the large scatter in abundance values for these stars at lower metallicities . superimposed on these data",
    "are several gce model curves .",
    "these include @xcite and the new model with the jet effects , indicated by the dashed line in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "it is seen in the figure that including additional physics effects has led to increasing agreement between theory and observations .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] gives an overview of the evolution of all fe - peak elements in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the large filled circles are the mean abundances of  from table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "the black dots represent observational data before 2014 ( @xcite ) and the cyan plus signs are from @xcite .",
    "elements sc , ti , v , and cr have some abundance information from both neutral and ionized species in various literature sources . in figure  [ fig12 ] we have chosen to plot only abundances derived from sc ii , ti i , v i , and cr ii . for ti , v , cr , ni , cu , and zn there is excellent accord between the survey results of @xcite and those of the other included literature studies , but systematic offsets of @xmath100.2@xmath00.3  dex are apparent for sc , mn and co. the reasons for these shifts deserve systematic investigation in future studies .",
    "the difference in the adopted imfs is negligible , and the 2006 ( red short - dashed lines ) and 2011 ( green solid lines ) models give almost the same trends at [ fe / h ] @xmath83 .",
    "the small difference at [ fe / h ] @xmath84 between the 2006 and 2011 models is caused by the small difference in the delay - time distributions of sne ia .",
    "the blue dashed lines of figure  [ fig12 ] include the effects of jet - like explosions of hypernovae , and one sees that these models are much closer to the observational data especially for sc , ti , v , and perhaps zn .",
    "in addition , the @xmath85-process also enhances sc , v , and ti isotopes @xmath41ti in the yields calculated in @xcite .",
    "we note that currently the new gce model illustrated in figure  [ fig11 ] and figure  [ fig12 ] underproduces the observed sc , v , and ti abundance ratios in  and in the bulk of stars .",
    "nevertheless , the interplay between the multidimensional effects and additional neutrino effects ( e.g. , the @xmath85-processes ) , may increase the predicted production of sc , ti , and v abundances making them closer to those that are observed .",
    "detailed explorations of models and abundances for all fe - group elements are beyond the scope of this paper , but a few other comments here are appropriate .",
    "cr abundances are consistent with all these models , which has been shown in the comparison with the cr ii observations in @xcite .",
    "[ mn / fe ] seems @xmath86 dex lower in the models than in the observations at [ fe / h ] @xmath83 , which can easily solved with varying @xmath78 .",
    "both in the observations and gce models , the [ mn / fe ] ratio shows an increasing trend from [ fe / h ]  @xmath87 to @xmath88 because mn is produced more by sne ia than by core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this mn increase can not be reproduced with other sn ia models such as double degenerate systems or double detonations @xcite .",
    "ni / fe ] seems @xmath89 dex lower in the models than in the observations at [ fe / h ] @xmath83 , which may be difficult to solve because ni and zn have an opposite response to @xmath78 .",
    "ni is overproduced by sne ia in the short - dashed and solid lines at [ fe / h ]  @xmath33  @xmath76 . as noted in @xcite , with delayed detonations ,",
    "this ni overproduction problem can be eased , which is included in the 2015 model ( long - dashed lines ) . at [ fe / h ] @xmath18 -2.5 ,",
    "the observed [ co / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios show a rising trend at lower metallicities .",
    "the observed cu abundances are roughly consistent with the models .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , higher explosion energies lead to higher values of [ ( co , zn)/fe ] , so that an even higher hypernovae fraction may be required at low metallicities .",
    "we have conducted an extensive fe - group elemental abundance analysis in the metal - poor main - sequence turnoff star , involving nearly 1200 lines of 17 species .",
    "derived abundances of neutrals and ions are the same within mutual uncertainties for all seven fe - group elements with two species available for study .",
    "this strongly suggests that standard saha ionization balance holds for , and that the observed abundance ratios among fe - group elements can be treated as true measures of prior nucleosynthesis events .",
    "the @xmath100.3  dex overabundances of sc , ti and v relative to fe in  are of greatest nucleosynthetic interest .",
    "an examination of the abundances of sc , ti and v suggest a correlation of their abundance enrichments in the early galaxy .",
    "this may be due to a common nucleosynthesis origin for ti and v in the ccsn ejecta , while the production of sc is more complex . a more detailed analysis to clearly identify what",
    "components are dominating the production of sc is needed .",
    "gce models can not yet reproduce all of the observed abundance trends as a function of [ fe / h ] for these iron - peak elements , particularly at low metallicities .",
    "we explore the impact of new stellar models , and we discuss how observations can be used to constrain theoretical models of ccsne and hypernovae . for",
    "we have derived [ ( sc , ti , v / fe ) ]  @xmath44  @xmath10.3 , well above the observed uncertainties of @xmath180.1 dex from the species @xmath36 values . in the future , additional precise abundance determinations in metal - poor halo stars , taking advantage of new atomic laboratory data for the fe - peak elements , should be undertaken .",
    "they suggest that with the additional inclusion of physics effects , the observational and theoretical agreement will improve .",
