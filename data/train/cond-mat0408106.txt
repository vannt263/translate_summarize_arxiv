    "the problem of the so - called `` coffee - drop deposit '' has recently aroused great interest .",
    "the residue left when coffee dries on the countertop is usually darkest and hence most concentrated along the perimeter of the stain .",
    "ring - like stains , with the solute segregated to the edge of a drying drop , are not particular to coffee .",
    "mineral rings left on washed glassware , banded deposits of salt on the sidewalk during winter , and enhanced edges in water color paintings are all examples of the variety of physical systems displaying similar behavior and understood by coffee - drop deposit terminology .    understanding the process of drying of such solutions is important for many scientific and industrial applications , where ability to control the distribution of the solute during drying process is at stake .",
    "for instance , in the paint industry , the pigment should be evenly dispersed after drying , and the segregation effects are highly undesirable .",
    "also , in the protein crystallography , attempts are made to assemble the two - dimensional crystals by using evaporation driven convection  @xcite , and hence solute concentration gradients should be avoided . on the other hand , in the production of nanowires  @xcite or in surface",
    "patterning  @xcite perimeter - concentrated deposits may be of advantage .",
    "recent important applications of this phenomenon related to dna stretching in a flow have emerged as well  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a high - throughput automatic dna mapping was suggested  @xcite , where fluid flow induced by evaporation is used for both stretching dna molecules and depositing them onto a substrate .",
    "droplet drying is also important in the attempts to create arrays of dna spots for gene expression analysis .",
    "ring - like deposit patterns have been studied experimentally by a number of groups .",
    "difficulties of obtaining a uniform deposit  @xcite , deformation of sessile drops due to a sol - gel transition of the solute at the contact line  @xcite , stick - slip motion of the contact line of colloidal liquids  @xcite , multiple ring formation  @xcite , and the effect of ring formation on the evaporation of the sessile drops  @xcite were all reported .",
    "the evaporation of the sessile drops ( regardless of the solute presence ) has also been investigated extensively .",
    "constancy of the evaporation flux was demonstrated  @xcite , and the change of the geometrical characteristics ( contact angle , drop height , contact - line radius ) during drying was measured in detail  @xcite .",
    "the most recent and complete experimental effort to date on coffee - drop deposits was conducted by robert deegan _",
    "et al . _",
    "most experimental data referred to in this work originate from observations and measurements of this group .",
    "they reported extensive results on ring formation and demonstrated that these could be quantitatively accounted for .",
    "the main ideas of the theory of solute transfer in such physical systems have also been developed in their work  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the contact line of a drop of liquid remains pinned during most of the drying process .",
    "while the highest evaporation occurs at the edges , the bulk of the solvent is concentrated closer to the center of the drop . in order to replenish the liquid removed by evaporation at the edge , a flow from the inner to the outer regions must exist inside the drop . this flow is capable of transferring all of the solute to the contact line and thus accounts for the strong contact - line concentration of the residue left after complete drying .",
    "this theory is very robust since it is independent of the nature of the solute and only requires pinning of the edge during drying ( which can occur in a number of possible ways : surface roughness , chemical heterogeneities _ etc _ ) . among other things ,",
    "we will reproduce some of its results in this work .",
    "mathematically , the most complicated task is related to determining the evaporation rate from the surface of the drop .",
    "an analogy between the diffusive concentration fields and the electrostatic potential fields was suggested  @xcite , so that an equivalent electrostatic problem can be solved instead of the evaporation problem .",
    "important analytical solutions to this equivalent problem in various geometries were first derived by lebedev  @xcite , and a few useful consequences from these analytical results were later reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we continue development of the theory of solute transfer and deposit growth .",
    "most previous works address the issue of the deposit mass accumulation at the drop boundary , however , they treat the solute particles as if they do not occupy any volume , and hence all the solute can be accommodated at the one - dimensional singularity of the contact line . in reality , the solute deposit accumulated at the perimeter has some thickness , and the shape of the residue in a round drop resembles a ring rather than an infinitely thin circumference of the circle .",
    "the earlier efforts were aimed at describing how the _ mass _ of the contact - line deposit grows with time and how it depends on such geometrical characteristics of the drop as its radius ( for circular drops",
    "@xcite ) or its opening angle and the distance from the vertex ( for pointed drops  @xcite ) .",
    "little attempt has been made to describe the geometrical characteristics of the contact - line deposit itself , for instance , the width and the height of the deposit ring . at the same time , there is solid experimental data  @xcite on various geometrical characteristics of the ring and their dependence on time , the initial solute concentration , and the drop geometry .",
    "here we develop a simple model that addresses this lack of understanding of the geometrical properties of the contact - line deposit and accounts for the finite size of the deposit ring .",
    "we attribute the finite volume of the deposit simply to the finite size of the solute particles , _ i.e. _  we assume the particles do occupy some volume and hence can not be packed denser than certain concentration .",
    "the model is solved in the simplest case of the circular geometry both analytically and numerically , and the results of the two methods are compared with the experimental data of refs .",
    "@xcite ( and with each other ) .",
    "it turns out that this model is sufficient to explain most of the collected data .",
    "it should be noted that the model is as universal and robust ( in its range of validity ) as the zero - volume theory of deegan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite since it is based on essentially the same physical principles .",
    "the notion that the profile of the deposit could be found by the simple assumption that the solute becomes immobilized when the volume fraction reaches a threshold was originally suggested by todd dupont  @xcite .",
    "first efforts to create a model were conducted by robert deegan  @xcite who formulated some physical assumptions , wrote them down mathematically , and obtained some early - time exponents . here",
    "we present the entire problem , including its full formulation and its analytical and numerical solutions ( not reported previously ) . in the next section ,",
    "we formulate the model , describe the system , and address some issues of the geometry and the evaporation rate .",
    "then , we derive the governing equations from the conservation of mass and later solve them analytically for small initial concentrations of the solute and numerically for arbitrary initial concentrations of the solute .",
    "a discussion section concludes this work .",
    "[ [ system . ] ] system .",
    "we consider a sessile droplet of solution on a horizontal surface ( substrate ) .",
    "the nature of the solute is not essential for the mechanism .",
    "the typical diameter of the solute particles in deegan s experiments  @xcite was of the order of 0.11  @xmath0 m ; we will assume a similar order of magnitude throughout this work",
    ". for smaller particles diffusion becomes important ; for larger particles sedimentation may play an important role .",
    "the droplet is bounded by the contact line in the plane of the substrate .",
    "this ( macroscopic ) contact line is defined as the common one - dimensional boundary of all three phases ( liquid , air and solid substrate ) .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the case of the round drops , which is both of most practical importance and the easiest to treat mathematically .",
    "we assume that the droplet is sufficiently small so that the surface tension is dominant , and the gravitational effects can be neglected .",
    "mathematically , the balance of the gravitational force and the surface tension is controlled by the ratio of the ( maximal ) hydrostatic pressure @xmath1 to the laplace pressure @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fluid density , @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the surface tension at the liquid - air interface , @xmath6 is the drop radius in the plane of the substrate , and @xmath7 is the maximal height of the drop . for the typical experimental conditions this ratio @xmath8 is quite small ( about 0.25 ) , and thus gravity is indeed unimportant and the surface shape is governed mostly by the surface tension .",
    "our treatment will produce the main - order term in the expansion in this parameter , and since the parameter value is not an order of magnitude smaller than one , it may be necessary to construct the correctional terms for better quantitative agreement . for the present purposes , even the main term turns out to be sufficient to obtain the agreement with the experimental results .",
    "experimentally , the contact line remains _ pinned _ during most of the drying process .",
    "therefore , we do _ not _ assume that the contact angle @xmath9 between the liquid - air interface and the plane of the substrate is constant in time .",
    "a strongly pinned contact line can sustain a wide range of ( macroscopic ) contact angles .",
    "the pinning mechanism can be described as self - pinning , _",
    "i.e. _  pinning by the deposit brought to the contact line by the hydrodynamic flows caused by evaporation .",
    "a pinned contact line entails fluid flow toward that contact line .",
    "the `` elasticity '' of the liquid - air interface fixed at the contact line provides the force driving this flow .",
    "we will deal with small contact angles ( @xmath10 ) as it is almost always the case in the experimental realizations , including the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite ( typically , @xmath110.3 ) .",
    "it will also be seen necessary to assume that the contact angle is small in order to obtain any analytical results in a closed form .",
    "a drop with a small contact angle is necessarily _ thin _ , _",
    "i.e. _  its maximal height is much smaller than its radius and the slope of the free surface is small ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus , we consider small contact angles , or , equivalently , thin drops .",
    "we also consider _ slow _ flows , _ i.e. _  flows with low reynolds numbers , which amounts to the neglect of the inertial terms in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the free surface is described by the local mean curvature that is spatially uniform at any given moment of time , but changes with time as the droplet dries .",
    "ideally , the surface shape should be considered dynamically together with the flow field inside the drop . however , as was shown earlier  @xcite , for flow velocities much lower than the characteristic velocity @xmath13 ( where @xmath5 is the surface tension and @xmath14 is the dynamic viscosity ) , which is about 24  m / s for water under normal conditions , one can consider the surface shape _ independently _ of the flow and use the equilibrium result at any given moment of time for finding the flow at that time .",
    "equivalently , the ratio of the viscous forces to the capillary forces is the capillary number @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is some characteristic value of the flow velocity , which is of the order of 110  @xmath0 m/s ) , and this number is of the order of @xmath17@xmath18 under typical experimental conditions .",
    "thus , the capillary forces are by far the dominant ones .",
    "[ [ geometry - and - surface - shape . ] ] geometry and surface shape .",
    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath19 will be used throughout this work , as they are most natural for the geometry of interest .",
    "the origin is chosen in the center of the circular footprint of the drop on the substrate .",
    "coordinate @xmath20 is always normal to the substrate , and the substrate is described by @xmath21 , with @xmath20 being positive on the droplet side of the space .",
    "coordinates @xmath22 are the polar radius and the azimuthal angle , respectively , so that the contact line is described by @xmath23 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the drop footprint . due to the axial symmetry of the problem and our choice of the coordinates , no quantity depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath24 .",
    "our model pictures the drop as a two - component system ( the components being `` the fluid '' and `` the solute '' ) , which has two `` phases '' : `` the liquid phase '' in the middle of the drop and `` the deposit phase '' near the contact line .",
    "both components are present in both phases , and the difference between the phases lies only in the concentration of the solute in each phase . in the deposit phase ,",
    "the volume fraction of the solute @xmath25 is high and _ fixed _ in both space and time .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is just a constant number , one can think of it as comparable to the close - packing fraction or unity .",
    "( the case of @xmath26 may seem to be special as there is no fluid in the deposit phase ; however , for small initial concentrations of the solute this case will be seen to lead to exactly the same main order results . ) in the liquid phase , the volume fraction of the solute @xmath27 varies in space and changes with time , and it is relatively small compared to @xmath25 .",
    "the initial volume fraction @xmath28 is constant throughout the drop ; at later moments the solute gets redistributed due to the flows , and the concentration becomes different in different parts of the liquid phase .",
    "the volume fraction of the fluid is then @xmath29 in the deposit phase and @xmath30 in the liquid phase .",
    "note that we do not require @xmath31 so far , although we do assume @xmath32 .",
    "it should also be emphasized that we do not presume there is any real `` phase difference '' between the so - called phases : one phase is just defined as having the maximal reachable solute fraction @xmath25 ( the solute can not move in this phase ) while the other phase is characterized by lower solute fraction @xmath27 ( in this phase the solute can move and hence its concentration can change in time and space ) . besides this difference , the phases are essentially identical .",
    "the idea that the solute loses its mobility when its concentration exceeds some threshold was suggested by todd dupont  @xcite .",
    "since the drop is thin , we employ the vertically averaged flow velocity @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the in - plane component of the local three - dimensional velocity @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the thickness of the drop at distance @xmath37 from the center . by making this approximation",
    ", we implicitly assume that there is no vertical segregation of the solute , and thus we turn our model into effectively two - dimensional .",
    "this is done mostly for simplicity and is not expected to affect our main conclusions ( see discussion ) . within this model ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the boundary between the phases is vertical .",
    "thus , the particles get stacked uniformly at all heights when being brought to the phase boundary by the hydrodynamic flow @xmath38 .",
    "this boundary can be pictured as a vertical wall at some radius @xmath39 from the center of the drop , and this wall propagates from the contact line [ located at @xmath40 towards the center of the drop .",
    "[ phaseseps ] illustrates the mutual location of the two phases , and fig .",
    "[ evolutioneps ] schematically shows the time evolution of the drying process and growth of the deposit phase .",
    "the geometrical parameters of the model are shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry - ring ] .",
    "the radius of the drop is @xmath6 , the radius of the phase boundary is @xmath39 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the height of the phase boundary is @xmath42 , and the initial condition is @xmath43 . in the liquid phase ,",
    "we conveniently split the total height of the free surface @xmath44 into the sum of @xmath42 and @xmath45 .     and @xmath46 .",
    "]    since @xmath47 is independent of @xmath37 , function @xmath48 satisfies the young - laplace equation ( the statement of the mechanical equilibrium of the liquid - air interface ) @xmath49 where @xmath5 is the surface tension , @xmath50 is the pressure difference across the liquid - air interface , and @xmath51 is the mean curvature of the surface , uniquely related to the surface shape @xmath52 by differential geometry . for typical drying conditions , @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath52 vary with time slowly .",
    "as was shown earlier  @xcite , it is sufficient to find the equilibrium surface shape first , and then determine the velocity field for this fixed functional form of @xmath52 with time being just an adiabatic parameter , instead of solving for all the dynamical quantities simultaneously .",
    "thus , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) does _ not _ depend on the local coordinates of a point within the drop ( although it does depend on time ) , and the equation itself expresses the global condition of spatial constancy of the mean curvature throughout the drop .",

    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) with boundary condition @xmath53 is just a spherical cap , and hence the shape of the upper part of the drop ( above the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ geometry - ring ] ) is just a spherical cap : @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the angle between the liquid - air interface and the substrate at phase boundary , and functions @xmath39 and @xmath55 are related via the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) : @xmath56 in the limit of small contact angles , @xmath10 , the preceding expression adopts even simpler form : @xmath57 note that we do not assume that @xmath55 and @xmath45 are necessarily positive at all times : both can be negative at later drying stages , and the shape of the liquid - air interface may be concave",
    ". both convex and concave solutions for @xmath45 are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) ; the right - hand side of this equation can have either sign . by definition ,",
    "both @xmath55 and @xmath45 are positive when the surface is convex ( and hence they are positive at the beginning of the drying process ) and negative when the surface is concave .",
    "the initial value of @xmath55 coincides with the initial contact angle @xmath58",
    ".    clearly , there are three unknown functions of time in this geometry : @xmath55 , @xmath39 and @xmath42",
    ". however , these quantities are not independent of each other .",
    "since we assume that the solute particles fill up the entire space between the substrate and the liquid - air interface when being brought to the phase boundary , the three geometrical functions are related by the constraint @xmath59 physically , the angles between the liquid - air interface and the substrate are identical on both sides of the phase boundary ( @xmath60 ) , and hence @xmath48 and its first derivative are continuous past this boundary .",
    "thus , there are actually only two _ independent _ functions of time , @xmath55 and @xmath39",
    ". condition  ( [ constraint ] ) was first introduced by robert deegan  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical definitions above allow one to determine the volume of each of the two phases .",
    "volume of the liquid phase is simply @xmath61 taking into account relation  ( [ constraint ] ) , an infinitesimal variation of this volume can be expressed via the infinitesimal variations of @xmath9 and @xmath62 : @xmath63 the first term is responsible for the motion of the liquid - air interface , and the second term corresponds to the inward shift of the phase boundary .",
    "it is also straightforward to obtain an expression for the differential of the volume of the deposit phase , which has only the term related to the inward shift of the phase boundary : @xmath64 we will use the last two expressions in the following section .",
    "we will also adopt the notation that subscripts l and d refer to the liquid and deposit phases , respectively .    before proceeding to the main section",
    ", we will make a note on the evaporation rate .",
    "[ [ evaporation - rate . ] ] evaporation rate .    in order to determine the flow caused by evaporation",
    ", one needs to know the flux profile of liquid leaving each point of the surface .",
    "this quantity is independent of the processes going on inside the drop and must be determined prior to considering any such processes .",
    "the functional form of the evaporation rate @xmath65 ( defined as the evaporative mass loss per unit surface area per unit time ) depends on the rate - limiting step , which can , in principle , be either the transfer rate across the liquid - vapor interface or the diffusive relaxation of the saturated vapor layer immediately above the drop .",
    "we assume that the rate - limiting step is the diffusion of the saturated vapor .",
    "indeed , the transfer rate across the liquid - vapor interface is characterized by the time scale of the order of @xmath66  s , while the diffusion process has characteristic times of the order of @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 is the diffusion constant for vapor in air and @xmath6 is a characteristic size of the drop ) , which is of the order of seconds for water drops under typical drying conditions .",
    "the diffusion - limited evaporation rapidly attains a steady state .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the time required for the vapor - phase water concentration to adjust to the changes in the droplet shape ( @xmath69 ) to the droplet evaporation time @xmath70 is of the order of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the density of the saturated vapor just above the liquid - air interface , @xmath73 is the ambient vapor density , and @xmath3 is the fluid density  @xcite , _ i.e. _  the vapor concentration adjusts rapidly compared to the evaporation time .",
    "as the rate - limiting process is the diffusion , vapor density @xmath74 above the liquid - vapor interface obeys the diffusion equation . since the process is quasi - steady , this diffusion equation reduces to the laplace equation",
    "@xmath75 this equation is to be solved together with the following boundary conditions : ( a ) along the surface of the drop the air is saturated with vapor and hence @xmath74 at the interface is the constant density of the saturated vapor @xmath72 , ( b ) far away from the drop the density approaches the constant ambient vapor density @xmath73 , and ( c ) the vapor can not penetrate the substrate and hence @xmath76 at the substrate outside of the drop . having found the vapor density , one can obtain the evaporation rate @xmath77 , where @xmath68 is the diffusion constant .",
    "this boundary problem is mathematically equivalent to that of a charged conductor of the same geometry at constant potential if we identify @xmath74 with the electrostatic potential and @xmath78 with the electric field .",
    "moreover , since there is no component of @xmath78 normal to the substrate , we can further simplify the boundary problem by considering a conductor of the shape of our drop plus its reflection in the plane of the substrate in the full space instead of viewing only the semi - infinite space bounded by the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ evaprateeps ] ) .",
    "this reduces the number of boundary conditions to only two : ( a ) @xmath79 on the surface of the conductor , and ( b ) @xmath80 at infinity .",
    "the shape of the conductor ( the drop and its reflection in the substrate ) is now symmetric with respect to the plane of the substrate and resembles a symmetrical double - convex lens comprised of two spherical caps .",
    "this equivalent electrostatic problem of finding the electric field around the conductor at constant potential in the infinite space is much simpler than the original problem in the semi - infinite space .",
    "the reflection technique for finding the evaporation field on the basis of the analogy between the diffusion and the electrostatics was originally used by deegan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .        even in the circular geometry",
    "the equivalent problem is still quite complicated despite the visible simplicity .",
    "we consider an object whose symmetry does not match the symmetry of any simple orthogonal coordinate system of the three - dimensional space . in order to solve the laplace equation ,",
    "one is forced to introduce a special coordinate system ( the so - called toroidal coordinates ) with heavy use of the special functions . the full solution to this problem",
    "is provided in the appendix .",
    "the evaporation rate depends only on the overall shape of the drop , and evaporation occurs in the same fashion from both phases .",
    "we assume that the evaporation is not influenced by any motion of the solute inside the drop , and the necessary amount of fluid can always be supplied to the regions of the highest evaporation near the contact line .",
    "physically , high evaporation near the edge is what brings the solute to the contact line , and we assume that presence of the deposit does not obstruct the motion of the fluid ( fig .",
    "[ suckseps ] ) .",
    "since the drop is thin and the contact angle is small , we will use expression @xmath81 for the evaporation rate ( derived in the appendix for no - solute drops in the limit @xmath10 ) , which has the one - over - the - square - root divergence near the contact line intuitively expected from the electrostatics .",
    "the real situation may be different from the assumed above when @xmath25 is large or comparable to 1 , and the edge of the area where the evaporation occurs may be located near the boundary of the phases instead of the contact line .",
    "however , for small initial concentrations of the solute , the main order result will be insensitive to the exact location of the singularity of the evaporation rate : whether it is located at the contact line or near the boundary of the phases .",
    "we will further comment on this case of the `` dry deposit '' when we obtain the full system of equations .",
    "[ [ global - conservation - of - fluid . ] ] global conservation of fluid .    the essence of the entire theory can best be summarized in one sentence : `` it is all about the conservation of mass .

    "we start from the global conservation of fluid in the drop .",
    "since the amount of solute within the drop does not change during the drying process , the change of the entire drop volume is equal to the change of the amount of fluid .",
    "this fluid gets evaporated from the surface , and the total change of the fluid volume equals to the amount evaporated from the surface : @xmath82 by convention , superscripts f and s refer to the fluid and the solute components , respectively ( while subscripts l and d continue to denote phases ) .",

    "the answer lies in the fact that the width measured in the experiments  @xcite is not the full width of the ring at the end of the drying process , but rather the width of the ring at _ depinning_. depinning is a process of the detachment of the liquid phase from the deposit ring ( fig .",

    "indeed , the volume of the deposit ring is roughly proportional to the product of the height and the width . on the other hand ,",
    "the height is of the same order of magnitude as the width since the ratio of the two is of the order of @xmath124 ( which is a constant ) .",

    "the availability of the exact analytical solution demonstrated that the theoretical scaling of the deposit width at depinning with solute concentration indeed agrees with both measured values of the exponents .",
    "the earlier estimate of refs .",
    "@xcite based solely on the early - time exponent had an overlap with only one of the concentration exponents .",
    "our numerical results also quantify the range of solute concentrations where the predicted square - root dependence of the width holds true .",
    "in general , robert deegan s results were not sufficient to obtain the proper scaling of the width with time anywhere beyond the very early drying stages ; the results of this work provide that time scaling at _ all _ drying stages .",
    "all the presented results suggest that the deposit ring profile and its growth can be fully accounted for on the basis of the finite volume of the solute particles only and that the governing functional dependences are _ universal . _",
    "one may notice that the curves in fig .",
    "[ profileeps ] end at some positive ( non - zero ) height .",
    "this indicates the solute is exhausted before the profile curves have a chance to return to the substrate , and the final shape of the deposit ring must have a vertical wall at its inner side .",
    "we believe this is an artifact of our model , which is inherently two - dimensional when flows inside the drop are concerned .",
    "thus , the vertical distribution of the solute was assumed homogeneous ( the phase boundary is vertical and the particles get stacked uniformly at all heights ) , and we used the depth - averaged velocity  ( [ defv ] ) throughout this work .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that vertical mixing is complete .",
    "this assumption is quite important , and the results are expected to get modified if the true three - dimensional velocity profile is used instead of the depth - averaged velocity .",
    "we expect that if a three - dimensional model were built and the dependence on @xmath20 were taken into account for all the quantities then the discontinuous wall of the phase boundary would get smoothened and the height would continuously return to zero .",
    "a question remains whether such a model would be solvable analytically .",
    "our model relies on the assumption that solute mobility is different in the so - called liquid and deposit phases .",
    "in essence , we assume that the mobility is 0 in the deposit phase and 1 in the liquid phase .",
    "this assumption , while artificial in its nature , seems relatively reasonable when applied to this system .",
    "indeed , in the physical situations near the close packing , the loss of mobility typically occurs over a quite narrow range of the concentration values , and hence our assumption should work satisfactorily when the difference between @xmath108 and @xmath25 is in the orders of magnitude .",
    "the higher the initial concentration is and the closer the two values are , the worse this assumption holds true and the more artificial the difference between the two phases is .",
    "thus , the validity of any model based on this separation of the mobility scales decreases for higher initial concentrations of the solute .",
    "the model assumes that the free - surface slope between the liquid and the deposit phases is continuous .",
    "in fact , assumption  ( [ constraint ] ) expressing this continuity is one of the four basic equations of this work .",
    "this assumption seems quite natural as well .",
    "indeed , if the liquid is present on both sides of the phase boundary , the change in the slope of its free surface would cost extra energy from the extra curvature at the phase boundary , since the liquid - air interface possesses effective elasticity .",
    "presence of this extra energy ( or the extra pressure ) at the location of the phase boundary is not justified by any physical reasons as all the processes are slow and the surface is in equilibrium . in equilibrium ,",
    "the surface shape must have constant curvature past the phase boundary since the entire separation into the two phases is quite artificial as discussed above .",
    "presence of the particles below the liquid - air interface does not influence the surface tension , and thus the liquid surface ( and its slope ) should be continuous at the phase boundary . if the density of the particles matches the density of the liquid ( which was the case in the experiments ) , nothing prevents the particles from filling up the entire space between the substrate and the liquid - air interface , thus providing the growth of the upper edge of the deposit phase _ along _ the liquid - air interface .",
    "this is particularly true for the thin drops discussed here , where vertical mixing is intensive , where the free surface is nearly horizontal , and where the problem is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "however , the equality of the slopes on both sides of the phase boundary does _ not _ seem inevitable , and one may think of the situations when it does get violated .",
    "one example might be the late drying times , when the deposit growth is very fast [ fig .  [ resultseps](b ) ] and hence the deposition may occur in some non - regular manner inconsistent with this slow - process description .",
    "other examples may be related to gravity ( slightly unequal densities of the particles and the fluid ) or convection .",
    "this assumption can possibly be checked experimentally , and if condition  ( [ constraint ] ) is found violated , an equivalent constraint dependent on the details of the deposit - growth mechanism must be constructed in place of eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "another inherent assumption of our model is related to the evaporation rate @xmath65 .",
    "presence of the solute inside the drop was assumed not to affect the evaporation from its surface .",
    "this is generally true when the evaporation is not too fast and the deposit phase is not too thick and not too concentrated .",
    "when these conditions are not obeyed , presence of a thick or concentrated layer of the solute on the way of the liquid moving from the phase boundary to the contact line may create a strong viscous force .",
    "this viscous force would prevent the necessary amount of fluid from being supplied to the intensive - evaporation region near the contact line .",
    "generally , we assumed throughout this work that the viscous stresses are not important , and this is valid whenever @xmath204 .",
    "in the deposit phase , the velocity is large due to the proximity to the contact - line divergence of the evaporation rate , and the effective viscosity is large due to the high concentration of the solute .",
    "thus , this condition may get violated and the viscosity may become important in the deposit phase , slowing down the supply of the liquid and ultimately making the deposit dry . obviously , this affects the evaporation rate , and the functional form of the evaporation profile changes .",
    "simple assumption that the evaporation rate stays of the same functional form , but with the divergence at the phase boundary ( at @xmath62 ) instead of the contact line ( at @xmath6 ) , was shown above not to affect our main - order results .",
    "thus , our results appear to be relatively insensitive to the exact location of this divergence within the ( narrow ) deposit phase .",
    "( in reality the evaporation edge would be somewhere between the original contact line and the phase boundary , _",
    "i.e. _  the real situation is intermediate between the two considered . )",
    "however , the deposit could modify the evaporation rate @xmath65 in other ways .",
    "when there is a dry deposit ring just outside the liquid phase , the entire functional form of @xmath91 may change , and the laplace equation for an equivalent electrostatic problem must be solved anew with additional boundary conditions responsible for the presence of the dry solute rim and the modified evaporation at the edge . as we already saw in the appendix ,",
    "this is the most complicated part of the problem , and the mathematics can become prohibitively complex .",
    "thus , finding the exact form of @xmath91 may be a formidable task .",
    "one way around is in creating such evaporating conditions that the functional profile is simpler , for instance , @xmath91 is just a constant .",
    "this would be more difficult to control experimentally , but would be much easier to treat analytically .",
    "the unavailability of the exact analytical form for @xmath91 seems to be the biggest open question in this class of problems  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium surface shape of the liquid phase is a spherical cap  ( [ h - finite ] ) .",
    "this is a rigorous result valid during most of the drying process .",
    "however , when @xmath205 becomes negative and exceeds @xmath42 in its absolute value ( _ i.e. _  when the center - point touches the substrate ) , the surface shape is no longer spherical .",
    "moreover , a new element of the contact line is introduced in the center of the drop in addition to the original contact line at the perimeter , and the entire evaporation profile gets modified in addition to the modified surface shape , thus influencing all the other quantities .",
    "our treatment does not account for the small fraction of the drying process occurring after this touchdown ( which is a change in topology of the free surface , and thus requires a separate treatment after it happened ) .",
    "first of all , the amount of liquid remaining in the drop at this moment is of the order of @xmath116 compared to the original volume , and hence it would not modify our main - order analytical results .",
    "second , as our _ numerical _ calculations show , at touchdown practically all the solute is already in the deposit phase , and the remaining amount of solute in the liquid phase is insignificant .",
    "thus , within our model , the remainder of the drying process can not modify the deposit ring substantially , and hence this neglect of the late - time regime seems well justified .",
    "experimentally , the inner part of the deposit ring is different from our prediction ( which is a vertical wall ) and appears to have a spread shelf .",
    "presence of this tail in the deposit distribution can be caused by several features absent in our model .",
    "its inherent two - dimensionality may be one of these shortcomings ( as discussed above ) ; the account for the dynamical processes occurring after the deposit phase has already been formed ( _ e.g. _  avalanches of the inner wall ) may be another missing feature .",
    "absence of the treatment of the late - time regime may be among these reasons influencing the final distribution of the deposit as well . a more detailed account for the effects of this late - time regime",
    "might be required in the future .",

    "the purpose of this section is to obtain the evaporation rate from the free surface of a round sessile drop on the substrate . since presence of the solute is irrelevant to this purpose ( at least for its low concentrations )",
    ", one may assume that the solute is simply absent and the drop is just pure water .",
    "we first consider the generic problem with an arbitrary contact angle @xmath9 , and then find the appropriate limit of interest @xmath10 .",
    "if the radius of the drop footprint on the substrate is @xmath6 , then its surface shape for an arbitrary contact angle is given by @xmath206 despite the fact this problem is two centuries old , some results are presented here in their closed analytical form for the first time , and some correct earlier expressions .",
    "our task involves solution of the equivalent electrostatic problem ( the laplace equation ) for the conductor of the shape of the drop plus its reflection in the plane of the substrate ( kept at constant potential , as a boundary condition ) . in the case of the round drop the shape of this conductor",
    "resembles a symmetrical double - convex lens comprised of two spherical caps .",
    "the system of orthogonal coordinates that matches the symmetry of this object ( so that one of the coordinate surfaces coincides with the surface of the lens ) is called the toroidal coordinates @xmath207 , where coordinates @xmath208 and @xmath209 are related to the cylindrical coordinates @xmath37 and @xmath20 by @xmath210 and the azimuthal angle @xmath24 has the same meaning as in the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "solution to the laplace equation in the toroidal coordinates involves the legendre functions of fractional degree and was derived in a book by lebedev  @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic potential or vapor density is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath24 and reads @xmath211 @xmath212 here @xmath72 is the density of the saturated vapor just above the liquid - air interface ( or the potential of the conductor ) , @xmath73 is the ambient vapor density ( or the value of the potential at infinity ) , and @xmath213 are the legendre functions of the first kind ( they are real valued ) .",
    "the surface of the lens is described by the two coordinate surfaces @xmath214 and @xmath215 , and the @xmath209 derivative is normal to the surface .",
    "the evaporation rate from the surface of the drop is therefore given by @xmath216 where @xmath68 is the diffusion constant and @xmath217 is the metric coefficient in coordinate @xmath209 .",
    "( note that an incorrect expression for @xmath91 with a plus sign in the metric coefficient was used in eq .",

    "is not operable analytically in most cases , as it represents an integral of a non - trivial special function ( which , in its turn , is an integral of some simpler elementary functions ) . in most cases ,",
    "it is necessary to recourse to the asymptotic expansions in the contact angle @xmath9 in order to obtain any meaningful analytical expressions .",
    "however , there is one exception to this general statement .",
    "an important quantity is the total rate of water mass loss by evaporation @xmath222 , which sets the time scale for all the processes .",
    "this total rate can be expressed as an integral of the evaporation rate ( defined as the evaporative mass loss per unit surface area per unit time ) over the surface of the drop : @xmath223 where the first integration is over the substrate area @xmath224 occupied by the drop .",
    "this expression actually involves triple integration : one in the expression above as an integral of @xmath65 , another in the expression for @xmath65 as an integral of the legendre function of the first kind , and the third as an integral representation of the legendre function in terms of the elementary functions .",
    "however , it is possible to simplify the above expression significantly and reduce the number of integrations from three to one .",
