    "there is growing experimental evidence for the emergence of spatial inhomogeneities at the nanoscale in many strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "in addition to charge , other degrees of freedom , such as spin and lattice , typically also play an important role in these materials , leading to the competition of several ground states and the resulting nanoscale phase separation.@xcite such nanophases have been variously described as bubbles , stripes , clumps , clusters , or domains , depending on system details .",
    "other investigations have discussed the emergence of inhomogeneous charge - ordered phases in analogy with the smectic and nematic states in liquid crystals.@xcite in general , many different configurations of such nanoscopic ordered regions often have comparable ( free ) energies , such that these metastable states are separated by barriers with a wide distribution of heights and , thus , relaxation times .",
    "this leads to the slow dynamics typical of glassy or out - of - equilibrium systems .",
    "in fact , the frustration caused by the competition of interactions on different length scales may give rise to the emergence of an exponentially large number of metastable configurations and the associated glassy dynamics even in the absence of disorder.@xcite this scenario is relevant to many materials , including cuprates , where a long - range coulomb repulsion competes with a short - range attraction that results from magnetic exchange interactions .",
    "the disorder should further stabilize the glassy phase . even though the emergence of glassiness thus appears to be almost ubiquitous at low temperatures ( @xmath4 ) , the glassy charge dynamics and out - of - equilibrium behavior in general remain poorly understood .    in cuprates ,",
    "various experimental techniques provide evidence for glassiness in the spin sector at @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spin glass transition temperature and @xmath7 is the doping.@xcite in la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) , where the long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of the parent compound la@xmath10cuo@xmath11 is completely suppressed for @xmath12 but two - dimensional short - range af correlations persist@xcite , the high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) sets in at @xmath13 . the spin glass ( sg ) phase emerges with the first added holes and extends all the way to slightly overdoped @xmath14 ( refs .  ) , thus coexisting with htsc . unlike conventional spin glasses , here the low-@xmath4 phase results from cooperative freezing of moments in different domains in which spins are antiferromagnetically ordered.@xcite",
    "therefore , the spin glass has a local `` stripe '' character and is often called a `` cluster spin glass '' . on the other hand ,",
    "other experiments suggest that charge is clustered in antiphase boundaries @xcite that separate the hole - poor af domains in cuo@xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) planes.@xcite imaging techniques on other cuprates ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .  )",
    "have confirmed the presence of randomly distributed charge domains with short - range order in the underdoped or pseudogap regime .",
    "it is plausible to expect , based on general arguments , that the ground state of such a random distribution of nanoscale charge domains is a charge glass .",
    "the nature of the ground state is clearly of great interest , because it is from this state that the htsc emerges with hole doping .",
    "however , studies of charge glassiness , _",
    "i.e. _ of _ dynamic _ as opposed to static charge ordering , have been relatively scarce.@xcite moreover , experiments at relatively high @xmath4 may be difficult to interpret in many materials because of the changes in structural or magnetic symmetry . at low @xmath4 ,",
    "on the other hand , the charge dynamics may become so slow that the charge distribution appears to be static on experimental time scales .",
    "therefore , the resistance noise spectroscopy employed at very low @xmath4 and on very long time ( @xmath16 ) scales is clearly a technique that is well suited for probing the charge dynamics .",
    "it has already been used successfully in charge ( coulomb ) glasses in nonmagnetic systems.@xcite the analysis of the noise statistics can provide evidence for the presence of a large number of metastable states , which are an essential prerequisite for well - known dynamical features of glassiness , such as aging , memory , and breaking of ergodicity .    in lsco , the noise has been measured in the @xmath17-axis or out - of - plane resistance @xmath18 of the @xmath19 sample,@xcite which is located in the pseudogap regime , but it does not superconduct at any @xmath4 ( fig .

    "this positive mr ( pmr ) shows a hysteresis and memory , indicative of the presence of correlated magnetic domains . a careful and comprehensive analysis of the data@xcite points to the picture of af domains that are frozen at low @xmath20 , and holes confined to the domain `` walls ''",
    "( _ i.e. _ patchy areas separating the af domains ) .",
    "while low @xmath22 produces some motion of the domain walls leading to a hysteretic mr , the main transport mechanism that gives rise to the pmr remains unchanged and , in fact , is the same as that observed in various nonmagnetic , disordered materials with strong coulomb interactions .",
    "basically , in a system that conducts via variable - range hopping ( vrh ) , the zeeman splitting in the presence of a coulomb repulsion between two holes in the same disorder - localized state leads to a pmr by blocking certain hopping channels.@xcite much higher @xmath22 leads to the reorientation of the weak ferromagnetic ( fm ) moments@xcite associated with each af domain and oriented along the @xmath17 axis , resulting in a negative mr.@xcite therefore , since the magnetic background for a fixed @xmath22 is frozen at @xmath20 , at least on experimental time scales , only holes in the domain walls contribute to transport and glassiness in the resistance noise .",
    "for this reason , the statistics of the @xmath18 noise , which reflects a collective wandering of the system among many metastable states , is unaffected by the presence of a fixed @xmath22 , and it is also independent of the magnetic history.@xcite    while the previous study of the @xmath18 noise in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 strongly suggests@xcite that the doped holes form a cluster glass state as a result of coulomb interactions , albeit in the presence of a frozen , random magnetic background , the noise in the in - plane transport has not been investigated .",
    "in addition , only the effect of @xmath23 was explored .",
    "however , the in - plane transport is generally agreed to be more relevant to the physics of cuprates and , in particular , to the emergence of htsc at higher charge - carrier concentrations .",
    "furthermore , various theoretical models , such as those that consider fluctuations of the local electronic order and the effect on transport noise,@xcite have focused on the in - plane transport and in - plane symmetry breaking .",
    "it should be noted that the relationship between the in - plane and out - of - plane transport in these highly anisotropic materials is far from trivial , and their sometimes contrasting behavior has been one of the most unusual characteristics of the cuprates .",
    "indeed , comparative studies of intralayer and interlayer properties continue to provide key insights into the physics of these strongly correlated systems.@xcite    therefore , here we investigate the noise in the in - plane resistance @xmath24 of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 at very low @xmath20 and with @xmath25 .",
    "just like what was observed@xcite for the @xmath17-axis transport and a different field orientation ( @xmath23 ) , the fluctuations of the in - plane resistance @xmath24 with time provide evidence for the increasingly slow , correlated dynamics as @xmath3 . here , however , the magnitude of the resistance noise is significantly smaller and the emergence of charge glassiness takes place at even lower @xmath4 than for the out - of - plane transport . in spite of these quantitative differences ,",
    "the overall data strongly support earlier conclusions@xcite and provide evidence that doped holes in lightly doped lsco form a collective , glassy state of charge domains or clusters located in cuo@xmath10 planes .",

    "electrical contacts were made by evaporating gold on polished crystal surfaces , followed by annealing in air at @xmath28c . for current contacts ,",
    "the whole area of two opposing side faces was covered with gold to ensure a uniform current flow through the sample . in turn , the voltage contacts were made narrow ( @xmath29 m ) in order to minimize the uncertainty in the absolute values of the resistance .",
    "gold leads were attached to the sample using dupont 6838 silver paste .",
    "this was followed by the heat treatment at @xmath30c in the flow of oxygen for 6 minutes .",
    "the resulting contact resistances were less than 1  @xmath31 at room @xmath4 .",
    "the sample resistance was measured using the standard four - probe ac technique ( typically at @xmath32  hz ) in the ohmic regime , at @xmath4 down to 0.05  k realized in a dilution refrigerator .",

    "for example , it was confirmed experimentally that the correlation between @xmath4 and voltage fluctuations decreases and becomes negligible as the balance of the bridge is increased .",
    "likewise , the correlation between the fluctuations of voltage and current was also negligible .",
    "two lock - in amplifiers ( @xmath34 hz ) were used to detect the difference voltage .",

    "therefore , this result further supports the picture of spatial segregation of holes into interacting , hole - rich droplets or clusters , which are separated by hole - poor af domains .",
    "these _ dynamic _ charge inhomogeneities thus result from the competition of short - range interactions , revealed by @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lscoabscalingzerofield6tfield ] ) , and a long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "our measurements of the in - plane resistance noise in @xmath19 lsco have demonstrated the emergence of slow , correlated dynamics and nonergodic behavior at very low @xmath20 .",
    "the gradual enhancement of this glassy behavior with decreasing temperature strongly suggests that the phase transition to a charge glass state occurs at @xmath103 .",
    "several findings in our study can be used to rule out spins as the origin of the observed glasslike behavior .",
    "for example , the resistance noise spectroscopy reveals that the significant arrest of the charge motion in cuo@xmath10 planes occurs only at @xmath104  k ( _ i.e. _ deep inside the spin - glass phase ) .",
    "furthermore , while both in - plane and out - of - plane resistance are strongly affected by the magnetic field,@xcite all the noise characteristics are insensitive to both the magnetic field and the magnetic history , further indicating that the observed glassiness reflects the dynamics of charge , not spins .",
    "this is analogous to the magnetic insensitivity of the noise in a glassy , fully spin - polarized 2d electron system.@xcite we note that in conventional spin glasses , by contrast , all the resistance noise characteristics are affected by @xmath22.@xcite    therefore , this study provides evidence for the existence of a cluster charge glass ground state in @xmath19 lsco , in agreement with the conclusions based on noise measurements on @xmath17-axis oriented samples@xcite , dielectric@xcite , and magnetotransport@xcite studies .",
    "the strong non - gaussianity of the noise indicates that the dynamics of charge clusters can not be attributed merely to the switching between frozen and non - frozen states of individual clusters ( tss ) with different characteristics , but rather that the charge clusters are correlated .",
    "although they affect the interlayer or @xmath17-axis transport,@xcite here we have shown that the correlated charge clusters are located in cuo@xmath10 planes , where they seem to coexist with hole - poor af domains that remain frozen at very low temperatures @xmath20 , at least on experimental time scales .",
