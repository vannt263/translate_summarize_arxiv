    "in the past few years there has been great research interest in the field of string phenomenology , dealing with the question of stabilizing moduli fields at desirably high masses ( for a comprehensive review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this was initiated by the kklt scenario @xcite which suggested a way to obtain stabilized vacua from type iib string theory building on earlier works such as @xcite .",
    "presently , one can find many extensions and improvements of the original idea , the most notable and well established of which is the large volume scenario ( lvs ) @xcite .",
    "it builds up on the kklt solutions by allowing for non - supersymmetric vacua and by including perturbative corrections to the tree - level khler potential computed in @xcite . up to now",
    "the lvs has passed many consistency checks ( e.g. @xcite ) , but there is nevertheless much space for improvement .",
    "the stabilization of the khler moduli requires manifolds with negative euler number , as well as non - perturbative effects which appear only if certain conditions are satisfied @xcite . and",
    "it is of course desirable to have a working recipe also for the other cases .",
    "the process of uplifting to a minkowski or de sitter vacuum also needs to be understood better because at present it seems that unnatural fine tuning of parameters is necessary .    in this paper",
    "we propose another extension , namely the stabilization of moduli fields that arise from the two - form r - r and ns - ns fields in type iib string theory .",
    "these are usually neglected in the literature , where the main focus is on stabilizing the volume of the underlying manifold to large enough values . here",
    "we will argue that the stabilization of these so called axionic or non - geometric moduli is an important step in drawing the full picture .",
    "we show that these axions may lead to changes in the process of stabilization of the manifold volume and the other moduli .",
    "additional motivation for considering them are the possible cosmological consequences from their existence - they are good candidates for driving inflation as recently suggested in @xcite . here",
    "we will try to put these considerations on a firm ground , first showing explicitly the existence of a large number of flux compactifications in f - theory that include axions .",
    "these are afterwards translated to the type iib compactifications on calabi - yau orientifolds , where the analysis of moduli stabilization is better understood",
    ". then we will be able to generalize the existing stabilization techniques in order to accommodate for the new moduli .",
    "for this reason we first try to give a brief introduction to type iib flux compactifications in section [ flux ] , including the axions in the general discussion . in section [ tree_level ]",
    "we discuss the stabilization procedure at tree level .",
    "we then show how stabilization changes after including perturbative and d@xmath5-instanton corrections , in sections [ alpha-corrections ] and [ d3-instantons ] respectively .",
    "we comment on both the supersymmetric ( kklt ) and non - supersymmetric ( lvs ) type of vacua . based on @xcite",
    "we are also able to estimate the importance of the worldsheet instantons on the moduli potential in section [ worldsheet instantons ] and we see that the @xmath1-moduli might substantially alter the moduli stabilization procedure in the large volume limit .",
    "we conclude by listing the possible applications of the axion moduli and suggestions for further research in section [ conc ] . some of the more technical calculations used in the main text are carried out in the appendices .",
    "we will first briefly review flux compactifications of type iib string theory establishing the basic conventions and equations that will be used later .",
    "the particle content of the type iib supergravity is derived from the massless spectrum of the corresponding superstring type .",
    "the fermionic part consists of two left - handed majorana - weyl gravitinos and two right - handed majorana - weyl dilatinos .",
    "as supersymmetry holds and all fermionic degrees of freedom correspond exactly to bosonic ones , specifying either part of the effective action completely determines the other one . in this case",
    "there are @xmath7 supersymmetry generators , i.e. we are in the case of @xmath8 supergravity in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "we will then concentrate on the bosonic part from here on , keeping in mind the fermionic counterparts . in the bosonic spectrum we have ns - ns and r - r bosons .",
    "the ns - ns bosons are the metric @xmath10 , a two - form @xmath1 ( with corresponding field strength @xmath11 ) and the dilaton @xmath12 .",
    "the r - r sector consists of corresponding form fields @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , the latter having a self - dual field strength @xmath15 ( also @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) . in order to obtain four dimensional models with @xmath18",
    "we need to compactify the theory on calabi - yau orientifold where fluxes are turned on under the conditions :    @xmath19    with @xmath20 three - cycles on the manifold .",
    "the resulting metric becomes a warped product of flat four - dimensional spacetime and conformally calabi - yau orientifold .",
    "the compactification as described in this picture essentially requires a calabi - yau three - fold with @xmath21 orientifold planes , @xmath22 branes and the fluxes from ( [ fluxes ] ) .",
    "there is however another description of the same physical situation if one considers f - theory on an elliptically fibered calabi - yau four - fold @xcite .",
    "there one needs to add only @xmath23 branes and fluxes and the theory is equivalent to the one of type iib flux compactification . since in this way one obtains the orientifold `` for free '' without the need of explicitly constructing @xmath21 projection as in the type iib picture , the f - theory approach is widely used for realistic constructions .",
    "the rules of translating between the two pictures are simple to use .",
    "a detailed summary can be found in section 4.1 of @xcite . here",
    "we will need to know that ( @xmath24 ) corresponds to @xmath25 and @xmath26 to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the hodge numbers on the calabi - yau orientifold counting the even resp .",
    "odd parts of the ( @xmath29)-homology under the orientifold projection .",
    "the tadpole cancellation condition that needs to be satisfied in the f - theory picture is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the euler number of the four - fold . in the type iib picture",
    "this number effectively collects the contribution to the @xmath23 brane charge from the orientifold planes and the @xmath32 branes .",
    "clearly , @xmath33 needs to be divisible by @xmath34 , which puts a restriction on the space of elliptic four - folds that can be used for compactification ( not too strict one since @xmath35 ) .",
    "the resulting effective field theory corresponds to a standard @xmath18 supergravity with number of scalar ( moduli ) fields counted by the hodge numbers .",
    "the kklt and lvs scenarios , as well as the vast literature on the subject of type iib moduli stabilization , focus the attention on breaking the no - scale structure of the potential and on stabilizing the khler moduli at a value where the internal manifold has a large volume as consistency requires . in this process",
    "the non - geometric khler moduli are usually completely disregarded and assumed non - existent .",
    "this is only justified in special cases for orientifold projections where @xmath36 , as otherwise we have additional moduli coming from the 2-form fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the type iib low energy effective action .",
    "one can find many examples of calabi - yau four - folds leading to both @xmath37 and @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "@xcite or table b.4 of @xcite - keep in mind that @xmath38 ) .    for a generic manifold ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the moduli to be stabilized in the theory are the axio - dilaton @xmath39 ( from here on referred to simply as dilaton ) , @xmath40 complex scalars @xmath41 parametrizing the size of the surviving three - cycles appearing in ( [ fluxes ] ) , the khler moduli : @xmath42 and the corresponding axionic moduli @xmath43 from the four - form @xmath14 : @xmath44 with @xmath45 the basis of harmonic @xmath46-forms , dual to the @xmath47 basis @xmath48 that is even under the orientifold projection .",
    "the additional moduli entering the effective four - dimensional field theory because of @xmath27 are : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the basis of harmonic @xmath47 forms that are odd under the orientifold projection . in the above formulae",
    ", @xmath51 denotes the four - dimensional space - time where all the moduli ( and we ) live , and @xmath52 are the coordinates on the compact six - dimensional internal manifold .    with these definitions ,",
    "the khler metric on the space of moduli fields is given in terms of the reduced complex structure coordinates coming from the explicit manifold and in terms of the dilaton , the khler and the axionic moduli arranged as follows @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , i.e. it is just a four - cycle volume ( with a different normalization compared to the standard literature , used for simplicity ) . in this notation , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the volume of the manifold already after the orientifold projection .",
    "the numbers @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the usual calabi - yau intersection numbers after performing the orientifold projection . as explained in @xcite , in the process of orientifolding consistency",
    "requires that only the intersection numbers with even number of latin indices are non - zero .",
    "this means that for all @xmath59 , @xmath60 has to hold",
    ". the explicit construction of orientifolds with such properties might not be straightforward .",
    "however , we need not worry about this issue since orientifolding is performed implicitly from the f - theory picture and thus consistency is guaranteed .",
    "the standard @xmath61 f - term potential supergravity .",
    "these generally appear whenever there are charged chiral fields in the effective action . in principle",
    "this happens when one tries to reproduce the mssm by adding d@xmath62-branes @xcite , but here we strictly concentrate on moduli stabilization and therefore neglect the possibility for a d - term potential . ] for the moduli fields is given by : @xmath63 where the indices @xmath64 run over all chiral fields ( the ones defined through ( [ real kaehler coordinates ] ) together with the complex structure moduli @xmath41 ) , the matrix @xmath65 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . here",
    ", the khler potential @xmath4 and the superpotential @xmath6 are functions of the moduli fields in a particular way that will be discussed separately in the following sections . once @xmath4 and @xmath6 are known , the moduli potential @xmath68 can be calculated and the minima to which the moduli fields roll down and get stabilized can be found in principle .    from the above definitions , we see that : @xmath69 had we assumed that @xmath36 the additional @xmath70-dependent term would vanish and everything would be the same as in @xcite",
    ", so we see that the results in the literature are consistent with the neglect of the non - geometric moduli .",
    "however , if we really want to stabilize all moduli in the generic case where @xmath71 we need to use the coordinate basis given by ( [ real kaehler coordinates ] ) .",
    "we will then describe in detail what happens in this case and show how all these moduli will be eventually stabilized in a manner similar to the kklt and lvs procedures . in what follows",
    "we separately discuss the resulting moduli potential and its stabilization for the tree - level case , and for the cases with added perturbative @xmath3-corrections to @xmath4 and then d@xmath5-instantons to @xmath6 . in the end we will be also able to draw conclusions on how the addition of worldsheet instanton corrections to the khler potential can influence the stabilization process .",
    "note that once we derive the moduli potential from the khler metric in the basis of chiral fields @xmath72 , we will be able to switch to the basis of real scalars @xmath73 using ( [ real kaehler coordinates ] ) .",
    "it will turn out that minimization of the potential is easier in this new basis since the volume of the calabi - yau @xmath74 will depend only on the two - cycle moduli @xmath75 and not on the other scalars .",
    "of course , once having stabilized all scalars one can always switch back to the initial chiral fields where the metric on the moduli space takes a simpler form . for additional clarity we present table [ table ] , listing the chiral and real fields that appear in this work , their multiplicity and associated indices .",
    ".multiplicity of chiral and real moduli .",

    "another correction to the khler potential is given by worldsheet instantons wrapping holomorphic 2-cycles on the internal manifold .",
    "it is inherited from the type iia @xmath8 prepotential @xcite , given by here and leads to the same form of the khler potential . ] : @xmath76 with @xmath77 where @xmath78 is as defined in ( [ xi ] ) , @xmath79 are the usual intersection numbers , @xmath80 , @xmath81 before orientifolding are introduced for a clear distinction between the @xmath18 variables of section [ flux ] and the ones used here at @xmath8 . ] , and @xmath82 has to be set to @xmath83 after obtaining the khler potential .",
    "the numbers @xmath84 are the genus zero topological invariants of gopakumar - vafa @xcite , associated with each element of the homology .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is the prepotential for the vector multiplets of type iia at tree - level of string - loop expansion that receives both perturbative and non - perturbative corrections in @xmath3 . it can be translated to the type iib orientifold picture by the classical c - map @xcite with the new coordinates @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see also e.g. @xcite for more details on how this works ) . the relevant part of the khler potential can then be calculated directly by @xmath88 where the final result for @xmath4 needs to be expressed as before in terms of the chiral fields of section [ flux ] . using this",
    ", we finally obtain in the einstein frame @xmath89 with @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the harmonic @xmath47-forms that are odd under the orientifold projection and @xmath93 are the corresponding 2-cycles .",
    "the contributions from the even @xmath47-forms are exponentially suppressed with the @xmath75 s and we can safely neglect them .",
    "this new khler potential includes infinite ( converging ) sum over @xmath94 and another sum over the elements of the homology @xmath95 of the cy manifold .",
    "this makes the metric very hard to invert and we can not present a generic inverse of @xmath96 that is manifold independent as was the case before .",
    "however , we can use the intuition from previous results to draw quite generic conclusion on how worldsheet instantons can influence the moduli stabilization .",
    "note that the corrections are subleading in volume , @xmath97 therefore the worldsheet instantons will appear in the end result the same way as the perturbative corrections , i.e. in the definition of the @xmath98 term ( see eqs.([roughly approximated potential ] ) and ( [ beta of b ] ) )",
    ". they would be too subleading to influence the @xmath99 terms in ( [ roughly approximated potential ] ) .",
    "if we consider more closely the dependence of @xmath100 , we see that its extrema can be given by the condition @xmath101 for an integer number @xmath102 .",
    "in fact @xmath100 is maximized for @xmath103 and minimized whenever @xmath104 for every cycle @xmath93 . if indeed @xmath105 for all @xmath93 , then both @xmath106 and @xmath107 vanish .",
    "so in this case we can effectively consider @xmath100 to be constant for the purpose of obtaining analogs of ( [ inverse full kaehler metric alpha corrections to a satisfactory precision ] ) and ( [ break into sums alpha corr ] ) that eventually determine the expression for @xmath98 .",
    "then the khler metric can be again inverted analytically is precise upto order @xmath108 , i.e. the inverse metric is analytic at leading order .",
    "this is all we need since we are working under the assumption of large volume .",
    "the khler metric can not be inverted to all orders due to the fact that e.g. @xmath109 does not vanish at the minimum .",
    "] just by adding the constant @xmath110 to the existing @xmath78 in the formulae in app .",
    "[ appalpha ] . for the minimum of @xmath100",
    "we get : @xmath111 the minimization of @xmath100 means minimization of the full potential as it decreases the value of the @xmath98 term : @xmath112 note that in the case when @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , @xmath100 is maximized and the sign in front of the instanton sum in ( [ beta corrected by worldsheet instantons ] ) flips .",
    "this will make @xmath115 much less likely to be a minimum of the potential , e.g. ( [ sec derivatives roughly approximated potential ] ) and ( [ minim v in b - directions with many small cycles ] ) will be corrected with the negative sum over gopakumar - vafa ( gv ) invariants . in case it is large enough , the sum will make sure that @xmath116 is in fact a maximum . and the minimum will certainly be at a point which decreases @xmath98 .",
    "if the @xmath98 term decreases so much that it becomes negative we will no longer have any consistent minima in the volume direction as discussed in sections [ alpha-corrections ] and [ d3-instantons ] .",
    "@xmath117 is absolutely crucial for the existence of lvs minima , while supersymmetric kklt minima can exist independently of the sign of @xmath98 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath98 is positive of the order of @xmath99 we will only have small volume minima in the lvs .",
    "so one can only hope that the 2-cycles of the manifold do not allow for larger values of the gv invariants and thus of the worldsheet instanton corrections as this can spoil the whole process of moduli stabilization .",
    "the case @xmath118 might still enable the existence of desired minima for small positive @xmath98 , but this does not seem to be possible for many supersymmetric cycles as seen in subsection [ many smalls ] .",
    "the above discussion is in fact quite general and does not necessarily have to hold only for the special points in @xmath119-moduli space that minimize @xmath100 , although these are the cases that can be handled analytically ( as long as the inverse khler metric is concerned ) . even for generic values of the @xmath120 s at the minimum of the potential where we also get corrections from @xmath121 , the @xmath98 term will tend to decrease as all terms in @xmath98 coming from worldsheet corrections will necessarily be periodic and therefore allowed to become negative , @xmath98 will necessarily be stabilized negative as this ensures the minimum of the potential is at very large negative values @xmath122 and very small manifold volumes .",
    "this is of course not an acceptable vacuum as it contradicts all assumptions of our construction . ] .",
    "note that in fact the worldsheet instantons are the leading term that exhibits @xmath120-dependence .",
    "the tree - level term from section [ tree_level ] is suppressed by @xmath123 compared to @xmath100 , and therefore we expect that ( even without having any d@xmath5-instantons ) the @xmath120 s are stabilized away from zero , unless the gv invariants are small . thus the volume will be usually stabilized at a lower value as compared to section [ d3-instantons ] , due to the decrease in the @xmath98 term . as we see the risk for the stability of the lvs minima after adding worldsheet instantons is very general and one needs to explicitly calculate the invariants @xmath84 in order to make sure phenomenologically accepted vacua are still present in a given model .",
    "even if this is so , the second type of generic vacuum in table [ tab2 ] is the most plausible ( and least well controlled ) outcome .",
    "we made some progress towards full stabilization of the scalar fields in the compactification of type iib string theory on calabi - yau orientifolds with @xmath0 .",
    "as seen , the search for supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric minima of the moduli potential is a nontrivial task .",
    "many approximations and simplifications are employed in the process and it is not always granted that these are justified in all possible models .",
    "clearly , perturbative and non - perturbative corrections play an important role and it is unfortunate that at present there is no full classification of possible terms that can appear in the khler potential and the superpotential .    nevertheless , in the literature one can find extensive discussion of quantum corrections and their regime of importance , i.e. how suppressed they are with the volume .",
    "references @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite study this topic in detail and show that string loop corrections for `` swiss - cheese '' cy manifolds are subleading compared to the perturbative and non - perturbative @xmath3-corrections so they only help stabilizing the non - supersymmetric 4-cycle volumes , but there may be other types of manifolds for which this is not satisfied .",
    "other possible perturbative @xmath3-corrections are known to be less important compared to the ones discussed in the lvs , i.e. it seems that the lvs is safe from further perturbative @xmath3 and @xmath124 corrections .",
    "however , there might be other corrections from dbi actions and @xmath61 supergravity that are of importance ( see e.g. section 6 and 7 of @xcite for more details ) . if we are to claim that realistic string compactifications have been found , a better understanding of all quantum corrections is needed .",
    "needless to say , same holds for instanton corrections to @xmath6 and @xmath4 - as seen in the previous section worldsheet instantons have the potential to break down the lvs .    despite these shortcomings",
    ", we managed to show with certainty that all @xmath120 s are stabilized already at tree level with instanton corrections possibly changing their vevs and lifting their masses , and that the @xmath43 s and ( some of ) the @xmath125 s are stabilized if d@xmath5-instanton effects contribute to the moduli potential of the given model .",
    "the above is true under the condition that the manifold volume is stabilized large , which ultimately depends on the topological data for the manifold and the stabilization of the complex structure moduli that appear implicitly in the @xmath126 , @xmath98 , and @xmath127 terms defined through ( [ roughly approximated potential])-([gamma of b ] )",
    ". therefore our procedure works for a subset of all minima that one can find in the landscape of vacua , i.e. for those cases that produce the desired relative weights of @xmath128 as discussed in section [ d3-instantons ] .",
    "how large this subset is depends on the specific calabi - yau manifold , which also determines the type of perturbative and non - perturbative corrections that should be considered .",
    "so in the end everything can be determined from the topological structure of the compactification manifold as expected .",
    "it seems that at present the full generality of the construction defined in section [ flux ] is exhausted and one needs to go to specific examples in order to obtain more explicit results that can be used for predictive purposes .",
    "we will now try to briefly describe some applications that make use of these axionic moduli @xcite . in type iib",
    "the axions arise from the @xmath129-form fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the @xmath130-form field @xmath14 as given by eqs .",

    "there are a few ideas to employ these scalars for phenomenological purposes .",
    "one scenario , developed initially by peccei and quinn @xcite , proposes that a massive scalar field ( an axion ) provides a solution to the cp problem in qcd .",
    "reference @xcite discusses in detail whether the missing peccei - quinn axion can be coming from the @xmath14-moduli .",
    "the present work might help answering this question also for the @xmath131-axions . to study this",

    "another possibility to use axions is for driving inflation in the early universe @xcite ( also called n - flation ) . in @xcite and @xcite the n - flation scenario with type iib axions",
    "was considered and made plausible in some specific toy models .",
    "therefore our work extends the possibility to study this idea as it provides a more systematic approach to the subject .",
    "we leave this for future research .",

    "here we will present in detail how to deal with inverting the matrix of partial derivatives @xmath132 after including the non - geometric moduli .",
    "we will not consider the complex structure moduli dependence , as they are not coupled to the dilaton and the other moduli in @xmath4 : @xmath133    @xmath134 can not be inverted explicitly without a given model , so we focus on inverting @xmath96 .",
    "we will show that , although rather non - trivial , there is an exact analytic solution for the inverse metric @xmath135 both at tree level and with perturbative @xmath3-corrections included .",

    "we will then consider all possible cases of scaling of @xmath98 and @xmath127 with @xmath51 ( @xmath126 does not really depend on @xmath51 since any change in the @xmath120 s only changes the value of @xmath183 at its minimum and leaves @xmath126 the same ) .",
    "so ,      where we implicitly absorbed additional constants in the definitions of @xmath185 in order to simplify notation and without any loss of generality .",
    "note that here @xmath128 are always strictly positive , while @xmath186 ( for a completely generic matrix @xmath187 ) and @xmath188 . since @xmath189",
    "we can not really picture it , but we will present three slices of @xmath68 at different values of @xmath51 : @xmath190 and @xmath191",
    ". then we will be able to draw conclusions on how the potential looks everywhere .    * @xmath192 : + @xmath193 since @xmath194 is always positive ( in this limit it is in fact going to positive infinity )",
    ", we see that for all values of @xmath195 the potential remains positive and vanishes from above when @xmath172 . * @xmath196 : + @xmath197 here the standard lvs is reproduced , the potential @xmath68 is large positive for small values of @xmath195 , then goes below zero as they increase , and approaches zero asymptotically from below as @xmath172 .",
    "the minimum of the potential is at @xmath198 and some finite value of @xmath56 that depends on the coefficients and is not relevant for the argument here .",
    "* @xmath199 : + @xmath200 this case is particularly subtle and we need to split it into a few subcases . + for finite @xmath201 we see that the last term is largely dominant as it rises squarely faster than the first term .",
    "this makes the potential always positive for finite values of the volume .",
    "when @xmath202 the second term will make sure the potential never goes negative . + on the other hand , when @xmath201 goes faster to @xmath203 than @xmath51 the second term will dominate everywhere and the potential is positive and only vanishing as @xmath172 .",
    "+ the most subtle case is when @xmath201 goes to infinity together with @xmath51 .",
    "then , @xmath204 will remain finite and @xmath205 consider @xmath206 .",
    "@xmath199 only when at least one of the @xmath120 s goes to infinity .",
    "but then , since @xmath207 is negative definite , @xmath208 will necessarily also become infinite .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath199 the second term will always scale as @xmath209 ( remember that @xmath140 ) .",
    "the scaling of @xmath210 is less clear , but this is not important for our argument .",
    "we can even neglect the @xmath127 term completely ( since in any case it gives a positive contribution ) and still prove our point .",
    "the potential is then simply @xmath211 with the @xmath51-dependence hidden in @xmath212 .",
    "then it is straightforward to minimize the potential in the volume direction , and the value of the potential at the minimum is @xmath213 the minimum of the potential increases with @xmath51 , so although @xmath68 can be ( infinitesimally ) negative , its real minimum will not be at @xmath199 but at some finite value of @xmath51 .",
    "we have exhausted the limiting cases and showed there is no runaway direction for @xmath51 and it must remain finite in order to minimize @xmath68 . and for finite fixed @xmath214 the potential will have no runaway directions in the @xmath201 and @xmath56 directions .",
    "this is the case because the standard lvs ( @xmath215 ) behavior of the potential will still hold , only that for @xmath216 the relative weight between the coefficients @xmath217 will change , effectively changing the values of @xmath195 at the corresponding ads minimum .",
    "since @xmath218 always remains positive , @xmath195 will be finite at the minimum and the minimum itself will be at a finite value @xmath219 ( c.f . appendix a of @xcite for a detailed proof ) .",
    "now we can safely claim that in all cases the full potential @xmath220 will be minimized at a point or points inside the domain of the variables , i.e. @xmath182 will all have finite values at the minima .",
    "we are unable to specify the number of minima , but we know there will be at least one since the minimum of the potential is finite and negative at the lvs slice @xmath221 , while on the boundaries of its domain it is positive or vanishing .",
    "this concludes our proof for the existence of minima of ( [ roughly approximated potential ] ) .",
