    "in a recent paper @xcite we introduced a linked - cluster algorithm , which we called the numerical linked - cluster ( nlc ) algorithm , that allows one to obtain temperature - dependent properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit from the exact diagonalization of small clusters . a detailed exposition of nlc and its application to quantum spin models on square , triangular , and kagom lattices has been presented in ref .",
    "there we have shown that for many spin models and thermodynamic quantities nlc results can be substantially more accurate than hte and exact diagonalization ( ed ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how to use nlc to calculate properties of strongly correlated itinerant models .",
    "in particular , we study the thermodynamics of the planar @xmath0-@xmath1 model on the square lattice .",
    "this model was introduced by anderson and others @xcite as a means to understanding the microscopic mechanism for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is one of the simplest models that allows one to study the interplay between itinerancy of electrons and their spin fluctuations , possibly leading to superconductivity and many other exotic quantum phases @xcite .    in spite of its simplicity ,",
    "understanding finite - temperature thermodynamic properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model has proven to be a very challenging task @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations suffer from severe sign problems , which become a major difficulty at low temperatures .",
    "the two general approaches that have been commonly used to study this model are ed and hte .",
    "ed studies in which one fully diagonalizes the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian are difficult since they can only be done for very small systems @xcite , as a consequence of which finite size effects are very large . a more efficient approach to this problem is the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) , which has been developed by jakli and prelovek ( jp ) @xcite . within this approach",
    "the full thermodynamic trace is reduced by randomly sampling the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "this allows one to study larger systems sizes in an unbiased way , but still finite size effects become relevant as the temperature is lowered .    in order to obtain results in the thermodynamic limit one can use high - temperature expansions ( hte ) @xcite . within this method the properties of the system are expanded in powers of the inverse temperature @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these expansions , carried out to order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is of order 10 , provide accurate numerical results within the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "the temperature scale where hte converges can be rather high for @xmath0-@xmath1 models .",
    "it is typically set by @xmath0 when @xmath8 . beyond the region of convergence ,",
    "series extrapolation methods @xcite allow one to calculate thermodynamic properties , but their reliability remains uncertain . because the region of convergence is small in inverse temperature , extrapolations even to temperatures of order @xmath1 are more sensitive to the choice of the extrapolation method and variables and hence less reliable than for purely spin models .    here",
    ", we study thermodynamic properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model using nlc .",
    "the basic idea is to show with examples the advantages and disadvantages of nlc as compared with ftlm and hte , and the region of temperatures that within nlc can be accessed for the different observables of interest .",
