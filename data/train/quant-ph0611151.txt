    "note that given @xmath331 lmis constraints @xmath332 , we can always combine them to a single new lmi constraint as : @xmath333 the operator @xmath91 can always be expressed as @xmath334 because of the following reason : suppose , for instance , that a given set of measurement operators @xmath335 do not form a set of operator basis elements .",
    "then , one can find the minimal set of linear independent measurement operators and then apply the gram - schmidt orthogonalization to these elements in order to obtain a minimal set of linear independent operator basis elements .",
    "moreover , from the original data @xmath1 , it is straightforward to compute the observed probability distribution for these new operators . as a result ,",
