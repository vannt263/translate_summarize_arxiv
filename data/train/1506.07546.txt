    "the interplay between mass loss and accretion in pre - main sequence systems is important in determining both the final stellar mass , the mass in the disk available to form planets , and the local physical conditions ( e.g. incident uv flux , temperature ) affecting planet formation and evolution . while many details of the physical mechanisms involved in mass accretion and mass outflow in the immediate circumstellar environments ( @xmath2@xmath30.1 au ) for low  mass class ii pre  main sequence stars , or classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , are now understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the investigations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all examined samples of @xmath530 haebes and a small or medium number of spectral line diagnostics . @xcite and @xcite compare their samples to known tts characteristics but these studies focus mainly on pure emission line morphologies and not on red and blue  shifted absorption .",

    "high spectral resolution observations of a wide range of accretion and outflow diagnostics in a large sample of haebes is clearly needed .    besides the studies listed above , most optical spectroscopic haebe studies have focused on single objects or small sample sizes and a small number of spectral line diagnostics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite pointed out that in order for magnetospheric accretion to operate around haebes , the large @xmath8sin@xmath9 values of haebes require the corotation radii , and thus the magnetic truncation radii , to be closer to the stellar surface than in cttss .",

    "this includes simultaneous red and blue  shifted detections in the same line , such as that seen in for the cttss from @xcite , or detections in two different lines as seen in @xcite .",

    "the lack of simultaneous absorption features observed in our optical sample supports the arguments presented in , namely that accretion driven outflows in haebes may be more difficult to produce .",
    "the strong optical outflow signatures observed in both hae and hbe objects that do not also exhibit red  shifted absorption , combined with the conclusion from that the pc morphologies are likely accretion  driven , suggests that accretion in some haebes may proceed through a non ",
    "magnetic mechanism such as a boundary layer .",
    "this would explain the relative lack of simultaneous red and blue  shifted absorption signatures in haebes compared to cttss .",
    "it is still unclear whether or not the accretion flows detected in the red  shifted absorption objects can drive outflows .",
    "outflow signatures in these objects are not observed ( except for hd 163296 ) suggesting that if the accretion is related to driving outflows , the outflow signatures are too weak to be detected or are launched in a geometry that requires a specific viewing angle to observe ( e.g. a highly collimated jet emerging from the polar region ) .",
    "this seems unlikely since these simultaneous signatures are almost entirely absent from our sample , suggesting that they are present in very few objects .",
    "indeed , jets have been detected in a relatively fewer number of haebes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to cttss hinting that they do not form as efficiently in haebes .",
    "one potential explanation is that , in general , the accreting material as traced by red  shifted absorption is not energetic enough to provide the energy necessary to drive an outflow .",
    "support for this idea is seen in from this study and figure 5 from where the red  shifted absorption velocities of haebes are found to be smaller fractions of their stellar escape velocities .",
    "we also find support for this scenario in figure 7 from which demonstrates the relative lack of objects with low accretion rates that also exhibit blue  shifted absorption profiles .",
    "we note that this distinction is not clear in our optical data , i.e. the separation of profile type with accretion rate is not distinct .",
    "we have fewer estimates of @xmath18 in hand , however , for the red  shifted absorption objects from the optical sample and thus the comparison is less significant .",
    "this could be improved and further tested by obtaining simultaneous line profile morphologies and accretion rate estimates for a large sample of haebes .",
    "the idea of accretion powered stellar winds was first proposed for cttss by @xcite .",
    "they suggest that a portion of the deposited accretion energy will heat the corona ( via conduction or magnetosonic wave dissipation ) and assist in launching stellar winds .",
    "while it is unclear whether or not this process is occurring in cttss , magnetically channeled accretion , involving smaller magnetospheres in haebes compared to cttss , will provide a smaller fraction of the necessary energy for launching an outflow from the stellar surface of haebes than from the surface of cttss . since the outflows observed in cttss are generally accepted to be driven largely by accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amount of energy deposited by the accretion flow onto the stellar surface could strongly influence the strength of the outflow . for haebes ,",
    "if we imagine that all of the kinetic energy of the accretion flow is converted into kinetic energy in a wind driven from very near the stellar surface ( i.e. a stellar wind ) , these outflows will be incapable of escaping the gravitational potential of the star due to the small ( @xmath50.5 ; ) fractions of the stellar escape velocity that the accretion flows attain during their infall .",
    "obviously this is an ideal scenario , but the energy budget argument holds if a large portion of the energy in the wind is provided by the accretion flow , which it seems to be in cttss . to summarize , the lower infall velocities relative to the stellar escape velocities in haebes may indicate that these accretion flows can not efficiently drive mass outflows from the stellar surface",
    ".    if magnetically controlled mass infall in haebes is incapable of driving outflows , another form of accretion may be partly responsible for driving the outflows from objects with large @xmath18 .",
    "we suggested in that boundary layer accretion in haebes could provide the necessary energy , although it is unclear exactly how the energy is tranferred to the outflow .",
    "one possible scenario discussed in for launching outflows from the boundary layer is the @xcite x  celerator mechanism .",
    "the high @xmath8sin@xmath9 values of haebes are ideal for producing this type of outflow .",
    "better @xmath18 estimates for a larger number of haebes will help elucidate the relationship between profile type and the role of the accreting material in producing the outflow signatures .",
    "@xcite examine the he i @xmath125876 in a sample of 31 cttss .",
    "they find an emission component ( broad , narrow , or both ) in all of the objects in their sample .",
    "they interpret the broad component emission as arising in a hot wind as well as in the accretion flow onto the star .",
    "the narrow emission component is interpreted as forming in the post  shock gas at the base of an accretion column at the surface of the star .",

    "none of these objects show the narrow component that is commonly seen in cttss , as well as wttss",

    "five show unambiguous evidence of mass outflow at he i @xmath1210830 , although these observations are not simultaneous to the he i @xmath125876 observations .",
    "due to the prevalence of blue  shifted absorption observed in the he i @xmath125876 emission objects , our data supports the suggestion by @xcite that the broad he i @xmath125876 emission component may partly arise in a hot wind near the star .",
    "we have presented a large sample census of mass flows around herbig ae / be stars using a wide variety of mass flow diagnostics and determined the fraction of objects that display unambiguous ( i.e. red and blue  shifted absorption ) mass flow signatures .",
    "we find that the na i d interstellar absorption line centers are good approximations , to within 8.1@xmath72 km s@xmath6 , to the center - of - mass radial velocity in most haebe systems , confirming the conclusion reached by @xcite .",
    "of the 78 haebes included in the final analysis , 26%@xmath40 show direct signs of mass infall and 37%@xmath41 show direct evidence of mass outflow .",
    "these percentages are very similar to those found in using the he i @xmath1210830 line .",
    "overall , the optical data reinforce the conclusions outlined in .",
    "more specifically , we find lower rates of both red and blue  shifted absorption for haebes than is observed for cttss , suggesting that , in general , the innermost environments of haebes are not simply scaled analogues of cttss . similar to the data ,",
    "the haebe optical lines show maximum red  shifted absorption velocities that are smaller fractions of the stellar escape velocities than is found for cttss .",
    "this adds support to the argument presented in concerning the smaller size of haebe magnetospheres compared to those of cttss .",
    "this has implications for the ability of haebe accretion flows to power strong winds : less energetic funnel flows provide less of the required energy for launching outflows .",
    "this is supported by the lack of simultaneous blue and red  shifted absorption signatures seen in both the optical sample and the sample from .",
    "this contrasts with cttss for which the accretion process is believed to be the main energy source for outflows .",
    "we also find a significant difference between the occurrence of red  shifted absorption in hae stars compared to hbe stars ; both groups appear to exhibit outflow signatures at a similar rate .",
    "this suggests that hbe stars accrete material from their disks differently than hae stars , perhaps through a boundary layer instead of along magnetic field lines .",
    "the prominence of blue  shifted absorption in accreting objects in both subgroups suggests that the outflows in haebes are accretion driven .",
    "however , the lack of simultaneous red and blue  shifted absorption in all but one haebe ( hd 163296 ) indicates that whatever geometry is producing the absorption signature is not capable of producing the opposite absorption signature . in other words ,",
    "boundary layer accretion , which should not produce red  shifted absorption , may be capable of driving strong outflows which results in observed blue  shifted absorption ; magnetically controlled accretion from a small magnetosphere produces red  shifted absorption but is perhaps not energetic enough to drive outflows from the stellar surface , resulting in the lack of simultaneous red  shifted absorption in these profiles . due to the observed statistics",

    "<S> we examine a broad range of mass flow diagnostics in a large sample of herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) using high resolution optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0 and he i 5876   lines show the highest incidence of p  cygni ( 30% ) and inverse p  cygni ( 14% ) morphologies , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fe ii 4924 line also shows a large incidence of p  cygni profiles ( 11% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find support for many of the conclusions reached in a study based on the analysis of the line in a large sample of haebes . </S>",
    "<S> namely , haebes exhibit smaller fractions of both blue  shifted absorption ( i.e. mass outflow ) and red  shifted absorption ( i.e. mass infall or accretion ) than their lower mass cousins , the classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the optical data supports the conclusion that haebes displaying red  shifted absorption , in general , show maximum red  shifted absorption velocities that are smaller fractions of their stellar escape velocities than is found for cttss . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that haebe accretion flows are originating deeper in the gravitational potentials of their stars than in ctts systems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a lack of inner disk wind signatures in the blue  shifted absorption objects ; only stellar wind signatures are clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> these findings , along with the lack of detected magnetic fields around haebes , support the idea that large magnetospheres are not prevalent around haebes and that accretion flows are instead mediated by significantly smaller magnetospheres with relatively smaller truncation radii ( e.g. 12 @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> red  shifted absorption is much more common around herbig ae stars than be stars , suggesting that herbig be stars may accrete via a boundary layer rather than along magnetic field lines . </S>"
