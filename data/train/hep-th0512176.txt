    "we also give the interpretation which makes it possible to extend the analysis to the case of the penner model . in section  [ sec : penner ] , we summarize some of the known facts related to the correspondence between the penner model and the @xmath0 noncritical string theory . in section  [ sec :",

    "the @xmath1 noncritical string theory can be described by the hermitian one - matrix model .",

    "however , the potential of the @xmath1 matrix model has some local minima other than this , or it is unbounded from below . to prevent the eigenvalues from distributing around these unwanted minima , or the unbounded region",

    "the contributions from the perturbative expansion are divergent series , and the instantons give corrections to this series .",

    "the eigenvalues can no longer regarded as real . to make the model well - defined",

    "we have extended the definition of the penner model , and defined the partition function as a multiple contour integral with respect to the @xmath2 eigenvalues .",
    "we have also found the suitable choice of the both ends of the contour that gives the effect of instantons corresponding to the nonperturbative effect of the @xmath0 noncritical string theory . in the case of the @xmath1 matrix model",

    ", the instanton is defined as an eigenvalue is located on the other cut along the contour than that corresponding to the perturbative series . in this way , we have generalized the calculation for the instantons to the penner model .",

    "for the self - dual radius of @xmath35 , we can not distinguish these effects that come from d - instantons and those from d - particles .",
