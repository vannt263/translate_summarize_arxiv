    "magnetic playback theory deals with time dependence since tapes and hard disk platters move with respect to head in contrast with our work that deals with static head description .",
    "we concentrate on the description of magnetostatic interactions in 3d simplifying them to 2d in order to fully understand the karlqvist approximation and its many aspects that lie at the roots of recording theory .",
    "this work can be taught as an application chapter in a general electromagnetism course at the graduate level or in an undergraduate class of partial differential equations since physicists might be interested in applying some mathematical methods to solve laplace and poisson equations or understanding issues surrounding the development of magnetic recording advances in hard disks and storage media .",

    "the poles are separated by a gap region and face a semi - infinite plane devoid of any magnetic charges .",

    "section 2 describes green s function theory in 3d and its application to 2d with the karlqvist approximation delivering the potential and field created by the recording head in the plane on the basis of a simplified boundary value problem ( bvp ) described above . in section 3 ,",
    "karlqvist solution is revised and compared to exact fourier methods meant to solve the exact bvp . in section 4 we use conformal mapping methods to retrieve the solution for a more realistic head accounting for edge condition at angular points and leading to exact results . finally section 5 bears conclusions and perspectives of the work .",
