    "stellar and gas dynamical studies in an ever - increasing number of galaxies have established that many  and perhaps all  luminous galaxies contain central supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) .",
    "following the discovery that the sbh masses , @xmath3 , correlate with various properties of the host galaxy  such as bulge luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , mass ( hring & rix 2004 ) , velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt  2000a ) , light concentration ( graham  2001 ) , and halo circular velocity ( ferrarese 2002 )  it has become widely accepted that sbh and galaxy formation are closely entwined .",
    "unfortunately , the physical mechanisms underlying this connection remain obscure ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; portegies zwart  2004 ; shapiro 2005 ) . despite intense observational effort ,",
    "only about 30 galaxies have secure sbh detections ( see the recent review of ferrarese & ford 2005 ) , the great majority of which are luminous galaxies with magnitudes in the range @xmath4 .",
    "it is unclear if fainter and less massive galaxies _ also _ contain sbhs and , if so , whether such objects would obey extrapolations of the sbh scaling relations defined by the bright galaxies",
    ". searches for sbhs in low - luminosity members of the local group have so far produced ambiguous results .",
    "there is no evidence for a sbh in either m33 ( merritt  2001 ; gebhardt  2001 ) or ngc 205 ( valluri  2003 ) , yet m32 does appear to contain a sbh with @xmath3 @xmath0 2.5@xmath5 ( verolme  2002 ) .",
    "although they have very different morphologies , m33 ( sc ii - iii ) and ngc 205 ( s0/e5pec ) share one noteworthy similarity : their centers are both marked by the presence of a compact stellar nucleus ( with half - light radius @xmath6 2 - 4  pc ) that is @xmath7  20 times brighter than a typical globular cluster ( e.g. , kormendy & mcclure 1993 ; butler & martinez - delgado 2005 ) .",
    "while ground - based surveys of the virgo and fornax clusters had shown @xmath7 25% of de galaxies to contain such nuclei ( e.g. binggeli , tammann & sandage 1985 ; ferguson 1989 ; binggeli & cameron 1991 ) , recent observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) have revealed them to be far more common .",
    "about 50 - 70% of late - type galaxies observed by _ hst _",
    "contain a distinct nuclear star cluster ( carollo , stiavelli & mack 1998 ; matthews et  al 1999 ; bker et  al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; balcells 2003 ) , while a recent _ hst _ survey of 100 galaxies in the virgo cluster has detected nuclei in a comparable fraction ( 6682% ) of early - type galaxies ( ct  2006 ; see also lotz  2004 ; graham & guzman 2003 ; grant  2005 ) .    in this _",
    ", we explore the connection between compact stellar nuclei , sbhs and their host galaxies by combining _ hst _ imaging for 100 early - type galaxies from the _ acs virgo cluster survey _ ( acsvcs ; ct  2004 ) with new ground - based long - slit spectra for the brightest 69 of these galaxies .",
    "we show that the mass of the central massive object ( cmo )  either a compact stellar nucleus or a sbh  scales in direct proportion to the galaxy mass .",
    "this finding points to a direct link between sbhs , which are preferentially detected in the brightest galaxies , and the compact stellar nuclei commonly observed in galaxies of low and intermediate luminosity .",
    "_ hst _ images for 100 members of the virgo cluster were acquired with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( _ acs _ ; ford  1998 ) as part of the acsvcs ( go-9401 ) .",
    "the program galaxies span a range of @xmath0 460 in blue luminosity and have early - type morphologies : e , s0 , de , de , n or ds0 .",
    "images were taken in wfc mode with a filter combination roughly equivalent to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands in the sdss photometric system .",
    "the images cover a @xmath0 200@xmath10 field with @xmath11 resolution and 005 pixel@xmath12 sampling . for each galaxy ,",
    "azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles were determined as described by ferrarese  ( 2006 ) and ct  ( 2006 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for full details of the analysis .",
    "the 11 acsvcs galaxies brighter than @xmath13 mag are found to have surface brightness profiles that are accurately represented by a  core - srsic \" model ( graham  2003 ; trujillo  2004 ) , described by a srsic ( 1968 ) model outside a  break radius \" , @xmath14 , of a few arcseconds , and a shallower power - law interior to @xmath14 .",
    "none of these bright galaxies shows clear evidence for a central stellar luminosity excess over the fitted profile .",
    "in contrast , nearly all of the fainter galaxies are well fitted with pure srsic models ; in addition , 6080% of these 89 galaxies show evidence for a nucleus , identified as a luminosity excess over the best fitted profile within @xmath7  1 . in 51 galaxies , the nucleus is conspicuous enough to allow us to measure photometric and structural parameters ; we do so by adding a king model ( king 1966 ) to the srsic component when fitting the surface brightness profile .",
    "[ fig : sbp ] shows images and surface brightness profiles for two representative galaxies from the acsvcs : a  core - srsic \" galaxy with @xmath15 mag ( m60 ) , which also happens to have a dynamically measured sbh mass @xmath16 = 2.0(@xmath17)@xmath18 ( gebhardt 2003 ) ; and a typical nucleated srsic galaxy ( ic 3773 ) with @xmath19 mag .    although compact , the central nuclei are resolved in all but a half dozen or so cases : half - light radii range from @xmath20 pc ( i.e. , unresolved ) to 62 pc , with a median of @xmath0 4  pc .",
    "we estimate total masses for the nuclei by multiplying their @xmath21 luminosities ( determined by integrating the best - fit king models ) with appropriate mass - to - light ratios , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "single - burst stellar population models from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) were used to estimate @xmath22 and @xmath23 for each nucleus , at the metallicity appropriate for the observed color , for a fixed assumed age of @xmath24 = 5  gyr and adopting a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "the uncertain ages of the nuclei is the dominant source of uncertainty on the derived masses ; the difference ( of order @xmath2545% ) between the 5  gyr masses and those obtained assuming ages of 2 and 10  gyr , is taken as representative of the error on the quoted values .",
    "long - slit spectra for the 69 acsvcs galaxies brighter than @xmath26 mag , of which 29 are classified as certainly nucleated , were obtained between 2003 march 1012 and 2003 march 2128 using facilities at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "all spectra were obtained with the slit oriented along the galaxy photometric major axis , and were centered on the mg b triplet near  5200   .",
    "three separate instrumental setups were used for th<e bright , middle and faint thirds of the sample .",
    "spectral resolutions ranged between 94   and 220  at 5200   .",
    "exposure times ranged between 2400 s and 5400 s. between one and three giant or subgiant stars of spectral type g8k2 , to be used as velocity dispersion templates , were observed each night with the same instrumental setup adopted for the galaxies .",
    "systemic velocities , @xmath27 , and velocity dispersions , @xmath28 , were extracted using the penalized pixel - fitting code of cappellari & emsellem ( 2004 ) from spectra binned , in the spatial direction , within an aperture of radius equal to the galaxy effective radius , @xmath29 .",
    "the final @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and their errors , are the averages and standard deviation of the values obtained using three different template stars .",
    "in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : ms ] masses for the nuclei are shown in red , plotted as a function of the extinction - corrected , absolute blue magnitude of the galaxy @xmath30 ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) . in the middle panel , masses are plotted against the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath28 , measured within @xmath29 .",
    "solid black dots show sbh masses ( from table  ii of ferrarese & ford 2005 ; @xmath30 values are mostly from the rc3 , de vaucouleurs et al .  1991 ) detected based on stellar / gas dynamical studies which resolve the sphere of influence .",
    "velocity dispersions for the galaxies with sbhs are from tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) or ( for the three galaxies for which no values were published in tremaine et al . )",
    "ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) .",
    "a first noteworthy point is that there is almost no overlap in the range of @xmath30 and @xmath28 occupied by galaxies with nuclei and sbhs , with the former found preferentially in fainter galaxies with lower velocity dispersion .",
    "this is partly , but not entirely , due to observational biases .",
    "galaxies brighter than @xmath31 mag do not contain nuclei ( see  [ sec : data ] ) but host sbhs .",
    "evidence supporting the latter statement comes from the fact that sbhs have been successfully detected in all galaxies targeted in this magnitude range by dynamical studies , and masses have been found to be consistent with the  relation .",
    "furthermore , the existence of sbhs in all bright galaxies is required to reconcile the local and agn sbh mass functions ( e.g. marconi  2004 ; shankar  2004 ) .    as one moves to fainter galaxies ,",
    "nuclei become increasingly common , and are almost always present in galaxies fainter than @xmath32 mag ( ct et al .",
    "located at the faint end of the magnitude range spanned by the acsvcs galaxies , ngc 205 and m33 , both of which are strongly nucleated , are not believed to contain sbhs ( merritt  2001 ; gebhardt  2001 ; valluri 2003 ) .",
    "galaxies with nuclei , sbhs or , possibly , both , are found in the @xmath33 mag range . in the same magnitude range , galaxies exist for which the existence of a sbh is uncertain ( e.g. ngc 3379 , ngc 4342 , gebhardt  2000b ; cretton and van den bosch 1999 ) .",
    "overall , therefore , the existing data supports a view in which _ bright galaxies often , and perhaps always , contain sbhs but not stellar nuclei . as one moves to fainter galaxies ,",
    "nuclei become the dominant feature while sbhs might become less common , and perhaps disappear entirely at the faint end .",
    "_    further insight can be gained by relating the masses of nuclei and sbhs to the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "regression fits ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) for the early - type galaxies ( spirals have been excluded to ensure consistency with the acsvcs sample ) confirm the visual impression from the left and middle panels of fig  [ fig : ms ] that nuclei and sbhs obey statistically different scaling relations with respect to both galaxy magnitude and bulge velocity dispersion ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , a different picture emerges ( see the right panel of fig  [ fig : ms ] ) when the virial mass of the host galaxy , @xmath34 is considered . here",
    "@xmath35 is the gravitational constant and @xmath36 ( cappellari et al.2006 ) ; the geometric effective radius , @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the radius measured along the isophotal semi - major axis , is taken from ferrarese  ( 2006 ) for the acsvcs galaxies , and from marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) for the galaxies hosting sbhs .",
    "a regression analysis ( table  1 ) demonstrates that _ the nuclei and sbhs obey a common scaling relation linking their mass to the virial mass of the host galaxy_. furthermore , the same relation is obeyed by the nuclei of ngc 205 ( geha  2006 ) and m33 ( for which we adopt @xmath39 kpc , intermediate to the values of minniti et al .",
    "1994 and regan & vogel 1994 ) , while the upper limits on the mass of the central sbh in both galaxies fall well below the best fit line .    on these grounds",
    ", we suggest that sbhs and nuclei should be grouped together under the terminology , `` central massive object '' ( cmo ) , which we adopt for the remainder of this _ letter_. constraining the slope of the  relation to be unity leads to a constant ratio between cmo and galaxy mass @xmath40 ( with a @xmath41 range of 0.060.52% ) , a conclusion also reached , based on photometric data only , by ct et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and wehner & harris ( 2006 ) .",
    "we note that our conclusions are insensitive to the exact methodology used in measuring @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , integrating @xmath28 within 1  ( a region dominated by the nucleus ) , between 3  and @xmath29 ( a region dominated by the host galaxy ) , or within 1/8@xmath29 ( as in ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , changes the individual measurements ( by , on average @xmath75% , although differences of up to 30% can be seen for some of the fainter galaxies ) but does not alter the overall trend .",

    "this suggests that a single mechanism is responsible for the growth  and perhaps the formation  of both nuclei and sbhs .",
    "it also points to galaxy mass as the primary ( though not necessarily only ) parameter regulating such growth .",
    "stellar cusps and sbhs have often been linked in the literature , and it is therefore natural to ask whether nuclei could be the by - product of sbh evolution . since most nuclei in the acsvcs galaxies are spatially resolved , we can exclude that they formed either via adiabatic growth ( young 1980 ) or , in the fainter galaxies , via the bahcall - wolf ( 1976 ) process , since either mechanism generates a power - law cusp only within a fraction of the sbh s influence radius ( merritt & szell 2005 ) .",
    "however , nuclei and sbhs might coexist in _ some _ galaxies ; the most promising cases being m32 ( verolme et al .",
    "2002 ) and the milky way ( ghez et al . 2003 ; schdel et al .",
    "although neither galaxy possesses the kind of nucleus seen in the faintest acsvcs galaxies , it is quite possible , if not likely , for nuclei to undergo structural changes as a consequence of the presence of the central sbh .    beyond this ,",
    "the exact interplay between nuclei and sbhs remains elusive .",
    "it is possible that nuclei form in all galaxies , but in the most massive systems either they subsequently collapse to sbhs , or are destroyed or modified by the evolution of pre - existing sbhs . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , the surface brightness profiles of galaxies brighter than @xmath31 mag , which host sbhs but not nuclei , display an inner `` deficit '' relative to the inward extrapolation of the srsic law that best fits the outer parts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sbp ] ; ferrarese  2006 ; trujillo  2004 ) .",
    "such deficits are generally believed to result from the disruptive effects of binary sbh evolution ( ebisuzaki , makino & okumura 1991 ; milosavljevi  2002 ; ravinandrath  2002 ; graham 2004 ) , so the same process might have led to the destruction of a central nucleus .",
    "nuclei in slightly fainter galaxies which also contain a sbh might have avoided destruction or might have been regenerated at a later time , perhaps , e.g. , by subsequent star formation . determining stellar population ages for",
    "the nuclei would provide some observational constraints for this scenario .",
    "age and abundance measurements for our nuclei will be presented in a future acsvcs paper .",
    "alternatively , the formation of sbhs and nuclei could be mutually exclusive , with only material collected at the centers of massive systems able to collapse to a black hole , while in less massive galaxies the collapse is halted and a star cluster is formed .",
    "sbhs and nuclei are almost certainly mutually exclusive in the faintest galaxies considered here , as suggested by the fact that , although the nuclear masses of ngc 205 and m33 are fully consistent with the  relation , the upper limits on their sbh masses are _ not _ , implying that neither galaxy contains a sbh of the sort expected from extrapolations of the scaling relations defined by sbhs in massive galaxies . if the formation of a sbh prevents the formation of a `` ngc 205-type '' nucleus ( or vice versa ) , then nuclei of galaxies which are known to host sbhs ( e.g. , m32 , the mw , and potentially all galaxies with a few @xmath54  @xmath55 a few@xmath56  ) would necessarily have to belong to a separate class . a high resolution study of the nuclear morphology in nearby ( @xmath57 mpc ) galaxies might unveil whether nuclei in galaxies of different mass are structurally distinct .",
    "these issues will be explored in more detail in forthcoming papers .",
