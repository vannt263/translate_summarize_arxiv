    "the atlas collaboration has recently observed a localised excess in the invariant mass distribution of pairs of fat jets , hereafter denoted by @xmath1 , around @xmath2 tev  @xcite .",
    "fat jets can be produced in the hadronic decay of boosted bosons @xmath3 , where the two quarks from the boson decay merge into a single jet . using jet substructure analyses ,",
    "the fat jets are tagged as resulting from a boson decay .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite the jets are identified as @xmath4 or @xmath5 bosons if the jet mass @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 gev or @xmath8 gev , respectively .",
    "the excess in the @xmath9 spectrum appears for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 selections , with statistical significances of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "can be simultaneously tagged as @xmath4 and @xmath5 with these criteria , as the mass windows for @xmath4 and @xmath5 tagging partially overlap .",
    "this indicates , in particular , that a @xmath10 signal can yield significant excesses in the @xmath12 and @xmath11 selections too . ]",
    "these three channels are not independent and some events fall into two or even the three above categories .",
    "a statistical combination of the three channels must take this fact into account , and has not been yet performed .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons are known to decay leptonically , therefore a potential diboson resonance should also show up in ( semi-)leptonic channels .",
    "but it does not .",
    "for example , for spin-1 @xmath10 resonances with a mass @xmath16 tev the atlas collaboration has the following 95% confidence level ( cl ) upper limits on the cross section @xmath17 :    * @xmath18 channel  @xcite : @xmath19 fb , with an expected limit of 12 fb .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath13 excess . as mentioned above , this search is also sensitive to @xmath12 and @xmath11 resonances . * @xmath20 channel , @xmath21  @xcite : @xmath22 fb ( 11 fb expected ) .",
    "this search is also sensitive to @xmath12 resonances .",
    "* @xmath23 channel  @xcite : @xmath24 fb ( 16 fb expected ) .",
    "this search is also sensitive to @xmath11 resonances .",
    "* @xmath25 channel  @xcite : @xmath26 fb ( 24 fb expected ) .",
    "therefore , the absence of any signal in the semi - leptonic channels excludes a significant excess in the fully hadronic one .",
    "in particular , the @xmath27 channel has better sensitivity than the @xmath28 one  the expected limit is smaller  but deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions are not found .",
    "( we note in passing that the `` definition '' of the fat jet @xmath1 is the same in the three atlas analyses  @xcite . )",
    "the tension between the atlas @xmath28 and @xmath27 searches can be quantified with a simple event counting . with the @xmath10 selection , there are 15 observed events in the hadronic channel with @xmath29 $ ] tev , for an expected background of approximately 7 events . with the colected luminosity of 20.3 fb@xmath30 , these eight extra events require a signal cross section @xmath31}$ ] times branching ratio and efficiency factors of @xmath32 }",
    "\\times \\text{br}(w \\to q \\bar q ' ) \\times \\text{br}(z \\to q \\bar q ) \\times \\text{eff } = 0.39 ~\\text{fb}\\,.\\ ] ] the superscript in @xmath31}$ ] emphasises that this is the cross section for @xmath29 $ ] tev alone .",
    "( because the reconstructed invariant mass distribution of a 2 tev resonance is wider than the invariant mass interval considered , the actual @xmath10 cross section @xmath33 required to reproduce the excess is around twice larger . ) for the selection efficiency of 0.14 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which does not include the hadronic branching ratios , we find @xmath31 } = 6 $ ] fb .",
    "now let us reverse the procedure to estimate the number of extra events that should show up in the @xmath27 channel . with the efficiency of 0.25 for @xmath34 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath35 includes electrons , muons and taus , @xmath31 } = 6 $ ] fb would yield 7 extra events in the mass interval @xmath36 $ ] tev , which practically coincides with the interval considered for the hadronic channel .",
    "but there are six observed events in this mass interval , for an expected background around 6.5 events",
    ". this would amount to a @xmath37 underfluctuation of the signal observed in the @xmath28 channel .",
    "the cms collaboration has also looked for spin-1 @xmath10 resonances in the @xmath28 channel  @xcite , using a slightly different strategy . for a resonance mass @xmath16 tev ,",
    "the limit is @xmath38 fb , with an expected limit of 8 fb .",
    "although there is some excess around @xmath39 tev , the cms upper limit on the cross section is also in tension with the interpretation of the atlas excess as a narrow @xmath10 resonance .",
    "the cms analysis of the semi - leptonic channel  @xcite does not observe any excess at @xmath39 tev .",
    "mode a @xmath40 deviation is found at invariant masses around 1.8 tev , though limits are not reported for spin-1 particles .",
    "for a 1.8 tev spin-2 graviton the limits are @xmath41 fb , with 7 fb expected , but these numbers can not be directly compared to the atlas limits  @xcite because of the different signal efficiencies . ] the cms search in the fully leptonic channel  @xcite gives an upper limit @xmath42 fb for @xmath39 tev .",
    "more generally , a mixture of spin - one @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances with nearly the same mass ( they can appear for example in models with a heavy @xmath43 vector boson triplet  @xcite ) can not explain the @xmath28 excess .",
    "this can be shown with a simple exercise . since the jet mass cuts in the atlas semi - leptonic searches , @xmath44  @xcite and @xmath45  @xcite , are wide enough to accept @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons",
    ", one can approximately rewrite the corresponding 95% cl cross section limits in ( ii ) and ( iii ) as @xmath46 by rescaling with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 hadronic branching ratios and ignoring small efficiency differences that may arise from the different @xmath4 and @xmath5 boson masses .",
    "for the fully hadronic final state , a relative acceptance factor @xmath47 for @xmath12 and @xmath11 diboson signals with the @xmath10 selection can be roughly estimated from the overlap of the jet mass distribution for signal samples in ref .",
    "@xcite . the total @xmath28 signal @xmath48 with the @xmath10 selection",
    "can then be estimated as @xmath49 and reaches a maximum @xmath50 fb given the constraints in eqs .",
    "( [ ec : reint ] ) .",
    "besides , the cms search in the @xmath28 channel with a wide mass window @xmath51 gev does not observe such a large excess , as mentioned above .",
    "one can also wonder if a different type of resonance ( _ e.g. _ with spin 2 ) yielding different diboson helicity configurations may have an efficiency in the semi - leptonic channels much smaller than for a vector resonance which mainly produces longitudinal vector bosons therefore turning the non - observation of a large signal compatible with the @xmath28 excess . as it will be shown , this is not the case because the event selection criteria used by the atlas and cms collaborations mainly focus on the kinematics of the reconstructed bosons rather than on its leptonic decay products .",
    "the possibility that the atlas @xmath28 anomaly is due to higgs production incorrectly tagged as @xmath52 is strongly disfavoured by other measurements :    * an atlas search for @xmath53 resonances  @xcite gives @xmath54 fb for @xmath39 tev , with an expected limit around 45 fb .",
    "* a search for @xmath55 and @xmath0 resonances in the fully hadronic @xmath28 channel by the cms collaboration  @xcite yields cross section limits @xmath56 fb and @xmath57 fb , very close to the expected ones . a preliminary @xmath0 resonance search in the @xmath27 final state  @xcite",
    "yields a @xmath58 excess at @xmath59 tev , with @xmath60 fb for an expected limit of 20 fb .",
    "but the hypothesis of a @xmath0 resonance behind the latter excess is disfavoured by the former search , which gives @xmath61 fb for @xmath62 tev . a similar analysis by the atlas collaboration  @xcite is less sensitive , giving @xmath63 fb , @xmath64 fb , for a resonance mass @xmath65 tev .",
    "since neither @xmath53 nor @xmath66 resonance signals show up in these dedicated searches , it is very unlikely that they could contribute significantly to the @xmath28 excess with a fat dijet selection optimised for @xmath67 production .",
    "additionally , one expects relations between @xmath67 and @xmath66 decay fractions of heavy resonances in definite models  @xcite .",
    "all this overwhelming set of related sm - like measurements has motivated the caution by the atlas collaboration regarding this excess , but it has not discouraged early interpretations as new diboson resonances of technicolour models  @xcite . while ref .",
    "@xcite only takes into account the limit on the production of @xmath10 resonances from the fully leptonic channel ( the weakest one ) , ref .",
    "@xcite attributes the tension among the searches in different @xmath68 decay channels to statistics .",
    "other @xmath69 interpretations  @xcite only focus on the @xmath28 excess overlooking the null results obtained in the other decay modes of the gauge boson pair .",
    "statistical fluctuations aside , experimental data seem to disfavour the possibility that the atlas @xmath28 excess results from a diboson resonance .",
    "we are then led to consider that , it this excess is real , it might be due to something different that looks as a diboson peak due to the kinematical selection applied to reduce sm backgrounds . as we will show in this paper , a requirement on transverse momenta applied in ref .",
    "@xcite shapes certain resonant @xmath70 signals , with @xmath71 an extra particle , making them look like a @xmath67 resonance .",
    "such a requirement is not used by the corresponding analysis of the @xmath28 final state by the cms collaboration  @xcite , nor in the atlas analyses of semi - leptonic final states . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we explore several final state topologies to find in which cases a diboson peak is kinematically produced  without an actual diboson resonance . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we show in two benchmark examples how a possible signal would look like with the atlas and cms fat dijet selections , as well as in the atlas analyses of semi - leptonic final states .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sec:4 ] . in an appendix",
    "we discuss to what extent the event selection efficiencies in the semi - leptonic channels depend on the different diboson helicities .",
    "in this section we explore different topologies in which a diboson pair plus an extra particle @xmath71 are produced , focusing for definiteness on @xmath10 production .",
    "( results are the same for @xmath12 and @xmath11 , obviously . ) in principle , the @xmath71 particle could either be invisible ( thus a potential dark matter candidate ) , or a new relatively light scalar with dominant hadronic decay , or even just a sm gauge or higgs boson .",
    "we work at the partonic level , calculating matrix elements for processes with new generic scalars , fermions or vector bosons , integrating over phase space and parton distribution functions , and examining how the @xmath67 invariant mass distribution is shaped by the following cuts applied in the atlas dijet analysis  @xcite :    1 .",
    "boson pseudo - rapidity @xmath72 and rapidity difference @xmath73 , where the indices 1 and 2 denote the two bosons .",
    "at least one of the two bosons must have transverse momentum @xmath74 greater than 360 gev .",
    "transverse momentum asymmetry @xmath75 . together with the rapidity difference cut",
    ", this requirement selects approximately back - to - back bosons even if they are not produced from the decay of an @xmath76-channel resonance .    in this section",
    "we do not impose the requirement on missing energy @xmath77 gev of the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite to remain as general as possible , since in principle @xmath71 could be invisible or decay hadronically . at any rate , the application of such a cut does not significantly modify the obtained distributions .",
    "matrix elements are evaluated using helas  @xcite including the decay of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons .",
    "phase space integration is done by implementing these processes into the generator protos  @xcite .",
    "we give our results for specific choices of the new particles , _",
    "e.g. _ assuming that @xmath71 is a neutral scalar .",
    "but our results are more general , as they are mainly based on the kinematics of cascade decays , and we have explicitly checked this fact by using `` flat '' matrix elements , constant except for the resonant propagators , which make no assumption on the spin or charge of the new particles .",
    "results are also independent of the incoming partons . for definiteness",
    "we assume @xmath78 , @xmath79 initial states for the production of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "however , the presence of the extra particle @xmath71 opens the possibility of gluon - initiated processes with larger partonic luminosities .",
    "it is clear from the beginning that non - resonant diboson production , with or without an extra particle , can not give a peak at an invariant mass as high as 2 tev merely with the application of the kinematical cuts in ( 13 ) .",
    "however , it is interesting to consider this academic case to investigate how an unaccounted sm contribution could be affected by this event selection .",
    "we consider @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( with @xmath71 a neutral scalar ) plus the charge conjugate processes , mediated by a @xmath84-channel heavy quark @xmath85 , as shown in figure  [ fig : topvv ] .",
    "the normalised @xmath10 invariant mass distributions before and after cuts are presented in figure  [ fig : distvv ] ( top ) . for @xmath86",
    "we take a scalar mass @xmath87 gev , but the results are rather independent of this value . the cuts",
    "reduce the cross section by a factor of 5 for @xmath10 and 11 for @xmath86 and in both cases they maintain the shape of the distribution , with a shift towards larger invariant masses and a long tail .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for @xmath88 and the atlas @xmath89 selection criteria . in this case",
    "the efficiency variations are rather small , as it is expected from the distributions in figure  [ fig : ang ] .",
    "the largest difference is found for @xmath90 with an efficiency a factor of @xmath91 larger than for the @xmath92 helicities .",
    "the same conclusions apply for @xmath10 resonances in the @xmath89 channel .",
