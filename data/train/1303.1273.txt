    "it is now widely believed that _ all _ massive elliptical galaxies , and massive bulges in disk galaxies , house a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their center ( magorrian et al .  1998 ; richstone et al .  1998 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ) . in the standard cosmological formation paradigm of the universe ,",
    "galaxies grow hierarchically , such that smaller systems merge to build larger ones ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; khochfar & burkert 2001 ) . as galaxies containing smbhs collide , their black holes will migrate to the center of the merger remnant through dynamical friction , and form a bound binary . the subsequent hardening of the black hole binary , following the dissipation of orbital energy and angular momentum to the nearby stars , impacts on the central stellar distribution of the newly merged galaxy .",
    "the gravitational slingshot ejection of these stars ( from the binary s loss cone ) via three - body interactions involving the binary is thought to be responsible for the physical origin of the partially depleted nuclear regions in luminous `` core - srsic '' galaxies which experienced ` dry ' , i.e. gas poor , merger events ( begelman et al .",
    "1980 ; ebisuzaki et al .  1991",
    "; faber et al .  1997 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; merritt 2006 ; sesana 2010 ; gualandris & merritt 2012 ) .",
    "given the above scenario , the sizes and mass deficits of partially depleted cores are thought to reflect the amount of galactic merging and the ensuing extent of damage caused by binary smbhs ( after having eroded any preexisting nuclear star clusters : bekki & graham 2010 ) .",
    "accurate measurements of the central stellar mass deficits in `` core - srsic '' galaxies can therefore provide useful constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a key concept is that such core formation is by and large a cumulative process in which the ejected mass from smbh binaries scales both with the final smbh mass and the number of mergers ( e.g. ,  milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; merritt 2006 ) .",
    "some recent studies have additionally postulated enhanced core depletions as a result of recursive core passages of recoiled smbhs ( gualandris & merritt 2008 ) , or due to the actions of multiple smbhs from merging galaxies ( kulkarni & loeb 2011 ) .    to date , several quantitative studies of the central stellar mass deficit have focused on elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , graham 2004 ; trujillo et al .  2004 ; merritt 2006 ; kormendy & bender 2009 ; dullo & graham 2012 ) .",
    "violent , major dry merger events are commonly , or at least traditionally , thought to produce these elliptical galaxies ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; barnes & herquist 1992 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , as noted above , dry merger events involving supermassive black holes are also typically thought to be responsible for producing elliptical galaxies with partially depleted cores",
    ". therefore , some ambiguity exists regarding the mechanisms for the formation of the lenticular ( s0 ) disk galaxies having depleted cores .    in 1936",
    "hubble introduced lenticular galaxies into the tuning fork diagram ( jeans 1928 ; hubble 1929 ) ; they were added as a hypothetical transition type between elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "later observation of the populations of lenticular and spiral galaxies in clusters revealed the dominance of lenticular galaxies ( spiral galaxies ) in local ( in distant ) clusters ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; couch et al .",
    "1998 ; fasano et al .",
    "2000 ; desai et al .  2007 ;",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "2009 ; silchenko et al .",
    "this suggested an evolutionary transformation of s0 galaxies from spiral galaxies , where mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ; quilis et al .",
    "2000 ) , galaxy - galaxy harassment ( moore et al .  1996 ) , strangulation ( larson et al .  1980 ; bekki et al .  2002 ;",
    "kawata & mulchaey 2008 ) and gas starvation by agn ( van den bergh 2009 ) were forwarded to account for the removal of disk gas and the subsequent quenching of star formation , thereby passively fading the spiral galaxies and erasing their spiral arms .",
    "these formation scenarios , however , do not in themselves explain the central stellar depletions observed in some s0 galaxies .",
    "the theoretical work of steinmetz & navarro ( 2002 ) has suggested that a galaxy s morphology is a transient phenomenon . in this hierarchical picture ,",
    "classic elliptical galaxies are built through major mergers ( of disk galaxies ) and may progressively regrow stellar disks , by gas accretion , which remain intact only until the next significant merger ( see okamoto & nagashima 2001 ; governato et al .",
    "2009 ; pichon et al .",
    "2011 ; sales et al .  2011",
    "; conselice et al .",
    "2012 for supporting arguments )",
    ". the number of such cycles may however be low ( i.e.  1 ) rather than several ( 3 to 5 ) .",
    "likewise , arnold et al . ( 2011 ) and forbes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) recently pointed out that s0s might form through a two - phase inside - out assembly with the inner regions built early via a violent major merger , and `` wet '' minor mergers subsequently contributing to the outer parts .",
    "this assembly scenario is consistent with the observed presence of partially depleted cores in luminous s0 galaxies .",
    "it also suggests that their bulges , most of which we know are old ( e.g. , macarthur , gonzlez & courteau 2009 , and references therein ) , were already around at @xmath9 to 2 .",
    "graham ( 2013 , his fig .",
    "1 ) revealed that the compact galaxies at @xmath10 to 2 have masses and structural properties consistent with those of the brighter bulges in local disk galaxies .",
    "rather than being the precursors of elliptical galaxies prior to significant size evolution , graham ( 2013 ) advocated that some of these compact high-@xmath11 galaxies may therefore be associated with the bulges of modern disk galaxies .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario in which compact _ galaxies _ evolve into disk galaxies with compact bulges , the ( high velocity)-end of the galaxy ` velocity dispersion function ' would not be expected to evolve from @xmath7 to 0 , just as observed ( bezanson , van dokkum & franx 2012 ) .    regarding the analysis of surface brightness profiles , trujillo et al.(2004 ) avoided the inclusion of s0 galaxies in their sample of well - resolved local galaxies because it was felt that the introduction of an 8-parameter model ( 5 or 6 core - srsic parameters for the bulge plus 2 for the exponential disk ) might be considered excessive at that time .",
    "ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also avoided introducing two additional disk parameters in their modelling of well - resolved early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster ; however because their sample included disk galaxies , their core - srsic parameters do not correspond to the bulge component .",
    "although kormendy et al .  ( 2009 ) did fit a srsic bulge plus an exponential disk to their s0 galaxies , they marked the core region by eye rather than objectively fitting a core - srsic bulge plus exponential disk model .",
    "depending on the sharpness of the ( inner core)-to-(outer srsic ) transition region , this practice may substantially over - estimate the formal ` break radius '  which is not to be confused with the inner or outer edge of the transition region .    here",
    "we endeavor to provide the most accurate measurements to date of the centrally depleted stellar mass in lenticular disk galaxies .",
    "this is achieved by simultaneously fitting both a core - srsic model to the bulge _ and _ an exponential model to the disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our initial sample of six suspected lenticular galaxies with depleted cores , plus the data reduction , and the light profile extraction technique are discussed in section [ data2 ] . in dullo & graham ( 2012 )",
    "we did not have a sufficient radial extent of these six galaxies light profiles to include a disk component .",
    "here we are able to test if this may have slightly biased some of our previous measurements of the bulge parameters .",
    "section [ modl ] introduces the analytical models used to describe the light profiles of `` core - srsic '' lenticular galaxies , and section [ fita ] details our fitting analysis while in section [ cedef ] we describe the method for measuring the mass deficits of the core - srsic lenticular galaxies .",

    "finally , the images were masked to avoid the gaps between individual ccd detectors , the partially missing quadrant of the wfpc2 images , and regions including bright foreground stars , background galaxies , chip defects and galaxy dust lanes .",
    "the galaxy light profiles were extracted using the iraf / stsdas task ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) .",

    "disky isophotes are frequently due to the presence of embedded disks in less massive , fast rotating , dissipative ( gas rich ) galaxies ( e.g. , carter 1978 , 1987 ; davies et al .  1983 ; bender et al .  1988 ; peletier et al .",

    "( 2012 ) describe in detail the stripping process of a galaxy in abell 3558 .",
    "the merger event in ngc 4382 s past may have occurred prior to it entering the cluster .",
    "coupling n - body simulations with a semi - analytic formation model , okamoto & nagashima ( 2001 ) also reported that the fractions of cluster s0 galaxies produced by major mergers are significantly smaller than the observed fractions .",
    "in contrast , bekki ( 1998 ) proposed unequal galaxy merging between two spirals as a dominant formation origin for cluster lenticular galaxies ( see also burkert & naab 2005 and jesseit et al .",
    "ngc 4382 is situated in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , a location where mergers are likely to occur , and it displays stellar shells in its image ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "these appear to suggest that ngc 4382 might have a merger related origin ( although see chung et al .",
    "the @xmath162 bulge colour of ngc 4382 ( fig .",
    "[ figg5 ] ) is however bluer than the typical @xmath163 ( ab mag ) colour quoted for ellipticals ( fukugita et al .",
    "if the core in ngc 4382 was formed from the inspiral of supermassive black holes in a relatively gas - free merger event , then the progenitor stars which make the bulge were not old , suggestive of ongoing core formation in some lenticular galaxies rather than all being formed at redshifts beyond 1.5 to 2 prior to the subsequent accretion of a disk .",
    "we have used the iraf ellipse task to derive the major - axis surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters for six early - type galaxies observed with the high - resolution _ hst _ wfpc2 and acs cameras .",
    "while one of these turned out to be an elliptical galaxy , which we modelled with a core - srsic profile , we have modeled the surface brightness profiles of the remaining five lenticular galaxies using a core - srsic model for the bulge plus an exponential model for the disk .",
    "this is the first time this has been done for disk galaxies with depleted cores . in our analysis , we have additionally accounted for the bar component in one of these disk galaxies by using the ferrers ( 1877 ) function .",
    "our primary conclusions are as follows : + 1 .",
    "the core - srsic bulge plus exponential disk model gives an accurate description to core - srsic lenticular galaxy light profiles .",
    "the rms residual scatter of the fits are @xmath105 mag arcsec@xmath47 .",
    "the srsic index @xmath42 is @xmath164 for the bulges of our core - srsic lenticular galaxies , whereas @xmath165 for the brighter core - srsic elliptical galaxies in dullo & graham ( 2012 ) .",
    "\\3 . the core ` break radii ' range from 24 to 102 pc .",
    "we have measured central stellar mass deficits in four of the luminous `` core - srsic ''",
    "lenticular galaxies , finding @xmath166 @xmath2 , in agreement with previous core - srsic analysis of elliptical galaxies .",
    "( ngc 3607 was excluded because its dusty nuclear spiral compromises the recovery of its core parameters . )",
    "our results tentatively suggest that , regardless of their environments , core - srsic lenticular galaxies could be assembled in two stages : an earlier violent ` dry ' major merger process involving massive black holes , which forms the bulge component , followed by subsequent disk formation through minor mergers and/or very gentle cold gas accretion about a preferred plane .",
    "dry intermediate - mass ratio mergers of s0s with smaller bh - hosting ellipticals could also account for the buildup of some core - srsic s0s .",
    "the location of the bulges of our five s0 galaxies , including the s0 ngc 3607 possibly with out a depleted core , in the mass - size and mass-(srsic index ) diagram coincides with that of the compact early - type galaxies seen at redshift of @xmath155 0.2 to 2.7 .",
    "this could be an indication that today s massive bulges may be descendants of the compact high redshift early - type galaxies .",
    "this research was supported under the australian research council s funding scheme ( dp110103509 and ft110100263 ) .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
