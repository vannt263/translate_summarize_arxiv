    "luminous high - redshift ly@xmath1 nebulae promise to yield significant insights into the physics of massive galaxy formation ( e.g. , mori & umemura et al .",

    ", they provide an efficient way to select distant galaxies expected to be undergoing phases of significant mass - assembly ( e.g. steidel et al . 2000 ) .    what powers the ly@xmath1 emission from these nebulae ?",
    "this question is fundamental to our understanding of the nature and evolutionary status of these enigmatic objects and their central galaxies .",
    "a number of ideas have been discussed in the literature , the most promising of which are : ( i ) cooling radiation emitted during the infall of gas into the dark matter halos of massive proto - galaxies ( e.g. haiman , spanns & quataert 2000 ) ; ( ii ) mechanical energy injected by supernovae during powerful starbursts ( e.g. taniguchi & shioya 2000 ) ; ( iii ) scattering of ly@xmath1 photons by neutral hydrogen halos around massive , ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies ( e.g. villar - martn et al .",
    "1996 ; zheng et al .",
    "2011 ) ; or ( iv ) photoionization by luminous active galactic nuclei and/or young stars ( agns ; e.g. villar - martn et al . 2003 ; prescott et al .",
    "2012 ) . while there is currently no consensus concerning which powering mechanism is dominant , it is now clear that no single mechanism is able to explain all ly@xmath1 nebulae ( e.g. smith & jarvis 2007 ; prescott et al . 2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "scattering of ly@xmath1 photons by neutral hydrogen can result in a net observed polarization in the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "polarimetry is thus a promising way to distinguish between scattering and _ in situ _ production of the ly@xmath1 photons ( e.g. dijkstra & loeb 2008 ) . due to the challenges and observational expense involved , polarization measurements of spatially extended ly@xmath1 emission had been , until now , attempted for only two ly@xmath1 nebulae .",
    "prescott et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented imaging polarimetry of the ly@xmath1 emission from a giant ly@xmath1 nebula associated with a radio - quiet active galaxy at z@xmath02.66 , but did not detect significant polarization .",
    "hayes et al . ( 2011 ) targeted a large ly@xmath1 nebula in a proto - cluster region at z@xmath03.09 , again using narrow - band imaging polarimetry , and detected polarized ly@xmath1 : they measured p=11.9@xmath32% within a radius of 7 , with a trend for p to be higher at larger radii , or in regions of low ly@xmath1 surface - brightness , and with electric field vectors consistent with illumination by a central source . a clear general picture of the polarization properties of high - redshift ly@xmath1 nebulae has not yet emerged , and more nebulae , with a wider range of properties , now need to be tested .",
    "the resonant nature of ly@xmath1 also allows detection of associated gaseous structures in front of the ly@xmath1 emitting source .",
    "many giant ly@xmath1 nebulae do indeed show strong hi absorption features in their ly@xmath1 velocity profile ( e.g. van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ; fosbury et al .",
    "2003 ; wilman et al . 2005 ; humphrey et al .",
    "these hi absorption features are usually black at their center , usually detected across the full spatial extent of the ly@xmath1 emission , and usually show a blueshift from the center of the ly@xmath1 emission ( see van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) , implying that the absorber is an expanding shell surrounding the ly@xmath1 nebula ( binette et al .",
    "the minimum shell radius , typically about @xmath550 kpc , allows important constraints on other properties of the shells ( mass , kinetic energy , etc . ; e.g. van ojik et al .",

    "we aim to probe the geometry , powering mechanism , and origin of the nebular and absorbing structures in this galaxy s gaseous environment ; understanding the physics of these systems is also important to shed light on the relevant feedback processes in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies .",

    "txs 0211 - 122 was observed using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) in polarimetry mode ( goodrich et al . 1995 ) , in sub - arcsecond seeing at the keck ii telescope , during 1997 december 24 - 26 .",
    "the 300 line mm@xmath8 grating and 1   wide slit resulted in an instrumental profile ( ip ) of 10  , a dispersion of 2.4    per pixel , and a spectral range of @xmath113900 - 9000    ( @xmath111200 - 2700    in the rest - frame ) .",
    "the 24   long slit was oriented approximately along the major axis of the radio source ( pa=104@xmath12 , north through east ) , to maximize signal to noise for extended emission .",
    "the total on - object exposure time was 28580 s , split into four sets of integrations , each with four integrations with the half - wave plate successively at pa=0@xmath12 , 45@xmath12 , 22.5@xmath12 , 67.5@xmath12 .",

    "2003 ) , consistent with infall ( humphrey et al .",
    "2007 ) , although near the galactic nucleus an excess of emission in the blue wing of heii suggests the presence of outflowing gas in addition ( humphrey et al . 2006 ) . at least in the bright",
    ", central few tens of kpc , the nebula is ionized predominantly by the radiation field of the active galactic nucleus , and has approximately solar metallicity ( v01 ; humphrey et al .",
    "the spatial distribution of the ly@xmath1 emission along the slit is strikingly asymmetrical compared to the continuum and the other emission lines ( fig . 1 and 2 ) , suggesting that the ly@xmath1 emission is either strongly absorbed , or is powered by a different mechanism than the other lines ( see also van ojik et al .",
    "1994 ; villar - martn et al . 2003 ; humphrey et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the polarization of the ly@xmath1 emission line can provide useful constraints on which excitation process powers the giant ly@xmath1 nebula ( e.g. dijkstra & loeb 2008 ; dijkstra & kramer 2012 ) . to this end , we have taken polarization measurements of the ly@xmath1 emission at different spatial positions along the slit .",
    "wavelength intervals were defined as the contiguous range of dispersion pixels with ly@xmath1 detected at s / n@xmath62 pixel@xmath8 .",
    "sky - subtraction was performed using a line and continuum free spatial bin covering an identical spectral range .",
    "unbiased values of the percentage polarization were estimated according to simmons & stewart ( 1985 ) , and uncertainties were determined using a monte - carlo method considering detector noise and background polarization ( vernet 2000 ) . throughout this analysis",
    "we adopt the spatial peak of the uv continuum ( and h@xmath1 emission ) along the slit as our fiducial position of the galactic nucleus of the radio galaxy .",
    "table 1 and figure 1 give the results of our ly@xmath1 polarization measurements .",
    "all upper or lower limits quoted in this letter are 3@xmath14 .",
    "we detect polarized ly@xmath1 emission , with p@xmath016.4@xmath34.6 % ( s / n@xmath03.6 ) and a pa of 154@xmath38@xmath12 , in a region 1.50 - 5.35   east of the nucleus ( aperture a in table 1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "the wavelength range covered by this aperture is 4046 - 4081  , and its ly@xmath1 emission has a total - flux s / n of 32 .",
    "weak continuum emission is also present at this position , with p@xmath015.3@xmath33.3 % and pa@xmath0194@xmath36@xmath12 measured in a wide bin covering the relatively line - free continuum region between the wavelengths of the nv and civ lines .",
    "thus , we have repeated the ly@xmath1 polarization measurement after subtracting the continuum emission that lies immediately redward of ly@xmath1 ( and nv ) at 4090 - 4140  , resulting in the noisier but nonetheless consistent measurement p@xmath023.1@xmath37.1 % with pa@xmath0143@xmath38@xmath12 .",
    "the core of ly@xmath1 emission ( 4067 - 4074  ) , however , does not show significant polarization at this spatial position ( p@xmath156.8 % ) . in the same spatial aperture ,",
    "the emission lines civ and heii have p@xmath1510 and p@xmath1513 % , respectively .",
    "the high surface - brightness ly@xmath1 emission closer to the nucleus is also not significantly polarized ( apertures b and c : @xmath1510.6 and @xmath154.7 % ) , while in the western nebula the data do not provide the necessary sensitivity for useful constraints ( aperture d : p@xmath1527.6 % ) .    as a check for our ly@xmath1 polarization detection in aperture",
    "a , table 2 lists ly@xmath1 polarization measurements using different combinations of the four integration sets .",
    "although noisier , these measurements show generally good consistency .",
    "this is the first detection of polarized narrow ly@xmath1 emission from a nebula associated with a radio - loud active galaxy , and only the second from an extragalactic nebula of any kind ( hayes et al .",
    "2011 ; see also prescott et al .",
    "our measurement of p@xmath016.4@xmath34.6 % for ly@xmath1 is consistent with the range in polarization predicted by models of ly@xmath1 scattering in hi halos around high - z galaxies ( up to @xmath1140 % : dijkstra & loeb 2008 ; dijkstra & kramer 2012 ) .",
    "together with the recent detection of polarized narrow ly@xmath1 in a high - z ly@xmath1 blob by hayes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , our new detection in txs 0211 - 122 then suggests it may not be uncommon for ly@xmath1 nebulae at high redshift to be powered ( at least partly ) by scattering of ly@xmath1 by hi .",
    "polarization measurements of a larger sample are now needed to ascertain whether or not this is generally the case for high - z ly@xmath1 nebulae .",
    "interestingly , the ly@xmath1 polarization pa ( 154@xmath38@xmath12 ) differs from that of the uv continuum by @xmath1130@xmath12 ( table 3 ; also v01 ) , implying that the resonantly scattered ly@xmath1 photons and dust - scattered uv continuum photons have different scattering geometries .",
    "at the eastern edge of the ly@xmath1 nebula we detect a faint , unresolved continuum source ( fwhm@xmath01.1@xmath30.1 ) , positioned 7.4@xmath30.2   e ( 61@xmath32 kpc ) along the slit , and a fainter one diametrically opposed at a position 7.3@xmath30.3   w ( 61@xmath32 kpc ; figure 2 ) .",
    "the eastern source is polarized , with p@xmath022@xmath36 % and pa@xmath0182@xmath37@xmath12 measured in the line - free region redward of the wavelength of the nv emission line , at 4260 - 4600    ( or 1280 - 1380    in the restframe ) .",
    "this polarization pa is close to perpendicular to the slit and to the radio source . for comparison ,",
    "we measure p@xmath021@xmath32 % and pa@xmath0185@xmath32@xmath12 in the same wavelength range using a 4.1aperture centered on the position of the central radio galaxy ( see also v01 ) . like the radio galaxy",
    ", the eastern source shows a strong gradient ( or decrement ) in p towards longer wavelengths , falling to p@xmath1510 % in the continuum region between the expected wavelengths of civ and heii .",
    "this wavelength dependence is consistent with a mixture of nebular continuum , which drops off sharply at @xmath4@xmath161300  , and scattered light ( v01 ) .",
    "the eastern source is also detected in h@xmath1 ( figure 2 ) , with fwhm@xmath01000@xmath3300 km s@xmath8 , and z@xmath02.335@xmath30.004 confirming its association with the radio galaxy .",
    "such a high fwhm suggests turbulent , rather than gravitational , motion .",
    "table 3 provides properties of this source , alongside those of the radio galaxy .",
    "previous modeling of the rest - frame ultraviolet emission from the extended narrow line region of the radio galaxy has shown that it is powered predominantly by illumination by the central agn ( v01 ; humphrey et al .",
    "interestingly , the spectral properties of the eastern source are very similar to those of the radio galaxy , in terms of the percentage and wavelength dependence of polarization , and also the relative fluxes of ly@xmath1 , h@xmath1 and the uv continuum ( table 3 ) .",
    "this , together with the fact that the polarization pa is perpendicular to the slit ( and to the radio source ) , leads us to conclude that the eastern source is also powered by illumination by the agn .",
    "the western uv source is detected across the full wavelength range between ly@xmath1 and ciii ] @xmath41908 , outside of which the sensitivity of the spectrum rapidly declines .",
    "its continuum flux density is 0.6@xmath30.2 @xmath1710@xmath18 erg s@xmath8 @xmath19 @xmath8 at 5300  .",
    "unfortunately , we can not ascertain its redshift because we detect no lines therefrom .",
    "a natural explanation for the diametric opposition of the two uv sources is that they are the limb of a giant shell of gas and dust centered on the radio galaxy , detected in emission thanks to illumination by the active nucleus .",
    "provided it has a sufficiently high covering factor , a shell like this also ought to be detected via strong , spatially extended absorption lines , including ly@xmath1 ( humphrey et al .",
    "indeed , txs 0211 - 122 does show a strong , spatially extended ly@xmath1 absorption feature in its spectrum when observed at moderate spectral resolution ( van ojk et al .",
    "1997 ) , as do around half of all radio - loud galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. van ojk et al . 1997 ; binette et al .",
    "2000 ; baker et al . 2002 ; humphrey et al .",
    "these giant hi absorbers are usually interpreted in terms of a giant shell of gas enveloping the galaxy and its ly@xmath1 nebula ( binette et al . 2000 ) .",
    "more specifically , txs 0211 - 122 shows an hi absorber with a blueshift of @xmath1160 km s@xmath8 from the ly@xmath1 emission , an observed diameter of @xmath610   ( @xmath683 kpc ) in the plane of the sky ( comparable to the size of the ly@xmath1 emitting nebula ) , a hydrogen column density of @xmath2010@xmath21 @xmath19 , and covering factor approaching unity ( van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we suggest that the diametrically opposed uv sources and the hi absorption are manifestations of a single structure : a shell of gas and dust enveloping the txs 0211 - 122 and its ly@xmath1 nebula .",
    "if this shell has a radius of 61 kpc and a hydrogen column density of @xmath2010@xmath21 @xmath19 , its total gas mass would then be @xmath54@xmath1710@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "although a pair of companion galaxies could be a potential alternative interpretation of the diametrically opposed uv sources , such a scenario would require a very fortuitous alignment between the two uv galaxies and txs 0211 - 122 .",

    "we now propose a scenario for the origin of the ly@xmath1 nebula and the gaseous shell associated with txs 0211 - 122 .",
    "the presence of dust and metals in the shell argue strongly for an internal origin for this structure , rather than an external one .",
    "we suggest that this shell is the result of a starburst event in the central galaxy , during which mechanical energy is deposited into the interstellar medium by supernova explosions , to produce expanding bubbles of gas .",
    "expanding bubbles produced by the individual supernovae sweep up material from the interstellar medium , merging with other bubbles as they expand , to eventually form a single superbubble of gas and dust centered on the galaxy . in the presence of a sufficiently luminous background source ( e.g. , the central radio galaxy ) ,",
    "this bubble will manifest itself as a spatially extended , narrow ly@xmath1 absorption feature with a blueshift with respect to the velocity of the ly@xmath1 _ emission _",
    "( e.g. tenorio - tagle et al . 1999 ; binette et al .",
    "moreover , depending on its properties , such as covering factor , radius , column density , etc . , the shell may also be detectable in emission where it intersects the radiation beams of the active nucleus ( humphrey et al .",
    "2013 ) , as appears to be the case in txs 0211 - 122 .    in its wake",
    ", the superbubble can be expected to leave behind condensations of infalling gas , resulting from energy dissipation during collisions between individual bubbles , or from blow - outs due to mass - loading . when irradiated by the active galactic nucleus",
    ", these condensations will emit narrow emission lines and thus may appear as an extended , infalling , ionized nebula around the galaxy ( e.g. , humphrey et al .",
    "2007 ; villar - martn et al . 2007",
    "; adams et al .",
    "2009 ) .    how many supernovae would be required to power the expansion of the shell ? assuming an expansion velocity of @xmath1160 km s@xmath8 and gas mass of @xmath64@xmath1710@xmath30 ( see @xmath314 ) , then the kinetic energy of the shell would be @xmath510@xmath32 erg .",
    "a single core - collapse supernova will release 10@xmath33 erg of kinetic energy , of which @xmath1110% can contribute to producing and powering the shell ( e.g. thornton et al .",
    "a total of @xmath510@xmath34 supernovae would then be required , in turn requiring the formation of @xmath510@xmath35 @xmath23 of stars ( e.g. heckman et al . 1990 ) .",
    "although txs 0211 - 122 shows no clear evidence for ongoing star formation ( v01 ) , _ spitzer _ irac photometry does permit a star formation rate of up to @xmath11200 @xmath23 yr@xmath8 , while also constraining the stellar mass to be @xmath151.4@xmath1710@xmath36 @xmath23 ( drouart et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "although it has been suggested that powerful radio jets can also sweep interstellar gas into shells ( e.g. krause 2002 ) , we believe this would not provide a natural explanation in the case of txs 0211 - 122 .",
    "our main objection is that a spatial correlation between the radio hotspots and the limb of the shell , which would be expected if the shell is driven by the jets , is not observed .",
    "i.e. , the eastern radio source has an observed length of @xmath1150 kpc , and the western one has a length of @xmath1190 kpc ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 ) , both of which are very different to the 61 kpc radius of the shell .",
    "we have analyzed deep spectropolarimetry and spectroscopy of the z@xmath02.34 radio galaxy txs 0211 - 122 and its gaseous environment , aiming to understand the origin , geometry and power source of high redshift ly@xmath1 nebulae .",
    "although the polarization of ly@xmath1 is low centrally ( p@xmath24.7 % ) , it rises to p@xmath016.4@xmath34.6 % at a distance of @xmath612 kpc ( 1.5 ) east of the galactic nucleus .",
    "this indicates that the giant ly@xmath1 nebula is partly powered by the scattering of centrally - produced ly@xmath1 photons in a spatially extended gaseous envelope . this is the first detection of polarized ly@xmath1 emission , to date , from a nebula around a radio loud active galaxy , and only the second from any extragalactic ly@xmath1 nebula .    at the extreme edges of the ly@xmath1 nebula , at a radius corresponding to 61 kpc , we have detected a pair of diametrically opposed uv sources .",

    "we have argued that the observed configuration of the gaseous environment of txs 0211 - 122 can be naturally understood in terms of the expansion of a starburst driven bubble through the galaxy and its gaseous halo , spreading metals and dust out to radii of @xmath1161 kpc .",

    "<S> we present spatially resolved spectropolarimetic measurements of the 100-kpc scale gaseous environment of the z@xmath02.34 radio galaxy txs 0211 - 122 . the polarization level of the narrow ly@xmath1 emission is low centrally ( p@xmath25 % ) , but rises to p@xmath016.4@xmath34.6 % in the eastern part of the nebula , indicating that the nebula is at least partly powered by the scattering of ly@xmath1 photons by hi . not only is this the first detection of polarized ly@xmath1 around a radio - loud active galaxy , it is also the second detection to date for any kind of ly@xmath1 nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect a pair of diametrically opposed uv continuum sources along the slit , at the outer edges of the ly@xmath1 nebula , which we suggest may be the limb of a dusty shell , related to the large - scale hi absorbers often associated with high - z radio galaxies . </S>"
