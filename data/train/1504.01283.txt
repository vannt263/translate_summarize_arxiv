    "one of the main goals of combinatorial representation theory , as described in the survey article  @xcite , is to provide explicit formulas which express the values of characters of interesting representations as weighted enumerations of nice combinatorial objects .",

    "* section  7.17 ) for the irreducible characters of the symmetric group @xmath0 .",
    "several such formulas of a more specific type , expressing characters of the symmetric groups and their iwahori  hecke algebras in terms of the distribution of the descent set over classes of permutations , or other combinatorial objects , have been discovered in the past two decades .",
    "the prototypical example is roichman s rule  @xcite for the irreducible characters of @xmath0 ( and the corresponding hecke algebra ) , where the enumerated objects are either knuth classes of permutations , or standard young tableaux .",
    "other notable examples include the character of the gelfand model ( i.e. , the multiplicity - free sum of all irreducible characters )  @xcite , characters of homogenous components of the coinvariant algebra  @xcite , lie characters  @xcite , characters of specht modules of zigzag shapes  @xcite , characters induced from a lower ranked exterior algebra  @xcite and @xmath2-root enumerators  @xcite , determined by the distribution of the descent set over involutions , elements of fixed coxeter length , conjugacy classes , inverse descent classes , arc permutations and @xmath2-roots of the identity permutation , respectively .",
    "the formulas in question evaluate these characters by @xmath3-weighted enumerations of the corresponding classes of permutations , where exactly the same weight function appears in all summations .",
    "some new examples are given in sections  [ sec : conj][sec : arc ] of this paper .",
    "an abstract framework for this phenomenon , which captures all aforementioned examples , was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "characters which are expressed by such formulas ( see definition  [ def : finea ] ) are called _ fine characters _ , and",
    "classes which carry them are called _",
    "fine sets_. it was shown in  @xcite that the equality of two fine characters is equivalent to the equidistribution of the descent set over the corresponding fine sets .",
    "this implies , in particular , the equivalence of classical theorems of lusztig  stanley in invariant theory  @xcite and foata  schtzenberger in permutation statistics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in  @xcite that fine sets can be characterized by the symmetry and schur - positivity of the associated quasisymmetric functions .",

    "equidistribution and schur - positivity phenomena , similar to those in  @xcite , are easily derived from theorem  [ thm : main ] ( see corollary  [ cor : main ] ) .",
    "sections  [ sec : knuth][sec : arc ] show that nearly all examples of fine @xmath0-characters mentioned earlier have natural @xmath1-analogues .",
    "these include the irreducible characters of @xmath1 , the gelfand model , the characters of the natural @xmath1-action on the homogeneous components of the coinvariant algebra of type @xmath5 , signed analogues of the lie characters , characters induced from exterior algebras and @xmath2-root enumerators , with corresponding fine sets consisting of elements of knuth classes of type @xmath1 , involutions , signed permutations of fixed flag - inversion number or flag - major index , conjugacy classes in @xmath1 , signed analogues of arc permutations and @xmath2-roots of the identity signed permutation , respectively .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] implies explicit formulas for these characters in terms of the distribution of the signed descent set over the corresponding fine sets .",
    "section  [ subsec : derange ] is concerned with the character of the @xmath0-action on the top homology of the poset of injective words , studied by reiner and webb  @xcite , and with its natural @xmath1-analogue .",
    "this allows us to interpret a theorem of dsarmnien and wachs  @xcite on the equidistribution of the descent set over derangements and desarrangements in @xmath0 in the language of @xmath0-fine sets , and to derive a @xmath1-analogue .",
    "the latter task provided much of the motivation behind this paper .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows",
