    "safe and efficient hydrogen storage is one of the biggest barriers to the more wide spread usage of hydrogen as an energy carrier or fuel . currently , commercial solutions are based on liquid or compressed gas storage methods , which are inefficient and have safety issues .",
    "alternative storage methods include metal hydrides , which are formed by the interaction between a suitable metal and hydrogen .",
    "the relatively strong metal - hydrogen bonds provide an intrinsically safe storage medium .",
    "the release of hydrogen from the hydride is then achieved by heating the material above a certain decomposition temperature .",
    "there are a large number of metals in nature that form hydrides , however , only the lighter ones are thought to be suitable candidates for mobile hydrogen storage purposes ( see @xcite for an overview ) . beside being light weight",
    ", a hydride will need to have good cyclability ( several hundred times with little loss of performance ) , fast adsorption / desorption kinetics ( the hydride should form / decompose on a time scale of minutes ) and low decomposition temperature ( ideally between 20 and 100 celsius ) .",
    "magnesium is a good case study due to its lightweight , low cost , cyclability and the high h storage capacity of 7.6% by weight once the hydride mgh@xmath0 is formed  @xcite .",
    "however , its commercial application is still on hold for practical issues due to low h absorption / desorption kinetics and high working temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the strong bond between mg and hydrogen provides mgh@xmath0 with high thermodynamic stability , which has an enthalpy of formation of about -76 kj / mol  @xcite , and a decomposition temperature of more than 300 celsius  @xcite .",
    "the slow kinetics may be explained by the high energy barrier which needs to be overcome ( see for example  @xcite ) to dissociate the h@xmath0 molecule due to the tendency of mg to repel the s - electron of h because of the pauli exclusion principle  @xcite .",
    "a step forward in improving hydrogen reaction kinetics has been achieved by the mechanical ball milling of mgh@xmath0 with transition elements ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hydrogen storage properties of mechanically milled powders improves because of the reduced powder size ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , which shorten the diffusion distance of h into bulk mg for the formation of the hydride .",
    "there are many experimental and theoretical papers in the literature showing that the hydriding properties of mgh@xmath0 are further enhanced by the addition of traces of transition metals which act as a catalyst ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , alloying mg with ni can slightly improve the thermodynamic properties of the hydride by favouring h@xmath0 adsorption / dissociation and consequent atomic hydrogen absorption / desorption due to a weakening of the bonding between mg and h atoms ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) .    while from theoretical calculations the destabilization effect of ni on mgh@xmath0 appears second only to cu ( see  @xcite ) , experimentally ni shows the highest kinetics , with cu falling behind . as suggested by shang et al .",
    "@xcite , cu results are disadvantageous for h desorption probably because of the formation of a mgcu@xmath0 compound .",
    "recently , a new method of chemical fluid deposition in supercritical fluids has been used on metal hydrides  @xcite .",
    "even sparser literature exists for the activation barrier of hydrogen dissociation on a transition metal doped surface , which includes only the theoretical calculations made by du et al .",
    "@xcite within dft ( rpbe ) for both the pure mg(0001 ) , and ti and pd incorporated mg surfaces .",
    "their results show that the dissociation barrier of hydrogen on the ti doped mg surface is greatly reduced ( in fact , there is no barrier at all ) due to the strong interaction between the hydrogen @xmath1 orbital and the ti @xmath2 orbital , however , strong binding of the two h atoms near the ti site prevents easy diffusion , reducing therefore the efficacy of the catalyst for mg hydrogenation  @xcite .",
    "palladium doping appears to both lower the dissociation barrier and the diffusion barrier , suggesting a better catalytic activity .",
    "their findings are consistent with the experimentally observed trend of generally improved hydrogen absorption kinetics when mg surfaces are doped with transition metals , as previously mentioned .    to our knowledge ,",
    "so far there is no published theoretical investigation of h@xmath0 dissociation and corresponding activation barrier on a ni - incorporated mg surface , nor a systematic investigation of the catalytic effect of other transition metal dopants apart from the above mentioned studies on the ti - doped and pd - doped mg surfaces presented by du et al .",
    "there are a few theoretical papers about the dissociation of molecular hydrogen on a pure mg surface where the corresponding activation barrier has been effectively calculated .",
    "these investigations were based on a jellium model and potential energy surface(pes ) calculations within density functional theory ( dft ) with the local density approximation(lda ) or generalised gradient corrections ( rpbe )  @xcite .    for the purpose of a larger scale investigation , we have performed dft calculations for hydrogen dissociation and diffusion on a ni - doped mg surface , accompanied by analogous calculations on a ti - doped mg surface for a consistency check with the recently reported theoretical values .",
    "this study should be regarded as a first step in order to build up a global picture of the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen when doping the mg surface with different transition metals .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to try to understand the observed large enhancement of the kinetics of hydrogen adsorption by mg when it is doped with a small quantity of ni , but not when it is doped with ti .",
    "the computational results are supported by experimental data where a ni doped mg sample is hydrogenated substantially faster than the reference mg or ti doped mg .",
    "dft calculations were performed with the ab - initio simulation package vasp  @xcite using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite and the pbe exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",
    "an efficient charge density extrapolation was used to speed up the calculations  @xcite .",
    "a plane - wave basis set was used to expand the electronic wave - functions with a plane - wave energy cut - off of 270 ev , which guarantees convergence of adsorption energies within 1 mev . for completeness , mg bulk parameters were also calculated using the lda functional .",
    "monkhorst - pack * k*-points were used to sample the brillouin zone  @xcite . a smearing function of the methfessel - paxton ( mp ) type ( product of a gaussian times a @xmath3th - order hermite polynomial )  @xcite",

    "[ adssites ] , [ mgh2diss ] - [ mgnih2diff ] and [ charge ] have been made using the xcrysden software  @xcite .",

    "activation energies have been calculated using the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method  @xcite .",
    "a sufficient number of replicas has to be used in order to predict accurately a minimum energy path ( mep ) , for most cases we repeated the calculations with a different number of replicas until convergence of the activation energy and main features of the mep were observed .",
    "the total number of images actually used in each case is reported where relevant in the following sections .",
    "magnesium bulk crystal at ambient conditions has the hexagonal closed packed ( hcp ) structure .",
    "several preliminary tests were first carried out using the pbe version of the paw potential of magnesium , which only includes the 3@xmath4 electrons in valence and has a core radius of 1.1   .",
    "these included : the energy dependence on the @xmath5 ratio for different * k*-points meshes , from a minimum of 56 to a maximum of 880 * k*-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ( ibz ) ; different values of @xmath3 for the mp smearing functions and different smearing widths ; and different plane - wave cutoffs . to calculate the bulk structural properties of mg , energy versus volume curves were fitted to a birch - murnaghan equation of state  @xcite .",
    "we found that with a 18x18x12 * k*-point mesh ( 259 points in the ibz ) , @xmath6 and a smearing width of 0.2 ev , the zero pressure equilibrium volume @xmath7 and bulk modulus @xmath8 of bulk mg were converged to within 0.2% and 0.3% respectively .",
    "similar convergence results were obtained with the standard lda potentials , which also has only the 3@xmath4 electrons in valence and a core radius of 1.1   .",
    "results are summarised in table  [ table1 ] , together with results from previous theoretical calculations .",
    "the well known trend of lda to overestimate the bulk modulus and underestimate the lattice parameter  @xcite is apparent .",
    "finally , we have tested pbe and lda paw potentials with 2@xmath9 and 3@xmath4 electrons in valence .",
    "these potentials still have core radii of 1.1   but require an higher energy cut - off value of 350 ev . the structural parameters obtained with these potentials are essentially identical to those obtained with the previous potentials . therefore , in the rest of the work we only used the standard mg potentials .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      to study the electronic properties of the system , we projected the electronic density of states onto spherical harmonics functions of type @xmath1 , @xmath28 and @xmath2 , centred on mg , ni , ti and h atoms .",
    "it is well known that the catalytic reactivity of a surface is correlated to the position of the @xmath2-band ( i.e. , in this case the projection of the electronic density of states onto @xmath2 type spherical harmonics ) with respect to the fermi energy @xmath29 . in particular ,",
    "it was shown by hammer and norskov  @xcite(see also  @xcite ) that a convenient parameter to monitor the catalytic reactivity is the first energy moment of the @xmath2-band , or @xmath2-band centre , defined as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density of states projected onto spherical harmonic of type @xmath2 centred on some specified atom , and @xmath32 is some cutoff energy which we chose to be at 7 ev above the fermi energy . then , if the centre of the band is close to @xmath29 it follows that there are many @xmath2 electrons available for donation , as well as a significant number of empty @xmath2-levels available for back - donation , and the results of this is that the system is very reactive .",
    "the @xmath2 electrons of ni on mg(0001 ) form a band which is relatively close to the fermi energy and for this reason the system is very reactive . by contrast , mg has no @xmath2 electrons ( although in the solid state a projection onto @xmath2 type spherical harmonics is not zero ) , and therefore its reactivity is much reduced by comparison .",
    "ni is a late transition metal with almost all the @xmath2 orbitals filled with electrons , by contrast ti only has 2 electrons in the @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "it is therefore clear that the position of the @xmath2-band centre will be much higher in ti than in ni , which explains the higher reactivity of ti .    our calculated values for @xmath33 on the ni / ti - doped mg surfaces are -0.79 ev and + 1.08 ev for ni and ti respectively ( see table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "using dft rpbe , vegge et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the @xmath2-band center position for mgtm ( tm @xmath24 transition metal ) alloys , allowing an expansion of the alloy lattice to accomodate the hydrogen atoms .",
    "they found -0.82 and + 0.48 for tm = ni , ti respectively .",
    "although the value we find for ti is much larger , the same trend is observed in the case of our ni / ti - doped mg surfaces .",
    "figures  [ dosmg]-[dosmgti ] show the projected density of states ( pdos ) found for the pure mg , ni - doped and ti - doped mg surfaces respectively .",
    "the pdos are given for a number of configurations along the mep : the initial state ( is ) , the transition state ( ts ) , the replica just after the transition state ( ts+1 ) and the final state ( fs ) .",
    "for the ti - doped mg surface , the pdos are given for is and fs only since there is no transition state in the dissociation process .",
    "for somplicity of notation , we call here the transition state and the final state simply ts and fs , as we only refer to the part of the mep which deals with the dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule .    in the is the hydrogen molecule is still far from the metal surface and there is no overlap between the h@xmath0 molecular orbitals and the orbitals of the metal surface . at the transition state , instead , when gaseous hydrogen has started dissociating over the surface , there is clear interaction between the h @xmath1 orbital and the mg @xmath1 and @xmath28 orbitals on the pure mg surface ( see fig .  [ dosmg ] , top - right corner ) . on the ni - doped surface the overlap appears to be non - zero with all the ni @xmath1 , @xmath28 and @xmath2 orbitals ( see fig .",
    "[ dosmgni ] , top - right corner ) .",
    "in the final state it is evident that the magnitude of the mg @xmath28 electron peaks below the fermi level are increased in the ni / ti - doped surfaces ( see respectively fig .",
    "[ dosmgni ] , bottom - right corner , and fig .",
    "[ dosmgti ] , right ) with respect to the pure mg surface ( see fig .",
    "[ dosmg ] , bottom - right corner ) .",
    "interestingly , we note that there appears to be a clear negative shift of the position of the hydrogen @xmath1 orbital in going from the initial state to the transition state , which is more pronounced for the pure mg surface as opposed to the ni - doped mg surface .",
    "besides the @xmath2-band center positions , in table  [ table3 ] we also report the corresponding activation barriers ( @xmath34 ) , the energy difference between the initial and final states ( @xmath35 ) for hydrogen dissociation , and the h @xmath1 peak shift between the initial and transition states ( h@xmath36@xmath37 ) .",
    "the correlation between the position of the @xmath2-band and the height of the activation barrier is evident , as well as the correlation with @xmath35 , i.e. , the @xmath2-band center position is smaller for larger values of the former and smaller values of the latter .",
    "furthermore , from the results obtained for the pure mg and ni - doped mg surfaces , another interesting correlation emerges .",
    "in fact , as shown in table  [ table3 ] , it appears that h@xmath36@xmath37 correlates with both @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. , it is smaller for smaller values of the former and for larger values of the latter , following a reversed trend with respect to that noticed for the @xmath2-band center position . in other words",
    ", this means that the shift of the hydrogen @xmath1 orbital between initial state and transition state is larger when the bond between the dopant and h atoms is weaker .      to conclude our analysis we decided to have a look at the charge distributions in the systems as the dissociation processes take place on the pure mg and metal - doped mg surfaces .    to do this , we calculated the total charge at each step of the mep , and for convenience , we subtracted the charge densities obtained from calculations which included only the substrate and only the h@xmath0 fragments respectively , with the atoms in exactly the same positions .",
    "this charge difference obviously integrates to zero , and has the advantage of showing point by point where the charge is being transferred to .",
    "the analysis reveals some interesting effects . in particular , on the pure mg(0001 )",
    "surface we find that at the transition state there is a significant charge transfer from the mg substrate to the h atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ charge ] - left ) .",
    "this extra charge fills the h antibonding orbitals which eventually leads to dissociation , and builds up on the molecule because the mg surface is unwilling to accept back - donation of electrons from the h atoms .",
    "the coulomb energy of this charge transfer is probably the main contribution for the energy barrier .",
    "by contrast , on the ni doped surface there is almost no charge transfer from the substrate to the molecule at the transition state ( see fig .  [ charge ] - right ) .",
    "this is because while some ni @xmath2 charge fills up the h@xmath0 antibonding orbitals , charge from the molecular bonding orbital is back - donated to the empty @xmath2 states available on the surface . as a result",
    ", the energy barrier is reduced to almost zero .",
    "the three samples prepared were mgh@xmath0 , 2%ni / mgh@xmath0 and 2%ti / mgh@xmath0 .",
    "three batches of 25 gram samples were prepared by ball milling the different compositions for 2 hours under 4 bar of hydrogen .",
    "the mgh@xmath0 used for all is goldschmidt 98% pure .",
    "the ni used ( 99.9% pure ) was from alfa aesar 0.8 - 0.03 @xmath38 m diameter as was the ti used ( @xmath3920 @xmath38 m and 93% pure ) .",
    "25 g of both 2%ni / mgh@xmath0 and 2%ti / mgh@xmath0 were mixed in a tubular mixer before milling for one hour .",
    "samples were then milled using the fritsch planetary ball mill pulverisette 5 .",
    "the milling pots have a special stainless steel jacket with an o - ring fitted on the top seal , this can allow a gas atmosphere through a feeding valve , to be used during the milling process of up to 5 bar .",
    "25 grams of sample were milled using agate pots ( around 300cc volume ) and 15 balls of the same material .",
    "the milling process was 2 hours using 350 rpm in a 15 minute mill 10 minute pause sequence .",
    "the rig used for testing the sample has a 10 cc reactor pot containing 1 gram of sample .",
    "the main lines of the rig are a hydrogen line regulated to a 7 bar gauge , an argon line and a vacuum line .",
    "the inert gas line and a vacuum line are used for purging the system .",
    "the reactor is connected to an inlet flow controller , a pressure transducer to read the internal pressure and a mass flow meter outlet .",
    "a thermocouple in close contact with the powder load reads the sample temperature .",
    "a heating jacket cartridge is attached to the reactor allowing the system to operate in isothermal conditions or be temperature programmed from a control box which uses the sample thermocouple as a reference value .",
    "an interface card records inlet flow , outlet flow , temperature and pressure every second .",
    "volumetric hydrogenation and dehydrogenation cycles were possible to monitor using this arrangement .",
    "hydrogenations were performed at 300 c using 25 cc min@xmath40 of hydrogen from a regulator set at 7 bar gauge . during the hydrogenation",
    "the pressure increases to a point where the sample starts absorbing and forms a plateau pressure , once the sample is fully hydrogenated the reactor keeps building pressure until seven bar are reached .",
    "dehydrogenations were recorded by flowing 25cc / min of hydrogen through the reactor using an inlet flow controller .",
    "the system is then open to vent for a chosen temperature or heating slope and any hydrogen evolving from the sample is recorded as an increase in the 25cc min flow by an outlet flowmeter .",
    "the hydrogenation plots of the 2% ni / mg sample at different temperatures in the range between 290 and 320 c are shown in fig .",
    "the hydrogenation of the 2%ti / mg sample in the temperature range between 290 and 310 c is shown in fig .",
    "[ jm2 ] . both graphs of hydrogenation show p mbar gauge vs time in seconds .",
    "the hydrogenation of pure mg gave results close to the ti doped samples and is therefore not shown .",
    "the catalytic activation of mg by ni during hydrogenation is clear .",
    "the plateau pressures for each temperature hydrogenation are lower for the 2%ni / mg sample than those of mg and 2%ti / mg . the fact that at 290 c the hydrogenation curve for 2%ni / mg is still lower than the hydrogenation in the same conditions at 300 c confirms this . at 290",
    "c both mg and 2%ti / mg showed a higher hydrogenation pressure than at 300 c suggesting ti catalysisof mg hydrogenation is not evident .",
    "we have presented a dft study of hydrogen dissociation and diffusion over ni - doped and ti - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces , and compared these with dissociation and diffusion on pure mg(0001 ) .",
    "our results show that the energy barrier for hydrogen dissociation is high on the pure mg surface ( 0.87 ev ) , and it is small ( 0.06 ev ) or even null when ni or ti are used as dopants respectively .",
    "we also found that although on the pure mg(0001 ) surface the binding energy of the h fragments is nearly zero , on the ni / ti -doped surfaces this binding energy is significant , being 0.66 and 1.34 ev respectively , with diffusion energy barriers of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43ev on the pure mg , ni - doped and ti - doped surfaces respectively .",
    "more insight in the behaviour of these systems can be gained by inspecting the partial density of states and by looking at the electronic charge density distributions .",
    "in particular , the higher reactivity of ti with respect to ni can be understood in terms of a lower position of the @xmath2-band centre , which correlates with both the height of the energy barriers for the dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule and with the binding energy of the h fragments when adsorbed on the surface .",
    "the charge density distributions on the different systems also shows some interesting behaviour .",
    "in particular , we argued that the presence of a barrier on the pure mg(0001 ) surface may be understood in terms of the build up of extra charge on the h@xmath0 molecule as it moves closer to the surface .",
    "this happens because the closed shell mg surface is unwilling to accept back - donation of charge from the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "one consequence of this is that the molecule needs to arrive very close to the surface before starting to dissociate .",
    "by contrast , ni and even more so ti have many available empty @xmath2-states , and this avoids significant charge transfer from the substrate to the molecule . in this case , the dissociation of the molecule begins much further away from the surface .",
    "the low dissociation barrier , coupled with the low diffusion barrier , make ni a very useful promoter for the hydrogenation of mg .",
    "by contrast , the high dissociation barrier on the pure mg surface , and the high diffusion barrier on the ti - doped surface , are responsible for the slow kinetics of hydrogenation on both systems .",
    "our experimental findings show faster hydrogenation for the 2%ni / mg sample with respect to the reference mg or the 2%ti / mg , in good agreement with our theoretical results of a lower activation energy for the dissociation - diffusion process in the 2%ni / mg system .",
    "the behaviour of mg and 2%ti / mg upon hydrogenation is found to be very similar , again agreeing very well with the theoretical findings of large and similar activation energies : a dissociation energy barrier of 0.87 in the pure mg system , and a diffusion energy barrier of 0.8 ev in the 2%ti / mg system , making the dissociation - diffusion process similarly difficult in both cases .",
    "we deliberately chose to study ni and ti as dopants because they are at the two ends of the first row of transition metals , and so their behaviour may be expected to be representative of a range of properties .",
    "in fact , we are now extending our investigations to other transition metals , and we plan to report on these new results in the near future .",

    "<S> it is well known , both theoretically and experimentally , that alloying mgh@xmath0 with transition elements can significantly improve the thermodynamic and kinetic properties for h@xmath0 desorption , as well as the h@xmath0 intake by mg bulk . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a density functional theory investigation of hydrogen dissociation and surface diffusion over ni - doped surface , and compare the findings to previously investigated ti - doped mg(0001 ) and pure mg(0001 ) surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the energy barrier for hydrogen dissociation on the pure mg(0001 ) surface is high , while it is small / null when ni / ti are added to the surface as dopants . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the binding energy of the two h atoms near the dissociation site is high on ti , effectively impeding diffusion away from the ti site . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we find that on ni the energy barrier for diffusion is much reduced . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although both ti and ni promote h@xmath0 dissociation , only ni appears to be a good catalyst for mg hydrogenation , allowing diffusion away from the catalytic sites . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results corroborate these theoretical findings , i.e. faster hydrogenation of the ni doped mg sample as opposed to the reference mg or ti doped mg . </S>"
