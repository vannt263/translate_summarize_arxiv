    "two - dimensional systems of electrons submitted to the simultaneous influences of the periodic potential and of a homogeneous external magnetic field have received great interest @xcite in the last four decades .",
    "such studies led to the celebrated harper equation @xcite : @xmath0which has been extensively investigated .",
    "this equation originates from the influence of the minimal subtitution on the energy dispersion law . here",
    "@xmath1 denotes the dimensionless energy , which comes from a single band tight binding description with nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "further , @xmath2 denotes the anisotropy parameter , while @xmath3 stands for a commensurability parameter expressing the number of flux quanta per unit cell .",
    "the magnetic flux and the flux quantum are denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , while @xmath6 stands for the brillouin phase .",
    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) , is a second order discrete equation which has been studied numerically in terms of the transfer matrix method by hofstadter @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the spectrum is characterized by a nested band structure i.e. by the so called hofstadter - butterfly . besides experimental relevance @xcite ,",
    "the harper - equation provides ideas for useful applications concerning electrons on lattices under the influence of a transversal magnetic fields @xmath7 @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the influence of the spin - orbit interaction @xmath8 @xcite produce sensible effects @xcite .",
    "such results open the way of controlling  the electron s spin under the influence of an external electric field or of a gate voltage , too @xcite .    in order to investigate the influence of the rashba-@xmath9 ( @xmath10 on the harper model",
    ", we shall supplement the harper hamiltonian with the discretized version of the rashba energy term : @xmath11where @xmath12 is the rashba coupling parameter , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for momentum operators , as usual .",
    "this later discretization has its own interest as it provides the possibility to account for the influence of an underlying electric field in a rather consistent manner .",
    "this differs , of course , from the magneto - electric harper equation discussed before @xcite . in this paper one deals with the numerical energy - bands realization of the superposition of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",
    "now by accounting for selected wave functions .",
    "such solutions concern spin-_up _ and spin-_down _ wave functions , respectively , but inter - related ones will also be considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the discretized @xmath17 model as well as the derivation of the coupled equations are presented in section @xmath18 .",
    "numerical investigations of the coupled equations are done in section @xmath19 by resorting to some selected wave functions .",
    "first one accounts solely for the influence of the spin-_up _ and spin-_down _ wave functions , respectively , which is reminescent to spin - filtered systems .",
    "next , one deals with inter - related spin-_up _ and spin-_down _ wave functions .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section @xmath20 .",
    "in order to implement the discretized version of @xmath17 into the harper model , we have to resort to the modified interaction hamiltonian@xmath21where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for this purpose one",
    "proceeds by applying the minimal substitution to ( [ 2 ] ) , by using the landau - gauge for which the vector potential is given by @xmath25 .",
    "next , one resorts to the factorization@xmath26where @xmath27 and @xmath28stands for spin-_up _ and spin-_down _ wave functions , respectively .",
    "this leads to the @xmath29-hamiltonian@xmath30where@xmath31    on the other hand , the harper - equation is generated by the energy dispersion law @xmath32under the influence of the peierls substitution .",
    "this results in the substitution rules @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these rules are responsible for the onset  of the harper - hamiltonian such as given by@xmath35\\text { . }",
    "\\label{8}\\ ] ]    one would than obtain the second - order discrete equation@xmath36which reproduces equation ( [ 1 ] ) in terms of the space - discretization @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "what then remains is to establish the discretized version of equation ( [ 5 ] ) , by proceeding via@xmath39where @xmath40 stands for discrete derivative .",
    "it is understood that@xmath41    accordingly , @xmath42 and @xmath40become identical to first @xmath43-order .",
    "this shows that the discretization one looks for , is provided by the modified substitution rule@xmath44which stands for the discrete counterpart of equation ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalue equation characterizing the total hamiltonian is then given by@xmath45where @xmath46 denotes the total energy and where @xmath47  stands for the discretized @xmath29-hamiltonian .",
    "this results in the coupled equations@xmath48+{\\large \\varphi } _ { \\downarrow } ( n)\\frac{\\gamma } { a}% ( k_{2}a+2\\pi \\beta n )   \\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\]]with@xmath49+{\\large \\varphi } _",
    "{ \\uparrow } ( n)\\frac{\\gamma } { a}% ( k_{2}a+2\\pi \\beta n )   \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath50 contains the rashba coupling parameter . in order to highlight the meaning of the coupled equations",
    ", we shall resort , this time , to some quickly tractable simplifications .",
    "at this point we have to realize that @xmath51 can be established in terms of the effective mass @xmath52 of the electron as @xmath53 . using @xmath54m@xmath55  and @xmath56",
    "nm silber then gives @xmath57mev .",
    "in addition one has @xmath58evm @xcite .",
    "a first simplification is to assume that spin - down wave functions are zero @xmath59 * * , * * which can be viewed as relying on spin filter devices @xcite or spin separation processes @xcite .",
    "this ansatz  leads to a @xmath60 spin - selection and @xmath61 , as@xmath62with@xmath63which proceed irrespective of @xmath64 . under such conditions we obtain@xmath65   \\label{18}\\]]with@xmath66   \\label{19}\\]]so that@xmath67and@xmath68    applying the standard transfer matrix method , one obtains   @xmath69which can be generalized via@xmath70    this amounts to consider@xmath71where@xmath72supposing that@xmath73    note that @xmath74 case , which will be assumed hereafter , represents the critical point of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "we are by now in position to perform numerical studies in accord with ( [ 24])-([25 ] ) .",
    "one realizes that this time , the usual symmetries of the harper - spectrum like such as the exact energy reflection symmetry @xmath75 and the @xmath76-symmetry , i.e. the symmetry under @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , cease to be fulfilled .",
    "the understanding is that by virtue of the @xmath60-selection one deals with a different experimental situation .",
    "the flux dependence of the energy bands when @xmath60 ( i.e. @xmath79 ) is displayed in @xmath80 , as illustrated by the bands located in the upper half plane .",
    "however , we can also select @xmath81 ( instead of @xmath82 ) , in which case one deals with @xmath83 ( instead of @xmath60 ) . @xmath84    @xmath80  the flux dependence of energy bands for @xmath60 ( upper    half plane ) and @xmath83 ( lower half plane ) .",
    "@xmath85    this time the energy - bands get located inside the lower half plane .",
    "one remarks that bands become increasingly dispersed as the magnetix flux increeases .",
    "this means that @xmath76- symmetry is completely lost . when the flux approaches unity , the bands become equidistant , in accord with the behavior of landau levels .",
    "such patterns can be gathered together as @xmath86 in which @xmath60 or @xmath83 , respectively . in addition",
    "there is @xmath87 and@xmath88which is responsible for energy reflection symmetry .",
    "the next approximation is to consider inter - related spin-_up _ and spin-_down _ wave functions say @xmath89 @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a real parameter . @xmath92@xmath93",
    "@xmath94  the flux dependence of energy bands for subunitary values of the    @xmath91-parameter , like @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    @xmath85    one would then obtain@xmath97{\\large \\varphi } _ { \\uparrow } ( n)=\\ ] ]    @xmath98    with@xmath99{\\large \\varphi } _ { \\uparrow } ( n)=\\ ] ]    @xmath100    by virtue of ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath101    @xmath102  the flux dependence of energy bands for    values of supraunitary modulus of the @xmath91-parameter ,    like @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    ".    @xmath85    these later equations lead in turn to@xmath105and@xmath106where @xmath107 so that @xmath108 is vanishingly small . in addition@xmath109and@xmath110denotes the energies from ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) . using again the method of the transfer matrix",
    ", one finds energy - band realization which are rahter sensitive to @xmath91 .",
    "in addition we have to remark that by now @xmath1 is an even function of @xmath91 . when @xmath111 , the energy bands exhibit dispersions decreasing with @xmath112 , as shown in @xmath94 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we have to remark that in this latter case energy dispersion effect get inhibited , now by preserving both energy reflection and @xmath76-symmetries .",
    "we have also to remark that the plots displayed in @xmath94 for @xmath114 reflect , within a reasonable approximation , the onset of a two level configuration , say@xmath115proceeding irrespective of the magnetic flux .",
    "such configurations are of a special interest for applications in the field of optoelectronics ragha , allen .",
    "next we found that supraunitary values of the @xmath91 parameter lead to an asymmetric location in the flux dependence of energy bands , as shown in @xmath116 for @xmath103 and @xmath117 .",
    "one sees that in the later two cases the energies exhibit positive values , only .",
    "in this paper we have investigated both theoretically and numerically the competition effects between the harper model and the discretized @xmath17 .    coupled equations for the spin dependent wave functions",
    "have been established in some particular cases . unlike the harper spectrum , which , is characterized by exact symmetries mentioned before , the presence of the @xmath118 leads to dispersion effects in the flux dependence of the energy bands , excepting the @xmath114 plots in @xmath94 .    using the transfer matrix technique",
    ", we found that the @xmath17 produces dispersive effects in the energy dependence on the magnetic flux .",
    "such effects get visualized by a sensible alteration of the rather symmetrical nested energy sub - bands characterizing the self - similar structure of the usual harper spectrum .",
    "we then have to realize that , excepting of course the special @xmath114 case mentioned above , both energy - reflection and @xmath119-symmetries are lost .",
    "our first but restrictive approximation is to account only for the influence of spin-_down _ and spin-_up _ wave functions , respectively .",
    "the modified energy bands established in this manner are displayed in @xmath80 .",
    "in other words we found that supplementing the harper - hamiltonian with the discretized @xmath17 leads to significant modifications of energy bands , which serves to a better understanding of the electronic structure .",
    "this opens the way to further applications concerning the influence of the spin - orbit effect , with a special emphasis of two - level realizations mentioned above which are of interest in the field of optoelectronics .",
    "more general wave functions can also be considered , but such goals go beyond the immediate scope of this paper ."
