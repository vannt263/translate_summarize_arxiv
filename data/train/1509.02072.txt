    "the fast unitaries @xmath183 and @xmath184 can be parameterized using canonical coordinates of the second kind ( see section  2.8 of @xcite , section  2.10 of @xcite , or chapter  iii , section  4.3 of @xcite ) , i.e.    [ eq : k2 ] @xmath188    the surjectivity of the representations in eq .",

    "we apply eq .   and the euler - angle decomposition multiple times and obtain @xmath233 for certain values of @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 . in summary ,",
    "we have verified the surjectivity of the representations @xmath232 and @xmath183 .",
