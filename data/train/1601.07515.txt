    "in the last two decades , more and more countries have adopted a deregulated electricity market policy . in these countries ,",
    "an inverse auction mechanism is implemented each day in order to determine , for the next day , which generating units will be operating , how much electricity will be supplied by each one of them , and its unitary price .",
    "since the electrical sector is of utmost importance in any country s economy , it is important to understand various aspects of the corresponding market .",
    "one of such aspects is the _ expected aggregated supply curve _ , which will be refered to as _ supply curve _ for short , resulting from the competition among generating firms .",
    "it has been observed that the supply curve for each of the years in the period @xmath1-@xmath2 , in the colombian electricity market ( a deregulated one ) , are well fitted by suitably scaled @xmath0-exponential curves , where the values of @xmath0 vary from year to year and are generally different from @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath0-exponential behavior or @xmath0-deformed behavior in general , has been observed in quantities arising in similar contexts . in @xcite",
    "certain quantities associated to the czech republic public procurement market ( an auction type market ) , for the period @xmath4-@xmath5 , are analyzed .",
    "specifically , those authors look at the behavior of three quantities , namely , the probability that a contract has @xmath6 bidders or more , the probability that a public procurement selling agent makes @xmath7 euros or more during the observed period ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) , and the probability that a contracting authority spends @xmath7 or more euros during the observed period , as functions of @xmath6 in the first case , and @xmath7 in the second and third cases . they observe that the first function is very well approximated by certain exponential , while the second and third functions , are very well approximated by certain power functions . now , exponential functions and power functions correspond to @xmath0-exponentials , with @xmath8 in the first case and @xmath9 in the second one . in @xcite the probability distribution of certain quantities associated to the opening call auctions in the chinese stock market are studied .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the probability distribution of order sizes is well fitted by certain @xmath0-gamma function . + even though the presence of @xmath0-deformed behavior , with @xmath9 , may be taken as evidence of complexity in the dynamics governing the corresponding processes , illegal interaction between participants and so on , it is still valid to ask whether there is already @xmath0-deformed behavior , with @xmath9 , in situations having low complexity and complete transparency .    in this article",
    "we study the presence of @xmath0-deformed behavior in the seemingly most simple situation arising in deregulated electricity markets .",
    "concretely , we consider an electricity market composed of a number of generating firms , each one having a single generating set capable of supplying ( after normalization ) one electricity unit per day whose production cost is assumed ( after normalization ) to be zero . in addition , the demand is a discrete random variable whose probability distribution is known by all firms . as was mentioned before , the firms compete each day in a reverse auction in order to be selected as an electricity supplier for the next day .",
    "this simple market can be thought as a repeated game in the framework of classical game theory , i.e. one in which players are rational and have complete knowledge of the game structure .",
    "therefore , we assume that players place their bids according to a nash equilibrium . after calculating and solving a differential equation",
    "whose solution is the unique symmetric nash equilibrium possesed by this game , we estimate the supply curve by simulating repetitions of this game .",
    "we observed that for various background probability distributions for the demand , and a range of numbers of generating firms , the supply curves are well fitted by @xmath0-exponential curves , usually with @xmath9 , and that for fixed background distribution , the value of @xmath0 gets closer to @xmath3 as the number of generating firms increases . towards the end of the paper",
    "we propose a plausible explanation for these phenomena .",
    "in this section we closely follow @xcite .",
    "we assume that the electricity generating system is formed by @xmath10 electricity generating firms @xmath11 , and that each firm @xmath12 has @xmath13 generating units or sets @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the total number of sets of the whole generation system .",
    "each set @xmath16 can produce at most @xmath17 electrity units per day and has a cost function @xmath18 , assigning to each @xmath19 , the cost @xmath20 of producing @xmath0 electricity units using @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the total daily capacity of the generating system .",
    "we assume that the amount of electricity demanded by the consumers in one day is a random variable @xmath22 that distributes according to certain cumulative distribution function @xmath23 supported on some interval @xmath24\\subset [ 0,k]$ ] .",
    "policies for the market demand that firms can only offer unitary prices lying within certain interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "it is assumed that all the information above is common knowledge .",
    "the mechanism by which electricity is bought is the following .",
    "each day ( day @xmath26 ) , each @xmath12 secretely submits a vector @xmath27 to a coordinating entity , expressing its willingness to produce the next day ( day @xmath28 ) , using set @xmath16 , any amount of electricity in the interval @xmath29 $ ] , and to sell it at a unitary price of @xmath30 . at this point",
    "we emphasize the fact that the generators decide on their price vectors knowing the distribution @xmath23 but without knowing the particular value it takes the next day .",
    "once the coordinating entity receives all these @xmath10 vectors , it chooses a _ ranking _ of the prices , i.e. a bijective function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 whenever @xmath33 .",
    "notice that this choice is not unique whenever there exist pairs @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath36 is the partition induced on the set @xmath37 by the equivalence relation @xmath38 iff @xmath35 , the number of choices is @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 denotes the number of elements of the set @xmath41 .",
    "this number will be denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "the coordinator randomly selects one of the possible rankings according to a uniform distribution , i.e. with probability @xmath43 .",
    "once a ranking @xmath44 is chosen , the coordinator looks at the actual demand of electricity @xmath22 for day @xmath28 .",
    "it is useful at this point to rename the generating units and all the entities associated to them , according to their rank , i.e. to denote the unit @xmath16 by @xmath45 , @xmath17 by @xmath46 , and so on .",
    "the coordinator considers the numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , and determines @xmath50 .",
    "then the coordinator dictates that on day @xmath28 , each unit @xmath51 with @xmath52 will supply its full capacity @xmath53 , that unit @xmath54 will supply @xmath55 units of electricity , and that each unit of electricity will be paid at price @xmath56 .",
    "it is understood that units @xmath51 with @xmath57 will not supply any electricity and therefore will not receive any payment .",
    "the utility for firm @xmath12 is therefore given by @xmath58   +   \\sum_{j=1}^{\\rho-1}\\delta_n(j)\\left[k_jp_{\\rho}-c_{j}(k_j)\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is @xmath3 if @xmath60 belongs to firm @xmath12 and is zero otherwise .",
    "since we will consider the case when ( i ) each generator @xmath12 has a single generating unit @xmath61 , ( ii ) each generating unit has capacity @xmath3 , ( iii ) all cost functions are @xmath62 , ( iv ) the demand is a discrete random variable taking values @xmath63 , and ( v ) @xmath64 ; _ these five conditions will be assumed to hold for the rest of the paper_. in this case it is important to slightly modify our notation . instead of writing @xmath65",
    "we will write @xmath66 , respectively . the renaming of units and associated entities induced by a ranking @xmath44 keeps being the same as before , i.e. @xmath67 are renamed as @xmath68 , respectively .    the assumption that firms want to maximize their utilities",
    ", naturally leads to the interpretation of the whole situation as the repetition of a three stage game : first , firms choose their prices in the interval @xmath69 $ ] , then nature chooses a value for the demand according to some probability distribution @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and finally the coordinator makes the dispatchment according to the rules already explained .",
    "notice that the latter step involves a random choice in order to resolve ties .",
    "the utilities for each firm depend on the prices being offered by all firms , the value taken by the demand and the particular ranking chosen by the coordinator .",
    "this game can thought as a random experiment , whose sample space is @xmath72 , d\\in \\{1,\\ldots , n\\ } , r \\",
    "\\text{a ranking for } \\",
    "( p_1,\\ldots , p_n)\\right\\}\\ ] ] with probability density function @xmath73 ( pdf ) having the form @xmath74 here @xmath75 are some pdf s . in this setting the utility functions @xmath76 become random variables .",
    "the functions @xmath75 according to which firms choose their prices , form a nash equilibrium , if for each @xmath77 , the expected utility of firm @xmath77 , @xmath78 for any other pdf @xmath79 .",
    "it is equivalent but much easier to work with the corresponding cummulative distribution functions @xmath80 .",
    "these will be nondecreasing functions defined on @xmath69 $ ] , having value @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath3 at @xmath83 , and admitting ( jump ) discontinuities .    according to proposition 6 in @xcite @xmath84 is a ( symmetric ) nash equilibrium if and only if @xmath85 is a nondrecreasing function defined on a closed interval @xmath86 $ ] with @xmath87 , such that @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and satisfying the differential equation    @xmath90    where    @xmath91    and @xmath92    we remark that this differential equation derives from the general fact that a profile of mixed strategies @xmath80 is a nash equilibrium if and only if for each @xmath77 , the ( expected ) profit of firm @xmath12 assuming that it plays the pure strategy @xmath93 while any other firm @xmath94 plays according to @xmath95 , is independent of @xmath96 .",
    "we observe that this differential equation can be solved by separation of variables .",
    "in order to survey the behavior of supply curves in general , we wrote routines in mathematica 10.1 and used them for testing various scenarios .",
    "the main routine , called granprogramap , assumes @xmath97 and for given distribution of background demand , and positive integers @xmath10 and @xmath98 , it first determines the differential equation [ derivada ] , finds the solution @xmath85 to this differential equation subject to the condition @xmath99 , and then , for each @xmath100 , it produces an @xmath10-vector @xmath101 , by first making @xmath10 independent ( random ) choices of numbers in the interval @xmath102 $ ] according to @xmath85 , sorting these numbers in increasing order , and finally computing the average @xmath10-vector @xmath103 .",
    "finally , the mathematica command nminimize is applied to find , among the curves @xmath104 with @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 whenever @xmath108 , one that ( approximately ) minimizes the quadratic error @xmath109    next we present the considered scenarios and the results obtained in each case .",
    "the reason for the kind of experiment performed in each of these scenarios is clarified in section [ analysis ] .",
    "the following four experiments have the following common structure . we assume a market with @xmath10 generating firms , each of them capable of producing @xmath110 units per day at production cost zero , and with demand being a discrete random variable taking values @xmath111 for @xmath71 , with probability @xmath112 for a fixed probability distribution @xmath113 supported on the interval @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "we refer to @xmath113 as the _ background distribution _ for the demand .",
    "this is of course equivalent to a market with @xmath10 generating firms , each of them capable of producing @xmath3 unit per day at production cost zero , and with demand being a discrete random variable taking values @xmath71 , with probability @xmath115 so the experiments only differ by the choice of background distribution . in all four experiments",
