    "the dynamics and roughening of moving interfaces in disordered media has been a subject of great interest in non - equilibrium statistical physics since the 1980s .",
    "relevant examples of physically and technologically important processes include thin film deposition  @xcite , fluid invasion in porous media  @xcite , and wetting and propagation of contact lines between phase boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the underlying physics involved in interface roughening is crucial to the control and optimization of these processes .",
    "significant progress in the theoretical study of interface dynamics has been made and a number of theories have been developed  @xcite , which in some selected cases agree well with the experimental findings @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical understanding in this field is based on modeling interface roughening with a local stochastic equation of motion for the single - valued height variable of the interface .",
    "however , there are several cases of interest where such an approach can not be justified _",
    "e.g. _ due to conservation laws in the bulk .",
    "this is especially true for processes such as fluid invasion in porous media , which is often experimentally studied by hele - shaw cells  @xcite or imbibition of paper  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in such cases spatially local theories can not provide a complete description of the underlying dynamics .",
    "for describing the diffusive invasion dynamics in such systems , a phase - field model explicitly including the local liquid bulk mass conservation law has been developed and applied to the dynamics of 1d imbibition fronts in paper  @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by a generalized cahn - hilliard equation with suitable boundary conditions , which couple the system to the reservoir .",
    "numerical results for roughening from the model are in good agreement with relevant experiments @xcite .",
    "one of the great advantages of the phase - field approach is that it s possible to analytically derive equations of motion for the phase boundaries in the so - called sharp interface limit @xcite .",
    "most recently , we have developed a systematic formalism to derive such equations for the 2d meniscus and 1d contact line dynamics of fluids in capillary rise  @xcite .",
    "the equations are derived from the 3d bulk phase - field formulation , using variational approach as applied to relevant rayleigh dissipation and free energy functionals . through successive projections , equations of motion for",
    "the 2d meniscus and 1d contact line can be derived .",
    "the leading terms of such equations ( for small amplitude , long wavelength fluctuations ) can be shown to agree with results obtained from the sharp interface equations in the appropriate limits @xcite .",
    "in addition to the need for non - local models to account for mass conservation , in hele - shaw and imbibition type of problems the inherent quenched disorder should be properly taken care of .",
    "unlike thermal disorder , which is relatively easy to handle , quenched disorder depends on the height of the 1d interface @xmath0 as @xmath1 .",
    "this makes its influence on interface roughening highly nontrivial , often leading to anomalous scaling @xcite .",
    "currently , for such cases good agreement between theory , simulations and experiments has not been achieved . even on the experimental side some results such as the quantitative values of the scaling exponents , are not consistent and difficult to interpret .",
    "very recently , soriano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite conducted an experimental study of forced fluid invasion in a specially designed hele - shaw cell . the quenched disorder pattern in hele - shaw cell is realized by creating large number of copper islands that randomly occupy the sites of a square grid on a fiberglass substrate fixed on the bottom hele - shaw cell .",
    "three different disorder patterns were used .",
    "two of them are obtained by random selection of the sites of a square lattice .",
    "the third kind of disorder is formed by parallel tracks , continuous in the interface growth direction and randomly distributed along the lateral direction .",
    "it was found that for forced flow the temporal growth exponent @xmath2 which is nearly independent of experimental parameters and disorder patterns .",
    "however , the spatial roughness exponent @xmath3 was found to be sensitive to experimental parameters and disorder patterns .",
    "anomalous scaling with @xmath4 , and a local roughness exponent @xmath5 was found in disorder pattern with parallel tracks along the growth direction .",
    "it was also demonstrated that such anomalous scaling is a consequence of different local velocities on the tracks and the coupling in the motion between neighboring tracks .    on the theoretical side , for non - local hele - shaw and paper imbibition problems",
    "there are two different approaches within the phase - field models to include additive quenched disorder .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite put the quenched disorder inside the chemical potential , the gradient of which is the driving force for interface motion . on the other hand , hernandez - machado _ et al . _",
    "@xcite accounted for the effect of fluctuation of hele - shaw gap thickness as a mobility with quenched disorder in the phase - field model , while keeping the chemical potential free of noise .",
    "these two approaches lead to quantitatively different roughening properties .",
    "when considering the problem of capillary rise in a typical hele - shaw cell set - up between two rough walls more microscopically , the location of the surface of such corrugated walls in the cartesian coordinate system is a spatially fluctuating quantity , which indicates the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "an experimental realization is given in @xcite . to treat this problem faithfully , in solving the phase - field equation",
    "such a fluctuating wall surface should be treated as a physical boundary without phenomenologically adding quenched noise to the equation of motion as done previously .",
    "consequently it is evident that a rigorous analytic treatment of such a problem is overwhelmingly difficult .",
    "however , in this paper we demonstrate that with proper mathematical formulation of the problem , it is possible - albeit with some approximations - to analytically derive equations of motion for the meniscus and contact line dynamics .",
    "most importantly , these equations incorporate the wall disorder in a natural way . to achieve this",
    ", we utilize an explicit curvilinear coordinate transformation of the phase - field equation in order to apply projection methods to unravel the relevant physics in the limit of small disorder . to some extent ,",
    "this kind of curvilinear coordinate transformation is similar to the boundary - fitted coordinate system frequently used in computational fluid dynamics ( cfd )  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in chapter [ 2d ] we will consider the phenomenological 2d phase field model of capillary rise with quenched disorder in the mobility , similar to that in refs .",
    "we will adapt the systematic projection method of kawasaki and ohta @xcite to obtain a linearized interface equation ( lie ) that describes small fluctuations of an interface , whose deterministic part reduces to the previous result @xcite in a special limit . to treat the problem rigorously , in chapter [ 3d ]",
    "we will consider the full 3d phase field model with corrugated walls as the source of quenched disorder .",
    "the transformation to curvilinear coordinates , as discussed above , is introduced to obtain linearized , effective bulk disorder from the original curvilinear boundary condition . following this we develop and apply a general projection scheme @xcite to obtain the effective equations of motion for small fluctuations of the 2d meniscus , and ultimately for the 1d contact line between the meniscus and the wall .",
    "again , the deterministic parts of these equations reduce to previously known limits in special cases .",
    "however , we demonstrate that the forms of the quenched noise terms derived here are different from the previous works .",
    "a 2d phase - field model explicitly including the local conservation of bulk mass was introduced to study capillary rise by dub _",
    "the bulk disorder in their model was included in the effective chemical potential . recently a similar model , where the disorder was considered through a stochastic mobility coefficient , was studied by hernandez - machado _ et al .",
    "in particular , they assumed a one - sided mobility coefficient , which vanishes on one side of the interface . from this model they derived an equation of motion for small interface fluctuations . in this section , we will use the systematic projection method introduced by kawasaki and ohta @xcite , to derive the corresponding linearized interface equation ( lie ) describing small fluctuations in a sharp interface in a similar model . in our model",
    "we assume the mobility to be independent of the phase , as in the previous works @xcite , but spatially stochastic , as in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to considering the invading fluid and the porous medium , but not the receding fluid .",
    "this picture is valid when the receding fluid has low density and viscosity . in practice",
    "this would mean a gas , such as air , being displaced by a liquid , such as water or oil .",
    "the model allows a systematic projection of the effective noise term at the interface .",
    "the phase field model describes capillary rise at a coarse - grained level with a phase field @xmath6 that obtains the value @xmath7 in the phase of the displaced fluid , and @xmath8 in the phase of the displacing fluid .",
    "the phase field thus describes the effective component densities , and thus must be locally conserved .",
    "an energy cost for an interface is included to obtain the free energy as @xmath9=\\frac{1}{2}[\\nabla\\phi(\\mathbf{x , t})]^2 + v(\\phi(\\mathbf{x , t})),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 has two minima at @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "the details of @xmath10 are not relevant in the sharp interface limit , except to define the surface tension , so we can choose the standard ginzburg - landau form @xmath11 , where one of the phases can be set metastable by nonzero coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "the equation of motion for the conserved phase field is given by the continuity equation @xmath13 and fick s law @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the mobility that we choose to be a position dependent stochastic variable here .",
    "the resulting equation of motion for the phase field is then given by @xmath17 = m\\nabla\\cdot ( 1+\\xi(x))\\nabla\\left[v'(\\phi)-\\nabla^2\\phi\\right],\\ ] ] where the variable @xmath18 is now the dimensionless , quenched noise .",
    "the sharp interface limit of this model without the noise is well known , and discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "the geometry of the problem is that of a half - plane , where a reservoir of the displacing fluid is located at the @xmath19-axis .",
    "the boundary condition of the chemical potential at the half - plane boundary can be connected to the physical effect that is driving the capillary rise . in this paper",
    "we will consider spontaneous imbibition , where the rise is driven by a chemical potential difference in the medium , which favors the displacing fluid @xcite .",
    "this means that the two minima of @xmath10 are at different heights . in our notation",
    "the chemical potential difference is @xmath20 , and we consider chemically homogenous medium , where @xmath21 .",
    "spontaneous imbibition corresponds to a dirichlet boundary condition at the reservoir @xcite .",
    "forced flow , where flow is caused by an imposed mass flux into the system from the reservoir , can be modeled with the neumann boundary condition , where @xmath22 is the flux @xcite .",
    "an analysis along the lines presented in this paper can also be conducted for the case of forced imbibition .",
    "a recent review of phase field modeling of imbibition is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    using the green s function @xmath23 for the 2d laplacian",
    ", equation can be inverted using gauss s theorem .",
    "this leads to the integro - differential form @xmath24 notation here has been shortened by omitting the function arguments , and using unprimed and primed functions for functions of unprimed and primed coordinates , respectively .",
    "the green s functions always take both primed and unprimed coordinates as argument .",
    "also the coordinate invariant form is used , with integration measure given by @xmath25 .",
    "the boundary term @xmath26 vanishes in the case of spontaneous imbibition , or dirichlet boundary condition in half - plane geometry .",
    "using the standard 1d kink solution method for projection to sharp interface @xcite in normal coordinates gives eq .",
    "as @xmath27\\\\ + \\int du\\partial_u\\phi_0\\int ds'du'\\sqrt{\\det(g')}g\\nabla'^2\\xi'(\\kappa'\\partial_{u'}\\phi_0'+\\alpha ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the normal coordinates @xmath28 are distances along and perpendicular to the interface , respectively , @xmath29 is the local curvature of the interface , @xmath30 is the surface tension of the phase field model , and finally @xmath31 is the 1d kink solution @xmath32 . in the ginzburg - landau form of @xmath10",
    "this would be given by @xmath33 , with the appropriate choice of dimensionless units .",
    "we have assumed a disorder correlation length that is larger than the interface width , which leads to the constant surface tension obtained . with two further approximations",
    "is approximated with its form for the 1d disorder free system : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the normal velocity .",
    "this approximation is similar to the 1d kink solution in the standard procedure , but its range of extent is not only near the interface , but between the reservoir and interface .",
    "another assumption we made in the derivation is neglecting boundary terms of form @xmath36 .",
    "this is justified when the width of the kernel @xmath37 along @xmath19-direction , which is of order @xmath38 , is much larger than the correlation length of the disorder @xmath18 . ]",
    "the standard procedure @xcite can be followed . transforming the equation to cartesian coordinates",
    "is made somewhat more tedious by the necessity to transform derivatives w.r.t . @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath40 , but standard differential geometry methods can be applied . after the sharp interface limit , i.e. @xmath41 , the transformation to cartesian coordinates , and linearization in small fluctuations of the interface @xmath42 and the noise @xmath18 , which also eliminates cross terms proportional to @xmath43 , we get the lie as @xmath44\\partial_t\\big[h_0(t)+h(x',t)\\big]=\\\\ -\\sigma\\partial_x^2h(x , t)-\\alpha+\\frac{\\partial_th_0(t)}{m}\\xi(x , h_0(t ) ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the disorder term @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 note that the linearization has been carried out in full here .",
    "this means that the disorder term does not include any dependence on the interface fluctuations .",
    "this eliminates the non - linearity of the quenched noise , which is one of its characteristic properties , but we believe it is not crucial in the regime where the linearization is appropriate . in other words ,",
    "our results show non - trivial features that arise in the effective noise at the interface level with this type of multiplicative bulk disorder , even in the linear regime of weak disorder .    the green s function for the dirichlet boundary condition in half - plane geometry is explicitly given by @xmath47 using this , the fourier space representation of the interface equation   becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the fourier transform of the chemical potential difference ( @xmath51 , if @xmath52 , when @xmath53 ) , and the disorder in fourier space is given by @xmath54 in the case of columnar disorder , which does nt depend on @xmath55 , the interface equation simplifies to @xmath56 it is noteworthy that the limit @xmath57 the interface equation is @xmath58 , readily giving the correct washburn law @xcite , if we associate @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "our method of analysis can be applied to the case of forced flow by simply changing the boundary condition of the phase field model at the reservoir , and applying the corresponding green s function @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation above is the main result in this section .",
    "it involves two length scales : a crossover length scale @xmath61 @xcite , and the distance from the reservoir @xmath62 .",
    "the deterministic part of the dispersion relation is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : dispersion ] , at the two limits of these length scales : the limit @xmath63 brings out the `` deep '' limit , @xmath64 , behavior .",
    "the limit @xmath65 shows the `` shallow '' limit , @xmath66 , behavior . a plot from the intermediate regime with @xmath67",

    "@xcite for the case of disorder in the chemical potential . in the `` deep '' limit where @xmath68",
    ", our result also reproduces that of hernandez - machado _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the one - sided mobility case .",
    "using different methods the same result has also been obtained for the hele - shaw setup by paune and casademunt @xcite , and ganesan and brenner @xcite .",
    "our disorder term in the lie is similar to those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite in the sense that in all cases the effective noise is linearly proportional to the velocity of the interface propagation . however , the quantitative forms of the noise terms are different when using different methods .",
    "how these differences influence the kinetic roughening of interfaces would need to be determined by extensive numerical comparison between the different results , which at this point has not been conducted . as a linear @xmath69 proportionality in the fourier space representation of the effective noise term",
    "is linked to the @xmath55-derivative of the green s function of the laplacian in real space representation , it appears to us that the linear @xmath69 is present in the noise terms of refs . @xcite and @xcite , but not in ref .",
    "the linear @xmath69 dependence is in general characteristic of effective interface noise caused by conserved bulk disorder @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath70 dependence ( @xmath71 ) dimensionally cancels the integral over the kernel in the effective noise , eq .. this is explicit in the case of columnar disorder in eq . , but is equally valid with the noise in the non - columnar case .",
    "thus the multiplicative bulk disorder in the mobility leads to a different type of effective noise than the chemical potential disorder , which is considered in @xcite .",
    "dimensionally this can be seen from the definition of the model , eq .",
    ", where the noise term is in front of the gradient of the chemical potential .",
    "the fact that the columnar disorder leads to effective noise , which is local in fourier space , is in accordance with the conclusions of experiments of soriano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and with the numerical results from the one - sided model @xcite .",
    "this would indicate that the phase dependence of the mobility is not crucially important when considering the invasion of a viscous fluid into a fluid with negligible viscosity , and when the interface is consequently always stable .",
    "when the direction of the invasion is reversed , as studied recently with the one - sided model in @xcite , the situation is naturally quite different .",
    "while the stochastic mobility case of the previous section is heuristically appealing , a more faithful treatment of the wall disorder should start from the microscopic roughness of the walls . to this end , in this chapter we will study a 3d version of the same phase - field model as the 2d model , but where the mobility is constant and the disorder is explicitly included as fluctuations of the wall position .",
    "thus the geometry of the model is that of a hele - shaw cell : the 3d volume between two walls that are planar on average , but fluctuate .",
    "we will show here that by proper mathematical formulation this model can indeed be analyzed by a generalized projection formalism @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to perform a mathematical transformation from the basic cartesian to a local curvilinear coordinate system as defined by the wall itself . to this end , we consider the one - wall setup as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the one - wall setup neglects the meniscus - mediated interaction between the two contact lines at the two walls .",
    "the one - wall approximation also neglects finite gap spacing , i.e. the distance between the two walls in the hele - shaw cell , which fluctuates as result of the wall fluctuations .",
    "this induces additional disorder effects when the wall fluctuations are comparabale to the gap spacing , but it remains to be studied if the gap effect can be separated from the contact line interaction , which would be represented by two coupled equations of motion for the two contact lines . in the present work , we only consider to the one - wall approximation , or the limit of large gap spacing .",
    "disorder at the wall surface is taken into account by describing local corrugations in the wall position around @xmath72 by a ( small ) function @xmath73 .",
    "the explicit coordinate transformation to the local , curvilinear wall coordinate system is defined by @xmath74 which corresponds to @xmath75 when @xmath73 .",
    "this means that in the new coordinate system the wall is located back at @xmath75 .",
    "given the proper green s function , @xmath76 the phase field equation can be inverted in any geometry and coordinate system as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the corresponding surface term , and @xmath79 is the volume element for the coordinate system .",
    "the green s function appropriate for the above mentioned coordinate system is considered in some detail in appendix [ curvy ] . here",
    "we compute the correction to the original cartesian green s function to linear order in @xmath80 .",
    "the final result we obtain , after neglecting some surface contributions that are discussed in more detail in appendix [ curvy ] , is what one would expect by simply plugging the above definitions into the cartesian green s function and linearizing in @xmath81 : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the green s function for the laplacian in 3d cartesian coordinates as given in eq . .",
    "here we again only consider spontaneous capillary rise , where the boundary conditions for the phase field model are zero chemical potential at the reservoir and zero flux at the walls .",
    "thus the surface integral term in eq .",
    "is identically zero .",
    "the projection and linearization of the integral equation follows the standard projection operation theory @xcite , which we already used in the previous chapter for the 2d model .",
    "the generalization for the present case is straightforward . after projection the integral equation is expressed in terms of the 2d meniscus variable @xmath84 and has the following form : @xmath85 when linearizing the above equation , it must be done simultaneously in the meniscus fluctuations , _ i.e. _ @xmath86 , and in the wall fluctuations using the linearized green s function of eq .. this results in the linearized green s function evaluated at the meniscus : @xmath87 substituting this into the meniscus equation gives @xmath88 where the left hand side equation is to the zeroth order , and the right hand side is to the first order in @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "these terms are defined in the same fashion as those in cartesian coordinate system  @xcite .",
    "the terms @xmath91 and @xmath92 arise from the fluctuating wall .",
    "they are given by @xmath93 the zeroth order equation would give the washburn law , if we used the green s function for the geometry between two walls and assumed a constant curvature for the meniscus .",
    "we will assume an average profile @xmath94 , which can be considered to obey washburn s law even though we have only a single vertical wall in the system . since @xmath62 is not needed for determining the form of the evolution equation for the fluctuating part @xmath42 of eq .",
    "at that single wall , the precise time - dependence of @xmath62 is not crucial for the analysis to be presented below .",
    "a local equation of motion for the meniscus fluctuations can be obtained by fourier - cosine transformation following @xcite .",
    "the above terms become @xmath95&= & \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{h}_0h(\\vec{k},t ) ; \\\\ { \\mathcal{f}}_{x / k_x}{\\mathcal{f}}^{cos}_{y / k_y}[i_{c}]&= & \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2kh_0}\\dot{h}_0h(\\vec{k},t ) ; \\\\ { \\mathcal{f}}_{x / k_x}{\\mathcal{f}}^{cos}_{y / k_y}[i_{d}]&= & \\frac{1}{2k}\\dot{h}(\\vec{k},t)\\left(1-e^{-2kh_0}\\right ) ; \\\\",

    "we then have the meniscus equation of motion using the above in the fourier transform of eq .",
    ": @xmath97 the deterministic part of the above meniscus equation is identical to the deterministic part of the lie derived from the 2d phase - field model , apart from the dimensionality .",
    "this is by construction , since the same method was used for the same theory in different dimensions by applying the corresponding green s functions .    a similar analysis",
    "can also be performed for the case where the disorder at the walls consists of chemical impurities ( _ i.e. _ spatially fluctuating surface tension ) instead of spatial roughness @xcite . in this case",
    "the deterministic part of the meniscus equation is by construction identical to that of the above .",
    "however , there is no effective noise at the meniscus level , since the effect of the disorder comes in from the contact line that serves as a boundary condition for the meniscus .      to proceed to the level of the 1d contact line we consider the generalized variational approach @xcite .",
    "formally , one can write the 3d phase field model in terms of variations of a rayleigh dissipation functional , and a free energy functional . then , using approximations that express higher dimensional entities in term of the relevant lower dimensional ones , we obtain a chain of projection equations as @xmath98 } { \\delta \\dot { \\phi}(x , y , z;t ) } & = & -   \\frac { \\delta f_{\\textrm { 3d}}[\\phi ] } { \\delta \\phi(x , y , z;t ) } \\\\ \\label{2d_functional_eom } \\rightarrow   \\frac { \\delta r_{\\textrm { 2d } } [ \\dot h ] } { \\delta \\dot h ( x , y;t ) } & = & -   \\frac { \\delta f_{\\textrm { 2d}}[h ] } { \\delta h(x , y;t ) } \\\\ \\rightarrow   \\frac { \\delta r_{\\textrm { 1d } } [ \\dot c ] } { \\delta \\dot c ( x;t ) } & = & -   \\frac { \\delta f_{\\textrm { 1d}}[c ] } { \\delta c(x;t)}\\ , , \\label{ray}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 refers to the rayleigh dissipation functional , and @xmath100 refers to the free energy functional in @xmath101 dimensional space . here",

    "however , at machine precision away from @xmath128 then these errors are no more than 15% , and more importantly the error of the complete dispersion relation stays within the 3% error margin .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dispersion remains finite , as one can see from figure [ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "apart from simple numerical factors , the contact line equation above has the same functional form as the results derived in the previous sections . in particular , @xmath129 in the `` deep '' limit @xmath130 , which thus agrees with the previous works discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "this form of dispersion relation is always obtained by our method for interfaces in model b. this has to do with the quasi - stationary approximation , which essentially assumes that meniscus fluctuations dampen quickly in the direction perpendicular to the contact line , in order to obtain temporally local equations .",
    "how this leads to the coupling of the meniscus and contact line dynamics is discussed in more detail in another publication @xcite .",
    "the effective noise term we obtain from the 3d model shares the property of linear dependence on the velocity of the propagation with the 2d mobility noise , and with the previous analyses @xcite . in the case of surface tension impurities at the wall @xcite the effective contact line noise is proportional to @xmath131 , whereas in the fluctuating wall case in eq .",
    "the @xmath132 dependence is linear .",
    "this is analogous to the 2d mobility disorder in the sense that the effective noise is different from that obtained for conserved disorder .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath133 as compared to the 2d model ( eq . ) comes from the fact that the disorder in the 3d model comes from the walls , whereas in the 2d model the disorder is in the bulk .",
    "we note that the more complicated properties of the noise in the form of non - locality in fourier space are lost by our approximations .",
    "note that the noise is still non - local in real space , as is apparent from its real space representation @xmath134 in eq . .",
    "in addition to fourier space non - localities , our one - wall approach does nt explicitly include the gap spacing , which provides an additional physical length scale . in spite of this , our results are in accordance with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gap fluctuations were considered as the only source of disorder in context of darcy s law .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effective interface dynamics of the three - phase contact line in a hele - shaw experiment by deriving the meniscus and contact line equations of motion from higher dimensional bulk phase - field theories by projection methods .",
    "the projection methods take into account the non - local dynamics of the system caused by local mass conservation , and can be systematically applied starting from a full 3d description .",
    "we have here considered two particular models , namely an _",
    "ad hoc _ model where the disorder is in the effective mobility in 2d @xcite , and a more microscopic model where wall corrugation in 3d is explicitly treated with a curvilinear coordinate transformation . in both cases , we have focused on the limit of small disorder by linearizing in disorder strength and in the fluctuations caused by the disorder . by construction",
    "this linearization , performed in real space , causes the fourier space representations of the equations of motion to be local .",
    "the upside of this is that the effective dynamics are written in a concise manner , and the physical predictions are easily interpreted and the equations we obtain are readily affable to numerical analysis .",
    "the obvious downside is that the procedure involves a number of approximations , the validity of which is not certain _ a priori_.    in particular , the quasi - stationary approximation of eq .",
    ", which ultimately enables our contact line analysis , requires a critical assessment .",
    "a more rigorous approach would in fact consider the contact line as the boundary condition to the meniscus equation of motion .",
    "however , explicitly solving the meniscus profile as a function of the contact line leads to an equation that is , among other things , non - local in time .",
    "thus we are forced to simplify the model by using the qs approximation , the validity of which we can consider both from a physical perspective , or more rigorously by considering the limits of the meniscus equation of motion .",
    "physically , the qs approximation comes from the minimum of meniscus energy constrained by the boundary condition of the contact line .",
    "this is expected to define the meniscus profile when the meniscus moves slowly , and thus it s called the quasi stationary approximation .",
    "mathematically the meniscus equation reduces to the diffusion equation when @xmath135 , and @xmath136 . in this limit",
    "the meniscus level disorder @xmath137 acts as a source term @xmath138 this leads to an additional disorder term in the qs approximation , which then leads to a plethora of new first order disorder terms in @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "however , all these new disorder terms arising from @xmath139 are proportional to @xmath141 , and thus not relevant in the qs limit .",
    "additionally , the two new disorder terms created in @xmath140 due to @xmath137 cancel each other out exactly .",
    "thus , we expect our results with the simplified version of the qs approximation to hold in this particular limit .",
    "in addition to the detailed derivations and new projection formalism presented here , our purpose has been to quantitatively compare two different approaches to modeling rough wall hele - shaw experiments , namely that based on the 2d phase field model with a stochastic mobility , eq . , and the 3d phase field model with a fluctuating geometry .",
    "the projection method we use for both cases produces the linear response of the meniscus and contact line to small fluctuations . for both cases ,",
    "the @xmath142 dependence of the meniscus and contact line deterministic lies is the same .",
    "in particular , in the special case of the `` deep '' limit where @xmath143 , the asymptotic forms of our general dispersion relations are in agreement with previous works on the hele - shaw problem by paune and casademunt @xcite , ganesan and brenner @xcite and hernandez - machado _ et al .",
    "the main advantage of our method is the way it incorporates the noise into the projection , and thus allows us to study the effective noise caused to the contact line level by bulk or wall disorder .",
    "the main result of this analysis is that in both cases the effective noise is linearly proportional to the velocity of the interface .",
    "while this result qualitatively agrees with the other works cited above , quantitative differences remain in the form of the noise terms .",
    "the relevance of these differences to the actual kinetic roughening of the interfaces remains a challenging numerical problem .",

    "in this appendix we will consider in more detail the green s function of the laplacian in the fluctuating coordinate system @xmath144 which is schematically depicted in figure [ schem ] .",
    "the generalization to the two - wall setup is straightforward , but very tedious including two independent disorder functions . in particular",
    ", we will consider the correction to the green s function to linear order in small wall fluctuations @xmath80 .",

    "for the curvilinear coordinates , we need the green s function , which has the property of @xmath157 \\tilde { g}_{\\textrm { 3d } } ( \\boldsymbol { r}',\\boldsymbol { r_1 } ' ) =   - \\delta ( \\boldsymbol { r } ' - \\boldsymbol { r_1}')$ ] .",

    "this result is hardly surprising , since a simple substitution of @xmath163 to @xmath164 yields identical results to linear order .",
    "the neglected surface integrals include a reservoir term and a wall term .",
    "the reservoir term can be readily seen to be small when the meniscus is further away from the reservoir than the disorder correlation length .",
    "additionally , the reservoir boundary correction is zero when considering columnar _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath165-independent disorder .",
    "the wall term is more problematic , since it involves the boundary correction due to fluctuation in the direction of the wall normal .",
    "we have to observe the meniscus further away from the wall than the disorder correlation length in order to neglect this boundary correction .",
    "the absence of boundary disorder corrections is highly desirable if we are to keep our formalism tractable , so we have neglected the boundary corrections to the green s function ."
