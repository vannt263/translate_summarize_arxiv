    "<S> to understand how the human visual system analyzes images , it is essential to know the structure of the visual environment . in particular , natural images display consistent statistical properties that distinguish them from random luminance distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the geometric regularities of oriented elements ( edges or line segments ) present in an ensemble of visual scenes , asking how much information the presence of a segment in a particular location of the visual scene carries about the presence of a second segment at different relative positions and orientations . </S>",
    "<S> we observed strong long - range correlations in the distribution of oriented segments that extend over the whole visual field . we further show that a very simple geometric rule , _ _ cocircularity _ _ , predicts the arrangement of segments in natural scenes , and that different geometrical arrangements show relevant differences in their scaling properties . </S>",
    "<S> our results show similarities to geometric features of previous physiological and psychophysical studies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these findings for theories of early vision .    the laboratories of @xmath0mathematical physics and @xmath1neurobiology , the rockefeller university , 1230 york avenue , new york ny 10021 @xmath2present address : functional neuroimaging laboratory , dept . of psychiatry , cornell university .       </S>",
    "<S> one of the most difficult problems that the visual system has to solve is to group different elements of a scene into individual objects . despite its computational complexity , this process is normally effortless , spontaneous and unambiguous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of grouping was described by the gestalt psychologists in a series of rules summarized in the idea of good continuation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitative psychophysical measurements have shown the existence of association fields @xcite or rules that determine the interaction between neighboring oriented elements in the visual scene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on these rules and on the gestalt ideas , pairs of oriented elements that are placed in space in such a way that they extend on a smooth contour joining them will normally be grouped together .    </S>",
    "<S> these psychophysical ideas have been steadily gaining solid neurophysiological support . </S>",
    "<S> neurons in primary visual cortex ( v1 ) respond when a bar is presented at a particular location and at a specific orientation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the responses of v1 neurons are _ modulated _ by contextual interactions @xcite , such as the joint presence of contour elements within the receptive field and in its surround . </S>",
    "<S> this modulation depends upon the precise geometrical arrangement of linear elements @xcite , in a manner corresponding to the specificity of linkage of cortical columns by long - range horizontal connections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus neurons in v1 interact with one another in geometrically meaningful ways , and through these interactions , neuronal responses become selective for combinations of stimulus features that can extend far from the receptive field core .    the rules of good continuation , the association field , and the connections in primary visual cortex provide evidence of interaction of pairs of oriented elements at the psychophysical , physiological and anatomical level . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the interaction is determined by the geometry of the arrangement , including spatial arrangement and the orientation of segments within the visual scene . </S>",
    "<S> an important question is whether this geometry is related to natural geometric regularities present in the environment . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that natural images differ from random luminance distributions @xcite but the structural studies of natural scenes have not yet addressed the existence of geometrical regularities . </S>",
    "<S> here , we address this issue , by studying whether particular pairs of oriented elements are likely to co - occur in natural scenes as a function of their orientation and relative location in space . </S>",
    "<S> our results are focused on two different aspects of the organization of oriented elements in natural scenes : scaling and geometric relationships . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that these two are interdependent .    scaling measurements </S>",
    "<S> involve studying how the probability of finding a co - occurring pair changes as a function of the relative distance . </S>",
    "<S> a classic result in the analysis of natural scenes is that the luminance of pair of pixels is correlated and that this correlation is scale invariant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that statistical dependencies between pair of pixels do not depend on whether the observer zooms in on a small window or zooms out to a broad vista . </S>",
    "<S> the scale invariance results from stable physical properties such as a common source of illumination and the existence of objects of different sizes and similar reflectance properties @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that for particular geometries , the probability of finding a pair of segments follows a power law relation and thus is scale invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we show further that a very simple geometric rule , consistent with the idea of good continuation , predicts the arrangement of segments in natural scenes .      </S>",
    "<S> images were obtained from a publicly available database ( _ http://hlab.phys.rug.nl/imlib/index.html _ ) @xcite of about 4000 uncompressed black and white pictures , 1536x1024 pixels in size and 12 bits in depth , with an angular resolution of ~1 minute of arc per pixel . </S>",
    "<S> this particular database was chosen because of the high quality of its pictures , especially the lack of motion and compression artifacts , which would otherwise overwhelm our statistics . to obtain a measure of local orientation we used the steerable filters of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 basis @xcite . using steerable filters , </S>",
    "<S> the energy value at any orientation can be calculated by extrapolating the responses of a set of basis filters . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath4 filter is a second derivative of a gaussian and the @xmath3 filter is its hilbert transform . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 and @xmath4 filters have the same amplitude spectra , but they are @xmath5 out of phase ; that makes them a quadrature pair basis filters . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the filters used was 7x7 pixels . </S>",
    "<S> a measure of oriented energy was obtained by combining both sets of filters @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this measure is repeated at every pixel of the image to obtain the energy function for each image ( _ n _ ) of the ensemble @xmath7 . to study the joint statistics of @xmath8 , we discretized the different orientations at 16 different values , @xmath9 as shown in the color representation of orientations of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . with this information </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain a measure of the statistics of pairs of segments by calculating the correlation ( weighting the co - occurrences of segments by their energy ) @xmath10    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 where _ n _ is the total number of images and the integral is over each of the images of the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we were interested in measuring long - range correlations so we studied values of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation matrix has dimensions 512x512x16x16 and each point results from averaging 4000 integrals over a 1536x1024 domain . to simplify the computations , for the general case </S>",
    "<S> , we decided to store at each pixel , for every image , the maximum energy value @xmath13 and its corresponding orientation @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> an energy threshold @xmath15 was arbitrarily set to match the visual perception of edges in a few images . </S>",
    "<S> pixels in an image were considered `` oriented '' if @xmath16 , `` non - oriented '' otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> this unique threshold value was applied to all images in the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for each image , we extracted a binary field @xmath17 and an orientation field @xmath18 . from this binary field </S>",
    "<S> we can construct a histogram of co - occurrences : how many times an element at postion _ ( x , y ) _ was considered oriented with orientation @xmath19 and at position @xmath20 a segment was considered oriented with orientation @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , formally , the histogram is obtained as @xmath22 , taking as the energy function @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; @xmath26 in any other case . </S>",
    "<S> the computation is reduced to counting the co - occurrences in the histogram @xmath27 with @xmath28 . from the histogram we obtained a measure of statistical dependence . while choosing the threshold followed computational reasons , cortical neurons perform a thresholding operation and thus the measure of linear correlation ( weighting co - occurrences by their energy ) is not necessarily a more accurate measure of statistical dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram was used for all the data shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , 2b and 2c , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , fig . 4 , and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . for fig . 2d , for the particular case of collinear interactions we computed the full linear cross - correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this computation is considerably easier since it is done for fixed values of orientation and direction in space . </S>",
    "<S> the two measures shown ( laplacian correlation and collinear correlation ) were obtained according to the formulas : @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31 for laplacian filtering , and @xmath32 for collinear oriented filtering .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative signature of scale invariance is given by a function of the form @xmath33 ( power law ) where _ c _ is the correlation , _ r _ the distance and _ a _ constant . </S>",
    "<S> if the scale is changed @xmath34 the function changes as @xmath35 where _ k _ is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> a power law is easily identified as a linear plot in the log - log graph , which is clear from the relation @xmath36 .    the axis of maximal correlation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b ) was calculated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> for each pair of orientations @xmath37 , a measure of co - occurrence was calculated integrating across 16 different lines of angles of values @xmath38 over distances of [ -40,40 ] of the center of the histogram . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for an angle @xmath39 and orientations @xmath37 the measure of co - occurrence is : @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculated the direction of maximal correlation @xmath41 and we grouped all angles with common relative orientation , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we had 16 different values for each @xmath43 and from these 16 different values we calculated the mean @xmath44 and the standard error . to calculate the mean energy as a function of relative orientation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) we integrated the histogram in spatial coordinates for each pair of orientations in space , and , as before , the different pairs where grouped according to their relative difference in orientation to calculate a mean value and a standard deviation , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the code was parallelized using mpi libraries and run over a small beowulf cluster of linux workstations .    in general , horizontal and vertical directions had better statistics since there are more horizontal or vertical segments than oblique in the images ; these special orientations are also the ones most prone to artifacts from aliasing , staircasing , and the ensemble choice . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in this study in the correlations as a function of relative distance and orientations , all the quantitative measurments were performed averaging over all orientations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results shown still held true for each individual orientation .      </S>",
    "<S> all 4000 images used in this study were black and white , 1536x1024 pixels in size and 12 bits in depth . </S>",
    "<S> we used a set of filters to obtain a measure of orientation at each pixel of every image of the database @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the filters were 7x7 pixels in size and thus provided a local measure of orientation . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the filter was high at pixels where contrast changed abruptly in a particular direction , typically by the presence of line segments or edges , but also corners , junctions or other singularities ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . if the output of the filters were statistically independent then we would expect a flat correlation as a function of @xmath47 . in polar </S>",
    "<S> coordinates @xmath48 , the two problems which we address are naturally separated : the scaling properties result from studying how the histogram depends on _ r _ ( distance ) whereas the geometry does it from the dependence of the histogram on @xmath39 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> we studied the number of co - occurring pairs of segments as a function of their relative distance for different geometries ( fig 2a , b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the different geometric configurations correspond to the different orientations of the segments and their relative position within an image . </S>",
    "<S> we first studied the number of co - occurrences as a function of distance in the line spanned by the orientation of the reference segment , averaged across all possible orientations of the reference line ( fig 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> when both segments have the same orientation we observe a scale invariant behavior , indicated by a linear relationship in the log - log plot ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> also it can be seen from this plot that collinear co - occurrences are more frequent than any other configuration . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b shows the probability of co - occurrences is higher for the vertical orientation , and scale invariance extends over a broader range .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling properties are qualitatively different for segments positioned side - by - side , along a line orthogonal to the orientation of the first segment ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> iso - oriented pairs were again the most frequent , but their co - occurrence in the orthogonal direction to the orientation of the first segment ( fig 2c , black line ) does not appear to be scale invariant . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected by the presence of a kink as opposed to a straight line ( power law ) in the log - log plot , indicating well - defined scales with different behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth comparing the scale of interactions one observes by using different kinds of filters . before filtering images </S>",
    "<S> , the luminance shows correlations , which follows a power law behavior @xcite . after applying a laplacian filter ( equivalent to a center - surround operator , which measures non - oriented local contrast ) , the image is mostly decorrelated ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d , red circles ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in the exponential decay of the correlations , and the fact that the correlations show similar behavior after a pixel - by - pixel shuffling of the image ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d , cyan circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strength and scaling of the correlations across the collinear line changes radically when one uses an oriented filter . in this example , to make a direct comparison between the various filters , we weighted each pair of segments by their energy value ( linear cross - correlation , instead of applying a threshold as was done in the earlier calculations ) . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation was done for the vertical reference line orientation , which showed long - range correlations ( fig . 2b , black circles ) , over much longer distances than observed with the laplacian filter . moreover , these correlations were not present when measured in the shuffled images ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , green circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the above analysis that when one uses oriented filters one reveals strong correlations extending over large distances . </S>",
    "<S> the next question is how these correlations depend on the relative orientation of the line elements , and whether these dependencies have any underlying geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we first calculated the total number of co - occurrences as a function of the relative difference in orientation . </S>",
    "<S> co - occurrences decreased as the relative orientation between the pair of segments increased , being maximal when they were iso - oriented and minimal when they were perpendicular ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) .    the next observation concerns spatial structure . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of finding co - occurring pair of segments was not uniform but rather displayed a consistent geometric structure . if the two segments were iso - oriented , their most probable spatial arrangement was as part of a common line , the collinear configuration ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) . as the relative difference in orientation between the two segments increased , two effects were observed . the main lobe of the histogram ( which in the iso - oriented case extends in the collinear direction ) rotated and shortened , and a second lobe ( where co - occurrences were also maximized ) appeared at @xmath5 from the first ( fig 4a - e ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect progressed smoothly until the relative orientation of the two segments was @xmath5 , where the two lobes were arranged in a symmetrical configuration , lying at @xmath49 relative to the reference orientation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , pairs of oriented segments have significant statistical correlations in natural scenes , and both the average probability and spatial layout depend strongly upon their relative orientation . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the structure of the correlations followed a very simple geometric rule . </S>",
    "<S> a natural extension of collinearity to the plane is cocircularity . </S>",
    "<S> while two segments of different orientations can not belong to the same straight line , they may still be tangent to the same circle if they are tilted at identical but opposite angles to the line joining them . given a pair of segments tilted at angles @xmath21 and @xmath19 respectively , they should lie along two possible lines , at angles @xmath50 or @xmath51 , in order to be cocircular ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the arrangement we observed in natural scenes . </S>",
    "<S> the measured correlations , given any relative orientation of edges , were maximal when arranged along a common circle . to quantify this we calculated the orientation of the axis where co - occurrences were maximal . </S>",
    "<S> we did that for different relative orientations and compared it to the value predicted by the cocircularity rule ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly remarkable because the comparison is not a fit , since the cocircularity rule has no free parameters .      </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that there are strong , long - range correlations between local oriented segments in natural scenes , that their scaling properties change for different geometries , and that their arrangement obeys the cocircularity rule . </S>",
    "<S> the filters we used for edge detection in our images were an oriented version of laplacian - like filters , in that they were local but had elongated , rather than circularly symmetric , center - surround structures . </S>",
    "<S> this change is analogous to the difference between filters in the lgn and simple cells in the primary visual cortex . </S>",
    "<S> thus , given that laplacian filtering decorrelates natural scenes @xcite , it was surprising to find the long - range correlations and scale invariant behavior of the collinear configuration . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remark that our measure of correlation does not differ only on the type of filters used ( elongated vs. circular symmetric ) but also on the fact that we measured the correlations along a line containing the pair of segments . </S>",
    "<S> long contours are part of the output of the laplacian filters and thus the image should show correlations which might be hidden when integrating them across an area , essentially because a curve has zero area and thus the correlations along a curve are not significant when integrated over the two - dimensional field of view . the findings of long - range correlations of oriented elements extends the notion that the output of linear local oriented filtering of natural scenes can not be statistically independent @xcite and shows that those correlations might be very significant through global portions of the visual field for particular geometries .    the cocircular rule has been used heuristically to establish a pattern of interactions between filters in computer vision @xcite , and psychophysical studies suggest that the human visual system utilizes a local grouping process , `` association field '' , with a similar geometric pattern @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our finding provides an underlying statistical principle for the establishment of form and for the gestalt idea of good continuation , which states that there are preferred linkages endowing some contours with the property of perceptual saliency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important portion of the classical euclidean geometry has been constructed using the two simplest planar curves , the line and the circle @xcite ; here we show that those are , in the same order , the most significant structures in natural scenes .    we have reported the emergence of robust geometric and scaling properties of natural scenes . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of the underlying physical processes that generate these regularities . </S>",
    "<S> while our work was solely based on statistical analysis , we can speculate on the possible constraints imposed by the physical world . in a simplyfing view </S>",
    "<S> , we can think of a natural image as composed by object boundaries or contours , and textures . </S>",
    "<S> collineal pairs of segments are likely to belong to a common contour ; thus , our finding of scale invariance for collineal correlations is in agreement with the idea that scale - invariance in natural images is a consequence of the distribution of apparent sizes of objects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> parallel segments , on the contrary , may be part of a common contour as well as a common texture , which would explain the two scaling regimes we observed . </S>",
    "<S> cocircularity in natural scenes probably arises due to the continuity and smoothness of object boundaries ; when averaged over objects of vastly different sizes present in any natural scene , the most probable arrangement for two edge segments is to lie on the smoothest curve joining them , a circular arc . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas , however , requiere an investigation which is beyond the scope of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the pattern of interactions in primary visual cortex parallels the interactions of oriented segments in natural scenes . </S>",
    "<S> long - range interactions tend to connect iso - oriented segments @xcite and interactions between orthogonal segments , which span a short range in natural scenes , may be mediated by short - range connections spanning singularities in the orientation and topographic maps in the primary visual cortex @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finding of a correspondence between the interaction characteristics of neurons in visual cortex and the regularities of natural scenes suggests a possible role for cortical plasticity early in life , in order for the cortex to assimilate and represent these regularities . </S>",
    "<S> this plasticity might be mediated by hebbian - like processes , reinforcing connections on neurons whose activity coincide , i.e. , their corresponding stimuli are correlated under natural visual stimulation . </S>",
    "<S> such plasticity could extend to adulthood to accommodate perceptual learning of novel and particular forms @xcite .    while we find coincidences between the pattern of interactions in v1 and the distribution of segments in natural scenes </S>",
    "<S> , the sign of the interactions plays a crucial role . reinforcing or facilitation of co - occurring stimuli ( positive interaction ) results in hebbian - like coincidence detectors , while inhibiting the response results in barlow - like detectors of `` suspicious coincidences '' which ignore frequent co - occurrences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly the hebbian idea and the decorrelation hypothesis represent two sides of the same coin . from our measurements of the regularities in natural scenes , and previous studies on the higher order receptive field properties in primary visual cortex , it appears that both type of operations exist . </S>",
    "<S> the response of a cell in v1 is typically inhibited when a second flanking segment is placed outside of its receptive field along an axis orthogonal to the receptive field orientation . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is referred as side - inhibition , which is strongest when the flanking segment has the same orientation as the segment inside the receptive field @xcite . in the present study we found that iso - orientation is the most probable arrangement for side - by - side segments in natural scenes , which therefore constitutes an example , in the domain of orientation , of decorrelation through inhibition . </S>",
    "<S> this inhibition may mediate the process of texture discrimination @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the property of end - inhibition has also been interpreted as a mechanism to remove redundancies and achieve statistical independence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finding that responses of v1 neurons are sparse when presented with natural stimuli @xcite and models of normalization of neuronal responses in v1 tuned to the statistics of natural scenes @xcite also support the idea that the interactions in v1 play an important role in decorrelating the output from v1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the general idea that one of the important functions of early visual processing is to remove redundant information @xcite and suggests that interactions in v1 may continue with the process of decorrelation which is achieved by laplacian @xcite and local oriented filtering @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> but the visual cortex also can act in the opposite way , reinforcing the response to the most probable configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in the collinear configuration , which is the one that elicits most facilitation , and therefore illustrates how v1 can enhance the regularities in natural scenes . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that those correlations are significant over the entire visual field and are highly structured suggests that this is not a residual , or second - order process . </S>",
    "<S> the opposing processes of enhancement of correlations and decorrelation may be mediated by different receptive field properties , which can exist within the same cell . </S>",
    "<S> the same flank can inhibit or facilitate depending on the contrast @xcite suggesting that v1 may be solving different computational problems at different contrast ranges or different noise - to - signal relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the dialectic behavior of visual cortex shows that the interplay between decorrelation ( extraction of suspicious coincidences ) and enhancement of particular set of regularities ( identification of form ) may be mediated by the same population of neurons . while the decorrelating process may be required to operate in the orientation domain to solve the problem of texture segmentation , particular sets of coincidences , which are repeated in the statistics , such as the conjunction of segments that form contours , need to be enhanced in the process of identification of form .      </S>",
