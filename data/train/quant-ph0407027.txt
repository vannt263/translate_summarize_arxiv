    "a quantum bit ( qubit ) is a quantum system with two levels which will be a cell for storing and processing information in a future quantum computer .",
    "so it is a vital task to find out the physical realizations of the qubits . in last years",
    ", physicists have proposed several qubit models which are based on ion traps @xcite , qed systems @xcite , nuclear spins of large numbers of identical molecules @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , josephson junction @xcite and so on . because solid state qubits can be embedded in electronic circuits as well as scaled up to a large numbers , they are taken as a particularly promising candidates promising of qubits for quantum computation .",
    "the josephson junction qubit is one of this kinds of models .",
    "decoherence , one of the most difficult problems to be dealt with in quantum computation exists in all of the qubit models . in general",
    ", decoherence comes from the interaction of the qubits and their environment .",
    "but for some qubit models , for example , quantum dots and josephson junctions , the decoherence also results from intrinsic source of error , such as quantum leakage leakage01 @xcite .",
    "the quantum leakage is this kind of process that the system working in the computational hilbert space leaks out to higher states .",
    "the leakage exists in many quantum processes @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is attracted a particular attention in the implementations of qubits and quantum gates for quantum computation @xcite because they must satisfy the divincenzo s checklist five criteria @xcite one of which is low decoherence ( so that error correction techniques may be used in a fault - tolerant manner)an approximate benchmark is the loss of fidelity no more than @xmath1 per elementary quantum gate operation .    in @xcite ,",
    "et al_. investigated the leakage and fidelity of the josephson charge qubit ( jcq ) operations . where the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the jcq hamiltonian are obtained through diagonalizing the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , they can be obtained in virtue of the perturbation theory of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in particular , as pointed in @xcite the eigenvalues and eigenstates can be obtained by solving the eigen - equation of the jcq hamiltonian which in fact is the mathieu equation @xcite . the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the jcq",
    "hamiltonian correspond to the characteristic values and characteristic states of the mathieu equation . in this paper",
    "we will use the well researched mathieu functions investigating the loss of fidelity for the single jcq .",
    "the single jcq was first introduced by shnirman",
    "_ et al . _",
    "since then , much interest has been attracted into this topic .",
    "the simplest jcq can be designed as fig.1 ( refer to fig.1 of ref . promising ) . ignoring the resistance in the circuit , from the josephson relations@xmath6and the current conservation we have @xmath7where @xmath8 is the critical current of the josephson junction , @xmath9 is a magnetic flux quantum , @xmath10 is the gauge invariant phase of the superconducting junction , @xmath11 is the voltage of the josephson junction and @xmath12 is the gate voltage . due to @xmath13 , eq.([e2 ] ) can be written as@xmath14where @xmath15 thus , we can obtain the lagrangian of the jcq as @xmath16the euler - lagrange equation can be used to check that the lagrangian produces the correct classical equations of motion,@xmath17by definition , the conjugate variable to @xmath10 is,@xmath18on the other hand , the charge on the josephson junction capacitance and the gate capacitance are @xmath19where @xmath20 is the cooper pairs pass through the josephson junction , and @xmath21 is the number of two - unit charge @xmath22 on the gate capacitance . from eqs.([e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) we have @xmath23so @xmath24now we can construct the hamiltonian via legendre transformation , @xmath25setting @xmath26 @xmath27 we have@xmath28so we have @xmath29 = -i\\hbar , $ ] and @xmath30 = -i\\hbar \\pi /\\phi _ { 0}e.$ ] as ref .",

    "the mathieu functions were introduced by mathieu @xcite when analyzing the movements of membranes of elliptical shape . since",
    "then the characters of the mathieu functions have been investigated by mathieu and others mathieufun . in recent years , the functions",
    "have been attracted much attention because they have some applications in many fields of physics mathieu02 .",
    "the mathieu equation has the well known periodic solutions@xmath47it has been pointed that the periodic boundary conditions @xmath48 singles out only the @xmath49 periodic mathieu eigenfunctions @xmath50 for an integer @xmath51 and the @xmath52-anti - periodic mathieu eigenfunctions @xmath53",

    "the difference derives from the quantum leakage . in the following",
    ", we shall investigate the loss of fidelity due to the quantum leakage for the jcq .",
    "the leakage of the jcq is in fact the probability of initial state @xmath81 leaks out to higher states after some time in the practical system .",
    "it can be defined as@xmath82where @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 are project operators@xmath87 @xmath79 is the finally state .",
    "the loss of fidelity is the probability by measuring the state @xmath88 with the project operators but @xmath89 and @xmath90 by use of eq.([e20 ] ) we have@xmath91because of@xmath92we have@xmath93on the other hand , in general , the fidelity is defined as @xmath94 for two arbitrary states @xmath95 and @xmath96 and @xmath97 for two pure states @xmath98 and @xmath99 nielson - chuang@xmath5 by using @xmath100 and @xmath88 we can straightforwardly calculate the loss of fidelity , it is also@xmath101it means that if we do not consider the interaction of the qubit and the environment , the loss of fidelity is just the quantum leakage @xmath102 .",
    "so the relation of the fidelity and leakage is @xmath103    for present typical parameters of josephson junction @xmath104 @xcite@xmath105 we can obtain the fidelity @xmath106 ( calculated by using our formula)@xmath105 which is agreement with @xmath107 ( calculated by using the eq.(7 ) of ref.@xcite ) very well .",
    "it can be easily seen that the loss of fidelity due to the leakage will be decreased by an appropriate choice of the device parameters .",
    "for example , the fidelity will increase to @xmath108 for @xmath109 and to @xmath110 for @xmath111 which shows that the loss of the fidelity is about @xmath112 per elementary gate operation as @xmath113 . according to divincenzo s low decoherence criterion",
    "the loss of fidelity is tolerable . from the subsection ii we know @xmath114 @xmath115 ,",
    "and we use units where @xmath31 @xmath32 so @xmath116 in the units .",
    "ttherefore @xmath117 @xmath118 . to decrease @xmath2",
    "one should decrease the critical current @xmath8 or the total capacitance @xmath119 .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite we investigate the short - time decoherence of the jcq , where the increasing of the critical current @xmath8 and the decreasing of the total capacitance @xmath119 are needed for decreasing the decoherence derived from the interaction of the system and its environment . from the analysis of the two papers we know that to decrease the decoherence not only from quantum leakage but from the environment one may improve the design of the jcq through increasing the critical current @xmath120 and decreasing the total capacitance @xmath119 . but the design should keep @xmath121",
    "in this paper we investigated the loss of fidelity due to the quantum leakage for jcq .",
    "our researches are based on a lot of results of mathieu functions .",
    "it is shown that our results agree with previous corresponding investigations very well .",
    "however , our work can expand to higher order approximation easily because of the well researched mathieu functions .",
    "in particular , our results provide a feedback on how to improve the design of the jcq for quantum computation .",
    "it is shown that decreasing the critical current and decreasing the josephson capacitance and gate capacitance can decrease the decoherence from the quantum leakage . however , in order to decrease the total decoherence one may improve the design by increasing the critical current @xmath8 and decreasing the total capacitance @xmath119 .",
    "but the design should keep @xmath122 so we think that it is necessary to develop the technology of increasing the josephson critical current and decreasing the capacitances in the small josephson junctions in order to make the jcq suitable for quantum computation .",
