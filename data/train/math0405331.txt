    "the goal of the paper is to intiate an approach to the hyperbolic volume conjecture , via asymptotics of solutions of difference equations with a small parameter .",
    "the generalized volume conjecture links ( conjecturally ) the ( colored ) jones polynomial of a knot to hyperbolic geometry of its complement .",
    "since the colored jones polynomial is a specific solution to a linear @xmath0-difference equation , it follows that the generalized volume conjecture is the wkb limit of a specific solution of a linear difference equation with a small parameter .    motivated by this",
    ", we study wkb asymptotics of formal and actual solutions of difference equations with a small parameter , under certain regularity asymptions .      a knot in 3-space is a smooth embedding of a circle , considered up to isotopy .",
    "two of the simplest knots , the trefoil ( @xmath1 ) and the figure eight ( @xmath2 ) are shown here : @xmath3    by the very definition , knots are flexible objects defined up to isotopy , which allows the embedding to move in a smooth and arbitrary way as long as it does not cross itself . in algebraic topology , a common way of studying knots ( and more generally , spaces ) is to associate computable numerical invariants ( such as euler characteristic , or homology ) .",
    "invariants are useful in deciding whether two knots are not the same .",
    "it is a much harder problem to construct computable invariants that separate knots .",
    "the invariant that we will consider in this paper is the jones polynomial of a knot ; @xcite , which is a laurent polynomial with integer coefficients , associated to each knot . the quantum nature of the jones polynomial is apparent both in the original definition of jones ( using temperley - lieb algebras ) and in the reformulation , due to witten , in terms of the expectation value of a quantum field theory ; see @xcite .",
    "the combinatorics associated to a planar projection of a knot show that the jones polynomial is a computable invariant .",
    "however , it is hard to see from this point of view the relation between the jones polynomial and geometry . in quantum field theory ,",
    "one often reproduces geometry by moving carefully chosen parameters of the theory to an appropriate limit .    in our case",
    ", we will introduce a new parameter , a natural number which roughly speaking corresponds to taking a connected @xmath4-parallel of a knot .",
    "the resulting invariant is no longer a laurent polynomial , but rather a sequence of laurent polynomials .",
    "the _ colored jones function _ of a knot @xmath5 in 3-space is a sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath6.\\ ] ] the first term in the above sequence , @xmath7 is the jones polynomial of @xmath5 ; see @xcite .",
    "although knots are flexible objects , thurston had the idea that their complements have a unique decomposition in pieces of unique `` crystaline '' shape .",
    "the shapes in question are the @xmath8 different geometries in dimension @xmath9 , and the idea in question was termed the `` geometrization conjecture '' .",
    "the most common of the @xmath8 geometries is hyperbolic geometry , that is the existence of a complete , finite volume , constant curvature @xmath10 riemannian metric on knot complements .",
    "thurston proved that unless the knot is torus or a satellite , then it carries a unique such metric ; see @xcite .    the _ hyperbolic volume conjecture _",
    "( hvc , in short ) connects two very different views of knot : namely quantum field theory and riemannian geometry .",
    "the hvc states for every hyperbolic knot @xmath5 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ volume _ of a complete hyperbolic metric in the knot complement @xmath13 . the conjecture was formulated in this form by murakami - murakami @xcite following an earlier version due to kashaev , @xcite .",
    "more generally , gukov ( see @xcite ) formulated a generalized hyperbolic volume conjecture that identifies the limit @xmath14 of a hyperbolic knot with known hyperbolic invariants ( such as the volume of cone manifolds obtained by hyperbolic dehn filling ) , for @xmath15-\\bq$ ] or @xmath16 .",
    "actually , the ghvc is stated for _ complex _",
    "numbers @xmath17 . for simplicity",
    ", we will study asympotics for real @xmath18 $ ] .    at present",
    ", it is not known whether the limit in the hvc exists , let alone that it can be computed .",
    "explicit finite multisum formulas for the colored jones function of a knot exist ; see for example @xcite . from these formulas alone , it is difficult to study the above limit . in a sense , the question is to understand the sequence of laurent polynomials that appears in the hvc . if the sequence is in some sense random , then it is hard to expect that the limit exists , or that it can be computed .    since the first term of this sequence is the jones polynomial , and",
    "since we know little about the possible values of the jones polynomial , one would expect that there is even less to be said about the colored jones function .",
    "luckily , the colored jones function behaves in a better way than its first term , namely the jones polynomial .",
    "this can be quantified by recent work of ttq le and the first author , who proved that the colored jones function of a knot satisfies a @xmath0-difference equation .    in other words , for every knot @xmath5 there exist rational functions @xmath19 ( which of course depend on @xmath5 ) such that for all @xmath20 we have : @xmath21    this opens the possibility of studying the @xmath0-difference equation rather than one of its solutions , namely the colored jones function .",
    "although the @xmath0-difference equation is not unique , it was shown by the first author in @xcite that one can choose a unique @xmath0-difference equation , which is a knot invariant .",
    "moreover , it was conjectured in @xcite that the characteristic polynomial of this @xmath0-difference equation determines the characters of @xmath22 representations of the knot complement , viewed from the boundary .",
    "as was explained by the first author on several occasions , asymptotics of solutions of @xmath0-difference equations would have consequences on the hvc .    in this introductory article",
    "we review the history of asymptotics of solutions of @xmath0-difference equations .",
    "excellent references for differential equations with a parameter are olver s and wasau s books ; @xcite and @xcite . in 1837 ,",
    "liouville and green independently studied systematically existence of formal ( i.e. , perturbative ) and actual solutions for second order differential equations with a parameter ; see @xcite .",
    "second order equations are very important for classical and quantum physics .    in 1908",
    "birkhoff had the insight to introduce and study _ arbitrary _ order differential equation with a parameter ( see @xcite ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 means @xmath4-th derivative with respect to @xmath26 ( assumed to be restricted to a real interval ) , and @xmath27 is a large complex parameter , and where the coefficient @xmath28 are complex @xmath29 functions with an expansion @xmath30 birkhoff s working assumption was that the eigenvalues @xmath31 of the characteristic equation @xmath32 were distinct but not necessarily nowhere vanishing .    in 1926 ,",
    "three theoretical physicists , wentzel - krammer - brillouin studied the second order differential equation under the assumption that its eigenvalues do not collide , and developed connection formulas linking solutions in the exponential region with those in the oscillatory region . their method is often referred to as the wkb method .      as a motivation for our results ,",
    "let us recall some fundamental results of birkhoff and trjitzinsky from 1930 on difference equations without a parameter ; see @xcite and @xcite .    a _ difference equation _ for a discrete function @xmath33 has the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are discrete functions so that @xmath36 for all @xmath20 .",
    "we will assume the existence of asymptotic expansions of @xmath37 around @xmath38 for all @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "this certainly holds for @xmath42 if @xmath43 are rational functions of @xmath4 , as is often the case in combinatorial problems .    due to the nowhere vanishing of @xmath44",
    ", it follows that the set of solutions of is a vector space of dimension @xmath45 .",
    "there are two main problems of difference equations :    * existence of _ formal series solutions _",
    "@xmath46 to . *",
    "existence of a basis @xmath47 of solutions so that @xmath48 is asymptotic to @xmath49 for large @xmath4 .    in @xcite",
    ", birkhoff solved the existence of formal solutions in complete generality ( that is , without any assumptions on the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation ) . in a sequel paper @xcite ,",
    "birkhoff - trjitzinsky solved the second problem in complete generality .    among other things ,",
    "the formal solutions of birkhoff lead to the development of differential galois theory , see @xcite .",
    "decades later , the results of birkhoff and trjitzinsky on difference equations have found applications to enumerative combinatorics and numerical analysis ; see for example wimp and zeilberger in @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is not surprising that difference equations are used in numerical analysis , since difference equations are numerical schemes of approximating differential equations . in enumerative combinatorics and complexity",
    "theory , difference equations appear in recursive computation .",
    "for example , the number @xmath50 of involutions of @xmath51 ( that is , permutations which are a product of 1 and 2-cycles ) is given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "using the results of birkhoff - trjitzinsky and the fact that @xmath50 is monotone , it follows that @xmath55 for nonzero constants @xmath56 and some @xmath57 .",
    "actually , the @xmath58 can be computed recursively from the difference equation ; see @xcite .      by some historical accident , asymptotics of solutions of difference equations with a parameter",
    "was not discussed a century ago .",
    "the first paper that discusses second order difference equation with a parameter appears to be due to deift - mclaughlin ( see @xcite ) which was generalized by costin - costin to arbitrary order difference equations , @xcite .",
    "the purpose in this paper is to show that for regular @xmath0-difference equations , a regular solution has a well - defined and computable exponential growth rate in terms of a relative entropy of the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath0-difference equation ; see theorem [ thm.1 ] below .",
    "this subject is classical and has been reinvented over the past hundred years by several groups , often unaware of each others results . in a sense ,",
    "the problem of formal solutions of @xmath0-difference equations is a problem in differential galois theory ; @xcite , and a problem in numerical analysis ; see for example @xcite .    our results are hardly new and are contained or can be obtained by minor modifications from results of costin - costin or from work of birkhoff and collaborators , @xcite .",
    "since the presentation in the above papers varies by time and taste , we have decided to give a self - contained account of the theory with complete proofs .",
    "hopefully , this will benefit the researchers in quantum topology and in analysis .      in this paper",
    ", we will describe asymptotics of solutions of @xmath0-difference equations .    a _ @xmath0-difference equation _ for a sequence @xmath59 of smooth functions of @xmath0 has the form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are smooth functions and @xmath62 .",
    "before we proceed further , let us remark that @xmath0 is a _",

    ", @xmath0 is a complex number inside or outside the unit disk .",

    "<S> in particular , evaluations of regular solutions of regular @xmath0-difference equations have an exponential growth rate which can be computed from the @xmath0-difference equation .    </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for the paper comes from a problem in quantum topology , the hyperbolic volume conjecture , which states that a sequence on laurent polynomials ( the so - called colored jones function of a knot ) , appropriately evaluated , becomes a sequence of complex numbers that grows exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the exponential growth rate is proportional to the volume of the knot complement .    </S>",
    "<S> the connection of the hyperbolic volume conjecture with the paper comes from the fact that the colored jones function of a knot is a solution of a @xmath0-difference equation , as was proven by ttq . </S>",
