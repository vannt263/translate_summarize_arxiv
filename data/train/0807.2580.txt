    "ever since the experiments of osborne reynolds in 1883,@xcite it has been known that the flow of a newtonian fluid in a circular pipe undergoes an abrupt transition from a laminar to a turbulent state . this transition is governed by one dimensionless parameter , the reynolds number @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the bulk velocity , @xmath2 the pipe diameter and @xmath3 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ) . transition is usually observed experimentally for @xmath4 but can be delayed to larger values in especially well - controlled experiments.@xcite the laminar state ( hagen - poiseuille flow ) is believed linearly stable for all @xmath5 , so that transition to turbulence can not be explained by an ordered sequence of bifurcations starting from the basic state .",
    "instead , pipe flow belongs to a more general class of parallel shear flows , including plane couette and plane poiseuille flow , which undergo finite - amplitude instability.@xcite the transitional dynamics of these flows then appears organised around the presence of other solutions disconnected from the laminar state.@xcite such new solutions are expected to have a relatively simple structure compared to the turbulent dynamics and to be unstable .",
    "these expectations are conceptually satisfying for two reasons .",
    "firstly , relatively simple three - dimensional mechanisms ( e.g. the ` self - sustaining process ' ) have been identified in low-@xmath5 flows@xcite allowing turbulence to be sustained over long times , which evokes the possibility of organised dynamics .",
    "secondly , instability is needed to rationalise why neither steady nor periodic exact states are ever found as limiting states to emerge from an initially turbulent flow .",
    "the fact that statistically recurrent states have been clearly observed , e.g. streaky velocity fields with an intrinsic wavelength in most wall - bounded shear flows,@xcite is most easily explained by imagining repeated visits in phase space to the vicinity of exact solutions of the governing equations .",
    "progress in numerical computation has first led to the discovery of some exact solutions in plane shear flows @xcite and more recently pipe flow.@xcite they are all equilibria ( steady states ) or relative equilibria ( travelling waves which are steady in a moving frame ) and all possess a small number of unstable eigendirections .",
    "they appear through saddle - node bifurcations and are disconnected from the laminar state .",
    "there is a tremendous interest in these solutions as very similar structures have been observed transiently in experiments.@xcite it is worth emphasizing that their simple dynamics ( steadiness or constant speed propagation ) is inherent to the method used to seek them , and undoubtedly hides a larger variety of other solutions . at some point",
    "the physical description of the flow in terms of three - dimensional structures ceases to be enlightening and it is useful to think in terms of a trajectory in phase space . formally , the navier - stokes equations can be projected onto any infinite - dimensional basis of incompressible velocity fields to yield an autonomous dynamical system of the form @xmath6 .",
    "the choice of the basis , and hence the particular projection , is not crucial .",
    "the topology of the phase space associated to pipe flow near transition is thought to be organised around one locally attractive point ( the ` laminar ' flow ) and a chaotic saddle , i.e. a set of unstable solutions and their heteroclinic and homoclinic connections.@xcite from this point of view , it is necessary to know which states the saddle is made of in order to understand the dynamics near transition .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the unstable solutions known so far in pipe flow , the travelling waves ( tws ) , are visited only for about @xmath7-@xmath8 of the time.@xcite this indicates that , provided the picture is correct , more solutions of a different type have to be sought . the next level up in the hierarchy of solutions from relative",
    "equilibria is relative periodic orbits ( rpos ) .",
    "they are an extension of periodic orbits ( in the same way as traveling waves correspond to degenerate fixed points ) due to the invariance of the equations with respect to the azimuthal and axial directions .",
    "physically , a rpo corresponds to a flow which repeats itself periodically in a given moving frame , translating and/or rotating along the pipe axis at a constant rate . in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath9 aligned with the pipe axis ,",
    "it is a time - dependent velocity field @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 for some constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the initial motivation behind the search for periodic behaviour is periodic orbit theory,@xcite which states that any dynamical average of a smooth chaotic dynamical system can be evaluated in a deterministic way by finding all unstable periodic orbits of the system up to a certain period , and carefully averaging over them .",
    "consideration of continuous symmetries in the original pdes - here translation in @xmath15 and rotation in @xmath16 - extends this expansion over all _ relative _ periodic orbits.@xcite even if complete knowledge of _ all _ periodic orbits of the system seems computationally ambitious today , a start needs to be made in developing numerical tools to find them in anticipation of greater computing power tomorrow .",
    "some progress has already been made in plane couette flow with the recent discovery of periodic@xcite and relative periodic orbits@xcite embedded in turbulence , albeit in small flow domains . beyond the obvious computational savings ,",
    "restricting the largest wavelength in the flow has proved a very useful tool for isolating key dynamics @xcite . in the same spirit , we will here concentrate on relatively short ` periodic ' pipes only a few diameters long .    in this study",
    "we are interested in rpos which are located in the laminar - turbulent boundary , the invariant subset of phase - space on which trajectories neither relaminarise nor become turbulent .",
    "states belonging to this subset can be visited transiently by phase - space trajectories during the transition process .",
    "phase - space trajectories constrained to remain precisely on this laminar - turbulent boundary have been found to approach a chaotic attractor @xcite centered on one particular tw solution , the ` asymmetric tw ' found by pringle & kerswell.@xcite the importance of this particular tw has been confirmed by further calculations which show that trajectories constrained to lie on this laminar - turbulent boundary recurrently approach this tw .",
    "@xcite we therefore concentrate on looking for rpos which bifurcate from this asymmetric tw .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : computing ] explains in detail the numerical method chosen to find rpos from a starting guess and section iii describes the new branch of rpos found .",
    "subsection [ sec : heteroc ] confirms that the rpo is on the laminar - turbulent boundary and then explores the likelihood of connections between the rpo and other tws .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] discusses the relevance of the rpo to the transition process as well as the numerical limitations of the method .",

    "we confine our calculations to a pipe of length @xmath42 radii @xmath43 .",
    "this length has been chosen because it is a wavelength for which the asymmetric tw@xcite is known to be on the laminar - turbulent boundary and for which most data were already available .",

    "a value of the period @xmath52 has to be chosen to uniquely define @xmath53 .",
    "we choose @xmath12 as the time minimising the @xmath54dependent scalar function @xmath55 over a given time interval .",
    "this is done by accurate interpolation of the zeros of its derivative , the scalar function @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ upo ] shows schematically that the time @xmath52 is picked up along the trajectory when its tangent vector is orthogonal to the difference vector @xmath57 , which ensures that the trajectory has come back closest to the initial point .",
    "a standard method to search for zeros of @xmath58 in low - dimensional systems ( typically @xmath59 ) is the newton - raphson method .",
    "this iterative algorithm , based on successive taylor expansions of @xmath58 , produces a sequence of iterates @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62     to minimise in order to find exact periodic orbits.,width=377 ]    @xmath63 being the jacobian matrix associated to @xmath58 .",
    "when no analytical expression for @xmath63 is available , it is generally computed by finite differences , at the cost of one evaluation of @xmath58 for each column of the matrix . in very high dimension @xmath64 , however , the time needed for @xmath65 evaluations of @xmath58 , as well as the storage of @xmath63 ( not to mention solving equation ( [ newtonstep ] ) ) , can become prohibitive , thus we turn our attention towards matrix - free inexact newton - krylov methods .",
    "at every newton step @xmath66 , we solve the system ( [ newtonstep ] ) using the gmres algorithm.@xcite this iterative linear solver only requires matrix - vector products that can be evaluated using finite differences , since for a vector @xmath67 and @xmath68 sufficiently small ( e.g. @xmath69 ) we have : @xmath70 hence no matrix needs to be stored explicitly . using ( [ jp ] ) , gmres iteratively builds an orthogonal basis of the krylov subspace spanned by @xmath71 , starting from @xmath72 . at each gmres step ,",
    "a gram - schmidt procedure reorthonormalises the krylov subspace producing a basis @xmath73 .",
    "then an approximation to the solution of ( [ newtonstep ] ) is constructed on this basis , until convergence is decided according to the criterion : @xmath74 the ` forcing ' constant @xmath75 appearing in formula ( [ inexact ] ) is ideally zero , and numerically it should be in principle very small .",
    "however , non - vanishing values of @xmath76 can allow for a much quicker convergence of the overall newton scheme , by avoiding useless oversolving .",
    "values of @xmath77 have produced faster convergence and even better performances were observed when updating @xmath75 with the choice 2 of eisenstat & walker.@xcite      newton - raphson algorithms are known to converge only if the initial guess is sufficiently close to a zero of the function @xmath58 , which in high dimension often means no convergence at all .",
    "moreover , even close to a solution , newton - raphson steps either can be too large or nearly orthogonal to the gradient of @xmath78 , in which case the algorithm stagnates and the classical strategy of linear backtracking ( also called ` damped newton ' ) is of no help.@xcite to remedy this , it is useful to embed the algorithm into what is commonly called a ` globally ' convergent strategy . here `",
    "global ' does not mean that convergence is achieved whatever the starting point , but instead that the basin of attraction of a solution is reasonably enlarged .",
    "we adopt the ` double dogleg step ' method proposed by dennis and schnabel,@xcite which is a subclass of the ` trust region ' algorithms ( see viswanath@xcite for an implementation of another subclass call the ` hook step ' approach ) .",
    "all these methods start from the knowledge of the newton step @xmath79 ( here we omit the superscript @xmath80 ) , and aim at constructing a new vector @xmath81 whose norm is bounded by a ` trust length ' @xmath82 .",

    "if it is , then the loop is finished and we set @xmath88 to @xmath89 ; if not , then @xmath90 is divided by 2 , a new vector @xmath81 is computed and the process is repeated .    in the case of the double dogleg step , two descent directions for @xmath91 are used to generate the new vector @xmath81 : the first one is the newton step @xmath92 , the second is the steepest descent direction ( see figure [ dogleg ] ) : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the transpose of the jacobian matrix @xmath63 . we can define the cauchy point @xmath95 , where the vector @xmath96 minimizes the quadratic form @xmath97 along the steepest descent direction ( whereas the overall minimizer of this quadratic form defines the newton step @xmath98 ) .",
    "projection of @xmath96 onto the krylov space ( already built to find @xmath79 at the same newton iteration ) allows a low - cost approximation of @xmath96 , as long as the dimension of the krylov subspace itself is low .",

    ", this numerical discrepancy has increased by a factor @xmath206 , with @xmath207 being now the largest floquet exponent of the rpo .",
    "indeed a useful rule - of - thumb for estimating the lowest residual attainable is : @xmath208 we can illustrate this formula by simply time - stepping from a sufficiently converged asymmetric tw at @xmath209 .",

    "sufficiently close to the hopf bifurcation , both the rpo and the tw are expected to have the same leading floquet exponent @xmath207 , hence the estimation @xmath213 .",
    "since the period @xmath12 does not vary much ( less than @xmath214 ) within the range of @xmath168 considered , we can extract from the data in figure 6 a trend for the floquet exponent of the rpo .",
    "we found the following scaling : @xmath215 , with @xmath216 very close to @xmath217 .",
    "unsurprisingly , the rpo is more unstable away from the bifurcation point .",
    "a possible explanation is the stronger slow - time modulation of the streaks ( whose strong transversal velocity gradients are already responsible for the inertial instability of the tw ) as @xmath168 increases .",
    "this harmonic modulation of the streaky field over a full cycle is likely to increase the instability of the whole flow .",
    "a leading question is how the rpo found in this paper is related to transition to turbulence in a pipe .",
    "the asymmetric tw is already known to play a special role .",
    "firstly , it lies on the laminar - turbulent boundary ( also called the ` edge of chaos ' @xcite ) , which is the set of initial conditions separating trajectories which directly relaminarise from those which lead to turbulent behaviour .",
    "this means that infinitesimal perturbations to the tw can either lead to transition or relaminarisation , depending on their exact form .",
    "secondly , recent studies have shown that for analogous parameters , but larger @xmath5 , this asymmetric tw is generally the only exact travelling wave solution closely visited by trajectories when constrained on the laminar - turbulent boundary .",
    "@xcite it is thus interesting to see if other kind of exact recurrent states , like the rpo found here fulfil the expectation of : ( a ) lying on the laminar - turbulent boundary as well ; ( b ) connecting to other states via heteroclinic connections ; and ( c ) getting transiently approached by transitional trajectories .",
    "we have chosen to concentrate on @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) , and perturbed the rpo by two random vectors in the following manner : @xmath220 in this expression , @xmath68 is a small parameter ( here @xmath221 ) , @xmath222 and @xmath223 are two random vectors of norm unity , which are generic enough to possess non - zero components along the unstable manifold of the rpo .",
    "@xmath224 is a shooting angle which has been varied in the range @xmath225 $ ] .",
    "we notice that several trajectories starting from the new state @xmath226 relaminarise directly while other trajectories undergo a short ` turbulent ' transient , indicated by a dramatic rise in the kinetic energy and dissipation of the disturbance to the laminar flow , and by a loss of symmetry of the flow .",
    "hence the rpo found for @xmath219 is also on the laminar - turbulent boundary .",
    "+ establishing heteroclinic connections between the rpo and other exact coherent structures is an involved and technically demanding task .",
    "we can , however , seek suggestive evidence for such links by exploring the evolution of trajectories originating close to the rpo and confined to remain in the laminar - turbulent boundary .",
    "this was attempted for the rpo at @xmath218 by refining the angle @xmath224 defined in ( [ shoot ] ) to find a phase - space trajectory which stays near the laminar - turbulent boundary , i.e. neither directly relaminarises nor undergoes a turbulent transient .",
    "this is done via shooting method based on bisection of the value of @xmath224 .",
    "refining @xmath224 up to three significant digits results in a trajectory called @xmath227 , which eventually relaminarises after a significantly long transient along the laminar - turbulent boundary . for a short duration during the transient ( less than @xmath228 ) , all velocity components oscillate with the same apparent period on a short - time scale , while the energy reaches a plateau .",

    "the slow - time modulation reflects the modulation of the flow along the rpo .",

    "establishing this formally is a significant undertaking not pursued further here but the idea that trajectories link different coherent structures to produce a saddle structure on the laminar - turbulent boundary is consistent with other recent observations.@xcite    the trajectories @xmath227 and @xmath242 are projected on a two - dimensional @xmath251 diagram in figure [ heterodissrpo ] .",

    "asymmetric tw solutions are recurrently approached by laminar - turbulent trajectories;@xcite here for @xmath271 ( @xmath140 ) and @xmath219 , the same conclusion seems to hold .",
    "however , now this schematic view of edge trajectories recurrently visiting neighbourhoods of tws needs to be extended to take into account relative periodic orbits .",
    "all these solutions and their stable manifolds make up the laminar - turbulent boundary . + the main problem in accurately identifying rpos is the exponential divergence of a nearby orbit from the rpo . in practice , the instability of the rpo together with its typically long period lead to a large value for its leading characteristic multiplier .",
    "this causes a significant loss of numerical accuracy when searching for neighbouring orbits which almost close on themselves .",

    "there are ways to improve the numerical algorithm such as a multiple - shooting technique where the orbit is subdivided into manageable pieces which now clearly need to be explored .",
    "physically , the instability of the rpo means that phase - space trajectories are unlikely to spend a long time in its vicinity , despite the likelihood that the rpo is linked via heteroclinic connections to other more attracting solutions .",
    "in particular , the probability is low that such a solution could be identified experimentally , despite recent progress made in flow visualisation or indeed numerically as part of a direct numerical simulation .",

    "the mirror - symmetric branch displays another one near @xmath273 , its period near the bifurcating point is @xmath274 , which makes it even more unstable and harder to continue than the previous one . for the same parameters , we have checked that another known branch of tw ( referred to as @xmath275 @xcite ) does not display any hopf bifurcations at all below @xmath276 . despite the fact that many more tws might exist",
    ", it appears that hopf bifurcations of lower - branch tw solutions are not frequent , and that short - period rpos associated with them are not generic objects . from this point of view",
