    "is provided in appendix [ b ] .    an important figure of merit of the qd - cavity system is the cooperativity parameter @xmath30 . by fitting our model to the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we find @xmath33 , a value similar to previously reported @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are produced with the same parameters for @xmath30 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and fit the experimental data very well .",
    "the results demonstrate how in a polarization degenerate cavity the fine - split excited states of a neutral qd can be simultaneously addressed in a coherent way .",
    "furthermore , these interference measurements hold great promise as a clever combination of @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be used to tune the constructive or destructive interference between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this forms a generic technique to increase the ratio between an uncoupled and a coupled cavity system , and thereby the fidelity of entanglement operations .",
    "now we turn to a different qd in the same polarization degenerate cavity , but operated in a voltage regime around @xmath61 v where it is singly negatively charged .",
    "this system is of particular importance in quantum information as the optical transitions are polarization degenerate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( a ) ) , due to cancellation of electron - hole exchange interaction , and enables coherent control of the resident electron spin if a small in - plane magnetic field is applied .",

    "[ fig2 ]  ( c ) , we now observe a strongly reduced contrast of the qd resonance , which is @xmath67 when circularly polarized light is used and @xmath68 for linear polarization .",
    "we use a slightly larger laser power ( @xmath69 pw ) compared to the neutral qd as we find that the charging effects are now significantly smaller , due to less absorption of the resonant laser at this voltage .",
    "furthermore , this intensity corresponds to a mean intracavity photon number @xmath70 , and is therefore sufficiently small to prevent qd saturation effects from occurring .",
    "in addition , we compared the cross - polarized transmitted intensity for circular and linear polarized light . for circular ( @xmath62 and @xmath71 ) polarization , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( d ) , we observe negligible transmission , indicating that circular polarization remains unchanged .",
    "surprisingly , for two linear orthogonal ( lin1 and lin2 ) polarizations displayed in fig .  [ fig4 ]  ( e ) , we observe that about 10% of the light is transmitted relative to @xmath65 , despite the low cooperativity ( see below ) .",

    "we will first try to explain our observations with a coherent model , which we adapt to the four - level system of a charged qd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( a ) : the ground state consists of the two spin eigenstates , oriented in the out - of - plane direction , which couple with two corresponding trion lowest - energy excited states by degenerate circularly polarized optical transitions carrying spin @xmath72 .",
    "we write @xmath73 for the corresponding transmission amplitudes of @xmath74 polarized light coupling with a corresponding transition , and @xmath75 for the case of an empty cavity .",
    "since we do not control the electron spin state it can be in any random state @xmath76 . with the incoming photon state @xmath77 , we obtain for the input quantum state @xmath78 . the spin - selective interaction with the cavity - qd system",
    "entangles the photon with the electron spin via @xmath79    we then project this output state onto the detected polarization @xmath80 , and take the trace over the electron spin to obtain the projected transmission : @xmath81    since we do not control the spin state we use @xmath82 for the balanced case .",
    "note that this model ( m1 ) is coherent in the sense that it still contains interference between the @xmath83 and @xmath84 terms .",
    "the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( c ) shows how model m1 fits our data for the optimum cavity - qd coupling and qd dephasing parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 ns@xmath35 .",
    "the dephasing rate can not be explained by the decay rate of the excited state , since lifetime measurements showed this to be about 1.2 ns .",
    "instead , we attribute this much faster dephasing rate to an efficient cotunneling process across the 20 nm electron tunnel barrier , which is expected to be more pronounced for the flatter conduction band here compared to the neutral qd case presented before .",
    "this fast dephasing also reduces the cooperativity , which , however , might also be reduced due to low spatial overlap between the qd and the cavity mode .",
    "we expect that utilizing a thicker 35 nm tunnel barrier will decrease the cotunneling process and enable high fidelity spin state preparation @xcite .",
    "next we consider the linear - polarization data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( c , e ) , where the model prediction is shown by red lines .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) predicts that purely circular polarized light should pass the cavity unmodified , and can therefore be fully blocked by a crossed polarizer ( @xmath87 ) , which is indeed what we observe experimentally in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( d ) .",
    "significant discrepancies between the data and our model are however observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( c ) and in",
    "( e ) particularly , where the cross - polarized transmission signal for linear - polarizations lin1 and lin2 is much larger than expected .",
    "this can not be caused by an energy splitting , or phase difference , between the two transitions , as these splittings would have been visible in the data .",
    "furthermore , the observed cross - polarized transmission is so large that it would require @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) to explain the cross - polarized transmission in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( e ) , while we found @xmath85 for the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( b ) .",
    "this result therefore indicates that additional dephasing processes take place that project linear polarized light on the preferred circular basis of the qd transitions .",
    "the preference for this basis is known from literature refs .",
    "@xcite and is experimentally demonstrated by the fact that circular polarized light remains circular polarized after the interaction with the qd  cavity system . if the absorption and re - emission of linear light would be a fully coherent process , the linear polarization should largely remain , which is clearly not the case in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( e ) .    to model the results , we now introduce a tentative model ( m2 ) that describes the spin - exciton system as if it were fully decoherent , meaning that any light interacting with the qd is instantaneously projected on the qd transition polarization basis .",
    "this corresponds to immediate decoherence of the entangled state described by eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and elimination of interference between the @xmath83 and @xmath84 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . since only a fraction of the light that enters",
    "the cavity becomes entangled with the qd spin state , we first need to calculate the fraction of the light that did not interact .",
    "we estimate this fraction @xmath89 by multiplying the cavity transmission with the qd response function : @xmath90 .",
    "the intensities of the circularly polarized components of the transmitted light that interacted with a parallel or opposite electron spin are now given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the total transmitted intensity corresponds now to the incoherent sum of five transmission channels : @xmath93    the transmission predicted by the incoherent model ( m2 , eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ) and coherent model ( m1 , eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ) are equivalent in case of circular incoming polarization ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( b , d ) ) .",
    "they differentiate however in case of the linear - polarization data in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( c , e ) .",
    "the solid black curves predicted by the incoherent model ( m2 ) , based on the parameters deduced from fig .  [ fig4 ]  ( b ) , agrees very well while the coherent model ( m1 ) does not .",
    "while the polarization degenerate microcavities enables systematic polarization analysis and the identification of a high degree of decoherence in the charged qd system , the exact origin of decoherence is not known to us .",
    "we think it is related to the cotunneling process and future sample designs with thicker tunnel barriers will resolve this issue .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated a polarization degenerate solid - state cavity qed system with charge control , which allows full use of all polarization degrees of freedom . here , simple polarimetric reflection and transmission measurements enable the study of the coherence properties of the coupled qd  cavity system , for neutral and charged quantum dots .",

    "<S> we also study a charged qd that suffers from decoherence , and find also in this case that availability of the full polarization degrees of freedom is crucial to reveal the dynamics of the qd transitions . </S>",
    "<S> our results pave the way for postselection - free quantum devices based on electron spin  photon polarization entanglement . </S>"
