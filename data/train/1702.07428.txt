    "the @xmath21 scuti pulsator ee cam is classified as an f3 star on basis of the str@xmath22mgren indices ( olsen 1980 ) .",
    "the star was firstly discovered to be a variable star in the @xmath23 mission ( perryman et al .",

    "the first comprehensive frequency analysis of the photometric data for ee cam was published by breger et al .",
    "ee cam was observed photometrically for 87 nights from 2006 to 2007 using the vienna university automatic photoelectric telescope ( strassmeier et al .",

    "2001 ) , situated in washington camp , arizona , usa . fifteen oscillation frequencies were detected ( breger et al . 2007 ) . with @xmath26 nights additional photometric data ,",
    "the number of detected frequencies was increased to forty , of which thirty - seven were independent ( breger et al .",
    "these oscillation frequencies are shown in table 1 of breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "in addition , breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) compared the observed phase shifts and amplitude ratios with those derived from theoretical models .",
    "they identified the dominant mode @xmath7 = 57.101 @xmath27hz as a radial mode and the second dominant mode @xmath28 = 60.345 @xmath27hz as a nonradial mode with @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) performed a detailed analysis of pulsation instability , and suggested the radial mode @xmath7 as the fundamental radial mode .",
    "both of the radial mode and nonradial oscillation modes are detected .",
    "different oscillation modes show different propagation behaviors in the star , thus ee cam is an ideal object for asteroseismology .",
    "our work extends the work of breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and presents a comprehensive asteroseismic analysis for ee cam .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we propose our mode identification on basis of rotational splitting . in section 3 , we describe the details of stellar models .",
    "fundamental parameters of ee cam is introduced in section 3.1 , input physics are elaborated in section 3.2 , and model grids are presented in section 3.3 .",
    "we analyze our asteroseimic results in section 4 .",
    "the best - fitting model are elaborated in section 4.1 , the fitting result is discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "finally , we conclude the results of our work in section 5 .",
    "according to the theory of stellar oscillations , each oscillation mode can be characterized by three spherical harmonic numbers : the radial orders @xmath29 , the spherical harmonic degree @xmath0 , and the azimuthal order @xmath30 .",
    "if a star is rotating , departures from spherical symmetry caused by stellar rotation will result in the nonradial oscillation mode splitting into 2@xmath0 + 1 different frequencies . for high - order g modes ,",
    "the approximate formula of the rotational splitting @xmath31 and the rotational period @xmath3 can be described as @xmath32 ( brickhill 1975 ) . in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath30 varies from @xmath33 to @xmath0 , a total of 2@xmath0 + 1 different values .",
    "the value of @xmath34 of ee cam is measured to be 40 @xmath35 3 km @xmath36 by breger et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and to be 51 @xmath35 8 km @xmath36 by bush @xmath25 hintz ( 2008 ) .",
    "the two results of @xmath37 are consistent within @xmath38 error . besides , breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed the inclination angle @xmath39 being 34 @xmath35 4 deg .",
    "then the equatorial rotation velocity is estimated to be 72 @xmath35 10 km @xmath36 from @xmath34 of breger et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and to be 91 @xmath35 25 km @xmath36 from the result of bush @xmath25 hintz ( 2008 ) .",
    "according to the analyses of chen et al .",
    "( 2017 ) , the second - order effect of rotation is much smaller than that of the first - order . thus the second - order effect of rotation is neglected in our work .    according to equation ( 1 ) , splitting frequencies with @xmath1 form a triplet and splitting frequencies with @xmath2 form a quintuplet .",
    "moreover , the rotational splitting of @xmath1 modes and that of @xmath2 modes meet the proportional relation @xmath40 ( winget et al .",
    "based on the above analyses , we search for potentially rotational splits in the frequency spectra of ee cam and list them in table 1 .",
    "the frequency i d in table 1 follows the serial numbers of breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .    a total of fifteen sets of possible multiplets are found .",
    "the averaged value of the frequency splitting @xmath41 in multiplet 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 is 3.256 @xmath27hz .",
    "the averaged value of the frequency splitting @xmath42 in multiplet 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 is 5.403 @xmath27hz .",
    "the ratio of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is 0.603 , which agrees well with equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we hence identify the spherical harmonic degree of frequencies in multiplet 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 as @xmath1 , and the spherical harmonic degree of frequencies in multiplet 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 as @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , it can be noticed in table 1 that the identifications of the azimuthal order @xmath30 of oscillation frequencies are unique in multiplet 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 13 , 14 , and 15 .",
    "however , the identifications of the azimuthal order @xmath30 of oscillation frequencies in other multiplets allow of more possibilities ( e.g. , two possibilities in multiplet 2 , 3 , 4 , 11 , and 12 , three possibilities in multiplet 10 , and four possibilities in multiplet 8 and 9 ) . the photometric mode identifications of breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) show that @xmath28 is a mode with @xmath1 and @xmath43 is a mode with @xmath1 or @xmath2 . moreover , breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) suggest @xmath43 being a dipole mode on basis of the line - profile variations .",
    "our mode identifications are in good agreement with those of breger et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "finally , three oscillation frequencies do not show frequency splitting , i.e. , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we notice that @xmath44 and @xmath47 have a frequency difference about 10.644 @xmath27hz , about twice of @xmath42 .",

    "the frequency difference between @xmath47 and @xmath5 is in good agreement with the value between @xmath48 and @xmath5 .",
    "the frequency difference between @xmath46 and @xmath48 is about 16.191 @xmath27hz , about three times of @xmath42 .",
    "the case of @xmath46 is similar to that of @xmath44 .",
    "the mode identification of @xmath49 allows of two possibilities , i.e. , as a mode with @xmath1 or as a mode with @xmath2 .",
    "frequencies @xmath50 and @xmath49 have a difference of about 6.438 @xmath27hz , about twice of @xmath41 .",
    "thus the spherical harmonic degree @xmath0 of @xmath50 and @xmath49 can be identified as @xmath1 , and their azimuthal order @xmath30 can be uniquely identified as being @xmath51(-1,+1 ) .",
    "this case is listed in table 1 . besides",
    ", @xmath45 and @xmath49 have a frequency difference of @xmath52 @xmath27hz , about four times of @xmath42 . in this case , the spherical harmonic degree of @xmath45 and @xmath49 are identified as @xmath2 , and their azimuthal order @xmath30 are uniquely identified as being @xmath30=(-2,+2 ) .    based on the regularities of rotational splitting , five sets of multiplets with @xmath0 = 1 and ten sets of multiplets with @xmath0 = 2 are identified .",
    "due to departures from the asymptotic formula , frequency differences in these multiplets may slightly deviate from the averaged values of rotational splitting .",
    "furthermore , it can be noticed in table 1 that only two components are detected in multiplet 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 .",
    "other physical factors like the phenomenon of avoided crossings ( aizenman et al .",
    "1977 ) and the large separation resulted from the isolated modes ( garca hernndez et al . 2013 ; lignires et al .",
    "2006 ) are also possible .",
    "based on above analyses , the frequency spectra of ee cam can be disentangled only with oscillation modes of @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "oscillation modes with @xmath0 =3 are not considered in this work .",
    "this situation is very different from those of hd 50844 ( chen et al . 2016 ) and corot 102749568 ( chen et al . 2017 ) . according to the theory of stellar oscillations ,",
    "the spherical harmonic degree @xmath0 is the number of nodal lines by which the stellar surface is divided to oscillate in the opposite phase .",
    "the stellar surface will be divided into more zones for higher value of the spherical harmonic degree @xmath0 . due to the effect of geometrical cancellation ,",
    "the detections of oscillation frequencies with higher degree need much higher precision observations .",
