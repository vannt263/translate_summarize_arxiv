    "the magnetic - field and pressure - induced quantum phase transitions in tlcucl@xmath0 and kcucl@xmath1 have been extensively studied.@xcite in the spin - gapped phase , the @xmath2 interacting antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin dimer system has a spin - triplet excited state separated from the spin - singlet ground state . because of the magnetic interaction between spin dimers , the excited state is dispersive and then the spin - gap energy is much lower than that of the isolated spin dimers .",
    "this is described by the bond - operator model.@xcite the zeeman effect under a magnetic field , the increase of interdimer interaction under high pressure and/or the impurity doping cause the quantum phase transition to the ordered phase .",
    "the ordered phase is characterized by the absence of the spin gap and the af ordered moment of which amplitude can fluctuate .",
    "this fluctuation is the longitudinal magnetic excitation which we focus on in this paper .    as well as inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) ,",
    "the inelastic light scattering , known as raman scattering , is a powerful tool to detect the longitudinal magnetic excitation.@xcite in the quantum phase induced by magnetic field , the longitudinal magnon excitation is detected as a one - magnon raman peak induced through the second - order exchange interaction raman process.@xcite comparing ins , only a small size of sample is enough to measure raman scattering . using the diamond anvil cell ( dac )",
    ", we can apply hydrostatic pressure up to about 10 gpa .",
    "these are advantages of raman scattering . in this paper",
    ", we report the one - magnon raman scattering in the pressure - induced ordered phase of kcucl@xmath1 .",
    "the single crystal of kcucl@xmath0 was grown from a melt by the standard bridgeman technique . a small piece of it with a size of 100 @xmath3 50 @xmath3 10 @xmath4 m was enclosed into dac .",
    "and then , the dac was placed in a continuous flow type cryostat to cool the single crystal down to 3 k.    we used he gas as a pressure medium because it gives almost hydrostatic conditions.@xcitemoreover , the single crystal is easily dissolved in methanol - ethanol mixture , which is a standard pressure medium .",
    "the pressure @xmath5 was monitored by using the wavelength shift of the @xmath6 fluorescence line of a ruby powder .",
    "because the wavelength of the @xmath6 fluorescence line depends on temperature , we set ruby powder in high pressure section and in the ambient pressure one ( on the back surface of diamond ) .",
    "because we can detect the @xmath6 fluorescence peaks from the ruby powder at the high pressure section and that at the ambient pressure one simultaneously , this method estimates very precise pressure at low temperatures .",
    "raman scattering was excited by an ar@xmath7-ion laser with the wavelength of 514.5 nm .",
    "the scattered light was dispersed by using a triple grating monochromator ( jobin - yvon t64000 ) and was detected by a ccd detector cooled by liquid - n@xmath8 . in order to observe the magnon raman spectra strongly ,",
    "the incident laser was polarized along the direction of the strong interdimer interaction , which is almost parallel to the one along the intradimer interaction,@xcite and we did not use the analyzer ( polarizer ) in front of the entrance slit of the monochromator .",
    "the raman shift was calibrated by using a rotational raman spectrum of air .",
    ", halfwidth @xmath9 and squared coupling coefficient @xmath10 of the one - magnon raman peak at 1.9 gpa .",
    "the details of the fitting are written in text . ]",
    "figure 1(a ) shows raman spectra at 3 and 20 k under pressures of 1.9 and 5.2 gpa .",
    "the raman intensity was normalized by the integrated intensity of the raman peak around 300 @xmath11 in each spectrum , which is indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "the overall phonon raman spectrum above 50 @xmath11 is consistent with the one in the previous report at ambient pressure.@xcite the frequencies of the phonon peaks increase with increasing pressure .",
    "using this fact , we can obtain the mode grneisen constant .",
    "however , it is beyond of the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "one can see that the raman peak around 25 @xmath11 at 3 k under @xmath5 = 1.9 gpa is superimposed on the strong tail centered at 0 @xmath11 which comes from the stray light of the reflection and the rayleigh scattering .",
    "this peak was not observed at 20 k. as will be discussed in the following , this is the one - magnon raman peak from the longitudinal magnon excitation .",
    "figure 1(b ) describes the fitting procedure at @xmath5 = 5.2 gpa . for quantitative discussion",
    ", we extract the one - magnon raman peak @xmath12 from the observed raman spectrum @xmath13 , by using the nonlinear least square fit with the model of two lorentz functions on a linear background : @xmath14k_{\\rm mag}^{2 } \\gamma_{\\rm mag } }         { ( \\omega-\\omega_{\\rm mag})^{2}+\\gamma_{\\rm mag}^{2 } } + \\frac{k_{\\rm c}^{2 } \\gamma_{\\rm c}}{\\omega^{2}+\\gamma_{\\rm c}^{2 } } + ( a \\omega + b ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the frequency , the coupling coefficient and the halfwidth of the one - magnon mode ( the strong tail at 0 @xmath11 ) , the bose factor and the linear background , respectively ,    figure 1(c ) shows the temperature dependences of @xmath15 , @xmath9 and the squared coupling coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "one can see that @xmath22 decreases with increasing temperature , while @xmath15 and @xmath9 are almost independent of temperature . and",
    "therefore , we estimate @xmath22 , @xmath15 and @xmath9 at zero temperature . with the values obtained under different pressures ,",
    "we show the pressure dependences of @xmath15 , @xmath9 and @xmath22 as functions of applied pressure in fig .",
    "denotes the magnetic zone center .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]     denotes the magnetic zone center .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we observed that the frequency and halfwidth of the one - magnon raman peak are proportional to a function of @xmath23 , where the critical pressure @xmath24 (= 0.82 gpa ) was obtained by magnetization measurement under hydrostatic pressures.@xcite first , we compare these results to the results of ins in tlcucl@xmath0 taken under hydrostatic pressures.@xcite the frequency and halfwidth of the longitudinal magnetic excitation are proportional to a function of @xmath25 in tlcucl@xmath0 , where @xmath26 @xmath27 0.1 gpa .",
    "then we conclude that the one - magnon raman peak observed at low temperatures under higher pressures than 0.82 gpa comes from the longitudinal magnetic excitation through the second - order exchange interaction magnon raman process.@xcite    we focus on the halfwidth @xmath18 proportional to the frequency @xmath15 . because @xmath9 corresponds to the inverse lifetime of magnon",
    ", we consider the decay process of the longitudinal magnetic excitation . in the bond - operator model , the terms of two spin scalar product in the spin hamiltonian and the effective magnon raman operator",
    "are expressed as the quadratic terms of the singlet and triplet operators.@xcite in the ordered phase , these operators are mixed with each other and the system can be rewritten by using the quadratic terms of the four mixed singlet - triplet operators . because one of these four can be treated as the uniformly condensed mean - field operator ( @xmath28-number operator , @xmath29 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the interdimer interaction can be written by using three kinds of operators ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath33 is the momentum of magnon ) . here",
    "@xmath30 is the annihilation operator of the longitudinal magnetic excitation and the other two are those of the transverse ones.@xcite the spin hamiltonian and the effective raman operator contain the terms of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes one of @xmath30 , @xmath39 , @xmath31 , @xmath40 , @xmath32 and @xmath41 . to minimize the magnetic energy ,",
    "the @xmath34 term in the spin hamiltonian should vanish .",
    "we note here that the @xmath34 term in the raman operator can be finite even in this case .",
    "this is the origin of the one - magnon raman scattering.@xcite the magnon dispersion curve comes from the @xmath42 terms in the exchange interaction.@xcite from an analogy with the anharmonicity problem of phonons , one can easily show that the @xmath43 term gives the finite lifetime of magnon due to the magnon - magnon decay in fig .",
    "3 , which is omitted in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider the magnon - magnon decay channel discussed by kulik and sushkov @xcite for the lifetime of the longitudinal magnetic excitation at the magnetic @xmath44 point @xmath45 .",
    "this raman - active mode is massive and its dispersion curve around @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath46 with the minimum energy at @xmath45 . below this energy",
    ", there exists only two branches of the magnetic excitations , i.e. , two transverse modes .",
    "these are the goldstone modes of which dispersion curve around @xmath45 have a linear function of @xmath47 .",
    "the possible magnon - magnon decay channel can be found easily by using the geometric procedure on the energy - momentum space , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . because the number of decay channels is proportional to @xmath48 , the transition probability for one channel should be proportional to @xmath49 , resulting in the halfwidth proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "these can be calculated by using the bond - operator method , which will be published elsewhere .",
    "the bond operator theory predicts that @xmath50,@xcite which is inconsistent with our observation . the strong tail at 0 @xmath11 might be a possible origin of this deviation .",
    "as we stated , we normalized the squared coupling coefficient by that of the phonon mode around 300 @xmath11 , i.e. , we implicitly suppose the pressure independent properties of this phonon .",
    "we omit the raman intensity through the three magnon raman process , which was observed at ambient pressure.@xcite these are other possible origins of this deviation .",
