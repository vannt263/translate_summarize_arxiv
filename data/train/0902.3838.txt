    "<S> we consider spatially two dimensional madelung fluid whose irrotational motion reduces into the schrdinger equation for a single free particle . in this respect , we regard the former as a direct generalization of the latter , allowing a rotational quantum flow . </S>",
    "<S> we then ask for the most likely wave function possessing a given average energy by maximizing the shannon information entropy over the quantum probability density . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exists a class of solutions in which the wave function is self - trapped , rotationally symmetric , spatially localized with finite support , and spinning around its center , yet stationary . </S>",
    "<S> the stationarity comes from the balance between the attractive quantum force field of a trapping quantum potential generated by quantum probability density and the repulsive centrifugal force of a rotating velocity vector field . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that there is a limiting case where the wave function is non - spinning and yet still stationary . </S>",
    "<S> this special state turns out to be the lowest stationary state of the ordinary schrdinger equation for a particle in a cylindrical tube classical potential . </S>"
