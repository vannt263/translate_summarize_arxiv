    "effective field theories are an extremely useful tool for studying the dynamics of particles at low energies .",
    "an effective lagrangian typically has an expansion in inverse powers of some mass scale @xmath3 , and describes dynamics at momentum scales which are much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "for example , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite describes the dynamics of hadrons containing a single heavy quark of mass @xmath4 at momentum transfers much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "the hqet lagrangian has an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath4 , and is used to compute hadronic properties as an expansion in @xmath5 , where @xmath6  mev is a typical strong interaction scale .",
    "the scale at which the hqet lagrangian ceases to be useful is the mass @xmath4 of the heavy quark .",
    "hqet can be used to study the interaction of a single heavy quark with light degrees of freedom , provided the momentum transfer is small compared with @xmath4 .",
    "systems containing a heavy quark and antiquark ( or two heavy quarks ) can not be described by hqet . as @xmath7 , the quark and antiquark form a coulomb bound state of size @xmath8 , and typical momentum transfer @xmath9 .",
    "perturbation theory is infrared divergent , with terms of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the relative velocity of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the center of mass frame .",
    "these infrared singular terms cause a breakdown of perturbation theory , and must be resummed .",
    "resummation of the most singular @xmath14 terms is equivalent to solving the schrodinger equation in a coulomb potential , and the resummed @xmath15 scattering amplitude contains the corresponding bound state poles .",
    "one can construct a different effective field theory , nrqcd ( non - relativistic qcd ) , that is appropriate for the study of @xmath16 bound states in qcd ( or its qed analog , nrqed for the study of positronium ) @xcite .",
    "the terms in the nrqcd lagrangian are of the same form as those for hqet , but nrqcd has a different power counting scheme than hqet . in hqet ,",
    "the power counting of operators is manifest .",
    "an operator with coefficient @xmath17 has a matrix element of order @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the quark kinetic energy operator @xmath19 is of order @xmath20 , and is subleading . the power counting is more subtle in nrqcd  @xmath21 is treated as a leading order operator , and higher dimension operators are suppressed not by powers of @xmath22 but by powers of the relative three - velocity of the heavy quarks .",
    "we will refer to theories such as hqet , in which @xmath23 is of leading order but @xmath24 is small , as static theories , and will refer to theories such as nrqcd , in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both of leading order , as non - relativistic theories .    in this paper , we study the problem of non - relativistic bound states in effective field theories . in sec .",

    "we study whether the effective theory can `` produce its own bound state , '' that is , whether one can obtain a composite weakly bound state in an effective theory where the higher dimensional operators have small coefficients .",
    "we show that in @xmath0 dimensions , the effective four - fermi theory has a radius of convergence of order the scalar mass , and produces a weakly bound state with perturbative coefficients for higher dimension operators when the parameters of the yukawa theory are such that there is one weakly bound state in the spectrum .",
    "if the yukawa theory has two or more bound states of which one is weakly bound , the radius of convergence of the four - fermi effective theory vanishes as the weakly bound state approaches threshold , and the higher dimension operators have large coefficients . in @xmath1 dimensions ,",
    "the four - fermi effective theory has a finite radius of convergence and higher dimension operators with small coefficients only when there is no bound state near threshold in the yukawa theory .",

    "it is also trivial to count powers of @xmath27 in loop graphs . the quark and gluon propagators are independent of @xmath4 , so any feynman graph with @xmath46 vertices of order @xmath47 has an overall factor of @xmath17 , where @xmath48 .",

    "the quark propagator depends on @xmath4 , so that one can get factors of @xmath4 from loop graphs , and the power counting rules for loop graphs in nrqcd is not as straightforward as in hqet .",
    "furthermore , there are several relevant scales in nrqcd : @xmath4 , the three - moment of the heavy quarks @xmath50 , the kinetic energy of the heavy quarks @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the matrix elements of higher dimension operators in nrqcd are suppressed by powers of @xmath11 , but the @xmath11 counting is not manifest in the lagrangian .",
    "it is advantageous to have an effective field theory with manifest power counting rules .",

    "this gives the relation between the rescaled energy and momentum @xmath66 and @xmath67 and the original variables @xmath35 and @xmath31 , @xmath68 in a nonrelativistic system the rescaled energy and momentum are both of order unity .    upon rescaling , the lagrangian density picks up an overall factor of @xmath69 from the change of integration variables @xmath70 , so the @xmath71 term is canonically normalized if @xmath72 . the gauge field quadratic terms get rescaled to @xmath73 in the infrared , @xmath74 , and the dominant gauge kinetic terms are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these terms are properly normalized if @xmath77 with this rescaling the nrqcd lagrangian becomes @xmath78 which will be referred to as the rnrqcd ( rescaled nrqcd ) lagrangian .",
    "( the effective lagrangian also contains the corresponding terms for the heavy antiquark field . )",
    "it is clear from the form of the rnrqcd lagrangian that the effective coupling constant in the @xmath79 sector for coulomb gluons ( i.e @xmath59 ) is @xmath80 , not @xmath81 . at low velocities ,",
    "the coulomb gluon interaction must be summed to all orders .",

    "@xcite this operator is of order @xmath89 .",
    "however , the nrqcd power counting refers to the size of the matrix element of the operator in a quark - antiquark state .",
    "the chromomagnetic gluon must therefore be attached to one of the external quark lines , which costs an additional power of @xmath94 ; hence the matrix element of the operator eq .",
    "( [ chromo ] ) is of order @xmath95 in a quarkonium state , as expected .",
    "the quark propagator in rnrqcd is @xmath96 and the propagator for @xmath97 is @xmath98 which are both independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the transverse gluon propagator is @xmath99 which depends on @xmath11 , so there are potential @xmath85 enhancements from graphs with internal transverse gluons .",
    "a generic loop integral can be evaluated by first doing the @xmath66 integral using residues .",
    "the residue of the transverse gluon propagator at the @xmath66 pole @xmath100 is @xmath101 , which is enhanced by @xmath85 .",
    "the transverse gluon propagator contribution from other poles ( such as fermion poles ) is typically of order unity , since these poles are at values of @xmath66 of order unity .",

    "it is not possible to choose a rescaling scheme which has a manifest @xmath11-counting scheme for real and virtual transverse gluons .",
    "the reason is that quarks behave like non - relativistic particles when transverse gluons are exchanged between them , but like static particles when one of them radiates an on - shell transverse gluon .      at leading order in @xmath11 , the only diagrams which contribute to @xmath103 scattering in the effective theory are the coulomb ladder graphs of fig .",

    "what is different here is that in the rescaled theory , the sum of the leading order graphs is identical to the schrodinger equation .",
    "while this is also the case for nrqcd in coulomb gauge , the rescaling allows similar results to be obtained in non - gauge theories , such as yukawa theory ( which we will discuss at length in the next section ) , where there is no gauge freedom in choosing the propagator .",

    "the region of convergence is not controlled by the scalar mass , and vanishes as the bound state approaches threshold .",
    "thus , we still do not have the situation we had in weakly bound 1 + 1 dimensional theory in which the bound state was correctly predicted in the low - energy theory but the radius of convergence of the theory was set by the heavy scalar mass .",
    "the results are unchanged when pions are included in the chiral lagrangian , since pion exchange scales with @xmath3 and @xmath11 in the same way as the dimension six contact interactions .",

    "this does not mean that the effective field theory idea is useless : it does mean , however , that the usual chiral lagrangian is not the correct effective field theory . if the appropriate low energy degrees of freedom are introduced by hand as new fields in the effective lagrangian , it should be possible to correctly describe low energy nucleon - nucleon scattering in an effective field theory",
