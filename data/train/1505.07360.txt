    "it can be easily proven that the integration @xmath23 over the fields @xmath20 leads to @xmath24 .",

    "such asymptotic behavior is called a higher - order asymptotic ( hoa ) and was investigated in @xcite in the model considered .",

    "the problem of analytical continuation of ( [ bor ] ) beyond the convergence domain @xmath165 can be solved either by the method of the conformal mapping of the complex plane or by pad approximation method @xcite . below",
    "we will use the conformal mapping method , because it is controlled by hoa .",
    "furthermore , it leads to more accurate results than other methods ( see @xcite ) . in our case",
    "the position of the @xmath164-function poles depends on the position of the invariant coupling constants in the ( @xmath170 , @xmath171 ) plane .",

    "there are two kinds of instantons in the model . for instanton containing one non - zero block",
    "we get @xmath173 . otherwise , instanton has two non - zero blocks and @xmath174 .",

    "the initial values of the invariant coupling constants are located in the region @xmath175 .",
    "let us apply conformal mapping method for the invariant coupling constants located in this region .",

    "this allows us to solve the equation ( [ t ] ) . as the result",
    "the root of this equation @xmath252 differs only a little from @xmath253 obtained in sect.3 .",
    "remember that @xmath253 demonstrates a weak dependence from initial values of the coupling constants @xmath90 .",
    "( dashed line ) and @xmath254 ( solid line ) at @xmath197 and @xmath245.,width=264 ]     ( dashed line ) and @xmath254 ( solid line ) at @xmath198 and @xmath245.,width=264 ]    let us discus here a possible contributions of @xmath255 operators ( [ ff ] ) to the results obtained .",
    "there are some reasons why we have not calculated these counterterms .",
    "first , we can state that these contributions are relatively small compared with @xmath256 because @xmath255 operators are more ir irrelevant in the real space dimensions @xmath257 then @xmath256 according to the canonical dimensions mentioned above .",
    "then the corresponding invariant charges will be oppressed by the first terms in the rg equations similar to ( [ lj ] ) for these variables .",
    "second , it can be simply shown by the instanton analysis presented that the high - order contributions of @xmath255 operators are small in @xmath258 compare with these of @xmath256 .    and",
    "third , the calculations of the renormalization of the full family of composite operators @xmath256 and @xmath255 is rather technically difficult now . to calculate the full renormalization constants matrix up to @xmath259 corrections one needs to consider six - loop diagrams .",
    "it is not worth while to start these calculations , as our results show that the first order phase transition takes place and the influence of @xmath256 operators on it s temperature is rather small .",
    "then we can state that in the model considered the first - order phase transition takes place at a temperature higher than the predictions for continuous phase transitions .    to estimate the temperature difference in @xmath197 case we have calculated numerically that @xmath260 in a wide range of values @xmath261 , here @xmath246 is the root of the equation ( [ t ] ) .",
    "natural to assume that the chargesare of the same order of magnitude @xmath262 .",
    "then the renormalization constants @xmath263 have the form @xmath264 . in this approximation",
    "the ratio @xmath265 equals to @xmath266 .",
    "this leads to the relation @xmath267 the integrals over momenta and sum over frequencies @xmath45 ( [ g ] , [ c0 ] ) can be reduced to the one - dimensional integrals .",
    "but the rg - approach used in our article give us an opportunities to calculate different values for small @xmath236 only .",
    "then it is sufficient to calculate these parameters ( [ g ] , [ c0 ] ) using the approximation @xmath268 .",
    "it can be found in this approximation @xmath269 with corrections @xmath270 .",
    "here @xmath271 is @xmath2-density of states at the fermi level , @xmath272 is the fermi momentum .    near the transition point @xmath71 can be estimated as @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the continuous phase transition temperature determent by the usual approach @xcite . combining ( [ tauu ] , [ gg ] , [ c ] ) we get estimation for the temperature difference between the first order phase transition and @xmath274 @xmath275",
    "in contrast to the case of the electron systems ( @xmath16 , @xmath7 - number of spin degrees of freedom ) where continuous phase transition takes place , our investigation has shown that in systems with high spin fermions ( @xmath57 ) critical fluctuations destroy stability of the system ( see fig.2 ) . in such systems",
    "the first order phase transitions take place in space dimension @xmath197 .",
    "these results were obtained by means of renormalization group analysis with @xmath56-expansion up to the fifth - loop order of perturbation theory and subsequent borel resummation .",
    "it should be noted that five loop calculations are indispensable to be sure that the first order phase transition takes place .",
    "the temperature of transition to the superconducting or superfluid phase was estimated for the systems under consideration .",
    "three loop rg analysis for composite operators , which are similar to @xmath276 in the landau - ginzburg functional , was performed for estimation of this temperature .",
    "it was revealed that transition temperature is higher than the theoretical estimation based on the continuous phase transition formalism for the same model .",
    "the obtained difference in temperatures is rather small ( see expr . ) .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that approach used in the present work is applicable for the small deviations from the phase transition temperature only .",
    "thus , in either case , we can guarantee that the difference in the phase transition temperature is not lower than our estimation .    as for 2d systems one can state that the five loop approximation is not sufficient to determine neither the phase transition type nor the phase transition temperature .",
    "the last is an excellent example in favor of further development of the high - loop calculations .",
    "the results obtained for coupling constants renormalization in three - loop approximations are presented here .",
    "five - loop results for @xmath277 , @xmath278 and three - loop results for @xmath279 are available by kalagovg@gmail.com .",
