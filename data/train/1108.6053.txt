    "the geometric frustration of magnetic interactions on lattices of magnetic moments often leads to a configurational classical ground state entropy that scales with the volume of the system , @xmath3 , as @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "this can have some unusual consequences .",
    "a well known example is the ising model on the triangular lattice with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions which has an extensive ground state entropy and exhibits no finite temperature transition .",
    "@xcite while in real materials a @xmath4 entropy left by the leading interactions is often energetically lifted by weaker interactions , leading to long - range magnetic order , there are some exceptions . for example , in the dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2spin ice materials ,  @xcite in which the magnetic moments are described by ising spins , the extensive ( @xmath6 ) low temperature entropy caused by frustration of the leading effective ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interactions is indeed lifted by the perturbing long - ranged part of the dipolar interaction .",
    "@xcite however , the degeneracy lifting in this system is so weak that the theoretically expected phase transition to magnetic long - range order is inhibited by a freezing into a spin ice state without long - range order .",
    "another possibility in a system with an exponentially ( @xmath7 $ ] ) large number of classical degenerate ground states is that thermal or quantum fluctuations might select a subset of states about which the density of zero modes is greatest .",
    "these entropic and quantum state selection mechanisms are both referred to as order - by - disorder .",
    "@xcite among pyrochlore antiferromagnets , in which the spins sit on a lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra , moessner and chalker have given a criterion for the occurrence of long - range order induced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "@xcite this criterion is based on the degree of divergence of the statistical weight of particular spin configurations @xmath8 a power - counting argument depending on the number of zero energy excitations ( zero modes ) for a given spin configuration and the number of dimensions of the ground state manifold .",
    "for example , this criterion indicates that the xy antiferromagnet with globally coplanar spins ( spins perpendicular to the global @xmath9 $ ] axis ) should exhibit entropic selection @xmath8 a result which is borne out by monte carlo simulations . @xcite for such xy systems , this comes about because the number of zero modes about collinear spin configurations is proportional to the number of spins whereas the configurational entropy in the ground state is subextensive , growing as @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite    this article is concerned with the pyrochlore xy antiferromagnet with local @xmath11 spins meaning that there is a different easy plane for each of the four tetrahedral sublattices .",
    "@xcite because such a model preserves the cubic symmetry of the pyrochlore lattice and because the single ion crystal field can , and does in various materials ,  @xcite generate such an anisotropy , it is more physical than the aforementioned pyrochlore xy model with a global easy axis .  @xcite the model has been recognized to exhibit a continuous degeneracy in its classical ground state .",
    "@xcite monte carlo simulations of the local @xmath11 xy antiferromagnet @xcite indicate that it exhibits two phases @xmath8 a high temperature paramagnetic phase and a low temperature long - range ordered phase .",
    "we refer to the magnetic structure in the ordered phase as @xmath12 to be consistent with ref .",
    "[ ] and the group theory literature .",
    "a calculation of the spectrum of the hessian about different discrete ground states @xcite suggests that the observed long - range ordered spin configuration in monte carlo simulations has the largest density of zero modes of all the degenerate ground states and , consequently , that the observed transition is an example of classical ( thermal ) obd .",
    "@xcite however , it has been suggested that selection of the long - range ordered @xmath13 state might not survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "@xcite    in this article , we give a systematic account of the properties of the local @xmath11 xy pyrochlore .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : model ] the model and its ground states . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we discuss some of the details of the monte carlo simulations performed in this work . section  [ sec : obd ] reports results of an analytical and numerical investigation of the thermal order - by - disorder mechanism , providing strong evidence that the fluctuation selection mechanism of the @xmath13 state does survive in the thermodynamic limit and giving further insight into its physical origin .",
    "we also include in section  [ sec : obd ] a subsection showing that there is a quantum order - by - disorder mechanism in the xy model as speculated but not shown in ref .",
    "[ ] . finally , in section  [ sec : eto ] , we describe the material er@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  which is an easy plane antiferromagnet exhibiting the @xmath13 structure in its ordered phase @xcite and which provides an experimental motivation for studying this model . in particular , we discuss the effect of weak dipolar interaction on the xy antiferromagnet and the problem this interaction poses for understanding the long - range ordered phase of er@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  with @xmath13 structure .",
    "in this work , we mostly focus on the problem of the zero and finite temperature behavior of interacting classical spins of length @xmath14 on the sites of a pyrochlore lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra with an infinite single - ion anisotropy such that the spins lie within their respective local xy planes perpendicular to the local @xmath11 directions . in section [ sec : obdquantum ] , we discuss the problem of order - by - disorder due to quantum fluctuations in a model with spin operators @xmath15 .  @xcite    the interactions are taken to be antiferromagnetic isotropic exchange between nearest neighbors with coupling @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . later on we also consider , as a perturbation , pseudo - dipolar interactions solely between nearest neighbours and with coupling strength @xmath18 . thus the hamiltonian is taken to be @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "consider first the exchange - only model with @xmath21 . in this case , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : model ] ) can be put into the form @xmath22 , where the sum runs over all connected tetrahedra @xcite and @xmath23 is the total spin on each tetrahedron .",
    "it follows that the ground states are all those states with zero net magnetic moment ( @xmath24 ) on each tetrahedron .",
    "therefore , we write down the conditions for the three components of the total moment on a tetrahedron to be zero . in doing so , we impose the xy constraint so that the orientation of spin @xmath25 , ( for sublattices @xmath26 ) , is given by a single angle @xmath27 measured with respect to axes within the local plane ( normal to the relevant local @xmath28 $ ] direction ) given in ref .",
    ". the condition of zero moment on each tetrahedron can then be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "there are four solution branches to these equations .",
    "each branch corresponds to a continuous degeneracy wherein all four spins are rotated smoothly within their respective local @xmath28 $ ] xy plane .",
    "we place an overbar on @xmath27 ( @xmath32 ) to signify the angle for sublattice @xmath25 giving an energy minimum ( zero moment on each tetrahedron ) .",
    "then , we label these branches in the following way : @xmath33 a further discussion of these solutions can be found in appendix a.    to enumerate all the ground states on the pyrochlore lattice we first tile all the tetrahedra with a particular spin configuration from branch @xmath34 .",
    "then , we choose a line of nearest - neighbor spins traversing the length @xmath35 of the system .",
    "the sublattice labels of the spins on the chain alternate between two values @xmath25 and @xmath36 .",
    "there are six such pairs of labels .",
    "one can then transform the spins along the chain so that the spin configurations of the associated tetrahedra belong to another branch of solutions .",
    "for example , consider a single chain made of sublattices @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "all the local angles along this chain are identical initially and equal to , say @xmath39 .",
    "we can transform these to @xmath40 with no energy cost .",
    "therefore , the entropy within the ground state manifold scales as @xmath41 as first noted in ref .",
    "[ ] . this is in contrast to both the heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet and the global easy axis ( ising ) pyrochlore antiferromagnet both of which have an extensive entropy .",
    "we note that the four branches in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : groundstates ] ) intersect in pairs .",
    "these intersection points are at special sublattice angles @xmath42 with integer @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to these as @xmath12 states in the rest of this article . by exploiting these intersection angles to move between the branches",
    ", one can smoothly visit all the ground states on a single tetrahedron and , indeed , on the whole pyrochlore lattice .",
    "if we return to the above chain of sublattices @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the @xmath46 configuration allows the tetrahedra along this chain to pass smoothly from branch @xmath34 to branch @xmath47 . as shown in refs .",
    "[ , ] and in section  [ sec : obd ] below , thermal fluctuations have the effect of selecting a magnetic structure with @xmath48 ordering wavevector and spin orientations at these discrete @xmath49 angles . there are six distinct @xmath12 ground states which are the six @xmath48 ordered states with tetrahedra tiled with local angles @xmath50 for sublattices @xmath26 and with integer @xmath43 .",
    "one can take the observation that the lattice zero modes are along sublattice chains to understand an aspect of the monte carlo results of ref .",
    "[ ] ; in particular , the finite - size scaling of the average energy of the @xmath13 states at low temperature .",
    "since this point is somewhat removed from the main story of the paper , we present the argument in appendix  [ sec : ave ] .    when @xmath51 , the continuous ground state degeneracy of the exchange only model is `` immediately '' replaced with a discrete global degeneracy with @xmath48 ordering wavevector selected from the manifold of states described above .",
    "these energetically selected states are referred to as the @xmath52 states  @xcite or palmer - chalker states in the literature after ref .",
    "the angles specifying the @xmath52 states are @xmath53 and the time - reversed configurations . in anticipation of what follows in section  [ sec : eto ] , we note that the @xmath54 states are the ground states one finds for antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange with sufficiently weak nearest - neighbor pseudo - dipolar as well as for true @xmath55 long - range magnetostatic dipolar interactions in the classical heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet model .",
