    "radio galaxies have long been used to probe the epoch of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "luminous radio galaxies are known to be highly biased relative to the underlying dark matter , residing in the most overdense regions of the universe . under the standard cold dark matter hierarchy for galaxy formation",
    "these galaxies should be the first systems to collapse and , therefore , the site of some of the most evolved stellar populations .",
    "as the likely hosts of the earliest star formation , it may also be possible to probe the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "isolating a sample of radio galaxies at high redshift would allow us to probe the physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of structure and the timescales that govern star formation in the early universe , as well as to distinguish between hierarchical and  down - sizing \" @xcite formation scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also the role of feedback on the local radio galaxy environment @xcite .",
    "while radio surveys can address many fundamental questions in cosmology and galaxy formation the numbers of radio galaxies identified at high redshift remain small in comparison to low redshift surveys @xcite . without large , statistically complete and homogeneously selected samples",
    "we can not hope to constrain hierarchical galaxy formation models without the concern that sample variance might bias our analyses .",
    "for example , at redshifts @xmath9 extensive optical and near - infrared ( nir ) campaigns have yielded less than one hundred galaxies @xcite .",
    "the reason for the paucity of these samples comes from the necessity of surveying large volumes to identify the most massive systems .",
    "given the broad redshift distribution of radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , large numbers of radio targets must be observed in order to extract the high redshift component .    in this paper",
    "we describe a novel selection technique that utilizes existing optical and radio surveys to overcome these challenges in order to isolate high redshift candidates for follow up in the nir .",
    "we show that this approach gives more than a factor of ten increase in efficiency over blind radio selected surveys .",
    "the resulting combination of nir data with existing optical measurements from sdss allows us to study the environment of the high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "early in the development of infrared observations it was noted that eros are often found in the vicinity of high redshift objects @xcite .",
    "more recently , targeted searches have been undertaken to search for clustering of galaxies @xcite and extremely red objects ( eros ) around high redshift quasars and radio galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the focus of these investigations has been whether the increased surface density of eros is physically associated with the radio galaxy or quasar , or whether it lies in the foreground , possibly as a cluster that may have gravitational lensing effects on the target .    also of interest in a near - infrared radio survey",
    "is the number of obscured quasars .",
    "it is well know that optical selection is sensitive to a wide range of effects that bias samples against the detection of heavily obscured galaxy populations . indeed",
    ", heavily obscured quasars may account for a significant fraction of the total population @xcite .",
    "our selection criteria result in the detection of a population of bright ( @xmath10 ) , red ( @xmath11 ) objects that may fall in to this category .",
    "the structure of this first in a series of papers is as follows : the target selection procedure is presented in  [ target ] .",
    "a description of the observations , astrometry and photometry is given in ",
    "the results are presented and discussed in  [ res ] , and a summary and discussion of future work is presented in  [ summ ] .",
    "sdss magnitudes are in the ab system , while we will use vega magnitudes for all @xmath1-band measurements for easy comparison with the high redshift radio galaxy literature .",
    "a flat lambda cosmology is assumed throughout , as indicated by numerous recent measurements , with @xmath12kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the @xcite model for @xmath16mjy radio sources .",
    "this shows the broad redshift distribution expected for bright radio sources .",
    "the y - axis scale is in arbitrary units .",
    "[ dndz ] ]    the main obstacle to identifying high redshift radio galaxies is screening out the low redshift foreground .",
    "figure  [ dndz ] shows a @xmath17 distribution for bright ( @xmath18mjy ) radio sources based on model radio luminosity functions and assuming pure luminosity evolution @xcite . with a broad redshift peak at @xmath19 extracting only the high-@xmath20 galaxies through blind spectroscopic follow up of radio surveys is inefficient .",
    "our goal is to eliminate the low redshift contamination through the inclusion of multi - wavelength information .",
    "we begin with the well known @xmath2 hubble relation for radio galaxies @xcite , which shows the strong correlation of @xmath1-band apparent magnitude and redshift .",
    "if we assume that this relation holds for all bright radio galaxies , then we can use model galaxy colors to predict the optical properties of these galaxies as they evolve .",
    "figure  [ simplerk ] shows the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 color - redshift diagrams for two sets of galaxy models generated with the spectral synthesis code _ pegase _ @xcite .",
    "the upper curves are color tracks for an instantaneous burst model at solar metallicity and assuming no extinction for formation redshifts of @xmath24 10 , 5 , and 3 , while the lower curves are for zero initial metallicity with an exponentially declining star - formation model with an @xmath25-folding time of @xmath26gyr and pegase `` spheroid '' type obscuration at these same formation redshifts .",
    "we choose solar metallicity for the instantaneous burst model to match the @xmath21 color of an elliptical galaxy at low redshift , as the pegase models do not update the metallicity in an instantaneous burst .",
    "metallicity does evolve in the models of ongoing star formation , hence the assumption of zero initial metallicity for the @xmath27gyr @xmath25-folding star formation model .",
    "although the spheroidal obscuration makes the ongoing star - formation model slightly redder than a typical elliptical galaxy at low redshift , we include it to approximate the effects of dust during the starburst ( i.e. pegase does not allow for the destruction of dust ) .",
    "we would expect this model to be accurate at high redshift , but too red at low redshift . since the low redshift models are excluded in both cases ,",
    "this is not a concern . shown for reference on each of the color redshift plots",
    "is the line representing the color of a point source at the @xmath28 limiting magnitude ( ab ) of the sdss filter ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) with the @xmath1-band magnitude assumed from a linear fit to the @xmath2 diagram , given by : @xmath32 , derived from a fit to the galaxies in @xcite .",
    "sources below the line on the diagram would be detected in each sdss band , while sources above would not .",
    "note that there will be some scatter in the cutoff due to the scatter in the @xmath2 hubble diagram .",
    "the exact nature of the objects passing the magnitude cut will depend on the color dependence of the scatter in th @xmath2 relation . combining the information in the @xmath2 diagram and figure  [ simplerk ]",
    "we see that all of the optically bright galaxies are either at low redshift , or galaxies very near their initial formation redshift .",
    "we can now use the optical properties of the radio galaxies to eliminate the low redshift component of the distribution .",
    "distribution of figure  [ dndz ] .",
    "the shaded histogram represents objects that pass our optical color cuts , assuming that all galaxies have a formation redshift @xmath33 .",

    "the shaded histogram represents the galaxies that pass our selection criteria , assuming that all galaxies have the colors of the solar metallicity instantaneous burst with @xmath34 .",
    "these histograms show that using optical properties is an effective way of screening out the low redshift component of the radio galaxy population .",
    "the pegase models predict that the radio galaxies get much bluer and brighter in the optical near their formation epoch due to the initial burst of star formation in the models .",
    "as the histogram in figure  [ moncarlodndz ] shows , some fraction of these galaxies will be excluded from optically selected samples near their formation epoch as they become bright and blue enough to be detected in most optical surveys .",
    "these model colors are especially sensitive to the assumptions made for the star formation ( e.g. obscuration , @xmath25-folding time ) , and it is difficult to infer how accurate these color tracks will be near the initial starburst .",
    "we also note that there is evidence for moderate obscuration in some high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , our models show that we may be somewhat biased against selecting unobscured galaxies with ongoing star formation near their formation epoch .",
    "lowering the optical magnitude cutoff would allow these galaxies to enter our sample , although at the expense of the low redshift cutoff .",
    "since we are primarily interested in galaxies with evolved stellar populations even at high redshift , as well as maintaining the efficiency of our search , we retain the optical selection to favor the low redshift cutoff at this minor expense of completeness .",
    "we begin with the 2003 april 11 version of the first catalog and select all sources with integrated flux @xmath35mjy .",
    "the primary motivation for this cut is to define a manageable sample size .",
    "flux limits as low as @xmath3610 mjy are reasonable for selecting high - redshift radio galaxies , and lower flux density limits will be explored in subsequent work .",
    "the @xmath37mjy objects are positionally cross matched with photometric data from sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ) , which covers more than 3300 square degrees .",
    "objects with candidate identifications in any of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath20 bands within a conservative radius of @xmath42 are excluded .",
    "radio sources with no cataloged sdss counterpart are visually inspected to further exclude possible low signal - to - noise optical counterparts , as well as identifying and excluding extended or multiple - lobe radio sources with an obvious optical counterpart located some distance from the cataloged radio position ( an optical source lying between independently cataloged radio lobes , for example ) .",
    "note that we are not restricted to unresolved radio sources : our selection criteria allow for extended and multicomponent radio sources to be included as well . to further eliminate likely low redshift sources , we optimally combine @xcite the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 sdss images ( the three most sensitive of the five sdss filters ) and eliminate any radio source with a candidate counterpart in the combined image .",
    "the @xmath28 point source limiting ab magnitudes for sdss are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xcite .",
    "the coadded @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 sdss images allow us to extend the low redshift range being excluded by , in essence , improving our magnitude threshold by @xmath48magnitude .",
    "this can be roughly thought of as providing an effective @xmath49 @xmath40-band magnitude limit of @xmath50 , although the specific limiting value is dependent on the details of individual target galaxy seds .",
    "coadded images are processed with _",
    "version 2.3.2 @xcite , and any objects with a detection greater than @xmath49 above the background are excluded from the sample .",
    "remaining target candidates are again visually inspected to eliminate new ( faint ) optical identifications of extended or multi - lobe radio sources .",
    "this visual inspection introduces some subjectivity into the target selection criteria , but it is necessary in order to eliminate obvious sdss counterparts to double lobed radio sources , and sources that are extended in the first catalog .",
    "candidate targets with nearby bright stars or other nearby bright confusing sources are also excluded from the final target list .",
    "these targets are then checked against the nasa extragalactic database ( _ ned _ ) to screen out objects that had previously been observed . only two objects , 4c @xmath5100.62 @xcite and",
