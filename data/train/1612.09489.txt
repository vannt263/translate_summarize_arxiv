    "in this paper we deal with a semi - infinite ( @xmath0 ) homogeneous and isotropic viscoelastic medium of density @xmath1 , which is assumed to be at rest for @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , the accessible extremum of the body ( defined by @xmath4 )",
    "is subjected to a perturbation denoted by @xmath5 . here , we are interested in the solution of the wave equation for the response function of the material @xmath6 . in the framework of a linear theory , this problem can be analyzed by working in either the creep or the relaxation representation .",

    "we fourther assume that the dynamics of the material is described in terms of a given bessel model of order @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it is worth remarking that the rate of creep is a completely monotonic function with a _ weak power law singularity _ as @xmath23 .    given this brief introduction to the bessel models of linear viscoelasticity , we have that the aim of this paper is to compute the response @xmath8 of the material for @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "first of all , let us summarize an important technique that allows us to compute the asymptotic wave - front expansions for _ singular _ viscoelastic models ( models that exibit a non - analytic creep compliance featured by power law singularities as @xmath23 ) .",

    "therefore , the discussion concerning the impulse response appears to be particularly relevant .",
    "indeed , an impulsive boundary condition represents a first rough approximation for the muscular pulse sent by the heart through arteries .",

    "moreover , the further away we put our observer from the edge of the artery , the stronger is the dumping of the peak of the pulse .",
    "it is quite known in the theory of laplace transform that , under fairly general conditions , the asymptotic behavior in the time domain is strictly related to the asymptotic behavior in the laplace domain . in particular , let @xmath135 be a suitable function in the time domain .",
    "then , denoting with @xmath136 the laplace transform of @xmath135 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath135 as @xmath26 is uniquely determined by the asymptotic expansion of @xmath136 as @xmath137 .",
