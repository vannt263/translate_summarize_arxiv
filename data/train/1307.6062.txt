    "single electron spins in quantum dots represent a suitable physical system for the experimental realization of quantum bits ( qubits ) @xcite .",
    "since single- and two - qubit operations are sufficient for implementing any arbitrary quantum gates @xcite , a large amount of research has been conducted for the realization of single qubit state control and two qubit operations @xcite . along with electrical control ,",
    "one of the possibilities to manipulate single electron spin state is by optical means @xcite , which offer a fast and coherent way for control of spin state in quantum dots .",
    "+ experimental achievements in optical initialization , read - out , coherent control and manipulations of single electron spins in quantum dots @xcite have reached a level at which their use for quantum information processing seems to be feasible .",
    "additionally optical control offers the possibility of incorporating electron spin qubits into hybrid systems in which the single spin state is entangled with the state of a photon and quantum information is transferred by photons @xcite . + the accomplishment of the essential steps for optimal optical single spin control is affected by different types of errors , e.g. imperfection of the applied laser pulses @xcite .",
    "mixing of heavy and light hole states influences the trion state , which is used in some schemes as an intermediate state @xcite .",
    "however , the mixing of the heavy and light holes in quantum dots can be controlled e.g. by means of anisotropic stress @xcite and in this way the errors created by the phenomena can be avoided . +",
    "another intrinsic mechanism causing decoherence of electron spins in iii - v semiconductor quantum dots is their interaction with the nuclear spins of the host material @xcite .",
    "an electron confined in such a quantum dot interacts by hyperfine coupling with a large nuclear bath ( roughly 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 nuclear spins per quantum dot ) .",
    "the total magnetic field of the nuclei , also called overhauser field , fluctuates randomly and acts as an effective magnetic field on the electron , causing dephasing of the electron spin state .",
    "there are possibilities to improve the decoherence time by reducing the fluctuations of the overhauser field .",
    "one such possibility is to polarize nuclear spins to a high degree @xcite , another is to drive or project the nuclear spin state into an eigenstate of the overhauser field operator @xcite . a significant improvement of electron spin coherence time was observed in the experiments , where nuclear spin fluctuations were suppressed by driving the nuclear field to a stable state @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we focus on the single spin rotation errors arising from the interaction with an unpolarized ensemble of nuclear spins .",
    "one possibility to rotate the single spin states in a quantum dot is by using raman transitions @xcite between single electron spin states split by magnetic field in voigt geometry via the trion state comprised of two electrons and a heavy hole . in this case",
    "the transitions are driven by specifically detuned laser pulses ( fig .",
    "[ level_scheme ] ) .",
    "the hyperfine interaction leads to a fluctuating spin state splitting and therefore to imperfect spin rotations .",
    "+ to compare the single spin rotations in the presence and in the absence of nuclear spins we compute the fidelities of the unitary time evolution of the electron spin state under the action of the laser light with and without including the hyperfine interaction .",
    "we average the obtained fidelities over the overhauser field distribution analytically to second order of the hyperfine coupling and numerically to an arbitrary order .",
    "we calculate the average fidelities for rotation axes parallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field and discuss the factors that influence the average rotation fidelities in both cases .",
    "+ the previous work on the performance of the two - qubit quantum operations in the presence of the hyperfine interaction showed that the fidelity depends on such conditions as the gradient of the nuclear fields between the two quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the fidelities of single - qubit rotations exposed the dependence on the relative orientation of the rotation axis relative to the external magnetic field .",
    "it was found that the dephasing time of the electron spin state differs if it is rotated around different axes .",
    "it would be interesting to confirm this observation for electron spin resonance on single spins in electrostatically defined or semiconductor nanowire quantum dots .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the mechanism of raman type optical transitions between single electron states . we include the hyperfine interaction to the system in section iii and derive the time evolution operator of the single - spin state in the presence of the overhauser field .",

    "the reduction of the average fidelity in this case is anticipated , since the rotation frequency @xmath77 is a quadratic function of both rabi frequencies and the reduction of these frequencies leads to smaller @xmath77 and thus to smaller fidelities .",
    "the average fidelity obtained analytically to second order of the overhauser field coincides with the numerically averaged fidelity for few full rotations around the @xmath9 axis and reproduces it on the nanosecond scale ( fig .",

    "however setting @xmath81 does not result in a rotation around an axis lying in the @xmath78 plane , if the electron spin interacts with the nuclear spins .",

    "the fidelity averaged over the nuclear spin distribution numerically to an arbitrary order and averaged analytically to the second order of the overhauser field @xmath84 is enhanced compared to the average fidelities in other cases presented in fig .",
    "the duration of a @xmath74 rotation reduces to 20 ps , while the average error for such rotation decreases to @xmath85 .",
    "this strong improvement in fidelity can not be explained only by increase of the interaction energy with the laser light @xmath77 . the increased average fidelity in the case , when @xmath72 is close to @xmath73 and vice versa can be attributed to the interplay of different contributions leading to a reduction of the average fidelity . as it can be seen in eq .",
    "the second term reduces the fidelity as @xmath86 and the third term as @xmath87 .",
    "when both rabi frequencies @xmath72 and @xmath73 are of roughly the same value , the fidelity reducing term @xmath86 becomes less relevant compared to the term @xmath88 .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",

    "the fidelity oscillations become dominated by the @xmath86 decay for longer interaction times ( fig .",

    "[ fpar](a ) shows the dependence of the average fidelity on the two rabi frequencies .",
    "the average fidelity increases as the rabi frequencies grow , since it increases the interaction energy @xmath77 and shortens the time needed to perform certain rotations .",
    "what is remarkable here is the strong enhancement of the fidelity ( up to unity ) in the region , where @xmath81 .",
    "this means that the average fidelity of a single spin rotation depends on the rotation axis in addition to the rotation frequency .",

    "the last expression describes the average fidelity to second order of hyperfine interaction for an electron spin interacting just with a static magnetic field and nuclear spins . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fpar](b ) , this fidelity increases for shorter interaction times .",
    "+ the behavior of the average fidelity for spin rotations at @xmath81 has a special character : it reaches unity when @xmath100 .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the overlap of two effects without nuclear spins this situation corresponds to a rotation around an axis in the @xmath78 plane , but with the hyperfine interaction there is an additional fluctuation of the rotation axis perpendicular to the @xmath78 plane . in the case of @xmath81",
    "these fluctuations average to zero .",
    "this leads to the result that only the off - diagonal elements of the time evolution operator are altered by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "but exactly this effect can not be captured by the fidelity , when @xmath100 , because in this case the ideal time evolution operator is the identity operator .",
    "consequently , the trace of the product of the time evolution operators , the ideal one and one with hyperfine interaction , does not contain the off - diagonal terms of the affected time evolution operator , which results in a perfect fidelity .",
    "this can also be seen in the dependence of the fidelity on the laser detuning in fig .",
    "[ fdet ] . for differing rabi frequencies the average fidelity reaches unity only once at @xmath101 , which corresponds to the situation when the optical stark shift compensates the effective magnetic field induced by nuclei , and then decays to a value given by @xmath102 . for equal rabi frequencies",
