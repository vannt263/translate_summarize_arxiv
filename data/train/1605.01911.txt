    "quantum electrodynamics in @xmath0 dimensions ( qed@xmath7 ) has been extensively studied during more than three decades now .",
    "originally , the interest in qed@xmath7 came from its similarities to ( @xmath8)-dimensional qcd and the fact that phenomena such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath9sb ) and mass generation may be studied systematically in such a toy model , see , _",

    ", the understanding of the phase structure of qed@xmath7 is a crucial pre - requisite to understand non - perturbative dynamic phenomena in more realistic particle and condensed matter physics models .    despite the fact that a large number of investigations have been carried out to study d@xmath9sb in qed@xmath7",
    ", very different results have been obtained . without being extensive ,",
    "let us indeed recall that , in his seminal paper  @xcite , pisarski solved the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) gap equation using a leading order ( lo ) @xmath2-expansion and found that a fermion mass is generated for all values of @xmath1 , decreasing exponentially with @xmath1 and vanishing only in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "later , he confirmed his finding by a renormalization group analysis .",
    "@xcite support of pisarski s result was given by pennington and collaborators  @xcite who adopted a more general non - perturbative approach to solving the sd equations .",
    "on the other hand , in a more refined analysis of the gap equation at lo of the @xmath2-expansion , appelquist et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the theory exhibits a critical behaviour as the number @xmath1 of fermion flavours approaches @xmath11 ; that is , a fermion mass is dynamically generated only for @xmath4 .",
    "contrary to all previous results , an alternative non - perturbative study by atkinson et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that chiral symmetry is unbroken at sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "the theory has also been simulated on the lattice .",
    "@xcite remarkably , the conclusions of ref .",
    "[ ] are in the agreement with the existence of a critical @xmath1 as predicted in the analysis of ref .",
    "[ ] while the second paper  @xcite finds d@xmath9sb for all @xmath1 and the recent third one  @xcite no sign of d@xmath9sb at all . even in the case",
    "where a finite @xmath3 is found , its value is subject to uncertainty with estimates ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , see ref .",

    "[ ] found that @xmath15 and ref .  [ ] that @xmath16 . clearly , all these disagreements reflect our poor understanding of this problem .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to include @xmath2 corrections to the lo result of ref .",
    "because the critical value @xmath3 is not large , the contribution of such higher orders in the @xmath2 expansion can be essential and their proper study may lead to a better understanding of the problem .",
    "this important issue has been rarely addressed in the past . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the main references are [ ] and [ ] where rather different results were obtained .",
    "the well - known results of ref .  [ ] demonstrated a quite strong stability of the @xmath2 expansion while the ones of ref .",
    "[ ] showed that a similar property holds only in the landau gauge .",

    ", we shall refine the analysis of ref .",
    "[ ] and perform an accurate computation of all @xmath2 corrections in the landau gauge , with a special focus on the most complicated ones , in order to extract the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the last years witnessed a strong progress in the study of the gauge dependence of d@xmath9sb in various models , see ref .",
    "[ ] as well as references and discussions therein .",
    "the progress is related to the use of the landau - khalatnikov - fradkin transformation .",
    "@xcite in the case of qed@xmath7 in the @xmath2-expansion , the application of this transformation  @xcite has revealed the almost complete lack of gauge dependence for @xmath3 .",
    "this confirms that we can limit our analysis to the case of the landau gauge .",
    "the lagrangian of massless qed@xmath7 with @xmath1 flavours of fermions reads l = ( i - e a ) - f _ ^2 , [ l - qed3 ] where @xmath17 is taken to be a four component complex spinor . in the massless case , which we are considering ,",
    "the model contains infrared divergences .",
    "the latter soften when the model is analysed in a @xmath2 expansion .",
    "@xcite since the theory is super - renormalizable , the mass scale is given by the dimensionful coupling constant : @xmath18 , which is kept fixed as @xmath19 .",
    "in the four component case , we can introduce the matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 which anticommute with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
