    "in a seminal paper , @xcite constructed a closed - box model of gas consumption and star formation that relies on the basic assumption of a polynomial relationship between ( total ) gas surface density @xmath9 and star formation rate surface density @xmath0 .",
    "this model was able to satisfy simultaneously a number of observational constraints , such as the initial luminosity function of main - sequence stars , the luminosity function of white dwarfs , or the relatively constant surface density of atomic hydrogen ( hi ) . while the first studies focussed on the relation between neutral hydrogen and sfr @xcite , the combination of measurements of h@xmath10 , hi and co emission lines allowed for a direct test of the schmidt relation , , and a precise measurement of its exponent @xcite .",
    "initially , it was assumed that @xmath9 would determine @xmath0 ( e.g. , via gravitational collapse ) .",
    "however , measurements of azimuthally averaged gas and sfr profiles showed that sfrs correlate better with the _ molecular _ hydrogen ( @xmath4 ) component than with the _ total _ gas density @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent observational and theoretical works demonstrate that the steepening of the relation at low gas surface densities coincides with the transition of atomic to molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the shape of the relation is also predicted to evolve strongly with redshift due to the build - up of metallicity in the interstellar medium ( ism ) over cosmic history and the importance of dust in the formation of @xmath4 and its shielding from lyman - werner radiation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the relation is often assumed to evolve little and be relatively insensitive to changes in metallicity and interstellar radiation field , although this has not yet been confirmed observationally .",
    "the assumption on which this `` universality '' is based is that the efficiency with which clouds of molecular hydrogen convert their @xmath4 into stars is not a strong function of the average ism metallicity or the interstellar radiation field , at least under conditions typical for spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the scale at which this conversion takes place is the scale of ( giant ) molecular clouds , i.e. , 100 pc or less .",
    "however , there are a couple of complications .",
    "first , there is growing observational evidence suggesting that the scatter in the relation increases if one goes to smaller and smaller scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "taken at face value , this seems to contradict a tight small - scale coupling between molecular hydrogen surface density and star formation .",
    "second , the relation is typically measured on @xmath2kpc scales and the spatial averaging may lead to changes in the slope , intercept and scatter compared with those on small scales @xcite .",
    "third , observationally determined sfrs are time - averaged over the effective lifetime of the specific star formation tracer and may thus differ from instantaneous sfrs .",
    "a straightforward observational check of the universality of the relation is difficult , first and foremost because the direct detection of molecular hydrogen is challenging .",
    "tracer molecules such as @xmath11 or hcn are typically used instead to infer the @xmath4 column density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mapping the line intensity of tracer molecules to the @xmath4 column density is obfuscated by the fact that the dependence of the conversion factor on ism properties , e.g. , metallicity or interstellar radiation field , is not well understood @xcite .",
    "in addition , radiative transfer effects need to be carefully modeled ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ccccc @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & resolution ( pc ) & no .",
    "+ & & & & + 50 & 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 & 0.1 , 1 , 10 , 100 & 65 & 12 + @xmath16 , @xmath17 & 1 & 0.1 & 65 & 2 + @xmath16 , @xmath17 & 0.1 & 100 & 65 & 2 + 50 & 1 & 1 & 32 & 1 + 50 & 1 & 1 & 125 & 1 +    numerical simulations offer a different route to studying the relation .",
    "what are their requirements ?",
    "first , the numerical code needs to follow self - consistently the formation and destruction of @xmath4 .",
    "this implies a resolution of 100 pc or better , an implementation of cooling down to a few tens of kelvin and , also , radiative transfer of the lyman - werner bands ( at least in some approximate form ) , in order to correctly capture the impact of the interstellar radiation field on the @xmath4 dissociation .",
    "secondly , the code needs a recipe for star formation .",
    "the accumulating evidence in favor of a universal initial stellar mass function @xcite indicates that star formation on small scales , i.e. , within star - forming clumps and cores within molecular clouds , is largely decoupled from the ism properties on larger scales .",
    "in particular , observations show that the average star formation efficiency per free - fall time is @xmath18 , independent of scale , once the densities of molecular clouds are reached ( e.g. , @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "a natural approach is therefore to couple the star formation on scales of individual molecular clouds directly to the density of molecular hydrogen , assuming that the formation and destruction of @xmath4 can be modeled reliably .",
    "consequently , the approach we use in our simulations is to relate the sfr to the @xmath4 density _ on small scales _",
    "( @xmath5 pc ) via the following equation @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the _ instantaneous _ sfr density , @xmath21 is the hydrogen mass density , @xmath22 is the @xmath4 fraction , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the star formation efficiency and the star formation time - scale ( see equation [ eq : tau ] below ) , respectively .",
    "the exponential factor models intrinsic scatter with width @xmath25 ( we discuss intrinsic scatter in  [ sect : scale ] , otherwise we assume @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath27 is a gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 .",
    "the factor @xmath28 ensures that the same amount of gas is converted into stars at a given @xmath4 density _ independent _ of the scatter width @xmath25 .",
    "this implies , however , that star formation efficiencies derived from the mean ( or median ) relation in the @xmath29 plane , i.e. , for @xmath30 , differ from the parameter @xmath31 by the factor @xmath28 .",
    "this effect should be considered when , e.g. , star formation efficiencies of scatter - free numerical simulations are calibrated against observations on sub - kpc scales .    on which grounds",
    "would we actually expect to see any dependence of slope , intercept and scatter of the relation on environmental parameters such as metallicity or interstellar radiation field ?",
    "the @xmath4 abundance is strongly affected by the amount of dust shielding from the uv radiation and , consequently , a lower metallically and/or larger radiation field will increase the required density for @xmath4 ( and consequently stars ) to form .",
    "we will show that a non - linear relation between @xmath32 and the sfr on small scales can have a significant impact on the slope , intercept , and scatter of the relation measured on large ( @xmath2 kpc ) scales .",
    "another important , and so far often neglected quantity , is the scatter in the relation .",
    "while some scatter may be due to observational measurement uncertainties , it is clear that any environmental dependence of the relation will translate into a galaxy - to - galaxy variation and , in combined data sets , to scatter .",
    "furthermore , the observed relation is measured on large scales ( spatial averaging ) using time - averaged sfrs .",
    "the averaging may induce a scale - dependence of the scatter .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : sims ] we briefly describe the setup of our numerical experiments .",
    "we then show in  [ sect : uvz ] the predicted dependence of the slope , intercept , and scatter of the relation on metallicity and interstellar radiation field .",
    "the scale dependence of the scatter and the propagation of intrinsic scatter from 100 pc to kpc scales is studied in  [ sect : scale ] .",
    "we discuss our findings in ",
    "[ sect : discussion ] and conclude in  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "a detailed description of the set of performed simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "all simulations are run with the eulerian hydrodynamics + @xmath33-body code art @xcite , which uses an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique to achieve high spatial resolution in the regions of interest ( here : regions of high baryonic density ) .",
    "first , we ran an initial cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation down to @xmath34 .",
    "this simulation follows a lagrangian region that encloses five virial radii of a typical @xmath35 galaxy ( halo mass @xmath36 @xmath6 at @xmath37 ) within a box of 6 comoving mpc/@xmath38 .",
    "the mass of dark - matter particles in the high - resolution lagrangian patch is @xmath39 and the spatial resolution is @xmath40 pc at @xmath41 in physical coordinates .",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "this initial , fully self - consistent simulation is consequently continued for additional @xmath47 myr before it is analyzed , but now with metallicities and uv fields fixed to a specific , spatially uniform value . at this time",
    ", the mass of the simulated halo is @xmath48 @xmath6 .",
    "we have run a grid of simulations with three different metallicities @xmath49 ( in units of @xmath50 ) and four different values of the interstellar radiation field @xmath51 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 specifies the strength of the interstellar radiation field in units of the radiation field of the milky way at 1000 : @xmath53 photons cm@xmath7 s@xmath55 ster@xmath55 ev@xmath55",
    ". we continued one of our simulations ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) for additional 400 myr and found no significant changes in the relation .",
    "this indicates that the predictions of our simulations should also hold for redshifts @xmath58 , at least unless / until ism properties change radically . in total",
    ", we ran a set of 18 simulations ( including 2 runs for a resolution study ) in order to explore the effect of varying metallicity , radiation field and density threshold on the relation ( see table [ tab : sims ] ) .",
    "the molecular hydrogen fraction @xmath22 is computed self - consistently , including a chemical network comprised of 6 species and radiative transfer of the uv continuum and the lyman - werner bands @xcite .",
    "if the average density in a simulation cell is smaller than the density typical for molecular clouds , we have to revert to a ` subgrid ' interpretation of the @xmath4 fraction . in this case , we assume that the fraction @xmath59 corresponds to the ( mass ) fraction of hydrogen in individual ( unresolved ) molecular clouds .",
    "as discussed in section [ sect : scale ] , the scatter in the relation decreases rather slowly ( @xmath60 ) with averaging scale @xmath61 , much slower than expected from a @xmath62 scaling , unless the gas is arranged in a 1d configuration .",
    "the scatter @xmath63 in the relation can be formally written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the spatial average of the star formation rate density and the brackets @xmath66 denote the ensemble average at _ fixed _ spatially averaged @xmath4 density @xmath67 .",
    "the star formation rate density @xmath68 is a random field and its value for a given point in space is defined by equation ( [ eq : sfr ] ) , i.e. , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and we assume that @xmath68 is proportional to the @xmath4 density , i.e. , @xmath71 is a constant . here",
    "@xmath27 is a gaussian random field with zero mean and unit variance .    from equations ( [ eq : sigsfr ] ) and ( [ eq : sfralt ] ) , it follows that @xmath72 on the scatter insertion scale @xmath73 , i.e. , without spatial averaging .",
    "the reason being that , in this case , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and thus @xmath77    equation ( [ eq : sigsfr ] ) can be solved if all cells have the same density @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in this case",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 if @xmath27 is spatially uncorrelated then @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85",
    ".    however , the scaling of @xmath86 may be different if x is spatially correlated , @xmath87 , or if the density pdf is not sharply peaked .",
    "we can test whether the latter , i.e. , the finite width of a log - normal density distribution , provides a quantitative explanation for the scaling of @xmath86 . to this end",
    ", we insert spatially uncorrelated scatter with @xmath88 on the scale of @xmath89 pc and compute @xmath86 as a function of averaging scale for log - normal density distributions of various widths @xmath90 and for a 1d , 2d and 3d configuration of @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , for each scale @xmath61 we first generate @xmath91 independent density values ( @xmath92 is the assumed dimensionality of the gas configuration ) drawn from a log - normal distribution with width @xmath90 and the same number of corresponding star formation rate density values according to equation ( [ eq : sfralt ] ) .",
    "we then compute the average @xmath4 density and sfr over the @xmath91 `` cells '' .",
    "this pair of spatially averaged @xmath4 density and star formation rate density constitutes a data point in the relation and the scatter of the relation is computed from 1000 data points generated in this way .",
    "[ fig : scalescattertest ] shows that if @xmath90 is sufficiently small ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath86 scales as @xmath62 as anticipated .",
    "supersonic turbulence simulations , however , predict @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath97 is a more reasonable assumption . in this case",
    ", @xmath86 scales approximately @xmath60 if the gas is arranged in a disk ."
