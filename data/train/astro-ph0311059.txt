    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is now a well known probe of the early universe .",
    "the temperature fluctuations in the cmb , especially the so - called acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , capture the physics of primordial photon - baryon fluid undergoing oscillations in the potential wells of dark matter ( hu et al .",
    "1997 ) . the associated physics  involving the evolution of a single photon - baryon fluid under compton scattering and gravity",
    " are both simple and linear , and many aspects of it have been discussed in the literature since the early 1970s ( peebles & yu 1970 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) . the gravitational redshift contribution at large angular scales ( e.g. , sachs & wolfe 1968 ) and the photon - diffusion damping at small angular scales ( e.g. , silk 1968 ) complete this description .    by now , the structure of the first few acoustic peaks is well studied with nasa s wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) mission ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , while in the long term , esa s planck surveyor , will extend this to a multipole of @xmath1 2000 with better frequency coverage . beyond temperature fluctuations , detections of the polarization anisotropy , related to density or scalar perturbations ,",
    "have now been made by the dasi experiment ( kovac et al .",
    "2003 ) , followed up with an improved study of the temperature - polarization power spectrum with wmap ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "an interesting result from wmap data is related to the very large angular scale polarization signal , which probes the local universe and associated astrophysics instead of physics at the last scattering surface probed with polarization at tens of arcminute scales .",
    "this local universe contribution arises when the universe reionizes again and the temperature quadrupole begins to rescatter to produce a new contribution to the polarization anisotropy at angular scales corresponding to the horizon at the new scattering surface ( zaldarriaga 1997 ) .",
    "such a signal was measured in the wmap temperature - polarization cross - correlation power spectrum and was interpreted as rescattering with an optical depth to electron scattering , inferred from the amplitude of the large angular scale cmb polarization , of @xmath2 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "such an optical depth suggests early reionization ; for example , if the universe reionized completely and instantaneously at some redshift , the measured optical depth suggests a reionization redshift of @xmath1 17 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "such a high optical depth , in the presence of a @xmath4 1% neutral hydrogen fraction from z @xmath1 6 sloan quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggests a complex reionization history .",
    "a complex , and patchy , reionization , however , is expected if the reionization is dominated by the uv light from first luminous objects , though to explain the high level of the wmap s optical depth requires high star formation efficiency at redshifts of order 25 with a possibility for a population of metal - free massive pop iii stars ( e.g. , cen 2003 ) .    in general",
    ", one can only extract limited information related to the reionization history from polarization peak at tens of degrees or more angular scales ( e.g. , hu & holder 2003 ) . one reason for this is the large cosmic variance associated with measurements at multipoles of @xmath1 10 . to extract detailed information of the reionization process",
    ", one can move to temperature fluctuations generated during the reionization era at angular scales corresponding to few arcminutes and below . at these small angular scales ,",
    "potentially interesting contributions from high redshifts include a scattering contribution related to moving electrons in ionized patches and fluctuations in the moving electron population ( e.g. , santos et al .",
    "2003 ) , and a thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect , just as in massive galaxy clusters containing hot electrons ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ) , related to the first supernovae bubbles ( oh et al .",
    "the same redshift ranges are expected to be illuminated in the near - infrared band between 1 to 3 @xmath5 m in the form of spatial fluctuations to the cosmic ir background ( cooray et al .",
    "potentially interesting studies to extract more information related to the reionization process include cross - correlation studies between these small scale effects in cmb as well as other wavelengths .",
    "upcoming experiments such as the south pole telescope and the atacama cosmology telescope will provide some of the first possibilties in this direction .",
    "though acoustic oscillations in the temperature anisotropies of cmb suggest an inflationary origin for primordial perturbations , it has been argued for a while that the smoking - gun signature for inflation would be the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( e.g. , kamionkowski & kosowsky 1999 ) .",
    "these gravitational - waves produce a distinct signature in the cmb in the form of a contribution to the curl , or magnetic - like , component of the polarization ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1997 ; seljak & zaldarriaga 1997 ) .",
    "note that there is no contribution from the dominant scalar , or density - perturbation , contribution to these curl modes .    in figure  1",
    ", we show the contribution from dominant scalar modes to the polarization in the gradient component and from gravitational - waves to the curl polarization .",
    "note that the amplitude of the igb contribution is highly unknown and simply depends on the energy scale of the inflation .",
    "the current limit from cmb anisotropy data suggests an upper limit of order @xmath6 gev ( melchiorri & odman 2003 ) .",
    "an important issue related to potential detectability of the curl - modes related to gravity waves is the peak of its contribution ; if the universe did not reionize , the peak of the contribution is at the multipoles of @xmath1 100 corresponding to the contribution generated at the recombination . on the other hand , in the presence of a reionization",
    ", the rescattering adds extra power at large angular scales . for optical depths of order 0.17 , as estimated by wmap , the peak is now at tens or more degree scales .",
    "this substantial increase in the amplitude aids potential detection of the curl modes and to a large extent will determine the observational details of a post - wmap mission .",
    "for example , if a substantial reionization exists , one can target the large angular scale polarization with a poor resolution experiment .",
    "if instrumental noise sensitivities can be substantially improved it may be better to target both reionized contribution at large angular scales and the recombination contribution at small angular scales to substantially improve the limiting amplitude of the igb .",
    "for this , a major source of concern is the confusion from effects that generate curl - modes and not associated with the igb .    among these",
    ", the few percent conversion of e to b from cosmic shear modification to the polarization pattern by the intervening large scale structure is important ( zaldarriaga & seljak 1998 ) .",
    "these lensing - induced curl modes introduce a noise from which gravitational waves must be distinguished in the cmb polarization .",
    "we now discuss this contribution and how it can be reduced by performing weak lensing studies in high resolution cmb temperature and polarization maps .    *",
    "weak gravitational lensing with cmb : * gravitational lensing of the cmb photons by the mass fluctuations in the large - scale structure is now well understood ( hu 2001 ) .",
    "since the lensing effect involves the angular gradient of cmb photons and leaves the surface brightness unaffected , its signatures are at the second order in temperature . effectively , lensing smooths the acoustic peak structure at large angular scales and moves photons to small scales .",
    "when the cmb gradient at small angular scales are lensed by foreground structures such as galaxy clusters , new anisotropies are generated at arcminute scales .",
    "for favorable cosmologies , the mean gradient is of order @xmath1 15 @xmath5k arcmin@xmath7 and with deflection angles or order 0.5 arcmin or so from massive clusters , the lensing effect results in temperature fluctuations of order @xmath1 5 to 10 @xmath5k .",
    "one can effectively extract this lensing contribution , and the integrated dark matter density field responsible for the lensing effect , via quadratic statistics in the temperature and the polarization ( hu 2001 ; hu & okamoto 2003 ; cooray & kesden 2003 ; kesden et al 2003 ) or likelihood - based techniques that are optimized for lensing extraction ( hirata & seljak 2003 ) .",
    "we show errors for a construction of convergence from cmb temperature , with arcminute - scale angular resolution , in figure  4 and a comparison to what can be achieved with weak lensing studies involving galaxy shapes .",
    "note that one probes linear clustering with cmb while most sensitive measurements at low redshifts , with galaxy shear measurements , are in the non - linear regime .",
    "this makes a big difference in terms of cosmological parameter extraction since the uncertainty related to understanding non - linear clustering properties , in the presence of a dark energy or massive neutrino , will limit the extent to which one can extract information from low redshift lensing surveys . on the other hand , we suggest the importance of combining the two : cmb , with a source at z @xmath1 1100 , and galaxy surveys , with sources at @xmath8 , probe complimentary information and the evolution of dark matter clustering between the two redshift ranges .    when considering the effect of a lensing confusion to igb detection , it is desirable to make use of cmb data for a lensing reconstruction .",
    "this is due to the fact that what one extract from galaxy shape measurements out to a redshift of a few , at most , only leads to a partial accounting of the total effect ( the difference in curves in figure  4 ) . by mapping lensing deflection from cmb data , the lensing effect on polarization",
    "can be corrected to reconstruct the intrinsic cmb polarization at the surface of last scattering .",
    "now the only curl component would be that due to gravity waves . in figure  1 , we show how well the lensing signal can be extracted . with no noise all - sky maps , and using quadratic statistics , one can remove the lensing contribution with a noise contribution that is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the original confusion . the extent to which the igb amplitude limit , in terms of the energy scale of inflation ,",
    "can be improved in the presence of cosmic shear confusion is summarized in fig .  2 for a 1 @xmath5k @xmath9 sensitivity experiment ,",
    "while in fig .  3",
    ", we consider the same for a @xmath1 25 @xmath5k @xmath9 sensitivity experiment with resolution similar to planck .",
    "following kesden et al .",
    "( 2002 ; knox & song 2002 ) , if there is no instrumental - noise limitation , the sensitivity to gravity - wave signal is maximized by covering as much sky as possible and allow the accessibility to an inflaton potential of @xmath10 gev .",
    "this limit is slightly improved with likelihood techniques which extract additional information beyond quadratic statistics ( seljak & hirata 2003 ) .",
    "if the optical depth is to be high at the level of 0.1 , then limits at the same level or slightly worse can be achieved by targeting the degree scale peak with a poor resolution experiment with no need for a removal of the confusion related to cosmic shear .",
    "thus , in conclusion , we iterate the importance of reionization and we suggest that an improved measurement of the optical depth will be helpful to optimize a post - wmap mission related to the igb detection as part of nasa s einstein probes program .    _",
