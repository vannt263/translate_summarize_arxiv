    "the rest frame positions of various lines are marked above the spectrum .",
    "lines marked below the spectrum designate various absorption lines originating in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "all ism lines detected here are typically seen in fos spectra of quasars .",
    "we made no attempt to identify the many fe  ii emission blends present .",
    "the various fe  ii multiplets designated in fig.2 are taken from moore ( 1952 ) , and serve only as an illustration of possible fe  ii features .",
    "the number of possible fe  ii multiplets is extremely large , and a reliable identification requires detailed theoretical calculations . the complete spectrum , and the measured emission line parameters are provided in laor et al .",

    "[ [ c ] ] c ~    the [ c  iii ]  @xmath8 line may be present in .",

    "the @xmath9 term lies 0.007  ev above the @xmath12 term which produces the well known c  iii]@xmath13 line , where @xmath14  .",
    "thus , the flux ratio @xmath15[c  iii ]  @xmath16c  iii]@xmath13 provides a temperature independent density diagnostic ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 , fig .",

    "1995 ; wills et al .",
    "since c  iii]@xmath13 is thermalized at @xmath21  , the suppression of c  iii]@xmath13 may imply that the typical blr density in  is about an order of magnitude larger than indicated by c  iii]@xmath13 in typical agns , i.e. @xmath22  instead of @xmath23  .",
    "additional evidence for this interpretation is provided by the si  iii]@xmath24 line discussed below .",
    "[ [ mg ] ] mg ~~    the mg  ii ion survives mostly in the partially ionized h region , where photons above 13.6  ev are blocked .",

    "the flux ratio of the mg  ii 2796.35  /2803.53    components indicates the optical depth in the line .",
    "the 2803.53   , 2796.35    lines correspond to transitions from the @xmath26 and @xmath27 levels to the ground @xmath28 level .",
    "collisional de - excitation dominates when @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the line center optical depth for resonance scattering , i.e when @xmath31  @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xmath32 for the @xmath27 and @xmath26 levels . for @xmath31",
    "@xmath32 the mg  ii 2796.35  /2803.53    doublet ratio is thermalized , i.e. it changes from 2/1 to 1/1 ( see hamann et al .",

    "thus , the observed 1.2/1 ratio implies that most of the mg  ii emission is produced in a region where @xmath34  @xmath32 .",
    "as described in laor et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , the value of @xmath35 provides a direct measure of the distance of the blr clouds from the central ionizing continuum source .",
    "the line center optical depth is @xmath36 , where @xmath37  @xmath38 is the total mg  ii doublet line center absorption cross section ( for @xmath39  k ) , and @xmath40 is the column density of mg  ii ions .",

    "balmer continuum absorption may limit the depth of the mg  ii doublet emitting layer , but this absorption will not affect our conclusion . using the mg / h solar abundance ratio of @xmath44 , and assuming most mg is mg  ii , we get @xmath45  , or @xmath46 , assuming the gas is ionization , rather than matter bounded . the mg  ii doublet is therefore thermalized when @xmath47 , or @xmath48  , which is consistent with the standard estimate of @xmath49  in the blr .    [",
    "[ al ] ] al ~~    the components of the al  iii  @xmath1 doublet are widely spaced ( @xmath50 ) and are therefore clearly resolved in .",
    "al  iii is created by photons above 18.829  ev , and destroyed by photons above 28.448  ev , thus unlike mg  ii , it exists in the highly ionized h region only , and the observed al  iii doublet ratio provides constraints on the blr h  ii region , as discussed below .    the template fit suggests a 1.25/1 ratio for the 1854.71  /1862.79    doublet line .",
    "baldwin et al . ( 1996 ) found a similar 1/1 flux ratio in three objects where the al  iii doublet was clearly detected .",
    "the al  iii and mg  ii ions are both na  i like . using the same reasoning described for mg  ii we find that the al  iii  @xmath1 doublet is thermalized for @xmath51  , and the observed 1.25/1 doublet ratio indicates that it is formed in clouds at , or inside the ` standard ' blr radius of @xmath52  pc , where @xmath53  .",
    "the relatively large al  iii  @xmath1 ew ( 4.4   ) requires a blr component where al  iii is the dominant ionization state of al , which occurs for @xmath54 ( e.g. baldwin et al . 1996 , fig.7a ) . since @xmath51  , the above range in @xmath42 implies @xmath55  , which is comparable , or denser , than the component responsible for the c  iii ]  @xmath0 emission .",

    "the flux of the si  ii @xmath56 and @xmath57 blends is well constrained .",
    "this wealth of data provides a unique opportunity to explore the si  ii line formation mechanisms ( e.g. baldwin et al .",

    "the outer shell electronic configuration of the si  iii ion is analogous to that of c  iii .",
    "the analogous line to the [ c  iii ]  @xmath8 line is the [ si  iii ]  @xmath58 line , which can also be used as a density diagnostic for the si  iii gas .",
    "weak [ si iii ]  @xmath58 emission may be present at 1881.1   .",
    "as for the c  iii ion , the @xmath59  [ si  iii ]  @xmath60si  iii ]  @xmath61 flux ratio is a robust density indicator .",
    "the observed @xmath62 implies that some of the si  iii resides in gas with @xmath63  , i.e. the same conditions implied by @xmath64 , as expected since the spatial distribution of both ions in photoionized gas should largely overlap .",
    "the si  iii ]  @xmath61/c  iii ]  @xmath0 flux ratio of @xmath65 is significantly larger than the typical ratio of @xmath66 observed in quasars ( laor et al .",
    "this high ratio results from the factor of 5 - 10 suppression in the c  iii ]  @xmath0 flux , rather than significant enhancement of si  iii ]  @xmath61 .",
    "the most likely interpretation for this high ratio is a relatively dense blr .",
    "the critical density for c  iii ]  @xmath0 , @xmath14  , is significantly smaller than for si  iii ]  @xmath61 , where @xmath67  .",

    "[ [ fe ] ] fe ~~    the likely presence of fe  ii emission well below 2000   , and possibly even at @xmath71 - 1130   , indicates that fe  ii is excited by processes other than just collisions , as the electron temperature in the fe  ii region is most likely far too low for significant collisional excitation of levels @xmath72  ev above the ground state .",
    "one such process , suggested by penston ( 1987 ) , is resonance absorption of photons by fe  ii .",
    "johansson & jordan ( 1984 ) found   resonance absorption to be significant in various stellar systems , and identified the fe  ii  @xmath73 , fe  ii  uv  191  @xmath74 , and the fe  ii  @xmath75 multiplets as the signatures of such a process .",
    "the fe  ii  uv  191 multiplet is very prominent in , and weak emission blends are clearly apparent at 1294   , and 1870   , suggesting that resonance absorption of  photons may be a significant excitation mechanism for fe  ii in  as well .",
    "resonance scattering of continuum photons , and fe  ii - fe  ii line flouresence could also be a significant process for populating high lying fe  ii levels ( e.g. netzer & wills 1983 ; wills , netzer & wills 1985 ) .",
    "clearly , the fe  ii rich spectrum of  should serve as a valuable tool for future studies of fe  ii emission in agns .    a number of fe  iii multiplets are clearly present .",
    "the fe  iii  uv  34 multiplet , clearly identified here , was first discovered by hartig & baldwin ( 1986 ) in a broad absorption line quasar .",
    "an emission feature near @xmath76  is commonly seen in quasars ( e.g. wills et al .",
    "1980 ) , and was identified as a likely fe  ii blend .",
    "baldwin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that this feature is due to fe  iii  uv  48 emission .",
    "here the three fe  iii  uv  48 components at 2062.2   , 2068.9   , and 2079.65  are clearly resolved , which verifies the identity of this feature .",
    "the fe  iii  uv  47  @xmath77 doublet is most likely present as well .",
    "other fe  iii blends , such as fe  iii  uv  50 and fe  iii  uv  68 , and in particular the resonance fe  iii  uv  1 at 1122 - 1130     may also be present , but these identifications can not be verified here since these blends are not clearly resolved",
    ".    the relative flux ratio of the multiplet components can provide an important diagnostic for the optical depth and excitation mechanism of fe  iii .",
    "optical spectra of  revealed two velocity systems .",
    "the first system is at @xmath7 for the low ionization forbidden lines and balmer lines , including , , optical fe  ii multiplets , [ ca  ii ] , [ s  ii ] , [ n  ii ] , he  i , na  i , and [ o  i ] .",
    "the second system is at @xmath78 ( i.e. blueshifted by @xmath79  ) for the higher ionization forbidden lines , [ o  iii ] and [ ne  iii ] ( phillips 1976 , oke & lauer 1979 ) .",
    "we find the same trend in the uv .",
    "the low ionization permitted lines , including o  i , c  ii , c  ii ] , n  ii ] , al  ii , al  ii ] , the various si  ii multiplets , and fe  ii  191 are all blueshifted by @xmath80  with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "higher ionization lines , including n  iii ] , al  iii , si  iii ] and si  iv are blueshifted by @xmath81 , while the highest ionization lines , c  iv and n  v , are blueshifted by @xmath82 .",
    "the highest blueshift , @xmath83 , is displayed by he  ii  @xmath84 .",
    "this trend of increasing blueshift with increasing ionization level is observed in most quasars ( e.g. gaskell 1982 ; wilkes 1984 , 1986 ; espey et al .",
    "however , the typical amplitude of the high ionization line blueshift , such as c  iv and n  v , is only @xmath85 , and for he  ii it is @xmath86  ( tytler & fan 1992 ; laor et al .",
    "1995 ) , i.e. about four times lower than found in .",
    "the low ionization line profiles are mostly consistent with the rather symmetric  profile .",
    "with increasing blueshift the lines get progressively broader and develop a progressively stronger blue excess asymmetry ( fig.3 in laor et al .",
    "associated absorption is present in , n  v , c  iv and si  iv .",
    "the absorption is blueshifted by @xmath87  relative to the @xmath7 frame , it has a fwhm@xmath88 , and an absorption ew of @xmath89    for most lines . since the spectral resolution of the fos is @xmath90 , the absorption system may not be truly resolved .",
    "the presence of high ionization lines , and lack of low ionization lines in absorption suggests the absorber is associated with , rather than with an intervening system unrelated to  ( see e.g. hamann 1997 ) .",
    "most of the constraints below are independent of the exact location of the absorber .",
    "the column density associated with the observed absorption is a function of the absorber optical depth ( assuming a full coverage ) .",
    "the optical depth can be deduced from the ratio of ew of the two doublet components . the observed ratio in n  v is @xmath91 , but it is rather uncertain , and thus the absorption optical depth remains uncertain .",
    "the absorbing columns are in the range @xmath92  @xmath93 , @xmath94  @xmath93 , and @xmath95  @xmath93 .    to infer the total h column density from the h  i column density one needs to know the h ionization state .",
    "the h  ii / h  i fraction in the absorbing gas is related to the ionization parameter through @xmath96 ( e.g. netzer 1990 ) .",
    "thus , the upper limit on the h column density is @xmath97 .",
    "the presence of n  v and c  iv ions suggests that the absorber has @xmath98 , thus the h column density upper limit is probably in the range @xmath99 .",
    "if the absorber metal abundance is solar then the above @xmath100 implies metal columns upper limits of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these values overlap with the directly determined constraints on the c  iv and n  v columns and suggests that significant fractions of c and n may indeed be in the form of c  iv and n  v , consistent with the assumption of @xmath98 .",
    "detection of o  vi  @xmath103 absorption would allow a much tighter constraint on the absorber s @xmath42 .",
    "the uv absorber blueshift of @xmath87  is remarkably close to the he  ii  @xmath104 emission line blueshift of @xmath105 , suggesting that the strongly blueshifted he  ii emission line peak may originate in the same outflowing gas which produces the uv absorption lines . in order to emit the",
    "observed he  ii  @xmath104 flux the absorber must absorb most photons just above the he  ii bound - free edge at 4  rydberg .",
    "if the column density of the uv absorber is close to the upper limit , and its covering factor is close to unity , it may contribute significantly to the observed he  ii  @xmath104 emission .",
    "the strong optical fe  ii emission of , its weak [ o  iii ] emission , strong ir emission , and `` red '' uv continuum are all typical properties of low ionization broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ; weymann et al .",
    "1991 , boroson & meyers 1992 ; sprayberry & foltz 1992 ) .",
    "the presence of weak uv absorption at a blueshift of @xmath83   in  suggests it may be a `` failed '' low ionization balqso , i.e. a balqso where our line of sight just grazes the outflowing high ionization wind , and misses the low ionization outflow , as suggested by turnshek et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the case of pg  0043 + 039 .    is the red continuum , excess blue flux in the high ionization lines , associated absorption , and dense blr , unique to , or are they typical uv properties of narrow line quasars ?",
    "no complete uv study of narrow line agns is available to answer these questions , but some hints may be obtained from existing observations .",
    "baldwin et al . ( 1996 ) studied the emission line properties of a heterogeneous sample of seven @xmath106 quasars with a range of emission line properties .",
    "some of their objects have strong fe  ii , fe  iii , and al  iii emission as observed in .",
    "baldwin et al . analyzed in detail the uv spectrum of q@xmath107 , where a high s / n ratio was available , and found excess emission in the blue wing of the high ionization uv lines , which they interpreted as a high ionization outflowing component in the blr ,",
    "although there was no direct evidence ( through absorption ) for such a component , as observed in .",
    "it is also interesting to note that boroson & green found that strong optical fe  ii emitting quasars , which tend to have narrow , also tend to have blue excess flux in , and boroson & meyers found that low ionization balqsos , which are generally  like , have blue excess flux in .",
    "it is not known , however , whether this property extends to the uv lines as well .",
    "if the uv absorption system in  is indeed producing the blueshifted components of the high ionization lines , then the absence of a corresponding redshifted component indicates that the far side of this outflow has to be obscured .",
    "this may either be due to an extended highly optically thick gas , such as an accretion disk , or it may result from absorption within each cloud , if the clouds column density is large enough ( see ferland et al .",
    "1992 for discussion ) .",
    "has particularly weak c  iii ]  @xmath108 emission but normal si  iii ]  @xmath109 emission , which we interpret here as evidence for a relatively dense ( @xmath110  ) blr , at least for the region which produces the low ionization lines .",
    "baldwin et al . ( 1988 ) noted the weakness of c  iii ]  @xmath108 in four other quasars with narrow uv lines , and this trend is also apparent in baldwin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) quasars .",
    "the most extreme case is of h@xmath111 where essentially no c  iii ]  @xmath108 emission was observed ( hartig & baldwin 1986 ) .",
    "this quasar has very narrow lines , and is also a low ionization balqso .    independent evidence for a dense blr with @xmath112  is provided by the significant ew and thermalized doublet ratio of the al  iii  @xmath1 doublet , and by the significant ew of c  iii@xmath113 .",
    "another indication for a dense blr in  is provided by its optical spectrum .",
    "the na  i  @xmath114 emission line is rather strong ( oke & lauer 1979 ; phillips 1976 ) , which thompson ( 1991 ) and korista et al .",
    "( 1997 , their figure 3 g ) find can only be produced for @xmath112  , and a large column density ( required to shield neutral na  i from ionizing radiation at @xmath115  ev ) .",
    "it thus appears that some of the properties of , in particular the relatively weak c  iii ]  @xmath108 , and the blueshifted excess emission in the high ionization lines , may be common in narrow line quasars . a more systematic study of the uv emission of narrow line agns is required to establish their typical emission line properties , their relation to low ionization balqsos , and to eventually understand the underlying physics . a first step in this direction",
