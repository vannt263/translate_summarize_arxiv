    "nearly fifteen years of observations with photometry and low - dispersion spectroscopy ( lds ) have significantly advanced our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the hubble wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) has produced robust and repeatable observations , resulting in physically sensible atmospheric composition interpretations .",
    "its band around 1.4  has a strong diagnostic power since it targets major sources of opacity for exoplanet atmospheres ( primarily h@xmath3o , but also ch@xmath4 , hcn , and nh@xmath5 ) .",
    "the interpretation of lds data is also supported by state - of - the art retrieval algorithms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when multiple species overlap , however , ambiguities arise in molecular identification and abundance determinations .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopy ( hds ) from the ground has recently emerged as an additional tool to characterize exoplanet atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hds is able to distinctly determine the presence of specific molecular species , despite overlap . for emission spectra , absorption and emission",
    "are intrinsically discriminated , allowing the direct detection of thermal inversion layers . due to the large opacity difference between the core and the wings of molecular lines",
    ", hds probes a broad range in atmospheric temperatures and pressures .",
    "however , retrieving atmospheric properties ( especially absolute molecular abundances ) from hds data is challenging .",
    "this is partly due to the loss of the planet+star continuum from self - calibration of the data , and additionally to the lack of robust retrieval algorithms .",
    "inference in hds data analysis is naturally done through forward modeling , since atmospheric signatures are searched by cross - correlating with template spectra , which combines the signal of tens or hundreds of molecular lines . not only is this process computationally cumbersome , but also the statistical properties of the resulting cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) are far from trivial .    in this paper",
    "we present a novel analysis technique to combine the strengths of high - resolution and low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we demonstrate the method on dayside spectroscopic observations of the hot jupiter hd  209458  b  @xcite .",
    "as one of the best - characterized transiting exoplanets , it is the ideal target for testing our new method .",
    "we aim to show that , when combining lds and hds , the sensitivity to a wider range in atmospheric pressures and the ability of hds to disentangle overlapping molecular features can significantly improve the inference of the chemical compositions of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "the lds dataset used for this work is described in @xcite and shown in figure  [ fig : lds_hds ] .",
    "it consists of eclipse observations of hd  209458  b  obtained with hubble / wfc3 in the range 1.125 - 1.655 , and with spitzer / irac at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  from @xcite .",
    "the hds data consist of two half nights of dayside spectra taken with vlt / crires in the range 2.287 - 2.345  at a resolution of 100,000 , and are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we only include the nodded observations ( 2 out of 3 sets of data ) for which we have a good understanding of the instrument .",
    "we utilize the same calibrated and extracted spectra as @xcite , but one important difference in our current analysis is that we also estimate the weight of each crires detector based on the injection and retrieval of an artificial signal .",
    "this is the best - fitting , co - only model spectrum of @xcite , scaled via @xmath6 where @xmath7  and @xmath8  are the planet and stellar radii , respectively , and @xmath9 is the planck function at temperature @xmath10 k , which matches the continuum of hd 209458 around 2.3  .",
    "the scaled model is doppler - shifted to the planet radial velocity computed with a semi - amplitude of @xmath11  =  ( @xmath12 )  km  s@xmath13 , i.e. , the value obtained from the literature @xcite , assuming a circular orbit .",
    "the scaled and shifted model is injected in the data at 5@xmath0 the nominal level via @xmath14,\\ ] ] a scaling factor of 5 is the minimum required to achieve a s / n@xmath153 in all of the four detectors . the model is injected as early as possible in the analysis , i.e. , after the spectra are aligned to the common telluric reference frame .",
    "we then remove telluric lines and cross correlate the residual spectra with the model as in @xcite .",
    "the injected artificial signal is retrieved by co - adding the ccfs from each night and each crires detector at the planet radial velocity .",
    "we find that all four crires detectors contain significant signal , but their relative weight differs between nights and between detectors , possibly due to varying observing conditions and the unequal density of co spectral lines with wavelength . when weighting the ccfs between the observed spectra and the model by the square of the measured artificial s / n ( i.e. , the peak value of the ccf divided by the r.m.s .",
    "of the noise ) , the tentative detection of @xcite becomes a solid detection of co in absorption at s / n=5.3 .",
    "we do not proceed to explore the full model grid of @xcite at this stage , but we utilize the weighting and the analysis described above to test a novel retrieval method .",
    "our aim is to combine the complementary information from lds and hds and compute a joint posterior distribution .",
    "lds data can be compared to models in a straightforward manner ( e.g. , via `` chi - square '' ) , whereas the signal in hds data is extracted by cross - correlating with a family of models .",
    "we thus need to define an appropriate metric for quantifying the fit quality of a model to hds data .",
    "since comparing models via cross correlation is computationally expensive , we also need to design an efficient exploration of the parameter space .",
    "the cross - correlation function between the data and a model is maximized when both the position and the strength of spectral lines _ relative _ to each other match . however , due to invariance under scaling , maximizing the cross - correlation signal is not equivalent to matching the _ absolute _ line - to - continuum contrast .",
    "this additional constraint can be fulfilled by minimizing the residual cross - correlation signal when each model is subtracted from the data . in other words ,",
    "the best - fitting model will maximize the cross correlation with the observed spectra and minimize the cross correlation with the model - subtracted data .",
    "these two requirements are incorporated into a consistent statistical framework adapted from @xcite :    * the model is directly cross - correlated with the data after telluric lines are removed .",
    "no match would produce a distribution of cross - correlation values consistent with random noise , i.e. , with a flat line .",
    "the deviation from a flat line therefore indicates that a signal of some kind is detected .",
    "this is quantified by computing the @xmath16 of the cross correlation values around the planet radial velocity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the probability of measuring @xmath17 given @xmath18 degrees of freedom @xmath19 is computed and translated into a sigma value @xmath20 for a normal distribution with a two - tail test .",
    "a range of planet radial - velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath11  within 4@xmath1 from the literature value is explored ; * the model is scaled to the observed planet / star flux ratio based on eq .",
    "[ eq : scaling ] , doppler shifted based on the same range of @xmath11  indicated above , and subtracted from the data via eq .",
    "[ eq : scale ] , with scaling factor @xmath21 .",
    "telluric lines are again removed and the residuals cross correlated with the model . a perfect match between the planet signal and",
    "the scaled model will result in a perfect subtraction .",
    "therefore the cross - correlation function of the residuals will be consistent with random noise , which means its sigma value @xmath22 computed as above from the chi square @xmath23 of cross - correlation values will be approximately zero ; * the best - fitting model is found by maximizing the difference @xmath24 . in this study",
    "this is equivalent to maximizing the @xmath25 , but this formulation is more general , as it allows us to test additional parameters when subtracting the model , e.g. , line broadening due to rotation as in @xcite .",
    "it only requires adjusting the degrees of freedom @xmath18 when computing @xmath26 .",
    "the algorithm outlined in section  [ sec : hds_metric ] runs in approximately 4 minutes per model on a single core of a modern unix machine .",
    "it is therefore computationally too expensive to run a full mcmc for the hds data that would include 10@xmath27 - 10@xmath28 models .",
    "however , since our final goal is to produce the _ joint _ posterior distribution of lds and hds data combined , we can neglect regions of the parameter space which are already strongly disfavored by the lds analysis .",
    "this is done by feeding the hds analysis with a set of models sampled from the lds posterior distribution of @xcite .",
    "the parametrization consists of molecular abundances for 7 species ( co , h@xmath3o , ch@xmath4 , co@xmath3 , c@xmath3h@xmath3 , nh@xmath5 , hcn ) and five additional parameters to sample the temperature - pressure profile as in @xcite .",
    "the 12-dimensional lds posterior is sampled with 5,000 points , and the corresponding high - resolution , disk - integrated emission spectra are computed via line - by - line radiative - transfer calculations with the chimera @xcite emission forward model .",
    "examples of lds and hds model spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : lds_hds ] .",
    "we use the absorption cross - section database ( and references there - in ) from @xcite with subsequent upgrades described in @xcite .",
    "the database comprises pre - computed cross - sections on a grid of temperature and pressure points sampled at intervals of 0.01 cm@xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to a resolution @xmath30 , enough to resolve the individual lines ( e.g. , resolve the half - widths ) at the crires wavelengths over the physically relevant ranges of temperatures and pressures ) tabulated cross - sections computed with the hitran hapi module and the hitemp database , and found negligible differences between the lines sampled at 0.01 cm@xmath13 and 0.001 cm@xmath13 grid resolutions . ] .",
    "the opacity sources include h@xmath3-h@xmath3/he collision induced absorption , and molecular absorption due to the seven species listed above . note these are the same opacities used for the lds data retrieval in @xcite .",
    "we compute the significance of the high - resolution models as explained in section  [ sec : hds_metric ] . to translate this information into an hds posterior we bin the parameter space by 0.4 in @xmath31(abundance ) .",
    "we then assume that in a posterior - sampling algorithm such as a mcmc , a model @xmath18-@xmath1 deviant from the best - fitting model would be extracted with a probability @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes a normal distribution .",
    "as an example , the best - fitting model has @xmath34 and a model 2-@xmath1 deviant @xmath35 .",
    "the occupancy of a bin in the parameter space is therefore given by the sum of all the probabilities of the models falling in that range .",
    "the corresponding histogram is also computed for the lds posterior . in this case",
    "the occupancy is given by the number of models falling in each bin as derived from the lds retrieval analysis . in order to compute the joint posterior ,",
    "we multiply the hds and lds posterior histograms , bin by bin .",
    "this is equivalent to multiplying the probabilities , which means we are treating lds and hds as two independent measurements of the same quantities .",
    "figure  [ fig : co - h2o - co2_posterior ] shows examples of the two - dimensional , lds ( left panels ) and lds+hds ( right panels ) posteriors , obtained with the above method .",
    "the 1- , 2- and 3-@xmath1 confidence intervals are obtained by normalizing the histogram by the total occupancy and cutting the cumulative density function at 61% , 13.5% , and 1.1% , respectively .",
    "since the hds posterior is not obtained by freely exploring the parameter space , but it has been conditioned by the lds analysis , our joint posterior is reliable only when the sampling is sufficiently dense to fill the whole 12-dimensional parameter space , i.e. , within the 3-@xmath1 confidence interval .",
    "this is why in figure  [ fig : co - h2o - co2_posterior ] we generically draw in light gray the region of the parameter space more than 3-@xmath1 deviant from our best estimate of the parameter , without assigning any further confidence interval . in section  [ sec : future ] we further discuss the limits of this approach .",
    "in figure  [ fig : abundances ] we plot the marginalized joint posterior distribution of the 7 species included in our models ( in black ) and we compare it to their equivalent distribution from the low - resolution data only ( in red ) . in all cases",
    "the probability density functions of the joint analysis are narrower , and significantly for h@xmath3o , co , and co@xmath3 .    the spectral signature of co is expected to be substantial for giant planets at temperatures greater than 1000  k , and the inclusion of hds data encompassing a major co band results in substantially better constraints on its abundance compared to lds data .",
    "while the abundance of h@xmath3o  ( @xmath31(vmr)@xmath36 ) is found to be consistent with the expectations for a solar - composition atmosphere at the temperature of hd  209458  b , we measure abundances of co and co@xmath3 ( @xmath31(vmr)@xmath37 $ ] , respectively ) deviant by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . co and co@xmath3 are both opacity sources in the spitzer 4.5  channel , and their individual abundances can not be easily disentangled .",
    "this is reflected by a broad lds posterior ( figure  [ fig : co - h2o - co2_posterior ] , left - top panel ) , which spans a large range of abundances for the two species .",
    "however , the inference from the 2.3-  crires spectra should be unambiguous , as the spectral signatures of co and co@xmath3 are disentangled at high spectral resolution . as shown by the top panels of figure  [ fig : co - h2o - co2_posterior ] ,",
    "models with relatively low abundance of co@xmath3 and high co abundance were tested , and found at least 3-@xmath1 deviant from the best - fitting model .",
    "we hence tend to exclude a bias from conditioning hds data with the lds posterior .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rel_abundances ] we show the posterior distribution obtained for the relative abundances of methane , water vapor , and carbon monoxide .",
    "the combination of hds and lds produces very tight constraints on the relative abundances . for co and h@xmath3o",
    "we measure @xmath40([co]/[h@xmath3o ] )  @xmath41 .",
    "relative abundances with methane , which is non - detected , are instead looser as expected , with @xmath31([co]/[ch@xmath4 ] )  @xmath43 and @xmath31([h@xmath3o]/[ch@xmath4 ] )  @xmath44 .",
    "assuming chemical equilibrium and a planet temperature of 1700  k , the relative abundances of h@xmath3o  and co alone indicate c / o  @xmath45 at 4.4@xmath1 ( dashed blue lines in figure  [ fig : rel_abundances ] ) .",
    "we also compute the c / o by dividing the number densities of c and o atoms derived from their volume mixing ratios .",
    "when the number density of carbon dioxide is included , we obtain a very tight estimate of c / o = @xmath2 . without co@xmath3 ,",
    "the constraint is still consistent but more uncertain ( c / o = @xmath46 ) .",
    "both values are consistent with the stellar c / o of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we estimate the planet metallicity by assuming h@xmath3/he = 0.193 and deriving the mole fractions of hydrogen and metals based on their stoichiometry .",
    "we measure a metallicity of @xmath31[(m / h)/(m / h)@xmath48 = @xmath49 ( or 0.1 - 3.7@xmath0 stellar , @xmath50 ) .",
    "we adopt a stellar metallicity of ( m / h)@xmath51 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass - metallicity ] shows that hd  209458  b  sits just below the mass - metallicity relation for solar - system planets and other exoplanets with available measurements .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , the c / o and metallicity measurements presented here only depend on the parametrization chosen for the modeling , as no further assumption about the underlying elemental abundance ratios is made .",
    "however , we do implicitly assume that all the molecular species not included in our modeling have negligible abundances and do not influence the calculations .",
    "the completeness and accuracy of molecular line list databases can influence the template - matching technique utilized for hds studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in this context",
    "we explore the effect of two different line lists for water vapor on the outcome of our joint retrieval .",
    "we compare the @xcite and the hitemp2010 @xcite databases . on small",
    "wavelength ranges ( 10 nm ) , the two line lists produce models only mildly correlated ( correlation of 0.35 - 0.4 ) .",
    "furthermore , their cross - correlation peaks a few km / s from zero lag , detectable at spectral resolutions above 2 - 3@xmath52 .",
    "it indicates a mismatch in both line position and line strength potentially affecting the measured planet radial velocity , line broadening , and significance of high - resolution models .",
    "this could bias measurements of mass and orbital inclination of non - transiting planets , planet rotation , and the current analysis .",
    "we therefore also cross - correlate the hds data with spectra produced with the hitemp2010 database .",
    "when h@xmath3o  is mixed with the other species and over the full wavelength coverage of the crires observations ( 2.27 - 2.35 ) the agreement between the two analyses is remarkable , and we recover the same best - fitting values for absolute and relative molecular abundances .",
    "we measure a marginally lower significance of spectra produced with hitemp2010 , possibly due to the use of air pressure broadening versus the more appropriate h@xmath3 broadening used for the freedman database . reconciling the disagreement observed on small wavelength ranges with the consistency of the full analysis presented here",
    "is not straightforward , and will be subject to future investigation .",
    "as the first attempt at combining lds and hds , this study necessarily simplifies some details of the analysis .",
    "firstly , the hds analysis is conditioned on the posterior of the lds analysis .",
    "although this choice is consistent with our intent of computing a joint posterior distribution , it prevents us from exploring regions of the parameter space strongly disfavored by low - resolution spectra that could potentially be a good match to high - resolution spectra .",
    "given the sample size of 5,000 points , we can reliably produce a joint posterior distribution for the 1- , 2- and 3-@xmath1 confidence intervals ( right panels of figure  [ fig : co - h2o - co2_posterior ] ) , with the least significant regions of the parameter space possibly affected by the sampling . in the future we will explore numerical algorithms capable of speeding up the comparison of model spectra to hds data , so that a full mcmc on the latter will become feasible . in this way we will compute the lds and hds posteriors independently , which will fully highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both datasets , and the power of combining them .",
    "another aspect that is worth mentioning is that in the current implementation we are equally weighting the hds and lds data .",
    "this is supported by the similar evidence for co+co@xmath3 ( 4.1@xmath1 ) and h@xmath3o  ( 6.2@xmath1 ) reported in @xcite and the detection of co at s / n=5.2 in crires data .",
    "future work will be devoted to further assessing the relative weight of each dataset .",
    "this will enhance our predictive capabilities for designing coordinated observations with ground - based facilities and the james webb space telescope .",
