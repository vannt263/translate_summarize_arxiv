    "inflation , first introduced by guth @xcite , was introduced in the standard cosmological model to solve the homogeneity , the isotropy and the horizon problem .",
    "the latter is well explained due to the fact that inflation is characterized by an exponential or power - law expansion of the universe and at the same time a quasi - constant behavior of the hubble horizon .",
    "on the other hand the homogeneity and the isotropy problem is in fact not well explained because from the start the homogeneous and isotropic friedman - lematre metric is used . to really solve the problem",
    "one should start with an arbitrary metric and show that inflation takes place and that the universe evolves towards a friedman - lematre metric .",
    "the problem of the onset of inflation was considered numerically for spherical inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite and a semi - numerical analysis was done for inhomogeneous , quasi - isotropic universes @xcite using the long wavelength iteration scheme @xcite .",
    "they showed that a large initial inhomogeneity supresses the inflation stage .",
    "because of the analytical difficulties of the task , one can as a first step , consider only a homogeneous but anisotropic metric and try to solve the isotropy problem .",
    "this task was first undertaken by collins and hawking @xcite who showed that , within the bianchi type universe filled by matter satisfying the dominant energy condition and positive pressure criterion , the isotropy problem can only be solved for the types i , v , vii@xmath3 and vii@xmath4 .",
    "they showed also that only a subclass of vanishing measure in the space of all homogeneous initial conditions can approach isotropy .    with the presence of an inflationary stage , when the dominant energy condition is violated ,",
    "there was hope to obtain a cosmic no - hair theorem .",
    "the study done by heusler @xcite showed there is no no - hair theorem for a real scalar field having a convex positive potential with a vanishing local minimum in a bianchi type universe .",
    "in fact isotropy can only be approached if the underlying lie group of the bianchi type metric is compatible with a friedman - lematre model .    beside the bianchi type metrics",
    "the kantowski - sachs model also describes a spatially homogeneous universe .",
    "this model with a perfect fluid description of matter and with or without a cosmological constant has been studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "they found an anisotropic asymptotical behavior of the model .",
    "burd and barrow @xcite analyzed this system with a real scalar field having an exponential potential as a source . among others they found an anisotropic asymptotical behavior or that inflation can occur depending on the value of the coupling constant entering in the definition of the potential .",
    "the exponential potential is motivated by the fact that it can be obtained , for example , by dimensional reduction of more fundamental theories @xcite or in conformal equivalent theories of gravity whose lagrangian is an arbitrary analytic function of the scalar curvature @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will consider a real scalar field with a convex positive potential , but not necessarily with a local minimum , in a bianchi i , a bianchi iii and a kantowski - sachs model .",
    "these three model are in fact very closely related since it will be shown in section [ secbas ] that the differential equations describing the evolution of the models are the same and that only the constraint equations differ . in section [ secinh ]",
    "we study the inherent properties of the differential equations and we recover in the case of a local minimum of the potential a result of heusler @xcite .",
    "we also show why the solution of the dynamical system must be studied for a potential having a vanishing potential at infinity .",
    "section [ secstu ] is devoted to the special case of an exponential potential .",
    "the result obtained will be compared with the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section [ secnum ] the numerical integration of the system",
    "is done and in section [ seccon ] the results will be summarized .",
    "we consider a scalar field with a convex positive potential @xmath5 in a homogeneous universe having the following metric @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "we have respectively a bianchi - i ( b - i ) , a bianchi - iii ( b - iii ) , and a kantowski - sachs ( ks ) metric .",
    "the action is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the determinant of the metric and @xmath13 is the dual basis of @xmath14 . by varying the action with respect to the metric we get the einstein equations @xmath15 with @xmath16 for the b - i , the b - iii and the ks cases , we get respectively @xmath17 .    the klein - gordon equation is obtained by varying the action with respect to the scalar field .",
    "we get @xmath18    in the following we will express every quantity in units of the planck mass @xmath19 . this can be achieved by setting @xmath20 in the einstein equations .",
    "the system is fully determined by the independent equations ( [ e0 ] ) , ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) . one can easily show that equation ( [ e2 ] ) follows from the others .",
    "this is a reflection of the bianchi identities .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations , these equations can be written as a set of four first order differential equations , which are @xmath21 independent , and a constraint ( eq.([e0 ] ) ) which is conserved in the evolution .",
    "this set of equations can also be written in function of the expansion rate @xmath22 and the shear tensor @xmath23 of the hypersurface of constant time @xmath24 .",
    "we get for the first order equations @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ ed3 ] ) . as for the constraint equation",
    ", it reads @xmath29 the solutions of eqs.([ed1])-([ed4 ] ) do not depend on the type of the homogeneous model considered . since eq.([constraint ] ) is conserved , we have to specify the homogeneous model only in the initial conditions .",
    "in the four dimensional space with coordinates @xmath30 the b - i solutions are on the `` lightcone '' , the b - iii ones are in it and the ks solutions remains outside the lightcone ( see fig .",
    "the advantage of taking these geometrical meaningful quantities is obvious : the shear tensor expresses the direction dependent deviation from the global expansion .",
    "hence , @xmath31 measures the anisotropy . as a criterium of isotropization",
    "we will not use the vanishing of @xmath31 ( as in @xcite ) , but a stronger condition @xcite which is @xmath32 in this paper , we want to analyze the evolution of an expanding universe .",
    "hence , we will restrict ourselves to positive values of @xmath22 .",
    "we want to know under which conditions the isotropization of this model is generic and when inflation occurs . in some cases",
    ", general properties of the solutions can be found by just analyzing the differential equations .",
    "this section generalizes , in some respect , a result obtained by m. heusler @xcite . in the b - i ( @xmath33 ) and the b - iii ( @xmath34 ) case",
    ", the asymptotic behavior of the solutions can be obtained directly by the study of eqs.([ed1])-([constraint ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in the evolution of an expanding universe , we suppose that @xmath22 is positive or equal to zero at some time @xmath35 . we also restrict ourselves to positive and convex function @xmath5 . from eq.([ed1 ] ) and eq.([constraint ] ) , we get the following inequality relation ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 using the last inequality relation and again eqs.([ed1],[constraint ] ) , it is easy to obtain @xmath38 setting @xmath39 which is positive , we can write @xmath40 by hypothesis , @xmath41 is positive at @xmath35 . substituting eq.([deft ] ) in eq.([in2 ] ) , we have that @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 can only increase with time and @xmath22 will remain positive after @xmath35 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath22 is a positive , monotonic decreasing function and thus , we must have @xmath43 this function converges towards the critical value @xmath44 .",
    "it is also easy to get @xmath45 since the l.h.s of the inequality is a sum of negative terms , we have that each of them must vanish as @xmath46 . using this fact in the constraint equation , we obtain @xmath47 eq.([ed4 ] ) describes a damped harmonic oscillator , so we know that the system must `` land '' at the minimum of the potential @xmath48 and thus @xmath49 for an exponential potential , the only minimum is at infinity and is value is zero .",
    "let us summarize the results by the following theorem    let be @xmath33 or @xmath50 ( bianchi - i and bianchi - iii case ) .",
    "if at a given time @xmath35 we have an expanding universe , that is @xmath51 , then    1 .",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 for all @xmath54 , 2 .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , for @xmath46 and 3 .",
    "@xmath58 , where @xmath48 is the minimum of the potential and in particular @xmath59 for an exponentially potential ( i.e. @xmath60 ) for @xmath46 .",
    "this theorem restates the proposition 1 in @xcite except than it can now also be applied for a convex potential @xmath5 having its minimum at infinity .",
    "if @xmath61 , we can use the known result that the b - i and the b - iii converge exponentially to the isotropic de - sitter universe @xcite . if @xmath62 at some finite value @xmath63 then we only have isotropization in the b - i case @xcite .",
    "the above theorem gives no answer on isotropization for an exponential potential in a b - i or a b - iii model .",
    "indeed , @xmath22 and @xmath31 vanish together . in this case , the asymptotic solutions of the dynamical system ( eqs([ed1])-([ed4 ] ) ) must be found to know under which conditions isotropy and/or inflation can occur .",
    "since the equations of the dynamical system do not depend on @xmath21 , the ks case will also be solved .",
    "this system has been actually studied in a paper of burd and barrow @xcite . however , their analysis on the system was not complete .",
    "their analysis covers a part of the phase space only .",
    "indeed , only two of the critical points were found and some conclusions turn out to be incorrect .    in the next section , the analysis of the exponential potential case will be done in detail and we will compare our results with ref . @xcite .",
    "for a qualitative discussion of the system of differential equations - we have to determine the asymptotic behavior near the critical points .",
    "the usual methods of treating the problem rapidly turn out to be inadequate for this case : the singular points are highly non - hyperbolic so that the linearization or even the transformation to a normal - form lead nowhere .",
    "usually , the constraint equation can be used as a ljapunov - function .",
    "but in this case , eq . has no isolated root and therefore is of no help .",
    "there is no other obvious candidates for a ljapunov - function .",
    "the problems originate from the fact that there are only quadratic terms on the right hand side of eqs.- .",
    "there is a standard procedure for such systems : one has to `` divide '' all variables but one by the remaining variable and rewrite the system in terms of these new variables .",
    "of course this transformation is only non - singular if the divisor does not vanish in the whole region of definition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the remaining variable was chosen to be @xmath64 , which does not vanish in finite regions of the phase space . here",
    ", we prefer to distinguish the variable @xmath22 since it will allow us to find additional critical points ( in finite regions of phase space ) .",
    "this transformation is well defined outside the origin .    defining the variables @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 by @xmath68 and the time @xmath69 by @xmath70 the differential equations - transform into @xmath71 the dynamical system defined by eqs.- , which are independent of @xmath22 , will be referenced from now on by the tag ( @xmath72 ) .    for the bianchi i case ( @xmath33 )",
    ", equation describes the surface of an ellipsoid , say @xmath73 , which separates the kantowski - sachs ( inside ) from the bianchi  iii ( outside ) solutions .",
    "the bianchi  i model ( @xmath33 ) has to be treated carefully because in this case the system can only evolve on a twodimensional submanifold @xmath74 in the space of the variables @xmath75 , defined by @xmath76 it may happen that @xmath74 coincides with the stable manifold of a critical point which is unstable with respect to the whole system ( @xmath72 ) . in this case the point is nevertheless stable for the bianchi  i metric .",
    "we will concentrate on determining the asymptotic behavior of this reduced system .",
    "@xmath22 is then given by a simple integration of .",
    "after a short calculation we find for the system ( @xmath72 ) three discrete critical points and a one - parameter family of critical points : @xmath77 $ } \\label{krits}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing these critical points with the results of burd and barrow @xcite one easily verifies that @xmath78 and @xmath79 correspond to their critical points @xmath80 and @xmath81 whereas @xmath82 and the points of @xmath24 have no counterpart in their paper .",
    "using the variables in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath82 and @xmath24 can be found as critical points lying at infinity in their phase space . to be sure that there are no additional critical points at infinity in our coordinate system either",
    ", we first introduce spherical coordinates @xmath83 and then map the points at infinity ( @xmath84 ) to the surface of a unit sphere by the transformations @xmath85 at infinity ( @xmath86 ) we thus find @xmath87 for a critical point at infinity , expressions  have to vanish simultaneously which is easily seen to be impossible .",
    "therefore the points @xmath82 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the points of @xmath24 are really the only critical points of the system ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the critical points correspond to exact solutions of our original system ( - ) . indeed ,",
    "if we consider the pull - back of a critical point ( @xmath88 ) of ( @xmath72 ) for a non - constant potential ( @xmath89 ) , the volume expansion @xmath22 is given by @xmath90 with @xmath91 , and as a function of the original time @xmath92 we obtain the following exact solutions @xmath93 the stability analysis of the critical points will give the stability of the above exact solutions .",
    "the linearization of ( @xmath72 ) around the critical point @xmath95 @xmath96 is diagonal and has eigenvalues @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "so @xmath82 is unstable both to the future and to the past .",
    "starting around @xmath82 , the critical point can never be reached by any solutions of the dynamical system .",
    ", the critical point @xmath82 will correspond to the unstable solution @xmath99      in @xmath78 the linearization of ( @xmath72 ) has the eigenvalues @xmath101 ( twice ) and @xmath102 , so the critical point is asymptotically stable ( with respect to all the system ( @xmath72 ) and for @xmath103 ) as long as @xmath104 and unstable for @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath78 lies on the ellipsoid which separates the ks from the biii domain , its neighborhood intersects all three types of universe .",
    "more precisely , starting from a point @xmath67 , near @xmath78 , defined by @xmath106 the constraints equation expanded to first order tells us to which universe @xmath67 belongs since we have @xmath107 depending from which point we start the integration , the solution can be in either type of universe .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the bianchi  i ( @xmath33 ) metric has to be considered very carefully because the system is constrained by to the two - dimensional submanifold @xmath74 .",
    "the tangential space to @xmath74 in the point @xmath78 is given by @xmath108 but @xmath109 is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue @xmath110 , and so @xmath111 coincides with the eigenspace to the eigenvalue @xmath112 .",
    "that is , @xmath74 is the stable submanifold through @xmath78 for @xmath113 and consequently @xmath78 is in all this range an asymptotically stable critical point for bianchi  i solutions , contrary to the bianchi  iii and kantowski - sachs solutions .",
    "this particular behavior for the bi case was overseen in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the special values @xmath114 and",
    "@xmath115 at least one eigenvalue vanishes and the linearization does not contain enough information to determine the stability of @xmath78 . by projecting the system ( @xmath72 ) on a center manifold through @xmath78",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath78 is unstable for @xmath114 .",
    "in the case @xmath115 the center manifold is two dimensional and therefore the stability analysis is much more difficult . we did not found the asymptotical properties of the solutions around this singular point for this value of @xmath116 .",
    "the critical point @xmath78 transforms back to the exact solution @xmath117 for @xmath118 this solution violates the dominant energy condition ( @xmath119 ) and thus inflation occurs .",
    "this can be directly seen since from the above equation we obtain @xmath120 for the asymptotically stable range ( @xmath104 for ks , biii and @xmath113 for bi ) of @xmath78 the solution is also asymptotically stable in the sense that solutions which start near it converge to it .",
    "the eigenvalues of the linearization of ( @xmath72 ) in @xmath79 are @xmath122 for @xmath104 , all eigenvalues are real , @xmath110 and @xmath123 have different signs , so @xmath79 is unstable . for @xmath114 , @xmath79 coincides with @xmath78 so we conclude as before that the critical point is unstable . in the range",
    "@xmath124 all eigenvalues are real and negative , while for @xmath125 @xmath110 and @xmath123 become complex with the same negative real part .",
    "so @xmath79 is asymptotically stable for @xmath126 .",
    "again we find the following exact solution after the pull - back of @xmath79 @xmath127 which is asymptotically stable for @xmath126 .",
    "since the critical points in @xmath24 are on the ellipsoid @xmath73 , we find as before ( section [ sssecp2 ] ) that there are points belonging to all three type of universe near @xmath24 .    for the linearization of ( @xmath72 ) around a point @xmath129 of @xmath24",
    "we find the eigenvalues @xmath130 if @xmath131 , @xmath110 and @xmath123 have different signs and the critical point is unstable both to the future and to the past .",
    "if @xmath132 , @xmath110 and @xmath123 are both positive , so @xmath133 is unstable to the future .",
    "the stability for @xmath134 is determined by the behavior of the system on a center manifold @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath24 itself is a center manifold and that the restriction of ( @xmath72 ) to @xmath24 is just the trivial system @xmath135 that means that for @xmath134 @xmath133 is an attractor .",
    "it his also easy to see that for @xmath136 @xmath24 as a whole is a past - attractor for ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath110 is then positive for all points @xmath133 .",
    "the pull - back of points out of @xmath24 gives an exact solution of the form @xmath137 with the condition @xmath138 .",
    "the cases with @xmath139 ( constant potential ) can be treated analogously . for the critical points @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "this has been done by burd and barrow @xcite while for @xmath82 and @xmath24 the results founded are still valid since the asymptotic behavior does not depend on @xmath116 .",
    "the results of this section are summarized in table 1 ( isolated critical points ) and table 2 ( family @xmath24 ) .",
    "they show for every critical point the type of the corresponding exact solution ( bi / iii : bianchi  i / iii or k - s : kantowski - sachs ) , its isotropization ( is ) and inflation ( in ) ( e : exponential inflation , p : power - law inflation or - : no inflation ) , and the stability ( st ) of the critical points ( @xmath140 : asymptotic future - stable , @xmath141 : asymptotic future - stable for bianchi  i solutions and unstable otherwise , @xmath142 : past - convergence to @xmath24 and - : unstable ) .    from table 1 , it follows that for @xmath143 the unique asymptotical stable solution is represented by the point @xmath78 .",
    "this solution describes an inflationary and isotropic universe .",
    "for @xmath105 , isotropy can be reached without inflation if we restrict ourselves to the bi universe .",
    "this fact is compatible with a collins and hawking result @xcite , which states that for ordinary matter , within the bi universe , isotropy can be reached without inflation .",
    "indeed , for @xmath105 the equation of state of the matter field corresponding to the @xmath78 solutions is given by @xmath144 with @xmath145 - 1/3,1[$ ] and contains the ordinary matter case ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "for @xmath147 , the unique asymptotical stable solution is represented by the point @xmath79 .",
    "this biii solution describes an anisotropic universe .",
    "there is also a unique attractor in the past : the @xmath24 manifold . as a consequence",
    ", we must start the numerical integration near @xmath24 for having all the history of the evolution of the model .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the numerical integration .",
    "in this section we will follow numerically the evolution of the system - .",
    "we have seen in section [ secstu ] that the points of the surface @xmath24 are the only past - attractor of the system , so it seems obvious to study the development of solutions starting near the corresponding exact solution @xmath148 with @xmath149 and with @xmath150 .",
    "since these exact solutions are in the bi universe , the numerical solutions starting near @xmath24 can be in any three type of universe ( e.g. bi , biii or ks ) .    to distinguish the different future - attractors it is convenient not to plot the variables @xmath22 and @xmath31 themselves ( they always vanish as @xmath151 ) but the quantities @xmath152 and @xmath153 which converge to constant values at the critical points .      for the initial asymptotic behavior @xmath154 we will have a kantowski - sachs solutions if the following inequality is satisfied @xmath155 fig .",

    "the corresponding phase portraits are given in fig .",
    "the development of a solution with @xmath126 is shown in fig  4 .",
    "the solution approaches again the ( now unstable ) attractor @xmath78 , is repelled and finally converges towards the exact solution corresponding to the attractor @xmath79 .      for a bianchi  iii solution of the form the integration constants have to satisfy the condition @xmath157 the solutions with @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "5 ) initially tend to the bianchi  iii solution corresponding to @xmath82 .",

    "the perturbations of the initial state have to satisfy the equation @xmath158    for bianchi  i solutions , the exact solution corresponding to @xmath78 is attractive not only for @xmath104 but for the whole range for which @xmath78 is defined , that is for @xmath113 ( fig .  9 , phase portraits : fig .  10 )",
    ". the numerical calculation confirms our analysis for @xmath105 : the solutions still isotropize but are no longer inflationary as one can see from fig .",
    "11 where we have plotted @xmath159 which violates the dominant energy condition when negative .    for @xmath147",
    "we have again the solution to @xmath79 as the only attractor .",

    "we have studied the einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) equations for a convex positive potential in a bianchi i , bianchi iii and a kantowsky - sachs universe .    after analyzing the inherent properties of the equations , it was shown in section [ secinh ] why a detailed analysis of the solutions of the ekg equations was needed for a vanishing potential at infinity . by taking an exponential potential ( @xmath160 ) it was shown for which values of @xmath116 inflation and/or isotropy where reached asymptotically .",
