    "[ sect : intro ] gadolinium foils are used extensively for in - beam measurements of hyperfine interactions and nuclear moments @xcite .",
    "magnetized gadolinium foils are used in preference to iron foils in many applications of the transient - field technique @xcite to measure nuclear @xmath1  factors because larger perturbations of the particle-@xmath2 correlations can be obtained under otherwise similar experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "one disadvantage of gadolinium hosts , however , is that the magnetization is not well controlled , being sensitive to the crystalline structure of the foil , and varying considerably with both the applied field and the temperature , even at temperatures well below the curie temperature of 293 k @xcite .    as cooling with liquid nitrogen ( 77  k )",
    "is convenient in accelerator laboratories , most in - beam measurements which employ gadolinium hosts have been performed at somewhat higher temperatures near 90  k because of thermal losses and the effects of beam heating on the target . in transient - field measurements",
    "an external magnetic field , with strength typically in the range from 0.05 to 0.1 t , is applied to polarize the gadolinium foil .",
    "higher fields are avoided to ensure that bending of the primary beam is negligible @xcite .",
    "the spacial profile of the polarizing field along the beam direction is designed to minimize beam bending effects rather than to produce a uniform field at the target location .",
    "depending upon the design of the pole pieces and the location of the target , the profile of the external field across the target may not be uniform . under these conditions the magnetization in the beam spot must be carefully related to the off - line magnetization measurements .    in this paper",
    "a method of determining the relative magnetization of gadolinium foils under in - beam conditions is described . the static hyperfine magnetic field , which acts on the nuclei of coulomb excited 2@xmath3 states in @xmath4gd , is used to probe the local magnetization at the beam spot under in - beam conditions .",
    "measurements similar to the present work were performed by skaali _",
    "@xcite , and kalish _ et al .",
    "additional complementary information was also obtained by husser _",
    "_ @xcite . in these previous works , however , the focus was on the precessions of the 4@xmath3 and 6@xmath3 states as probes of the strength of the transient hyperfine magnetic field . here",
    "the emphasis is on the 2@xmath3 states and the strength of the static hyperfine magnetic field .    while the interpretation of the hyperfine interactions in terms of the relative magnetization of different samples turns out to be rather straight - forward ,",
    "there are several additional phenomena associated with the hyperfine fields and the ion - implantation process that may have bearing on the interpretation of the data .",
    "the present work will therefore include discussions of :    1 .",
    "the presence of the electric - field gradient in the gadolinium matrix , which means that the hyperfine interaction can not universally be treated as a pure magnetic interaction 2 .",
    "the effects of those implanted nuclei which reside on damaged or other non - substitutional sites 3 .   the magnitude of the transient hyperfine magnetic field , which acts on the implanted ions as they slow within the host , and which for gd in gadolinium has the opposite sign to the static hyperfine field 4 .   a possible misalignment between the hyperfine magnetic field and the external polarizing field , which can affect the interpretation of the perturbed angular correlation when the host is not fully saturated    the paper is arranged as follows : the next section ( section  [ sect : fieldreview ] ) reviews previous work on the electric and magnetic hyperfine fields experienced by gd ions in gadolinium .",
    "section  [ sect : impac ] describes the in - beam measurements , presents examples of @xmath2-ray and particle spectra , and summarizes the excited - state lifetimes , @xmath1  factors and quadrupole moments adopted for the analysis .",
    "the off - line magnetization measurements are presented in section  [ sect : magmeas ] .",
    "section  [ sect : ac ] concerns the ` unperturbed ' angular correlations measured at room temperature .",
    "it includes a review of the formalism , along with the results and a discussion of the measurements , which indicate the direction of the electric - field gradient in the gadolinium foils .",
    "the perturbed angular correlation results are presented in section  [ sect : pac ] .",
    "the formalism and data analysis procedures are described , the effects of combined electric - quadrupole and magnetic - dipole interactions are evaluated , as are the effects of nuclei on damaged sites .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sect : disc ] .",
    "gadolinium has a hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) crystal structure .",
    "nuclei within the gadolinium matrix therefore experience a hyperfine electric - field gradient along with the magnetic dipole interaction . below the curie temperature of 293  k",
    ", gadolinium is a simple ferromagnet with a magnetic anisotropy that has a complex dependence on temperature .",
    "thus the easy direction of magnetization changes as a function of temperature , as does the magnetic hyperfine field .",
    "mssbauer studies @xcite reveal anisotropic magnetic hyperfine interactions in gadolinium crystals , with a field of @xmath5  t at 4.2  k oriented at 28@xmath6 to the @xmath7 axis ( unpolarized sample ) .",
    "the electric field gradient is apparently less sensitive to temperature @xcite .",
    "the measured splitting at 4.2  k for @xmath8gd , @xmath9  mhz , implies an electric field gradient of @xmath10  v/@xmath11 , assuming @xmath12  b. this electric field gradient is consistent with that found for high - spin isomers in @xmath13gd at temperatures near 400  k @xcite .",
    "the electric - quadrupole and magnetic - dipole hyperfine fields acting on gd isotopes in various gadolinium samples at different temperatures have been studied previously by many techniques ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the present work the mssbauer values at 4.2  k will be taken as the point of reference .",
    "the sign of the static magnetic field has been determined to be negative , for example from in - beam perturbed angular correlation measurements @xcite .    since the present work concerns in - beam implantation of gd into gadolinium",
    ", the transient hyperfine magnetic field also acts on the ions before they come to rest .",
    "thus the net perturbation of the nuclear spin distribution has contributions from both the transient and static hyperfine magnetic fields . for states of spin 4@xmath14 and higher in the ground - state band ,",
    "the electric quadrupole interaction can be ignored ( see below and @xcite ) and the perturbation of the angular correlation is manifested essentially as a rotation through the angle @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the precession angle due to the transient field and @xmath17 is that due to the static field .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the meanlife , @xmath1 the @xmath1  factor of the excited nuclear state , and @xmath21 is the time taken for the recoiling ions to stop in the ferromagnet ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the static- and transient - field strengths , respectively . since @xmath24 and @xmath23 have opposite signs for gd in gadolinium , the two contributions tend to cancel",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : dtheta ] ) is correct only for small precession angles because the static - field perturbation includes an attenuation as well as the rotation of the radiation pattern .",
    "furthermore , for the longer - lived 2@xmath3 states the quadrupole interaction can not safely be ignored .",
    "the formalism needed for a rigorous analysis of the data is presented in section  [ sect : pac ] along with a discussion of the combined effect of the electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interactions on the observed angular correlations .",
    "hyperfine fields acting on gd ions implanted into gadolinium were measured using the implantation perturbed angular correlation ( impac ) technique , following procedures similar to those in an earlier study of pt in gadolinium @xcite .",
    "the measurements were performed using 40  mev @xmath0o@xmath25 beams from the australian national university 14ud pelletron accelerator .",

    "requires that in run ii , 11.6@xmath59% of the implanted nuclei reside on field - free sites . in runs iii and iv ,",
    "the field - free fractions are 6.7@xmath60% and 6.1@xmath61% , respectively , giving an average of @xmath62% .",
    "thus the two - site analysis adopted @xmath63 for run iii and @xmath64 for runs iii and iv .",
    "the initial expectation would be that @xmath58 should be the same for all three runs .",
    "it is not clear why a higher percentage of ions apparently reside on damaged sites in run ii .",
    "since the hyperfine fields experienced by the implanted nuclei in run ii are very different from those in runs iii and iv , this difference might indicate that there is another effect associated with the perturbed angular correlations that has not been taken into account .",
    "the apparently different value of @xmath58 was retained for the two - site analysis of run ii , subject to the caveat that it might not represent the true field - free fraction .",
    "the primary motivation for the present measurements was to obtain an in - beam measure of the local magnetization of the gadolinium target foils , which can vary from foil to foil and for different beam - heating conditions .",
    "clearly , the effective hyperfine field strength varies with the magnetization .",
    "the following discussion explores the extent to which ratios of effective fields can be interpreted as ratios of the host magnetizations .    along with the presentation of the experimental data ,",
    "the previous sections have established that the gadolinium foils used in the present experiments are quasi single crystals in which the electric - field gradient is directed along the beam direction ( sections  [ sect : magmeas ] and [ sect : acresults ] ) .",
    "it has been noted that the effect of the electric - field gradient is negligible for 4@xmath3 states .",
    "it has also been shown that , for the analysis procedures adopted here , the effect of the electric - field gradient along the beam direction is essentially negligible for the longer - lived 2 @xmath3 states as well .",
    "it follows that the presence of the electric - field gradient does not impede the use of the effective static - field strength as a measure of the local magnetization .    before coming to a discussion of the results in terms of the local magnetization and beam heating effects ( section  [ sect : discd ] ) ,",
    "it is necessary first to discuss the effect of the hyperfine field being misaligned with respect to the external field due to domain misalignment below the saturation magnetization ( section  [ sect : discb ] ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated for several impurities implanted into iron that internal hyperfine magnetic fields may be misaligned with respect to the direction of the external polarizing field , and that this effect is associated with domain rotation in an incompletely saturated sample @xcite . at some level",
    "the effect is expected for all impurity - host combinations .",
    "figure [ fig : misaligned ] shows the effect of misaligned hyperfine fields on the analysis of the perturbed angular correlations .",
    "two limiting cases of misaligned fields are assumed . in the first case",
    "the internal fields are assumed to lie on a cone of half angle @xmath65 , whose axis is the external field direction . in the second case the internal field",
    "is assumed to lie in the plane defined by the beam axis and the external field direction , i.e. at angles @xmath65 , @xmath66 in terms of the co - ordinate frame in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] . given that the gadolinium target has a texture such that it resembles a quasi single crystal with the @xmath7  axis along the beam , the latter case is likely to be more realistic in the present work .",
    "the formulae for evaluating these perturbed angular correlations are given in the appendix .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : misaligned ] that if the internal field is misaligned with respect to the external field , then the true precession angle around the internal - field direction is always larger than that derived when no misalignment is assumed .",
    "at least part of the difference between the effective static fields observed here and the mssbauer result at 4 k ( @xmath67 t @xcite ) is likely to be associated with misalignment between the internal and external fields .",
    "indeed the subtle overall tendency for the effective static fields in table  [ tab:2+fields ] to increase slightly from @xmath29gd to @xmath68gd , as the 2@xmath3 state lifetimes and hence the @xmath69 values increase , might be associated with misalignment between the internal and external fields , which has not been included in the analysis .",
    "( note that the difference between the different curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : misaligned ] decreases as @xmath30 increases . )",
    "however the trend is below the statistical precision of the data .",
    "it can be concluded that although the perturbed angular correlations may show some sensitivity to the direction of the internal field , the ratios of @xmath30 values derived assuming that the internal and external fields are parallel can still be interpreted as magnetization ratios , to a very good approximation .",
    "there is no significant difference between the _ ratios _ of effective fields determined from the one - site or two - site analysis of the data .",
    "the following discussion will therefore use the ratios of the observed precession angles in the simpler single - site analysis as the measure of the relative magnetizations .",

    "[ fig : magplot ] ) .",
    "thermal conductivity calculations were performed with the quickfield package @xcite to investigate the effects of beam heating on gadolinium target foils , with and without copper backing layers .",

    "again , these schematic calculations reproduce the experimental difference between runs ii and iii .    there remains a difference , of the order of 10% , between the magnetizations of target a and target b under conditions where the beam heating is essentially negligible ( runs iii and iv ) .",
    "this difference must be attributed to differences in the crystalline texture of the foils .",
