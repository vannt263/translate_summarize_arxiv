    "light - by - light scattering is a purely quantum process , hence , in the standard model , only possible in the context of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",

    "the scattering amplitude in the lowest order is described by the box diagram where a virtual @xmath0 pair loops between four external photons . so far",
    "the diagram is indirectly confirmed with off - shell external photons via @xmath2  @xcite known as delbrck scattering  @xcite and also proposed to be further tested via @xmath3 in the higher energy domain at the large hadron collider  @xcite . in these scatterings , however , photons are emitted from nuclei @xmath4 and have finite off - shell masses . with the exact on - shell condition , namely , real - photon - real - photon scattering has not been demonstrated hitherto despite of its explicit predictions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , its dependence on the photon polarization states has not been tested at all . by means of off - shell incident photons from nuclei ,",
    "it is difficult to test the polarization property .",
    "photon - photon interactions also contain rich information on the two - photon coupling to standard model / non - standard model resonance states depending on the center of mass energy . in the mev range ,",
    "no direct search for resonance states coupling to two photons has been performed .",
    "therefore , it is indispensable to first verify the purely qed - based scattering amplitude with specified polarization states in a pristine experimental condition , because a significant deviation from the prediction indicates the existence of physics beyond the standard model .     scattering via inverse compton scatterings between cicularly polarized laser pulses and unpolarized electrons .",
    "r and l denote right- and left - handed helicity states of photons , respectively . ]    in lower energies , searches for photon - photon interactions have been performed at kev  @xcite , ev  @xcite and sub - ev energy scales attempting to search for dark matter  @xcite and also to put the upper limit on the qed photon - photon interaction  @xcite .",
    "there are several proposals  @xcite to probe photon - photon interactions in the context of the low energy limit of the qed interactions  @xcite based on only optical photons .",
    "these proposals commonly suffer from its extremely weak interaction .",
    "therefore , currently state - of - the - art high - power lasers are supposed to be indispensable .",
    "however , if such lasers are available , we may also use them to generate @xmath1-rays .",
    "this idea leads us to try to consider the direct measurement of the scattering with the maximized cross - section at the center - of - mass system energy of 1 - 2 mev rather than based on 1 ev photons .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the feasibility to measure the helicity dependent @xmath5-scattering based on the helicity configuration as illustrated in fig.[fig0 ] where circularly polarized laser pulses are reflected upon unpolarized electron bunches and @xmath1-rays in the same helicity state collide head - on .",
    "we then consider to measure the elastic scattering without specifying the helicity states of the final state @xmath1-rays .",
    "in contrast to the helicity dependence emphasizing on the forward scattering amplitude  @xcite , we rather aim at larger angle scattering events in order to verify the purely perturbative prediction . in the following paragraphs",

    "the elastic scattering of photons by photons has been thoroughly evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section per solid angle for the unpolarized photon - photon scattering in the lower energy limit is approximated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is electron mass in units of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the incident photon energy in the center - of - mass system , @xmath14 is the dimensionless fine structure constant , @xmath15  cm is the classical electron radius , and @xmath9 is the polar angle of scattered photons with respect to the colliding axis between two incident photons in the center - of - mass system on the reaction plane . for laser photons of @xmath16  ev , the total cross section is @xmath17  b. this is extremely small due to the steep @xmath18 dependence .",
    "this situation is shown in fig.[fig1 ] where the differential cross section of the unpolarized photon - photon elastic scattering , @xmath19 at @xmath6 , is plotted as a function of the center - of - mass system energy of photon - photon collisions , @xmath8 .",
    "the cross section curve is obtained from the numerical calculation applying formulae in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath20  mev is realized , the total cross section is maximized up to @xmath21  @xmath7b .",
    "therefore , in order to detect the perturbative qed cross section , it is reasonable to perform the scattering experiment tuned at that energy range . in the region",
    "@xmath22  mev , we see a flat - top character .",
    "this allows relatively large fluctuations on @xmath8 , which is preferable for the photon - photon collider exploiting @xmath1-rays via laser compton scattering off electrons from lpa having a percent - level energy spread .",
    "figure [ fig1b ] shows the helicity dependent qed - based differential cross section @xmath23 compared to the unpolarized cross section where the symbols @xmath24 indicate the same and opposite helicity states between incident two @xmath1-rays going to all the possible helicity states .",

    "an electron beam with 210 mev and 1.6 nc are produced from a two - stage laser wakefield accelerator  @xcite comprising a 5-mm long gas cell filled with the mixed gas ( e.g. , 94 % helium and 6 % nitrogen ) for the injector stage and a variable - length gas cell filled with pure helium for the accelerator stage . designing parameters of the laser wakefield accelerator",
    "can be carried out by relying on the scaling law of nonlinear plasma wakefields in the bubble regime  @xcite .",
    "provided that a laser pulse with 41 tw peak power and 85 fs duration is focused on 12 @xmath7 m spot radius on the entrance of the injector cell operated at plasma density of @xmath30 @xmath31 , strong nonlinear wakefields can be generated so that a 1.6 nc electron bunch could be trapped due to ionization - induced injection  @xcite and accelerated up to 40 mev , followed by boosting its energy up to 210 mev at the length of 2.6 cm in the accelerator cell operated at plasma density of @xmath32 @xmath31 . the relative energy spread and the normalized emittance of resultant output beams",
    "are estimated to be 4 % in r.m.s . and",
    "0.15 mm mrad , respectively .",
    "the electron bunch is then focused via a set of permanent - magnet - based quadrupoles ( pmqs )  @xcite consisting of three elements -275 t / m , 770 t / m and -650 t / m with the common inner radius 3.0 mm and outer radius 12.0 mm , respectively , over 71.2 cm as shown in fig.[fig3 ] which displays variations of the horizontal and vertical beam envelopes simulated by trace3d  @xcite for the given incident parameters of the lpa configuration above .",
    "based on these counter - propagating electron beams , we evaluate the number of incident @xmath1-rays produced by the inverse nonlinear compton process between a circularly polarized laser pulse and an unpolarized electron bunch produced by lpa . it is worth noting that once we fix the focusing geometry , we can not increase the effective number of @xmath1-rays as much as we like even if we could increase the laser pulse energy .",
    "this is because of the nonlinear nature of compton scattering represented by the parameter @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the four - vector potential of the laser pulse  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 parameter increases the effective electron mass @xmath36 in the laser field .",
    "hence , the scattered photon energy in the single photon absorption case is effectively lowered and the photon yield in the compton edge energy also diminishes . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger number of laser photons increases the luminosity factor in the compton scattering .",
    "therefore , there is an optimal @xmath35 value so that the scattered photon energy is kept within 0.5 - 1.0 mev range with the maximized @xmath1-ray yield .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    ", we plot this situation in three different @xmath35 cases : solid ( @xmath37 ) , dashed ( @xmath38 ) and dash - dotted ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] a ) shows the differential cross sections @xmath40 in units of @xmath41 as a function of photon scattering angle measured from the incident direction of the electron beam , where the abscissa is displayed in units of @xmath42 with the lorentz factor defined by the effective electron mass in the laser field .",

    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 cases are plotted with thicker and thiner lines , respectively .",
    "the cross sections are numerically calculated based on the expressions available in ref .  @xcite . in any @xmath35 cases , in order to enhance the purity of the @xmath44 case , we must consider @xmath1-rays produced only in @xmath46 as the effective number of @xmath1-rays useful for the test of helicity specified @xmath5-scatterings .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] b ) shows @xmath8 distributions by taking all possible energy combinations between two incident @xmath1-rays from the compton scattering points with the cross section weights in the @xmath44 case within @xmath46 in fig.[fig4 ] a ) , where the area of the distributions indicate squares of the numbers of generated @xmath1-rays , @xmath47 , corresponding to the numerators in the luminosity factor for the @xmath5-collider as we discuss below .",
    "the head - on luminosity factor for @xmath5-scattering is defined as @xmath48 where we assume @xmath5-collisions take place along the electron beam axis within the effective @xmath1-beam radius at ip , @xmath49 . because the distance between the two cp points , @xmath28 , should be kept as small as possible to increase @xmath47 , @xmath49 effectively coincides with the beam waist of the compton seed laser , @xmath50 , if the electron beam radius is much smaller than @xmath50 . on the other hand , in order to enrich the @xmath51 case in the qed - based @xmath5-scattering , the requirement to enhance the @xmath44 case by limiting the effective scattering angle @xmath46 demands the relation @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that we can control the purity of the initial circular polarization states by adjusting @xmath28 in experiments .",

    "we summarize optimal parameters for an all - optical photon - photon collider in the case of @xmath54 in table 1 .",
    "for instance , if we apply this detection system to two synchronized lasers operated at @xmath55 hz , a data taking period over several months will be sufficient to claim the statistical significance of the qed - based elastic scattering events for the @xmath51 case .    .",
    "parameters for the all - optical photon - photon collider lpa drive laser [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    due to the short @xmath28 , we simultaneously have to consider electron - electron scattering after the inverse compton scattering occurs , because this mller s scattering can produce dominant background events against the elastic @xmath5-scattering as shown in fig.[fig7 ] a ) and b )",
    ". however , as far as only large angle scattering events in the range of @xmath56 degree are measured , the partially integrated cross section of mller s scattering over that solid angle is suppressed to 17.7 @xmath7b for the electron energy of 210 mev , which is evaluated by the following differential cross section with respect to solid angle @xmath57 $ ] where @xmath58 is the incident electron energy in the center - of - mass system . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section of qed @xmath5-scattering is relatively enhanced over the background events in the same @xmath9 range . taking the higher luminosity factor for the electron - electron scattering than that of @xmath5-scattering into account , the event rate for mller s scattering reaches 0.36 hz for @xmath59 hz and the accidental rate for two types of scattering events to occur within the same shot can be evaluated as @xmath60 hz .",
    "this contaminated event rate corresponds to 36 % of that of the qed @xmath5-scattering .",
    "therefore , even if one throws such contaminated events away without the detailed event - by - event offline analysis , the statistical loss of the qed events is still acceptable . in reality , the energy deposits on the detector as well as the event topologies , whether electromagnetic showers exist or not , are very different between qed @xmath5-scattering and mller s scattering as displayed in fig.[fig7 ] a ) and b ) .",
    "therefore , one can readily distinguish two types of scattering events at the offline analysis and possibly distinguish them even within the same shot , if the two @xmath1-clusters are sufficiently isolated from the background electromagnetic showers .",
    "moreover , counting the number of mller s scattering events is indispensable to directly measure the electron - electron luminosity in the actual experimental condition .",
    "this information is essentially important to deduce the @xmath5 luminosity in addition to the direct measurement of the @xmath1-ray flux .",

    "the detector system covers the polar angle @xmath62 degree and the azimuthal angle @xmath63 degree around the beam axis consisting of 90 scintillator crystals ( 18 crystals in @xmath64 layers in @xmath9 ) made of ce doped gd@xmath65so@xmath66 ( gso : ce ) .",
    "gso : ce is a well - balanced scintillator from the point of view on the scintillation - photon yield for a sub - mev @xmath1-ray , the time resolution and the radiation length @xmath67 .",
    "the radiation length @xmath68 cm is reasonably small to suppress the lateral spreads of the electromagnetic showers produced by 210 mev electrons .",
    "the individual crystal has the depth of @xmath69 . ]",
    "verification of the qed - based helicity dependent light - by - light scattering with the all - optical photon - photon collider is realizable in the table - top scale .",
    "provided pw - class lasers such as extreme light infrastructure ( eli )  @xcite we may be able to test the qed - based light - by - light scattering especially in the same circular polarization case of incident @xmath1-rays with an experimentally feasible rate .",
    "furthermore , the rapid development of fiber - based high - power and high - repetition rate lasers at 10  khz  @xcite would allow us to test the opposite circular polarization case and enable the comparison between the two helicity configurations quantitatively .",
    "the larger statistics also opens up opportunities to perform general resonance searches around the mev energy scale based on the landmark of quantitative verification of the qed - based perturbative photon - photon scattering .",
    "finally we emphasize that our proposal corresponds to the first case of lpa - based electron - electron and @xmath5-colliders applied to fundamental particle physics .",
    "if succeeded , it would be a ground - breaking advancement in experimental particle physics even if the center of mass energy is still in the mev range .",
