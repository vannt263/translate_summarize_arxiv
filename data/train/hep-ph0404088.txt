    "since 40 years large experimental efforts have gone into the investigation of nuclear double beta decay which probably is the most sensitive way to look for ( total ) lepton number violation and probably the only way to decide the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "it has further perspectives to probe also other types of beyond standard model physics .",
    "this thorny way has been documented recently in some detail @xcite .",
    "the half - lives to explore lying , with the order of 10@xmath3years , in a range on half way to that of proton decay , the two main experimental problems were to achieve a sufficient amount of double beta emitter material ( source strength ) and to reduce the background in such experiment to an extremely low level .",
    "the final dream behind all these efforts was less to see a standard - model allowed second - order effect of the weak interaction in the nucleus - the two - neutrino - accompanied decay mode - which has been observed meanwhile for about ten nuclei - but to see neutrinoless double beta decay , and with this a first hint of beyond standard model physics , yielding at the same time a solution of the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we describe the experiment , which was proposed in 1987 @xcite , and which started operation in the gran sasso underground laboratory with the first detector in 1990 .",
    "we report the result of the measurements over the full period august 1990 until may 2003 ( the experiment is still running , at the time of submission of this paper ) .",
    "the quality of the new data and of the present analysis , which has been improved in various respects , allowed us to significantly improve the investigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay process , and to deduce more stringent values on its parameters .",
    "we are giving in a detailed paper @xcite ( for earlier papers see @xcite ) a full description of the experimental procedure , the specific features and challenges of the data acquisition and background reduction .",
    "in this letter we mainly present the data , taken with a total statistics of 71.7kgy for the period august 2 , 1990 - may 20 , 2003 , and we present their analysis .",
    "the experiment is , with five enriched ( to ( 86% @xmath4 88% ) ) high - purity p - type germanium detectors , of in total 10.96 kg of active volume , using the largest source strength of all double beta experiments at present , and has reached a record low level of background .",
    "it is since ten years now the most sensitive double beta decay experiment worldwide .",
    "the detectors were the first _ high - purity _ ge detectors ever produced .",
    "the degree of enrichment has been checked by investigation of tiny pieces of ge _",
    "after _ crystal production using the heidelberg mp - tandem accelerator as a mass spectrometer . since 2001",
    "the experiment has been operated only by the heidelberg group , which also performed the analysis of the experiment from its very beginning .",
    "we start by listing up some of the most essential features of the experiment .    1 .   since the sensitivity for the half - life is @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 ) , with @xmath7 denoting the degree of enrichment , @xmath8 the efficiency of the detector for detection of a double beta event , @xmath9 the detector ( source ) mass , @xmath10 the energy resolution , @xmath11 the background and @xmath12 the measuring time , the sensitivity of our 11 kg _ of enriched _",
    "@xmath0 experiment corresponds to that of an at least 1.2ton _ natural _ ge experiment .",
    "after enrichment - the other most important parameters of a @xmath13 experiment are : energy resolution , background and source strength .",
    "the high energy resolution of the ge detectors of 0.2@xmath14 or better , assures that there is no background for a line from the two - neutrino double beta decay in this experiment ( 5.5 @xmath15 10@xmath16events expected in the energy range 2035@xmath42039.1kev ) , in contrast to most other present experimental approaches , where limited energy resolution is a severe drawback . 3 .   the efficiency of ge detectors for detection of decay events is close to 100@xmath14 ( 95% , see @xcite(a ) ) .",
    "4 .   the source strength in this experiment of 11",
    "kg is the largest source strength ever operated in a double beta decay experiment .",
    "the background reached in this experiment , is 0.113@xmath170.007events / kgykev ( in the period 1995 - 2003 ) in the decay region ( around q@xmath18 ) .",
    "this is the lowest limit ever obtained in such type of experiment .",
    "the statistics collected in this experiment during 13 years of stable running is the largest ever collected in a double beta decay experiment .",
    "the experiment took data during @xmath1 80% of its installation time .",
    "7 .   the q value for neutrinoless double beta decay has been determined recently with high precision @xcite .",
    "the background of the experiment consists of    1 .",
    "primordial activities of the natural decay chains from @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ; 2 .",
    "anthropogenic radio nuclides , like @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ; 3 .",
    "cosmogenic isotopes , produced by activation due to cosmic rays during production and transport .",
    "4 .   the bremsstrahlungs spectrum of @xmath26 ( daughter of @xmath27 ) ; 5 .   elastic and inelastic neutron scattering , and 6 .   direct muon - induced events .",
    "the detectors , except detector no . 4 , are operated in a common pb shielding of 30 cm , which consists of an inner shielding of 10 cm radiopure lc2-grade pb followed by 20 cm of boliden pb .",
    "the whole setup is placed in an air - tight steel box and flushed with radiopure nitrogen in order to suppress the @xmath28 contamination of the air .",
    "the shielding has been improved in the course of the measurement .",
    "the steel box is since 1994 centered inside a 10-cm boron - loaded polyethylene shielding to decrease the neutron flux from outside .",
    "an active anticoincidence shielding is placed on the top of the setup since 1995 to reduce the effect of muons .",
    "detector no .",
    "4 is installed in a separate setup , which has an inner shielding of 27.5 cm electrolytical cu , 20 cm lead , and boron - loaded polyethylene shielding below the steel box , but no muon shielding .",
    "the setup has been kept hermetically closed since installation of detector 5 in february 1995 . since then",
    "no radioactive contaminations of the inner of the experimental setup by air and dust from the tunnel could occur .",
    "a detailed description of the remaining background , and corresponding monte carlo simulations with geant4 are given in @xcite .",
    "important result is , that there are no background @xmath29-lines to be expected at the position of an expected line , according to this monte carlo analysis of radioactive impurities in the experimental setup @xcite and according to the compilations in @xcite .",
    "some @xmath29peaks in the simulated spectrum near q@xmath18 are emitted from the isotope @xmath30bi .",
    "so from @xmath31 ( @xmath32-decay chain ) in the vicinity of the q - value of the double beta decay of q@xmath18  =  2039kev , according to the table of isotopes @xcite , weak lines should be expected at 2010.7 , 2016.7 , 2021.8 and 2052.9kev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be especially noted , that also neutron capture reactions @xmath33 and @xmath34 and subsequent radioactive decay have been simulated by geant4 in @xcite .",
    "the simulation yields , in the range of the spectrum 1990 - 2110kev , for the total contribution from decay of @xmath35 0.15counts .",
    "so in particular , the 2037.8kev transition in the @xmath29-decay following @xmath36 decay of @xmath35 @xcite is not expected to be seen in the measured spectra .",
    "it would always be accompanied by a 10times stronger line at 2000.2kev @xcite , which is not seen in the spectrum ( figs .",
    "[ fig : low - hightall90 - 03],[fig : sum90 - 95 - 03-scan ] ) .",
    "to control the stability of the experiment , a calibration with a @xmath37 and a @xmath38+@xmath37 source , has been done weekly .",
    "high voltage of the detectors , temperature in the detector cave and the computer room , the nitrogen flow flushing the detector boxes to remove radon , the muon anticoincidence signal , leakage current of the detectors , overall and individual trigger rates are monitored daily .",
    "the energy spectrum is taken in parallel in 8192 channels in the range from threshold up to about 3 mev , and in a spectrum up to about 8 mev .",
    "data taking since november 1995 is done by a camac system , and cetia processor in event by event mode . to read out the used 250mhz flash adcs of type analog devices 9038 je ( in dl515 modules ) , which allow digital measurement of pulse shapes for the four largest detectors ( for later off - line analysis ) , a data acquisition system on vme basis has been developed @xcite(c ) .",
    "the resolution of the fadc s is 8bit , and thus not sufficient for a measurement of energies .",
    "the energy signals for high and low - energy spectra are recorded with 13bit adc s developed at mpi heidelberg .",
    "the acquisition system used _ until _ 1995 ( vax / vms ) did not allow to measure the pulse shapes of all detectors because of the too low data transfer rates .",
    "for the period 1990 - 1995 we prepared the final sum spectrum taken with the former electronics shortly after this measuring period , setting the proper conditions for data acceptance @xcite(a , b , c ) .",
    "since 1995 , in total we have taken with the since then new electronics , 2142 runs ( 10 513 data sets for the five detectors ) ( _ without _ calibration measurements ) , the average length of which was about one day . from these raw data runs and data sets only those are considered for further analysis which fulfill the following conditions :    1 .",

    "only pulses with ratios of the energy determined in the spectroscopy branch , and the area under the pulse detected in the _ timing _ branch ( eoi values @xcite ) , within a @xmath173@xmath2 range around the mean value for each detector are accepted ; 5 .",
    "we ignore for each detector the first 200days of operation , corresponding to about three half - lifes of @xmath40  ( @xmath41=77.27days ) , to allow for decay of short - lived radioactive impurities ; 6 .",

    "on the basis of the findings presented above we translate the observed number of events into the half - life for neutrinoless double beta decay . in table [ results ] we give the half - lives deduced from the full data sets taken in 1995 - 2003 and in 1990 - 2003kev and of some partial data sets , including also the values deduced from the single site spectrum . in the latter case we do conservatively not apply , a calibration factor . also given are the effective neutrino masses .",
    "the result obtained is consistent with the results we reported in @xcite , and also with the limits given earlier in @xcite .",

    "consequence of the above result is , that lepton number is not conserved .",
    "further the neutrino is a majorana particle see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "both of these conclusions are _ independent of any _ discussion of nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the matrix element enters when we derive a _ value _ for the effective neutrino mass - making the _ most natural assumption _ that the decay amplitude is dominated by exchange of a massive majorana neutrino .",
    "the half - life for the neutrinoless decay mode is under this assumption given by @xcite @xmath74^{-1}= c_{mm }   \\frac{\\langle m \\rangle^2}{m_{e}^2 } + c_{\\eta\\eta } \\langle \\eta \\rangle^2 + c_{\\lambda\\lambda }   \\langle \\lambda \\rangle^2 + c_{m\\eta } \\langle \\eta \\rangle \\frac{\\langle m \\rangle}{m_e }   + c_{m\\lambda } \\langle \\lambda \\rangle \\frac{\\langle m_{\\nu } \\rangle}{m_e}+c_{\\eta\\lambda } \\langle \\eta \\rangle \\langle \\lambda \\rangle,$ ] @xmath75 , where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) are the contributions to the effective mass @xmath78 from individual mass eigenstates , with @xmath79 denoting relative majorana phases connected with cp violation , and @xmath80 denote nuclear matrix elements squared .",
    "ignoring contributions from right - handed weak currents on the right - hand side of the above equation , only the first term remains .",
    "using the nuclear matrix element from @xcite , we conclude from the measured half - life given in table 2 the effective mass @xmath51 to be @xmath51 = ( 0.2 @xmath4 0.6)ev ( 99.73@xmath14 c.l . ) . the matrix element given by @xcite was the _ prediction closest to _ the _ later _ measured decay half - life of @xmath81y @xcite .",
    "it underestimates the 2@xmath82 matrix elements by 32% and thus these calculations will also underestimate ( to a smaller extent ) the matrix element for decay , and consequently correspondingly overestimate the ( effective ) neutrino mass . allowing conservatively for an uncertainty of the nuclear matrix element of @xmath17 50@xmath14 , the range for the effective mass may widen to @xmath51 = ( 0.1 - 0.9)ev ( 99.73% c.l . ) .    with the value deduced for the effective neutrino mass",
    ", the heidelberg - moscow experiment excludes several of the neutrino mass scenarios allowed from present neutrino oscillation experiments ( see fig . 1 , in @xcite ) - allowing only for degenerate mass scenarios @xcite .",
    "assuming other mechanisms to dominate the   decay amplitude , which have been studied extensively in recent years , the result allows to set stringent limits on parameters of susy models , leptoquarks , compositeness , masses of heavy neutrinos , of the right - handed w boson , and possible violation of lorentz invariance and equivalence principle in the neutrino sector . for a discussion and for references",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "concluding , evidence for a signal at q@xmath18 on a confidence level of 4.2@xmath2 has been observed confirming our earlier claim . on the basis of our pulse shape analysis",
    "this can be interpreted as evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay of @xmath0 , and thus for _ total _ lepton number nonconservation , and for a non - vanishing majorana neutrino mass .",
    "recent information from many _ independent _",
    "sides seems to condense now to a nonvanishing neutrino mass of the order of the value found by the experiment .",
    "this is the case for the results from cmb , lss , neutrino oscillations , particle theory and cosmology ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) . to mention a few examples : neutrino oscillations require in the case of degenerate neutrinos common mass eigenvalues of m @xmath83 0.04ev .",
    "an analysis of cmb , large scale structure and x - ray from clusters of galaxies yields a preferred value for @xmath84 of 0.6ev @xcite .",
    "wmap yields @xmath84 @xmath85 1.0ev @xcite , sdss yields @xmath84 @xmath85 1.7ev @xcite .",
    "theoretical papers require degenerate neutrinos with m @xmath83 0.1 and 0.2ev @xcite , and the recent alternative cosmological concordance model requires relic neutrinos with mass of order of ev @xcite .",
    "the z - burst scenario for ultra - high energy cosmic rays requires @xmath86@xmath1 0.4ev @xcite , and also non - standard model ( g-2 ) has been connected with degenerate neutrino masses @xmath830.2ev @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed that the majorana nature of the neutrino may tell us that spacetime does realize a construct that is central to construction of supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "looking into the future , there is some hope from the numbers given in table 2 , that the future tritium experiment katrin @xcite may see a positive signal , if tritium decay can solve this problem at all ( see @xcite )",
    ".    from future double beta projects to improve the present accuracy of the effective neutrino mass one has to require that they should be able to differentiate between a @xmath87 and a @xmath29 signal , or that the tracks of the emitted electrons should be measured . at the same time , as is visible from the present information , the energy resolution should be _ at least _ in the order of that of ge semiconductor detectors . if one wants to get _ independent additional _",
    "insight into the neutrinoless double beta decay process , one would probably wish to see the effect in _ another _ isotope , which would then simultaneously give additional information also on the nuclear matrix elements . in view of the above remarks , future efforts to obtain _ deeper _ information on the process of neutrinoless double beta decay ,",
    "would require _ a new experimental approach , different from all , what is at present persued_.",
    "the authors would like to thank all colleagues , who have contributed to the experiment over the last 15years .",
