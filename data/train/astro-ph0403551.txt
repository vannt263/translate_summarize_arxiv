    "scattering and absorption by interstellar dust depresses the observed flux of galaxy disks at optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "while the magnitude of the effect has been disputed , there is no doubt that the effect is strongly dependent on the inclination of a disk to the line of sight .",
    "a number of techniques have been used in observationally deriving extinction laws ( see for example the volume edited by davies and burstein 1995 , the review by calzetti 2001 and masters , giovanelli & haynes 2003 for details ) . goad and roberts ( 1981 ) first discussed a kinematical technique which we briefly describe as follows .",
    "let @xmath7 be the rotational velocity of an axially symmetric disk at the distance @xmath8 from its center and @xmath9 be a set of cartesian coordinates in the plane of the disk .",
    "if the disk is thin and its symmetry axis is inclined by an angle @xmath10 to the line of sight , the observed component of velocity which intercepts the disk at @xmath9 is v_= v(r ) x i + v_nc , where @xmath11 accounts for non  circular motions and the @xmath12 axis is oriented along the disk s apparent major axis .",
    "the observed rotation curve , as derived for example from a long  slit  spectrum positioned along the major axis , will depart from the prescription given by eqn . 1 as due to seeing , instrumental resolution , averaging across the slit width , the finite thickness of the disk and extinction occurring within the disk itself .",
    "as a realistically thick disk approaches the edge  on perspective , lines  of  sight along the major axis sample regions of increasingly broad range in @xmath13 , yielding a velocity distribution with a peak velocity contributed by parcels of gas asymmetrically distributed with respect to @xmath14 : if extinction is important , only foreground parts of the disk contribute to the emission and the factor @xmath15 depresses the velocity distribution observed at @xmath16 . goad & roberts noted how this tapering effect may , in opaque edge  on disks , yield observed rotation curves resembling solid  body behavior , independently of the true shape of @xmath7 .",
    "bosma ( 1992 ) tested this technique on two edge  on systems , ngc 100 and ngc 891 .",
    "they compared hi synthesis and  observations and concluded that the disk of ngc 100 is transparent , while in the case of ngc 891 they could not exclude the possibility of extinction in the inner parts of the disk .",
    "their conclusions were however strongly influenced by the limited spatial resolution of the hi data .",
    "prada ( 1994 ) compared long  slit spectra of ngc 2146 in the optical and near ir and reported evidence for extinction in the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "more recently , giovanelli & haynes ( 2002 , hereafter gh02 ) applied the same technique in a statistical fashion , detecting clear evidence for the effect of extinction at 0.66 . using a sample of more than 2000  rotation curves",
    ", they found that the opacity in the inner disks of spiral galaxies is luminosity dependent , in a manner previously found by purely photometric means ( giovanelli 1995 ; tully 1998 ) .",
    "the observational data of gh02 are corroborated by the detailed radiative transfer calculations of baes et al.(2004 ) , which also obtain dramatic increases in the apparent inner scale length of rotations curves as disks approach the edge  on perspective .    in this report",
    ", we use a simple model for the dust gas distribution in spiral disks , in order to reproduce the findings of gh02 and in so doing to obtain quantitative inferences on the characteristics of the disk opacity . in section 2",
    "we summarize the observational results that are to be modelled . in section 3",
    "we describe the disk model to be fitted to the data , while the best fit parameters are discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions . throughout this work ,",
    "distance dependent quantities are scaled according to a hubble parameter @xmath17 .",
    "gh02 fitted /[nii ] rotation curves of spiral galaxies with the parametric model v_pe = v_(1-e^-r/ r_pe)(1+r/ r_pe ) [ vpe ] where @xmath18 scales the amplitude of the rotation curve , @xmath19 yields a scale length for the inner steep rise , and @xmath0 corresponds to the slope at large @xmath8 . in their table 1 , for different luminosity classes as measured in the i  band they list mean values of @xmath0 , @xmath20 and of the ratio between @xmath21 and the scale length of the disk light for relatively face  on systems . in their figure 1 , for each luminosity class the dependence of @xmath20 on disk inclination @xmath10 is shown . for a given luminosity class , with increasing @xmath10 , @xmath22 remains at first constant ; as @xmath10 approaches @xmath23 , @xmath22 starts increasing , the rate of increase being larger for more luminous systems . in the latter , @xmath22 at high inclination",
    "has values more than double the values observed at low inclination .",
    "the inclination dependence was interpreted as due to the increase in the opacity of spiral disks with inclination , while the luminosity dependence was attributed to a combination of increased disk size and higher interstellar medium metallicities in the more luminous systems . by contrast , the outer slope @xmath24 is unaffected by disk inclination .",
    "as done by other authors who have studied disk extinction models ( e.g ( byun  1994 ; xilouris  1999 ; misiriotis  2000 ) , we assume that the emissivity per unit volume is produced in the disk by a distribution of isotropic emitters which is exponential both in the radial direction @xmath8 in the plane of the disk , and in the direction @xmath1 perpendicular to it , so that j(r , z)=j _   e^-r / r_d   e^-|z|/z_d [ eqj ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the scale length and the scale height , and we ignore the effects of clumpiness and azimuthal variations",
    ". we will need to distinguish between scale lengths and scale heights of stars , dust and emitting regions , respectively referred to by subscripts `` * '' , `` d '' and `` @xmath0 '' .",
    "we will assume that the dust distribution in the disk is exponential both in @xmath8 and @xmath1 , with scale length and scale height of the dust as those of the  light at @xmath5 @xmath6 m .",
    "that assumption greatly simplifies the analysis ; it is justified since the light distribution in our case is that of the  produced in star forming regions , which is likely to mimick that of dust clouds .",
    "it is however a simplistic assumption , which can not fully reproduce the more complex characteristics of the distribution of star  forming regions in galaxies .",
    "we use it here because of its simplicity , and discuss later some of its possible limitations . the absorption coefficient per unit volume for an exponential distribution",

    "gh02 derived axial ratios from i  band surface photometry , a band for which the light originates in late disk stars ; the @xmath35 of that light is very likely to be significantly larger than that of the dust and of the star  forming regions . in giovanelli ( 1994,1995 )",
    "they derived a value of @xmath35 of 0.13 for the i  band .",
    "the largest data sets of  surface photometry are those of ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) and koopmann , kenney & young ( 2001 ) .",
    "ryder and dopita have compared stellar and   scale lengths , showing the latter to be significantly larger than the former ; from their figures 4 and 5 , we infer @xmath36 , where the stellar scale length corresponds to the i  band .",
    "the contribution to the observed flux along a given line of sight by a parcel of gas at location @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "the  line profile along a given line of sight through the disk will be @xmath38 , where @xmath28 is mapped onto the line of sight velocity , given a rotation curve @xmath7 .",
    "in analogy with the measurement practice by which the rotation curve of a disk is extracted from a slit positioned along the disk major axis , in our model we assign to each line of sight the velocity corresponding to the peak of the simulated  line profile .",

    "* by progressively changing the inclination angle of the disk , we obtain a curve that describes the change of @xmath20 with @xmath40 , which we compare with the observed data as shown in figure 1 of gh02 . in order to show the dependence with @xmath40 in the observed data , we use the eqn .",

    "the procedure yields a best fit of unconstrained values for @xmath30 , @xmath39 and @xmath2 , or best fit values of any of those parameters , when the others are constrained . since gh02 express the disk inclination in terms of the axial ratio of the starlight in the i  band , we use eqn .",

    "the gh02 analysis of rotation curves separates the available sample in six luminosity classes .",

    "figure 2 displays the analogous model curves for luminosity class ii , for which we have assumed @xmath61 kpc and @xmath56 . in all panels , the intersection of the horizontal dashed line and",
    "the rotation curve identifies the corresponding value of @xmath19 for that curve .",
    "note how even for disks of moderate opacity , the value of the rotational velocity within a few scale lengths from the center can be drastically altered by extinction , in the case of highly inclined and luminous systems .",
    "figure 3 shows the gh02 data on the variation of @xmath20 with inclination , and the corresponding model trends as derived from our disk extinction model , for varying values of @xmath2 ( 1 to 10 , @xmath62 ) . in each case ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath63 are the same values used in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the models plotted with a thick line correspond to @xmath64 .    in order to verify the variance in the best fit value @xmath2",
    "produced by different values of the assumed @xmath39 , figure 4 shows the data for the two luminosity classes and , separately , simulated @xmath20 vs. @xmath45 relations for @xmath2 between 1 and 10 and for @xmath65 ( panels a , d ) , 0.05 ( panels b , e ) and 0.07 ( panels c , f ) .",
    "similarly , figure 5 shows the variance introduced by different assumptions on the dust disk scale length @xmath63 : for @xmath66 , the model curves were computed for @xmath67 kpc ( panel a ) , 8.0 kpc ( panel b ) , and 9.0 kpc ( panel c ) for luminosity class i , and 5.5 kpc ( panel d ) , 6.5 kpc ( panel e ) and 7.5 kpc ( panel f ) for luminosity class ii . for given @xmath2 , disk inclination and @xmath30 , a higher value of @xmath39 implies that extinction along a given path length involves a wider interval of disk radii , thus resulting in a more `` smeared '' rotation curve ( i.e. longer @xmath46 ) .",
    "similarly , for given @xmath2 , disk inclination and @xmath39 , a longer dust scale length also implies that extinction along a given path length involves a wider interval of disk radii , thus a longer @xmath46 .",
    "both effects are seen in the simulations .",
    "unconstrained fits of the type described by equation ( 6 ) can yield simultaneously values for @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , values of @xmath39 and @xmath30 are not independent : lengthening the disk will obviously reduce its axial ratio .",
    "we can thus maintain @xmath68 and/or @xmath69 fixed and obtained constrained fit values for @xmath70 for each luminosity class .",
    "what is a reasonable range of values for @xmath69 and @xmath68 ?",
    "while photometric measurements provide a fair assessment of the mean and variance in the value of @xmath71 for a given luminosity class ( the scatter about the observed mean values is approximately 0.08 in @xmath72 ) , the distribution in disk intrinsic axial ratios is quite uncertain , for @xmath35 is a difficult quantity to measure and even its mean value for a given type of galaxy relies on poorly constrained statistical inferences from the observed distribution of axial ratios and from a few observations of edge  on systems .",
    "the mean value of @xmath73 was adopted by giovanelli ( 1994 ) for the i band .",
    "the extreme disk population of star forming regions and dust should be significantly thinner than that of the solar  type disk stars contributing most of the light at i band .",
    "ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) give a comparison between @xmath57 and @xmath74 , which we assumed to be the same as @xmath30 .",
    "no equally accessible comparison between @xmath35 and @xmath39 is available . in table 1 , we give estimates of @xmath2 obtained assuming the tabulated values for @xmath30 and @xmath39 , based on the ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) data and heuristic assumptions on the dust layer intrinsic axial ratio .",
    "the error assigned to this determination is based on a combination of ( a ) the standard error propagation analysis derived from the impact of the gh02 data quality , ( b ) uncertainty in the conversion of @xmath57 to @xmath30 , estimated to be 20% on the basis of the ryder & dopita data , and ( c ) uncertainty in the value of @xmath39 , assumed to hover between 0.035 and 0.06 for both luminosity classes .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty is clearly that deriving from @xmath39 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is introduced by the often  seen departures from an exponential form , in the radial distribution of  especially near the centers of galaxies :",
    "a cursory inspection of the ryder & dopita and the koopmann  samples indicates that about half of galaxies exhibit a cusp in the  distribution , within the inner 12 kpc .",
    "this region coincides with that within which @xmath19 is measured .",
    "thus , values of @xmath2 inferred with the assumption that the radial distribution of , and thus of dust , is exponential throughout the disk may underestimate the opacity of the inner regions of the disk and overestimate it in the outer regions . while it is clear that extinction plays a role in affecting the shape of the inner parts of   rotation curves of bright spirals , the technique outlined in this paper for its measurement requires higher quality estimates of the distribution of absorbers than currently available , for @xmath2 to be pinned down to better than within a factor of 2 or so .",
