    "here we compare analytical and numerical results from a three - level multiphoton analysis to rabi oscillation experiments performed on a dc squid phase qubit .",
    "we develop analytical results to describe the basic rabi frequencies ( the oscillation frequency between energy levels ) and ac stark shifts ( the shift of the optimal resonance condition with applied power ) of the device , which are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "in addition to confirming the physics of the superconducting phase qubit , these results are important for situations where fast qubit operations are performed and for high - precision applications .",
    "the josephson phase qubit is simply a hysteretic current - biased josephson junction that is well - isolated from dissipation in its leads @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the gauge - invariant phase difference , @xmath3 its conjugate momentum , @xmath4 the junction s critical current , @xmath5 its capacitance , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "here we consider a time - dependent bias current @xmath8 .",

    "to describe multiphoton processes ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) we transform the schrdinger equation to an interaction picture using the time - dependent diagonal operator @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the number of photons involved in the @xmath28 transition . in the interaction - picture",
    "the new hamiltonian is @xmath29 by using the bessel - function identity @xmath30 and averaging @xmath31 over one period @xmath32 of the drive one obtains the multiphoton rotating wave hamiltonian @xmath33 : @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41",

    "thus , this matrix element can typically be neglected .    in this three - level approach , about each transition there will be an avoided crossing of two of the eigenvalues .",
    "these avoided crossings indicate that oscillations between the original energy levels will occur , and with a frequency given by the eigenvalue difference .",

    "this shift of the optimal transition point is known as the ac stark shift in atomic physics , and has the characteristic dependence @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the frequency difference of the off - resonant transition ( here @xmath75 ) and the drive ( here @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 the characteristic matrix element .",
    "in addition , the minimal rabi frequency is actually decreased from its nominal value of @xmath66 : @xmath78 ^ 2}{4 ( \\omega_{01}-\\omega_{12})^2 } \\right ) .",

    "for these expressions to be valid , the condition @xmath84 must be met .",

    "the solid curve is the three - level prediction , with no fitting parameters , while the dashed curve is the perturbative result ( [ stark1 ] ) .",
    "we see good agreement with the three - level results , even for powers where the perturbative result fails .",
    "finally , the rabi frequency of the two - photon @xmath79 transition is shown in fig .",
    "the solid curve is the three - level prediction while the dashed curve is the approximation ( [ rabi3 ] ) . for small powers , the experimental results are likely dominated by systematic errors in the tunneling rate measurements . for large powers",
    "we find that while the perturbative result fails , the full three - level prediction is in excellent quantitative agreement with the data .",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the behavior of the superconducting phase qubit when irradiated with microwaves at high power .",
    "we have identified two effects that are new to this qubit : multiphoton rabi oscillations and the ac stark shifts .",
    "we have also shown that a simple three - level theory can explain , with minimal fitting parameters , both of these subtle experimental effects .",
    "this is quite remarkable , as dissipation , decoherence , and tunneling are all signficant in the same parameter regime for these devices .",
    "finally , these results indicate that high - power rabi oscillations can in principle be used to characterize all of the relevant matrix elements needed for high - fidelity microwave control of superconducting phase qubits .",
