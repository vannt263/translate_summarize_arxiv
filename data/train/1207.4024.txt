    "one of the greatest mysteries in cosmology today is the nature of dark energy in the universe . according to the concordance cosmology , this makes up around @xmath1 of the total energy density of the universe and causes the universe to accelerate around the present epoch @xcite . yet",
    ", there is no strong theoretical as well as observational indication to pin point the nature of this dark component .",
    "in fact we still do not know whether the mysterious late time acceleration is due to the presence of dark energy or due to any modification of gravitational laws on large scales .    nevertheless , majority of the observational data @xcite support the concordance @xmath0cdm model as a possible explanation for the late time acceleration . in this model ,",
    "the presence of the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) poses two serious problems .",
    "first one is related to the fine tuning of the value of @xmath0 to a ridiculously small number ( @xmath2 in natural units ) necessary for the present day cosmic acceleration .",
    "the other one is related to its dominance over the matter component of the universe precisely at the present epoch .",
    "any small departure from these two conditions will result in a cosmological evolution that is different from the observable universe .",
    "these conceptual problems dilute the superiority , the @xmath0cdm model enjoys over other dark energy models as far as observational results are concerned .",
    "interestingly , current observational data also allow deviation from the @xmath0cdm behaviour .",
    "dark energy models with @xmath3 are also allowed by current observations @xcite .",
    "although the allowed deviation from @xmath4 is not large , but it is still detectable at the precision levels of current and future observational set ups . hence efforts are on to construct models that can explain this deviation .",
    "almost all the approaches for this purpose , assume that @xmath0 is exactly zero in our universe , and an evolving dark energy is solely responsible for the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "this includes possibilities likes quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , an arbitrary barotropic fluid like chaplygin gas or its various generalization and many more @xcite .",
    "all these models are generally phenomenological without any strong theoretical motivations and they also burden us with the challenge of explaining several other model parameters .    the other option is to assume the existence of a small but non - zero @xmath0 as in @xmath0cdm model but also to consider some extra component to explain the observed deviation from @xmath0cdm behaviour @xcite .",
    "this may be motivated by the fact that string - landscape model may explain the existence of a small but non zero @xmath0 in our present universe @xcite .",
    "but it is important to have well motivated candidate that can explain the deviation from @xmath0cdm ; otherwise this approach will have the same shortcomings which are present in standard dark energy models mentioned above .    in this study",
    ", we propose one such model .",
    "there are models where dark energy is assumed to be a perfect fluid having equation of state @xmath5 . but one major problem for such models is due to its sound velocity @xmath6 which causes instabilities on the small scales .",
    "it was then proposed to include rigidity in the fluid to make it an elastic solid @xcite . in this case , if the rigidity is sufficiently large , @xmath7 even if @xmath8 .",
    "a solid perfect fluid can arise in different theories .",
    "one such possibility is the network of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "these are topological defects that are predicted to be formed during the phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "cosmologically they are interesting because if such string configurations are allowed in any particle physics models , they will eventually form string network and may survive till today . hence detecting these cosmic strings can give us important clues about physics at very high energy scales .",
    "if they exist , they can have effects on cmb anisotropies @xcite , early reionizations @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite as well as in cosmological 21 cm observations @xcite .",
    "one can put observational bound on the gravitational interaction of these strings through dimensionless quantity @xmath9 where @xmath10 is newton s constant and @xmath11 is the tension of the string .",
    "the latest bound on this parameter as provided by the planck measurement @xcite is @xmath12 .",
    "if these strings are produced during the phase transition at the electroweak scale , they can be very light .",
    "but there can be many such strings and their combined energy density can be finite .",
    "one interesting feature in the evolution of string network is the intercommutation . through this process long strings",
    "can be cut into smaller strings as well as in loops which evaporate into gravitational waves . at the end of this intercommutation ,",
    "the string network approaches a scaling regime where the string energy density exactly scales as @xmath13 in the matter dominated era or @xmath14 in the radiation dominated era .",
    "this has been shown in the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , strings can never accelerate the universe .    on contrary ,",
    "if the strings do not intercommute or pass through each other , then the network can be frozen in comoving coordinates .",
    "these are called fraustrated network of strings .",
    "such network of strings will have the equation of state @xmath15 and hence their energy density will go as @xmath16 .",
    "a phase transition around few tev and a string separation today of the order of few a.u . will result @xmath17 today in the range of 0 and 1@xcite .",
    "so a universe containing fraustrated network of cosmic strings may result in a possible deviation from @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we shall show in our subsequent study that a small but non zero contribution from this string network can be sufficient for this purpose .",
    "we should also mention that although the existence of these strings networks in cosmological scales are still not confirmed , they can be seen in the condensed matter systems like biaxial nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "obviously the question is whether in any reasonable particle physics model , we get a fraustrated network of strings .",
    "usually the equation of state of a cosmic string network is related to its root - mean squared ( rms ) velocity as @xcite    @xmath18    as we have discussed in the previous paragraphs , for a fraustrated network of cosmic strings @xmath19 .",
    "this can be achieved under the limit @xmath20 .",
    "it was shown by several numerical simulations that abelian string networks intercommute and give rise to scaling solution without fraustration @xcite .",
    "but later on it was shown that in non - abelian string network , intercommutation may be prevented due to topological constraints and stable fraustrated network of strings may form @xcite .",
    "more recent numerical simulations show that in the string dominated universe @xmath21 @xcite and can never be exactly zero for nonintercommutating strings . in this case",
    ", the string network can never be conformally stretched to the hubble scale preventing them to fraustrate .",
    "this can only be achieved if one includes some additional fraustration mechanisms to keep the velocity small .",
    "this has been discussed by sousa and avelino @xcite .",
    "presence of a massive junction @xcite or a conserved charge @xcite can result such fraustration .",
    "but for this the energy density of background matter ( radiation or dust ) should also dominate over the cosmic string energy density ( that includes the contribution from the fraustration mechanism ) and hence this string network alone can never accelerate the universe @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we shall abandon the idea of fraustration and consider scenarios that are more similar to the numerical simulations on string networks ( we should rely on this simulations till we detect cosmic strings ) . in other words",
    ", we shall assume the form for @xmath22 as described by equation ( 1 ) and also consider non zero @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we should stress that in the absence of any actual observational knowledge for string network , this may be a reasonable assumption .    in this scenario",
    ", we want to see whether a small contribution from such a cosmic string network is allowed by the observational data , that can result observable deviation from the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "there is also another simple way that can give a string - like term ( @xmath16 ) in the hubble equation .",
    "a fluid with a constant negative pressure ( @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being a positive constant ) behaves like a @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this can be easily seen by putting the constant @xmath27 in the energy conservation equation @xmath28 and then integrate it out to obtain the expression for @xmath29 .",
    "let us write the small deviation from the @xmath0cdm behaviour around present day ( @xmath30 ) by taylor expanding around this constant @xmath27 behaviour :    @xmath31    where we keep terms upto second order in @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . with this one",
    "can integrate the energy conservation equation to get the expression for energy density and pressure as a function of scale factor : @xmath37    here @xmath38 is an arbitrary integration constant . for the choice @xmath39 and @xmath40 , these gives a mixture of fluids containing @xmath0 , matter and a fraustrated network of cosmic strings .",
    "obviously this particular choice of relation between @xmath33 and @xmath34 has no underlying theoretical reason , but depicts a simple way of attaining a string - like equation of state in the frw universe .",
    "hereafter we consider a mixture of fluids consisting a dust like matter ( with @xmath41 ) , a cosmological constant ( @xmath42 ) and a string network with equation of state given by equation ( 1 ) and discuss its various cosmological implications .",
    "we start with the einstein equations :    @xmath43   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here subscript `` 0 '' means values at present ( @xmath30 , @xmath44 ) , @xmath22 is the equation of state for the network of strings .",
    "flatness condition demands that @xmath45 ; hence two of these parameters are independent",
    ". henceforth we shall consider @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the equation of state for the combined dark energy fluid ( @xmath0+cosmic string ) is now given by    @xmath48    later , we reconstruct this dark energy equation of state , @xmath49 , to see how much deviation from @xmath50 is allowed by the current cosmological observations .",
    "with this dark energy set up , we use the present observational data to constrain our model .",
    "we begin by considering the type ia supernovae observation which probes directly the cosmological expansion .",
    "these observations measure the apparent luminosity of the supernova explosion as observed by an observer on earth . in cosmological terms , this is given by luminosity distance @xmath51 defined as    @xmath52    using this , we evaluate the distance modulus @xmath11 ( which is an observable quantity ) as @xmath53 where m and m are the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the supernovae respectively .",
    "we consider the latest union2.1 data compilation @xcite consisting of 580 data points for the observable @xmath11 .",
    "next , we use the observational constraints on hubble parameter as available in the literature .",
    "recently moresco et al .",
    "@xcite have compiled the hubble parameter measurements in the redshift range @xmath54 using the differential evolution of the cosmic chronometers .",
    "they have built a sample of 18 observational data point for @xmath55 spanning almost @xmath56 gyr of cosmic evolution .",
    "these values are given in table 1 . to complete the data set",
    ", we also use the latest and the most precise measurement of the hubble constant @xmath57 @xcite .",
    ".@xmath55 measurements ( in units [ @xmath58 ) and their errors . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "cosmological observations have now confirmed the late time acceleration of the universe . the challenge is to explain the source of this acceleration . although a concordance @xmath0cdm model is consistent with different observational results , a small deviation from this @xmath0cdm behaviour",
    "is also allowed .",
    "moreover recent results also show that there may be some inconsistencies between different observational results if one assumes @xmath0cdm as the correct cosmological model @xcite .",
    "this motivates people to consider scenarios slightly different from an exact @xmath0cdm behaviour .    in most of these scenarios , one assumes the @xmath0 term to be exactly zero and introduces dynamical scalar fields that can give rise to late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "all these models are phenomenological in nature and lacks theoretical understanding ( see @xcite for recent attempt to build a quintessence model in string theory ) .",
    "they not only inherit the problems present in the concordance @xmath0cdm model , but also burden us with a number of extra parameters which also have to be fine tuned .",
    "we should also stress the fact that except the recently discovered higgs field in large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , no other scalar field has been detected so far that can explain this late time acceleration .",
    "this motivates us to look for alternative approaches that may explain the deviation from the @xmath0cdm evolution .",
    "formation of cosmic string network is possible during phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "although , on cosmological scales , we have not detected these strings so far , but they are more commonly observed in condensed matter systems in the laboratory . keeping this is mind , we propose a cosmological model where a small contribution from cosmic strings network is present in the energy budget of the universe together with the cosmological constant and other usual matter components .",
    "one can consider this network of strings as a perfect gas @xcite and express the overall equation of state @xmath22 as a function of its average velocity @xmath23 .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that this average velocity can not be exactly zero but is constrained to be @xmath24 .",
    "we show that such a model is completely consistent with current observational data .",
    "we put constraint on the model parameters like @xmath47 and @xmath46 . subsequently calculating bayesian evidence ,",
    "we show that statistically data still prefer strongly a model with simple cosmological constant and this result does not change much with the choice of prior .",
    "to conclude , if the deviation from the @xmath0cdm evolution is indeed confirmed , cosmological constant with a small contribution from cosmic string network may explain such deviation . at the theoretical level",
    ", we believe this set up has similar appeal as in scalar field models as both can arise in reasonable particle physics set up though neither has been detected so far . but given the fact that cosmic strings formation has been observed in condensed matter system , and numerical simulations on the dynamics of string networks on cosmological scales have revealed a lot about their properties , if detected , they may be a good alternative to scalar field dark energy models .",
