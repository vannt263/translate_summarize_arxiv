    "it is generally believed that there are two important qcd phase transitions in hot and dense nuclear matter .",
    "one of them is related to the deconfinement process in moving from a hadron gas to a quark - gluon plasma , and the other one describes the transition from the chiral symmetry breaking phase to the phase in which it is restored .",
    "furthermore , it appears from lattice simulations of qcd that both transitions coincide at a temperature of about @xmath0 mev at zero baryon density(hwa 1990 ) .",
    "the transitions may happen in the early universe and the early stage of relativistic heavy - ion collisions where the temperature is expected to be extremely high .",
    "the other often considered systems to realize the transition condition are compact stars where the temperature is low but the baryon density can reach several times the normal nuclear density ( glendenning 2000 ) . from the recent lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "the phase structure at high density is much more rich than that at high temperature .",
    "apart from the quark deconfinement and chiral restoration , there may be pion superfluidity ( kogut & sinclair 2002;he , jin , & zhuang 2005 ) and even color superconductivity ( alford , rajagopal , & wilczek 1998)in compact stars .",
    "different from the temperature effect which leads to a second order phase transition or even only a crossover , the qcd phase transitions at high baryon density are all of first order ( karsch 2002 ) which can help us to extract signatures in experiments easily .",
    "the signatures of a qcd phase transition that happened in a compact star depends strongly on the structure of the star , namely the equation of state of the star .",
    "normally , a compact star is considered to be completely in a new state of matter , and a bag constant is needed to balance the pressure on the surface of the star ( glendenning 2000 ) . in this case , there is no phase transition inside the star , and the signatures reflect only the properties of the new state of matter .",
    "if a phase transition occurs inside a compact star , the sudden change in the equation of state at the critical point of the first order phase transition may lead to some easily observable signatures .",
    "these signatures are connected to the phase transition itself and different from those related only to the new state of matter .",
    "neutrinos play an important role in the study on compact stars ( bethe 1990;,qian et al.1993;prakash et al.1997;yakovlev",
    "et al.2001 ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the neutrino conversion in a compact star in the frame of an effective qcd model with chiral symmetry .",
    "while it is generally believed that the neutrino oscillation is difficult to occur in compact stars ( bethe 1990 ) , the situation may be changed when the transition from chiral restoration phase to chiral breaking phase is taken into account .",
    "we will show that a sudden drop of the electron density associated with the first order chiral phase transition leads to an remarkable neutrino oscillation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we describe the chiral thermodynamics in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in mean field approximation and then by considering the electric charge neutrality constraint we associate the chiral properties with the inner structure of a compact star via the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we study the effect of chiral phase transition on the neutrino oscillation through the neutrino propagation in the star .",
    "we summarize and discuss the obtained results in section [ s4 ] .",
    "we use the natural unit of @xmath1 through the paper .",
    "the study on qcd phase diagrams depends on lattice qcd calculations and effective models with qcd symmetries .",
    "since there is not yet precise lattice result at finite baryon density due to the fermion sign problem(karsch 2002 ) , the structure of chiral phase transition at moderate baryon density is mainly investigated in many low energy effective models .",
    "one of the models that enables us to see directly how the dynamical mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration operate is the njl model(nambu & jona - lasinio 1961 ) applied to quarks ( vogl & weise 1991;klevansky 1992;volkov 1993;hatsuda & kunihiro 1994 ; buballa 2005 ) .",
    "recently , the trapped neutrino effect on the structure of neutron star was investigated in this model(menezes , providencia , & melrose 2006 ; ruster et al .",
    "we describe the equation of state of the start with the two flavor njl model defined by the lagrangian density(vogl & weise 1991;klevansky 1992;volkov 1993;hatsuda & kunihiro 1994;buballa 2005 ) @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the current quark mass , @xmath4 the effective coupling constant , and @xmath5 the chemical potential matrix in flavor space , @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the baryon and electron chemical potential , respectively .",

    ", we consider in the following chiral limit of the njl model with @xmath25 .",
    "there are only two parameters in the model , the coupling constant @xmath4 and the hard momentum cutoff @xmath26 to regulate the model . by fitting the pion decay constant and chiral condensate in the vacuum ,",
