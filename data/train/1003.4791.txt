    "one of the most serious problems in planet formation is how the dust components grow up to larger objects in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the known key - stage is when the dust particles are meter - size @xcite .",
    "since gas pressure gradient in a protoplanetary disk is negative , gas rotates at sub - keplerian velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust particles tend to rotate at keplerian velocity and therefore they feel headwind of gas . losing their angular momenta , they spiral into a central star quickly on timescales of  100 years .",
    "one possibility to overcome the meter - size barrier is the planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse of a cluster composed with small dust particles @xcite .",
    "the dust would settle to midplane in the absence of turbulence .",
    "early studies of dust settling in turbulent accretion disks were carried out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they presented that large dust particles settle down toward their equilibrium distribution in a turbulent diffusive time scale while small ones remain mixed throughout the whole gas disk .",
    "if dust density in midplane becomes high enough , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities between a sediment layer of dust and the overlying gas can drive turbulence and mix the dust layer enough to prevent gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , carried out two - dimensional simulation and found active turbulent concentration .",
    "except the effect of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , the high dust density in midplane leads to a streaming instability @xcite because the dust is susceptible to preferential radial migration relative to the gas @xcite .",
    "the streaming instability was shown to lead to turbulence and concentrate dust particles locally @xcite .",
    "as one of other mechanisms of turbulent concentration , the effect of the turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) is recognized .",
    "planetesimal formation by gravitational instability in the mri turbulence is addressed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "turbulence level is the most fundamental parameter governing whether planetesimals can form by gravitational instability in these models .",
    "the turbulence level of mri depends on the ionization degree of disk gas and the strength of magnetic field .",
    "the linear analysis showed that the growth rate of mri is reduced by ohmic diffusion when collisions are so frequent that not only the ions and neutrals are well coupled but also electrical currents are damped @xcite . at the same time , the growth wavelength becomes longer and transport rate of angular momentum is diminished .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the mri in nonideal mhd starting from the weak vertical magnetic field has been studied by @xcite .",
    "they found that sustained mhd turbulence requires the magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are alfven velocity , magnetic resistivity and keplerian rotation frequency .",
    "the values of @xmath2 are regulated by an ionization structure in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the inner regions of a disk are thermally ionized @xcite . at greater distances from the disk center , stellar x - rays and diffuse cosmic rays ionize the surface gas layer down to a certain column density @xcite . in moderately distant regions in which disk column density is high enough , midplane layers are not highly ionized and mri could be inactive there .",
    "this region is called `` dead zone '' @xcite .",
    "the characteristics and interesting physics are prospective around dead zones .",
    "the magnetic turbulence outside the dead zone , which transports angular momentum and mass , creates gas density bump at the outer boundary of the dead zone .",
    "this density pile - up triggers the rossby wave @xcite to form long - life anticyclonic vortices .",
    "@xcite suggested that the dust particles are trapped in a center of vortex . by numerical simulation of rossby vortices including solid particles , @xcite confirmed the enhancement of dust density there .",
    "@xcite showed that gravitationally bound embryos can form in the regions of enhanced dust density .",
    "* ; hereafter referred to as paper i ) showed that non - uniform excitation of mri creates angular velocity profile that consists of super and sub - keplerian regions locally in the disk ( for details , see section 2 ) .",
    "it is expected that this radial structure of the angular velocity leads to prevention of spiral - in of dust particles and their accumulation at the boundary of super and sub - keplerian regions , since the super - keplerian flow pushes the dust particles outward while the sub - keplerian flow drags them inward .",
    "this interesting mechanism is based on the co - existence of mri active and inactive regions .",
    "the ionization degree that regulates mri depends on the relative abundance and size distribution of grains @xcite .",
    "it can also be changed by phase chemistry @xcite .",
    "slight changes in these quantities near boundaries at global active / dead zones of mri may create the local inhomogenity in mri growth .",
    "we will address this issue in a subsequent paper .",
    "note that the local model in this paper is not a toy model that mimics the global inhomogeneous structure of dead and active zones .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate dust accumulation induced by inhomogeneous mri evolution by three - dimensional non - ideal mhd simulation including dust particles .",
    "the dust particles are represented by lagrangian particles suffering gas drag and are assumed not to affect on gas .",
    "we consider both cases with radially non - uniform magnetic resistivity under uniform magnetic field direction and non - uniform magnetic field with radially uniform magnetic resistivity .",
    "mri develops in low resistivity regions in the former case and in strong vertical magnetic field regions in the latter case .",
    "the latter model is the same as the model adopted in paper i. we briefly summarize the results of paper i in section  [ sec : paper1 ] .",
    "we explain our simulation setting in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : result ] , we present that the mri leads to quasi - steady state and particles are locally concentrated as expected .",
    "we also analyze the distributions of particle radial velocity to understand the effect of weak remnant magnetic turbulence .",
    "we examine how high the particle density enhancement is and the possibility of planetesimal formation via gravitational instability .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss their implications in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in paper i , we have studied how the angular velocity profile of gas is modified when mri is excited non - uniformly in a part of a disk .",
    "local two - dimensional simulations ( in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are radial and vertical coordinates to the disk ) with the shearing box boundary conditions were performed .",
    "we assumed the ionization degree of the gas to be relatively low .",
    "the vertical component to the disk plane ( @xmath5 component ) of magnetic field was changed along the radial direction ( @xmath4 ) while the absolute values of the field is constant . in the part of a disk where the ionization degree is low ( equivalently ,",
    "resistivity is high ) , mri is active only in the regions with relatively large vertical component of the magnetic field .",
    "one of the models used in the present paper has the same setting but with three - dimensional simulations , while the other model in the present paper assumes non - uniform resistivity with uniform magnetic field .    the most illustrative result of paper i is shown in figure  [ fig : paper1 ] .",
    "time evolution ( @xmath6 ) of vertically averaged pressure and angular velocity of gas is plotted in panels a and b. mri is excited only in the initially unstable region ( @xmath7 ) with large enough initial vertical field and vigorous angular momentum and mass transport occurs within the unstable zone . when the magnetic perturbations are propagated to the initially stable regions ( @xmath8 ) , they are dissipated via resistivity and the large part of the stable region remains undisturbed .",
    "hereafter , we call the initially mri stable and unstable regions simply as `` stable '' and `` unstable '' regions , respectively . after the vigorous angular momentum and mass transfer , a new quasi - steady state with the local rigid rotation feature appears in the unstable region ( figure  [ fig : paper1]b )",
    ". the pressure profile of the gas is also modulated ( figure  [ fig : paper1]a ) . the rigid rotation feature that appears in the saturated quasi - steady state is sustained by the modified pressure pattern with its two peaks located around the unstable - stable boundary regions and its bottom located in the middle of the unstable zone . the quasi - steady rigid rotation pattern results in super - keplerian angular velocity at the outer part of the unstable region .",
    "since the gas in the stable region is unperturbed and remains sub - keplerian when the global pressure gradient is taken into account , one finds that super- and sub - keplerian zones co - exist in the part of the disk due to the non - uniform excitation of mri .",
    "the co - existence of super- and sub - keplerian zones has significant implication for the dust particle dynamics in a disk .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the dust particles feel headwind and migrate inward in the sub - keplerian gas flow . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust particles feel tailwind and migrate outward in the super - keplerian zone . then at a boundary between sub- and super - keplerian zones , with the super - keplerian zone situated on the inner side , which is indeed seen at the outer edge of the unstable region , the inward migration of dust particles through the sub - keplerian zone ( the stable zone )",
    "are halted .",
    "the boundary region potentially acts as a barrier for the dust infall and furthermore as the focal annulus of the dust particle concentration which may eventually lead to planetesimal formation .",
    "the widths of the stable and unstable regions are one of the key parameters that determine the characteristics of the final state .",
    "we have found that the final state is classified by the spatially averaged magnetic reynolds number in the initial condition , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is @xmath5 component of alfven velocity",
    ". if @xmath11 is less than unity , a quasi - steady state with the local super - keplerian rotation appears .",
    "the turbulence level within the stable region and at the boundary varies according to @xmath11 .",
    "the degree of dust concentration at the boundary region would be affected by the level of turbulence . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the magnetic perturbations are not dissipated enough within the stable region and the velocity pattern undergoes perpetual changes without reaching a quasi - steady state .",
    "steady accumulation of dust particles is not expected in this case .",
    "note that our simulations with constant @xmath11 converge with increasing resolution , because the resistivity @xmath2 ( ohmic dissipation ) is explicitly included in our simulations and it is kept constant due to the constancy of @xmath11 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we address the following questions that arise from the results of paper i : ( 1 ) do dust particles truly concentrate at the boundary ?",
    "( 2 ) is the emergence of the quasi - steady rigid rotation region preserved in three - dimensional cases ? ( 3 ) how does remaining weak turbulence affect the dust concentration process ? ( 4 ) are dust particles concentrated dense enough on long enough timescales for subsequent gravitational instability to set in ?",
    "here we are concerned with a small region in a protoplanetary disk and study the local dynamics of gas and dust particles .",
    "the gas motion is calculated by resistive mhd simulations .",
    "the dust particles are modeled as test particles that move under the effects of the gravity from the central star and the gas drag .",
    "we adopt a local shearing box that has radial ( @xmath4 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath13 ) and vertical ( @xmath5 ) directions .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic in the @xmath13 and @xmath5 directions and the shearing box boundary condition is used in the @xmath4 direction @xcite .",
    "we calculate compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations given by @xmath14 ,   \\label{induction}\\\\ p&=&c^2_{s}\\rho , \\label{isothermal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a unit vector in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "we consider only the ohmic dissipation in equation  ( [ induction ] ) because influence of ambipolar diffusion is negligible at the density level that is expected in the inner ( @xmath16 ) midplane of a protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "the last terms in r.h.s . of equation  ( [ motion ] ) allows the effect of the global pressure gradient to be taken into account in our local model .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is related to the global pressure gradient as @xmath18 where we assume @xmath19 , with constant @xmath20 and an isothermal disk @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is disk scale height .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is treated as a constant parameter in our local model .",
    "we solve equation  ( [ induction ] ) with mocct method @xcite and the advection terms in equation  ( [ motion ] ) with cip method @xcite .",
    "the dust grains are treated as test particles .",
    "the equation of motion of the @xmath24-th particle is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gas velocity at the location of the @xmath24-th particle , which is interpolated with the three - dimensional first - order interpolation scheme by values of @xmath27 at the eight grid points surrounding the particle .",
    "the friction force , the last term in equation  ( [ particle ] ) , is proportional to the velocity difference between the dust and gas since the dust sizes that we are concerned with are in epstein and stokes drag - law regimes . the characteristic friction ( stopping ) timescale @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the dust particle radius , dust particle density and the sound speed , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 is the molecular viscosity and equal to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mean free path of the gas molecules . depending on the particle size relative to the mean free path ( @xmath36 ) the drag law changes from the epstein to the stokes regime .",
    "the scaled friction times of @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspond to the grain sizes of approximately 0.1 and 1 meter , respectively , at the radial location of jupiter in the minimum mass solar nebula model .",
    "all of our simulations start with uniform gas density ( @xmath39 ) and gas pressure ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the global gas pressure gradient is set to be @xmath41 .",
    "the initial gas angular velocity profile is given by unperturbed keplerian flow ( @xmath42 ) and a small reduction due to global gas pressure gradient ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 .",
    "initial disturbances are given to the gas radial velocity with the amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "test particles are initially orbiting at the kepler angular velocity .",
    "the particles move inward in the initial stage because they lose their angular momentum by the headwind that they feel due to the global pressure gradient .",
    "this is the dust infall problem described in introduction .",
    "initially 8 particles per gird are distributed . since typical grid",
    "we use is @xmath46 ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) , totally @xmath47 particles are distributed .",
    "the non - uniformity in the mri growth is set either by non - uniform resistivity ( case1 ) or non - uniform vertical ( @xmath5 ) component of the magnetic field ( case2 ) .",
    "we describe these cases in details in the following .      in case1 ,",
    "gas ionization degree is set to be radially inhomogeneous under the uniform magnetic field .",
    "the linear analysis for mri caused by vertical magnetic field shows that the larger resistivity makes unstable wavelength longer @xcite .",
    "the upper limit to the wavelength , @xmath48 , is scale height for actual disks while in our simulation , it is the size of the simulation box in the @xmath5 direction ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the critical value of resistivity with which the modes with wavelength shorter than @xmath48 can not grow is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the wave number corresponding @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath52 is the plasma beta . in our case",
    "there is no growing mode if the resistivity makes @xmath53 larger than @xmath49 .    in case1 , we set @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "resistivity varies in the radial direction such that mri grows only in a limited zone in the center of the simulation box . the resistivity distribution is not changed throughout runs .",
    "the radial distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : ini]a . in this paper ,",
    "the zone at the center where resistivity is initially sub - critical is referred to as the `` unstable '' region .",
    "the radial width of the stable and unstable regions are denoted by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we have performed only one simulation run for case1 , which will be called model-@xmath2 in the later sections .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] lists the parameter values used in the run .",
    "the set - up of case2 is the same as that in paper i except for three - dimensional simulations .",
    "the magnetic resistivity is uniform but the vertical component of magnetic field varies in the radial direction . that is , the initial magnetic field is situated as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the angle between the vertical axis and the magnetic field .",
    "the vertical magnetic component , or @xmath60 , determines whether the instability grows or not . for large @xmath60 ,",
    "vertical magnetic field is weak and short vertical wavelength modes grow faster . since",
    "such modes are dissipated by the ohmic dissipation effectively , the vertical field mri does not develop .",
    "the mri caused by the azimuthal magnetic field is known to grow rapidly with the limit of extremely short vertical wavelength in ideal mhd @xcite but the such short vertical wavelength modes tend to be damped resistively .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the azimuthal field mri growth ceases for the ionization degree higher than that stabilizes the vertical field mri .",
    "we also did not find the development of the azimuthal field mri in our simulation as long as the box size in the @xmath13 direction is expanded by a factor up to 3 from the nominal cases at least for about 20 orbits in which the gas velocity and dust density vary dramatically .",
    "the radial distribution of @xmath60 is shown in figure  [ fig : ini]b . here , @xmath61 , and the magnetic resistivity is @xmath62 .",
    "the larger vertical magnetic component in the center of the box makes mri locally unstable . outside the unstable zone",
    "the value of @xmath60 is smaller than the critical one and mri is stabilized .",
    "the two - dimensional version of case2 was studied in paper i , in which we found that if the spatially averaged magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 ( equation  ( [ rmave ] ) ) is small enough , the quasi - steady angular velocity profile that is deviated significantly from the keplerian is generated .",
    "since it is expected that this feature is preserved in three dimensional simulations and @xmath11 depends on the radial widths of the unstable region @xmath57 and the stable region @xmath56 , we investigate several cases with various @xmath56 while keeping @xmath63 in case2 : @xmath64(@xmath65 , model - s40 ) , @xmath66(@xmath67 , model - s11 ) , @xmath68(@xmath69 , model - s055 ) .",
    "note that two - dimensional calculations with the same @xmath56 and @xmath57 were performed in paper i.    in all of these cases , the friction time is set to be @xmath70 .",
    "to investigate the effects of the friction time , we set it to be @xmath71 in model - t01 , which has @xmath72 and @xmath64 ( the same as model - s40 ) .",
    "the initial settings are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "when the condition @xmath73 is met , the non - uniform growth of mri will create a new quasi - steady gas angular flow pattern that should affect the dust particle dynamics substantially ( paper i ) . at the same time",
    ", weak remnant turbulent flow may be superposed upon the quasi - steady pattern and would affect the dust motions , with its degree being dependent on the spatially averaged magnetic reynolds number .",
    "here we evaluate these two effects on the dust accumulation .",
    "we will be focusing on the @xmath4 component of the dust velocities @xmath74 .",
    "if the turbulence is small enough , as we have mentioned in section  [ sec : paper1 ] , the velocity difference in the @xmath13 component ( angular velocity ) between dust and gas is the determining factor for the assemblage of dust particles at the boundary between super and sub - keplerian zones . in order to quantitatively analyze the effect of the remnant turbulence , we divide the radial component of the particle velocity into two components : one is that due to the non - keplerian gas motion in the quasi - steady state achieved at the mri saturation and the other is that due to turbulence .",
    "the equation of motion for the dust velocity field at the grid point is @xmath75 we set @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a deviation from kepler flow .",
    "assuming @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) in @xmath4 and @xmath13 components and eliminating @xmath80 , the @xmath4 component of the particle velocity is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the gas angular velocity relative to keplerian velocity , @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the gas radial velocity due to turbulent viscosity .",
    "the component @xmath85 represents the particle velocity due to non - keplerian gas motion in the quasi - steady state , because it does not vanish even in the non - turbulence case , @xmath86 .",
    "although turbulence also contributes to @xmath85 , the contribution due to turbulence can be neglected compared with that due to the quasi - steady non - keplerian gas flow , except for strong turbulence case where the quasi - steady flow is not achieved .",
    "as we will show below , the component @xmath87 can be regarded as characteristic amplitude of the velocity dragged by turbulence , although @xmath87 changes with time due to the temporal change of @xmath74 and the assumption of @xmath78 is no more valid in the turbulent case .    later in this paper , @xmath85 and @xmath87",
    "will be calculated by equation  ( [ eq : turb ] ) , using gas velocity obtained by the mhd simulation , and they will be presented as a function of @xmath4 after azimuthal and vertical averaging . the ratio of the absolute values of the two is @xmath88 the turbulence effect is indicated by this ratio .",
    "it is stronger , if i ) turbulent flow is larger than the angular velocity difference @xmath82 , and/or ii ) the dust size ( @xmath89 ) is smaller . in the annulus where dust particles are expected to accumulate , @xmath90 and",
    "the ratio diverges .",
    "however , we will show below that this divergence is restricted only in narrow regions and the effect of turbulence does not prevent dust accumulation .",
    "we have set the global gas pressure gradient to be @xmath41 so that a direct comparison with the result by @xcite could be performed .",
    "this global pressure gradient , however , is less steep than in the minimum mass solar nebular model @xcite .",
    "a steeper global pressure gradient ( @xmath91 ) has at least three effects in the current context : ( 1 ) the baseline of gas velocity becomes lower than the keplerian velocity and it becomes more difficult to create super - keplerian regions whose outer - edges",
    "accumulate the dust particles .",
    "( 2 ) if a super - keplerian region appears , accumulation towards its outer - edge is faster ( @xmath85 is faster ) for steeper pressure gradient .",
    "this has a positive impact on the dust accumulation efficiency .",
    "( 3 ) the outer - edge of super - keplerian region would change its location according to the value of @xmath17 .",
    "the turbulence level at the focal annulus of dust accumulation varies accordingly .",
    "if the turbulence level is higher , it by itself has a negative impact . in case2",
    ", we have also carried out the runs with @xmath92 and found that the trapping of dust particles does occur and its efficiency is slightly higher .",
    "in the model-@xmath2 , the non - uniform excitation of mri is realized by non - uniform resistivity while the magnetic field is set uniform .",
    "the result of model-@xmath2 nicely illustrates our scenario for dust accumulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta-3d]a shows the evolution of mri .",
    "the black lines depict the magnetic field lines and the gray scale shows the gas radial velocity .",
    "the unstable region lies between two white lines ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "mri is first excited only in the initially unstable region ( see the plot at @xmath94 ) and significant angular momentum and mass are transported there .",
    "the mri turbulence intrudes into the stable region ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "deep inside the stable region , however , is always undisturbed ( @xmath96 ) because of the rapid dissipation by the enhanced resistivity .",
    "figures  [ fig : eta - puy]a and [ fig : eta - puy]b show the radial profiles of the pressure and the angular velocity of the gas , respectively .",
    "the quantities have been averaged azimuthally and vertically .",
    "the sampling times are @xmath97 0 , 40 , and 70 .",
    "the zone between the two vertical dotted lines is the unstable region .",
    "the inhomogeneous mri growth creates the rigid rotation pattern in the middle of the simulation box ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the pressure distribution is considerably modified such that the resultant pressure gradient force balances with the modified coriolis force .",
    "the flattened rotation profile can not sustain the excitation of mri in the unstable zone .",
    "indeed , the turbulence weakens extremely at @xmath99 in figure  [ fig : eta-3d]a .",
    "the profiles of pressure or angular velocity in figures  [ fig : eta - puy]a and [ fig : eta - puy]b depict the quasi - steady state set up by the non - uniform mri activity .",
    "most of what we see here is quite similar to the results of the two - dimensional simulations described in paper i even though the initial settings for seed magnetic field and resistivity distribution are totally different .",
    "the rigid rotation causes gas to rotate faster than keplerian velocity in @xmath100 ( figure  [ fig : eta - puy]b ) .",
    "this can change the particle migration drastically . figure  [ fig :",
    "eta-3d]b shows the temporal evolution of the particle density .",
    "the color code is set such that the maximum is ten times the initial value .",
    "after the particles are swept out of the unstable region by the mri flow , they accumulate to the location at @xmath101 ( note that particles leaving the simulation box from the left hand boundary reenter from the right hand boundary after the shearing box correction is taken into account ) .",
    "though not visible in the panels , the particles initially in the stable zone are swept likewise towards the same location .",
    "the accumulation of particles is most clearly shown in figure  [ fig : eta - puy]c in which the radial distribution of the number of particles that is averaged azimuthally and vertically and is normalized by the initial value .    to analyze the particle concentration dynamics in more details , in figure  [ fig : eta - puy]d",
    ", we plot the maximum ( the solid line ) and the minimum ( the dashed line ) values of @xmath85 at a given @xmath4 .",
    "the radial velocities of particles are predicted by equation  ( [ eq : turb ] ) using simulated gas velocity after the establishment of the quasi - steady flow ( @xmath102 ) . since the gas velocity is influenced by remnant turbulence , which has variations dependent on @xmath13 and @xmath5 , the predicted radial velocities have the maximums and the minimums",
    ". figure  [ fig : eta - puy]d shows that the turbulent fluctuations are sufficiently small compared with the systematic angular velocity change due to the modulation of the pressure profile . in figure  [ fig : eta - puy]d , the max / min of radial amplitude of turbulent velocity , @xmath87 , is plotted . the amount of @xmath87 is smaller than those of @xmath85 except in the region @xmath103 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 represents the typical radial velocity of particles that is induced by head / tail angular wind in the absence of turbulence .",
    "also plotted by dots are the actual particle radial velocities in the simulation result , @xmath104 , which are concentrated near the super / sub - keplerian boundary .",
    "the data are taken at @xmath99 , but it stays essentially the same after the mri saturation at @xmath105 . in the radial regions where the maximum @xmath85 is negative , gas rotation is sub - keplerian for all @xmath13 and @xmath5 . in such radial locations ,",
    "all the particles lose their angular momentum by the drag due to the slower angular wind and migrate inward .",
    "conversely , in the regions where the minimum @xmath85 is positive , all the particles migrate outward . in the middle of the stable zone ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "the gas flow is hardly changed .",
    "the value of @xmath106 corresponds to the infall speed due to global pressure gradient under the initial condition .",
    "the particles are concentrated to the zone where both min[@xmath107 < 0 $ ] and max[@xmath107 > 0 $ ] are satisfied , which is situated around @xmath108 .",
    "the zone satisfying the two inequalities is rather narrow in @xmath4 , and the difference between the maximum and the minimum @xmath85 in this zone is small , resulting in high concentration of the dust particles at the outer - edge of the super - keplerian zone as shown in figure  [ fig : eta - puy]c . because @xmath109 in most of the regions except for the dust concentration zone , and the width of the dust concentration zone is small , the effects of turbulence do not significantly expand the dust concentration zone .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eta - clump]a , we plot the time variation of the maximum number of particles per grid .",
    "the more or less monotonic increase leads to the peak density of more than 1,000 times the initial density for @xmath110 .",
    "we will show that the same clump grows in density while keeping its identity , which is needed for subsequent gravitational instability .",
    "we pick up a particular time @xmath111 during the period when the number of dust particles in the densest grid in the whole region increase monotonically or is saturated .",
    "then , we search for the cell which has the largest number of particles in it .",
    "this cell is identified as the center of the most prominent clump that is composed of a number of cells .",
    "the i d numbers of the @xmath112 particles in this cell of the highest density at @xmath113 are recorded and their motions are traced in time ( also backward in time if necessary ) . to determine a new position of the center of the same clump at different times , we inspect the cells within 5 grid distance ( @xmath114 ) from the center of mass of the traced particles .",
    "the cell having the largest number of particles among them is defined to be the new position of the center of the clump .",

    "the time evolution of the number of particles in the cell at the center of the traced clump is plotted by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : eta - clump]a .",
    "it agrees with the maximum number of particles over the whole region , indicating that the same clump keeps its identity and stays to be the most prominent clump .",
    "another way to confirm that the clump steadily holds together is to inspect the velocity dispersion of particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta - clump]b presents the velocity dispersion of particles as a function of distance from the center of the clump at @xmath117 .",
    "all the compositional velocity dispersions are extremely low ( @xmath118 ) , indicating that the particles are not to be diffused significantly .",
    "when the self - gravity is taken into account , the high mass density and the low velocity dispersion should be the preferable condition for the subsequent planetesimal formation via gravitational instability .",
    "when the global pressure gradient is steeper , the effects on dust dynamics described at the final part of section 3 must be considered . for the case shown here , we make discussion by inspecting figure  [ fig : eta - puy]d and equation  ( [ eq : turb ] ) . from the maximum amplitude of min[@xmath85 ]",
    "change ( @xmath120 ) , we can expect that the value of min[@xmath85 ] remains positive ( vertically and azimuthally uniform super - keplerian region survives ) if @xmath121 .",
    "that is , dust particles are prevented from infall as long as @xmath121 .",
    "this condition would be marginally satisfied at @xmath122au in the mmsn model .",
    "though the dust concentration that occurs at @xmath123 would be shifted inward with the more downward shift of the @xmath85 ( larger negative @xmath17 ) , the turbulence effect on dust concentration would not change because the turbulence level @xmath87 is evenly low .",
    "therefore , with a steeper global pressure within the range of @xmath121 , the dust particles would drift faster towards and accumulate more efficiently at the outer - edge of super - keplerian region .      in the models of case2",

    "the gray scale and lines are radial velocity of gas and magnetic field lines , respectively .",

    "it is found that the results of the present three - dimensional run are similar to the corresponding two - dimensional results described in paper i. the instability is excited only inside the unstable region . a part of the stable area is disturbed as well , because the resistivity is not large enough to dissipate the fluctuations immediately ( @xmath128 ) .",

    "the inhomogeneous mri growth creates the near - rigid rotation pattern in the middle ( @xmath131 ) and the modified coriolis force balances with the newly created pressure gradient force .",
    "the small vertical magnetic field together with the flat angular velocity profile suppresses the growth of mri at later times inside the unstable region in which mri was initially excited .",
    "while these results of model - s40 are similar to those of model-@xmath2 ( case1 ) , three differences are pointed out : i ) the pressure and angular velocity are distributed less smoothly in the stable region in figures  [ fig : s40-puy]a and [ fig : s40-puy]b , which is attributed to deeper penetration of the mri activity , ii ) super - keplerian region exists at @xmath132 , in addition to the middle region of @xmath133 , and iii ) the weak instability persists at least until @xmath134 in the stable region near the unstable region ( figure  [ fig : s40 - 3d]a ) .",
    "the super - keplerian region at @xmath132 arises , because larger stable region makes mass and angular momentum transport less efficient around the middle of the stable region ( @xmath135 ) . as a result ,",
    "the pressure gradient becomes positive at @xmath132 . in model-@xmath2 , the large magnetic resistivity in the stable region",
    "suppresses the instability even in the region of steep radial gradient of angular velocity .",
    "but , since in the models of case2 , constant magnetic resistivity is assumed , the magnetic field is not completely dissipated in the stable region with the steep radial gradient .    figure  [ fig : s40 - 3d]b presents the temporal evolution of the particle density .",
    "the evolution of the particle density pattern is similar to case1 .",
    "however , unlike case1 , not all the particles are assembled to the focal annulus .",
    "figure  [ fig : s40-dust]a shows the azimuthally and vertically averaged value of the number of particles as a function of @xmath4 . as expected , particles are condensed at @xmath136 ( the outer - edge of the super - keplerian region ) .",

    "the dots concentrated at @xmath136 in the figure are actual velocities of all the simulated particles .",
    "the actual data of the particle velocities are well reproduced by equation  ( [ eq : turb ] ) , since most of the data points are located between the predicted minimum and maximum values .",

    "figure  [ fig : s40-dust]c presents the radial distribution of the two components .",
    "the maximum and minimum values for each component are plotted .",
    "it is shown that the effect of the remnant turbulence is small and overall features of particle radial migration is represented by @xmath85 . due to the non - smooth pressure and velocity distributions , @xmath138 \\simeq { \\rm min}[v_{\\rm f}]>0 $ ] at @xmath139 and @xmath140 , in addition to @xmath133 .",
    "it means that all particles have positive radial velocity there and accumulate near the outer edges of these regions . on the other hand , @xmath141 \\simeq { \\rm max}[v_{\\rm f}]>0 $ ]",
    "is observed in some areas , for example , around @xmath142 .",
    "a small number of particles are stalled there .",
    "the peaks of particle density at @xmath143 would not grow because there are few particles which can accumulate from outside ( figure  [ fig : s40-dust]a ) .",
    "the stagnant areas can not stall all the particles which migrate inward due to @xmath138<0 $ ] ( figure  [ fig : s40-dust]b ) .",
    "therefore the peak at @xmath136 is the most prominent concentration zone .",
    "figure  [ fig : s40-clump]a shows the time variation of the number of particles in the densest grid in the whole region and at the center of the traced clump .",
    "the agreement between the two indicates that the same clump is growing .",
    "figure  [ fig : s40-clump]b is the velocity dispersion of particles within the clump at @xmath144 .",
    "the velocity dispersion is small but is larger than in model-@xmath2 .",
    "while the turbulence does not affect the location of the dust concentration , it does influence the degree of particle accumulation .",
    "when the azimuthal box size is long , shear velocity becomes supersonic near the edge and it may cause artificial density dip @xcite unless a high - order scheme is applied for keplerian advection term . to confirm that the density dip found in our simulations is not caused by such a numerical error , we also carried out a run in which the unstable region is put in the side areas and the stable region is at the center .",
    "the other parameters are the same as model - s40 .",
    "we found that the density dip is formed at the side area and no artificial density dip is created in the central area , which means that our numerical scheme using cip method with the staggard mesh and the short timestep ( @xmath145 ; courant condition is set to be @xmath146 ) is sufficiently high - order scheme .",
    "let us discuss the effects of a steeper global pressure gradient .",
    "following the same argument as in the final part of section 4.1 , from the value of @xmath85 or @xmath147 , a super - keplerian region would remain unless the global prssure gradient is as anomalously large as @xmath148 . to make a more quantitative argument , as was done in @xcite",
    ", we also carried out a run with the pressure gradient of @xmath92 ( model - s40b ) .",
    "the other parameters are the same as model - s40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : s40b - drift ] shows the close - up of the distribution of @xmath149 $ ] and @xmath150 $ ] . with the higher negative value of @xmath17 , gas rotates more slowly and the stronger headwind deprives the dust particles of angular momentum more efficiently to accelerate their inward migration in the sub - keplerian region . since @xmath87 does not depend on @xmath17 , the value of @xmath151 exceeds @xmath152 by a larger degree in outer regions .",
    "thus greater amounts of dust particles move to the dust concentration area without becoming locally stagnant due to non - smooth gas pressure and gas velocity fluctuations in the sub - keplerian region . on the other hand , in the dust concentrated area ,",
    "the dust particles are affected by turbulence more severely . with more downward shift of the @xmath85 value in the whole region , the dust concentration that occurs at @xmath123",
    "is shifted inward to @xmath153 from @xmath154 .",
    "the magnetic turbulence is stronger at this new location and it increases the radial width ( @xmath155 ) of the dust accumulated region ( denoted by @xmath141>0 $ ] and @xmath138<0 $ ] : the gray hatched areas in the figure from @xmath156 to @xmath157 and doubles the velocity dispersion of particles there . to see the overall consequences of these both positive and negative effects ,",
    "the number of particles in the most dense grid cell is plotted in figure  [ fig : s40-clump]a together with the result of model - s40 . despite the different dust radial velocity and gas turbulence ,",
    "the density increase rate and the peak value are only slightly different from each other , although the new run could show higher dust density on longer timescale .",
    "the effects of turbulence are larger for particles with shorter @xmath158 .",
    "we have run a case with @xmath159 ( model - t01 ) . except for the friction time",
    ", all the settings are the same as model - s40 .",
    "since there is no kick - back from the dust particles to the mhd fluid , mhd results are exactly the same ( figure  [ fig : s40 - 3d]a and figure  [ fig : s40-puy ] ) .",
    "the difference in the dust concentration pattern is caused by the enhanced gas drag .",
    "figure  [ fig : s40 - 3d]c presents the evolution of the particle density .",
    "the difference from the previous case that becomes visible at the later time is that the smaller dust particles are scattered over a broader area .",
    "figure  [ fig : t01-dust]a shows the radial profile of the dust number density averaged azimuthally and vertically . since the mhd flow patterns are exactly the same , the prominent density peaks are located at the same position as in model - s40 . however , the peak values are lower and the radial widths are wider . furthermore , more particles stay outside the peaks and are scattered in the stable region .",
    "these differences are caused by the enhanced turbulent diffusion of dust particle motions through enhanced gas drag .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : t01-dust]c shows that the turbulent scattering @xmath87 dominates over the steady migration @xmath85 in most areas of the simulation box .",
    "figure  [ fig : t01-dust]b shows the estimated radial velocity of particles @xmath137 .",
    "the radial velocity of the simulated particles , @xmath104 , are also shown by dots .",
    "although dust particles are swept out of the unstable region , in most parts of the unstable region , max[@xmath160 > 0 $ ] and min[@xmath160 < 0 $ ] are satisfied , so the dust particles are broadly distributed in the stable region with lower concentration .",
    "nevertheless , identity of the clump with the highest dust concentration is still maintained ( figure  [ fig : t01-clump]a ) .",
    "indeed the velocity dispersion around center of the traced clump shown is not increased significantly ( figure  [ fig : t01-clump]b ) .",
    "we also run a high global pressure gradient model ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "though the inward migration of dust particles becomes faster on average , the maximum density is unchanged because the remnant turbulence that scatters the dust particles in the dust concentrated region is the dominant factor for this @xmath159 case .",
    "recent works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposed that turbulence itself concentrates dust particles in turbulent eddies . in their models ,",
    "lifetime of the eddies has to be longer than the timescale to form dense enough particle clumps for formation of planetesimals . on the other hand",
    ", our model proposes another path to accumulate dust particles that turbulence plays a role in transformation of the nearly keplerian gas flow into the quasi - steady flow with a local rigid rotation region .",
    "because the dust particles accumulate near the outer edge of super - keplerian parts produced by the rigid rotation and the flow pattern is quasi - steady , the timescale problem does not exist in our model .",
    "actually , in the case of model - s40 and model - t01 with @xmath161 , the same clump with the highest density is maintained until the end of simulations ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "however , in our model , as @xmath11 increases to unity , stronger residual turbulence may destroy the clumps , although the clumps are repeatedly created , which may inhibit planetesimal formation . here",
    ", we examine the cases with larger @xmath11 ( but still @xmath73 ) to find the critical value of @xmath11 for persistent clumping .    in model - s055 ,",
    "the width of the stable region @xmath56 is one eighth of model - s40 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath69 compared to 0.096 of model - s40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : s055 - 3d]a shows that the mri turbulence intrudes into the stable region and covers the whole region without being dissipated .",
    "by @xmath163 , the instability is weakened .",
    "although a clear rigid rotation is not formed inside the unstable region ( figure  [ fig : s055-puy]a ) because of the stronger turbulence that remains especially in the stable region , the velocity gradient becomes small inside the unstable region and the super - keplerian zone is formed . as a result ,",
    "the dust particles are swept out of the unstable region and accumulate near the outer stable / unstable boundary ( figure  [ fig : s055 - 3d]b ) .    however , because the unstable region occupies larger fraction of the simulation box , the resultant magnetic field diffused out of the unstable region is larger than in the previous models .",
    "these lead to stronger remnant turbulence .",
    "figure  [ fig : s055-clump]a shows that the number of particles in the densest grid of the whole region does not agree with that at the center of the traced clump .",
    "it means that the clumping is only tentative , although clumps are repeatedly created .",
    "the diffusive nature of the clumps in model - s055 is depicted by the larger velocity dispersion shown in figure  [ fig : s055-clump]b .",
    "thin lines in figure  [ fig : s055-clump]a shows the clump identity test for model - s11 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "it shows that the clumps are not persistent as well .",
    "therefore , we conclude that persistent clumps of dust particles are formed for @xmath164 .    if the global pressure gradient is steeper , the radial velocity of dust particles is faster and its effect may seem to compete better with that of gas turbulent motion .",
    "however , from figure  [ fig : s055-puy]d , the minimum value of @xmath85 becomes negative in the entire regions if @xmath165 and no particles can be accumulated at the boundary of super / sub - keplerian regions .",
    "there is not much parameter space where more dust concentration can be expected .",
    "we have investigated the dust concentration in protoplanetary gas disks that are in the quasi - steady state created by inhomogeneous magnetorotational instability .",
    "we set the inhomogeneous instability with the initial radial non - uniformity of either ionization degree or vertical component of the magnetic field .",
    "the result of our local three - dimensional resistive mhd simulations with lagrangian particles clearly shows that the meter or decimeter sized dust particles are concentrated strongly and steadily in either setting except for the cases with @xmath166 ( where @xmath11 is the averaged magnetic reynolds number averaged over the simulation box ) , which can allow planetesimal formation via gravitational instability .",
    "the mri growth in our model generates the locally confined super - keplerian region and this flow is quasi - stable due to the support of gas pressure gradient which is also formed by the mri . because unperturbed gas flow is sub - keplerian due to global pressure gradient , the particles suffering gas drag are concentrated in the keplerian domain at the outer - edge of the super - keplerian area .",
    "since the flow is in a quasi - steady state , particles are supplied from outer regions by gas drag migration and the particle density increases significantly .",
    "the process of particle concentration and the increasing rate of dust density depend on the particle size , the initial radial widths of unstable / stable regions , and the initial non - uniformity setting as follows :     _ the initial non - uniform setting , magnetic field or resistivity _ : : :    the non - uniform resistivity model produces more stable and clean state    of local rigid rotation than the non - uniform magnetic field model ,    because the high resistivity dissipates the magnetic perturbations    more rapidly in the stable regions . indeed , the velocity dispersion of    particles in clumps is smaller in the non - uniform resistivity model .    in the non - uniform magnetic field cases ,",
    "the magnetic reconnection and    the remnant weak instability create less smooth gas velocity field , so    that particles tend to assemble at multiple radial positions . on the    other hand , in the non - uniform resistivity case ,",
    "all particles are    concentrated at a specific radial position , and the peak values of the    particle density in clumps is higher , although the particle density    also depends on the size of numerical box . _",
    "the dust size , meter or decimeter _ : : :    the meter - size particles are less coupled with gas motion than    decimeter - size ones . since their radial migration is faster , the    meter - sized particles are more likely to be condensed in the radially    narrow area without being scattered by the remnant gas turbulence . the    peak dust density becomes @xmath167 times larger than the    initial value . even in the decimeter - size particle cases ,",
    "the velocity    dispersion of particles in the clump excited by the remnant turbulence    is sufficiently smaller than radial drift velocity due to the    quasi - steady gas flow and dust concentration is still observed in the    simulations , although the enhanced dust density is at most    @xmath168 . _ the degree of remnant turbulence _ : : :    when the stable region is initially smaller in the non - uniform    magnetic field model ( case2 ) , that is , @xmath11 is    larger , stronger turbulence tends to remain . for    @xmath169",
    ", however , the super - keplerian area    continues to exist and clumps with density @xmath168    times larger than initial values are robustly created .",
    "furthermore ,    for @xmath164 , the clumps are persistent    enough for following gravitational instability , while they are    tentative and repeatedly produced in the cases of    @xmath170 .      _ consistent magnetic resistivity _ : : :    we need to calculate the value of magnetic resistivity consistently as    a time dependent value , because it is sensitive to both gas and dust    densities . around strong dust concentration areas ,",
    "gas and dust    density become larger and magnetic resistivity becomes higher , which    may calm down the remnant turbulence .",

    "the turbulence there may affect    the small dust dynamics near the midplane .",
    "_ feedback from dust particles onto gas _ : : :    the feedback may be the most important .",
    "a great concentration in our    results here will inevitably change gas velocity field and it could    affect the condition of dust concentration ( density enhancement ,    velocity dispersion and so on ) and planetesimal formation .",
    "we have    already started simulations with this effect .",
    "_ collisional destruction _ : : :    while the velocity dispersions of dust particles in clumps are    extremely low in some of our results , the dust particles can be    collisionally disrupted into small fragments that are coupled to gas    motion and the fragments may be dispersed by even weak turbulence . for    clumps",
    "to gravitationally collapse , its timescale needs to be smaller    than mean collision time . on the other hand , if the dust grains are    also produced by the collisions , they might affect the gas ionization    state through recombination of electrons onto their surface .",

    "<S> how to create planetesimals from tiny dust particles in a proto - planetary disk before the dust particles spiral to the central star is one of the most challenging problems in the theory of planetary system formation . in our previous paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that a steady angular velocity profile that consists of both super and sub - keplerian regions is created in the disk through non - uniform excitation of magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) . </S>",
    "<S> such non - uniform mri excitation is reasonably expected in a part of disks with relatively low ionization degree . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show through three - dimensional resistive mhd simulations with test particles that this radial structure of the angular velocity indeed leads to prevention of spiral - in of dust particles and furthermore to their accumulation at the boundary of super - keplerian and sub - keplerian regions . treating dust particles as test particles , </S>",
    "<S> their motions under the influence of the non - uniform mri through gas drag are simulated . in the most favorable cases ( meter - size dust particles in the disk region with a relatively large fraction of mri - stable region ) , we found that the dust concentration is peaked around the super / sub - keplerian flow boundary and the peak dust density is 10,000 times as high as the initial value . </S>",
    "<S> the peak density is high enough for the subsequent gravitational instability to set in , suggesting a possible route to planetesimal formation via non - uniformly excited mri in weakly ionized regions of a disk . </S>"
