    "frequent measurements modify the dynamics of a quantum system .",
    "this result of quantum measurement theory is known as the quantum zeno effect(qze)@xcite and has attracted much attention since first discussed .",
    "the qze is related to the suppression of induced transitions in interacting systems or the reduction of the decay rate in unstable systems .",
    "it has been also pointed out that the opposite effect , i.e the acceleration of the decay process , maybe caused by frequent measurement too and this effect is known as anti - zeno effect(aze ) .",
    "the experimental observation of qze in the early days was restricted to oscillating quantum systems @xcite but recently , both qze and aze were successfully observed in irreversible decaying processes.@xcite .    the quantum theory of measurement predicts a reduction in the decay rate of an unstable system if the time between successive measurements is smaller than the zeno time which in general is smaller than the correlation time of the bath .",
    "the effect is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the measured observable whenever the time between measurements is very small .",
    "this observation does not preclude the manifestation of the zeno effect for larger times ( for example in the exponentially decaying regime ) for well selected observables in a particular bath .",
    "recently it was shown in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) that reduction of the decay rate occurs in an exponentially decaying two level system when interacting with a squeezed bath . in this case",
    "variations on the squeezing phase of the bath may lead to the appearance of either zeno or anti - zeno effect when continuously monitoring the associated fictitious spin . in this work",
    "we show that for the same system it is possible to select a couple observables whose measurement for adequately prepared systems lead to the total suppression of the transitions i.e total zeno effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ sec2 ] ) we discuss some general facts and review some results obtained in reference @xcite which are needed for our discussion . in section ( [ sec3 ] )",
    "we define the system we deal with and identify the observables and the corresponding initial states which are shown to display total zeno effect . in section ( [ sec4 ] )",
    "we show that the initial states which show total zeno effect are intelligent spin states , i.e states that saturate the heisenberg uncertainty relation between the ( fictitious ) spin operators .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in section ( [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "consider a closed system with hamiltonian @xmath0 and an observable @xmath1 with discrete spectrum .",
    "if the system is initialized in an eigenstate @xmath2 measurements , that is the probability that in all measurements one gets the same result @xmath3 , is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the time between consecutive measurements . in the limit of continuous monitoring ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 and",
    "the system is freezed in the initial state .    for an unstable system and",
    "considering evolution times larger than the correlation time of the reservoir with which it interacts , the irreversible evolution is well described in terms of the liouville operator @xmath10 by the master equation @xmath11 if measurements are done frequently , the master equation ( [ master ] ) is modified .",
    "the survival probability is time dependent and is shown to be given by @xcite @xmath12 this expression is valid only when the time between consecutive measurements is small enough but greater than the correlation time of the bath . for mathematical simplicity in what follows",
    "we consider the zero correlation time limit for the bath and then one is allowed to take the limit of continuous monitoring . from equation ( [ ec13 ] )",
    "one observe that the total zeno effect is possible when @xmath13 then , for times larger than the correlation time , the possibility of having total zeno effect depends on the dynamics of the system ( determined by the interaction with the baths ) , on the particular observable to be measured and on the initial state .",
    "the concept of zero correlation time of the bath @xmath14 is of course an idealization .",
    "if this time is not zero , the equation ( [ ec13 ] ) is only approximate , since @xmath6 can not be strictly zero and at the same time be larger than @xmath14 .",
    "also , if equation ( [ ec1239 ] ) is satisfied , then equation ( [ ec13 ] ) must be corrected , taking the next non - zero contribution in the expansion of @xmath15    in that case , a decay rate proportional to @xmath6 appears , and the decay time is @xmath16 , which is in general a number much larger than the typical evolution time of the system .",
    "notice that as the spectrum of the squeezed bath gets broader , @xmath14 becomes smaller , and one is able to choose a smaller @xmath6 , approaching in this way , the ideal situation and the total zeno effect .",
    "in the interaction picture the liouville operator for a two level system in a broadband squeezed vacuum has the following structure @xcite ,    @xmath17    whereh @xmath18 is the vacuum decay constant and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the parameters of the squeezed bath . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the two ladder operators ,    @xmath23    with @xmath24,@xmath25 and @xmath26 the pauli matrices .",
    "let us introduce the bloch representation of the two level density matrix @xmath27 in this representation the master equation takes the form :    @xmath28    and has the following solutions for bloch vector components that give the behavior of the system without measurements @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 now consider the hermitian operator @xmath32 associated to the fictitious spin component in the direction of the unitary vector @xmath33 defined by the angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 the eigenstates of @xmath32 are , @xmath37 @xmath38    if the system is initialized in the state @xmath39 the survival probability at time @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 in this case the function @xmath43 has the structure @xmath44 where now @xmath45 is a function of the angles ..    in figure ( [ etiqueta1 ] ) we show @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 as function of @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "the maxima correspond to @xmath49 . for arbitrary values of @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "there are two maxima corresponding to the following angles :    @xmath52    and @xmath53    these preferential directions given by the vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) define the operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 which show total zeno effect if the initial state of the system is the eigenstate @xmath58 or respectively @xmath59 .    to be specific let us consider measurements of the observable @xmath60 ( analogous results are obtained for @xmath61 ) .",
    "the modified master equation with measurements of @xmath62 is given by @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is given by ( [ em1 ] ) .",
    "besides of the total zeno effect obtained in the cases specified above it is also very interesting to discuss the effect of measurements for other choices of the initial state .",
    "this can be done numerically . in figure ( [ etiqueta2 ] )",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath66 , that is the mean value of observable @xmath67 , when the system is initialized in the state @xmath68 without measurements ( master equation ( [ em1 ] ) ) and with frequent monitoring of @xmath69 ( master equation ( [ ecmcm ] ) ) .",
    "consistently with our discussion of frequent measurements , the system is freezed in the state @xmath70 ( total zeno effect ) .    in figure ( [ etiqueta3 ] )",
    "we show the time evolution of @xmath71 when the initial state is @xmath72 without measurements and with measurements of the same observable as in previous case .",
    "one observes that with measurements the system evolves from @xmath73 which is the stationary state of eq .",
    "( [ ecmcm ] ) whenever we do measurements in @xmath67 .",
    "analogous effects are observed if one measures @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , for measurements in other directions different from those defined by @xmath75 or @xmath76 , the system evolves to states which are not eigenstates of the measured observables .",
    "aragone et al @xcite considered well defined angular momentum states that satisfy the equality @xmath77 in the uncertainty relation .",
    "they are called intelligent states in the literature .",
    "the difference with the coherent or squeezed states , associated to harmonic oscillators , is that these intelligent states are not minimum uncertainty states ( mus ) , since the uncertainty is a function of the state itself .    in this section",
    "we show that the states @xmath68 and @xmath78 ) can be written in an explicit lindblad form @xmath79 using only one lindblad operator @xmath80 , @xmath81 obviously the eigenstates of @xmath80 satisfy the condition ( [ ec1239 ] ) .",
    "moreover the states @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the two eigenstates of @xmath80 with eigenvalues @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 consider now the standard fictitious angular momentum operators for the two level system are @xmath86 and also two rotated operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 which are consistent with the electromagnetic bath fluctuations in phase space ( see fig . 2 in ref @xcite ) and which satisfy the same heisenberg uncertainty relation that @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "they are , @xmath91 @xmath92 these two operators are associated respectively with the major and minor axes of the ellipse which represents the fluctuations of bath . using eqs .",
    "( [ ec1222 ] ) and ( [ ec1223 ] ) one can show that the mean values of these operators have the following exponentially decaying evolution : @xmath93    @xmath94    notice that the above averages decay with maximum and minimum rates respectively .    in terms of @xmath87 y @xmath88 we have @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath80",
    "has the form @xmath97 with @xmath98    following rashid _",
    "_ et al ( _ _ @xcite _ ) _ we define a non hermitian operator @xmath99 @xmath100 so that @xmath101 after some algebra one obtains then that @xmath102    the eigenstates of @xmath80 are then eigenstates of @xmath99 with eigenvalues @xmath103 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath99 are are also shown to be intelligent states _",
    "i.e _ they satisfy the equality condition in the heisenberg uncertainty relation for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath104    the operator @xmath99 is obtained from @xmath87 by the following transformation @xmath105 with @xmath106 in terms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath107 , @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath80 takes the form , @xmath110 finally @xmath80 may be written in the form : @xmath111 with @xmath112 then the eigenstates of @xmath80 could be obtained from the eigenstates of @xmath113 using @xmath114 as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a normalization constant .",
    "it is quite clear that @xmath117 are intelligent states of the observables @xmath118which are rotated versions of @xmath119 .",
    "they are also quasi - intelligent states of the original observables @xmath119@xcite ) .",
    "one can verify the above result , by finding directly the eigenstates of @xmath80 : @xmath120    finally , when the system is initialized in one of these states , the mean value of @xmath87 is zero , @xmath121 .",
    "then , the term with the biggest decaying rate does not appear in the mean value of the measured observable @xmath122 which becomes : @xmath123 using the definition of the angle @xmath124 one can prove that @xmath125 which is a neccesary condition in order to obtain total zeno effect when one is measuring the observable @xmath122(see fig ( [ etiqueta2 ] ) ) .",
    "we have shown that total zeno effect is obtained for two particular observables @xmath56 or @xmath126 , for which the azimuthal phases in the fictitious spin representation depend on the phase of the squeezing parameter of the bath and the polar phases depend on the squeeze amplitude @xmath127 . in this sense , the parameters of the squeezed bath specify some definite atomic directions .",
    "when performing frequent measurements on @xmath67 , starting from the initial state @xmath68 , the system freezes at the initial state as opposed to the usual decay when no measurements are done . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath128 the frequent measurements on @xmath67 will makes it evolve from the state @xmath72 to @xmath68 .",
    "more generally , when performing the measurements on @xmath67 , any initial state evolves to the same state @xmath68 which is the steady state of the master equation ( [ ecmcm ] ) in this situation .",
    "the above discussion could appear at a first sight surprising .",
    "however , taking a more familiar case of a two - level atom in contact with a thermal bath at zero temperature , if one starts from any initial state , the atom will necessarily decay to the ground state .",
    "this is because the time evolution of @xmath129 is the same with or without measurements of @xmath26 . in both cases the system goes to the ground state , which is an eigenstate of the measured observable @xmath26 . in the limit @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and the state @xmath132 @xmath133 , which agrees with the known results .",
    "finally , we also found that the eigenstates of @xmath80 are also quasi - intelligent states of the observables @xmath119 _ i.e _ intelligent states of the rotated version of the observables , that is , of @xmath134 .",
    "starting from an eigenstate of @xmath26 , these intelligent states are obtained by applying the transformation defined by @xmath114 ."
