    "surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) is a well accepted direct detection technique for monitoring biological processes @xcite . while ellipsometry is another well known method for analyzing thin film properties @xcite , its use in liquid medium for monitoring biochemical reactions",
    "is made difficult by the varying environment through which the probing light beam has to propagate . in the kretschmann configuration , the laser generating the spr evanescent wave is only propagating through the substrate , leading to a better control over the influence of the various buffer solutions used during a protein adsorption experiment .",
    "the use of various acoustic wave devices for monitoring bound mass changes in liquid media is well known @xcite .",
    "love mode devices , based on the propagation of a guided shear acoustic wave , present sensitivity improvements over the more usual quartz crystal microbalance @xcite as well as a compatibility with measurements in liquids .",
    "we take advantage of the unique geometrical setup of the surface acoustic wave ( saw ) device which leaves the backside of the quartz wafer free of electrodes to inject a laser in order to generate an evanescent surface plasmon on the gold coated sensing area .",
    "such a setup enables simultaneous estimates of the bound mass and dielectric surface properties changes during electrochemical and biochemical reactions occurring on the sensing electrode @xcite .",
    "estimates of water content in protein layers is an important topic in the development of biosensors , since the detection sensitivity is directly related to the number of active sites on the surface of the sensor to which the receptor molecules are bound .",
    "when physical measurements of this bound layer are performed , such as via spr or acoustic measurements , a large water content will lead to overestimates of the potential detection limit of the biosensor due to an overestimate of number of molecules bound to the surface . from a more fundamental point of view , determining water level content should provide more accurate physical parameters of the protein layer itself such as density and optical index by allowing the subtraction of the influence of water once it has been identified .",
    "we use a modified commercial spr instrument ( ibis ii , ibis technologies bv , the netherlands ) to detect the surface plasmon resonance angle after replacing the gold coated glass slide by a love mode saw device ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the excitation laser in this instrument has a wavelength of 670  nm . all reflected intensity _ vs. _ angle curves ( 6  @xmath3 angle span recorded on a 200  pixels ccd array )",
    "were recorded and later fitted by a polynomial to extract with high accuracy the position of the dip .",
    "the acoustic wave device is made of a 500  @xmath4 m thick st - cut quartz wafer on which 200  nm thick sputtered @xmath5 interdigitated electrodes are patterned .",
    "the surface is coated by a 1.13  @xmath4 m pecvd silicon dioxide layer acting as a guiding layer , and the 4.9@xmath65.4  mm@xmath7 sensing area is coated with 10  nm @xmath8 and 50  nm @xmath9 .",
    "this area acts both as a working electrode for electrochemistry or a grounded electrode during biochemical experiments , as well as a supporting layer for the surface plasmon resonance generation .",
    "the influence of the saw device substrate over the detection of the spr is limited to interference patterns due to the birefringence of the quartz , and the optical index mismatch between the quartz and the deposited silicon dioxide layer .",
    "the former effect is reduced by orienting the optical axis of quartz so that it is in the plane defined by the normal to the sensing surface and the wavevector of the laser , thus minimizing the optical index difference between the ordinary and the extraordinary axis .",
    "the remaining interference patterns lead to fringes with a low enough contrast that the surface plasmon peak is easily identified and tracked during the experiments .",
    "the phase of the saw delay line is monitored at a fixed frequency using a network analyzer hp4396a at 123.200  mhz .",
    "the phase shift is converted to a frequency shift thanks to the linear phase to frequency relationship recorded in the bode plot .",
    "the observed phase shift leads to a frequency shift ( as would be observed in a phase locked loop configuration ) which in turn can be converted to an adsorbed mass change through the sensitivity of the device .",
    "we first electrodeposited copper on the surface in order to calibrate the mass sensitivity of the acoustic wave device in liquid medium ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the spr displayed resonance angle shifts due to the varying potential @xcite .",
    "when the voltage applied by the potentiostat is above 0.2  v with respect to the @xmath10 pseudo reference electrode , the spr angle slightly shifts due to the electroreflectance effect described by ktz _",
    "_ @xcite . below 0.2",
    "v , under potential deposition starts depositing a mono layer of @xmath10 atoms on the @xmath9 surface as visible both in the phase shift of the saw device and as a reversal of the trend of the angle shift of the spr .",
    "below 0  v , a rough @xmath10 layer is deposited , leading to a loss of the spr peak and a large phase shift of the saw device due to the large added mass .",
    "the rough , discontinuous film of copper clusters a few tens to hundreds of nanometers high was observed by in - situ afm imaging ( data not shown @xcite ) .",
    "simulating the influence of sub - wavelength metallic structures on the surface plasmon resonance is a difficult task @xcite which we have not attempted to solve .",
    "simultaneously , the saw device displays a frequency drop @xmath11 due to the added mass @xmath12 to the sensing electrode , leading with the combination of the current measurement from the potentiostat to a direct estimate of the mass sensitivity @xmath13 where @xmath14  cm@xmath7 is the area of the sensing working electrode and @xmath16  mhz the base frequency of the saw device .",
    "the electrodeposited mass is deduced from the current measurement @xmath17 with a sampling period @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20  c is the faraday constant , @xmath21 the molar weight of the electrodeposited metal and @xmath22 the number of electrons exchanged for each metallic atom reduced .",
    "the resulting sensitivity for the love mode device under consideration here is 150@xmath215  cm@xmath7/g .",
    "once the mass sensitivity of the saw is calibrated , we adsorbed on the same device a crystalline monolayer of s - layer proteins ( 100  @xmath4g / ml of the protein sbpa of _ bacillus sphaericus _ ccm 2177 in 0.5  mm tris , 10  mm @xmath23 , ph=9 buffer ) @xcite while monitoring simultaneously with the saw device the mass variation and with spr the surface dielectric change .",
    "the adsorption and desorption steps , the latter being possible with the use of 2  % @xmath24 , was repeated several times ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a property of this protein which makes it suitable for calibration of a new instrument is that it only forms a monolayer and will not stack to multiple layers even at high concentrations .",
    "the parameters required for analyzing the saw data are the layer thickness @xmath25 and the layer density @xmath26 . the parameters required for analyzing the spr data are the common layer thickness @xmath25 and the optical index @xmath27 of the adsorbed layer .",
    "we thus have three free parameters and only two measurements , namely the adsorbed mass per unit area and an spr resonance angle shift which is a function of both @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "the two options are to add one more measurement parameter , such as an spr dip position as a function of wavelength which would lead to a unique identification of @xmath25 and @xmath27 @xcite , or to reduce the number of variables by adding the assumption that the layer is made of a homogeneous mixture of a proportion @xmath28 of protein and @xmath29 of water .",
    "the layer density @xmath26 is then @xmath30 where @xmath31 is assumed to be equal in the @xmath32  g/@xmath33 to 1.4  g/@xmath33 range @xcite and @xmath34  g/@xmath33 is the density of water .",
    "similarly , we use then the optical index of the layer @xmath35 with the optical index of the protein layer assumed to be in the @xmath36 to @xmath37 range @xcite and that of water @xmath38 .",
    "the remaining unknown parameters are then the layer thickness @xmath25 and the water content proportion @xmath29 . by simulating a stack of planar multilayers ( glass @xmath39 , 1200  nm silicon dioxide @xmath40 , 2  nm titanium @xmath41 @xcite , 50  nm gold @xmath42 @xcite , proteins , water ) for the angle shift as a function of water content and layer thickness",
    ", one obtains a set of pairs of values for these two parameters compatible with the observed angle shift ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , bottom ) .",
    "then , by calculating the mass per unit area @xmath43 , a comparison with the experimentally observed adsorbed mass as seen from the phase shift of the saw device leads to a unique set of parameters both compatible with the optical index change and the adsorbed mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , top ) . in the case under consideration here , an observed angle shift of 380 to 400  m@xmath3 and an adsorbed mass of 540 to 580  ng / cm@xmath7 is only compatible with @xmath44 and @xmath45  nm . the thickness result is compatible with atomic force microscope ( afm ) measurements in liquid @xcite while the mass per unit area is compatible with morphological data obtained by electronic microscopy @xcite . while the main source of uncertainty is due to the wide possible values of the density and optical index reported in the literature , the experimental results display good reproducibility .",
    "the water content is lower than that observed by other authors for different kinds of proteins @xcite but compatible with the 30 to 78% value cited in ref .",
    "the dense packing of protein is explained by the regular arrangement of identical s - layer subunits in the p4 lattice @xcite .",
    "we have shown here how the combination of love mode saw device with spr provides advantageous combinations of information on the bound mass as well as on the dielectric changes when monitoring protein adsorption . the resulting protein layer thickness and protein content percentage , respectively @xmath45  nm and @xmath46  % , is in agreement with independent afm estimates .",
    "the saw transducers were fabricated within the framework of a belgian phd scholarship program ( fonds pour la formation  la recherche dans lindustrie et dans lagriculture  fria ) .",
