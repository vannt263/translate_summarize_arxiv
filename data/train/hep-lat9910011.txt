    "the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) approach has been applied to investigate the qcd dynamics under the renormalization transformation and to develop improved lattice actions which enable us to carry out simulations close to the continuum limit even on rather course lattices . in the multi - dimensional coupling space ,",
    "an action @xmath0 is transformed from one point to another point under the blocking transformation .",
    "there is a special trajectory ( renormalised trajectory : rt ) which starts from the ultra - violet fixed point and on which actions keep long range contents corresponding to continuum physics .",
    "recently hasenfratz and niedermayer reminded us of this fact and called the action on the rt a `` perfect action '' @xcite .",
    "this report summarises our previous mcrg study of qcd in two - dimensional coupling space and proposes a model equation to describe the observed flow features .",
    "the action takes the form @xmath1 where `` plaq '' and `` rect '' mean @xmath2 and @xmath3 loops respectively .",
    "we apply the swendsen s blocking transformation @xcite and determine the couplings of resultant action @xmath4 by the schwinger - dyson equation method @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] the coupling flow under a factor 2 blocking transformation is expressed as arrows @xcite .",
    "the observed attractive flow to a narrow stream indicates that the rt lies near the present coupling space .",
    "this fact was shown more manifestly by performing simulations in the three - dimensional coupling space which contains the 3d twist operator in addition to the plaquette and rectangular loops @xcite : starting from the plane @xmath5 , the departure from this plane is small and flow features are almost the same as the ones obtained in two coupling space .",
    "it is hence expected that actions lying on the rt of the 2d coupling space actually reduce the finite lattice spacing effects . to examine this",
    ", we defined the dbw2 action ( doubly blocked wilson action in 2d coupling space ) through the line defined by the points obtained with successive twice blocking from the wilson action @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] , dbw2 is represented by a dotted line as well as iwasaki and symanzik actions @xcite .",
    "we analysed the rotational symmetry restoration effect and the scaling of @xmath6 with the coupling , and found that dbw2 actually improves these quantities .",
    "we try to describe the observed flow in terms of a model equation which contains a marginal and a irrelevant coupling .",
    "let us start in the weak coupling region .",
    "we adopt the following equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . due to asymptotic",
    "scaling , the constant @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 has eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( irrelevant ) with eigenvectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "@xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is a constant vector orthogonal to @xmath15 .    in eq.([eq :",
    "weakrg ] ) , the two - loop asymptotic scaling holds for @xmath20 as @xmath21    to obtain the model equation in the strong coupling region , let us consider the strong coupling calculation of wilson loops in two coupling space . @xmath22 where @xmath23 are tiling weights for filling the area by @xmath24 [ @xmath3 ] and @xmath26 [ @xmath2 ] tiles . imposing the area law with physical string tension @xmath28",
    ", the @xmath29 wilson loop is expressed as @xmath30 for @xmath31 , these equations require @xmath32 in the leading order of @xmath33 . then for finite @xmath34 , @xmath35 follows to the same order .",
    "thus the model equation in the strong coupling region is as follows .",
    "@xmath36 where we include the next order contributions with parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    combining equations ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) ,",
    "we come to the following rg equation in terms of a dimensionless variable @xmath39 : @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "the two vectors @xmath15 and @xmath14 are parameterised as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then the matrix @xmath11 with a zero and a finite eigenvalue @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a vector orthogonal to @xmath14 .",
    "the vector @xmath19 is given by @xmath47 .",
    "we fit the results of @xcite to this rg equation .",
    "preliminary results of the fit are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : model1 ] and [ fig : model2 ] . to show the qualitative features ,",
    "we use @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . these parameter values are not the result of well - tuned fit .",
    "figure [ fig : model1 ] shows @xmath53 vs @xmath54 .",
    "filled symbols are fitted data while open symbols are results of the fit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] , the flow described by the model equation is displayed .",
    "these results indicate that the qualitative features of the flow are well described .",
    "in this proceedings , we summarise our previous works on the mcrg analysis in two dimensional coupling space and propose a model equation which , although sufficiently simple to handle , describes well the features of the observed rg flow . a more quantitative analysis will obtain the renormalization trajectory in two - coupling space on which the action is expected to contain quite small finite lattice spacing effects .",
