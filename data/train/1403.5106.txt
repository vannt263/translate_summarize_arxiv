    "the origin of the pseudogap ( pg ) @xcite behavior of the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) remains an open issue even though more than quarter a century has passed after the discovery of superconductivity in these materials @xcite .",
    "the pg phase turned out to be more challenging and subtle than the superconducting phase itself .",
    "indeed , the pg has been measured as a depression in the density of states at the fermi energy below the doping dependent pg temperature @xmath3 , but no broken symmetry has so far been observed beyond any doubt @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed in order to explain this pg phenomenon , with some based on the preformed - pairs scenario and others based on competing orders @xcite . the rotating antiferromagnetism theory ( raft ) , which belongs in the latter ,",
    "is characterized by two competing orders ; namely the d - wave superconductivity and the rotating antiferromagnetic ( raf ) order .",
    "the raf order parameter has a finite magnitude below a temperature , which was identified with @xmath3 , and a phase that varies with time @xcite .",
    "raft yield results in good agreement with several experimental data of the htscs .",
    "resistivity @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , raman @xcite , and arpes @xcite have been analyzed within raft assuming the phenomenological marginal - fermi liquid ( mfl ) self - energy @xcite . until before the completion of this work , the justification for using this assumption was missing . the results of this work show that going beyond the mean - field solution of raft a self energy that is consistent with a mfl is derived . more importantly , in the limit of the tight - binding bare electrons our self - energy satisfies the same equation as in the second - order born approximation , which was used in the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , we generalize this approximation into a gapped second - order born approximation that takes into consideration the pg .",
    "interestingly , we can qualify the raf state as a state that is nearly antiferromagnetic because the raf state has the same ( free ) energy as a true ordered antiferromagnetic state but is a disordered state because of the time dependence of the phase of the raf order parameter .",
    "below the pg temperature in the underdoped regime , we find that the relaxation rate displays a linear behavior at large frequencies consistent with a marginal fermi liquid , but it displays strong deviation from linearity at low frequencies , which is characterized by a hump due to the pg . in the overdoped regime at any temperature or above the pg temperature in the underdoped regime , the relaxation rate shows a mixture of fermi liquid ( fl ) and mfl behaviors .",
    "we argue that this evolution with doping is related to the fermi surface ( fs ) reconstruction @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we calculate the gaussian corrections to the mean - field solution of raft using a hubbard - stratanovich identity that decouples the quartic term of the hubbard model in the channel of raf order .",

    "first of all , it is clear from this figure and figure [ fig3 ] that @xmath126 shows a strong @xmath1 dependence . for example , for @xmath123 in the underdoped regime , there is a factor of @xmath128 roughly between @xmath126 for the fs point away from the diagonal ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and the fs point on the diagonal ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . for this doping ( @xmath123 ) , the mfl linear behavior at high frequencies is followed by a deviation from linearity as the frequency decreases , then by a hump due to the pg at even lower frequencies . for @xmath134 near the optimal point , @xmath126 decreases linearly with frequency , then saturates for @xmath136 and presents a hump due to the pg at even lower frequency .",
    "these trends are the same as those encountered for the fs point on the diagonal of the brillouin zone in fig .",
    "for the doping @xmath131 above the optimal point ( where the pg is zero ) , @xmath126 can be fitted using linear and quadratic terms ; it thus shows a mixture of fl and mfl behavior like for the fs point on the diagonal .    regarding the comparison with experiment , our results for self - energy are qualitatively consistent with the experimental data of the optical conductivity , which was analyzed using the extended drude model @xcite .",
    "the downward deviation from linearity in @xmath126 versus frequency , observed experimentally , is accounted for in the present theory .",
    "taking @xmath137 ev , which is the value considered in raft s past works , we find that the values of @xmath117 are in the same range as the experimental ones @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath126 is in units of @xmath7 in figures [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] .",
    "there are however discrepancies between the calculated relaxation rate and the experimental one .",
    "these differences can be attributed mainly to the following reasons : the extended drude analysis used the drude conductivity with a mass enhancement factor and a frequency and temperature dependent relaxation rate .",
    "this analysis does not take into account the pg explicitly , contrary to the present microscopically calculated self - energy , which does include the pg .",
    "also , in raft , the establishment of the pg below @xmath3 in the underdoped regime causes the reconstruction of the fs .",
    "this important property is not unfortunately taken into account in the extended drude analysis .",
    "note that our present approach does not consider the contributions of the real part of self - energy in this comparison with the extended drude analysis .",
    "in order to justify the usage of a mfl - like self - energy in past works based on raft , we calculated the self - energy corrections beyond the mean - field solution of this theory , and found that the doping , temperature and frequency dependences of this self - energy agree qualitatively well with the results of the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid as far as this mfl behavior is concerned . also , the trends of the imaginary part of this self - energy capture well the main features of the relaxation rate derived in the extended drude analysis of the optical conductivity . note that , contrary to that analysis , the expression of self energy in the present work depends explicitly on the pseudogap .",
    "the main consequences of the latter are a deviation from linearity and a hump in the low frequency regime in the frequency dependence of the relaxation rate @xmath117 . according to the present results ,",
    "the changes in the frequency dependence of self - energy as doping goes from the overdoped regime to the underdoped regime are due to the reconstruction of the fermi surface near optimal doping .",
