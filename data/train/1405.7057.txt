    "@xcite have reported the detection of eight transitions of a closed - shell , linear molecule in observations toward the horsehead photodissociation region ( pdr ) .",
    "they performed a spectroscopic analysis and fit to these transitions frequencies and , based on comparison with the theoretical work ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , attribute these transitions to the @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 cation .",
    "later , @xcite identified the @xmath7 and @xmath8 transitions predicted by @xcite in absorption toward the sgr b2(n ) molecular cloud , as well as tenuous evidence toward sgr b2(oh ) and tmc-1 .",
    "the attribution of these signals to the @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 cation was later disputed by @xcite and @xcite , with the latter suggesting the anion , c@xmath1h@xmath9 , as a more probable carrier based on high - level theoretical work .",
    "@xcite found that the observational evidence at that time supported the assignment of this carrier to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the first laboratory measurements of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 and confirmed the astronomical assignment .",
    "while the question of identity has now been resolved , questions remain surrounding the formation conditions and chemical implications of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 . because @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 has been definitively detected in only two environments - the horsehead pdr and sgr b2(n ) - efforts to explore these questions are hampered by a lack of information . in an attempt to address this deficiency ,",
    "we have conducted a wide search of pdrs and complex molecular sources in search of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 . here , we present the results of a brief , targeted campaign of 14 astronomical sources with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) covering the @xmath10 and @xmath11 transitions of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "we also examine the @xmath10 transition in broadband unbiased line surveys of a further 25 sources .",
    "the observational details are given in ",
    "[ obs ] , resulting spectra are presented and data reduction strategies are outlined in  [ results ] , and a discussion follows in  [ discussion ] .",
    "observations as part of the targeted campaign to detect @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 were conducted over the course of 4 nights in may 2013 , 2 nights in october 2013 , 2 nights in november 2013 , and 2 nights in january 2014 as part of early remote observing trials using the cso .",
    "the dataset of 25 unbiased molecular line surveys was obtained with the cso between september 2007 and june 2013 in the frequency region of the @xmath10 transition .",
    "the cso 230/460 ghz double side band ( dsb ) heterodyne sidecab receiver , operating in its 210 - 290 ghz mode , was used in moderately good weather ( @xmath12 ) resulting in typical system temperatures of @xmath13 k. the backend consisted of two fast fourier transform spectrometers ( ffts ) : ffts1 provided 1 ghz of dsb spectra at 122 khz resolution while ffts2 provided two , 2 ghz dsb spectral windows at 269 khz resolution . for the orion bar observations ,",
    "the receiver was additionally used in its 170 - 210 ghz mode to observe the @xmath14 transition at 202 ghz .",
    "the @xmath15 transition at 180 ghz was not observed due to interference from the nearby water line .",
    "target sources and parameters are given in table [ bamtargetsources ] .",
    "for observations of sources with known extended structure , position switching observations were used . for",
    "more compact sources , a chopping secondary mirror , with a throw of 2@xmath16 was used - this resulted in lower overhead times than position switching observations .",
    "details are given in table [ obssummary ] .",
    "the raw data were intensity calibrated using the standard chopper wheel calibration method , which placed the intensities on the atmosphere - corrected temperature scale , @xmath17 .",
    "all intensities were then set to the main beam temperature scale , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ; the main beam efficiency was taken as @xmath20 = 70% for these observations .",
    "pointing was performed every @xmath52 hours , usually on a planetary source , with pointing corrections converging to within @xmath51 .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "of the 39 sources observed in this work , @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 has been detected in only a single one : the orion bar pdr .",
    "this extends the list of environments in which @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is known to be present to three : the orion bar pdr , the horsehead pdr , and sgr b2(n ) , with tenuous evidence for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 in sgr b2(oh ) and tmc-1 .    the lack of detection of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 , in reasonably high - sensitivity observations , toward any molecularly - rich hot core source outside of sgr b2(n ) is initially puzzling .",
    "the detection in sgr b2(n ) by @xcite may have been fortuitous - the highly sub - thermal nature of the observed absorption features may have allowed their observation despite an otherwise low abundance that would typically preclude detection .",
    "perhaps more puzzling is the lack of detection in the majority of the pdr sources observed here .",
    "the answer is almost certainly one of temperature ; with column densities similar to those found the horsehead and orion bar pdrs , the observations presented here with the cso are not sensitive to material cooler than @xmath5130 k. thus , further high - sensitivity observations at 3 mm , where the boltzmann peak for cold @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 falls , are warranted to fully explore the range of excitation conditions so far attributed to this molecule .",
    "further insight into likely sources in which @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 could be found may also be gained by comparing its formation and destruction pathways to that of hoc@xmath2 .",
    "as described by @xcite , the primary formation mechanism for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is through the reaction of acetylene with c@xmath2 .",
    "destruction readily occurs via reaction with molecular hydrogen ( see eqs . [ c3hpform ] - [ c3hpdest ] ) .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    the detections of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 in the horsehead and orion bar pdrs support these formation and destruction mechanisms .",
    "destruction via h@xmath24 is expected to be rapid and thus dominate @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 populations under typical conditions . within pdr sources ,",
    "however , where the ultraviolet radiation field is greatly enhanced relative to the mean interstellar value , sufficient c@xmath2 may be present to compete with this destruction pathway and lead to detectable abundances of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "a comparison can be made with the chemistry of hoc@xmath2 , which is also formed , directly and indirectly , through reactions of c@xmath2 and destroyed by reaction with h@xmath24 to form hco@xmath2 ( see eqs . [ hocform ] - [ hocdest ] , c.f .",
    "thus , observations of a high hoc@xmath2 abundance ( or alternatively an enhanced [ hoc@xmath2]/[hco@xmath2 ] ratio ) may be indicative of chemical and physical conditions that will also favor the production of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 , and act as a probe to guide future sources .",
    "@xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    indeed , such an enhanced hoc@xmath2 abundance ( and enhanced [ hoc@xmath2]/[hco@xmath2 ] ratio ) has already been detected toward both the orion bar pdr @xcite and the horsehead pdr @xcite , with these values peaking in the region of the pdr .",
    "a similarly enhanced presence of hoc@xmath2 is detected by @xcite in observations of the ngc 7023 pdr , for which @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is not detected in these cso observations .",
    "this suggests that perhaps @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is simply too cold to be detected in our observations at this sensitivity , and that observations at lower frequencies may result in a detection .",
    "observations of hoc@xmath2 in diffuse clouds by @xcite , find abundance ratios of [ hoc@xmath2]/[hco@xmath2 ] comparable to that of the extreme cases of pdr enhancements in the orion bar and ngc 7023 .",
    "this is consistent with the tentative detections of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 absorption in diffuse , spiral arm clouds by @xcite along the line of sight to sgr b2(n ) , and suggests these sources may be intriguing targets for future observations .",
    "finally , detections of hoc@xmath2 toward other regions with enhanced fuv flux provide other tantalizing sources for future study .",
    "a small list of these sources includes , for example , the monocerous r2 ultracompact hii region @xcite and the external galaxies ngc 253 @xcite and m 82 @xcite .",
    "we have examined the results of both a dedicated campaign targeting @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 in 14 sources , as well as 25 additional sources from unbiased molecular line surveys with frequency coverage coincident with @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 transitions .",
    "we detect the presence of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 in only a single source : the orion bar pdr .",
    "these observations are only sensitive to relatively warm material , and follow - up observations at lower frequencies are necessary to obtain a complete picture of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 in these sources .",
    "finally , a comparison to the chemistry of hoc@xmath2 has shown that hoc@xmath2 has the potential to serve as a tracer of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "previous observations of hoc@xmath2 can therefore be used as a guide to efficiently target new sources in additional searches for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
