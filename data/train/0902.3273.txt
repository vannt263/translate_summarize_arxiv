    "( s - cosmos ) survey is comprised of the infrared array camera ( irac , 3.68@xmath0 m ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 m ) data @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the far - infrared ( fir ) 70 and 160  @xmath0 m mips observations of the field .",
    "although the mid - infrared ( mir ) 24  @xmath0 m array is more sensitive to the detection of distant galaxies than the mips - germanium ( mips - ge ) 70 and 160  @xmath0 m detectors , the 24  @xmath0 m data are biased toward warm agn and are affected by broad mid - infrared pah emission and silicate absorption features redshifted into the band .",
    "the strong mir spectral features along with the large variations of the fir / mir continuum ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield highly uncertain bolometric corrections .",
    "the long - wavelength 70 and 160  @xmath0 m observations directly measure the fir peak of the spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) for redshifts @xmath5 and are key for constraining the total infrared luminosities and star - formation rates of galaxies within the cosmos field .",
    "the mips 70 and 160 @xmath0 m data provide an important piece of the puzzle in the quest of understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "the goal of the data paper is to document the data products to facilitate the ongoing research of the cosmos field .",
    "the data products and a description of the observations and data reduction are provided as part of the large public repository of multi - wavelength data for the cosmos field ( _ hubble space telescope _",

    "we present two scientific results here : ( 1 ) the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m source counts , and ( 2 ) the measurement of the confusion noise for the mips 160  @xmath0 m band .",
    "the mips s - cosmos observations were carried out in 4 campaigns from 2006 january through 2008 january ( table 1 ) .",
    "the project ( _ spitzer _ programs 20070 and 30143 ) represents over 450hr of mips observations .",
    "all observations were taken using the scan mapping mode during nominal `` cold '' mips campaigns ( telescope temperatures low enough to yield good quality 160  @xmath0 m data ) .",
    "the initial observations taken in 2006 cycle-2 are described in @xcite .",
    "the cycle-2 observations were comprised of a shallow wide - area ( @xmath6 ) survey to quantify the level of cirrus within the field and a small ( @xmath7 ) deep `` test '' field .",
    "after the successful completion of the cycle-2 program , deep observations over the entire cosmos field were carried out in cycle-3 ( depth of about 2800s , 1350s , and 270s in the mips 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 m bands respectively ) .",
    "the cycle-3 astronomical observational requests ( aors ) were optimized specifically for the mips - ge bands , without compromising the 24 @xmath0 m data .",
    "in contrast , some early mips programs of other groups were designed for the 24  @xmath0 m band at the expense of the mips - ge bands .",
    "the forward and return scan legs were offset by 148@xmath8 which provides sufficient overlap for the 70  @xmath0 m array .",
    "cross - scan dither offsets of @xmath90 , 42 , 83@xmath8 and in - scan dither offsets of @xmath90 , 18@xmath8 were used between multiple maps to account for the unusable parts of the mips - ge arrays and the unobserved central row of the 160  @xmath0 m footprint .",
    "the values of the cross - scan dithers were also chosen to avoid the overlap of 24  @xmath0 m readouts between consecutive maps .",
    "we carried out both forward and reverse scan maps to help characterize the long - term transients of the mips - ge detectors .",
    "the majority of the data were taken in slow scan mode . at the slow scan speed ( @xmath10 ) , each aor consisted of 4 scan legs of 1.5deg .",
    "each aor mapped 1.5deg@xmath11 , and 10 aors were used to map the field once . in total , 13 slow maps ( 29.5hr per map ) were carried out in cycle-3 , along with one map at the medium scan rate ( 12.5hr ) to complete the awarded time .",
    "five aors were lost due to satellite downlink issues in the second epoch of cycle-3 and were re - observed in early 2008 ( cycle-3c , table  1 ) .",
    "the scan direction of mips is determined by the date of observation , and the observations were carried out on the days that minimized the zodiacal light . since the field is near the ecliptic plane , the zodiacal background contributes significantly to the total noise budget for the mips 24 and 70  @xmath0 m bands .",
    "the zodiacal light is not significant at 160  @xmath0 m .",
    "the galactic cirrus level is low in the direction of the cosmos field @xcite and is not the dominant source of confusion noise within the mips - ge bands .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show the final mips 70 and 160  @xmath0 m images , combining all epochs ( table  1 ) . since the 70  @xmath0 m and 160  @xmath0 m arrays are on the opposite side of the mips field of view , the overscan regions yield slightly non - symmetric coverage . for both cycle-3a and cycle-3b , the entire acs field was observed , and the mips over - scan regions provide coverage for the irac data outside of the acs field .",
    "the raw mips - germanium 70 and 160  @xmath0 m ( mips - ge ) data were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) archive and were reduced using the germanium reprocessing tools ( gert , version 20060415 ) and additional specialized scripts developed for processing the mips - ge survey data .",
    "the gert uses an offline version of the ssc pipeline to produce the basic calibrated data products ( bcds ) .",
    "the basic mips - ge processing steps are discussed by @xcite and within the gert documentation .",
    "the processing for s - cosmos made use of lessons learned from the processing of the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the deep goods - north observations @xcite .",
    "additional processing enhancements were derived here using the s - cosmos data .",
    "the main processing steps were carried out in the following order : ( 1 ) calculation of the data ramp slope , ( 2 ) stimulator - flash interpolation , ( 3 ) improved stimulator - flash response solution , ( 4 ) calibration of the slope image to yield the bcd product , ( 5 ) enhanced filtering of the bcd product , ( 6 ) data co - addition , ( 7 ) identification of bright sources , ( 8) masking bright sources and re - calculation of the filtering corrections , ( 9 ) final data co - addition , and ( 10 ) final source extraction . for comparison ,",
    "the on - line ssc pipeline only performs steps ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , basic filtering , and step ( 6 ) , and the gert includes software for steps ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 8) . the 10 processing steps are summarized in the following sub - sections .",
    "the optimal processing for step ( 1 ) depends on the background , the length of the data ramp ( mips - ge data are recorded with non - destructive reads sampled at 0.131  s ) , and the rate of cosmic rays at the time of the observations .",
    "the ssc on - line pipeline is tuned for the short data ramps ( 3s and 4s ) .",
    "we tuned the pipeline modules ( cosmic ray detection and removal and slope estimation ) of step ( 1 ) to minimize the noise level for the longer 10s ramps of the s - cosmos data .",
    "the tuning solutions for 70  @xmath0 m are similar to those derived for the goods - north photometry data which have the same ramp length @xcite .",
    "mips - ge uses stimulator - flash observations to track the response of each detector as a function of time . after the calculation of the initial stimulator - flash solution , which is basically a linear interpolation between stimulator - flash measurements ( step 2 ) , we removed outlier values and re - derived a smoothed stimulator - flash solution ( step 3 ) . for 70  @xmath0 m",
    ", the stimulator - flash response function was smoothed by about 2 minutes ( slightly longer than the stimulator - flash cycle ) to provide the lowest noise . for 160  @xmath0 m ,",
    "the solution was smoothed by about 8 minutes to yield the best results .    in step 4 ,",
    "the bcd data are calibrated as @xmath12/ic$ ] , where @xmath13 is the uncalibrated slope image , @xmath14 is the stimulator - flash response solution derived in step ( 3 ) , and @xmath15 is the dark calibration file .",
    "the @xmath16 calibration file is the illumination correction which corrects for the flat - field response and the non - uniformity of the stimulator flash @xcite .",
    "the flux conversion factor ( @xmath17 ) converts the instrument units into physical surface brightness units of mjysr@xmath18 . for self - consistency",
    ", we adopt the same @xmath15 and @xmath16 files used for the official calibration of the mips instrument @xcite .",
    "the calibration @xmath17 values of 702 mjysr@xmath18 per mips-70-unit @xcite and 41.7 mjysr@xmath18 per mips-160-unit @xcite are adopted .",
    "the calibration of mips is based on stellar seds ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we have placed the data on a constant @xmath20 scale by dividing the data by the color correction factors of 0.918 and 0.959 for the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m bands , respectively @xcite .",
    "these color corrections are appropriate ( accurate to better than 2% ) for a wide range of galaxy and agn seds ( @xmath21 , @xmath223 ) across the filter bandpass .",
    "optimization of the processing steps ( 1 - 4 ) provided sensitivity improvements of about 20% in comparison to the default parameters , while the filtering ( step 5 ) can provide more than a factor of two improvement in point - source sensitivity .",
    "filtering is key in the removal of systematic instrumental effects which impede the ability to integrate down with deep observations .",
    "the two main artifacts impacting mips - ge data are the latents due to the stimulator flashes and variations of the slow response ( @xmath23min ) as a function of time .",
    "the slow response is removed at 70 and 160  @xmath0 m by subtracting a running median per detector as a function of time , i.e. , a high - pass filter .",
    "the latent artifacts due to the stimulator flashes are not fully removed by a simple high - pass filter , since these variations occur on shorter time - scales . at 70 @xmath0",
    "m the stimulator - flash artifacts are correlated by column . since the scan direction is nearly along the columns of the array , these artifacts contribute to the streaking within the maps if not corrected .",
    "we remove the column residuals by subtracting the median of the values along each column for every bcd at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "the combination of the column median filter and a high - pass median time filter per detector removes the instrumental artifacts at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "there is no equivalent column filter at 160  @xmath0 m to remove the high - frequency ( short - time scale ) latent images introduced by the stimulator - flashes .",
    "fortunately at 160  @xmath0 m , these artifacts are repeatable and can be determined by stacking the data as a function of dcenum ( data - collection - event number ) within the stimulator - flash cycle . since the scan - mirror position also varies with dcenum within the stimulator - flash cycle , we stacked the data per aor for each scan - mirror position and took the median value of the stack to derive the correction as a function of detector and scan - mirror position .",
    "these corrections were subtracted from the bcds to remove artifacts due to the stimulator - flashes .",
    "the combination of this stacking correction and a high - pass median time filter removes the instrumental artifacts at 160  @xmath0 m .    with the s - cosmos data",
    ", we tuned the filtering techniques ( step 5 ) to minimize the noise in the output maps .",
    "for both 70 and 160  @xmath0 m , the short - time scale stimulator - flash artifacts were removed first , followed by a high - pass median time filter to remove the longer time - scale transients .",
    "we adopted a time filter width of 12 frames ( 2 minutes ) to yield the best results .",
    "after the initial filtering , the brightest sources have negative `` side - lobes '' in the maps since bright sources bias the calculation of the median for neighboring pixels . to remove these filtering artifacts ,",
    "the filtering was done in two passes .",
    "the data from the first filtering pass ( step 5 ) were co - added ( step 6 ) , and sources were extracted ( step 7 ) to find the location of the bright sources .",
    "the source positions within the original bcds were masked and new filtering corrections were calculated in a second pass , ignoring the pixels containing sources .",
    "this two - pass filtering technique minimizes the artifacts while preserving the point - source calibration .",
    "after the second filtering pass ( step 8) , the data were co - added to produce the final maps ( step 9 , sec .  3.3 ) and sources were extracted to produce the catalogs ( step 10 , sec .",
    "3.4 ) .",
    "the ssc mosaicking software ( mopex , version 16.3.7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to combine the data and make the final images .",
    "a fast plane - to - plane coordinate transformation method was used to project the data onto the sky @xcite with the default mopex interpolation scheme .",
    "we carried out the imaging steps following the techniques discussed for the xfls mips - ge data @xcite .",
    "an important improvement available after the processing of the xfls data is a more robust outlier rejection technique within mopex .",
    "the updated method rejects data around the median of a data stack for each sky pixel instead of rejecting data with respect to the average of the data stack .",
    "this enables more aggressive outlier rejection without compromising the calibration of point sources .",
    "the best sensitivity was obtained using rejection thresholds of @xmath24 .",
    "the new outlier rejection method improved the sensitivity in the maps by about 5% .",
    "the pipeline uncertainties of the bcds and integration times were not used as weights in the co - addition of the data ; all of the data ( 155,411 bcds in total ) flagged as good were given equal weight .",
    "bad data flagged on a detector basis during the pipeline processing or identified as outliers by mopex were not included .",
    "the vast majority of the data were taken with 10s integrations and no correction is needed for the 4s bcds ( all bcds are calibrated correctly in mjys@xmath18 ) .",
    "the pipeline uncertainties ( calculated from the formal error propagation of the pipeline steps ) do not fully represent the actual noise characteristics of the data , and underestimate the real noise slightly in low background regions .",
    "the main utility of the pipeline uncertainties for these data is to provide a lower limit to the input noise for the mopex outlier rejection algorithm .",
    "sources were detected and extracted from the final images using the astronomical point - source extraction ( apex ) tools within the mopex software package and using additional specialized scripts . for optimal source detection and extraction , accurate background subtraction and noise estimates are needed .",
    "the filtering process ( steps 5&8 ) yields a small systematic negative offset of the background level in the image .",
    "this offset was estimated by taking the median of the image within the central regions after masking sources detected at levels greater than @xmath25 .",
    "after the removal of the global offset level ( @xmath26  mjysr@xmath18 at 70 @xmath0 m and @xmath27  mjysr@xmath18 at 160 @xmath0 m ) , there are still local background fluctuations across the image depending on the local density of sources ( both from detected sources and un - detected / confused sources associated with infrared galaxies seen at 24 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the local background level was derived by taking a median within a box around each pixel ( after masking sources detected at levels greater than @xmath25 ) .",
    "for source detection , we used a small box with a linear size of 5 full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) widths to remove the local background , and for source extraction ( fitting ) we used a larger background box with a size of 910 fwhm widths to conserve the calibration .",
    "several types of noise images can be produced by the mopex and apex software , but none are optimal for these data . the `` std '' noise image produced by mopex represents the empirical scatter from the repeated observations per sky pixel divided by the square - root of the number of good observations . for deep observations",
    "the `` std '' file underestimates the true noise since it does not account for the pixel - to - pixel correlated noise or the confusion noise .",
    "apex computes the spatial pixel - to - pixel noise ( `` noise '' file ) by calculating the noise within a local box surrounding each pixel after rejecting positive outliers .",
    "the output `` noise '' image has variations that depend on the outlier parameter and the number of sources within the local box . to avoid local biases due to sources",
    ", we derived a `` noise '' image after the extraction of sources , adopting a box size with a linear scale of 9 - 10 fwhm widths ( the same size used for the local background subtraction for source fitting ) .",
    "to preserve both the small and large scale spatial variations of the uncertainty across the science image , both the `` std '' ( representing small - scale variations ) and `` noise '' ( representing large - scale variations ) files were used .",
    "the quality of `` std '' and `` noise '' images was first improved by smoothing the images by 1 and 3 fwhm widths , respectively , and then combined in quadrature .",
    "equal weights were given to the `` std '' and `` noise '' images at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "since the confusion noise is important at 160  @xmath0 m , the weights at 160  @xmath0 m were based on the relative contributions of the instrument and confusion noise ( sec .",
    "the std image was given a weight corresponding to the instrument noise , and the noise image was given a weight corresponding to the confusion noise to produce the combined uncertainty file at 160  @xmath0 m .",
    "the median level of the combined uncertainty file was scaled to match the total average noise level derived from fitting the @xmath28 width of a gaussian to the data histogram of the image after source extraction .",
    "source extraction and noise estimates were repeated until the results converged .",
    "after proper background subtraction and deriving an accurate uncertainty image , sources were detected using the apex peak algorithm .",
    "peaks with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of greater than 3 were fitted using the point - source response function ( prf , which includes the effects of the detector size and the adopted sub - sampling of the detectors ) image . at the spatial resolution of the mips - ge bands ,",

    "initial source lists were visually analyzed and cleaned to remove sources with low coverage and potential spurious sources in the airy rings around bright sources .",
    "the detection table was updated to remove bad sources , and source fitting was redone . in the few cases where the detection routine failed in the proper de - blending of two or more sources ,",
    "the detection table was modified , and source fitting measurements were redone using better initial source positions .",
    "the absolute pointing reconstruction of the _ spitzer _ telescope is typically better than 1@xmath8 .",
    "the pointing uncertainties are much less than the large fwhm width of the data ( @xmath36 at 70  @xmath0 m and @xmath37 at 160  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "we verified the pointing solutions by comparing the positions of the 70  @xmath0 m sources with their vla radio counterparts @xcite .",
    "for the approximately 400 sources detected at snr@xmath38 at both 1.4  ghz and 70  @xmath0 m , we find an average positional difference ( _ spitzer _ - vla ) of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these small offsets are well within the scatter measured for individual sources of 12@xmath8 , so no positional corrections were made to the data .",
    "mips is calibrated assuming the point - spread functions ( psf , which does not include the effect of the detector size ) calculated using the spitzer tinytim ( s - tinytim ) models ( krist 2002 ) .",
    "the modeled psfs have been shown to match the observations for all bands @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the mips psfs is that significant flux arises outside of the first airy ring on large spatial scales .",
