    "although it has its own long history@xcite , the recent much attention to the brane - world scenarios seems to be mainly due to their new approach to the longstanding gauge - hierarchy problem by introducing large extra dimensions@xcite or warped extra dimensions@xcite . especially randall - sundrum(rs ) scenario may also provide a mechanism for the localization of the gravity on the single positive - tension brane@xcite .",
    "the localization problem of the gravity on the brane is more carefully examined with inclusion of the brane - bending effect @xcite or from the viewpoint of the singular quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "futhermore , the universal aspect of the gravity localization is also discussed @xcite .",
    "in addition to its good feature on hierarchy and gravity localization problem , rs picture supports a non - static cosmological solution @xcite which leads to the conventional friedman equation if one introduces the bulk and brane cosmological constants and imposes a particular fine - tuning condition between them .",
    "recently , the conventional friedman equation is used to provide an additional constraint in finite temperature version of the rs scenario , which naturally generates the nonvanishing and temperature - dependent @xmath1 cosmological constant at effective action level@xcite .",
    "the gravity localization problem naturally leads to a discussion on the gravitational collapse and it makes a debate on the shape of the black hole horizon along the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "the higher - dimensional generalization of rs two brane scenario was considered recently in ref.@xcite . using a ` brane - world sum rule ' discussed in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have shown that the negative - tension brane in original rs @xmath2 picture is not prerequisite at higher - dimensional generalization .",
    "particular attention is paid to the six - dimensional case @xcite . in this case the bulk space - time is reduced to ads soliton @xcite and 3-brane embedded in the six - dimensional bulk exhibits a conical singularity .",
    "the ` brane - world sum rule'@xcite which yielded a motivation to the higher - dimensional extension of rs picture generally provides constraints which the solutions of einstein equation must obey for consistency when the extra dimensions are compact .",
    "thus this rule can not be used when at least one of the extra dimensions is not compactified .",
    "for example , the sum rule in @xmath2 bulk spacetime with flat and compactified extra dimension is @xmath3 = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is warp factor and @xmath5 is an energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "if one applies the sum rule to the rs single brane picture whose line element is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the uncompactified extra dimension ( @xmath9 ) , it is easy to show that the sum rule ( [ 5dsum ] ) does still hold when @xmath10 .",
    "however , rhs of eq.([5dsum ] ) is not zero when @xmath11 , which modifies the sum rule ( [ 5dsum ] ) to @xmath12 = \\frac{24 k}{8 \\pi g_5 } \\delta_{n 0}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is five - dimensional newton constant .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the six - dimensional brane - world which seems to be a generalization of the rs single brane scenario@xcite .",
    "since the extra dimensions are not compact , the solution we will consider here does not obey the ` brane - world sum rule ' . in this case , however , we will show that the fluctuation equation for the linearized gravitational field supports a normalizable zero mode and higher kk states . in this sense",
    "the solution we will present in this paper is physically relevant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will derive a single @xmath0-brane solution of the @xmath14 einstein equation explicitly imposing two fine - tuning conditions .",
    "the warp factor diverges at the asymptotic region of the extra dimension @xmath8 . in section 3",
    "we will consider the linearized gravitational fluctuation .",
    "especially we will concentrate on the transverse traceless modes to examine the gravity within the single brane .",
    "the final equation looks like usual schrdinger - like equation with a position - dependent mass .",
    "it supports a nomalizable zero mode and the higher discrete kk spectrum .",
    "first several kk modes are numerically computed in this section . in section 4",
    "we will show explicitly that the solution obtained in this paper does not obey ` brane - world sum rule ' . a brief conclusion is also given in the same section .",
    "in this section , we will consider a particular solution for the six - dimensional brane - world where the 3-brane is located at the origin .",
    "thus , the appropriate einstein equation we should examine is    @xmath15 \\label{einstein_eq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are bulk cosmological constant and brane tension .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath14 newton constant .",
    "here , @xmath21 is a general radial vector in the curved extra dimensions . in fact",
    ", the einstein equation ( [ einstein_eq ] ) can be derived from einstein - hilbert action @xmath22.\\ ] ] in order to solve eq.([einstein_eq ] ) at six dimension we introduce a radial coordinate @xmath8 and polar angle @xmath23 to describe the extra dimensions .",
    "we will assume that @xmath8 is infinite(@xmath24 ) or semi - infinite ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath23 is bounded as @xmath26 .",
    "now we introduce an ansatz @xmath27 with boundary conditions @xmath28 the first equation in eq.([bc ] ) comes from the anology with original @xmath2 rs picture and the second one is imposed to introduce a conical singularity at the location of @xmath0-brane .",

    "this is because of the exact cancellation of @xmath32-function in the einstein equation although the ricci tensor components @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the curvature scalar @xmath64 have their own @xmath32-functions .    before solving the fluctuation ( [ fluctuation_eq ] )",

    "the potential @xmath77 becomes @xmath78 at @xmath79 and 1/2 at @xmath80 .",
    "thus the global form of the potential looks very similar to the volcano potential in 5d rs case although there is no @xmath32-function potential .",
    "eq.([fluctuation_eq2 ] ) can be interpreted from a different viewpoint as follows : @xmath81 where @xmath82 thus , our linearized gravitational fluctuation equation can be viewed as a usual schrdinger equation with a position - dependent mass .",

    "are examined in ref.@xcite .",
    "especially , the scalar mode indicates the tachyonic instability of the radion@xcite and two - dimensional @xmath32-function appears in the vector mode fluctuation .",
