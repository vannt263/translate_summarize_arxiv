    "more precisely , we show that if alice and bob play a strategy in version i of the qic game that achieves a success probability @xmath65 , the same strategy applied to version ii achieves a success probability @xmath27 that satisfies the relation @xmath138 , for any strategy that they may play , and vice versa .",
    "we change to a more convenient notation , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , in order to make clear that @xmath26 and @xmath135 correspond to pure qubit states with bloch vectors @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "version ii of the qic game is equivalent to the following .",
    "charlie initially prepares the pair of qubits @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the singlet state @xmath8 , he gives alice the qubit @xmath6 and keeps the qubit @xmath7 , for @xmath143 .",

    "<S> thus , quantum information causality shows : _ the maximum possible increase of the quantum mutual information between charlie s and bob s systems is only a function of the dimension of the system @xmath16 received by bob , independently of whether it is alice or charlie who sends bob the system @xmath16 and of how much entanglement bob shares with them_.    if the transmitted system @xmath16 is classical , equality in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m4 ] ) can not be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> information causality states that in this case , @xmath54 , where @xmath40 is a classical system , @xmath5 is a quantum system and @xmath55 denotes their quantum mutual information @xcite . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , this bound is valid even if both systems @xmath40 and @xmath5 are quantum ( see details in the supplemental material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as stated above , quantum information causality follows from three properties of the von neumann entropy : subadditivity , the data - processing and the triangle inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of entropy in mathematical frameworks for general probabilistic theories @xcite and its implication for information causality have been recently investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , it has been shown that a physical condition on the measure of entropy implies subadditivity and the data - processing inequality , and hence that information causality follows from this condition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to investigate whether physically - sensible definitions of entropy for more general probabilistic theories satisfy the three mentioned properties , and hence a generalized version of quantum information causality . </S>",
    "<S> a different version of information causality in more general probabilistic theories has been considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum information causality implies an upper bound on the success probability in the qic game : @xmath56 where we define @xmath57 to be the maximum solution of the equation @xmath58 and @xmath59 denotes the binary entropy . the value of @xmath57 is a strictly increasing function of the ratio @xmath60 , achieving @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 if @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have that @xmath37 if @xmath17 . a plot with some values of @xmath57 and the complete proof of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m5 ] ) are given in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> below we present a sketch of the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we notice that for any strategy that alice and bob may play that achieves success probability @xmath65 , there exists a covariant strategy achieving the same value of @xmath65 that alice and bob can perform . by covariance , </S>",
    "<S> we mean the following : in version ii of the qic game , if , when alice s input qubit @xmath66 is in the state @xmath26 , bob s output qubit state is @xmath24 , then , when @xmath66 is in the state @xmath67 , bob s output state is @xmath68 , for any qubit state @xmath69 and unitary operation @xmath70 . recall that @xmath71 is the number that charlie gives bob . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , without loss of generality , we consider that a covariant strategy is implemented . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the bloch sphere of the qubit @xmath66 is contracted uniformly and output in the qubit @xmath13 . in version </S>",
    "<S> i , this means that the joint system @xmath20 is transformed into the state @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes @xmath75 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the depolarizing map @xcite is applied to the qubit @xmath66 , and output by bob in the qubit @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> then , we use the data - processing inequality and the fact that the qubits @xmath7 and @xmath76 are in a product state for every @xmath77 in order to show that @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that since charlie s and bob s systems are initially uncorrelated , eq .  ( [ eq : m4 ] ) reduces to @xmath79 . thus , we have that @xmath80 . from this inequality and the concavity property of the von neumann entropy </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an upper bound on @xmath81 , which from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : m7 ] ) equals @xmath65 .    below </S>",
    "<S> we show that an optimal strategy to play the qic game reduces to an optimal strategy to perform the following task .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the ic-2 game_. alice is given random numbers @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , for @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> bob is given a random value of @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the game s goal is that bob outputs @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob can perform any strategy allowed by quantum physics with the only condition that communication is limited to a single message of @xmath87 bits from alice to bob . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , alice and bob may share an arbitrary entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath88 be bob s output , where @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the success probability as @xmath90    we call this task the _ </S>",
    "<S> ic-2 _ game . </S>",
    "<S> the version we call the _ </S>",
    "<S> ic-1 _ game , in which the inputs and output are one bit values and alice s message is of @xmath17 bits , was considered in the paper that introduced information causality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strategies to play the ic-1 game in which no entanglement is used were first considered by wiesner in 1983 with the name of conjugate coding @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were investigated further in 2002 with the name of random access codes ( racs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most general quantum strategy , in which alice and bob share an arbitrary entangled state , is called an entanglement - assisted random access code ( earac ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath91 be the maximum value of @xmath92 over all possible strategies to play the ic-2 game . </S>",
    "<S> below we show that @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the following strategy to play the ic-2 game . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob initially share a singlet state in the qubits @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> alice has the system @xmath94 , while bob has the system @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> alice applies the unitary operation @xmath95 on the qubit @xmath6 , for every @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the identity operator acting on @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> then , alice and bob play the qic game , applying some operation on the input system @xmath102 , which includes a message of @xmath2 qubits from alice to bob . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of sending these @xmath2 qubits directly , alice teleports @xcite them to bob . </S>",
    "<S> thus , communication consists of @xmath3 bits only , as required . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , bob does not apply any operations on the system @xmath40 , which is consistent with the qic game . </S>",
    "<S> as previously indicated , we can consider that in a general strategy in the qic game the depolarizing map is applied to the qubit @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , bob outputs the qubit @xmath13 in the joint state @xmath103 with the qubit @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m7 ] ) . then , bob measures @xmath104 in the bell basis . </S>",
    "<S> bob learns the encoded value @xmath86 with probability @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m8 ] ) we have that @xmath106 , which equals @xmath65 , as we can see from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : m7 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since by definition @xmath107 , we have that @xmath108 , as claimed .    consider the following class of strategies to play the qic game that combine quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite ( sdc ) and the ic-2 game .    _ teleportation strategies in the qic game_. alice and bob share a singlet state in the qubits @xmath109 , at alice s site , and @xmath110 , at bob s site , for @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> alice applies a bell measurement on her qubits @xmath112 and obtains the two bit outcome @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the state of the qubit @xmath6 is teleported to bob s qubit @xmath110 , up to the pauli error @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the joint state of the system @xmath113 transforms into one of the four bell states , according to the value of @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob play the ic-2 game with alice s and bob s inputs being @xmath115 and @xmath71 , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . however , instead of sending bob the @xmath116bits message directly , alice encodes it in @xmath2 qubits via sdc . </S>",
    "<S> bob receives the @xmath2 qubits and decodes the correct @xmath3-bits message , which he inputs to his part of the ic-2 game . </S>",
    "<S> bob outputs the two bit number @xmath117 and applies the pauli correction operation @xmath118 on the qubit @xmath13 , which then he outputs and gives to charlie . if @xmath119 , the output state @xmath15 of the system @xmath20 is the singlet ; otherwise , we have that @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from the definition of @xmath65 , eq .  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) , we see that @xmath121 , where @xmath92 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m8 ] ) .    therefore , since @xmath93 , we see that an optimal strategy in the qic game is a teleportation strategy in which the ic-2 game is played achieving the maximum success probability @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained an upper bound on @xmath92 for a particular class of strategies in the case @xmath123 ( see supplemental material ) .    the best strategy that we have found to play the qic game in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath123 is a teleportation strategy in which the ic-2 game is played with two equivalent and independent protocols in the ic-1 game . in both protocols </S>",
    "<S> bob inputs the number @xmath71 , while alice inputs the bits @xmath124 in the first protocol and the bits @xmath125 in the second one . </S>",
    "<S> if bob outputs the correct value of @xmath126 with probability @xmath127 in the first protocol , and similarly , he outputs the correct value of @xmath128 with probability @xmath127 in the second protocol , for any @xmath71 , then the success probability in the ic-2 game is @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of @xmath127 that has been shown @xcite is @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> explicit strategies to achieve this value are given by earacs in the case in which @xmath131 and @xmath132 are nonnegative integers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with this value of @xmath92 we achieve a success probability in the qic game of @xmath133 , where the label t stands for _ </S>",
    "<S> teleportation_.    here we have introduced the quantum information causality principle as satisfaction of an upper bound on the quantum information that bob can gain about charlie s data as a function of the number of qubits @xmath2 that alice ( who shares correlations with charlie ) sends bob , eq .  </S>",
