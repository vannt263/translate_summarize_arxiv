    "quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin systems have attracted much interest theoretically and experimentally for a long time .",
    "recently , spin ladders  @xcite , finite - number coupled spin chains [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] , have been studied intensively . in spin ladders with antiferromagnetic ( af ) intrachain coupling",
    ", it is widely believed that odd - leg and half - integer - spin ladders have a gapless excitation , while other ladders possess a spin gap .",
    "a main theoretical support of this prediction is given by the nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) method  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also verified by several experiments  @xcite and numerical methods  @xcite . as a natural extension of spin ladders",
    ", one can imagine spin tubes , which mean spin ladders with the periodic boundary condition for the interchain ( rung ) direction .",
    "in contrast to spin ladders , the simple spin tubes as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) have not been synthesized yet . however , quite recently , a few spin - tube - like materials  @xcite have been reported .",
    "it will accelerate the theoretical study of spin tubes .",
    "it is known that the above even - odd property of ladders breaks down in tubes : the odd - leg spin-@xmath1 tube with af intrachain and rung couplings has doubly degenerate ground states with a spin gap  @xcite .    among these spin ladders and tubes ,",
    "the 2-leg ladders have been studied most intensively . on the other hand , our understanding of ladders and tubes with higher chain numbers and spin magnitudes",
    "have not been progressed well , except for the above even - odd property . in this context",
    ", we consider the low - energy physics of simple spin ladders and tubes , models of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in this paper .",
    "odd - leg af - rung tubes have the frustration along the rung . for such frustrated tubes , the standard nlsm scheme , which assumes some short - range order to occur for the rung direction , is not applicable .",
    "in order to treat all systems containing frustrated tubes , we construct an alternative nlsm method , a simple extension of snchal s method  @xcite , which is a weak rung - coupling approach .",
    "as well known , a topological term appears in the nlsm for the half - integer - spin systems .",
    "since it makes the analysis fairly complicated , we consider only integer - spin systems .",
    "-leg spin ladder ( a ) and tube ( b ) . ]",
    "the spin hamiltonian , which we investigate , is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the integer - spin-@xmath4 operator on site @xmath5 of the @xmath6th chain , and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath0-leg spin ladders ( tubes : @xmath9 ) .",
    "the intrachain coupling @xmath10 is positive , i.e. , af . the final term represents the uniform zeeman energy .",
    "let us explain the strategy dealing with the model ( [ eq1 ] ) below .",
    "we start from the integer - spin-@xmath4 af chain : @xmath11 .",
    "its low - energy physics can be described by an o(3 ) nlsm .",

    "the spin operator is associated with the field @xmath24 through @xmath25 where @xmath26 . a simple estimation method of the lowest excitation energy of @xmath27 , i.e. , the haldane gap , is the saddle - point approximation ( spa ) for @xmath28 .",

    "the nlsm is mapped to a field theory of triply - degenerate bosons @xmath39 with the dispersion @xmath40 .",
    "these bosons may be interpreted as the lowest spin-1 magnons .",
    "equation  ( [ spe-0k ] ) determines the haldane gap @xmath41 as @xmath42 since the accurate values of @xmath43 can be provided by numerical methods  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) inversely fixes the cut off @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , nlsm plus spa is a one - parameter - fitting theory  @xcite .",
    "we next take into account the rung - coupling term perturbatively .",
    "namely , in the nlsm framework , we approximate it as @xmath44 where the subscript @xmath45 means the chain index .",
    "this prescription was first proposed by snchal in the analysis of 2-leg ladders .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ rung ] ) is efficient even for frustrated tubes . from eq .",
    "( [ rung ] ) , it is also found that the total action of the model ( [ eq1 ] ) is a bilinear form of @xmath46 like the single - chain case . on the other hand",
    ", we have to treat @xmath0 constraints , @xmath47 , differently from the single chain .",
    "since the exact treatment of @xmath0 constraints is considerably difficult , we replace them to an averaged one , @xmath48 relying on eqs .",
    "( [ rung ] ) and ( [ ave - const ] ) , we study the model ( [ eq1 ] ) in the following sections .",
    "one should notice the following aspects .",
    "( i ) the perturbative treatment ( [ rung ] ) is valid only for the weak rung - coupling region .",
    "( ii ) the averaging of constraints as in eq .",
    "( [ ave - const ] ) would be a less accurate approximation for larger-@xmath0 .",
    "this section discusses the model ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath49 . as mentioned already",
    ", the effective action of ( [ eq1 ] ) is a bosonic bilinear form under the approximations ( [ rung ] ) and ( [ ave - const ] ) .",
    "therefore , even for ladders or tubes , we can utilize an spa scheme in a similar way of the single - chain case . if we represent the lagrange multiplier for eq .",
    "( [ ave - const ] ) by the same symbol @xmath28 , its spe becomes , at zero temperature , @xmath50 & = &    n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) [ @xmath54 ( @xmath55<l\\leq [ \\frac{n}{2}]$ ] ) ] for ladders [ tubes ] .",
    "( the symbol @xmath56 $ ] stands for the maximum integer @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 . ) in tubes , @xmath59 means the wave number of the rung direction . here",
    ", we used the same cut off @xmath36 as that of the single chain .",
    "this spa leads to @xmath60 magnon bands with dispersions @xmath61 .",
    "the band splitting @xmath62 is , of course , yielded from the hybridization among magnons due to the rung coupling .",
    "each band @xmath63 has a triple degeneracy , which corresponds to a spin-1 magnon triplet ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "bands of _ tubes _ possesses _ six - fold _ degeneracy @xmath66 except for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this extra degeneracy originates from the symmetry under the reflection about the plane including the central axis of tubes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "-leg spin tube . ]",
    "paying attention to these properties of @xmath63 , we can draw the magnon band structure as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "-leg systems .",
    "`` @xmath69-fold '' means the band has a @xmath69-fold degeneracy .",
    "six - fold degenerate bands do not appear in ladders . ]",
    "it is remarkable that _ lowest bands of frustrated tubes have a six - fold degeneracy _ , whereas all other systems have a standard triply degenerate lowest bands .    -leg spin-1 af - rung tubes with @xmath70 . in order to fix @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ spe - nleg ] ) , we used the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) data , @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "the `` 2-leg '' tube means the 2-leg ladder . ]    if we determine @xmath72 from eq .",
    "( [ spe - nleg ] ) , we can discuss the band structure in more detail .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] represents the rung - coupling dependence of lowest excitation gaps in @xmath0-leg spin-@xmath73 af - rung tubes .",
    "it shows that gaps decrease with increasing @xmath74 and @xmath0 , and gap reductions in frustrated ( odd - leg ) tubes are slower than those in non - frustrated tubes .",
    "the latter must reflect the fact that the growth of the af short - range order is disturbed in frustrated tubes .",
    "although all gaps monotonically decrease with increasing @xmath74 within the present scheme , one should recall that the scheme is valid especially for the weak rung - coupling region . actually , it is known and easily expected that the gap growth of the 2-leg spin-1 af - rung ladder turns from a decrease to an increase as @xmath74 exceeds @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us compare our results with the ones of the qmc method . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , it is expected that our results are semi - quantitatively correct within @xmath76 , and are qualitatively reliable even for the weak rung - coupling case of @xmath77 . the main origin of the deviation between two data would lie in approximations  ( [ rung ] ) and  ( [ ave - const ] ) , and the spa .    .",
    "the qmc data is provided by munehisa matsumoto . ]",
    "we consider the effect of the uniform zeeman term briefly . to do so , we should note the following general features .",
    "( i ) all excitations with @xmath63 are regarded as spin-1 magnons .",
    "( ii ) the uniform field @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) induces the zeeman splitting of spin-1 magnons , and the magnon band with @xmath79 goes down linearly with @xmath78 .",
    "( iii ) in general , when a magnon condensation occurs in a 1d spin system conserving the @xmath80 component of the total spin , the ground state becomes one - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll )  @xcite .",
    "taking into account ( i)-(iii ) and the band structure in the previous section , one can expect that a sufficiently strong field @xmath78 induces a two ( one)-component tll for frustrated tubes ( non - frustrated ladders and tubes ) .",
    "we investigated low - lying magnon excitations of integer - spin ladders and tubes  ( [ eq1 ] ) in the weak rung - coupling region .",
    "it was found that lowest excitations of frustrated tubes consist of six - fold degenerate magnon bands , while those of all other systems are standard triply degenerate ones .",
    "in addition , we can also expect that a two ( one)-component tll emerges in frustrated tubes ( non - frustrated systems ) , as the field @xmath78 increases enough .",
    "this expectation , however , is based on the analysis , in which the field @xmath78 does not reach the lower critical value .",
    "we will revisit the effects of the zeeman term via other approaches  @xcite , elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss more detail of our method here and effects of other external fields elsewhere .",
