    "supersolid is the quantum solid with a superflow property .",
    "although the possibility of supersolid has been discussed theoretically about 40 years ago@xcite , extensive and intensive studies have started since kim and chan have reported@xcite the first evidence for the non - classical rotational inertia@xcite in a solid phase of @xmath0he in the torsional oscillator experiments .",
    "subsequently , experimental studies have revealed various puzzling nature in supersolid @xmath1he@xcite : enhancement of elasticity having the same temperature dependence as the resonance frequency shift@xcite , the sensitivity of resonance frequency shift on history of annealing process@xcite and small concentration of @xmath2he@xcite , superflow along the grain boundaries@xcite , ultraslow relaxation dynamics in the dissipation and resonance frequency shift in the torsional oscillator experiments@xcite . as consistent explanations of these experimental results ,",
    "several theories have been proposed such as defect - mediated superfluidity mechanisms@xcite , a non - superfluid glass picture@xcite and intrinsic supersolidity of defect - free crystal@xcite .",
    "supersolid is also related to other systems ; experiments on @xmath1he film realized on graphite suggest a possibility of two - dimensional supersolid@xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensate(bec ) of @xmath3cr might be another possible candidate of the system with a supersolid phase , owing to the long - range dipole - dipole interactions@xcite .",
    "the possibility of supersolid of rydberg atoms has been studied very recently@xcite .",
    "thus , the properties of intrinsic supersolids should be clarified in more detail from broader contexts .    as a phenomenological model of supersolid , pomeau and rica@xcite",
    "have investigated a modified version of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model@xcite , which has a two - body repulsive interaction not of a contact - type but with a finite - range .",
    "the liquid has the excitation energy with roton minimum for sufficiently large repulsive interaction ( or sufficiently high density of particles ) . for larger repulsive interaction ,",
    "the ground state acquires the positional order detected by the bragg peaks .",
    "it has been shown that the solid exhibits the non - classical rotational inertia @xcite and quantized vortices@xcite under a uniform rotation .",
    "while the solid phase could be identified with a supersolid from these results , it was found that the dissipationless flow around an obstacle is not possible@xcite .",
    "it is thus important to see whether the supersolid can sustain the superflow in the presence of obstacles or not .",
    "this is the issue addressed in the present paper .    as",
    "a simplest set - up , we consider the gp equation with a finite - range two - body interaction in one - dimensional systems . we show that the steady flow state exists in the solid phase even in the presence of an obstacle .",
    "the superflow in the presence of an obstacle in a one - dimensional system can be regarded as a dc josephson current .",
    "that is , we examine superflow property of solid phase ( , which we call supersolidity in this paper ) through the dc josephson effect@xcite .",
    "the josephson effects observed in @xmath0he and in bec in cold atoms serve an evidence for superfluidity@xcite .",
    "in addition to the josephson effect , we also discuss two other important superflow properties : the persistent - current effect and hess - fairbank effect in supersolid state in a ring with a potential barrier .",
    "the former effect is a flow property of metastable states while the latter is a property of thermodynamically stable state in which the whole or a part of supersolid is at rest against in a container rotating with a sufficiently small angular velocity .",

    "in this paper , we studied one - dimensional supersolids in the framework of the mean - field theory . in low - dimensional systems ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are large and destroy long - range order@xcite .",
    "therefore , mean - field theories is not necessarily applicable in low dimensional systems . roughly speaking ,",
    "our mean - field description is valid to describe phenomena over the time scale shorter than the inverse of nucleation rates of topological defects ( kink ) ; those defects destroy the phase coherence or positional order in an ordered state .",
    "importance of the results in the present paper lies in simplicity of models showing the josephson effect in supersolid phase and implication to systems in higher dimensions ; our results strongly suggest that the josephson effect is likely to occur in supersolids in higher dimensions . in an earlier work@xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , it was concluded that non - dissipative mass flow around an obstacle is impossible in a two - dimensional supersolid .",
    "there are two possibilities of the cause of the difference .",
    "one is the way of setting boundary conditions . in ref .  ,",
    "the details of the boundary conditions are not available .",
    "the boundary conditions may determine whether or not dissipationless flow is possible .",
    "the other possibility is due to the difference of shapes of the obstacle .",
    "although two - dimensional supersolid could exhibit the josephson effect , dissipationless flow circumventing the obstacle may be impossible .",
    "a two - dimensional solid is characterized by positional order and orientational order ( see e.g. refs .   and ) .",
    "a plate - shaped obstacle corresponding to the josephson effect may distort only positional order , whereas a disk - shaped obstacle may distort positional order and orientational order .",
    "a future problem is to understand these two results , which seemingly contradicts with each other , in a consistent way .",
    "we now discuss how the phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : gpequationforpsiform ] ) . as in the one - dimensional model , the excitation energy @xmath72 in two or three dimensions has the roton minimum when @xmath5 is larger than a certain value @xmath151 and the landau critical current @xmath152 becomes zero at a coupling constant @xmath153 . in two or three dimensions ,",
    "the first - order phase transition between the liquid phase and solid phase at @xmath61 was considered to occur at a coupling constant @xmath154@xcite . at sufficiently small @xmath4 ,",
    "the liquid - solid transition is expected to be first - order .",
    "the phase boundary between the liquid phase and a solid phase is represented by a curve that starts from @xmath155 and terminates when it meets the curve @xmath156 representing the landau critical current .",
    "although the modulation phase ( i.e. , the state with laminar pattern of density ) in two and three dimensions might be no longer stable , there still remains a possibility that this phase is metastable and contributes as an intermediate state to a transient dynamics relaxing from a liquid state to a solid state with @xmath157 .",
    "we also discuss how the critical current @xmath158 of the josephson effect looks like in two and three dimensions .",
    "we expect the overall feature of the curve @xmath96 in those dimensions to be similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagramwithu ] . as a notable difference between one dimension and higher dimensions",
    ", we expect that the curve @xmath96 has a cusp or kink when it crosses the first - order phase boundary between the liquid and the solid phases .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ( lower panel ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : josephsonrelation ] , the superflow property of the solid phase seems to be similar with that of the conventional superfluid .",
    "we discuss a possible difference between the two phases .",
    "in conventional josephson junctions , @xmath4-@xmath84 characteristics has a curve connecting the points @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this curve corresponds to the unstable steady state . in ref .",
    ", it was shown for gp equation with contact - type two - body interaction and the potential barrier @xmath18 , there exists only a single branch that corresponds to the unstable steady state . in the present case we study , on the other hand ,",
    "the number of unstable and metastable branches are unknown .",
    "the structure ( i.e. , the number and stabilities ) of the branches corresponding to steady states in the solid phase might be different from that in the conventional superfluid . from the context of non - linear physics , this implies that the critical current state in the solid phase in the present model might be categorized as a different type of bifurcation points from the critical current state in the conventional superfluids .",
    "the bifurcation theory discusses parameter - dependence of the number and stability of stationary solutions of time - dependent non - linear differential equations@xcite .",
    "the bifurcation point means the critical parameter at which the number or stability of stationary solutions changes . in the present case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : relaxation ] ) has at least one stationary stable solution for @xmath161 and no stationary solutions for @xmath162 .",
    "the critical parameter @xmath96 is thus a bifurcation point .",
    "it is important to identify the type of bifurcation points in the present model in the sense that the type of the bifurcation in the critical current state governs the dynamics in the breakdown of superfluids , such as the emission rate of the topological defects ( solitons and vortices ) around obstacles at @xmath4 slightly larger than the critical value@xcite .",
    "if the critical current state in the solid phase in the present model is identified with a different type of bifurcation point from that in conventional superfluids , then the dynamical properties in breakdown process of superfluid properties is also expected to be unconventional .",
    "the dynamics of the solid phase above the critical current and identification of the bifurcation type are addressed in a future study .",
    "in conclusion , we showed that superflow properties ( josephson effect , persistent current and hess - fairbank effect ) of a solid phase are maintained even in the presence of an obstacle in a one - dimensional gp model with finite - range interaction . a generalization to higher dimensions and the study of the mechanism of breakdown of supersolidity are important future issues .",
