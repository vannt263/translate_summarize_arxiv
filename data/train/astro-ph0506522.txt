    "the formation and evolution of galaxies remains one of the big questions in astronomy . in the currently favoured @xmath2cdm model ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the picture is not wholly satisfactory and some parts of the milky way may have formed in an initial collapse of baryonic material , somewhat akin to the model of galaxy formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "one firm prediction of the @xmath2cdm model is that this accretion of smaller systems should still be ongoing and that the milky way halo should contain a large number of satellite systems .",
    "it has been suggested that , given the model , there are too few satellites actually within the milky way halo  @xcite , although the extent of this discrepancy has been a matter of some debate .",
    "many attempts have been made to resolve this issue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by correcting the measured velocity dispersion of the local satellites to a velocity dispersion of the dark matter components , while more recently @xcite used numerical methods to highlight a scenario whereby these low mass systems are evaporated at the epoch of re - ionization . in the meantime ,",
    "more and more surveys are probing the halo of the milky way revealing structures which may point to the formation history of our galaxy .    the tidal dismemberment of a dwarf galaxy as it falls through the milky way halo is a slow process , with extensive streams of tidal debris existing for long periods of time @xcite .",
    "while ancient remnants have been identified , via phase - space analysis , in our own galactic neighbourhood @xcite , more extensive surveys of the galactic halo , such as the spaghetti survey @xcite and utilizing 2mass @xcite have concluded that there is only a single , major on - going accretion event , that of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite . while this accretion event is adding mass to the galactic halo and provides an important probe of the shape of the dark matter potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lack of other other major accretion events is somewhat disconcerting given the predictions from @xmath2cdm .    as will be discussed in detail in @xmath3[ring ]",
    ", the recently discovered monoceros ring ( mri ) can be interpreted as an additional on - going accretion event within the milky way . investigating the",
    "density and extent of this structure is important when trying to fully understand the impact this type of event is having on the evolution of our galaxy both in the past and into the future .",
    "if the mri is instead the outermost edge of the milky way , mapping the outer reaches of the disk will provide insight into the milky way s past . to this end , we have used the isaac newton telescope wide field camera to continue a campaign to detect this stellar population around the galactic plane mapping out the extent of the mri .",
    "this paper presents the results of a wide - field camera survey of the extensive stellar population thought to represent a continuation of the previous work in this field .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows ; @xmath3[ring ] summarises the extant knowledge of the mri and the associated population of stars while @xmath3[obs ] describes the observational procedure and data reduction .",
    "@xmath3[analysis ] describes the analysis procedure , and the conclusions of this study are presented in @xmath3[conclusions ] .",
    "the first sign of a new structure in the galaxy , the monoceros ring , came from a study of colour selected f - stars drawn from commissioning data from the sloan digital sky survey [ sdss ,  @xcite ] .",
    "obtained in a narrow strip around the celestial equator these revealed two major stellar overdensities in the galactic halo , consistent with an intersection of the streams of tidal debris torn from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy  @xcite . accompanying these , however , was an additional significant overdensity in the direction of the galactic anti - centre , interpreted as being another tidal stream about the galaxy , just past the edge of the stellar disk , at a galactocentric distance of @xmath4kpc and with a thickness of @xmath5kpc , covering over @xmath6 of sky within @xmath7 of the galactic equator",
    ".    given the results of the study of the sdss , @xcite searched for the signature of this stellar population in fields obtained for the isaac newton telescope wide field camera ( int / wfc ) survey  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "identifying the stream as a distinct population in colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , this study found the stars to be extensively distributed ; over 100@xmath0 of the sky within @xmath8 of the galactic equator , suggesting that the stream completely rings the galaxy .",
    "main sequence fitting reveals that the galactocentric distance to the stream varies between @xmath9kpc and @xmath10kpc , with an apparent scale - height of @xmath11kpc .",
    "@xcite suggested that this stream represents debris of an accreting dwarf galaxy , although pointed out that the extant data did not rule out alternatives such as an outer spiral arm or unknown warp / flare of the galactic disk . in fact , they favoured the interpretation of it being a perturbation of the disc , possibly the result of ancient warps .",
    "simultaneously , @xcite presented an analysis of a larger sdss catalog of halo stars obtaining a number of radial velocities in several fields over the stream , finding a velocity dispersion of @xmath12km / s , inconsistent with any known galactic component .",
    "furthermore , these kinematics indicate that the stream possesses a prograde orbit about the milky way with a circular velocity of @xmath13km / s [ note : this revised value was presented in @xcite ] .",
    "metallicity estimates from these spectra indicate the stars are relatively metal poor @xmath14\\sim-1.6)$ ] .",
    "@xcite also concluded the stream represents a cannibalized dwarf galaxy undulating about the edge of the galactic disk .",
    "several other studies have focused upon this stream population ; using the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite identified m - giant stars beyond the disk of the milky way , consistent with the population detected in the optical . again , at a galactocentric distance ( r@xmath15 ) of @xmath16kpc , this arc of stars covers @xmath17 , with a higher metallicity than previously determined @xmath14=-0.4\\pm0.3)$ ] .",
    "@xcite extended this study , obtaining stellar velocities of m - giants selected from 2mass . confirming a velocity dispersion of @xmath10km / s , this study concluded the stream orbits the milky way in a prograde fashion on an orbit with very little eccentricity .",
    "while this may seem problematic for accretion models preferring elliptical orbits , numerical simulations by @xcite suggest that tidal streams in the plane of the milky way can possess quite circular orbits ; these numerical studies , however , also suggest that the accretion event must be young , less than @xmath18gyr since its first perigalactic passage , or any coherent structure would have dissolved .",
    "finally , @xcite noted five globular clusters which are apparently associated with the stellar stream , as well as @xmath9 outer , old stellar clusters , bolstering the argument that it represents an accreting dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite also employed the 2mass catalogue to identify m - giants beyond the disk of the milky way . by considering the projected density of these stars",
    ", this study uncovered north - south anisotropies in the density of m - stars , with arcs above and below the plane of the galaxy .",
    "significantly , @xcite identified a strong overdensity of these stars , @xmath19 of them in roughly 20@xmath0 of the sky at @xmath20 , the constellation of canis major ( cma ) .",
    "this is a similar number of m - stars to that seen in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy and @xcite similarly interpret this population of stars as a dwarf galaxy .",
    "it is probably the progenitor , with an original mass of @xmath21 , of the extensive stream of stars around the edge of the disk of the milky way .",
    "given its mass , if cma does represent an equatorial accretion event , it will , when fully dissolved , increase the mass of the thick disk by @xmath22 .",
    "additional evidence for this accretion interpretation of the cma dwarf comes from @xcite who found the signature of the main body of the dwarf in the background to several galactic open clusters , with the analysis of this population suggesting that it is somewhat metal rich with an age of @xmath23 gyrs , although a blue plume indicates a younger population .",
    "this study also identified several globular and open clusters associated with the dwarf .",
    "recently ,  @xcite have shown that the globular clusters associated with cma possess their own age - metallicity relationship which is distinct from that of the galactic population .",
    "furthermore , the clusters are smaller than expected , if drawn from the galactic population , strengthening the interpretation that they are of non - galactic origin .",
    ", by re - analysing the 2mass data claim the overabundance of m - giants in cma is simply a signature of the warp in the milky way . in response ,",
    "@xcite used 2df data of the canis major region to highlight the velocity disparities between the milky way disk stars and the m - giant overdensity stars .",
    "this has been repeated more recently by  @xcite suggesting the dwarf galaxy cma can now be tentatively accepted as a real entity despite the current debate . connecting cma to the mri",
    "is more problematic due to gaps in the detection of the ring and poor kinematic knowledge .",
    "a recently completed 2df kinematic survey  @xcite of the canis major region may yield results in this area although currently any general conclusions linking it with the mri are speculative .",
    "more information about halo substructure has been recently discovered as @xcite have identified another structure in triangulum - andromedae ( triand ) which extends much further out than the mri .",
    "currently it is not known whether the two are related , although interestingly the detection of the mri by @xcite resides at the edge of this new structure in triand suggesting a connection .    the latest evidence supporting the interpretation of the canis major dwarf galaxy has been presented by @xcite , showing the colour - magnitude diagram of a region ( 0.5@xmath0 x 0.5@xmath0 ) centred on ( _ l_,_b _ ) = ( 240,-8)@xmath0 , the overdensity proposed by @xcite . an upper limit to the heliocentric distance of the galaxy",
    "is found to be 5.3@xmath240.2 to 8.1@xmath240.4 kpc ; this is comparable with previous estimates . by measuring the surface brightness and total luminosity of the dwarf galaxy an estimate of the mass range",
    "is found to be 1.0@xmath25 m@xmath26 @xmath27 5.5@xmath2810@xmath29 .",
    "the tightness of the main sequence they found contradicts the claims that the canis major overdensity is the signature of the galactic warp .",
    "@xcite have completed extensive modelling of the mri and while not conclusively establishing a connection between canis major and the mri , their results are highly suggestive of such a link .",
    "@xcite using all of the current information known about the mri , undertook thousands of simulations , prograde and retrograde , in an attempt to find a model which best fitted the data . while some retrograde models were marginally acceptable , their preferred model was a prograde orbit which includes multiple wraps of the milky way .",
    "this allows for the scenario that the tidal stream has both near and far components .",
    "@xmath3[123m19 ] discusses a field in which this phenomenon appears .",
    "if the dwarf galaxy has completed more than one orbit then the stream must be a much older structure than previously assumed [ cf .",
    "@xcite ] , raising the possibility that the newly discovered triand structure @xcite could be the distant arm of a multiply wrapped tidal stream .",
    "the model of @xcite and the continuing work of those studying this new galactic feature are slowly piecing together this structure , although currently there is no real coverage around the entire galactic plane , these observations hopefully extend the knowledge of the mri and it s potential progenitor the canis major dwarf .",
    "the data was obtained on the isaac newton telescope wide field camera ( int / wfc ) at roque de los muchachos in la palma , canary islands . mounted at the telescope prime focus , this covers 0.29 square degrees field per pointing , imaging onto four 4k@xmath282k ccds .",
    "these possess 13.5@xmath30 m pixels , corresponding to a pixel scale of 0.33 arcsec per pixel .",
    "nine survey regions were chosen , roughly equally spaced between _",
    "_ = @xmath31 . to aid in determining the location of the fields , the model of  @xcite ( see figure  [ figaitoff ] )",
    "was used to predict where we might expect the spread of debris from an equatorial accretion . for each galactic",
    "longitude , two regions symmetrically placed above and below the galactic plane , were imaged .",
    "each target region is a composite of overlapping fields , the number of which depended on time available to observe in each region ( details of the observations are summarised in table  [ obstable ] and presented graphically in figure  [ figaitoff ] ) , but typically with a total area of @xmath5 square degrees . with the representative integration times , the limiting magnitudes are on average for these observations @xmath32 23.3 , @xmath33 22.2 , @xmath34 23.8 and @xmath35 22.8 .",
    "archival data of ( 123,-19)@xmath0 , taken from the m31 survey @xcite , is used as the opposing field to ( 118,+16)@xmath0 .",
    "de - biassing and trimming , vignetting correction , astrometry and photometry were all undertaken with the casu data reduction pipeline  @xcite .",
    "the flat fielding employed a master twilight flat generated over the entire observing run .",
    "each star was individually extinction corrected using the dust_getval.c program supplied by schlegelschlegel / dust / data / data.html ] which interpolates the extinction using the maps presented by  @xcite .",
    "observing several standard fields per night allows the calibration of the photometry to be determined , as described by  @xcite , deriving the ccd zero - points .",
    "these are consistent to within a few percent on photometric nights .",
    "the data reduction pipeline produces a catalogue of all images in each colour - band . rejecting non - stellar images",
    ", the catalogues can be cross - correlated and the colour for individual stars can be determined .",
