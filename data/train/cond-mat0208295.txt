    "@xcite spin splittings and relaxation times have been extracted from these experiments . however , in [ 001 ]  qws , the bia and sia spin - orbit interactions result in the same dependences of spin splittings and spin relaxation times on the wave vector .",
    "therefore it is impossible to determine the nature for the spin splitting . only in the simultaneous presence of both bia and sia of comparable strengths",

    ". however the latter situation is rare in real systems because it requires a special structure design .    in this work ,",
    "the other spin - dependent phenomenon is investigated which is essentially different from the mentioned above .",

    "this leads to an appearance of electric current under absorption of a circularly - polarized light.@xcite the photocurrent reverses its direction under inversion of the light helicity .",
    "microscopically , the circular photocurrent appears owing to a coupling between orbital and spin degrees of freedom . in semiconductors",
    "the coupling is a consequence of the spin - orbit interaction . in two - dimensional systems ,",
