    "this paper is the first in a series of papers in which we numerically study gravitational waves in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the systems studied range from weak gravitational waves with various symmetries , to fully general and highly nonlinear waves .",
    "we study the dynamical evolutions of the waves and the interactions between waves .",
    "that is , we investigate the dynamics of spacetime in its pure ( vacuum ) form , a subject that is important for theoretical , observational , and technical reasons .",
    "this area of research is for the most part uncharted territory due to its mathematical complexity and the need for large scale computational resources that have not been available previously .",
    "the general behavior of three - dimensional ( 3d ) strong gravitational waves , including for example gravitational geons and the formation of singularities , is unknown .",
    "previous analytic and numerical work on pure gravitational wave spacetimes , done in one or two spatial dimensions , has led to many interesting results , such as the formation of singularities from colliding plane waves  @xcite or the formation of black holes by imploding axisymmetric gravitational waves  @xcite and the existence of critical behavior in such systems  @xcite .",
    "these discoveries raise interesting questions about waves in more general 3d spacetimes .",
    "yurtsever has proposed conjectures concerning the criteria for the formation of singularities from wave packets with finite extension in all 3 directions  @xcite .",
    "these conjectures , together with the global structure and local behavior of the singularities so formed , if indeed they can be formed , remains to be investigated .",
    "these questions call for a full 3d study .",
    "gravitational waves are also about to open up a fundamentally new area of astronomical observation : gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "a new generation of interferometric  @xcite and bar detectors  @xcite should detect waves for the first time near the turn of the century . even though any observed",
    "waves are expected to have weakened by the time they reach earth , they are likely to have been generated in regions with strong , highly dynamical and nonlinear gravitational fields .",
    "it is therefore essential to be able to study waves accurately in both the strong and weak field regimes , as well as the long term secular behavior in the transitory intermediate regimes .",
    "the study of pure wave spacetimes will aid us in developing numerical codes to study all three regimes with confidence in the numerical results .",
    "these pure wave studies compliment our program to compute the evolution and the radiation from the coalescence of two black holes in decaying orbits . because black hole and gravitational wave systems each present their own set of technical difficulties , we first study black holes and waves separately , and then combine them after the problematics of each system are identified and understood . in a separate paper  @xcite we have presented results for a pure single black hole spacetime ( i.e. schwarzschild ) evolved in three - dimensional cartesian coordinates , with essentially the same basic code as used here . in future papers",
    "we will present results from evolutions of distorted black holes , including both gravitational waves and black holes .    in this first paper",
    "we focus on examining the difficulties one encounters in evolving relatively low amplitude 3d gravitational waves in cartesian coordinates , and on the strategies we developed to solve those problems .",
    "we begin with low amplitude waves , as one has better physical understanding of what should be happening in such cases .",
    "when the amplitude is very low , the evolution is linear and nothing interesting happens .",
    "what is more interesting is waves in the `` near - linear '' regime , the meaning of which will become clearer throughout the paper . basically , we mean waves which show some nonlinear transient or secular effects that can be observed in our numerical study within the limit of the accuracy and time scale of the evolution that we can currently achieve",
    ". these effects could be due to ( i ) numerical errors ( finite differencing errors ) coupled with nonlinearity , ( ii ) coordinate effects due to nonlinearity , or ( iii ) nonlinear physics .",
    "[ of course there is also a ( iv ) that we have invested a lot of effort in making sure of its absence ( an effort which is not discussed here ) , namely , coding errors ] . in this first paper ,",
    "our aim is to study ( i ) and ( ii ) instead of ( iii ) .",
    "we find that there are indeed cases for which ( i ) and ( ii ) give rise to interesting features in the evolution , but have negligible nonlinear physical effects .",
    "it is nontrivial to distinguish whether a feature is due to ( i ) , ( ii ) , or ( iii ) . to make the distinction between these effects ,",
    "we have implemented many monitors of the evolution , e.g. hamiltonian constraint , pseudo - energy - momentum tensor , curvature components and curvature invariants .",
    "we have the options of using different gauge and slicing conditions , different boundary conditions , different finite differencing schemes , with different orders of finite differencing .",
    "in addition to the codes that evolve the full 3-d nonlinear einstein equations , we have developed other evolution codes for comparison , e.g. , codes that evolve the linearized einstein equations , and codes that evolve a scalar field equation that captures important features of the full einstein equations .",
    "most noteworthy is that we have developed two completely independent codes that are based on two very different analytic formulations of the full einstein evolution equations .",
    "all simulations presented in this paper were run with both codes , and the results were compared in detail .",
    "it is important to point out that the two codes will not produce identical results .",
    "one code is based on a particular gauge choice where that gauge condition is assumed in the evolution equations , whereas the other code has the evolution equations in their completely general from . when a gauge is chosen it",
    "can only be kept to numerical error .",
    "the first of these fully nonlinear codes , which we call the `` g '' ( for general ) code , is based on the standard 3 + 1 adm  @xcite approach to numerical relativity .",
    "it has been written in a fully general way , without specializing the equations to any lapse or shift condition , and without any restrictions on symmetry or initial data .",
    "the second code , which we call the `` h '' ( for harmonic ) code , is based on the first order , flux - conservative , hyperbolic formulation of the einstein equations developed by bona and mass  @xcite .",
    "different finite differencing and evolution schemes have been incorporated into both codes , as well as linearized versions of both formulations .",
    "all these different codes and options were essential in enabling us to sort out the effects ( i)-(iv ) mentioned above .",
    "we discuss three types of testbeds in this paper .",
    "the first test we consider is a single plane symmetric wave packet , propagating in some arbitrary direction .",
    "this problem allows us to compare the dispersive and dissipative properties of the codes for waves propagating in different directions in the 3d cartesian grid , and the resolution needed for a given desired accuracy .",
    "the second type of test we consider is the collision of weak plane wave packets .",
    "the focus here is on an effect caused by a coupling between finite differencing errors and the nonlinearity of the evolution equations .",
    "it manifests itself as a drifting of the metric function in a region where the wave packet has crossed .",
    "we discuss in detail how the cause of this drift can be identified .",
    "we develop a scalar field equation which captures important features of the nonlinear evolution of the einstein equations .",
    "testbeds done with this equation have been crucial in this analysis . we propose that this scalar equation be used as a standard testbed for the numerical study of gravitational waves .",
    "the third type of testbed is an imploding - exploding combination of quadrupole wave packets  @xcite . besides analyzing the accuracy of the numerical evolution ,",
    "the focus here is on the coupling between the motion of the coordinates and the nonlinearity of the einstein equations . with geodesic slicing ,",
    "this coupling manifests itself as a `` dipping '' of some metric functions at the center of the symmetry , at a time long after the implode - explode process .",
    "we study at what amplitude this phenomenon becomes observable .",
    "we report on the analysis carried out in confirming that this behavior is due solely to coordinate motion instead of truly nonlinear physics .    for all three types of testbeds ,",
    "we have studied the evolution of initial data sets which satisfy the constraint equations to linear order , and for the third testbed , data that completely satisfies the constraints , obtained through the york s formalism @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the two kinds of initial data basically lead to the same kinds of evolution for the low amplitude waves studied in this paper , hence we do not discuss the two cases separately unless otherwise mentioned . throughout the paper we restrict ourselves to time symmetric initial data for simplicity when solving for the initial value problem , which is not our major concern in this paper .    in this paper",
    "we use the convention of  @xcite , in which @xmath0 and , as we are studying vacuum spacetimes , @xmath1 does not enter .",
    "the system has no intrinsic length scales except those set by the waves , e.g. wavelength .",
    "this paper is separated into the following sections : section  [ formalisms ] reviews the two different codes we have developed , which are based on the two different analytic formulations of the einstein equations .",
    "we also discuss the numerical methods used in these two codes .",
    "the different tests and comparisons of our codes are presented in sections  [ iii]-[vi ] .",
    "section  [ iii ] is on planewave packets .",
    "section  [ iv ] is on colliding packets .",
    "section  [ v ] discusses a nonlinear scalar field equation that is useful in analyzing the nonlinearity of the einstein evolution equations .",
    "section  [ vi ] is on imploding - exploding quadrupole waves .",
    "section  [ vii ] is a brief discussion and conclusion .",
    "we have developed two independent 3d codes to solve the fully nonlinear set of einstein equations .",
    "as all tests presented in this paper are performed with both codes , this approach allows us to study systematically the effect of not only different numerical methods , of which we have tested several , but also different mathematical formulations of the equations .",
    "the first code we present is the `` g '' code , where g stands for general .",
    "this code uses the standard 3 + 1 adm formulation of the einstein equations .",
    "it is general in the sense that it can be used with arbitrary slicing and spatial coordinate conditions .",
    "the general spacetime metric is of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the lapse function and shift vector respectively .",
    "although the vacuum adm equations are given in many papers , we again show them here so that one may compare them with a second formulation discussed below : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the spatial covariant derivative , @xmath7 is the spatial ricci tensor and @xmath8 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature . while the code admits arbitrary kinematic conditions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in this paper we report only on results obtained with either geodesic slicing ( @xmath9 ) , maximal slicing or harmonic slicing for the lapse function , and zero shift vector .",
    "the maximal slicing lapse @xmath10 is derived by taking the trace of ( [ dtkij ] ) and setting @xmath11 .",
    "the harmonic slicing condition for the lapse is derived imposing the harmonic condition on the time coordinate , leading to the evolution equation @xmath12 where the initial value for the lapse is completely arbitrary .",
    "it is also appropriate to introduce the hamiltonian constraint : @xmath13 although the evolution equations theoretically preserve the hamiltonian constraint in time , this is not generally so in numerically constructed spacetimes .",
    "discretization effects accumulate over time , which can lead to violations of the hamiltonian constraint . the quantity @xmath14 defined in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) therefore offers a means of monitoring errors introduced in the numerical evolution .",
    "equations ( [ dtgij ] ) and ( [ dtkij ] ) are expanded in a 3d cartesian coordinate system and coded in fortran using macsyma scripts written originally by david hobill .",
    "more details of this code are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was applied to black hole spacetimes .",
    "an important point to stress is that the equations have not been specialized in any way .",
    "all gauge degrees of freedom are left general , so that any shift and lapse conditions may easily be imposed . on the other hand , this implies that if a particular gauge choice is used for the initial data ( i.e. , a diagonal form of the metric or a traceless extrinsic curvature ) , the equations themselves are not specialized to that gauge , and this allows for the possibility that the gauge condition may not be strictly satisfied after some evolution due to numerical errors .",
    "we view it as an important strength of this code , as it opens up the possibility of investigating the stability of various gauge choices .",
    "this code is sufficiently flexible that it allows different evolution schemes to be implemented easily , and we have developed the following two numerical schemes that are second order accurate in space and time : a staggered leapfrog with half time step extrapolation , and a `` maccormack - like '' predictor - corrector method .",
    "an essential difference between them is that in the maccormack scheme , all quantities are centered on the same time slices at all times , and therefore no extrapolations or averages are needed to get quantities that are properly centered .",
    "the leapfrog scheme has the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature variables offset by 1/2 time slice , so that although the main time derivative terms are properly centered , a number of important terms in the evolution equations require extrapolations or averaging in time .",
    "the details of these methods have been published elsewhere [ see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite ] , and so we will not present them here ( however see section  [ v ] where we apply these methods to a simplified model problem ) .",
    "the second code ( `` h '' ) is based on the work of bona and mass@xcite that casts the einstein equations in an explicitly first order , flux conservative , hyperbolic form . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of this new formulation to gravitational wave spacetimes .",
    "the general metric is also of the form ( [ 4metric ] ) and spacetime coordinates are chosen such that the shift vector vanishes .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if one restricts the lapse to the harmonic slicing  ( [ harmonic ] ) , one can write the einstein evolution equations as a hyperbolic first order system of balance laws that in vacuum takes the form : @xmath15 & - & \\partial_k\\left[\\alpha\\sqrt{g}\\left(d^{kij } + g^{ki } g^j        + g^{kj } g^i \\right)\\right ]   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\nonumber \\\\        \\qquad        & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{g}}{\\alpha } q^{ik } q^j_k -2\\alpha\\sqrt{g }        \\left[g^{ikl } g^j_{kl } + l^il^j         - g^ig^j \\right]~ , \\label{harm2 } \\\\",

    "note that all the sources ( on the rhs ) account for the nonlinear terms and that the three - dimensional ricci does not appear as it has been split into its transport part and its nonlinear source .",
    "the connection coefficients @xmath17 are constructed from the first derivatives of the metric @xmath18 these derivatives are evolved using eq .",
    "( [ harm3 ] ) . eq .",
    "( [ drivare ] ) is only used in the initial slice .",
    "similarly , the derivatives of the lapse are used on the initial slice to construct @xmath19 and to derive the initial values of the momentum constraint related variables : @xmath20 these variables are evolved using eq .",
    "( [ harm4 ] ) while eq .",
    "( [ gamom ] ) is used to compute the @xmath21 during the evolution .    at present this code",
    "is restricted to use the harmonic lapse condition with a vanishing shift , although recent work  @xcite shows that the same first order , flux conservative , hyperbolic form can be maintained with a wider class of slicing conditions .",
    "results from a code developed with this more recent formulation of the equations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "standard operator splitting techniques allows for the principal part of the system to be treated as a flux conservative first order system .",
    "this kind of system is well known in computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) , where a wide choice of modern and standard numerical methods have been developed . in this case a flux conserving maccormack method is used for the principal part of the evolution system .",
    "note that this is a _ true _",
    "maccormack method , developed for truly first order systems of equations , and not the `` maccormack - like '' predictor - corrector method used in the `` g '' code ( again see section  [ v ] where we apply these methods to a simplified model problem ) .",
    "the discussion above was centered on the two codes we have developed to solve the fully nonlinear einstein equations . in order to help sort out linear from nonlinear effects and physical from numerical effects",
    ", we have also developed linearized versions of both the `` g '' and `` h '' codes .",
    "both codes have been written in such a way that subroutine calls can be made to solve either the full einstein equations or the linearized versions . in this way",
    "all numerical algorithms not associated with the expressions themselves are identical and we can be sure that effects we see are related only to the linearization process , and not to slight differences in coding or numerical techniques that might otherwise arise if different codes were developed .    the general linearized version of the adm equations ( [ dtgij ] ) and ( [ dtkij ] ) are long and unwielding to write out explicitly .",
    "the task is simpler for the harmonic formulation , as it amounts to linearizing the principal part and setting all the nonlinear sources on the rhs of the equations ( [ harm1])([harm4 ] ) to zero . in any case , a simplified set of linearized adm equations results when we set @xmath22 and @xmath23 to second perturbative order .",
    "we will present these equations here to provide a framework for obtaining analytic solutions to the einstein equations at first perturbative order for weak waves .",
    "however , we stress that it is the general form of the linearized equations that we solve numerically , and not the specialized equations presented below .",
    "the perturbation expansion can be written in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the smallness parameter and the superscripts ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) refer to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 order solutions .",

    "( [ linear1 ] ) and ( [ linear2 ] ) then reduce to three equations for the diagonal metric components @xmath32 the hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham ] ) reduces to @xmath33 analytic solutions to equations ( [ lin1pde1 ] )  ( [ linham ] ) are discussed in section  [ linearized ] .",
    "in this section we present a set of code tests involving the propagation of plane wave packets traveling in one dimension .",
    "we evolve these plane wave packets with our full 3d codes to test wave propagation in all three orthogonal directions ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath30 ) independently and to look for any asymmetries in the evolution for debugging purposes .",
    "these results can then be compared with the propagation of waves along some arbitrary oblique angle that is not parallel to any coordinate axis , which tests the accuracy of resolving arbitrary waves on our rectangular grid . since for such waves we can use fewer grid zones in the transverse directions than in the longitudinal directions ,",
    "this allows us to perform tests without severely being constrained by available computer memory as in the full 3d case .",
    "we have checked in all cases we have studied that for very low amplitudes , the evolutions obtained by the full 3d non - linear codes are indistinguishable from those obtained by the linearized codes described in section  [ formalisms ] above .      a solution to the perturbation evolution equations  ( [ lin1pde1 ] )  ( [ lin1pde3 ] ) that is consistent with the hamiltonian constraint ( [ linham ] ) can be given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 satisfying the linear wave equation @xmath38 for linearized plane waves propagating in the @xmath30 direction  @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath39 gives the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge in which the wave amplitudes are purely spatial , traceless and transverse to the propagation direction .",

    ", it can just as easily describe a wave traveling along the @xmath34- or @xmath35-axes , or be generalized to a wave traveling in some arbitrary direction .",
    "we note that the harmonic slicing condition ( [ harmonic ] ) is consistent with geodesic slicing ( @xmath9 ) to first order as long as the traceless gauge ( @xmath50 ) is maintained .",
    "hence the linearized solutions presented above apply to the hyperbolic formulation with no modifications .      in fig .",

    "[ fig : planewave ] we evolve the initial data above , but with @xmath59 and periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the waves are shown at three different times @xmath46 , 10 and 20 . since the wave propagation speed is unity and the outer grid boundaries",

    "we find that in order to keep errors below @xmath73 at @xmath74 , it is necessary to resolve a wavelength with 20 grid points with the `` g '' code and 40 using the `` h '' code . for waves traveling along the diagonal ,",
    "we find the resolution needs to be increased by approximately @xmath75 to get the same error as when the wave is traveling along an axis , as expected .    by looking at the solutions in fourier space",

    "we find , in general , that amplitude errors due to numerical dissipation dominate over phase errors for typical resolutions , and that the maccormack method used in the `` h '' code is significantly more dissipative and dispersive than the leapfrog method of the `` g '' code .",

    "here we consider the collision of two identical plane wave packets . in such cases",
    "one expects to find nonlinear effects , even for vanishingly small amplitude wave packets .",
    "in fact , it is known that when two plane symmetric waves collide when traveling through an otherwise flat background , a curvature singularity is generated in the region where the waves cross due to the focusing effect of the waves  @xcite .",
    "such a singularity gets generated even for arbitrarily weak waves , only the singularity will emerge at a later time .    in figs .  [",
    "fig : colliding]a  e we show an evolutionary sequence of a wave packet collision at the four times @xmath46 , 3 , 6 and 9 for moderately resolved grids with @xmath77 for figs.a - d and @xmath84 for fig.6e .",

    "[ fig : colliding]a , grows in time . for waves with smaller amplitude ,",
    "this remnant is smaller initially , but grows to a large value at late times .    to test if the remnant in fig .",
    "[ fig : colliding]a is a nonlinear effect , in particular , if it is related to the singularity due to the focusing effect , we evolved the same initial data set using the _ linearized _ evolution equations . with linear evolution ,",

    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : colliding]b .",
    "there is no remnant in the solutions for colliding linear plane waves . in view of this",
    ", one might be tempted to conclude that the remnant in case(a ) is due to nonlinear physics .",
    "in fact , we will show this is not the case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : colliding]c we show results from a `` g '' code simulation using the same initial data and resolution but with the maccormack scheme .",
    "the remnant is greatly reduced .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : colliding]d the equivalent simulation performed with the `` h '' code . here",
    "we see similar behavior as the waves approach and collide .",
    "however , after the collision we see that the remnant is nearly nonexistent , and it does not grow appreciably over the time scale of the run . clearly the different numerical methods produce different results in the evolution . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : colliding]e we show the same simulation with the fully nonlinear `` g '' code as before in fig .  [",
    "fig : colliding]a , but now with twice the resolution . in this case",
    "all other features are quite similar , but the remnant is now reduced significantly in amplitude . if we again double the resolution we will see the remnant reduced even further .",
    "we conclude that the remnant observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : colliding]a is a numerical artifact dependent on the numerical method and grid resolution .",
    "so this remnant is _ not _ related to the singularity caused by the focusing effect . on the other hand , we know that there must be a singularity at a later time ; how does it manifest itself ? we note that the weaker the amplitude of the wave , the later in time the singularity will form . based on the colliding packet study in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we expect that the singularity will develop at a time @xmath87 after the collision .",
    "where @xmath47 is the characteristic wavelength , @xmath44 is the characteristic width of the packet , and @xmath88 is the characteristic amplitude of the packet . for the case here , with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , we expect the singularity to appear at @xmath92 , which is far beyond any evolutions shown here .",
    "in fact it is well beyond any time we can accurately evolve to with our present computer resources .",
    "it is tempting to make the singularity appear earlier by increasing the amplitude of the waves , so that the onset of the singularity can be studied .",
    "we have resisted the temptation to do this here , mainly because such a study is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "another reason for not including this study in the paper is that , for a larger amplitude wave , one has to solve the initial constraints to higher order . with the planar symmetry",
    ", the non - linear effect of the wave will introduce a long length scale variation in the metric , which causes a coordinate singularity at some spatial location on the initial slice , and hence requires special treatment .",
    "to investigate the cause of the `` remnant '' in the nonlinear evolutions , we have developed a simplified model problem containing a single scalar field that exhibits similar behavior as the fully nonlinear einstein equations .",
    "we arrive at this nonlinear model by starting with the metric ( [ linmetric ] ) used in the previous studies .",
    "however , now we keep the nonlinear terms in the adm evolution equations ( [ dtgij ] ) and ( [ dtkij ] ) .",
    "these lead to the evolution equation for @xmath37 @xmath93 together , eqs .",

    "our aim here is to investigate the relation between this @xmath95 term and the numerical schemes used for the evolution .",
    "we note that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ model4 ] ) does not generate a solution of the einstein equations as the resulting metric does not satisfy the constraint equations .",
    "we have investigated this model equation using several different finite difference methods that closely parallel those used in the `` g '' and `` h '' codes . here",
    "we will present results for the two methods used in the `` g '' code ; staggered leapfrog with 1/2 time step extrapolation and a maccormack - like predictor corrector scheme with no extrapolation .    for a full understanding of the effect ,",

    "note that in updating the auxiliary variable @xmath100 from time @xmath101 to @xmath102 , we need @xmath103 , but in the standard leapfrog scheme this auxiliary variable only exists on the half time steps .",
    "we approximate this value by extrapolating data from the previous two time steps @xmath104    in the maccormack scheme , we first solve the predictor step for the intermediate variables @xmath105 and @xmath106",

    "the initial data is given by eq .",
    "( [ ffunction ] ) with parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "we also set @xmath112 so that the initial data is a pure gaussian wave packet without sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "all calculations presented here were run at the same grid resolution of @xmath77 .",
    "although the leapfrog and maccormack schemes both perform well on the standard linear wave equation , they behave quite differently on this nonlinear test problem . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b we zoom in on the flat central portions of the afterwake .",
    "although only the results from the leapfrog evolution are shown , we see a similar drift with the maccormack - like evolution , although the drift is orders of magnitude smaller .    to understand these drifts , we note that under the approximation @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which are clearly appropriate in the region of the drift , eq .  ( [ model4 ] ) reduces to @xmath115 which has a solution @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are arbitrary constants . to verify that the drifts are really of this form , we look at the origin after the waves pass through each other and then plot the quantity @xmath119 versus time . the results for the two different numerical methods are shown in fig .",

    "( [ model6 ] ) can be read out from the slopes and intercepts of these curves . for this case",
    ", we find the maccormack scheme has a much smaller drift rate with @xmath122x@xmath123 and @xmath124 , as compared to the leapfrog scheme with @xmath125x@xmath126 and @xmath124 .",
    "just as in the full `` g '' code , the remnant amplitude gets smaller as one goes to higher and higher resolution .",
    "we find that the drifting solution converges away with rates @xmath127 and @xmath128 for the leapfrog and maccormack - like methods respectively .",
    "here we are just using the three values of @xmath120 at different resolutions to calculate the convergence rate @xmath129 @xmath130 ( we note that this unstable mode can also be excited by a single wave packet and appears in the tail after the wave passes some region . )    the drifts shown in this section for the evolution of fig .",
    "[ fig : modeldrift ] , and in the previous section for the evolution of the full einstein equations are now readily understood : the nonlinear evolution equations contain unstable modes .",
    "we note that this is not in contradiction to the expectation that the einstein equations are stable for weak waves ( weak perturbations of the flat spacetime ) .",
    "it is the constraint equations that rule out these unstable modes . in our free evolution code",
    "the constraint equations are not enforced .",
    "this allows the unstable modes to develop after they are excited by the numerical errors in the evolution .",
    "exactly which mode will be excited most and the amount it is excited depends on the details of the numerical scheme . here",
    "we see that the leapfrog scheme as given by ( [ model1 ] ) and ( [ model2 ] ) is more prone to the excitation of the unstable modes of the form ( [ model6 ] ) .",
    "this is because the extrapolation ( [ extrap ] ) leads to inaccuracies that ruin the exact cancellations on the rhs of ( [ model4 ] ) in the trailing edge of the wave .",
    "we have further analyzed this point by ( i ) studying the unstable mode given by ( [ model6 ] ) for the case of a single wave packet , in which the same phenomena occurs ; ( ii ) using a different extrapolation scheme in place of that given by ( [ extrap ] ) , e.g. one based on a second - order taylor expansion ; and ( iii ) by reducing the courant factor by a factor of 10 .",
    "we find that increasing the accuracy of the extrapolation in eq .",
    "( [ extrap ] ) leads to slightly better results as far as the unstable drift is concerned , but none of the methods we tried compare favorably to the predictor - corrector schemes which require no extrapolation .    to confirm that this is the same phenomenon as we observed in the einstein equations",
    ", we have verified that the drift in the wave remnants follows the form ( [ model6 ] ) . for similar grid parameters we find similar values for the coefficients : @xmath131x@xmath132 and @xmath124 for the leapfrog method and @xmath133x@xmath123 and @xmath124 for maccormack - like method .",
    "again , the drifting solution is orders of magnitude smaller for the maccormack - like method .",
    "the third test problem on the construction of general relativistic spacetimes we discuss is the quadrupole waves  @xcite with an imploding  exploding nature .",
    "we use the quadrupole waves to test the 3d propagation of low amplitude waves in our 3d cartesian codes .",
    "as these solutions represent quadrupole waves , they provide standards against which we can compare the codes ability to evolve waves which do not conform to the rectangular geometry of cartesian grids . in the following two subsections , we study these waves first in linear settings and then with full nonlinearity .",

    "the initial data is taken to be essentially the form given by  @xcite , but modified to be time symmetric and contain an ingoing and outgoing wave in such a combination as to make them regular everywhere in spacetime  @xcite .",
    "we note that as small amplitude waves on the minkowski background , the constraint equations are trivially satisfied to first order , but violated to second order .",
    "quadrupole waves that satisfy the full constraint equations will be studied in the next section .",
    "we study the evolution of the waves using both the `` g '' and `` h '' codes .",
    "the g code is run with geodesic slicing , and the h code with harmonic slicing .",
    "we first look at runs with even parity waves having an amplitude of @xmath126 and azimuthal mode number @xmath134 . here",
    "the amplitude is the amplitude given by the eppley packet  @xcite which corresponds to a perturbation in the metric function @xmath135 of about @xmath136 . for such low amplitude waves ,",
    "the difference coming from nonlinearities in the einstein equations is negligible .",
    "initially the wave is at the coordinate center and expands outward as time increases .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole_small]a plots @xmath135 at various times obtained by the `` g '' code and in fig .",

    ", @xmath135 evolves to become nearly unity everywhere . comparing the profile at @xmath137 to the linearized solution in  @xcite , we find that the error in @xmath135 is about @xmath138x@xmath139 .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole_small]c shows the evolution with the `` h '' code .",
    "we see that the results of the two codes are similar .",
    "the error in the `` h '' code at @xmath137 is about @xmath140 .",
    "if we require that the error remains @xmath141 , at @xmath137 we see that we need @xmath142 points/@xmath47 for the `` g '' code and @xmath143points/@xmath47 for the `` h '' . the dispersive nature of the `` h '' code is probably biasing this result by allowing the waves to disperse out faster .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : errortw ] we plot the error , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) , in @xmath135 as a function of grid resolution at time @xmath144 .",
    "again we observe a convergence rate with an exponent of nearly two .",
    "we have also compared other metric components and various components of the riemann tensor , and they all showed results agreeing to high accuracy with the linear analytic solution .",
    "next we study a case of higher amplitude perturbations with @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the evolution using the `` g '' code with geodesic slicing , and resolution @xmath147 is shown for late times in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole]a .",
    "the feature to note is that @xmath135 develops a dip at the origin . to distinguish if the dipping is due to numerical or physical nonlinear effects coming from the increased amplitude , we ran the same initial data with the linear evolution equation option of the code . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole]b .",
    "no dipping is present whatsoever .",
    "this confirms that it _ is _ a nonlinear effect .",
    "as we pointed out earlier , there can be three types of non - linear effects : ( i ) numerical errors coupled with nonlinearity , ( ii ) coordinate effects due to nonlinearity , or ( iii ) nonlinear physics .",
    "we expect all three types to be present in the evolution .",
    "the question is , which one is most responsible for producing this dipping feature .",
    "one might be tempted to identify this dip with the same spurious drifting coming from the coupling of the finite differencing error and the nonlinear term discussed in the previous section , namely effect ( i ) .",
    "both the drift in the previous section and the dip here are secular evolutions in the region where the wave has passed",
    ". however , there is a major difference . in this case",
    ", the dipping is not converging away with higher resolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole]c we show the same quantities now evolved with @xmath148 the dipping becomes slightly worse with the resolution doubled .",
    "we have carried this out at even higher resolutions with runs up to @xmath149 .",
    "we conclude that the dipping is not due to finite differencing error .    at this point",
    "we want to investigate another possibility for the cause of the dipping , which is not included in ( i)-(iii ) mentioned above .",
    "we note that the initial data set that we have used satisfies the initial constraint equations to first order only . while we evolve the initial data with the full nonlinear evolution equation , is it possible that there may be spurious effects due to this contradiction that leads to the dipping ?",
    "this is the subject of the next subsection .      to generate a set of initial data which is similar to what is studied in the previous subsection , we take the linear data as the metric @xmath150 in the conformal space in the york formalism  @xcite . as the linear data set is constructed to be time symmetric with @xmath151 ,",
    "the initial momentum constraint equations are trivially satisfied and it is straightforward to solve the initial hamiltonian constraint equation to determine the conformal factor @xmath152 needed for the physical space metric @xmath153 . for the case where the amplitude is taken to be @xmath132 ( the @xmath150 of which",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole ] ) the conformal factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf]a .",
    "we note that @xmath152 differs only slightly from 1 , so that the initial data obtained through this procedure describes basically the same spacetime as studied in the previous subsection , except that now the initial data satisfy the constraint equation in full , and can be regarded as representing a physical spacetime as described by the einstein equations up to the finite differencing approximation .    the evolution of this initial data is shown in fig .  [ fig : conf]b again using the g code with geodesic slicing , and @xmath154 .",
    "we see that the time development is basically the same as in that of fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrupole]a . in particular , the dipping at the origin at late times is not affected .    after verifying that the dipping is not due to numerical truncation error ( the effect does nt decrease with resolution ) , and that it is independent of whether the ivp is solved or not , there are two possibilities left .",
    "the dipping is either due to ( ii ) nonlinear coordinate effects , or ( iii ) nonlinear physics , as discussed and labeled in the introduction section . to distinguish which one is the main cause , we look at variables that are representative of the actual geometry .",
    "we studied various components of the four dimensional riemann tensor , e.g. , @xmath155 , the riemann invariants @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite , and the pseudo energy - momentum tensor  @xcite @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the part of the four dimensional ricci tensor that is linear in the deviation of the metric from flat spacetime . for simplicity , we assume @xmath158 when evaluating eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) numerically .",
    "we note that this @xmath159 is meaningless if the initial data satisfy the constraints only to the linear order . for this reason @xmath160",
    "is not used in the analysis of any of the linearized initial data in the previous section .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : slicing_tw]a - g we compare the `` g '' code geodesic slicing evolution to the maximal slicing case .",
    "notice that ( 1 ) even while the metric is dipping in the geodesic slicing case all the components of the riemann tensor studied , the riemann invariants , and @xmath161 , all remain small , and are consistent with returning to zero at late times ( see figs.13b and 13c ) .",
    "( 2 ) in the maximal slicing case , there is no dipping of metric components ( fig.13d ) .",
    "( 3 ) there is good agreement in the riemann tensor components , the riemann invariants , and @xmath161 between the geodesic and the maximal slicing cases ( figs . 13e and 13f ) , although the metric functions behave differently . in fig .",
    "[ fig : slicing_tw]g , we show the evolution of lapse in the maximal slicing case .",
    "we see that the lapse is very close to one throughout the spacetime .",
    "this means that in terms of proper time evolved , the geodesic slicing case and the maximal slicing case are not that different .",
    "this strongly suggests that the dipping should be attributed to nonlinear coordinate effects .",
    "the energy of the wave initially sitting at the origin sets the coordinate lines ( which move normal to the slicing in the case of zero shift ) into free fall towards the origin . as the wave moves outward , the geometry near the origin returns to being flat .",
    "however , with geodesic slicing and no shift vector , there is nothing to stop the motion of coordinate lines .",
    "they keep drifting towards the center where the wave was , causing the metric functions to dip there . with",
    "maximal slicing , the motion of the coordinate lines is changed as the normal of the constant time surface changes with respect to the four geometry .",
    "this is enough to stop the secular motion of the coordinate lines in this weak field case without having the lapse collapse in any significant manner .",
    "this kind of gauge problem in evolving with geodesic slicing is well noted in the literature@xcite ) . from eq .",
    "( [ dtkij ] ) we can compute the evolution of @xmath8 for geodesic slicing , which , using the hamiltonian constraint reduces to : @xmath162 the rhs of this equation is always non - negative .",
    "therefore , the convergence @xmath8 of the geodesics tends to increase without limit , resulting in a coordinate singularity on a free - fall time scale .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a full discussion .",
    "here we found that the dipping seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : slicing_tw]a is due solely to this effect .    by comparing the metric functions obtained from a linear evolution to a nonlinear evolution , we can define a qualitative measure of the time at which nonlinear coordinate effects become present .",
    "we do this by defining @xmath163 as the time when the rms relative difference of the linear and nonlinear evolutions disagree by @xmath164 .",
    "since this rms value is a global measure , we expect our results to depend on the specific energy distribution of the wave model that we are evolving . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_crit]a we compare the critical time as a function of the size of the initial metric function perturbation .",
    "we see that the critical times scales roughly as a power law .",
    "the error bars in the graph come from the fact that the data is only analyzed in time intervals of @xmath165 .    to determine the time at which nonlinear geometric effects occur , we define a similar critical time , but now comparing the rms relative difference of the linear and nonlinear evolutions of the curvature invariant @xmath82 .",
