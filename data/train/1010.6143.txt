    "the dynamics of the conformational change of a single polymer chain from a swollen coil to a collapsed globule due to a sudden change in the solvent quality has received much attention over the past decades @xcite .",
    "one of the primary reasons for the continued interest in polymer collapse dynamics is because of its qualitative similarity with the folding transitions seen in proteins @xcite .",
    "it is believed that understanding the collapse transition will enable us to obtain better insight into the conformational transitions in many complex biological systems , and to understand how other bio - molecules such as dna react to a change in their environment .    since the folding or collapse process of a chain mainly occurs in an environment surrounded by solvent molecules ,",
    "it is now widely recognized that it is important to take into account the effects of the solvent - mediated long - range dynamic correlations between different segments of the chain , known as hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) .",
    "although hi does not affect static properties , it seriously alters the dynamic properties of semi - dilute and dilute solutions .",
    "for instance , a recent study @xcite of the diffusion and folding of several model proteins has shown that molecular simulations which neglect hi are incapable of reproducing the expected experimental translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of folded proteins , while simulations that include hi predict the expected experimental values very well .",
    "the study of the folding process of small proteins has also revealed that inclusion of hi hastens the folding process by at least a factor of two @xcite .",
    "the analogous and simpler problem of the kinetics of homopolymer collapse both in the absence and presence of hi has been studied via a variety of different theoretical and numerical approaches @xcite , and it is probably fair to say that a reasonable degree of understanding has been obtained .",
    "although the homopolymer model has been widely used as a prototype to understand the protein folding problem , it can not capture all its complexities .",
    "for instance , an important missing detail in a homopolymer model is the formation of hydrophobic residues ( h ) or amino acids in the core and polar residues ( p ) on the outer surface of a collapsed globule .",
    "moreover , it is believed that the kinetic ability of natural proteins to fold results from the evolutionary selection of the sequence of the molecule s amino acids , which should also result in a unique native structure , i.  e. a collapsed state of vanishing or at least low degeneracy in terms of its ( free ) energy .",
    "these are aspects that can not be captured by a homopolymer model ; rather at least two different types of interactions or `` letters '' are needed to provide the possibility to encode a native structure .    for convenience as well as efficiency in numerical calculations ,",
    "we choose to use a simple two - letter code hp model to study the kinetics of collapse of heteropolymers .",
    "such models have been referred to as prototeins @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a chain is represented by a binary sequence of h ( hydrophobic ) and p ( polar ) monomers .",
    "although the hp model has been widely used to study the protein folding problem as well as heteropolymers in general , almost all the results are obtained from predictions on discrete lattice models @xcite , while direct simulation studies in the continuum are scarce @xcite . from such lattice models one can conclude that only a small fraction of sequences folds uniquely .",
    "furthermore , not all geometric native structures can be encoded in terms of a suitably adjusted sequence @xcite .    for chains of reasonable length ,",
    "the number of possible sequences and conformations is too large for exact enumeration and hence statistical sampling is required . in the present study , we restrict attention to sequences that contain 50% h monomers and 50% p monomers ; there are both biological @xcite as well as theoretical @xcite arguments that this case should be particularly relevant for protein folding . previous theoretical and simulational studies of heteropolymer collapse @xcite have shown that it typically comprises two stages , namely the rapid formation of clusters or micelles along the chain , followed by coalescence , whose speed is rather sensitive to the details of the sequence .",
    "furthermore , the final geometry depends on these details as well and is not always a compact spherical globule .    with the hope of gaining insight into the protein folding problem",
    ", there has been a trend in recent years to design or engineer ( in theoretical or computer models ) sequences that mimic biological evolution such that they rapidly fold to a desired target native structure @xcite . in particular , khokhlov and khalatur @xcite",
    "have introduced such a method for a copolymer chain composed of 50% h and 50% p monomers .",
    "it involves first collapsing a homopolymer chain into its equilibrium compact state and then marking half of the monomers that are closest to the centre of mass as h type while the remaining monomers are marked as p type .",
    "copolymer chains with sequences generated via this method ( also known as `` protein - like '' copolymers ) were found to fold much more rapidly and the native conformations were more stable compared to random copolymers and random block copolymers with the same average block length of h or p polymers .",
    "this result was however obtained for a lattice model without inclusion of hi .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate the same question for an off - lattice bead - spring model under both absence and presence of hi .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the influence of the length of h and p blocks , i.  e. we compare the `` protein - like '' copolymers ( plc ) not only to random block copolymers with the same average block length ( rbc ) , but also to multi - block copolymers ( mbc ) with various different block lengths .",
    "finally , we attempt to identify the key features of an hp sequence that govern the collapse kinetics . in order to capture realistic dynamics",
    ", we use brownian dynamics ( bd ) where hi is taken into account via the rotne - prager - yamakawa ( rpy ) tensor . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "our main guidance in choosing @xmath50 came from previous results on homopolymers @xcite , where this value led to a rapid collapse .",
    "similarly , we found in ref .",
    "that for @xmath51 the homopolymer chain smoothly folds into its final equilibrium compact stage without being trapped in one of its intermediate metastable states .    for all simulations",
    "a time step size of @xmath52 was used , yielding a solution with very small discretisation errors . for further technical details on the bd algorithm ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "the simulation procedure was carried out as a `` quenching '' experiment where the chain was started in a conformation corresponding to good solvent conditions .",
    "the starting conformation was obtained by equilibrating a homopolymer where all interactions are purely repulsive .",
    "this equilibration was done via a bd run without hi for a period of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the longest dimensionless rouse relaxation time , starting from a random walk configuration .",
    "this procedure was repeated roughly 500 times in order to generate a sample of statistically independent starting configurations which were stored for later use in the quenching runs . at time @xmath55 , a sequence of h and p blocks was selected ( see below ) , and attractive interactions between hh pairs were turned on . from then on , the collapse process was monitored .",
    "we have carried out simulations for two different chain lengths of @xmath56 and @xmath57 beads at a fixed h : p ratio of @xmath58 ( i.  e. @xmath59 ) .",
    "we have studied three different families of copolymer chains with sequence types that were either inherited from the parent globule , regular or probabilistic .",
    "the first sequence type is the protein - like copolymer or plc , where the sequence has been generated by the following process .",
    "a homopolymer is picked from the set of 500 stored initial conformations , and then collapsed to a compact globule by making all the beads attractive .",
    "this is followed by marking the interior as hydrophobic h monomers and the exterior as hydrophilic or polar p ones .",
    "typically , this procedure leads to a sequence of h and p blocks which look at least partially disordered when viewed along the chain backbone . the plc sequence generated in this way",
    "is then used to colour a homopolymer from the existing pool of good - solvent conformations , which is different from the one used to initiate the collapse process .",
    "this procedure is repeated 500 times , always ensuring that the homopolymer conformation that is decorated with the plc sequence obtained at the end of the collapse and colouring process , is different from the starting homopolymer conformation . in this way",
    ", we ensure that we have a set of 500 plc chains that differ from each other in sequence and in conformation . during the quench experiment , each of these plc chains",
    "is then collapsed again , leading to 500 independent quench runs per parameter set .",
    "the second family of copolymers is the regular or alternating multi - block copolymer ( mbc ) with block length @xmath60 ( number of monomers in a contiguous h or p block ) .",
    "hence the sequences were of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of block pairs .",
    "no randomness is involved in this architecture ; therefore again the sample size is approximately 500 independent quench runs per parameter set .",
    "the last family is known as the random - block copolymer ( rbc ) in which each block length @xmath60 is an independent random variable sampled from a poisson distribution @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the average block length .",
    "the poisson random variables were generated from a built - in function provided in matlab .",
    "for each of the @xmath65 stored starting conformations we generated one new sequence , such that again we have a total of @xmath66 independent quench runs per parameter set .",
    "we imposed a strict @xmath58 constraint on the ratio of the number of monomers ( h : p ) .",
    "therefore , the h and p blocks were treated separately . since the poissonian random numbers usually do not add up to precisely @xmath67 , we simply replaced the last random number with the remaining block .",
    "we monitor the time dependence of various observable quantities given below , which can be used to characterise the collapse kinetics .",

    "the instantaneous shape of a polymer chain can be determined from its gyration tensor , @xmath71 , whose cartesian components are given by @xmath72 where the cm subscript refers to the chain s centre of mass . for each conformation , we determine the three eigenvalues @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 of @xmath71 , using the convention @xmath76",
    ". the ratios of these numbers give an indication of the deviation of the molecule s shape from a sphere .",
    "the total collapse time @xmath77 is defined as the time needed for the radius of gyration to reach 99% of its total change in size during the transition period in which the chain is transformed from the initial coil to the final state , i.  e. @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the root mean square equilibrium dimensionless radius of gyration in the collapsed state ( defined as the value obtained at the time at which the run was stopped ) .",
    "we also monitor the time dependence of the average cluster size , defined as @xmath80 using the algorithm of ref .  , where @xmath81 denotes the number of clusters of size @xmath82 .",
    "our previous investigation on homopolymers @xcite showed that this definition gives a more consistent picture of the dynamics than other possible definitions involving higher - order moments .",
    "only h - type beads were used to define a cluster .",
    "two h monomers are considered to be part of the same cluster if they ( i ) are not nearest neighbours along the backbone of the chain , and ( ii ) have an interparticle distance that does not exceed a certain value @xmath83 , which we have set ( in our units ) to @xmath84 , following previous studies @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate to note that all averages reported here are estimated by carrying out sample averages across the 500 independent runs , and the reported error is the estimated error in these averages . except in the case of mbc chains , where the sequence is identical across all starting conformations , our data therefore involves double sampling over sequences and starting conformations . in order to avoid overcrowding in the plots , the statistical error bars",

    "the average block length @xmath86 , for both @xmath87 and @xmath85 bead chains , is approximately 3 , which is very close to the value reported for the analogous lattice model @xcite ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we first discuss the effect of block length on the behaviour of the mbc chain .",
    "the simplest type of mbc is the diblock copolymer with @xmath89 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rgsqvsthi ] ( a ) that this diblock chain collapses to its equilibrium state faster than any of the other copolymer chains present in the plot .",
    "this is always true for such a copolymer because one of its ends ( i.  e. the end with the h block ) behaves like a homopolymer chain in a poor solvent , which rapidly folds into its final equilibrium globular state , while the other end behaves like a homopolymer in a good solvent , remaining as a swollen coil . due to the large size of this swollen part",
    ", the chain can not form a compact equilibrium structure and consequently always has a relatively large final equilibrium size .    by reducing the block size to @xmath90 , such that one has 4 blocks ,",
    "one can see two time regimes of collapse .",
    "the first regime represents the early stage of collapse , where each h block of size @xmath60 rapidly folds into a single cluster .",
    "thus at the end of this stage , the chain consists of @xmath91 clusters or pearls separated by strings of p block chains .",
    "since the folding of the h block is entirely homopolymer - like and is unaffected by the p type monomers , the time taken for each of these h block chains to completely fold into a small cluster is quite small , and it becomes systematically smaller for decreasing block size , such that it becomes hardly observable for shorter blocks .",
    "the second regime represents the growth or coalescence of these intrachain clusters into a single large cluster .",
    "these clusters are separated from each other by a string of p block , which has the same size as that of the original h block .",
    "if the separation between the two intrachain clusters is larger than the range of the attractive interaction ( or , equivalently , if the p block length is large enough ) , then these intrachain clusters go through a diffusion - like process .",
    "it is only when they interact with each other , i.  e. when their separation distance comes within the range of attractive interaction , that they coalesce .",
    "thus the growth of the average cluster size is quite gradual in this case .",
    "however , if the p block chain length is sufficiently small , such that two intrachain clusters are within the range of their attractive interaction , then the two clusters quickly coalesce to form a larger cluster and diffusion plays little or no role .",
    "moreover , the average cluster size will also grow much more rapidly , or , equivalently , there is a rapid reduction in chain size .",
    "since the diffusion time increases with the size of the intervening p block @xcite , it is expected that the coalescence time is shorter for smaller p block sizes and consequently the collapse is much more rapid compared to large p block sizes .",
    "furthermore , a large p block size leads to a less compact final collapsed size because blocks of p beads are always repelled from the core of h beads , and they form dangling legs extruding away from the core .",
    "the results for @xmath90 to @xmath92 for mbc chains in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgsqvsthi ] ( a ) also confirm these expectations .",
    "note that for all mbc chains with @xmath93 , the final equilibrium size is still larger than that of the plc chain .",
    "however , when @xmath94 , the mbc chain reaches its equilibrium native state faster , and the final equilibrium size is smaller than that of a plc chain . reducing the block size of the mbc chain to @xmath95 further reduces the final size as well as the total collapse time .",
    "in fact , the data shows that the mbc chain with @xmath95 produces the lowest final equilibrium size compared to all other types of copolymer chains for the entire range of @xmath60 and @xmath86 values that have been investigated .",
    "the total collapse time and the mean square radius of gyration for all three types of copolymers are listed in table  [ tab : exponents ] .",

    "note that for every @xmath60 monomers of h type that fuse with another h cluster , @xmath60 monomers of p type are brought into close proximity , due to the connectivity along the chain . as a result",
    ", a repulsive force builds up as the coalescence process takes place . for the @xmath101 chain ,",
    "the energy gained from coalescence can not overcome this repulsion , and therefore the chain does not form a single cluster of h monomers , i.  e. it can not fold into a spherical compact globule .",
    "the @xmath102 case conforms to this behaviour , with the chain collapsing slower , and the final equilibrium size being even larger than for @xmath103 .",
    "the large repulsive force built up due to the overcrowded presence of p type monomers for mbc chains with @xmath104 can also be observed via the high value of the internal energy @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgsqeqvsevhi ] .",
    "note that the internal energy for mbc chains with @xmath90 and 16 is not reported here because the chains with these block sizes had not yet reached their equilibrium state , which is also subject to large fluctuations .",
    "this figure also clearly indicates that a chain which has the lowest equilibrium size does not necessarily have the lowest internal energy .",
    "moreover , a chain with the lowest internal energy may not fold into the most compact final structure .",

    "this finding is at variance with the results of ref .  , where the plc chain was found to collapse more rapidly and into a more compact structure than the rbc chain with the same @xmath86 .",
    "it is not quite clear what the origin of this discrepancy is ; most likely it is the fact that our model is a bead  spring model in the continuum , while ref .",

    "[ fig : rgsqvst ] .",
    "we find that in general the collapse dynamics is substantially slowed down , compared to the hi case , which corresponds to the observation for homopolymers that the presence of hi ( zimm model ) leads to systematically faster dynamics than in the case when hi is absent ( rouse model ) . in most cases ,",
    "the chains had not even relaxed fully into equilibrium at the time at which the hi runs ( and also the non - hi runs ) were stopped .",
    "for the one case in which equilibrium was reached , we find the same value for @xmath113 as in the case with hi , as it must be .",
    "the qualitative results concerning the influence of the chain architecture on the collapse kinetics remain however completely unchanged : again , the plc chain corresponds to the @xmath106 rbc , but the rbcs with shorter block length collapse even faster .",
    "the observed acceleration of the collapse dynamics as a result of hi is consistent with our previous findings on homopolymer collapse @xcite , where it was shown that for @xmath112 the inclusion of hi reduces the total collapse time by at least a factor of two .",
    "a complete comparison between the total collapse times for cases with and without hi is not reported in this work , due to the slow convergence to equilibrium in the absence of hi .",
    "the only case where equilibrium was reached ( mbc , @xmath101 ) seems to indicate that the speedup is even larger in the present case ( @xmath114 without hi , @xmath115 with hi ) .",
    "since hydrodynamics is a large - scale phenomenon , one expects the effect of hi to be the more dramatic the more extended the objects are .",
    "due to the uncollapsed p strings , the chains stay systematically longer in an extended state than in the homopolymer case , and this is probably the reason why hi has an even stronger effect .",
    "we have simulated @xmath116 chains at various values of the quench depth @xmath117 , in order to study the influence of this parameter , while keeping the block length ( or average block length ) at @xmath118 ( or @xmath108 ) . figure  [ fig : n64rgsqvstevhi ] shows the results for the gyration radius .",
    "for all the quench depths investigated , it can be seen that the mbc chains collapse the fastest and have the most compact equilibrium size , followed by the rbc chains .",
    "out of all three types of copolymer chains , the plc chain collapses the slowest and the final equilibrium size is the least compact .",
    "generally , one would expect that the radius of gyration for a chain at deep quench should be smaller than that of a chain with lower quench values because the stronger attractive interaction would cause the chain to squeeze into a tighter globule .",
    "the above figure shows that a chain smoothly folds into its final compact state for low quench depth .",
    "however , at very large quench depth ( i.  e. @xmath119 ) , a chain gets trapped in a metastable state and stays there for a long time rather than approach its final minimum energy state .",

    "the early stage involves the rapid formation of localised globules along the chain . following this stage",
    ", these globules then coalesce together by fusing with other nearby blobs to form a dumbbell or two pearls separated by linear chain .",
    "finally , the pearls combine to form a sausage which slowly rearranges itself into a compact state .",
    "however , for copolymer chains with sequences consisting of short p blocks that do not fold into a spherical compact structure ( for instance , mbc chains with @xmath122 ) , only the first two distinct stages are observed and the final compaction stage apparently does not occur . furthermore , copolymer chains with sequences consisting of large p blocks , such as mbc chains with @xmath123 and 16 , seem to acquire another distinct stage after the early rapid collapse stage , known as the `` diffusion '' or `` plateau '' regime . during this diffusion stage ,",
    "the number and size of the intrachain clusters remains unchanged due to the large separation between the h blocks .",
    "similar qualitative features of the collapse pathways have also been observed by other authors @xcite .",
    "apart from the snapshots , the asphericity of the chain can also be observed from the eigenvalues of the gyration tensor .",
    "figure  [ fig : eig1by3vsthi ] shows the time evolution of the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue for all three types of copolymer chains with @xmath112 , for various values of the average block length @xmath86 , in the presence of hi .",
    "interestingly , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : eig1by3vsthi ] clearly shows that this ratio of eigenvalues behaves non - monotonically with time .",
    "a similar result is also observed for the ratio of the intermediate eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath124 .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour is mainly due to the non - monotonic nature of the smallest eigenvalue @xmath125 , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : eig1by3vsthi ] .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by the fact that during the collapse of the chain , there is a sudden change in the shape of the chain from an initial `` ellipsoid '' ( note that a typical self - avoiding walk is highly anisotropic ) to a pearl - necklace and finally ( typically ) to a sphere . during this shape transformation ,",
    "the eigenvalue for the smallest principal axis is first reduced to the lowest value , at which the thinnest pearl - necklace chain is formed .",
    "this principal axis then grows in width when the pearl - necklace chain starts to transform by absorbing nearby pearls or clusters , and when the bridging strings of monomers form a final spherical structure .",
    "note that a similar result has also been observed for a homopolymer chain  @xcite .    -40pt    -40pt    -40pt    -20pt    -40pt    -20pt      the growth of the number average cluster size with time for our chosen value of overlapping distance @xmath126 is shown in fig .  [ fig : snn120vsthi ] .",
    "the most striking aspect about these data is their quantitative demonstration of the multi - stage process of collapse kinetics , already indicated qualitatively by inspection of snapshots , in a much clearer fashion than by the data on the gyration radius .",
    "typically , there are three growth regimes : ( i ) collapse of the single h blocks on a fairly short time scale , giving rise to a moderate increase in the mean cluster size @xmath127 ; ( ii ) coalescence of these clusters at a later time scale , resulting in a steep increase in cluster size ; and finally ( iii ) internal rearrangement of the resulting `` sausage '' that does not change @xmath127 anymore . however , for mbc chains with large block size ( i.  e. @xmath90 and 16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : snn120vsthi ] ( c ) ) yet another ( fourth ) regime can be observed , which follows directly the initial single - block collapse , and which is characterised by a constant value of @xmath127 .",
    "this clearly corresponds to the time regime that is needed for the single globules to find each other in a diffusion - like process .",
    "this diffusion regime for mbc chains with large p blocks is also observed in the time evolution of the number of clusters @xmath128 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncnn120vsthi ] : while the @xmath129 chain ( diblock copolymer ) shows a simple decay of @xmath128 to @xmath130 , i.  e. coalescence of smaller clusters to one large globule , the chains with more blocks ( @xmath131 ) exhibit a clear plateau at @xmath132 , i.  e. the number of h blocks . for smaller block sizes ,",
    "such a plateau is no longer clearly identifiable , since the intervening p blocks are too short to keep the h clusters away from each other .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath101 , @xmath128 exhibits a clear maximum , which corresponds to breakup and coalescence of clusters .",
    "furthermore , the plc chain , whose data is shown for comparison , shows just a smooth decay to @xmath130 , without any visible structure .    during the cluster coalescence stage ,",
    "previous studies of homopolymer chains indicate that one might expect a power law @xmath133 we therefore fitted such a behaviour to our data ; the results for the exponent @xmath97 are listed in table  [ tab : exponents ] .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath97 values that we find for our copolymers are always smaller than the value @xmath134 obtained for a homopolymer @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the obtained values differ from each other substantially , it is far from clear that the obtained numbers have much to do with a well - defined asymptotic power law .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the coalescence process involves two competing length scales ( the average globule size of the consolidated clusters , and the size of the p `` loops '' ) makes the application of self - similarity arguments , which are usually employed in order to justify power - law behaviour , rather doubtful . on the other hand , the fact that the @xmath97 value depends systematically on the block length ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zvslhi ] for the homopolymer and mbc chains up to block length @xmath90 ) makes the interpretation of @xmath97 in terms of an _ effective _ exponent , which in reality describes a more complicated dynamics , fairly likely .",
    "noticeably , data for mbc chains with @xmath135 and @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zvslhi ] do not lie on the smooth curve that can be drawn by eye through all the remaining chains starting from the homopolymer chain to the mbc chain with @xmath90 . as discussed earlier , for these two mbc chains ,",
    "repulsive forces build up during the coalescence process due to the close proximity of the p blocks with each other .",
    "this leads to an equilibrium state with the highest energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rgsqeqvsevhi ] ) , and the highest asphericity , as evident from the snapshot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mbcpath ] ) , and the ratio of the largest to smallest eigenvalue ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eig1by3vsthi ] ) .",
    "the non - occurrence of the final cluster consolidation stage into a compact globule as a consequence of the built up repulsive energy is probably the reason for the data for these two chains not following the general trend seen in the case of the other mbc chains .",
    "a similar pattern is seen below in the correlation between the collapse time and block size , and equilibrium mean square gyration radius .    -40pt",
    "-20pt    -40pt    -20pt      the characteristic collapse times @xmath136 for all three types of copolymers with @xmath85 are shown in table  [ tab : exponents ] .",
    "it is observed that for all types of copolymers used in this work , the collapse time is much larger than the collapse time for a homopolymer chain , for which @xmath137 . as has been pointed out earlier , mbc chains with @xmath90 and 16",
    "had not yet reached their equilibrium state during the course of our simulation , and hence the total collapse time for these two chains are not available .",
    "the collapse time also increases systematically with the block size , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauvslhi ] for the homopolymer and mbc chains up to @xmath92 . these data",
    "hence clearly indicate that the block size of p monomers not only controls the duration of the diffusion process , but also the collapse rate of the cluster coalescence stage for copolymers with small p block size where diffusion plays little or no role . the combined diffusion and cluster consolidation process",
    "is thus identified as the decisive rate - limiting factor for the overall collapse .",
    "the absence of these processes for a homopolymer leads to a much faster collapse , and also leads in the case of mbc chains with @xmath135 and @xmath103 , to a departure from the observed trend for the other chains .    in order to understand the relationship between the kinetic accessibility of the final state and the final equilibrium size",
    ", we plot the collapse time versus the final size in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauvsrgsqeqhi ] . except for mbc chains with @xmath135 and @xmath103 ( for the reasons discussed earlier )",
    ", the figure clearly demonstrates that the total collapse time is directly related to the final equilibrium size .",
    "this result reveals a very interesting feature that is somewhat unexpected , i.  e. , a chain with a small equilibrium size tends to fold much more rapidly than a chain with a larger equilibrium size .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that it would take longer for a chain to fold into a more compact equilibrium structure rather than into a loosely packed structure , but the present results suggest the opposite . in ref .",
    "it was pointed out that a pronounced energy minimum is a necessary condition to guarantee that the native state is stable , and that such a minimum is sufficient , for a compact globule with random structures , to rapidly find the native state .",
    "thus the deep energy minimum of the compact structure seems to provide a guide ( or a strong thermodynamic driving force ) for the chain to quickly fold into its final equilibrium state . in the present work ,",
    "we have made no attempts to determine the free energy of the chains .",
    "however , we anticipate that knowledge of the relationship between the free energy of the native state and the size of the native conformation may help in understanding this behaviour better .      -40pt",
    "-20pt    as has been discussed above , the length of p blocks for mbc chains has a very decisive influence on the kinetics ( large blocks lead to a substantial slowing down of the process ) as well as on the equilibrium size ( large blocks increase the size ) . since this influence is very strong , one might expect that in disordered copolymers the presence of such large blocks should also have a substantial influence , _ even if their probability of occurrence is fairly small_. we have therefore analysed the probability distribution of p block lengths for the plc chains that we have generated , and compare it in fig .",
    "[ fig : pblockdist ] to the poisson distributions of rbc chains with similar @xmath86 .",
    "the inset shows the total distributions , but for our purposes the tails of the distributions at large @xmath60 values are of particular interest ; hence they are shown in the main part .",
    "we find the very interesting result that for the plc chains the tail is substantially enhanced compared to the poissonians with @xmath138 .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to assume that it is this enhanced tail that leads to the slowed - down dynamics of the plc , compared to the rbc with identical @xmath86 .",
    "if this correlation is really valid , then one should expect that the lattice plc chains of ref",
    ".   should show a _ deflated _ tail , in comparison to the corresponding rbcs , as a result of different packing behaviour",
    ". it should be quite interesting to test this .",
    "we have shown that brownian dynamics simulations incorporating implicit hydrodynamic interactions can be used to study the dynamics of copolymer collapse in a poor solvent .",
    "our observations regarding the speedup of collapse caused by hydrodynamic interactions , and the existence of at least two stages of collapse , are similar to those that have been reported previously in the literature . due to the inherent computational advantages of an implicit - solvent model , compared to , say , straightforward molecular dynamics with explicit solvent",
    ", we were able to study the phenomena with reasonable statistical accuracy .",
    "the kinetics of collapse can be described as a rapid initial formation of clusters followed by cluster coalescence and sometimes a rearrangement of the final cluster to form a compact state .",
    "it is also found that the presence of p monomers pushes the value of quench depth at which trapping phenomena occur to a higher value compared to the value seen for homopolymer chains .",
    "a striking feature observed here is that the total collapse time is completely governed by the cluster consolidation stage and the rate of collapse of this stage depends on the block size of p monomers along the chain .",
    "it is found that in our model random block copolymers collapse more rapidly than `` protein  like '' copolymers with the same average block length , if the latter are generated by the labelling procedure suggested in ref .  , and this behaviour can apparently be traced back to an enhanced occurrence of long p blocks in the plcs .",
    "we finally emphasise again that our model is intended as a `` toy model '' designed to study the influence of certain aspects ( monomer sequence , hydrodynamic interactions ) on the collapse kinetics , which can not be expected to be directly related to real proteins . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us assume that each model monomer corresponds to a single amino acid residue , with a typical size of , say , @xmath139 , which would then be the value of @xmath140 in real units .",
    "since we are only interested in order  of  magnitude estimates here , this could also be taken as the value for @xmath37 or for @xmath141 .",
    "a chain of @xmath116 or @xmath57 would then correspond to a fairly short polypeptide whose native state would typically need to be described in terms of a much more elaborate geometry ( e.  g. alpha helices , beta sheets ) than just a spherical or sausage  like globule .",
    "the elementary time scale @xmath142 is then found via @xmath143 where @xmath13 , the stokes radius of the model monomer , is given by @xmath144 such that we find @xmath145 for our value of @xmath146 , and assuming the viscosity of water and room temperature , we thus find @xmath147 as our elementary time unit .",
    "a collapse time of @xmath148 in our bd units would thus correspond to roughly @xmath149 .",
    "this value should however not be taken too seriously , since our model does not include bond  bending and torsional potentials and other interactions that would be needed to describe the structure and energetics on such a small length scale .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath140 , which we have essentially just guessed , enters with the third power .",
    "nevertheless , it may be noted that detailed simulations and experiments on real proteins @xcite have also produced collapse times in the microsecond range , whose values are however somewhat larger , for chains that are even shorter . in general , we believe that the simplicity of our model results in a lack of local kinetic barriers , such that our estimate for the collapse time tends to be smaller than the folding time of the `` corresponding '' real protein . in this context , it should also be noted that the interpretation of one model monomer in terms of just one residue is certainly not imperative .",
    "one could as well consider a model where one model monomer corresponds to several residues ( under the assumption that proteins with such long blocks exist ) . in this case",
    ", one would have a larger value for @xmath140 , and therefore a very much larger folding time in real units .",
