    "x - ray surveys with the _ rosat _ and more recently with the _ chandra _ and the xmm-_newton _ observatories have demonstrated that the x - ray source population is a heterogeneous mix of objects comprising ( i ) powerful agns / qsos , ( ii ) galaxy groups / clusters , ( iii ) low luminosity agns , ( iv ) ` normal ' galaxies with x - ray emission dominated by stellar processes and ( v ) a small number of galactic stars ( lehmann et al .",
    "2001 ; barger et al . 2002 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "powerful agns are identified in x - ray surveys by their enhanced x - ray  to  optical flux ratios @xmath7 .",
    "these sources are responsible for the bulk of the diffuse x - ray background ( xrb ) and are therefore important for constraining models on the xrb origin .",
    "in addition to powerful agns , deep surveys with the _ chandra _ observatory reaching fluxes well below @xmath8 have revealed large numbers of low x - ray  to  optical flux ratio sources @xmath9 .",
    "these objects although too faint to significantly contribute to the xrb are detected in increasing numbers with decreasing flux and are likely to outnumber powerful agns below @xmath10 ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "the low x - ray  to  optical flux ratio regime is thought to be populated by low luminosity agns ( llagns ) and ` normal ' galaxies ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "indeed , sources with @xmath11 exhibit enhanced activity attributed to either starbursts or llagns ( alexander et al . 2002 ; bauer et al . 2002 ; hornschemeier et al . 2003 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "even lower x - ray  to  optical flux ratios , @xmath12 , are believed to be quiescent milky way type galaxies ( hornschemeier et al . 2002 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "2003a ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2003 ) although the presence of heavily obscured agns can not be excluded .",
    "deep chandra surveys have provided valuable information on the nature of low @xmath13 sources at fluxes @xmath14 .",
    "these surveys are not however suitable for the study of low @xmath13 sources at brighter fluxes because of the _ chandra _ small field - of - view ( @xmath15 ) . indeed , due to the low surface density of these sources at bright fluxes wide area surveys are required to compile large statistically complete samples to elucidate their nature .",
    "the _ rosat _ satellite with a field - of - view of @xmath16 per pointing has probed the bright flux regime [ @xmath17 but has identified only a small number of low x - ray  to  optical flux ratio sources ( griffiths et al .",
    "1995 ; griffiths et al . 1996 ; georgantopoulos et al . 1996 ; lehmann et al .",
    "this can be attributed to ( i ) the poor positional accuracy of rosat rendering the optical identification of x - ray sources difficult and ( ii ) its low sensitivity making wide area surveys to the limit @xmath18 time consuming .",
    "the latter is particularly true due to the low surface density of @xmath19 sources to the flux limit above requiring large surveyed regions to compile statistically complete samples .",
    "moreover , the insensitivity of rosat to hard x - rays ( @xmath20 ) is a major drawback since heavily obscured agns ( believed to populate the @xmath21 regime ) are expected to emit most of their x - ray energy output in this spectral band .    in this paper",
    "we employ a shallow ( 2 - 10ks ) wide area ( @xmath22 ) xmm-_newton _ survey to explore the nature of the @xmath23 sources to the limit @xmath24 similar to that probed by previous _ rosat",
    "_ surveys . compared to _ rosat _",
    ", xmm-_newton _ has the advantage of significantly higher sensitivity over a wide energy range ( 0.2 - 10kev ) and improved positional accuracy ( @xmath25arcsec ; hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ; mchardy et al . 2003 ) facilitating the optical identification of x - ray sources .",
    "our xmm-_newton _ observations ( hereafter referred to as the xmm/2df survey ) cover an area of @xmath26 much larger than any previous _ rosat _ surveys at the same flux limit .",
    "this is essential to compile a large sample of low x - ray  to  optical flux ratio sources to explore their nature and to constrain the relative fraction of the different x - ray populations .",
    "an advantage of the data presented here is that unlike deep chandra samples ( e.g. brandt et al .",
    "2001 ) limited by the small field  of  view , the xmm/2df survey has sufficient areal coverage to probe the low-@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) universe .",
    "this is essential to explore the nature of the relatively nearby x - ray population and to provide a link between local ( @xmath29 ) and more distant samples .",
    "moreover , our xmm/2df survey has the advantage of high quality follow - up optical spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "apart from our own spectroscopic campaign the xmm/2df overlaps with large scale spectroscopic programs : the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the 2df galaxy and qso redshift surveys ( 2dfgrs and 2qz respectively ) .",
    "these unprecedented spectroscopic databases are complemented by a homogeneous set of multi - waveband ( @xmath30 ) photometric data from the sdss available for part of our xmm/2df survey .",

    "the results are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally section [ conclusions ] summarises our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the north galactic pole f864 region [ ra(j2000)=@xmath34 ; dec.(j2000)=@xmath35 and the south galactic pole [ sgp ; ra(j2000)=@xmath36 , dec.(j2000)=@xmath37 were surveyed by the xmm-_newton _ between may 2002 and february 2003 as part of the guaranteed time program .",
    "the observations consist of a total of 18 pointings split between the sgp ( total of 5 ) and the f864 ( total of 8) regions each with an exposure time of @xmath38ks .",
    "part of this dataset was presented by georgakakis et al .",
    "( 2003a ) . in the present paper",
    "the georgakakis et al . (",
    "2003a ) observations are supplemented by a total of three additional pointings recently obtained by the xmm-_newton _ in the f864 region .",
    "these three fields suffered from elevated particle background or instrumental problems and were re - observed by the xmm-_newton _ between january and february 2003 .",
    "the epic ( european photon imaging camera ; strder et al . 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) cameras were operated in full frame mode with the thin filter applied .",
    "both the f864 and sgp regions overlap with the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) and the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ; croom et al .",
    "both the 2dfgrs and 2qz are large - scale spectroscopic campaigns that fully exploit the capabilities of the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph on the 4 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "these on - going projects aim to obtain high quality spectra , redshifts and spectral classifications for 250000 @xmath39mag galaxies and 25000 optically selected @xmath40mag qsos .",
    "in addition to 2df spectroscopy , the f864 region overlaps with the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "the sdss is an on - going imaging and spectroscopic survey that aims to cover about @xmath41 of the sky .",

    "2002 ) .    unlike the f864 area ,",
    "the sgp region does not have complete and homogeneous ccd photometric coverage . in the absence of good quality photometry for this field we use photographic data from the apm survey calibrated to the johnson - cousin @xmath45-band using ccd photometry available for a subregion of the sgp field .",
    "a full description of the x - ray data reduction and the generation of the pn and mos event files is presented by georgakakis et al .",

    "images have been extracted in the spectral bands 0.5 - 8 ( total ) , 0.5 - 2 ( soft ) and 2 - 8kev ( hard ) for both the merged and the individual pn and mos event files .",
    "we use the more sensitive ( higher s / n ratio ) merged image for source extraction and flux estimation , while the individual pn and mos images are used to calculate hardness ratios .",
    "this is because the interpretation of hardness ratios is simplified if the extracted count rates are from one detector only .",
    "source extraction is performed in the 0.5 - 8kev merged image using the ewavelet task of sas with a detection threshold of @xmath46 .",
    "the extracted sources for each field were visually inspected and spurious detections clearly associated with ccd gaps , hot pixels or lying close to the edge of the field of view were removed .",
    "the final catalogue comprises a total of 516 x - ray sources to the limit @xmath47 .",
    "source detection using the ewavelet task of sas with a detection threshold of @xmath46 is also performed in the individual soft ( 0.5 - 2kev ) and hard ( 2 - 8kev ) band merged images .",
    "a total of 483 and 175 sources are detected in the individual 0.5 - 2 and 2 - 8kev bands respectively to the @xmath46 detection threshold .",
    "count rates in the merged ( pn+mos ) images as well as the individual pn and mos images are estimated within an 18arcsec aperture .",
    "for the background estimation we use the background maps generated as a by - product of the ewavelet task of sas .",
    "a small fraction of sources lie close to masked regions ( ccd gaps or hot pixels ) on either the mos or the pn detectors .",
    "this may introduce errors in the estimated source counts . to avoid this bias , the source count rates ( and hence the hardness ratios and the flux )",
    "are estimated using the detector ( mos or pn ) with no masked pixels in the vicinity of the source .    to convert count rates to flux the energy conversion factors ( ecf ) of individual detectors",
    "are calculated assuming a power law spectrum with @xmath48 and galactic absorption @xmath49 appropriate for both the sgp and the f864 fields .",
    "the mean ecf for the mosaic of all three detectors is estimated by weighting the ecfs of individual detectors by the respective exposure time .",

    "the wfi was mounted at the prime focus of aat giving a pixel size of @xmath56 and a field of view of @xmath57 .",
    "the total integration times were 2400s in all three bands split into four separate 600s exposures .",
    "the observations were reduced following standard procedures using starlink and iraf tasks .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "these provide the instrumental zero point , the atmospheric extinction relation and the colour terms for the conversion from sloan filters to the standard johnson - cousin system used by landolt .",
    "the uncertainty in the zero point estimated using these standard stars is @xmath58mag in all three bands .",
    "source extraction and photometry is performed using the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "total kron magnitudes are measured in the @xmath52 and @xmath59 filters to estimate @xmath60 colours and to transform @xmath52-band magnitudes into the standard johnson - cousin @xmath45-band using the colour transformations derived above .",

    "we find 843 overlapping sources of which 375 are galaxies and 468 are classified stars by apm .",
    "these sources are used to estimate the calibration curve , @xmath62 , giving standard johnson - cousin @xmath45-band magnitude as a function of uncalibrated apm magnitude @xmath63 . since",
    "the apm magnitudes are not corrected for emulsion saturation the calibration curve is expected to be non - linear . following maddox et al .",
    "( 1990 ) we approximate @xmath64 using 2nd and 3rd order polynomials for galaxies and stars respectively ( on the basis of the apm classification ) .",
    "the polynomial fit residuals for both galaxies and stars follow a gaussian distribution with an rms of @xmath65mag .",
    "this is the @xmath66 uncertainty of the calibrated apm magnitudes .",
    "in addition to publicly available spectroscopic data from 2dfgrs , 2qz and the sdss spectroscopic surveys we have initiated our own follow - up spectroscopic campaign of the xmm/2df sources .",
    "a detailed description of these observations will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( georgakakis et al . in preparation ) .    in brief , x - ray sources in the f864 region of the xmm/2df survey with optical counterparts brighter than @xmath67mag were selected for multi - fibre spectroscopy using 2df at the prime focus of the aat .",
    "the 2df consists of two spectrographs and two @xmath68 thinned tektronix ccds each receiving 200 fibres .",
    "the fibres are @xmath692arcsec in diameter resulting in 2 pixel wide spectra on the detectors .",
    "the data were obtained in service time mode during 2003 march 26 . due to poor weather conditions at the time of the observation the total exposure time",
    "was limited to 1h split into two half hour integrations .",
    "the grating used was the 300b providing a dispersion of @xmath70 and a wavelength resolution of @xmath71 ( @xmath72pixels fwhm ) over the range 37007900 .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the pipeline reduction package 2dfdr developed for the reduction of the 2df data .",
    "fibre flat fields were employed to determine the positions of the fibre spectra on each ccd frame and to flat - field the data . a cuarhe arc lamp exposure",
    "was then used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "redshifts were determined by visual inspection of the resulting spectra .",
    "flux calibration has not been performed .",
    "this is due to the difficulty in obtaining absolute flux calibration for the 2df fibres which can differ substantially in their throughput .",
    "this also applies to the 2dfgrs data .",
    "therefore when presenting optical spectra ( see figure [ fig_ngp_spec ] ) we plot raw counts as a function of wavelength .",
    "to optically identify the sources detected in the xmm/2df survey we follow the method described by downes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to calculate the probability a given candidate is the true identification using bayes theorem : consider an optically detected candidate with magnitude @xmath73 at a distance @xmath59 from the x - ray position .",
    "given the surface density of objects brighter than @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the expected number of candidates within @xmath59 is    @xmath75    assuming that source positions are poissonian , the probability of at least one object brighter than @xmath73 within radius @xmath59 is    @xmath76    which reduces to @xmath77 for @xmath781 . in this case , the candidate is unlikely to be a chance association . in the present study",
    "we apply an upper limit in the search radius , @xmath79 and a cutoff in the probability , @xmath80 , to limit the optical identifications to those candidates that are least likely to be spurious alignments .",
    "the background density of sources ( both galaxies and stars ) in the johnson - cousin @xmath45-band is estimated using the sdss @xmath52-band converted to the @xmath45-band using the transformations of fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . at magnitudes fainter than @xmath81mag where sdss is affected by incompleteness we use the @xmath45-band surface density of metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in the f864 region for the optical identification we only consider sdss sources brighter than @xmath81mag to avoid the sdss incompleteness at fainter magnitudes .",
    "similarly , in the sgp region we only consider apm sources brighter than @xmath82mag .",
    "we propose 164 candidate optical identifications out of 291 0.5 - 8kev selected sources in the f864 region and 57 identifications out of 223 x - ray sources in the sgp region .",
    "the probability @xmath83 above is estimated under the assumption that the source positions follow the poisson distribution . to assess the fraction of spurious optical identifications using the real spatial distribution of sources we perform monte carlo simulations .",
    "mock x - ray catalogues are constructed by randomising the positions of the x - ray sources within the area covered by the xmm - newton observations .",
    "the optical identification method is performed on the mock catalogues using the same criteria ( @xmath80 , @xmath84arcsec , @xmath85 or @xmath86mag ) as for the real sources .",
    "this procedure is repeated 100 times .",
