    "the study of excited nucleon states ( @xmath5 ) has long been recognized as an important step towards developing a fundamental understanding of strong interactions .",
    "it is an important part of the effort to understand the structure of the nucleon since the dynamics governing the internal structure of composite particles , such as nuclei and baryons , is closely related to the structure of their excited states . within the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , a clear understanding of the spectrum and decay scheme of the @xmath5 states will reveal the role of confinement and chiral symmetry in the non - perturbative region .",
    "the @xmath5 states are unstable and couple strongly with the meson - baryon continuum states to form nucleon resonances in meson production reactions on the nucleon .",
    "therefore the extraction of nucleon resonance parameters from the reaction data is one of the important tasks in hadron physics . by performing partial - wave analysis of pion - nucleon elastic scattering data mainly during the years around 1970",
    ", many @xmath5 s have been identified . from the resonance parameters listed by the particle data group@xcite ( pdg ) ,",
    "it is clear that only the low - lying @xmath5 states are well established while there are large uncertainties in identifying higher mass nucleon resonances .    with the construction of high precision electron and photon beam facilities , the situation changed drastically in the 1990 s .",
    "experiments at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , mit - bates , legs of brookhaven national laboratory , mainz , bonn , graal of grenoble , and spring-8 of japan have been providing new data on the electromagnetic production of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 final states .",
    "these data offer a new opportunity to to investigate @xmath5 properties , as reviewed in refs.@xcite .",
    "in addition to analyzing the world s data of meson production from @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions , we need to interpret the extracted @xmath5 parameters in terms of qcd .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "the most fundamental way is to confront the extracted @xmath5 parameters directly with lattice qcd calculations and qcd - based hadron structure models . here",
    "the most challenging problem is to handle the contributions from the baryon _ continuum _ which are coupled with the reaction channels .",
    "the second one is to develop dynamical reaction models to analyze the meson production data . here",
    "the reaction mechanisms and the internal structure of baryons are modelled by using guidances deduced from our understanding of qcd and many - year s study of hadron phenomenology . in this article",
    ", we give a review of the dynamical reaction models developed in refs . @xcite .",
    "other approaches for investigating @xmath5 states have been reviewed in refs.@xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the dynamical reaction models describe the meson - baryon reaction mechanisms by using phenomenological lagrangians which are constructed by using the symmetry properties , in particular the chiral symmetry , deduced from many - years studies of meson - nucleon reactions . starting from a set of phenomenological lagrangians for mesons and baryons",
    ", one would ideally like to analyze the meson - baryon reaction data completely within the framework of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation has been taken historically as the starting point of such an ambitious approach .",
    "the complications involved in solving the bs equation in the simplest ladder approximation have been known for long time .",
    "it contains serious singularities arising from the pinching of the integration over the time component .",
    "in addition to the two - body unitarity cut , it has a selected set of n - body unitarity cuts , as explained in great detail in refs .",
    "thus it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to apply the approach based on the bethe - salpeter equation to study @xmath5 states .    since 1990",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions have been investigated mainly by using either the three - dimensional reductions@xcite of the bethe - salpeter equation or the unitary transformation methods@xcite .",
    "these efforts were motivated mainly by the success of the meson - exchange models of @xmath12 scattering@xcite , and have yielded the meson - exchange models developed by pearce and jennings@xcite , national taiwan university - argonne national laboratory ( ntu - anl ) collaboration @xcite , gross and surya@xcite , sato and lee@xcite , julich group@xcite , fuda and his collaborators@xcite , and utretch - ohio collaboration@xcite .",

    "we see that two - pion photo - production cross sections shown in the left - hand - side become larger than the one - pion photo - production as the @xmath14 invariant mass exceeds @xmath15 gev . in the right - hand - side ,",
    "ky ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 production cross sections are a factor of about 10 weaker than the dominant @xmath21 production . from the unitarity condition",
    ", we have for any single meson production process @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes an appropriate phase space factor for the channel @xmath26 .",
    "the large two - pion production cross sections seen in fig.[fig : totcross ] indicate that the second term in the right - hand - side of eq.([eq : unitarity-0 ] ) is significant and hence the single meson production reactions above the @xmath4 region must be influenced strongly by the coupling with the two - pion channels .",
    "similarly , the two - pion production @xmath27 is also influenced by the transition to two - body @xmath28 channel @xmath29 clearly , a sound dynamical reaction model must be able to describe the two pion production and to account for the above unitarity conditions .",

    "the unitary transformation method was essentially based on the same idea of the foldy - wouthuysenth transformation developed in the study of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "it was first developed in 1950 s by fukuda , sawada and taketani @xcite , and independently by okubo@xcite .",
