    "recently we have shown that the pareto law @xcite appears asymptotically ( @xmath0 ) in the distribution of money @xmath1 among the agents in the steady state of a trading market model : @xmath2    when the agents have random saving propensities @xcite .",
    "the market is modeled as an ideal gas where each molecule is identified with an agent , with the additional attribute that each agent has a random saving propensity , and each trading event between two agents is considered to be an elastic or money conserving collision between two molecules . in another model  a geometric model for earthquakes @xcite  we have shown that a power law similar to the gutenberg - richter law @xcite appears in the asymptotic distribution of the overlap @xmath3 between two dynamically intersecting cantor sets : @xmath4    since a geological fault is formed of a pair of fractal rock surfaces that are in contact and in relative motion , it is modeled by a pair of overlapping cantor sets ( the simplest known fractal ) , one shifting over the other .",
    "the overlap between the two cantor sets represents the area of contact between the two surfaces of the fault and hence it is proportional to the energy released in an earthquake resulting from ruptures in the regions of contact .    in both the models we get simple power laws with the exponents @xmath5 .",
    "although these have been obtained separately for the two models , using both numerical and analytic methods , we show here that the two cases have a common feature that results in a common mode of origin of the power laws observed in the distribution of money @xmath1 and fractal overlap @xmath3 .",
    "the derivation of the power laws presented here shows that the common feature is a log - normal distribution in which the normal factor spreads indefinitely thus leaving the power - law factor to dominate the asymptotic distribution .",
    "let us first consider the ideal gas model of an isolated economic system  that we refer to as the market    in which the total money @xmath6 and the total number of agents @xmath7 are both constant ; there is neither any production nor any destruction of money within the market and no migration of agents occurs between the market and its environment .",
    "the only economic activity allowed in the market is trading among the agents . each agent",
    "@xmath8 possesses an amount of money @xmath9 at time @xmath10 .",
    "the time @xmath10 is discrete and each event of trading is counted as a unit time step . in an event of trading ( shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 ) a pair of agents @xmath8 and @xmath11 randomly redistribute their money between themselves such that their total money is conserved and none of the two agents emerges from the trading process with negative money ( i.e. , debt is not allowed ) :    @xmath12    it has already been shown that in the steady state market ( @xmath13 ) the money @xmath1 with the individual agents follow the gibbs distribution @xcite : @xmath14    when there is no restriction on the amount of money each agent can trade with except that it must satisfy the conditions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : local - conservation ] ) . here",
    "@xmath15 represents the economic equivalent of temperature and is defined as the average money per agent in the market .",
    "if each agent saves a fraction @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) of its own money at every trading and @xmath16 is the same for all agents at all time steps , the individual money with the agents in the steady state follows the gamma distribution @xcite . if we consider the effect of randomly distributed saving fraction @xmath18 among the agents @xmath8 , the money distribution in the steady state assumes the form of the pareto law .",
    "the evolution of the agents money in a trading can be written as @xmath19 \\label{eq : evolution - i}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 \\label{eq : evolution - j}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 and @xmath21 are the saving fractions of agents @xmath8 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the saving fractions @xmath18 are quenched , i.e. , fixed in time for each agent @xmath8 and are distributed randomly and uniformly ( like white noise ) on the interval @xmath22 .",
    "the random division of the total traded money is given by the number @xmath23 that varies randomly with the trading events @xmath10 .",
    "the money distribution in the steady state is found to have a long power - law tail ( shown in fig.2 ) that fits with the pareto law for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we also have analytic proofs @xcite of the pareto distribution of money observed in this random - saving gas - like model ; all these proofs proceed by formulating the trading events as scattering processes and show that the pareto distribution is a steady state solution of the scattering problem .    here",
    "we give a simple derivation of the asymptotic distribution of money in the steady state of the market model using an argument of the mean - field type , thereby avoiding the intricacies of the previous proofs . in our approach",
    "the money redistribution equations ( [ eq : evolution - i ] ) and ( [ eq : evolution - j ] ) are reduced to a single stochastic map by taking the product of the two equations : @xmath25    now we introduce a mean - field - like approximation by replacing each of the quadratic quantities @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by a mean quantity @xmath29",
    ". therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution - ij ] ) is replaced by its mean - field - like approximation @xmath30    where @xmath31 is an algebraic function of @xmath18 , @xmath21 and @xmath32 ; it has been observed in numerical simulations of the model that the value of @xmath32 , whether it is random or constant , has no effect on the steady state distribution @xcite ( illustrated in fig .",
    "2 ) and the time dependence of @xmath31 results from the different values of @xmath18 and @xmath21 encountered during the evolution of the market . denoting @xmath33 by @xmath34 , eq . ( [ eq : stochastic - map ] ) can be written as : @xmath35    where @xmath36 is a random number that changes with each time - step .",
    "the transformed map ( eq . [ eq : random - walk ] ) depicts a random walk and therefore the ` displacements ' @xmath34 in the time interval @xmath37 $ ] follows the normal distribution @xmath38    now @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the log - normal distribution of @xmath29 : @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq : log - normal1}\\ ] ]    the normal distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rw - distribution ] ) spreads with time ( since its width is proportional to @xmath42 ) and so does the normal factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : log - normal1 ] ) which eventually becomes a very weak function of @xmath1 and may be assumed to be a constant as @xmath13 .",
    "consequently @xmath40 assumes the form of a simple power law : @xmath43    that is clearly the pareto law ( [ eq : pareto - law ] ) for the model .",
    "next we consider a geometric model @xcite of the fault dynamics occurring in overlapping tectonic plates that form the earth s lithosphere . a geological fault",
    "is created by a fracture in the earth s rock layers followed by a displacement of one part relative to the other .",
    "the two surfaces of the fault are known to be self - similar fractals . in this model",
    "a fault is represented by a pair of overlapping identical fractals and the fault dynamics arising out of the relative motion of the associated tectonic plates is represented by sliding one of the fractals over the other ; the overlap @xmath3 between the two fractals represents the energy released in an earthquake whereas @xmath44 represents the magnitude of the earthquake . in the simplest form of the model",
    "each of the two identical fractals is represented by a regular cantor set of fractal dimension @xmath45 .",
    "this is the only exactly solvable model for earthquakes known so far .",
    "the exact analysis of this model @xcite for a finite generation @xmath46 of the cantor sets with periodic boundary conditions showed that the probability of the overlap @xmath3 , which assumes the values @xmath47 , follows the binomial distribution @xmath48 of @xmath49 :    @xmath50    since the index of the central term ( i.e. , the term for the most probable event ) of the above distribution is @xmath51 , @xmath52 , for large values of @xmath46 eq .",
    "( [ eq : binomial - regular ] ) may be written as @xmath53    by replacing @xmath54 with @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , we can write the normal approximation to the above binomial distribution as @xmath57    since @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 } , \\label{eq : normal - approx'}\\ ] ]    not mentioning the factors that do not depend on @xmath3 .",
    "now @xmath60    where @xmath61 \\label{eq : log - normal2}\\ ] ]    is the log - normal distribution of @xmath3 . as the generation index @xmath62 , the normal factor spreads indefinitely ( since its width is proportional to @xmath63 ) and becomes a very weak function of @xmath3 so that it may be considered to be almost constant ; thus @xmath64 asymptotically assumes the form of a simple power law with an exponent that is independent of the fractal dimension of the overlapping cantor sets : @xmath65    this is the gutenberg - richter law ( eq . [ eq : gutenberg - richter - law ] ) for the fractal - overlap model of earthquakes .",
    "it was also observed in numerical simulations @xcite that @xmath66 for several other regular and random fractals , thus suggesting that the exponent may be universal .    the exact result of eq . ( [ eq : binomial - regular ] ) in ref .",
    "@xcite disagreed with the asymptotic power law of eq .",
    "( [ eq : power - law2 ] ) obtained previously by renormalization group analysis of the model for @xmath62 in ref .",
    "the disparity between the two results had appeared because it was overlooked that the former is the exact distribution of @xmath67 whereas the latter was the asymptotic distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "however the above analysis shows that the power law in eq .",
    "( [ eq : power - law2 ] ) is indeed the asymptotic form of the exact result .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to what is observed in the distribution of real earthquakes : the gutenberg - richter power law is found to describe the distribution of earthquakes of small and intermediate energies ; however deviations from it are observed for the very small and the very large earthquakes .    the fact that the fractal - overlap model produces an asymptotic power law distribution of overlaps suggests that the gutenberg - richter law owes its origin significantly to the fractal geometry of the faults .",
    "furthermore , since this model contains the geometrical rudiments ( i.e. , the fractal overlap structure ) of geological faults and it produces an asymptotic distribution of overlaps that has qualitative similarity with the gutenberg - richter law , we are inclined to believe that the entire distribution of real earthquake energies is log - normal that is wide enough for the gutenberg - richter power law to be observed over a large range of energy values .",
    "in the trading market model , we have shown that the money redistribution equations for the individual agents participating in a trading process can be reduced to a stochastic map in @xmath29 ( eq . [ eq : stochastic - map ] ) . using the transformation @xmath68 , the map was reduced to a random walk in the variable @xmath34 and hence the distributions of @xmath34 and @xmath69",
    "were found to be normal and log - normal respectively ; in the steady state , i.e. , for @xmath13 , the latter was found to assume the form of a power law identical to the pareto law with the exponent @xmath24 .",
    "likewise , in the fractal - overlap model for earthquakes the distribution of overlaps was found to be log - normal for large generation indices @xmath46 of the cantor set and it further reduced asymptotically ( as @xmath62 ) to a power law similar to the gutenberg - richter law for earthquake energies . in both the cases , the original distribution of the relevant variable ( @xmath29 and @xmath3 ) was log - normal in which the normal factor became a very weak function of the variable in the asymptotically ( @xmath13 and @xmath62 respectively ) , thus rendering a power - law form to the distribution .",
    "our derivations of the two power laws in the two vastly different models also indicate the universality of the exponents @xmath70 . in particular , the value of the gutenberg - richter exponent @xmath71 in the fractal - overlap model is clearly independent of the dimension of the fractals used and therefore the result is of a general nature . in the context of this paper it may be mentioned that in a similar fashion pietronero et al @xcite found a common mode of origin for the laws of benford and zipf .",
