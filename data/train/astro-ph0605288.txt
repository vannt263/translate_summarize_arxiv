    "close to half a century has passed since the first detailed spectroscopic observations of a quasi - stellar - object ( qso ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and two decades since the first clear spectroscopic evidence that quasars are located in the centres of much larger stellar envelopes or _ host galaxies _ ( @xcite ) . after this pioneering spectroscopic work ,",
    "most studies have concentrated on imaging , attempting to measure the shape and the luminosity of quasar host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . with better image processing techniques ,",
    "it has become possible to derive information about the stellar content of quasar hosts using multicolour imaging ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but very little effort has been spent on genuine deep spectroscopy , mainly because of the difficulty to accuratly decontaminate the galactic spectrum from the light of the central quasar .    the quasar - host separation problem has been circumvented , at least in part , in three ways .",
    "one is to restrict oneself to samples of obscured quasars ( @xcite ) , with the obvious drawback that samples built in that way are biased , and that there is no easy way to accurately recover the unobscured quasar luminosity .",
    "another technique is to carry out off - axis spectroscopy : the spectra are obtained with the slit of the spectrograph located a few arcseconds away from the quasar ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , residual contamination by the quasar remains difficult to remove completely , the velocity information on the host is lost , and only the external parts of the host can be studied .",
    "finally , the 1d template - spectra of non - active galaxies can be used as a basis to perform eigenvector decomposition ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter method is efficient in drawing general conclusions using very large numbers of objects , but relies on a restricted number of eigenspectra .",
    "this prevents the discovery of unexpected spectral features , e.g. , due to the specific spatial distribution of the gas in each galaxy , to the starburst activity , or to winds and jets escaping from the central agn .    in the present work , we take advantage of a new approach , where the quasar spectra are taken on - axis , i.e. with the slit lying directly accross the nuclear point source .",
    "our quasar - host separation technique relies on a spatial deconvolution of the spectra , using the spectra of neighbouring psf stars .",
    "this method has already been exploited in three previous papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and allows to go beyond previous studies : 1- the spectral properties of the hosts can be determined down to the central kpc ; 2- the stellar and gaseous contributions to the total spectrum can be accurately separated , which is not the case in multicolour imaging ; 3- no prior assumption on the host , neither spectral nor morphological , is necessary during the deconvolution process ; 4- the velocity curve of the host around its central quasar can be measured .",
    "1 arcsec ) is positioned on the quasar , and several others on psf stars .",
    "the remaining slitlets are used to obtain the spectra of neighbouring galaxies.,width=321 ]    recent studies have argued that luminous quasars reside in massive elliptical galaxies @xcite with globally old stellar populations , but with slightly bluer colours than their quiescent counterparts , indicative of an additional younger stellar component ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we show that these general conclusions should be taken with caution , as important information is lacking from their data , such as separation of the gas and stars , velocity fields , gas ionization ,  in particular , we investigate how the central agn affects the evolution of the whole galaxy by carrying out a comparative study between samples of galaxies with and without quasars .",
    "we compare their stellar populations and the ionization state of their interstellar medium ( ism ) . whenever possible , we infer the dynamical mass of the host galaxies and we trace distorsions of their velocity field due to past or present interactions with nearby companions .",
    "our work is a first step towards a larger spectroscopic study of quasar hosts aimed at understanding why some galaxies are active while others are not .",
    "many studies have characterized the morphology of the hosts , but the morphology alone does not reflect the actual stellar and gaseous content of the hosts .",
    "the aforementioned blue colours of quasar hosts confirm that their evolution does not follow a classical path .",
    "it is thus important to understand how their stage of evolution is linked to the nuclear activity .",
    "because of the complexity and because of the variety of physical phenomena at work in quasars and their host galaxies , the observational solutions of this puzzle can only come from combined spectroscopic and imaging studies .    in section  [ sample ] , we present our sample of 20 low - redshift optically luminous quasars . in sections  [ obs ] and [ obsspec ]",
    "we describe the observations and data processing .",
    "imaging is treated in section  [ anima ] , while we give in section  [ overv ] an overview of the spectral analysis , further detailed in section  [ anispec ] .",
    "section  [ dyn ] is devoted to the dynamics of quasar hosts and to the detection of gravitational interactions with companions , while section  [ quasar ] studies the links between the nuclear and host properties .",
    "finally , section  [ redsh ] establishes the relation between the redshift of the quasars and that of their host galaxy . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     [ shift ]",

    "no interpretation possible .",
    "quasar spectrum typical of nlqso .",
    "* he1302 - 1017 ( or pks1302 - 102 ) : this object is the only radio loud quasar in the sample .",
    "it can not be properly classified concerning morphology .",
    "@xcite classify the host as elliptical because of its smooth and elliptical shape from _ hst _ imaging , although they find an exponential profile to fit their data slightly better .",
    "in @xcite it is classified as disc from 2d modelling on nir images , but presents an irregular radial profile .",
    "it is the most luminous object of the sample .",
    "the stellar population of the host galaxy is typical of sc disc population .",
    "it has low gas metallicity and the highest sfr of the hii subsample . from @xcite",
    ", it has two small companions merging in , perturbing the radial velocity curve presented in this paper and probably explaining the irregular radial profile , but without high excitation of the large amount of gas present in this host .",
    "if it is a morphologically disc - dominated galaxy , the stellar and gaseous analyses point to sc - sd where merger - induced star formation and activity appear , giving a counter - example of a luminous radio - loud quasar not hosted by an elliptical . on the other hand , if it is an elliptical galaxy , it must anyway have undergone recent mergers , which have largely enhanced star formation and brought a large amount of fresh gas , able to mask the old stellar populations from our analyses . * he1434 - 1600 : elliptical galaxy with gas ionized by the quasar at large distance from the nucleus , discussed in @xcite .",
    "* he1442 - 1139 : probable s0-like galaxy , with no gas detected . * he1503 + 0228 : normal spiral host galaxy , studied as a test case in @xcite . * he2258 - 5524 : major merger resulting in highly ionized gas and asymmetric rotation curve . stellar population typical of s0-sa galaxy .",
    "quasar spectrum typical of nlqso . * he2345 - 2906 : spiral host galaxy for one of the weakest quasars of the sample ( at the limit of the quasar / seyfert separation ) . the narrow lines in this the quasar are much more prominent relative to the broad components than for all other objects of the sample .",
    "a first striking result is that most quasar host galaxies harbour large amounts of gas ( ionized by stars , by the agn or marginally by shocks ) , irrespective of morphological type .",
    "we can thus safely reinforce the conclusions of @xcite , based on molecular co detection , that high luminosity quasars are generally _ not _ found in normal ( i.e. gas - poor ) ellipticals .",
    "previous mergers or collisions are probably the source of gas for ellipticals .    there is an obvious predominance of globally young stellar population ( 10/15 of the hosts with known stellar content ) . as several hosts with a young stellar population",
    "have unknown morphologies , this observation could be linked to the bluer colours of elliptical quasar hosts in comparison to inactive ellipticals found in several recent multicolour imaging studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the two elliptical hosts for which our stellar population analysis shows a predominantly old population ( he1434 - 1600 and he1029 - 1401 ) are also presenting this type of bluer colours , according to @xcite .",
    "one thus has to conclude that they contain a globally old stellar population , as deduced from lick indices analyses , over which appears an additional fraction of younger stars which account for the blue colour excess , without significantly modifying the spectral absorption diagnostics of section  [ stellpop ] . as the bluer - than - expected ellipticals",
    "display a globally old stellar population with an additional young component , and as most of the host galaxies with a globally young stellar population are disc - dominated , we can probably conclude that most of the hosts with undefined morphologies and young stellar population have a significant disc component .",
    "+ from a statistical point of view , the proportion of discs found in this study ( 8 of the 19 radio quiet quasars , or 7/14 if we remove the nlqsos that are often excluded from quasar samples , thus around 45 % ) is compatible with the proportions found by @xcite and @xcite ( namely around 30 % among radio quiet quasars ) , given the limited number of objects in both samples . but",
    "as these last two studies have used several constraints on target selection , there might indeed be a selection bias in their samples towards ellipticals , while no other constraint apart from luminosity was applied to ours . given that our proportion is a lower limit , the radio quiet quasars probably appear as often in spirals as in ellipticals .",
    "the confirmed spirals show hii regions compatible with rather metal - poor sc to sd types , regarding star formation and gas metallicity .",
    "their black holes are less massive than the ones found in ellipticals ( as expected from the bulge mass - black hole mass scaling relation , @xcite ) , and only a minority present signs of interaction ( 2/8 ) .",
    "the elliptical host galaxies contain ionized gas ( 3/4 ) , have massive black holes and at least 50 % of them present signs of interaction .",
    "the only _ normal _ elliptical , with no gas detected , could not be well deconvolved , so that no detailed analysis of its stellar and gas content has been possible .",
    "it has been claimed that all quasars more luminous than @xmath10 are hosted by massive ellipticals ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "converting this limit to our cosmology gives @xmath11 .",
    "as seen from table  [ sampletab ] , all our quasars but one are brighter than this limit , and even if the most luminous agns lie in ellipticals , we find almost half of them inside disc - dominated galaxies in this magnitude range .",
    "the mean nuclear @xmath12 magnitudes are @xmath13 both for elliptical and for disc hosts , even if we remove the potential nlqsos identified as discs from our sample ( they were excluded from dunlop s sample ) .",
    "this observation that the morphology of luminous quasar host galaxies are not necessarily elliptical was also put forward by @xcite in the case of higher redshift quasars ( @xmath14 ) .        as shown in section  [ quasar ] , interaction obviously brings material ( gas , and probably dust ) to the central part of the galaxy and enhances the accretion rate and power of the quasar .",
    "recent simulations of galaxy mergers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) lead to the same conclusions . the most massive black holes are hosted in systems presently interacting , while we might have expected them in systems at the end of the merging process , as discussed in section  [ cm ] .",
    "the quasar harboured by interacting systems are also more powerful .",
    "on the other hand , half of our quasars are found in non - interacting galaxies , with a majority of spiral hosts ( 6 confirmed discs , 2 ellipticals and 3 undefined ) .",
    "most of them are young gas - rich systems .",
    "the predominance of a disc component ensures that these system have not undergone major mergers , as the latter tend to produce spheroids @xcite .",
    "this suggests that mergers are not the only mechanism for triggering activity , as already proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "alternative mechanisms may be bar - driven accretion ( found to be very efficient for agn fueling for instance in nls1s , @xcite , or for he2345 - 2958 in the present study ) or gravitational instabilities related to spiral arms formation . but",
    "small scale nuclear events , related to an early stage of formation of spiral galaxies , might also trigger activity .",
    "they are undetectable with the spatial resolution of the present observations .",
    "galactic winds arising from central supernovae are plausible drivers of fuel towards the central engine , given that the weak enrichment of gas in heavy elements is measured on global spectra only .    there does not seem to be a single scenario for the evolution of quasars and their hosts , but different evolution schemes lead to different characteristics of the central engine . if the system encounters major merger events , it will lead to a higher bh mass and a more powerful nucleus , but the nucleus could be active as well with less dramatic and smaller scale events in young spiral galaxies , leading to smaller and less powerful quasars .      in 7 galaxies out of 20 , we find gas ionized by the quasar far from the nucleus ( in ellipticals , spirals or undefined hosts ) .",
    "this phenomenon is independent from radio emission , as none of the objects with such long - range ionization is radio loud .",
    "the common characteristics of those galaxies are of course the presence of gas , but also a powerful quasar , and evidences for gravitational interaction , two properties that are linked .",
    "the origin of high ionization may lie in the fact that gas and dust around the nucleus are swept by the interaction and let the powerful nuclear ionizing beam reach large distances throughout the galaxy .",
    "the analysis of gas metallicity in quasar hosts with a hii region - like ism shows abundances at the lower end of typical spiral metallicities .",
    "the nuclear activity in these young systems could slow down the star formation efficiency in some way , hampering the formation of massive stars and slowing down the enrichment of the surrounding gas .",
    "links between star formation and quasar activity @xcite are preferentially found for elliptical hosts where activity seems to enhance star formation .",
    "however , in that case , neither quasar activity nor star formation would be expected in an isolated host .",
    "both are made possible by the presence of gas , probably brought by mergers with younger systems .",
    "we agree with the conclusions of @xcite who , from a study of ultraluminous ir galaxies and qsos , conclude that it is the merging process that triggers both star formation and activity , without finding evidence for any direct influence from one of these onto the other .",
    "in contrast , it does not appear unrealistic to suggest that the quasar activity might slow down the star formation in young , isolated , gas - rich spiral galaxies .",
    "+ further spectroscopic and high resolution imaging investigations of larger samples of quasars and their hosts could allow to confirm the trends found here and allow a sharper tuning of the interpretations and hypotheses on the quasar ignition and evolution .",
