    "event - shape variables characterize geometrical properties of final states observed in high - energy collisions .",
    "they are the simplest class of observables which probe properties beyond the total cross section and have been measured with high accuracy at lep and other @xmath1 machines . due to their inclusive nature , they have little sensitivity to hadronization effects and can be computed perturbatively .",
    "the canonical event shape is thrust @xmath2 . to evaluate the thrust of an event ,",
    "one first determines the thrust axis @xmath3 , which is the direction of maximum momentum flow .",
    "the thrust is then defined as the fraction of particle momentum flowing along the thrust axis .",
    "the variable we consider here is the jet broadening , which measures the momentum flow orthogonal to the thrust axis .",
    "the total jet broadening is defined as @xcite @xmath4 by using the thrust axis to split the event into left and right hemispheres , one can define left and right broadenings @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the total broadening is the sum of these , @xmath7 , and the wide broadening is defined as the maximum of the two , @xmath8 .",
    "one often normalizes the broadening to the total momentum flow which , for massless particles , is equal to the center - of - mass energy @xmath9 of the collision . we use capital letters to denote the normalized values , for example @xmath10 .    for events consisting of two low - mass jets recoiling against each other ,",
    "the thrust is near the maximum value @xmath11 , while the broadening is very small . in this region ,",
    "higher - order corrections are enhanced by large logarithms which need to be resummed to all orders to obtain reliable predictions . for total broadening the leading logarithms",
    "have the form @xmath12 . for thrust",
    "the resummation has been performed to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( n@xmath13ll ) accuracy @xcite , while for broadening only nll resummation is available @xcite . for both observables , the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) perturbative corrections",
    "are known @xcite . for thrust , combining the fixed - order corrections with the resummed result , an accurate value for the strong coupling constant has been determined from a global fit to the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "this yields one of the most precise determinations of @xmath0 currently available .",
    "interestingly , the value comes out almost @xmath14 below the world average @xcite .",
    "it is important to validate this result using other event - shape variables . to this end , we extend in this paper the resummation for the broadening distributions to nnll accuracy .    so far , the only other event - shape variable for which the resummation has been carried out to higher accuracy is the heavy jet mass @xcite . in the two - jet limit",
    "it is , however , closely related to thrust .",
    "in contrast , the jet broadening is not only literally orthogonal , but also its theoretical description in the two - jet region differs in important aspects .",
    "both observables receive contributions from soft emissions and from radiation collinear to the jets , but the momenta scale differently in the two cases . for broadening ,",
    "the transverse momentum of all emissions is of the same order as the broadening , @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , the transverse momenta of soft particles contributing to thrust are power suppressed , @xmath16 near the end - point @xmath11 .",
    "because of this scaling , broadening is sensitive to soft recoil effects , while thrust is not . these recoil",
    "effects modify the higher - log resummation @xcite and were missed in an early analysis @xcite .    for the above reason , also the description of the two event shapes in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite differs .",
    "the effective theory relevant for thrust involves soft particles with power suppressed momenta , which are also called ultra - soft , while the components of the soft momenta are unsuppressed for broadening .",
    "the versions of scet relevant in the two cases are sometimes called scet@xmath17 and scet@xmath18 . while the effective - theory analysis of scet@xmath17 observables is well understood , this was not the case for scet@xmath18 .",
    "one problem was that the loop integrals in the effective theory were not always well - defined in dimensional regularization , another that renormalization group ( rg ) invariance required the low - energy effective theory to depend on the hard momentum scale , which corresponds to the center - of - mass energy @xmath9 .",
    "this dependence arises naturally in scet@xmath17 from the power suppressed momentum of the soft modes , but is naively absent in scet@xmath18 .",
    "both issues are now understood .",
    "the additional singularities can be regularized with an analytic regulator .",
    "the individual soft and collinear contributions then suffer from singularities in this regulator , which cancel once the contributions are combined .",
    "however , the presence of the regulator breaks a rescaling symmetry which is not recovered when the regulator is removed .",
    "this effect is called the collinear factorization anomaly @xcite .",
    "it induces @xmath9-dependence in the low - energy theory .",
    "consistency conditions can be used to show that this @xmath9-dependence exponentiates @xcite . instead of deriving the exponentiation from consistency conditions , one can also obtain it from an rg framework , the so - called rapidity rg @xcite .",
    "the associated framework is special in that one does not evolve from a higher to a lower virtuality , and that there is no physical coupling constant associated with the evolution .",
    "nevertheless , using this formalism one arrives at the same exponentiated @xmath9-dependence .",
    "the early papers on scet@xmath18 processes used versions of analytic regularization which break important properties of the effective theory such as gauge invariance and the eikonal structure of soft emissions .",
    "we have recently shown that only the phase - space integrals suffer from the additional divergences and that the regulator can be introduced in such a way that the factorization structure of the effective theory is maintained @xcite .",
    "the recent work @xcite and our paper provide the first examples of two - loop computations in scet for anomalous observables .",
    "the simple form and the good properties of our regulator were crucial to make these computations feasible .",
    "based on the new formalism , an all - order factorization theorem for the broadening distributions was derived in @xcite .",
    "this allows for higher - log resummations , but in contrast to thrust the available perturbative input was only sufficient for nll accuracy .",
    "in this paper , we derive the missing ingredients for nnll resummation .",
    "these include the one - loop jet and soft functions as well as the two - loop anomaly exponent .",
    "the necessary computations are quite involved .",
    "in addition to polylogarithmic functions the results also contain elliptic integrals . as a check",
    ", we have independently performed the computations analytically and numerically . at small values of the broadening ,",
    "our computation fully predicts the broadening distributions at @xmath19 , and also all logarithmic terms at @xmath20 . by comparing to numerical fixed - order results from event generators",
    ", we verify that we indeed obtain the correct behavior in the two - jet limit .",
    "finally , we present numerical predictions for the resummed rates and discuss scale uncertainties and scheme dependence .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by discussing the factorization theorem for jet broadening and defining the relevant jet and soft functions . in section",
    "[ sec : oneloop ] we perform the one - loop computations of the jet and soft functions",
    ". the main result of our paper is the computation of the two - loop anomaly coefficient , which is described in section [ sec : twoloop ] .",
    "the two sections concerning the perturbative computations are necessarily technical .",
    "the reader only interested in the results can find these in sections [ sec : w ] and [ sec : anomaly ] .",
    "we then derive the nnll resummed result in section [ sec : resummation ] and present predictions for the broadening distributions at lep energies . in section [ sec : fixed ] we compare the perturbative expansion of the resummed result to numerical results of fixed - order event generators .",
    "the necessary expansion coefficients are listed in appendix [ sec : expcoeff ] .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the jet and soft diagrams is discussed in appendix [ sec : numerical ] , and the relevant two - loop matrix elements are given in appendix [ sec : softmatrix ] .",
    "analytic results for the individual diagrams , both in momentum and in fourier - laplace space , can be found in appendix [ sec : diagrams ] .",
    "collider events with low values of the broadening consist of two nearly massless jets recoiling against each other , accompanied by soft radiation .",
    "the relevant factorization theorem has the form @xcite @xmath21 the hard function @xmath22 describes the production of the quark pair at large momentum transfer , before collinear and soft emissions .",
    "it is the square of the quark vector form factor @xmath23 , which is known to three - loop accuracy @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes jet broadening from other dijet event shapes , such as thrust or jet masses , is that the transverse momentum of the soft emissions is of the same size as the one of the collinear partons . as a consequence ,",
    "the jets recoil against the soft radiation , and the factorization theorem involves an integral over the transverse momentum . the broadening is the sum of the soft and collinear broadenings , and the transverse momentum of the collinear radiation is equal and opposite to the transverse momentum of the soft radiation .",

    "also the soft scet lagrangian is equivalent to the usual qcd lagrangian and in all our computations , we will work with the standard qcd lagrangian and feynman rules .    beyond tree level",
    ", a naive definition of the jet and soft functions leads to integrals that are not fully regularized by dimensional regularization , because they suffer from rapidity divergences .",
    "the sum over intermediate states in the above definition contains a prescription to regularize these divergences .",
    "it consists in a modification of the phase - space integrals and amounts to the replacement @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 . as the rapidity divergences",
    "only occur in the phase - space integrals of the additional emissions , we find it convenient to use the standard measure for the tree - level phase space of the @xmath36 pair .",

    "the individual functions suffer from divergences in this limit , which cancel in the convolution .",
    "the jet and soft functions , as well as the broadening cross section itself , are distribution - valued both in the broadening and in the transverse momentum variables . to work with regular functions and to turn the convolutions in ( [ naivefac ] ) into a product ,",
    "it is advantageous to perform a laplace transform of the cross section @xmath42 and to work in impact parameter space rather than transverse momentum space . to this end",
    ", we laplace and fourier transform the jet and soft functions . for the left jet function , for example",
    ", we define @xmath43 and analogously , for the right jet function and the soft function .",
