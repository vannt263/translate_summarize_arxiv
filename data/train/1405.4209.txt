    "determining the faintest star or extended object visible to the naked eye or with a telescope is a problem of interest in light pollution studies , the history of astronomy , and vision science .",
    "it is an issue of public concern and economic importance given the growth of recreational ` dark sky parks ' for amateur astronomy and the imposition of lighting ordinances to preserve the aesthetic quality of the night sky @xcite .",
    "this article will present a model applicable to uniform achromatic targets of any size , seen against background luminance levels ranging from total darkness to daylight , hence relevant to visibility problems in many areas . for low light levels",
    "it will be applied to historical astronomical data and shown to be more accurate than previous models .",
    "visibility is dependent on the luminance ( equivalent to surface brightness ) of the target object , @xmath0 , in comparison with that of the surrounding field , @xmath1 . for an opaque object in front of a background",
    ", the contrast is defined as @xmath2 for a target viewed through a transparent screen ( or an astronomical object viewed through the atmosphere ) the portion covering the target contributes luminance @xmath1 , hence @xmath3 . when the increment @xmath4 is at the threshold of visibility according to specified criteria , then @xmath5 is the threshold contrast . for a target of angular area @xmath6 one can also consider the illuminance ( equivalent to apparent magnitude ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is in candelas per square metre ( cd m^-2^ ) and @xmath6 is in steradians then the apparent increment illuminance at the eye in lux ( lx ) is @xmath7 the modelling problem is to find analytic expressions for threshold @xmath4 or @xmath8 as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "this will then indicate the limiting surface brightness or magnitude for objects seen with the naked eye against a sky with luminance @xmath1 .",
    "telescopic results can be found by applying standard optical formulae which take into account the changes in @xmath6 and @xmath1 imposed by magnification , and factors such as light loss .",
    "@xcite investigated stellar limiting magnitude by adopting a pre - existing model formula for @xmath8 in terms of @xmath1 ( his eq .",
    "2 ) and applying modifications to those quantities .",
    "that work has been particularly important , so similarities and differences with the present treatment will be highlighted throughout this introduction , which also outlines relevant aspects of psychophysics , vision science and photometry .",
    "the model will be constructed in section 2 and shown to give an accurate representation of the laboratory data . in section 3",
    "it is applied to astronomical visibility and tested against historical limiting magnitude data collected at mount wilson , as well as the nebular discoveries of william herschel .",
    "it is shown how the model can be used to make comparative predictions about the effect of sky brightness on telescope performance .",
    "the concluding section discusses the practical definition of ` dark sky ' for the purposes of visual astronomy .      the largest and most authoritative study of contrast threshold was that of @xcite , whose data continue to be used in areas such as lighting engineering and road safety @xcite .",
    "they were used in a popular book for amateur astronomers by @xcite to make graphical predictions of astronomical visibility .",
    "the approach to be taken here is instead analytic , giving rise to formulae relevant to a wide range of visibility problems , and applicable to data other than blackwell s .",
    "blackwell measured luminance in footlamberts , but the data will be presented here in modern units ( 1 fl = 3.426 cd m^-2^ ) .",
    "blackwell investigated both positive and negative contrasts , but only the positive data ( target brighter than surround ) will be considered in this article .    in order that the data can be correctly interpreted it is necessary to consider the experimental method in some detail .",
    "a total of 19 highly trained female observers aged 19 - 26 with approximately 20/20 vision were employed specially for the project ( serving also as data analysts ) .",
    "no gender effect has been reported in the literature , but the age , experience and motivation of the observers is significant .",
    "observers viewed targets using unconstrained ( direct or averted ) binocular vision for effectively infinite time ( i.e. such that doubling of exposure did not alter successful detection rates ) . targets , viewed at effectively infinite range ( over 15 m ) were uniform achromatic ( broadband white ) discs of seven angular sizes ranging from 0.595 arcmin to six degrees . these were either projected or , for the smallest target , transilluminated .",
    "they were viewed against backgrounds ranging from 3426 cd m^-2^ down to zero , and at five levels of contrast ( in relative proportion 0.24 , 0.37 , 0.55 , 0.75 , 1 ) .",
    "observers were always allowed to become fully adapted to the background luminance , and rest periods were given so as to avoid fatigue .",
    "a single session would consist of 320 presentations , and observers were not considered trained until they had participated in approximately 20 sessions , though the published data were based on a far higher level of experience ( 35 - 75,000 observations by each observer ) resulting in ` unusual sensitivity and gratifying stability of response ' .",
    "for every target and contrast level , each observer s probability of detection was found .",
    "for each observer s probability curve ( approximately a normal ogive ) , a graphical procedure was used to extract the contrast value @xmath9 that would correspond to 50 per cent detection , chosen since it could be calculated with highest precision , and @xmath10 , the standard deviation of the normal probability integral .",
    "results from 1500 probability curves were averaged , giving contrast threshold as a discrete function of target size and background luminance : table 7 of @xcite summarises 90,000 observations by seven observers .",
    "smooth curves were drawn as a best fit to these data points , and interpolations made , to produce the final values ( table 8 of @xcite ) .    at ordinary light levels ( for discs larger than 0.595 arcmin )",
    "a ` forced - choice ' procedure was used , in which the target would appear in one of eight possible positions ( or not at all ) , and observers had to indicate where they thought the target was displayed using a selector switch at the end of the viewing period . at low light levels , requiring much longer viewing times , a two - valued forced - choice procedure was used ( ` yes - no ' ) , in which the target was presented ( or not ) at the centre of the screen , and observers had to indicate whether they had seen it , again with a switch .",
    "null targets enabled the effect of random guessing to be eliminated .",
    "the 50 per cent detection level was merely a statistical normalisation : the threshold at any other detection probability @xmath11 could be found by applying a multiplier @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the normal distribution standard score for cumulative probability @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is interpreted as meaning that an observer , exposed many times to a threshold target under the conditions of the experiment , would be expected to respond correctly on 50 per cent of occasions .",
    "it does not mean that during a single observation the target should be visible for 50 per cent of the time , as suggested by @xcite : an observer able to see the target for any period of time during every exposure would be expected to achieve a success rate of 100 per cent ( assuming no mistaken responses or false positives ) .",
    "nor does it mean that the observer would be 50 per cent confident of having seen the target , as supposed by @xcite .",
    "blackwell reported that , in general , observers were confident of having seen the target only in cases where the resulting detection probability was 90 per cent or greater , corresponding to @xmath14 , suggesting that thresholds should be multiplied by at least this much to give realistic values .",
    "@xcite noted that subjects in forced - choice experiments could show a detection rate slightly better than chance , even when not consciously aware of having seen the target .",
    "higher ( poorer ) thresholds are found if observers instead adjust the brightness until the target becomes just visible . in order to raise forced - choice thresholds to what they termed ` common - sense seeing ' , blackwell & blackwell proposed a multiplier 2.4 .",
    "the application of an overall multiplier to laboratory data will here be termed ` laboratory scaling ' , and can be used as a way of comparing data from studies performed under different experimental conditions .",
    "blackwell s data were extended to larger target sizes in @xcite and @xcite , and to all observer ages by @xcite .",
    "threshold was found to rise with increasing age : slowly up to about 45 , then quite rapidly .",
    "this is due mainly to loss of transparency in the ocular media ( adrian 1989 ) rather than diminution of pupil size , as assumed by @xcite .",
    "however it was found that to a very good approximation the shape of the threshold curve ( on log axes ) remained invariant , i.e. the effect of age is to introduce a further overall multiplier , in addition to laboratory scaling .",
    "empirically determined age multipliers in @xcite range from 1 for 50 per cent of 20-year - olds , to 6.92 to include 95 per cent of 65-year - olds .",
    "the age multiplier is an example of a ` field factor ' @xcite constituting a departure from the laboratory conditions .",
    "more generally these may be associated with the target ( e.g. non - circular shape , non - uniformity ) , viewing conditions ( non - uniform background , glare sources ) and observer ( motivation , fatigue ) .",
    "the field factors contribute further multipliers to the contrast threshold .",
    "there may also be physical effects which objectively alter the stimulus , such as magnification or light loss in a telescope , needing to be taken into account as @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "hence in practice the threshold function is @xmath17 where @xmath18 - the product of all field factors and any laboratory scaling - has the effect of shifting the whole curve up or down on log axes .",
    "thus the threshold function should in general be considered relative rather than absolute @xcite , but invariant in shape , implying a correlation between threshold at large and small target sizes ( i.e. , in astronomy , an equivalence between limiting stellar magnitude and limiting surface brightness ) .",
    "this suggests two approaches to visibility modelling .",
    "one ( here called ` enumeration ' ) is to attempt to quantify all the relevant field factors from physical data ( or estimate them ) and hence determine @xmath18 for a given observing situation .",
    "the other ( ` elimination ' ) is to leave @xmath18 as an unknown variable , unless data are available that allow it to be determined , or calculations can be performed where it cancels out .",
    "@xcite studied stellar visibility using enumeration , whereas the present article will treat targets of arbitrary size using elimination .",
    "schaefer assumed that the personal factor of the observer ( which he denoted @xmath19 ) was approximately 1 , but that the detection probability could vary , whereas actually the latter is a fixed normalisation constant and the personal factor may vary considerably between individuals .",
    "the error was mathematically insignificant since the threshold is multiplied by the product of these factors .",
    "luminance can be defined as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the spectral radiance ( e.g. planck s equation if the source is a black body ) and @xmath22 is a sensitivity function ( of finite support ) with associated normalisation constant @xmath23 .",
    "examples of @xmath22 are the international commission on illumination ( cie ) 1924 photopic luminous efficiency function for a 2-degree field ( here denoted @xmath24 , with @xmath25 lm / w ) and the cie 1951 scotopic function , @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 lm / w ) , both tabulated in @xcite .",
    "one could also choose the normalised passbands of the johnson - morgan system ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , tabulated in @xcite .",
    "apparent @xmath22-magnitude can be defined differentially for targets of equal area as @xmath31 luminance in cd m^-2^ is conventionally defined using @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ luminance ] , whereas magnitude in @xmath32 is defined using @xmath30 in eq .",
    "[ magnitude ] . also of importance in light - pollution studies is the sensitivity function of the unihedron sky quality meter , @xmath33 .",
    "the similarity of these three sensitivity functions makes them effectively equivalent for most practical purposes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the @xmath22-magnitude scale has zero - point @xmath34 lx then @xmath35 lx is equivalent to apparent magnitude @xmath36 , and @xmath1 cd m^-2^ is equivalent to surface brightness @xmath37arcsec^-2^. taking @xmath38 lx @xcite gives conversion formulae @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "henceforth magnitude can be assumed to be @xmath41-band unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the darkest skies on earth have a zenith luminance of approximately 22 mag arcsec^-2^ ( @xmath42 cd m^-2^ ) , with the visible sky background on a clear moonless night being a combination ( in descending order ) of natural airglow , zodiacal light and unresolved starlight @xcite .",
    "airglow typically accounts for about 60 per cent of zenith sky luminance @xcite , varying with solar activity , and dominated by the 557.7 nm oi emission line which alone typically contributes around 20 per cent of total @xmath41-band sky brightness @xcite . at urban sites",
    "the sky spectrum is dominated by tropospheric scattering of anthropogenic light ; measurements by @xcite near vienna showed very large peaks at 546 nm and 611 nm ( attributable to fluorescent street lamps ) with smaller intervening peaks due to high - pressure sodium lamps .",
    "zenith sky brightness was in the range 15 - 19.25 @xmath43 ( approximately @xmath44 to @xmath45 cd m^-2^ ) .",
    "as a general approximation one can take @xmath46 cd m^-2^ ( 21.83 mag arcsec^-2^ ) as representative of a truly dark sky , though at a pristine site there may be regions of the sky that are darker than this @xcite .",
    "human vision at normal light levels is photopic , utilising the trichromatic cone cells whose density is greatest in the foveal region of the retina . in very low light levels vision",
    "is scotopic , utilising the monochromatic rod cells whose density is greatest outside the fovea .",
    "there was formerly thought to be an abrupt switch between the two types of vision , though in fact there is a continuous transition at intermediate ( mesopic ) light levels as cone response lessens and rods become active .",
    "hence it is misleading to speak of ` day ' and ` night ' vision .",
    "the transition is dependent on the particular visual task and prevailing conditions , so can not be specified exactly , but as a working definition one can take the range of mesopic vision as 0.005 to 5 cd m^-2^ @xcite , i.e. scotopic vision operates in conditions darker than about 18.3 mag arcsec^-2^. for astronomical purposes , @xcite estimated the limit as 18.9 @xmath43 ( approximately 0.003 cd m^-2^ ) .",
    "vision has ` channels ' for luminance and chromaticity ; contrast can be defined with respect to either , but in scotopic vision only the luminance channel operates .",
    "if an observer is able to detect colour then this indicates cone activity , so nocturnal astronomical observation often involves mesopic rather than scotopic vision .",
    "variable star observers generally restrict magnitude estimates to stars at least two magnitudes brighter than threshold , using direct rather than averted vision , which gives more reliable estimates since it minimises rod contribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite found from a survey of experienced observers that in telescopic stellar viewing , scotopic vision operates at no more than about one magnitude above threshold .",
    "mesopic photometry would be important for a proper treatment of supra - threshold magnitude estimates or visibility under severe light pollution ( including twilight ) .",
    "however this article is concerned with threshold rather than brightness perception ; and although the model will cover achromatic vision across the entire luminance range , the astronomical applications will be restricted to scotopic vision , i.e. targets within about one magnitude of threshold against a background no brighter than about @xmath47 cd m^-2^ ( 18.9 mag arcsec^-2^ ) , to which the observer is assumed fully adapted .",
    "since photometric units are usually defined by photopic sensitivity , one might query the validity of low - level contrast thresholds measured in this way . however , suppose the background and target have the same relative spectral radiance , i.e. @xmath21 , @xmath48 respectively ( as in blackwell s experiment ) , with the background having luminance @xmath1 given by eq .",

    "two sources could be measured as having equal ( photopic ) luminance , but one with lower s / p ratio will have less output ( appear dimmer ) at scotopic levels .",

    "the spectral radiance of the sky is variable : at a given site there will , for example , be temporal changes in airglow , variation of tropospheric scattering with zenith distance , and variation of zodiacal light with ecliptic latitude .",
    "zodiacal light is scattered sunlight , and its spectrum is almost identical to the sun s at visible wavelengths ( fig .",

    "this is very close to the s / p ratio of blackwell s light sources ( 1.41 , equivalent to 58 per cent airglow ) .",

    "thresholds were presented as equivalent increments ( @xmath8 ) for an opaque target . to compare the results with the point - source thresholds of @xcite , the latter s scotopic luminance values ( for background and increment ) must be multiplied by 1.220 because of the differing colour temperatures , and a further overall multiplier , @xmath122 , must be applied to the increments because the method of adjustment yields higher thresholds than forced - choice with 50 per cent detection probability .",

    "astronomical observations are often enhanced by long viewing times ; @xcite cited omeara s visual recovery of halley s comet after 1 to 2 hours , claiming it demonstrated a long - term integration property of the visual system . however saccades limit fixation time to no more than about a second , comparable with the maximum integration time of retinal cells .",
    "@xcite measured the shortest viewing times such that telescopic targets appeared undimmed compared with unlimited exposure , using the 0.61 m telescope at mauna kea , and found times of 1.03 s or less .",
    "confusion over blackwell s definition of detection probability has led to an incorrect assumption that it is related to exposure time @xcite , however laboratory experiments have shown that long viewing times generally degrade rather than enhance performance @xcite .",
    "the benefit in astronomy can be explained by atmospheric variability ; planetary observers are familiar with moments of best seeing , but what is less generally appreciated are fluctuations of transparency .",
    "air turbulence creates variations of refractive index manifested in seeing ( image motion caused by tilting of wave - fronts ) and scintillation ( brightness variation caused by curved wave fronts focusing or defocusing starlight ) @xcite .",
    "the two effects are distinct , with major contributions from different atmospheric altitudes , and have little or no correlation , though aperture - dependency leads to an apparent correlation for naked - eye viewing , i.e. more noticeable scintillation on nights of poor seeing .",
    "a site with excellent seeing can nevertheless have high scintillation .    as will be explained in section 2 , at scotopic levels point sources are indistinguishable from extended targets up to about 10 arcmin in diameter .",
    "hence seeing is important for high - magnification telescopic viewing , but has no effect on naked - eye viewing .",
    "scintillation , on the other hand , has greatest effect for naked - eye viewing , and is of potential significance for threshold determinations with or without optical aid .",
    "scintillation occurs on multiple temporal scales , at all zenith angles , and can lead to sudden ` flashes ' with a brightening of 1 to 2 mag lasting a hundredth of a second , or lesser increase for longer @xcite .",
    "the visibility of brief flashes is dependent on their energy in relation to threshold @xcite ; specific cases would require detailed calculation , but it can be seen that the general effect is that a very faint star may only be seen momentarily during many minutes of observation , and there may on occasion be a sighting of a star considerably fainter than the usual limit .",
    "scintillation alters the colour of stars @xcite and has a differential effect on point versus extended sources @xcite .",
    "the effect of scintillation is averaged out by long integration times and large apertures , but human vision has a very short integration time and ( for naked - eye viewing ) a very small aperture , so that variations are potentially large .",
    "the phenomenon is caused by high altitude winds , so proximity to a main jet stream is expected to lead to higher scintillation : @xcite noted the high rates measured at mauna kea and paranal , and suggested that there would in general be greater scintillation along latitudes @xmath137 degrees , and minima at the equator and poles .",
    "the effect of seeing on telescopic views is dependent on aperture .",
    "the fried parameter @xmath138 is the critical diameter above which resolving power is limited by the atmosphere rather than by the telescope s own diffraction @xcite . in a sufficiently large telescope ,",
    "a star produces a blurred disc of speckles ( each of which is an airy disc ) with an approximately gaussian profile .",
    "it is customary to quote the seeing @xmath139 as the disc s full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , though the actual image is larger . since fwhm = @xmath140 for a gaussian standard deviation @xmath10 , and",
    "since @xmath141 will contain 97 per cent of the light of a gaussian disc , one could take the actual width of the seeing disc as approximately @xmath142 . to contain 100 per cent",
    "one could take @xmath143 , i.e. @xmath144 . @xcite assumed the disc diameter to be equal to the quoted seeing ( in his eq .",
    "7 ) , which may be true for small telescopes depending on how the seeing has been assessed by the observer . @xcite",
    "made the same assumption in his model , but applied it to large telescopes .",
    "zenith angle is a determinant of atmospheric extinction and sky brightness ( eqs . 3 and 19 of @xcite ) , as well as atmospheric reddening and scintillation .",
    "in the method of enumeration one requires absolute values for these , whereas for elimination it is sufficient to require that observations are all made under sufficiently equivalent conditions .",
    "air mass affects point and extended sources slighty differently ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and this would need to be taken into account if the most precise results were required , but will not be done here .",
    "it has been shown that blackwell s experiment at scotopic levels can be considered a good representation of 2850 k black - body sources against a sky with typical airglow and neligible light pollution .",
    "targets with a spectral radiance very different from black - body ( e.g. emission nebulae ) , or heavily light - polluted sky backgrounds , would require special treatment using the techniques of section [ photometry ] .",
    "if the concern is with finding limiting magnitude by the method of elimination , it is sufficient to assume that stars are all of approximately the same colour index ( as was done by @xcite and @xcite ) , though not necessarily a specific value . for stars of specific colour index eq .",
    "[ blackwellcorr ] should be used .",
    "threshold for rectangular targets was investigated by @xcite who showed that area is a sufficient determinant for aspect ratios up to approximately 7 .",
    "hence the model should be adequate for elliptical targets with apparent eccentricity up to about this figure .",
    "non - uniform targets will be treated approximately : it will be shown that realistic predictions can be made regarding the visibility of galaxies or the seeing discs of stars .",
    "the sky itself can be considered uniform in the immediate vicinity of a target , but field stars potentially introduce glare sources , such that a faint target may be invisible because of a brighter star in the vicinity .",
    "this glare effect can be treated in a standard way @xcite but specific problems of this type will not be considered here .",
    "light loss in a telescope introduces a differential effect with respect to naked - eye viewing , and constitutes a stimulus modification .",
    "@xcite assumed transmittance values according to telescope type , but it will be seen that if multiple observations are recorded under suitably controlled conditions ( as was done by @xcite ) then the transmittance ( denoted @xmath145 ) can be deduced by elimination .",
    "monocular vision through a telescope introduces another differential effect , though this is a modification of threshold rather than stimulus .",
    "@xcite measured contrast thresholds with left ( @xmath146 ) , right ( @xmath147 ) and both eyes ( @xmath5 ) , finding the approximate relation @xmath148 ) .",
    "theoretical considerations suggested that the factor on the left should be @xmath149 , and if threshold is equal in both eyes then this means the monocular threshold is @xmath149 times the binocular value .",
    "this is the factor that was assumed by @xcite ( his @xmath150 ) , though it was included incorrectly as a stimulus modification in his eq .",
    "15 ( i.e. as a multiplier of @xmath1 ) , and this was repeated by @xcite .",
    "magnification produces an increase of target area and also in most cases reduction of retinal illumination , because the observer effectively views through an artificial pupil ( i.e. the exit pupil of the instrument , which is usually smaller than the eye pupil ) . in some cases the stiles - crawford effect may need to be considered ( i.e. the reduction in luminous efficiency of rays entering the eye obliquely )",
    "this is significant for photopic ( and mesopic ) vision , being attributable to directional sensitivity of cone cells , but @xcite found little or no directional sensitivity in rod cells , while @xcite found a very small effect , but only for rays entering at the periphery of pupils larger than about 5 mm .",
    "hence they stated that the usual equation for the photopic effect could not be applied , though @xcite proposed such an expression ( his eq .",
    "9 ) which incorrectly gives a non - zero value for all pupil sizes . in the present article the effect will be considered negligible .",
    "telescope use potentially introduces other differential factors relative to naked - eye viewing .",
    "observers may be apt to use near rather than infinite eye focus when looking through an eyepiece , which may alter the effect of any ocular aberration .",
    "the telescope itself may suffer from aberration , and will show the viewer a much smaller apparent area of sky , set within a darker surround",
    ". there may be a difference of search procedure between naked - eye and telescopic viewing ( e.g. finding known stars to assess naked - eye limit , then searching for hitherto unknown ones to assess telescopic limit ) .",
    "if the telescope is undriven then motion may be a factor . these will be assumed part of an overall telescopic field factor whose components can be split into magnification dependent ( @xmath151 ) or independent ( @xmath152 ) terms . if an approximate value is needed , it will be assumed that @xmath153 , i.e. the only significant magnification - independent factor is the correction for monocular vision .",
    "@xmath151 can be considered to be unity at low magnification in the absence of the stiles - crawford effect , but contributions could come from the use of interchangeable eyepieces of differing specification and quality , and at high magnification the point spread function of the eye will be significant @xcite , with an exit pupil of 0.5 mm usually being regarded as the limit below which diffraction in the eye begins to dominate @xcite .",
    "this imposes a maximum useful magnification @xcite , apart from the limitations imposed by seeing . in practice",
    "it should be sufficient to assume @xmath154 up to some magnification beyond which there is no further improvement in threshold .",
    "the activities of amateur astronomers can lie anywhere between science and recreational sport . if the latter , then the individual s concern with limiting magnitude may be to maximise it , whereas for science a main interest should be consistency of measurement .",
    "scintillation in particular is a potential bonus from the recreational point of view , though a source of noise for science .",
    "threshold can be boosted in various ways : @xcite observed stars through a hole in a black screen ( i.e. against a totally dark background ) and in this way was able to see one of magnitude 8.3 , and possibly one of magnitude 8.9 , though his limit for stars seen against the sky was 6.5 .",
    "flickering is known to improve threshold @xcite : a rapidly operating shutter ( e.g. a fan ) adjusted to the optimum frequency of around 6 hz , and placed in the line of sight ( e.g. within a telescope ) , would produce some gain of magnitude .",
    "@xcite found that hyperventilation helped , consistent with the findings of @xcite , though excessive oxygen is damaging to the retina @xcite .",
    "it has always been appreciated that the traditional naked - eye magnitude limit of 6 is merely approximate .",
    "@xcite commented on the magnitude limits of nineteenth - century naked - eye star catalogues , which ranged from 5.7 ( argelander ) to 6.7 ( heis ) .",
    "the latter observer was renowned for his visual acuity , and his _ atlas coelestis _ is unusual in including the galaxy m33 as a naked - eye object @xcite .",
    "gould s _ uranometria argentina _ had a stated magnitude limit of 7 but modern photometry has shown the actual limit to be 6.5 @xcite . as an example of exceptional eyesight , weaver cited meesters ability to see stars to 6.9 mag .",
    "weaver s study upheld a value of just over 6 for the typical dark - sky naked - eye limit , yet more recently there has been a substantial raising of achievement and expectation .",
    "the bortle scale @xcite suggests that for a class 1 ( ` excellent ' ) site the limiting magnitude should be ` 7.6 to 8.0 ( with effort ) ' and for class 2 ( ` typical truly dark site ' ) 7.1 to 7.5 .",
    "@xcite reported omeara s extraordinary ability to see stars as faint as 8.4 mag against the sky .",
    "apart from unusual acuity or special observing techniques , such high limits may in many cases be explained by scintillation , with momentary glimpses being taken as typical threshold .",
    "subjective estimates may not always be reliable or accurate ; the survey by @xcite yielded many responses ( about half of the total ) in which naked - eye limit was given only to the nearest whole number .",
    "it is a matter of policy judgment whether visibility recommendations for the general public should be based on typical or extreme performance . for modelling ,",
    "one requires a definition that most closely resembles the conditions of the laboratory data ( blackwell s experiment ) and is not unduly sensitive to local effects or false positives .",
    "probably the best way to achieve this in practice is the method of star counting , using designated areas close to zenith .",
    "stars should be continuously visible ( with direct or averted vision ) for some extended period ( seconds ) rather than be seen to flash momentarily",
    ". the observer should be fully dark - adapted , with screening from terrestrial glare if necessary , and with a naked - eye view of the sky that is at least as large as a typical apparent field of view in a telescope ( e.g. 50 degrees ) . for telescopic views the use of magnitude sequences ( as described by @xcite )",

    "others could have been missed because of low declination , crowded search fields , proximity to glare sources ( bright stars ) , limited search time or human error . in general , however , it can be seen that the missed objects are smaller and nearer threshold than the discovered ones .",
    "this can be quantified using ` visibility level ' , defined as the ratio of an object s contrast to the threshold level @xcite , for which the corresponding astronomical quantity is the object s distance ( @xmath394 ) below the curve . for the objects in fig .",

    "missed objects with @xmath266 and @xmath394 larger than the mean values for discovered ones , and which therefore should have been easy targets for herschel , amount to only 3.6 per cent of those he did not see , illustrating the thoroughness of his search .    .",

    "the contrast of an extended object seen in a telescope is independent of magnification , but the threshold is dependent on image size and background , both of which change with magnification . hence an object may be invisible at low or high power but visible in some intermediate range .",

    "[ clark ] which shows threshold curves for a 100 mm telescope at magnifications 20 , 75 and 200 ( with parameters chosen for convenience of illustration ) , and a single data point representing a hypothetical non - stellar object . raising power shifts the ricco asymptote to the left ( increasing the point - source limit ) but lowers the horizontal asymptote ( decreasing the surface - brightness limit ) .",
    "the object is predicted to be visible at magnification 75 but not at the lower and higher powers .",
    "the model could be used to obtain optimum magnifications for actual objects , but such predictions are of limited value , both because of the lack of appropriate data at the correct isophotal limit , and ( most importantly ) because targets are in general not uniform .",
    "it is however interesting to note the finding of @xcite that at low light levels visual acuity is greatest for a pupil size of approximately 3 mm .",

    "the instruments are @xmath401 binoculars and a 6-inch refractor ( @xmath402 mm ) at the dark site , and a 16-inch reflector with 25 per cent central obstruction ( @xmath403 mm ) at the light - polluted one , with assumed transmittances 85 , 95 and 75 per cent respectively .",
    "both telescopes have exit pupil 3 mm .",
    "data are also plotted for the 16 messier galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite , subject to the usual caveats regarding isophotal limit and non - uniformity , but providing a reasonably homogeneous sample for illustrative purposes .",
    "it can be seen that for any target larger than 1 arcmin^2^ the 16-inch is outperformed by the smaller telescope at the darker site : light pollution renders it ineffective for viewing galaxies .",
    "binoculars outperform the 6-inch for very large , low surface - brightness objects ; however the 6-inch will show numerous smaller targets . since the effect of varying the field factor",

    "a new way has been presented for modelling achromatic threshold visibility data such as that of @xcite or @xcite , and has been shown to represent the laboratory data more accurately than previous models . for applications at low light levels",
    "a photometric correction is needed ; this has been calculated for scotopic vision , applicable to astronomical observations within approximately one magnitude of threshold at sites without excessive light pollution .",
    "the new point - source model matches the data of @xcite more accurately than previous atempts by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model for extended targets offers new insights into the visibility of ` deep sky objects ' such as galaxies , and has been shown to be consistent with the observations of william herschel .",
    "the basic relation of the model , shown in figures [ rbtable8 ] and [ cinf ] , was purely empirical , but one might question whether it has a physiological basis .",
    "[ rscot ] implies @xmath404 , the de vries rose law @xcite , so the relation models the departure of the visual system from ideal quantum detection , which is presumed to arise at the stage of post - retinal processing . because the visual system is quite different from a detector limited only by quantum efficiency , the results presented here are not expected to be applicable to ccd imaging .",
    "however , since a similar threshold curve is obtained for targets identified visually from photographic plates @xcite , one would expect applicability there .",
    "any line of constant magnitude brighter than the ricco asymptote will intersect the threshold curve , demarcating zones that are visible or otherwise .",
    "hence the completeness of any magnitude - limited sample is dictated by the shape of the curve together with the luminosity function for the targets in question .",
    "this should apply for example to the catalogue of @xcite , for which an empirical completeness function was found by @xcite .",
    "the photopic model of section 2 would be applicable to daylight phenomena such as sunspots , though visibility of objects against the blue sky would require proper incorporation of chromaticity",
    ". this would also be the case for mesopic applications , e.g. observation at heavily light polluted sites where colour can be perceived .",
    "successful modelling of situations such as these would require new experimental data sets , other than the achromatic ones used here . at light polluted sites where scotopic vision is possible ( i.e. darker than about 19 mag arcsec^-2^ )",
    ", the sky spectrum will have anthropogenic contributions for which a photometric correction is necessary , as shown in section 1.3 .",
    "photometers are available which measure both photopic and scotopic luminance",
    ". this would be useful in light pollution studies since s / p ratio varies with type of lighting : a moonlit country sky and a moonless suburban one polluted by fluorescent lighting could both give the same reading on a sky quality meter ( e.g. 20 @xmath43 , or ` sq 20 ' ) , but the country sky would be darker to scotopic vision since the s / p ratio of fluorescent lighting is higher than that of moonlight .",
    "if the meter were fitted with a removable scotopic filter and suitably calibrated then s / p ratios could be found and quoted in addition to photopic luminance .",
    "the international dark - sky association @xcite currently recognizes three classes of dark sky : bronze ( sq @xmath405 ) , silver ( sq @xmath406 ) and gold ( sq @xmath407 21.75 ) .",
    "a reading greater than 22 is ` unlikely to be recorded ' @xcite .",
    "the suggested limiting magnitudes ( based on the bortle scale ) are bronze : @xmath408 , silver : @xmath409 , gold : @xmath407 6.8 .",
    "it is questionable whether 20 mag arcsec^-2^ can be considered dark , given the results shown in fig .",
    "[ comparo ] .",
    "also it has been argued here that a definition of naked - eye limiting magnitude based on momentary glimpses is overly susceptible to scintillation , which is a local and variable effect .",
    "consequently it has been suggested that currently recommended magnitude limits may be excessive , compared with limits that would be obtained for targets visible for an extended period .",
    "it has also been shown that the recommendations of the bortle scale with regard to the visibility of m33 are contradicted by the present model .",
    "since the scale appears to be based on subjective judgment rather than rigorous data , its reliability appears questionable .",
    "a practical definition of a dark sky would be one in which the milky way is capable of being seen .",
    "the non - uniformity of the milky way makes this problematic to model , and even if a particular region were chosen as standard , there remains the problem that existing luminance measurements are based on a surface brightness limit fainter than that of the eye , and are usually filtered to remove bright stars , whereas unresolved stars just beyond the visual limit may contribute a significant proportion of the light detectable by eye .",
    "an equivalent limiting magnitude could be found empirically : observers would view the sky through a variable filter , adjusting it until a chosen portion of the milky way was considered just visible , and they would also note the faintest stars visible at this setting .",
    "@xcite noted that the summer milky way became visible from paris observatory when the sun reached 13 degrees below horizon .",
    "the corresponding sky brightness is dependent on local conditions but would have been approximately @xmath410 mag arcsec^-2^ @xcite .",
    "bigourdan further noted that with the sun 15 degrees below horizon he was able to see faint ngc objects , while an angle of 16 degrees was sufficient for the faintest to become visible .",
    "that would indicate approximate values of 21.3 and 21.5 mag arcsec^-2^. that suggests a three - tier dark - sky classification with proportionally diminishing sq bands @xmath411 ( ` grey ' ) , @xmath412 ( ` black ' ) and @xmath413 ( ` pristine ' ) . recalling from section 1.3",
    "the @xcite suggested limit for scotopic vision , one could add a ` bright ' band sq @xmath414 , and a ` white ' band sq @xmath415 , in which scotopic vision would not be achievable for naked - eye sky observation .    .magnitude",
    "penalty @xmath416 and surface brightness supplement @xmath417 with respect to ideal conditions ( @xmath418 mag arcsec^-2^ ) , with approximate sky - quality banding .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the threshold curve is relative rather than absolute , and it has been shown that for a given observing situation there is an overall field factor @xmath18 which can often be eliminated from calculations .",
    "suppose that for a given individual under particular observing conditions at an ideal site ( @xmath418 mag arcsec^-2^ ) the naked - eye limit is @xmath419 , and that at a site with greater sky brightness but otherwise equivalent observing conditions the same person s limit is @xmath242 .",
    "then the ` penalty ' @xmath420 ( calculated using eq .",
    "[ deltai ] ) is independent of @xmath18 , and hence of observer . the difference @xmath421 ( from eq .",
    "[ sblim ] ) is likewise independent of @xmath18 , i.e. the limiting surface brightness can be expressed as a ` supplement ' to be added to an individual s point - source limit for a given site .",
    "this is shown in table [ limits ] , together with corresponding banding .",
    "for example , a person whose limit is 6.0 mag at a ` grey ' site with @xmath422 mag arcsec^-2^ ( which would correspond to @xmath18 = 1.74 ) is predicted to have limiting surface brightness 23.74 mag arcsec^-2^ at that site . at a ` pristine ' site with @xmath423 mag arcsec^-2^ that same person is predicted to have limits 6.3 mag and 24.28 mag arcsec^-2^. good linear approximations for naked - eye stellar limits ( error @xmath424 mag ) are :    @xmath425    @xmath426",
