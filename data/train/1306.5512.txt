    "in the vacuum of quantum electromagnetic dynamics ( qed ) , virtual electron and positron pairs are created and annihilated , momentarily and continuously .",
    "the pairs can be materialized in a strong electric field .",
    "this is a non - perturbative phenomenon and is known as the schwinger effect @xcite ( for related progress see @xcite ) .",
    "this is not intrinsic to the original qed but ubiquitous in quantum field theories coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field . in all cases ,",
    "we refer it as to the schwinger effect for convenience sake .",
    "it is interesting to consider the schwinger effect in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "first , we have to realize a system coupled with a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "it can be realized basically via the higgs mechanism with the breaking of the gauge group from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "then the fundamental scalar fields , which belong to the w - boson supermultiplet and are often called `` w - bosons '' or `` quarks '' , are coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field as well as an @xmath3 one ( we will call them w - bosons hereafter ) .",
    "the coulomb potential between them is also computed in the holographic setup @xcite .",
    "hence we can consider the pair production rate of the w - bosons via the schwinger effect @xcite .    in the setup proposed by semenoff and zarembo @xcite",
    ", the probe d3-brane is located far from the boundary so as to make the mass of w - bosons lighter , rather than infinitely heavy . the exponential factor in the production rate of w - bosons",
    "is evaluated from the string world - sheet attaching to the probe d3-brane .",
    "the string solution is obtained by terminating the one for a circular wilson loop @xcite at the location of the probe d3-brane .",
    "then the value of a critical electric field , for which the potential barrier vanishes , agrees with the one obtained from the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action .",
    "this is compatible with the stringy schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "the setup in @xcite has been generalized to the pair production of monopole - antimonopole pairs and dyon - antidyon pairs @xcite and the case with magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the same result on the critical electric field has also been reproduced from the potential analysis @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that we do not have to take account of fluctuations around a circular wilson loop ( for attempts to evaluate the fluctuations around a circular wilson loop , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the results in @xcite give a strong support for the proposal of semenoff and zarembo from another perspective .",
    "in this letter we will apply the potential analysis to confining theories with a holographic setup .",
    "although there are various confining backgrounds , we will focus upon here 1 ) d3-brane and 2 ) d4-brane backgrounds , where one of spatial directions is compactified on an s@xmath4 circle with the ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions for bosons ( fermions ) @xcite .",
    "for both cases , the total potential has two critical values of the electric field .",
    "the first is the same as the one in the coulomb phase .",
    "the potential barrier vanishes at the critical value and the vacuum becomes unstable catastrophically .",
    "the second one is intrinsic to the confining phase .",
    "the critical value of the electric field agrees with the confining string tension . below this value",
    ", the potential tends to diverge at infinitely long distances and thus no schwinger effect occurs . when the electric field dominates the confining string tension , the potential vanishes at infinity and hence the schwinger effect can occur as a tunneling process .",
    "let us perform the potential analysis for the confining d3-brane background .",
    "the background metric in the lorentzian signature is given by @xcite @xmath5 where the ten - dimensional spacetime coordinates are described by @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the line element of s@xmath8 with the unit radius .",
    "the ads radius @xmath9 is related to the gauge - theory parameter as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 :  t  hooft coupling ) .",
    "note that the metric ( [ metric ] ) contains the scalar function @xmath12 here @xmath13 is interpreted as the inverse compactification radius in the @xmath14-direction . as @xmath15 grows , the radius tends to shrink .",
    "also , @xmath15 plays the role like `` temperature '' . when @xmath16 ( zero temperature ) , the usual ads@xmath17 background is reproduced .",
    "we are concerned with the classical solution of the fundamental string on the background ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "we will work in the euclidean signature after performing a wick rotation to the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the nambu - goto ( ng ) string action is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the string tension and the string world - sheet coordinates are described by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we work with the static gauge @xmath22 and suppose the ansatz for the radial direction , @xmath23 then the ansatz leads to the following expression , @xmath24 the analysis below is almost parallel to the one in @xcite . now",
    "that @xmath25 does not depend on @xmath21 explicitly , one can obtain the conserved quantity , @xmath26 by imposing the boundary condition at @xmath27 , @xmath28 the conserved quantity is written as @xmath29 equation can be rewritten as @xmath30 the configuration we consider is depicted in fig.[ads - soliton : fig ] .",
    "it would be worth noting the relation between the present configuration and the previous one discussed in @xcite . in the previous analysis @xcite ,",
    "a temporal wilson loop is considered with the ( euclidean ) black three - brane background @xcite , while now a temporal wilson loop is discussed in the confining background ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "when we consider a spatial wilson loop in the ( euclidean ) black three - brane background , the analysis completely agrees with the present one .    ]    by solving the differential equation ( [ diff ] ) under the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) , the distance @xmath31 between w - boson and anti w - boson is obtained as @xmath32 where the following dimensionless quantities have been introduced , @xmath33 by putting ( [ diff ] ) into ( [ l ] ) and removing the derivative of @xmath34 , the classical action is evaluated .",
    "then the potential energy ( pe ) between the w - bosons including the static energy ( se ) is obtained as @xmath35    let us here comment on the @xmath36 limit ( which corresponds to @xmath37 ) .",
    "then the potential is given by @xmath38 the first term represents a linear potential and the string tension @xmath39 ( not confusing with the string tension @xmath40 ) is given by @xmath41 and the well known result is reproduced .",
    "the second term is rewritten as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the w - boson mass .",
    "hence it can be understood as the static energy of a pair of w - bosons .",
    "thus the total potential energy @xmath44 , including the energy of the external electric field , is given by case , the same potential with a specific value of the electric field is discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath45 where we have introduced the following quantities , @xmath46 here @xmath47 corresponds to the critical electric field obtained from the dbi action . note that @xmath47 is not modified even after the compactification , because the electric field is turned on the @xmath48-direction while the @xmath14-direction is compactified .",
    "one can see the shape of the total potential numerically .",

    "the potential behavior for the values of @xmath55 is the same as in the coulomb phase @xcite .",
    "the finiteness at the origin is quite similar to the one in non - linear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "a remarkable point intrinsic to the confining phase is that the potential becomes flat as @xmath56 when @xmath57 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "the string tension of confining strings is balanced with the electric field and thus the potential becomes flat .",
    "below @xmath57 , there is no zero in the potential other than the origin .",
    "this means that the confining string tension dominates the electric field and no schwinger effect occurs .     and @xmath59 .",
    "the blue line is for @xmath50 .",
    "there is no zero other than the origin and hence the schwinger effect does not occur .",
    "the red line is for @xmath57 .",
    "this values corresponds to @xmath60 and the potential becomes flat as @xmath61 . for the values of @xmath62 between @xmath51 and @xmath53",
    ", there is the potential barrier and the schwinger effect can occur as tunneling process .",
    "just for @xmath63 ( the orange line ) , the barrier vanishes and the system becomes unstable catastrophically .",
    "[ d3-plots : fig ] ]      so far , we have argued the potential shape numerically , but it is still important to evaluate the values of the critical electric fields analytically .",
    "first of all , let us consider the critical electric field above which the schwinger effect can occur .",
    "it is helpful to rewrite the total potential as follows : @xmath64 we would like to show that the potential becomes flat around @xmath56 when @xmath65 . due to the condition @xmath66 , the first term vanishes . in order to see the potential behavior around @xmath61 , we take the limit @xmath67 .",
    "then the second term becomes constant .",
    "after all , the derivative of the total potential vanishes .",
    "thus it has been shown analytically that the total potential vanishes around @xmath61 when @xmath65 .",
    "that is , when the electric field exceed @xmath68 the total potential become flat as @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath69 is regarded as the critical value above which the schwinger effect is allowed to occur as a tunneling process .",
    "next let us consider the critical electric flux above which the potential barrier vanishes .",
    "then it is convenient to rewrite the total potential as follows : @xmath70 here @xmath71 is a negative - definite and monotonically increasing function . by differentiating @xmath44 with respect to @xmath31",
    ", we obtain @xmath72 the first term in ( [ pot - der ] ) vanishes when @xmath73 .",

    "non - integral parts in both ( [ der1 ] ) and ( [ der2 ] ) diverge as @xmath77 .",
    "but the divergence is canceled out in the expression ( [ pot - der ] ) .",
    "thus the derivative of the potential ( [ pot - der ] ) vanishes around @xmath75 when @xmath73 , as we haven seen in the numerical plots .",
    "it is worth noting the relation to the previous result obtained in @xcite .",
