    "one major challenge in nonequilibrium many - body physics is to identify situations with a sufficient degree of universality , i.e.  phenomena that occur independently of a precise microscopic realization and are largely insensitive to the specific choice of initial conditions .",
    "several situations have been discussed in the literature , where many - body systems evolve in time towards nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "the most prominent example in condensed matter is certainly the electron gas exposed to a bias voltage @xcite . in this context , truly many - body properties , such as the effect of nonequilibrium conditions on quantum critical points , have been investigated @xcite .",
    "further implementations of nonequilibrium many - body systems are discussed in the context of exciton - polariton bose - einstein condensates @xcite , or more recently using driven noisy systems of trapped ions or dipolar atomic gases @xcite .",
    "as far as the time evolution of many - body systems is concerned , for closed systems we have seen a plethora of studies of quench dynamics @xcite , thermalization @xcite , and pre - thermalization @xcite , as well as transport @xcite .",
    "further dynamical studies involve situations of crossing quantum critical points in a finite time , in the spirit of the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite , or investigations of the many - body landau - zener effect @xcite .",
    "the quantum optics toolbox for the manipulation of cold atomic systems @xcite not only offers the possibility to tailor the coherent dynamics of a closed many - body system by hamiltonian engineering , but also to implement the dissipative dynamics generated by a liouville operator @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are liouville operators characterized by the existence of a unique dark state , i.e.  a sink state whereto the system is asymptotically driven , independently of the initial configuration . in this case , it has been shown theoretically that the action of the sole dissipation allows to reliably prepare the system in peculiar states with interesting quantum mechanical features , such as phase coherence in bosonic systems @xcite , entanglement in spin systems @xcite , or delocalized pairing with arbitrary symmetry in fermionic systems @xcite . since a dark state can be reached by dissipative dynamics but not left , such processes featuring a dark states clearly violate the principle of detailed balance and",
    "hence may drive the system into a steady state quite different from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the existence of a dark state with known properties nevertheless promises a sufficiently universal nonequilibrium situation with a well - defined steady state .",
    "furthermore , since dissipation needs not be a small perturbation , but on the contrary can be made the dominant contribution to the dynamics , it is natural to investigate the effects of the interplay between unitary and dissipative dynamics . in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ", the competition of two non - commuting microscopic operators leads to a phase transition if the ground states have different symmetries when one or the other operator dominates @xcite .",
    "a seminal example in the context of cold atoms in optical lattices is the superfluid - mott insulator transition in the bose - hubbard model @xcite . by analogy with equilibrium physics",
    ", one may similarly expect a phase transition in the steady state of the system , resulting from the competition of unitary and dissipative dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate a phase transition in the steady state of a driven - dissipative bosonic system on a lattice and discuss its properties in detail .",
    "we point out several features of the phase transition that make it a genuine nonequilibrium phenomenon , not fitting into the well - developed theory of equilibrium quantum phase transitions .",
    "however , we recognize some properties that may hold universally , i.e.  that may be shared by entire classes of similar systems , in the nonequilibrium steady state or in the time evolution .",
    "the profound difference between the phenomena that we consider here and the equilibrium quantum phase transition manifests itself , at a purely technical level , in the absence of a known variational principle for the steady state .",
    "the lack of such formal tool makes it necessary to evaluate the real - time evolution of the system , which is rather impractical in the many - body case .",
    "here we develop a mean field method to treat bosonic lattice systems , subject to unitary and dissipative dynamics , which generalizes the gutzwiller ansatz and allows us to describe mixed states . within this approximation scheme , we deal with an effective master equation that acts on a reduced hilbert space , is nonlinear in the quantum state , and is amenable of a workable numerical solution .",
    "moreover , we identify an analytically tractable low - density limit where the most relevant information on the quantum state is encoded in a few correlation functions , which obey coupled equations of motion . the solution of the equations of motion , which we provide for various dynamical regimes in this approximation , explains qualitatively the behavior of the system at arbitrary density .",

    "we specialize to the case that the phase difference along the @xmath18 primitive directions @xmath19 of the lattice is a constant @xmath20 .",
    "the quantum jump operators are composed of an annihilation part , which destroys a particular superposition of the bosonic wavefunction , and a creation part , which recycles the bosons after interacting with the bath .",
    "while the choice of the phase in the annihilation part is crucial to the asymptotic behavior of the system ( see below ) , the phase in the creation part is a matter of convention and could also be omitted .",
    "one possible implementation of these jump operators in optical superlattices is discussed in ref .",

    "does not have any eigenvalue on the hilbert space of @xmath35 particles , @xmath33 features a unique dissipative zero mode at the given momentum .",
    "the existence of a dark state depends here on the jump operators being not hermitian .",
    "it is important to remark , anyway , that the liouville operator conserves the total particle number @xmath36 , as the jump operators just redistribute a particle s superposition and thus fulfill @xmath37 .",
    "however , the non - hermitian nature of the jump operators entails that the dissipative process represented by the liouvillian ( [ eq : liouvillian ] ) does not respect the principle of detailed balance , because the probability that the system is projected out of the dark state is zero .",
    "the dissipative dynamics produced by the engineered liouvillian is necessarily very different from a thermalization process and hence the phase portrait of the system can not be understood in terms of a modified or perturbed equilibrium picture , but requires a genuinely new approach .",
    "an alternative physical picture of the dynamics in the presence of the dark state is the following . on two neighboring sites along the @xmath38 direction ,",
    "the component of the wave function that is not in the nullspace of @xmath39 is mapped onto the whole hilbert space , including the nullspace , while the nullspace is mapped onto itself .",
    "asymptotically , the weight of the wave function outside the nullspace vanishes and the phase of the wave function between the neighboring sites is locked to @xmath40 . since the phase locking takes place on each pair of sites , the many - body state is asymptotically projected into the bec state , i.e.  a state with long - range phase coherence .",
    "the dissipative evolution purifies the initial state of the system and , in this sense , pumping into the bec bears strong analogies to laser cooling of single atoms @xcite .",

    "we start out by considering the effect of strong interactions on the steady state of the system . in the equilibrium phase diagram of the bose - einstein hamiltonian  ( [ eq : bosehubbard ] )",
    ", the quantum phase transition between the mott insulator and the superfluid is understood in terms of the competition between the kinetic term proportional to @xmath6 , that tends to delocalize the bosons to decrease the energy , and the interaction term proportional to @xmath44 , that is responsible for an increase of the energy when particles tunnel between sites and repel each other . to understand the interplay of the energy scale in our present setup , a novel point of view is required , because the time - evolution of the system does not minimize the energy .",
    "the absence of a variational principle to characterize the steady state of the system is indeed a noteworthy difference with respect to the equilibrium theory .",

    "[ fig : exactcorr ] shows that , as the interaction strength is increased , the occupation of the zero - momentum state decreases monotonically .",
    "this is a signature , in the finite system , of the depletion of the condensate fraction that we expect in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also see that the distribution of the momenta is localized in the absence of interactions and broadens substantially for @xmath53 , analogously to the broadening of the condensate peak produced by a finite temperature .",
    "such broadening is not due to a rearrangement of the single - particle states , e.g.  the momentum states being not the appropriate eigenbasis for the system , because , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : exactentropy ] , the entropy steadily increases with the interaction strength .",
    "this means that , in the presence of interactions , the liouvillian is no longer able to drive the system towards the pure dark state .",
    "it is interesting to note that the entropy converges towards a definite constant value as the interaction strength grows , as is clear from the analysis in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : exactentropy ] .",
    "this fact suggests that the crossover exhibited by the finite system may in fact turn into a transition from the condensed state to a well - defined new phase . in the following section we validate this picture and provide a detailed analysis of the phase diagram",

    "two features of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] are dramatic manifestations of the system being out of equilibrium .",
    "first , even in the limit of vanishing dissipation the system presents a transition from a thermal - like to a condensed steady state at @xmath170 .",
    "this picture does not connect to the phase transition between the mott state and the superfluid state that characterizes the phase diagram of the equilibrium bose - hubbard system .",
    "formally , such difference is possible because the limits @xmath171 and @xmath172 do not commute and defeats the naive expectation that a small dissipation applied to a system does not wash out entirely its zero - temperature phase diagram .",
    "a more physical explanation is the fact that the engineered dissipation in the liouvillian  ( [ eq : liouvillian ] ) does not respect the principle of detailed balance , as discussed above , and hence its action is radically different from a bath that induces thermalization .",
    "a notable example of the latter case is a josephson junction array coupled to a dissipative bath @xcite , which suitably chosen can stabilize the superconducting ordered phase .",
    "the profound difference with respect to our setup stems from the fact that there the system plus bath is in global thermodynamic equilibrium and the associated phase transitions ( thermal or quantum ) are equilibrium ones .",
    "second , we note the absence of commensurability effects . at the mean field level and at zero temperature ,",
    "one expects that any mechanism suppressing superfluidity leads to a mott state for commensurate filling .",
    "in fact , given the density matrix @xmath173 without off - diagonal order ( which represents long - range order in the mean field approximation ) , the only solution for the steady state is a mott state @xmath174 with quantized particle number @xmath175 , because the conditions @xmath176 ( normalization ) and @xmath177 ( purity at zero temperature ) must hold simultaneously on each site of the lattice .",
    "in contrast , in our case the dephasing of correlations induced by the interaction ( see discussion in sec .  [",
    "ssec : competition ] ) leads to a diagonal steady state that does not obey an additional purity constraint .",
    "the dephasing of the coherent initial state makes the density matrix more and more diagonal , but does not lead to an additional localization in fock space @xcite .",
    "we also observe directly that the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] does not change qualitatively from @xmath178 to @xmath109 . in conclusion ,",
    "the nonequilibrium quantum phase transition presented here shares features of equilibrium quantum phase transitions in that it is interaction driven , and of classical phase transitions in that the ordered phase terminates in a thermal state .      in our formulation of the many - body nonequilibrium problem ,",
