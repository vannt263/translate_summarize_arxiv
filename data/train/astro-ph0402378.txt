    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are an exotic class of galactic sources that are now commonly accepted as being magnetars  isolated , young neutron stars that are powered by the decay of an ultra - high magnetic field .",
    "the evidence for high surface fields ( @xmath1  g ) comes from several independent lines of reasoning @xcite .",
    "these include : the high dipolar magnetic fields implied by the spin properties of sgrs seen in quiescence under the assumption of magnetic dipole braking @xcite ; the requirement of a magnetar - strength field to confine the energy released in the tails of hyper - eddington outbursts seen from two sgrs @xcite ; the requirement of a high field to allow the decay rate necessary to power the burst and persistent emission @xcite ; and the magnetic suppression of the thomson cross - section , which allows hyper - eddington bursts to be observed @xcite .",

    "[ these proceedings ] .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , another exotic class of galactic neutron stars , have also been suggested to be magnetars @xcite .",
    "this is because of their anomalously bright x - ray emission which can be explained neither by conventional binary accretion models nor rotation power @xcite .",
    "also , their spin parameters , as for sgrs , imply large magnetic fields under standard assumptions of magnetic braking .",
    "they also have similar , though on average softer , x - ray spectra compared with those of sgrs in quiescence .",
    "however , unlike sgrs , in the @xmath2  yr since the discovery of the first axp @xcite , none was seen to exhibit sgr - like bursts .",
    "for this reason , alternative models involving unconventional accretion scenarios have been proposed to explain axp emission @xcite .",
    "see kaspi  et  al .",
    "[ these proceedings ] for a review of axps .    ]    the magnetar model for axps was recently given a boost when sgr - like bursts were detected from two axps .",
    "@xcite reported on the discovery of two x - ray bursts in observations obtained in the direction of axp 1e  1048.15937 .",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of those bursts were similar only to those seen only in sgrs .",
    "however , the axp could not be definitely identified as the burster . on 2002",
    "june 18 , a major outburst was detected unambiguously from axp 1e  2259 + 586 , involving over 80 bursts as well as significant spectral and timing changes in the persistent emission @xcite .",
    "those bursts demonstrated that axps are capable of exhibiting behavior observed , until now , uniquely in sgrs , therefore implying a clear connection between the two source classes .",
    "such a connection was predicted only by the magnetar model @xcite .",

    "our burst searching algorithm returned 80 significant bursts from the 2002 june 18 observation .",
    "most bursts were single - peaked and had durations @xmath31  s. a small handful ( @xmath412 ) were bright and had clear fast - rise , exponential decay morphology .",
    "four bursts were multi - peaked .",
    "some bursts ( @xmath45@xmath5 ) were approximately symmetric , a few ( @xmath43@xmath5 ) fell faster than they rose while most fell slower than they rose .",
    "we calculated the occurance in pulse phase for each burst using the time of the burst peak and the rotational ephemeris given by @xcite .",
    "comparing the burst phase distribution to the pulse profile of 1e  2259 + 586   at the time of the outburst , a correlation is seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : burst phases ] ) , where most of the bursts tend to occur when the pulsed intensity is high .",
    "we note that the two bursts seen from the axp 1e  1048.15937  @xcite were also coincident with the pulse peak , which strengthens the argument that 1e  1048.15937   was the source of those bursts .",

    "our waiting time distribution is also well modelled by a log - normal distribution with mean 46.7  s and a range of 10.5208.4  s for one standard deviation .",
    "we find no correlation between the burst energy , duration and the waiting time until the next burst , nor with the elapsed time since the previous burst .",

    "we studied the hardness ratio / fluence relationship by extracting spectra and creating response matrices separately for each burst .",
    "hardness ratios were defined as the ratio of the counts in the 1060  kev band to those in the 210  kev band as in @xcite . also following @xcite , we divided the bursts into equispaced logarithmic fluence bins and calculated a weighted average hardness ratio for each bin .",

    "[ fig : hardness ratio versus fluence ] ]",
    "the bursts we have observed for 1e  2259 + 586  are clearly similar to those seen uniquely in sgrs .",
    "as concluded by @xcite and @xcite , axps and sgrs clearly share a common nature , as has been predicted by the magnetar model .",
    "the bursts seen in the 2002 june 18 outburst of 1e  2259 + 586  are qualitatively similar to those seen in sgrs , and in many ways quantitatively similar . specifically :    * the mean burst durations are similar * the differential burst fluence spectrum is well described by a power law of index @xmath0 , similar to those seen in sgrs ( and earthquakes and solar flares ) * burst fluences are positively correlated with burst durations * the distribution of and mean waiting times are similar * the burst morphologies are generally asymmetric , with rise times usually shorter than burst durations    however , there are some interesting quantitative differences between the properties of the axp and sgr bursts .",
    "these may help shed light on the physical difference(s ) between these classes .",
    "the differences can be summarized as :    * there is a significant correlation of burst phase with pulsed intensity , unlike in sgrs * the axp bursts have a wider range of burst duration ( though this may be partly due to different analyses procedures ) * the correlation of burst fluence with duration is flatter for axps than it is for sgrs ( although when selection effects are considered , this correlation should really be seen as an upper envelope for axps and sgrs ) * the fluences for the axp bursts are generally smaller than are in observed sgr bursts * the more energetic axp bursts have the hardest spectra , whereas for sgr bursts , they have the softest spectra * under reasonable assumptions , sgrs undergo outbursts much more frequently than do axps    given the rarity of axp bursts coupled with the unique information that detection of such bursts provides , observing more outbursts is obviously desirable .",
    "continued monitoring is thus clearly warranted , and _ rxte _  with its large area and flexible scheduling is the obvious instrument of choice .",
