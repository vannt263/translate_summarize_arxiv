    "<S> in - plane angular dependent resistivity adr was measured in the non - fermi liquid regime of cecoin@xmath0 single crystals at temperatures @xmath1 k and in magnetic fields @xmath2 up to 14 t. two scaling behaviors were identified in the low - field region where resistivity shows a linear @xmath3 dependence , separated by a critical angle @xmath4 which is determined by the anisotropy of cecoin@xmath0 ; i.e. , adr depends only on the perpendicular ( parallel ) field component below ( above ) @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these scaling behaviors and other salient features of adr are consistent with d - wave density waves .    </S>",
    "<S> the recently discovered heavy fermion compound cecoin@xmath0 @xcite has generated a lot of interest , partly due to the many analogies present between this compound and the high transition temperature @xmath6 superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> like the cuprates , cecoin@xmath0 has a layered crystal structure @xcite , a quasi - two - dimensional electronic spectrum @xcite , and a superconducting phase appearing at the border of the antiferromagnetic phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nmr knight shift @xcite and heat conductivity @xcite measurements revealed even parity pairing consistent with @xmath7-wave pairing symmetry , while specific heat @xcite and electrical transport @xcite experiments have shown typical non - fermi liquid behavior and have evoked the possibility of a pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , infrared spectroscopy studies have revealed the development of a gap in the density of electronic states of cecoin@xmath0 below @xmath8 100 k @xcite . as in the case of cuprates , </S>",
    "<S> all these features suggest the existence of quantum critical phenomena @xcite . however , the fermi surface topology is much more complex than in cuprates , with multiple sheets , which implies the participation of several bands in the pairing process @xcite .    in this complex picture , </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the normal state in both systems is not trivial . until recently , </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the pseudogap ( or the non - fermi liquid ) phase present in cecoin@xmath0 has not been addressed . the giant nernst effect found in this material above @xmath6 @xcite , however , reopened the problem of the origin of the pseudogap state , not only in this compound , but also in the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been shown that the giant nernst effect in cecoin@xmath0 is consistent with unconventional density waves udw or d - wave density waves d - dw @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we present new information concerning the nature of the pseudogap of cecoin@xmath0 through angular dependent resistivity adr . </S>",
    "<S> two different scaling behaviors are revealed in this compound in the non - fermi liquid regime for applied magnetic fields less than 5 t. specifically , for angles below ( above ) a certain critical angle @xmath5 , the field component perpendicular ( parallel ) to the @xmath16-planes determines the angular - dependent dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the critical angle @xmath5 is determined by the anisotropy of the material . </S>",
    "<S> these results and the other salient features of adr measured in high applied magnetic fields are consistent with d - wave density waves with landau quantization of the quasiparticle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our findings bring further understanding of the underlying physics in the non - fermi liquid regime of this exotic compound and could also advance the understanding of the pseudogap state of the cuprates .    </S>",
    "<S> high quality single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 were grown using the flux method . </S>",
    "<S> typical sizes of the crystals are 0.5x0.5x0.1mm@xmath17 with the @xmath18-axis oriented along the smallest dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the out - of - plane @xmath19 and in - plane @xmath20 resistivities using the electrical contact configuration of the flux transformer geometry , as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependent resistivity @xmath21 was measured by rotating the single crystal from @xmath22axis to @xmath23-axis , with @xmath24 the angle between @xmath2 and the @xmath18-axis . here </S>",
    "<S> we report only in - plane resistivity results .    </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependent in - plane resistivity of cecoin@xmath0 single crystals was measured in the non - fermi liquid regime , for @xmath25 k and in magnetic fields @xmath2 up to 14 t. figure 1 is a typical contour plot of resistivity obtained from @xmath26 vs @xmath24 data measured at different fixed applied magnetic field values and at a temperature of 6 k. a similar topologic contour is obtained over the whole @xmath3 range investigated . the squares , circles , and triangles correspond to @xmath27 = 0.45 , 1 , and 2/3 , respectively , which consistent with previously report @xcite , where @xmath27 is the exponent of the power - law @xmath3 dependence of the resistivity ; i.e. , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the contour plot can be divided into three different regions based on the shape of the topologic plots and the values of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> region i is the rectangular part , for which @xmath27 = 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this region is the so - called low - field region ( @xmath29 t ) for reasons given later on . </S>",
    "<S> region ii is the elliptical part , for which @xmath27 = 0.45 and which corresponds to the region around the maximum value of the @xmath30 curves for different angles . </S>",
    "<S> region iii is a large area with @xmath27 = 2/3 , which is outside of regions i and ii at even higher fields . </S>",
    "<S> region i is more interesting since it represents the typical non - fermi liquid behavior ( for this region @xmath27 = 1 ) and displays the two scaling behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will discuss the anomalous magnetoresistivity behavior in this region in more detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the bottom inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) shows @xmath31 measured in a low magnetic field of 2 t. [ data were measured in region i. ] the resistivity decreases as @xmath24 increases from @xmath32 , reaches a minimum around @xmath33 , and then displays a peak at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the data of the top inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) were measured in a high field of 9 t. [ data were measured in region iii . ] </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity increases with increasing angle and displays a shoulder , followed by a peak at @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> in the low field region ( region i ) , a spectacular scaling of these data is achieved by plotting the resistivity as a function of the component of the applied magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath16-planes , i.e. , @xmath35 , as shown in the main panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that all the curves measured in @xmath36 t overlap for all @xmath24 values between @xmath32 and a critical angle @xmath37 , marked by the arrows , and deviate from this @xmath38 scaling at higher angles . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the critical angle is independent of temperature and applied magnetic field for the range investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> we employed a second protocol to measure resistivity , in which we kept the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath18-axis fixed and scanned the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(b ) shows the resistivity as a function of the field component parallel to the @xmath39axis ( @xmath40 ) , measured at 6 k for different orientations of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> note that all the resistivity curves scale this time with @xmath41 for @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resistivity data follow two scaling laws : @xmath43 figure 1 also clearly shows the presence of the two scaling laws in region i as evidenced by the rectangular region of the @xmath26 contours . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these two scaling behaviors indicates that below ( above ) the critical angle , the field component perpendicular ( parallel ) to the @xmath16-planes determines the in - plane dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis of the angular dependent resistivity data measured in high magnetic fields ( region iii ) has shown that the data are still dominated by the perpendicular ( parallel ) field component below ( above ) the critical angle , although the two scaling laws are no longer present .    </S>",
    "<S> next we try to understand the above shape of @xmath31 measured in both low and high fields and the relationship between the two scaling behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> we plot in the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 the resistivity measured at 6 k in scanning @xmath2 up to 14 t at the two fixed angles ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) corresponding to the two field orientations ( perpendicular and parallel , respectively , to the @xmath16-planes ) which seem to determine the physics below and above @xmath5 , respectively . for the first field orientation ( @xmath46 planes ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 increases with increasing @xmath48 , reaches a maximum around 5 t , and decreases with further increasing @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the low ( high ) field region as the field region for which @xmath49 5 t ( @xmath50 5 t ) , based on this behavior of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath47 dependence gives a qualitative explanation of the @xmath31 dependence [ shown in the two insets to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ] for @xmath51 , i.e. , at angles at which the dissipation is dominated by the perpendicular field component @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , at constant @xmath2 , the resistivity should decrease ( increase ) with increasing @xmath24 , i.e. , decreasing @xmath48 , for fields lower ( higher ) than 5 t as , indeed , shown by the bottom ( top ) inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) for @xmath51 .    for the second field orientation ( @xmath53-axis ) , the @xmath54 data of the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 show an initial increase with increasing @xmath55 followed by a tendency to saturation for @xmath55 approaching 14 t. this monotonic @xmath54 dependence explains qualitatively the increase in @xmath31 [ shown in the two insets to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ] for @xmath56 , i.e. , at angles at which the dissipation is dominated by the parallel field component @xmath57 , in both low and high field regimes . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 and @xmath54 dependences of the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 explain the non - monotonic @xmath31 dependence at low fields and the monotonic @xmath31 dependence at high fields , as shown by bottom and top inset , respectively , to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows that the two resistivity curves of its inset , @xmath47 and @xmath54 , scale for @xmath58 t if @xmath54 is replaced by @xmath59 , with @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of @xmath61 is the anisotropy of the material . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 implies that the same physics is responsible for the two scaling behaviors displayed by figs . 1 and 2 for @xmath58 t , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling relationship of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 also allows one to determine the critical angle @xmath5 below ( above ) which the resistivity data scale when plotted vs the perpendicular ( parallel ) component of the applied magnetic field ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> recall that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) gives : @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter relationship and the scaling of fig . 3 [ ( @xmath65 for @xmath66 4 t ) ] give @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath68 with @xmath69 , as determined above . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the critical angle is in excellent agreement with the @xmath70 value obtained experimentally , which proves the consistency of our analysis of the angular and field dependent data . </S>",
    "<S> so , the critical angle is given by the anisotropy of the material .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the magnetoresistivity curves for @xmath71-axis ( for which the lorentz force is maximum ) and for @xmath72-axis ( for which the lorents force is zero ) shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 implies that the spin effect , rather than the orbital effect , is responsible for the magnetoresistivity in region i. the fact that in this region the resistivity is also linear in @xmath3 , indicates that this linear @xmath3 dependence is as well a result of spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion that spin fluctuations dominate the charge transport in the non - fermi liquid regime is consistent with recent in - nqr and co - nmr experiments@xcite , which have revealed that the magnetic nature in cecoin@xmath0 is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the vecinity of the quantum critical point .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we show that all the observed features of adr of cecoin@xmath0 in the non - fermi liquid regime , when a magnetic field is rotated from @xmath22axis to @xmath73axis with @xmath24 the angle between @xmath2 and the @xmath74axis , can be consistently discribed in terms of d - wave density waves in a magnetic field . the unconventional density wave udw or d - wave density wave d - dw is a kind of density wave in which the gap function @xmath75(@xmath76 ) vanishes on the line nodes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the transition from the normal state to the udw is a metal to metal transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the udw exhibits two characteristics : angular dependent resistivity and giant nernst effect . </S>",
    "<S> a udw in the low temperature phase of @xmath77-(et)@xmath78khg(scn)@xmath79 and the metallic phase of ( tmtsf)@xmath78x with x = pf@xmath80 and reo@xmath11 has been identified through adr @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the electrical conductivity in the non - fermi liquid regime is given by : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy of all fermionic excitations ( holes and particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown below , this new formula appears to be more appropriate than the one used earlier @xcite . in the absence of a magnetic field , we assume that the quasiparticle energy spectrum is given by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 ; here @xmath86 and @xmath87 are fermi velocities in the @xmath16-plane and along the @xmath18-axis , respectively , @xmath88 is the radial wave vector within the @xmath89plane , @xmath75 is the maximum value of the d - dw energy gap @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath90 has @xmath92-wave symmetry . in the vicinity of the nodal points , it is convenient to replace @xmath93 by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is perpendicular to @xmath88 within the @xmath16 plane and @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> . then in a magnetic field which makes an angle @xmath24 with the @xmath74axis , the energy spectrum becomes @xcite :    @xmath97    @xmath98    here @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the two branches of the landau levels , n = 0 , 1 , 2,@xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite only @xmath99 is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical conductivity is then given by : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we take only the n = 0 and n = 1 landau levels . equation ( 6 ) fits very well the @xmath31 data over the whole range of the applied magnetic field , both in the low and high field regimes . </S>",
    "<S> representative plots of the resistivity data measured in 4 , 8 , and 10 t along with the fitting curves are shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> their values are : the anisotropy @xmath61 = @xmath107 , @xmath108 m/s , @xmath109 k and @xmath110 t. this value of the anisotropy @xmath61 of 1.9 is very close to the value of 1.7 required to scale the data shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> note the excellent agreement between the fitting line and the two scaling lines . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even though the model proposed here is quite complex , it gives the two experimentally observed scaling laws at low magnetic field values .    in summary , comprehensive angular dependent resistivity adr measurements in the non - fermi liquid region of cecoin@xmath0 at @xmath123 k </S>",
