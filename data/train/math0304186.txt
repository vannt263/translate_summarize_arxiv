    "the classical theory of root systems associated with finite dimensional semisimple lie algebras admits two generalizations . the first one , the kac  moody theory , originated in the effort to extend the classical theory to include certain classes of infinite dimensional lie algebras as , for example , the simple infinite dimensional lie algebras of vector fields on finite dimensional spaces as classified by cartan at the beginning of the 20th century .",
    "the theory , which was initiated in the mid 1960 s by v. kac and r. moody , grew to be extremely rich and with abundant connections with diverse areas of mathematics .",
    "the second generalization , axiomatized by k. saito , emerged from the theory of semi - universal deformations of simply elliptic singularities and the structure of milnor lattices attached to these singularities .",
    "this second theory is still in the very early stages of development from a representation  theoretical point of view , at present extending only the classical theory of root systems .",
    "these root systems were called by saito @xmath0extended root systems or elliptic root systems .",
    "saito defined in fact more general classes of root systems , @xmath1extended root systems ( @xmath1 being any positive integer ) , but for values of @xmath1 higher than three these do not have any geometrical or representation  theoretical relevance yet .",
    "the problem of attaching corresponding notions of lie algebras and groups to @xmath1extended root systems is wide open although in the elliptic case some constructions exist in the literature .    to briefly compare the two theories note that they include the classical theory and they agree on one other class of root systems",
    ": the 1-extended root systems coincide with affine root systems in kac  moody theory . with this exception",
    ", they produce quite different outcomes . to mention a few differences",
    "note that the weyl groups associated to kac ",
    "moody root systems are always coxeter groups , but the corresponding groups associated to @xmath1extended root systems are not .",
    "also , the weyl group of a @xmath1extended root system does not act properly discontinuously anywhere in its reflection representation and as a consequence we do not have a tits cone , and no natural notion of positive root system or dynkin diagram .",
    "saito was nevertheless able to classify the irreducible elliptic root systems parameterizing them by what he called `` elliptic dynkin diagrams '' .",
    "since , as mentioned above , the weyl groups associated to elliptic root systems ( also called elliptic weyl groups ) are not coxeter groups , a presentation of them in terms of elliptic dynkin diagrams was one of the first questions to be asked .",
    "a candidate for such a presentation was exposed in @xcite .",
    "the presentation is complicated and does not bring any light into the structure of the elliptic weyl group . another problem along these lines which was asked in @xcite is the description of the fundamental group of the complement of the discriminant of the semi ",
    "universal deformation of simply ",
    "elliptic singularities : the elliptic artin group .",
    "in fact , the elliptic weyl groups appeared before of the formal definition of elliptic root systems in the work of looijenga @xcite who considered extended coxeter groups . under this terminology the elliptic weyl groups would be called extended affine weyl groups .",
    "also , the elliptic artin groups were described ( in the non - exceptional cases ) by generators and relations by h. van der lek @xcite under the name of extended artin groups .",
    "the elliptic artin group was recognized by cherednik @xcite as being closely related to his double affine artin groups and hecke algebras .    at this point",
    "a broad picture emerges since cherednik s work has deep connections with quantum many ",
    "body problems , conformal field theory and also with representation theory via macdonald theory , which encloses information about real and @xmath2adic groups and also about affine kac  moody groups .",
    "there are also connections with harmonic analysis , @xmath3riemann zeta functions , gauss  selberg sums and more .",
    "the area is in full development and interesting connections are still to be made .",
    "in all the applications the structure of double affine artin groups and hecke algebras is especially important .    the first results on the structure of double affine hecke algebras appeared in cherednik s work on macdonald s conjectures .",
    "for the proof of the constant term conjecture only basic properties of hecke algebras are used , but for the proof of the evaluation ",
    "duality conjecture a deeper result was needed : the existence of a special involution on double affine hecke algebras called the duality involution .",
    "the existence of this involution is certainly non  obvious , see for example @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) for a proof .",
    "cherednik discovered that in fact this is part of an action of @xmath4 as outer automorphisms of double affine artin groups .",
    "this allows , for example , representations of @xmath5 for which the matrix coefficients are expressed in terms of special values of macdonald polynomials at roots of unity .",
    "let us mention that in the case of a root system of type @xmath6 such actions appeared before in the work of a. kirillov , jr @xcite on modular tensor categories and quantum groups at roots of unity . in this case the two approaches are most probably connected via the equivalence ( see @xcite ) between certain categories of representations of quantum groups and affine kac  moody algebras .",
    "for the root system of type @xmath6 the picture seems to be even richer since @xmath7 ( which is the mapping class group of the torus with one marked point ) can be replaced with the mapping class group of any two dimensional surface with marked points .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to give a completely new description of double affine hecke algebras , artin groups and double affine weyl groups , and consequently of the corresponding elliptic objects .",
    "our description is much simpler than the existing ones and has the virtue of making the existence of the difference fourier transform and of the @xmath5 action mentioned above simple consequences .",
    "all our proofs are at the level of artin groups , since any other result is then obtained by passing to various quotients .",
    "it turns out that in fact all these symmetries of double affine artin groups are descending from those of a new object , which we call triple group , of which the double affine artin group is a quotient .",
    "a brief description of our results follows .",
    "the reader should refer to section [ prelims ] for notation and conventions .",
    "[ maindef ] let @xmath8 be an irreducible affine cartan matrix subject to our restriction and @xmath9 its dynkin diagram .",
    "the triple group @xmath10 is given by generators and relations as follows :    : one generator @xmath11 for each node , with the exception of the affine node for which we have three generators @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath15 .    :",
    "a ) braid relations for each pair of generators associated to any pair of distinct nodes ( note that there are three generators associated to the affine node ) .",
    "\\b ) if the affine node is connected with the node @xmath16 by a single lace , the elements @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the single lace coxeter relation with @xmath19 for all integers @xmath1 .",
    "\\c ) if there are double laces connecting the affine node with the node @xmath16 the following relation holds for any @xmath20 @xmath21    of course we can define the corresponding triple weyl group @xmath22 by further asking that the generators have order two .",
    "all the facts we discuss will have as an immediate consequence corresponding results for the triple weyl group .",
    "a few comments on this definition may be useful at this stage .",
    "we would like to stress that the above definition is not symmetric in the generators @xmath23 which means that the symmetric group on three letters will not act on the triple group .",
    "however , we will prove in theorem [ tripleartinauto ] and theorem [ triplefaith ] that the braid group on three letters acts faithfully as automorphisms of the triple group .",
    "what is completely obvious from this definition is the existence of an _ anti - involution _ which fixes all the generators except @xmath12 and @xmath14 which are interchanged . also , we like to note that in definition [ maindef ] , b ) we ask the relations for the element @xmath17 merely for symmetry .",
    "they follow from the ones for @xmath18 by observing that @xmath24    our main result , theorem [ main ] , shows that the double affine artin group is a quotient of the triple group .",
    "in fact , in this quotient the relations in definition [ maindef ] , b ) will become redundant , allowing us to give a new description of double affine artin groups and hecke algebras .    for double affine artin groups",
    "the descent of the above anti  involution , whose existence is a trivial consequence of our new description , gives ( by composition with the anti - involution which sends all the generators to their inverses ) the duality involution responsible for the difference fourier transform .",
    "note that previous results explaining in an uniform way the existence of this involution required topological arguments @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is also an algebraic proof of this result @xcite .",
    "this proof proceeds by carefully checking of all the necessary relations between the generators in the cherednik presentation and requires special considerations for some types of root systems .    also , the above action of the braid group on three letters descends to double affine artin groups and hecke algebras .",
    "here we rediscover results of cherednik which explain that there is a morphism from the modular group to the group of outer automorphisms of an double affine artin group .",
    "these results are described in theorem [ involution ] , theorem [ doubleartinauto ] and corollary [ cheredthm ] . as another consequence",
    "we obtain descriptions of elliptic weyl groups and elliptic artin groups for certain types of elliptic root systems .",
    "there are interesting quotients of the triple groups of which the double affine artin groups are quotients but which , unlike the triple groups , are described by a finite number of relations . these quotients also inherit the anti  involution and the action of the braid group on three letters .",
    "it is not yet clear if any of these quotients ( or the triple group itself ) have a topological interpretation .",
    "for the most part we adhere to the notation in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be an irreducible _ affine _ cartan matrix , @xmath9 the dynkin diagram and @xmath26 the numerical labels of @xmath9 in table aff from @xcite .",
    "note that we consider that the nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are connected in the dynkin diagram by @xmath29 laces . unless @xmath30 this produces the same diagrams as in @xcite ( we thank craig johnson for pointing this out ) .",
