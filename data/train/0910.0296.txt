    "cabibbo - suppressed ( cs ) and doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) decays play an important role in studies of charmed hadron dynamics .",
    "cs decays of nearly all the charmed hadrons have been observed , while dcs decays have been observed for only @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons .",
    "the nave expectation for the dcs decay rate is of the order of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the cabibbo mixing angle @xcite , or about @xmath14 relative to its cabibbo - favored ( cf ) counterpart . as given in @xcite for the numerical estimate . ]",
    "one expects that the branching ratio of @xmath1 is about @xmath15 relative to its cf counterpart since the phase space for @xmath16 is suppressed due to the two identical pions in the final state .",
    "this expectation is consistent with current experimental results @xcite .",
    "therefore , we also expect the branching ratio of @xmath0 is about @xmath17 relative to its cf counterpart .",
    "lipkin @xcite argues that su(3 ) flavor symmetry , @xmath18 . ]",
    "implies @xmath19 where differences in the phase space for cf and dcs decay modes cancel in the ratios .",
    "the above relation does not take into account possible su(3 ) breaking effects that could arise due to resonant intermediate states in the three - body final states considered here @xcite .",
    "in addition , decays of charmed mesons play important role in understanding the sources of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking effects @xcite .",
    "such breaking effects can originate from strong final - state interactions or interference between same final states .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are cs decays with the color - favored tree , annihilation and penguin diagrams . for @xmath10 decays ,",
    "the branching ratio @xmath22 deviates from the nave expectation of @xmath23 @xcite , due to a destructive interference between color - favored and color - suppressed amplitude in @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , converting experimental measurements including @xmath25 branching ratios to those of involving @xmath26 is not straightforward due to the fact that one must take into account the interference between dcs decay and cf decay modes where the interference phase is unknown @xcite . in @xmath27",
    "decays to @xmath28 and @xmath29 final states , the ratio of cs decay to that of the corresponding cf decay may be larger than @xmath23 , since @xmath30 decay mode is a cf but color - suppressed decay mode . precise branching ratio measurements of cs and cf charm meson decay modes can thus help in understanding the underlying dynamics of these decays .",
    "the data used in the analysis were recorded at the @xmath31 resonance with the belle detector @xcite at the @xmath3 asymmetric - energy collider kekb @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to an integrated luminosity of @xmath2 .",
    "we require that the charged tracks originate from the vicinity of the interaction point with impact parameters in the beam direction ( @xmath34-axis ) and perpendicular to it of less than 4 cm and 2 cm , respectively .",
    "all charged tracks are required to have at least two associated hits in the silicon vertex detector @xcite , both in the @xmath34 and radial directions , to assure good spatial resolution on the @xmath35 mesons decay vertices .",
    "the decay vertex is formed by fitting the three charged tracks to a common vertex and requiring a confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "greater than 0.1% .",
    "charged kaons and pions are identified requiring the ratio of particle identification likelihoods , @xmath36 , constructed using information from the central drift chamber , time - of - flight counters , and aerogel cherenkov counters @xcite , to be larger or smaller than 0.6 , respectively . in addition , we require that the scaled momentum of the charmed meson candidate @xmath37 be greater than 0.5 to suppress combinatorial background as well as @xmath35 mesons produced in @xmath38 meson decays . here",
    "@xmath39 is the charmed meson momentum and @xmath40 is the total @xmath3 collision energy calculated in the center - of - mass frame .    in order to suppress the high background level , we apply further selection criteria , which are optimized using real data samples since there are some discrepancies between the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite and the data in the relevant distributions .",
    "we use 10% of the data samples for optimization and the remaining 90% for the measurement to avoid a possible bias when the same samples are used for both optimization and the measurement . assuming no signal in the dcs decay channel , we maximize @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the cf signal yield which has similar properties to the dcs signal and @xmath43 is the background yield from the sideband regions in the dcs sample .",
    "( top ) and @xmath44 ( bottom ) .",
    "the @xmath45 distribution is shown on a semilogarithmic scale to make the small background visible .",
    "points with error bars show the data and histograms show the results of the fits described in the text .",
    "signal , @xmath46 background , and random combinatorial background components are also shown.,width=302 ]    one of the selections related to the finite lifetime of charmed hadrons is the reduced @xmath47 ( @xmath47/d.o.f ) for the hypothesis that the candidate tracks for the charmed meson decay products arise from the primary vertex .",
    "the primary vertex is obtained as the most probable point of intersection of the meson s momentum vector and the @xmath3 interaction region . because of the finite lifetime of @xmath10 and @xmath27 mesons their daughter tracks are not likely to be compatible with the primary vertex .",
    "the second requirement uses the angle between the charmed meson momentum vector , as reconstructed from the daughter tracks , and the vector joining its production and decay vertices . in an ideal case without resolution the two vectors would be parallel for the signal .",
    "the reduced @xmath47 is required to be greater than 25 for @xmath10 and 5 for @xmath27 candidates and the angle is required to be less than @xmath48 for @xmath10 and @xmath49 for @xmath27 candidates .",
    "tighter requirements on charged kaon identification ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are also chosen for the final selection , which improves the signal sensitivity .",
    "after the additional and tighter selection requirements described above , 9.57% of @xmath10 and 10.71% of @xmath27 cf signal and 0.06% of @xmath10 and 0.24% of @xmath27 dcs background events are retained . in order to minimize systematic effects we choose the same selection criteria for both dcs and cf decay channels .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 invariant mass distributions after the final selections are shown in figures [ fig_02.eps ] and [ fig_03.eps ] together with signal and background parametrizations .",
    "a clear signal is observed in both dcs decay mass distributions .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 invariant mass distributions are fitted using the binned maximum likelihood method . in all cases",
    "the signal probability density function ( pdf ) is parametrized using two gaussians with the same central value .",
    "because of @xmath55 misidentification the following reflection backgrounds appear in the mass distributions . in @xmath56 ( cf ) and @xmath57 ( dcs )",
    "decays there is a contribution from misidentified @xmath46 decays ; in @xmath46 ( dcs ) decay there is a contribution from misidentified @xmath33 decay .",
    "the pdfs for the refection backgrounds are determined from real data by assigning the nominal pion ( kaon ) mass to a kaon ( pion ) track .",
    "the magnitude of each of the reflection background contributions is a free parameter in the fit . for the dcs @xmath27 channel , the @xmath33 contribution",
    "is not incorporated in the fit since it is not significant , but its effect is included as a systematic uncertainty due to fitting listed in table [ dcs_systematics ] .",
    "the @xmath58 contributions ( @xmath59 with @xmath60 ) in the cf @xmath27 channel is also incorporated in the cf @xmath27 fit as an independent gaussian component .",
    "a linear function is used for the random combinatorial background for all channels .",
    "all signal and background parameters for the cf channels are floated . for the dcs channels the mass , width , and ratio of the two signal gaussians",
    "are fixed to the values obtained from the fits to distributions of cf decays .",
    "signal and background yields are left free in the fit . from the results of the fits , shown in figures [ fig_02.eps ] and [ fig_03.eps ] , we extract the signal yield for each channel , listed together with the corresponding branching ratios in table [ br ] .",

    "@xmath61 is the branching ratio relative to @xmath56 for the @xmath10 modes and @xmath46 for the @xmath27 modes .",
