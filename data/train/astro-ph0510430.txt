    "ultracompact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) are very tight , interacting binaries ( @xmath5 cm orbit ) with periods @xmath6 min .",
    "they contain neutron stars ( nss ) or black holes accreting from a low - mass ( @xmath7 ) degenerate companion .",
    "ucxbs are a sub - class of the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "it has been known for a long time that bright lmxbs are found to be overabundant in globular clusters ( gcs ) compared to the galactic field ( katz 1975 , clark 1975 ) .",
    "this leads to the suggestion that lmxbs , and consequently ucxbs , are preferentially formed in the dense environment of the gc cores through various stellar interactions , such as direct collisions between a ns and a red giant ( verbunt 1987 , davies et al .",
    "1992 , ivanova et al .",
    "2005 ) , tidal capture of a main sequence star by a ns ( bailyn & grindlay 1987 ) , or exchange interactions between nss and primordial binaries ( rasio et al .",
    "it has been suggested that most of the 13 bright lmxbs in gcs might be ucxbs ( bildsten & deloye 2004 , ivanova et al .",
    ". however , only two are confirmed in gcs to date .",
    "these are 4u1820 - 30 in ngc6624 ( @xmath8 min , stella et al .",
    "1987 ) and 4u1850 - 087 in ngc6712 ( @xmath9 min , homer et al .  1996 ) .",
    "two other gc sources have been suggested as particularly strong ucxb candidates ( homer 2003 ) .",
    "one of these candidates is cxoj212958.1 + 121002 in m15 , also known as m15 x-2 ( white & angelini 2001 ) .",
    "m15 is the only galactic gc known to harbour _ two _ bright lmxbs .",
    "a single source was detected in early x - ray studies , 4u2127 + 119 , and that was identified with the optical counterpart ac211 ( aurire et al .",
    "1984 , charles et al .",
    "chandra _ observations later on resolved 4u2127 + 119 into _ two _ x - ray sources ( white & angelini 2001 ) .",
    "one of these was the previously known lmxb ac211 .",
    "the second source , cxoj212958.1 + 121002 or m15 x-2 , is actually 2.5 times brighter than ac211 in x - rays .",

    "( 1996 ) , white & angelini ( 2001 ) identified a blue @xmath10 mag star as the optical counterpart to the second source ( star 590 in demarchi & paresce 1994 ) .",
    "however , the orbital period of m15 x-2 has so far not been determined .    here",
    ", we present fuv data of m15 x-2 taken with the _ hst _ that allow us to classify the source as an ucxb . in sect .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "m15 was observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the _ hst _ in september and october 2003 , and october to december 2004 .",
    "images were taken using the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) filters f140lp , f150lp , and f165lp in the solar blind channel ( sbc ) , and the near - uv ( nuv ) f220w filter in the high resolution channel ( hrc ) .    for our variability study ( see sect .",
    "[ analysis ] ) only relative magnitudes are needed .",
    "these were derived directly from the individual flatfielded images .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out using daophot ( stetson 1991 ) running under iraf using an aperture radius of 4 pixels and a sky annulus of 50 to 60 pixels .",
    "for this purpose , we only used the 90 exposures taken in sbc / f140lp , since these data provide the longest time coverage ( from october 14 to december 5 , 2004 ) .",
    "eighty of these images had exposure times of 300 sec , four were exposed for 140 sec and six for 40 sec .",
    "one orbit of observation yielded 9 data points .    in order to determine the time - averaged spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of our counterpart",
    ", we also carried out _ absolute _ photometry on combined and geometrically corrected images for each filter .",
    "these master images were created using multidrizzle running under pyraf . for our aperture photometry",
    ", we used an aperture radius of 5 pixels for all sbc fuv data , a smaller radius of 4 pixels in the hrc nuv data , and a sky annulus of 5 to 7 pixels .",
    "the smaller aperture in the nuv was chosen to avoid the effects of severe crowding . in the fuv",
    ", aperture corrections were determined via curves of growth constructed from isolated stars in our master images .",
    "for the nuv data , we used the encircled energy fractions published by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in order to derive a reliable sed",
    ", we ideally want mean fluxes in non - overlapping wavelength windows .",
    "however , the acs / sbc / f140lp bandpass fully includes f150lp , and f150lp in turn includes f165lp .",
    "we therefore created two artificial narrow - band filters that are defined as the differences between the actual filters , i.e.  we define f140n = f150lp - f140lp and f150n = f150lp - f165lp .",
    "thus the count rate of a source in f140n , for example , is simply obtained by subtracting its count rate in f150lp from that in f140lp .",
    "[ spect ] ( top panel ) shows the resulting throughput curves for the artificial filters .",
    "as can be seen , they barely overlap and are thus ideal for characterizing the uv sed of our source . in order to convert count rates into stmags",
    ", we used the synphot package running under iraf .",
    "full details on our analysis procedure will be provided in a forthcoming publication that will present our entire fuv / nuv data set for m15 .",
    "we identified the fuv counterparts to ac211 and to m15 x-2 on the f140lp images , using the guhathakurta et al .",

    "positions for these sources are also indicated , after shifting them by @xmath11  south in order to optimally align the x - ray and fuv positions of ac211 .",
    "the centre of the fuv counterpart to m15 x-2 is slightly offset ( @xmath12 south ) of the _ chandra _ position , but still well within the internal @xmath13 _ chandra _ error radius for this source ( white & angelini 2001 ) .",
    "our offset is consistent with the @xmath14 offset that white & angelini ( 2001 ) found between their _ chandra _ positions and the optical counterpart from demarchi & paresce ( 1994 ) .",
    "both ac211 and m15 x-2 are clearly detected as strong fuv and nuv sources in our acs images .",
    "[ lightcurve ] shows the mean - subtracted light curve for all observing epochs .",
    "low - amplitude variations with a peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath15 mag can be seen .",
    "we searched for a periodic signal by carrying out @xmath16 fits for a grid of trial frequencies .",
    "the resulting periodogram is shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "the best fit yields a @xmath17 and suggests a period of @xmath18 min . in order to test the coherence of this period",
    ", we carried out monte carlo simulations .",
    "briefly , we created 10000 fake data sets with the same time sampling , periodic signal and noise characteristics as our real data , but with a random phase offset assigned to each of the six observing epochs .",
    "thus the phase was fully coherent within each epoch , but fully randomized between them .",
    "we then again carried out a sequence of @xmath16  fits for each data set .",
    "next , we fixed the period at the best global value and fitted each epoch separately with both phase and amplitude as free parameters .",
    "we then defined a _ phase coherence index _",
    "( pci , see e.g.  haswell et al .",
    "1997 ) , which in our case is simply the @xmath16 of the phase estimates for the individual epochs , with the phase of the global fit as the reference value .",
    "_ we find that only 0.9% of the fake data with randomized phases have a pci as good as the real data .",
    "_ we can therefore reject the null hypothesis that the periodic signal loses coherence completely over time - scales comparable to our inter - epoch spacing .",
    "the latter is @xmath19 days , corresponding to @xmath20 cycles .",
    "we can view this as a constraint on the period derivative , i.e. @xmath21 must be small enough so that less than one cycle is lost over @xmath22 cycles , i.e.  @xmath23 .",
    "the quality factor of the 22.58  min signal must therefore be @xmath24 .",
    "by contrast , mhz qpos tend to have @xmath25 ( e.g. chakrabarty et al .  2001 , boroson et al .",
    "2000 ) . as a further check",
    ", we carried out monte carlo simulations in which the input sinusoids were coherent , i.e. the phase was fixed at the same value for each epoch .",
    "this produced a pci distribution that was consistent with the pci of the real data set .",
    "thus the 22.58  min signal is consistent with being fully coherent over the entire @xmath26  cycles spanned by our observations .",
    "all of these tests support the orbital nature of this signal .",
    "we also used our monte carlo simulations to estimate the statistical error on the parameters of the observed signal . for this purpose",
    ", we again used coherent input signals and conservatively used error bars scaled so as to yield @xmath27 for the fit to the real data .",
    "we then used the standard deviation of the periods and amplitudes found for the fake data sets to estimate the errors on the measured parameters .",
    "the final results were @xmath28 min for the orbital period and @xmath29 mag for the semi - amplitude .",
    "this yields an ephemeris for the time of maximum light @xmath30 where the numbers in brackets give the errors on the last two digits .    a sine wave with m15x-2 s period , amplitude and fixed phase is overplotted on the lightcurves in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] .",
    "this visually confirms that there is no sign of a loss of coherence over the entire observational time span of 3312 cycles .",
    "we conclude that the periodic signal is almost certainly an orbital modulation .",
    "min which corresponds to a nyquist frequency of @xmath31",
    ". a period of @xmath32 min above @xmath33 could be reflected to yield our observed signal of 22.6 min . however , such short orbital periods are extremely unlikely ( see e.g. deloye & bildsten 2003 , homer 2003 ) . ]",
    "the sed of m15 x-2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ spect ] ( top panel ) .",
    "each point is plotted at the average wavelength of the corresponding filter .",
    "as expected for compact , interacting binaries , the sed of m15 x-2 rises towards the blue .",
    "however , it is also worth noting that there seems to be an excess of flux in f150n , i.e.  around 1550  ",
    ". this excess flux can be caused by additional civ @xmath34  and / or heii @xmath35    line emission .",
    "we therefore fit a power law to the two bracketing data points only .",
    "the best fit is found for a power - law index @xmath36 .",
    "this power - law spectrum is overplotted in fig .",
    "[ spect ] .",
    "the depression at @xmath37 is due to a well known reddening feature there .",
    "the excess flux in f150n seems to indicate line emission due to civ at  @xmath34    and/or heii @xmath35    ( the latter would also contribute to f165lp ) .",
    "however , such a peak might also be caused simply by a turnover in an otherwise smooth continuum .",
    "we have therefore carried out synthetic photometry for blackbodies ( bbs ) with temperatures @xmath38 .",
    "[ spect ] ( bottom panel ) shows the resulting bb sequence in the f140n - f150n vs f150n - f165lp colour - colour diagram ( cc diagram ) .",
    "note that we reddened all synthetic photometry by m15 s @xmath39 mag ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "as expected , the bbs are located on a sequence going from blue ( for hot sources ) to red colours ( for cool sources ) .",
    "the cross on the sequence marks @xmath40 k , which is the temperature of a bb peaking at @xmath34   , in the centre of the f150n filter .",
    "the observed location of m15 x-2 in the cc diagram is also marked and is clearly distinct from the blackbody sequence .",
    "the reason is simply that the f150n filter is much narrower than the peaks of the bb distributions .",
    "thus , the latter can not cause a strong excess in this filter alone .",
    "we caution that true stellar spectra _ can _ have turnovers more sharp than suggested from a comparison with bb spectra , as the example of ac211 shows ( downes et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the location of a power - law @xmath3 spectrum is also marked in the cc diagram . in order to check",
    "how strong a line might be needed to account for the observed flux excess , we have also carried out synthetic photometry of power law spectra ( with index -2.0 ) _ and _ an emission line at civ @xmath34    with equivalent widths ( ew ) of 10    to 50   . as can be seen , m15 x-2",
    "is located close to the power - law + civ 1550    sequence , but slightly above , which suggests additional heii emission .",
    "we then carried out synthetic photometry of power law spectra and civ @xmath34    ( @xmath41  ) _ and _ heii @xmath35    emission line with ews of 10  to 60   .",
    "we conclude that the sed of m15 x-2 can be described by a power - law @xmath3 with an additional civ 1550    and heii 1640    emission line with @xmath42    each .",
    "however , given that there are three free parameters in this model , a perfect match to just three colours is of course guaranteed .",
    "spectroscopy will be needed to confirm the spectral shape and the existence of line emission .",
    "knowledge of the orbital period of m15 x-2 allows us to derive a more defined picture of this ultracompact system .",
    "eggleton ( 1983 ) showed that for small mass ratios @xmath43 the mean density @xmath44 of the roche lobe - filling companion becomes a function of @xmath45 mainly , i.e.  @xmath46 .",
    "for an orbital period of 22.6 min , this gives @xmath47 which is consistent with the mean density of a low - mass white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "we can then use the mass - radius relationships published by deloye & bildsten ( 2003 , their fig .",
    "4 ) to constrain the minimum mass of the donor star to @xmath48 and its minimum radius to @xmath49 , depending on composition .",
    "these lower limits correspond to low - temperature donors . using kepler s 3rd law and assuming a ns - dominated system mass near @xmath50",
    ", we estimate the binary separation to @xmath51 cm .",
    "a blackbody of @xmath52 k has a blue spectral slope most similar to the one we fitted to m15 x-2 ( see fig .",
    "[ spect ] ) . placed at m15 s distance , such a blackbody would have a radius of @xmath53 cm or @xmath54 if it is to have the same flux that we measured for m15 x-2 .",
    "this is larger than expected for the radius @xmath55 of the degenerate companion , but comparable to the circularization radius of @xmath56 of the accretion disk .",
    "we therefore conclude that the fuv light is coming from the accretion disk rather than from the wd donor .",
    "this is consistent with the ucxb model of arons & king ( 1993 ) in which the orbital modulation is then caused by the irradiation of the wd donor . using their eq .",
    "15 we then estimate the inclination angle of the system @xmath57 .",
    "this face - on inclination is consistent with the absence of eclipses .",
    "we note that no modulation can be seen in x - rays ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "m15 x-2 s x - ray luminosity was found to be @xmath58 ( white & angelini 2001 , hannikainen et al .",
    "2005 ) . assuming a 10 km radius and a mass of @xmath59 for the ns",
    ", this requires @xmath60 .",
    "this can be compared to the accretion rate expected from conservative mass transfer driven by angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation in an ucxb @xmath61 taking our minimum donor mass and corresponding mass - radius index @xmath62 ( e.g. deloye & bildsten 2003 ) , we derive a lower limit of @xmath63 .",
    "this suggests that the observed x - ray emission can be powered by gravitational radiation - driven mass transfer .",
    "we conclude that m15 x-2 can be classified as an ucxb , only the third confirmed such system in a gc .",
    "our results are consistent with the idea that indeed many gc lmxbs are ucxbs .",
