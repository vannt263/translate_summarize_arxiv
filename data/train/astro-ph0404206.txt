    "one of the fundamental assumptions of cosmology is that the universe is isotropic .",
    "such an assumption necessarily implies therefore that the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) should be the same in all directions on the sky . the firas experiment on the cobe satellite @xcite demonstrated that the mean temperature of the cmb is isotropic to high precision , but it is only now with the superior sensitivity of the _ _ wmap _ _ @xcite data that the isotropic nature of the angular fluctuations in the cmb can be tested .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the variation in the angular power spectrum of the cmb determined from patches sampling different locations on the sky . in an isotropic universe",
    ", there should be no preferred direction and these locally determined angular power spectra , after allowing for some sample variance , should demonstrate the same expectation value over all positions . here , we adopt the gabor transform method proposed in @xcite and estimate the power spectrum in discs with 9.5 and 19 degree radius and then on hemispheres , thus allowing either high spatial localisation or high angular resolution , both of which are used to probe the directional dependence of the anisotropy .",
    "the discs on which we estimate the power spectrum are positioned such that they cover as much area as possible without overlapping so much as to introduce strong correlations between the locally estimated spectra . with the smaller discs , we can test the isotropy of the spectrum at a high spatial resolution , but small patches limit the resolution in multipole space . by increasing the size of the discs we test the isotropy of the spectrum at a refined resolution in multipole space but at the cost of a low spatial resolution .",
    "we apply different tests of consistency between the spectra in different multipole bins , comparing with a monte carlo ensemble generated with the best fit model spectrum obtained by the _ wmap _ team and using the noise and beam properties of _",
    "wmap_. we have chosen to focus on the co - added w+v map as these are the channels in which the foreground contamination is expected to be lowest . in all cases , only data outside of the _ wmap _ kp2 sky cut is included in the analysis .    with this approach we can also test for the presence of contaminating residual foregrounds or systematic effects .",
    "for example , incorrectly subtracted galactic foregrounds would most likely manifest asymmetry in the galactic frame of reference , with an increasingly likely level of residual contamination towards the plane .",
    "similarly , systematic effects would plausibly align with the ecliptic frame of reference reflecting the scanning strategy of the satellite .",
    "in addition , contamination of the data due to solar system emission would be confined to the ecliptic plane . for these reasons ,",
    "we compare the statistical distribution of the power spectrum estimates in both the galactic and ecliptic northern and southern hemispheres , as well as the pole and equatorial regions for these reference frames .    we will in particular check the positional dependence of some features in the power spectrum observed by _ wmap _ @xcite : two at large scales corresponding to bins centered around @xmath4 and @xmath5 , one close to the first doppler peak and one close to the first trough ( the latter was not seen in the analysis by _ wmap _ ) .",
    "moreover we investigate the recent claims of an asymmetry of the large scale structure between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres @xcite . as the asymmetry",
    "is reported to be seen at the largest scales , we use the results of the power spectra estimated on hemispheres where the multipole resolution is large enough to resolve different features between @xmath6 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : gabtrans ] we outline the method described in @xcite to estimate the power spectrum on a patch on the sky using the so called gabor transforms .",
    "the details of the data set used in the paper is outlined in section [ sect : data ] . in section",
    "[ sect : small ] we show the results of the local _ wmap _ spectra estimated on discs of radius @xmath7 .",
    "we check for consistency between the locally estimated spectra in different multipole bins and different directions . to check the results at a higher multipole resolution",
    ", the analysis is repeated in section [ sect : medium ] with discs of radius @xmath8 . in section [",
    "sect : hemis ] we check for an asymmetry in the large scale structure and report results of the _ wmap _ spectra estimated on hemispheres .",
    "in particular , we test the robustness of the results using other frequency channels and a variety of sky cuts .",
    "finally , section [ sect : concl ] summarise our results .",
    "in @xcite ( from now on hgh ) we introduced the method of gabor transforms on the sphere and showed how its application could be used to analyse the cmb power spectrum , using the pseudo - spectral information from a given patch on the sky .",
    "the pseudo spectrum is used as input data to a likelihood analysis for an axi - symmetric patch on the sky .",
    "for such a sky partition , the correlation properties of the sky signal can be calculated analytically . in this paper , we extend the method to an arbitrary asymmetric patch on the sky , by using monte - carlo pre - calculations of the correlation matrix . in this section we will outline the method as described in hgh .",
    "the details of the extension to arbitrary patches are deferred to the appendix , here we will focus on the results .",
    "we define the pseudo power spectrum @xmath9 as the power spectrum obtained using the spherical harmonic transform on a cmb temperature field @xmath10 multiplied with a window function @xmath11 .",
    "letting @xmath12 be the spherical harmonic coefficients of the cmb field and @xmath13 the corresponding power spectrum , the corresponding quantity on the windowed sky is indicated by a tilde and can be written as    @xmath14    where @xmath15    this pseudo spectrum can be written in terms of the full sky spectrum by means of the following formulae : @xmath16 where the kernel @xmath17 can be calculated analytically by the formulae given in hgh , or by monte - carlo methods as described here in the appendix .    the method proposed in hgh was to sample a disk - like region of the observed sky @xmath10 using a top - hat or a gaussian window @xmath18 .",
    "the pseudo power spectrum of this disc was then used as the input vector to a likelihood analysis , assuming the distribution of the @xmath9 to be gaussian .",
    "it was demonstrated that this is a good approximation when the multipole @xmath0 is sufficiently high , which for a gaussian window with @xmath19 fwhm corresponded to @xmath20 .",
    "hgh employed the following likelihood ansatz : @xmath21 where the elements of the data vector are @xmath22 here the first term is the observed pseudo power spectrum including noise and the second term is the expected signal pseudo spectrum obtained from equation ( [ eq : pcl ] ) . the last term contains the expected noise pseudo spectrum for the patch .",
    "similarly , the matrix expressing the correlation between the pseudo power spectrum coefficients can be written as @xmath23 where there is one contribution from the signal ( s ) , one from the noise ( n ) and one from signal - noise mixing ( x ) .",
    "the form of these matrices and how they can be computed are discussed in hgh for an axi - symmetric region of the sky . here , in the appendix",
    ", we show how to extend the calculation of these matrices to an arbitrarily shaped patch using a monte - carlo approach .",
    "note that this likelihood expression is a function of the underlying full sky power spectrum @xmath13 which we want to estimate .",
    "the best estimate is the power spectrum which maximises this likelihood .",
    "+ note that one can not use all @xmath9 in the analysis , as the correlation matrix will then be overdetermined .",
    "following hgh , the optimal spacing in @xmath0-space is given by the width of the kernel and can be expressed approximately as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of the window in degrees .",
    "we will call the number of samples ( @xmath9 ) to be used , @xmath26 . also , one can not estimate all the full sky power spectrum coefficients @xmath13 as there is not enough information in a disc to obtain an estimate of every single multipole .",
    "for this reason we use a limited number @xmath27 of flat power spectrum bins . as discussed in hgh",
    "this number should be smaller than @xmath26 to allow for at least 3 - 4 observations ( @xmath9 ) per bin . a more complete discussion on the number of input multipoles and full sky bins to use is given in hgh .",
    "in hgh it was also demonstrated that one can simultaneously include the pseudo power spectra from several discs in order to analyse a full sky observation . in this case , the log - likelihood can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the full data vector of disc number @xmath30 , @xmath31 is similarly the correlation matrix of disc @xmath30 and @xmath32 is the number of discs considered .",
    "this form of the likelihood assumes the @xmath9 between different discs to be uncorrelated . for minimally overlapping discs",
    "this can remain a good approximation .",
    "it will be demonstrated later that for the set of discs used here , only a tiny correlation between the estimated power spectra of overlapping discs is introduced .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use these locally estimated spectra to investigate the isotropy of the cmb in the _ wmap _ data .",
    "we will assume the best fit _",
    "wmap _ running index spectrum , make a monte - carlo ensemble of estimated power spectra on discs of different sizes and compare these to the spectra estimated on the _ wmap _ data set .",
    "in this paper we analyse the publicly available _ wmap _ data after correction for galactic foregrounds .",
    "we consider data from the v and w frequency bands only since these are less likely to be contaminated by residual foregrounds .",
    "the maps from the different channels are coadded using inverse noise - weighting ; @xmath33 where @xmath34 runs over the frequency channels v1,v2,w1,w2,w3,w4 . in the simulations we have been generating maps smoothing with a beam and adding noise equal to the effective beam and noise of the co - added w+v channel ( also available on the lambda website ) .",
    "the input power spectrum in the simulation was the best fit _",
    "wmap _ running - index spectrum .",
    "most of the analysis in this paper has been performed using the _ wmap _ kp2 sky cut , including the point source mask . in those cases",
    "where , in order to test the robustness of the results , we have used either an alternate power spectrum , different frequency channels or different masks , the differences have been clearly stated .",
    "it should be noted that the _ wmap _ team have utilised the cross - spectra between different channels for their estimation of the power spectrum , which is therefore less dependent on the exact noise properties of the experiment than in our case .",
    "here we have adopted the approximate white noise model provided by the _",
    "wmap _ team , and uncertainties in this model could result in erroneous estimates on smaller angular scales where the multipoles are noise dominated .",
    "in fact , it has been determined that the noise level estimated using the tail of the pseudo power spectrum on a given disc is slightly higher than that obtained using the white noise model . in principle , this could be accounted for using the 110 noise realizations per channel , which include all of the effects of the full data processing pipeline , that have been made available by the _",
    "team on the lambda website . in practise , this number is not sufficient to converge to an accurate estimate of the statistical properties of the noise for individual discs .",
    "in this section , we test the isotropy of the cmb with high spatial sensitivity by estimating the power spectrum on discs of radius @xmath7 . as a consequence of the small disc size ,",
    "the multipoles are strongly coupled and wide power spectrum bins must be employed . using a set of simulated maps we have created a monte - carlo ensemble of estimates of the power spectrum on individual small discs from the disc set , and additionally estimates of the power spectrum corresponding to larger sample regions by combining several discs .",
    "these are then compared to the estimates derived from the _ wmap _ data .      with the method described above , we have estimated the angular power spectrum for 164 discs with an angular radius of @xmath7 uniformly distributed on the part of the sphere outside of the _ wmap _ kp2 sky cut .",
    "the disc position and disc size was chosen in order to cover as much as possible of the observed sky with as many samples ( discs ) as possible without losing too much multipole resolution ( i.e. to maintain enough power spectrum bins to resolve the shape of the power spectrum ) .",
    "the overlap of the discs was also kept to a minimum in order to reduce correlations between the locally estimated spectra .",
    "we sampled the pseudo spectrum in @xmath35 points which we used as input data to the likelihood estimation procedure .",
    "we then estimated @xmath36 power spectrum bins in the multipole range @xmath37 .",
    "as the correlation matrix in the likelihood can become singular if the observed area is too small , we have excluded all discs where less than @xmath38 of the disc area remains after application of the kp2 mask . in figure",
    "[ fig : discnumbers ] we show the remaining 130 discs with the numbering which will be used in the following treatment .",
    "the distance in the latitudinal @xmath25 direction between the disc centres going from the galactic poles to the equator is roughly @xmath39 and in the longitudinal @xmath40 direction the centres are all at an equal distance for a given galactic latitude .",
    "the 12 power spectrum bins @xmath41 are summarised in table ( [ tab : smallbins ] ) .",
    "as described in hgh , the @xmath13 coupling kernel has a similar width at all scales , giving a similar resolution over all multipoles .",
    "therefore we have adopted bins of a fixed size @xmath42 in the whole multipole range .",
    ".the power spectrum bins for the @xmath7 disc estimates.[tab : smallbins ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have applied a method of local power spectrum estimation to small regions of the cmb sky as measured by the _ wmap _ satellite in order to search for evidence of spatial dependence in the computed spectra beyond that due to sampling variance alone . in this way",
    ", we are able to confront one of the central tenets of modern cosmology , namely that of cosmological isotropy . as an important consequence of this analysis ,",
    "we are also able to mitigate against foreground or systematic artefacts in the data .",
    "specifically , we have estimated the angular power spectrum in different spatial directions within discs of radius @xmath7 and @xmath8 and on hemispheres .",
    "since by increasing the disc size we increase the resolution of the power spectrum estimation in multipole space but lower the sensitivity to the spatial dependence of the estimate , the combination of these scales allows us to achieve high fidelity in both real and @xmath0 space .    on small angular scales and specifically for two power spectrum bins , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , close to the first doppler peak , we found that the highest deviations , relative to the best fit model preferred by the _ wmap _",
    "team , was seen in the power spectrum estimates for those medium sized discs close to the galactic plane .",
    "this was also the case for an interval in @xmath0-space spanning the ` dent ' in the power spectrum as estimated by the global analysis of the _ wmap _ team . by excluding those discs close to the galactic plane with a local spectrum deviating by more than @xmath45 from the best fit model , we find a resulting power spectrum with no dent and a slightly higher doppler peak .",
    "we consider this to be a tentative indication of possible residual galactic foreground contamination .",
    "when studying the distribution of large scale power using the small and medium sized discs , we found that the northern galactic and ecliptic hemispheres seemed to show a remarkable lack of large scale power . in order to further investigate this apparent lack of isotropy",
    ", we estimated the power spectrum for the first 60 multipoles on hemispheres centred on various directions on the sky .",
    "the multipole range @xmath1 was found to be strongly asymmetric with the galactic north - south axis as the axis of maximum asymmetry .",
    "furthermore we found that the spatial dependence of the variations in amplitude for this multipole range was similar to the morphology seen in the integrated foreground template contribution , suggesting that the low order multipoles may remain compromised by residual galactic emission ( this was also noted by @xcite ) .",
    "the other multipoles between @xmath2 however , are asymmetric with the axis pointing in the direction @xmath3 in galactic co - latitude and longitude , close to the ecliptic axis . in the northern hemisphere of the reference frame of maximum asymmetry",
    ", almost the full multipole range between @xmath2 is below the average amplitude .",
    "the strong negative outlier at @xmath4 found in the _ wmap _ global estimate of the power spectrum , is associated specifically with this hemisphere .",
    "conversely , in the southern hemisphere of maximum asymmetry , almost all multipoles in the range @xmath2 are above the average amplitude , and a positive outlier at @xmath5 , as seen in the _ wmap _ global spectrum , is found",
    ". the asymmetry does not appear to be associated with a particular anomalous region on the sky , but extends over a large area , as evidenced by the small and medium disc results .",
    "we have checked the possibility that incorrectly removed foregrounds could cause the observed large scale asymmetry by testing the dependency on galactic cut and frequency channel .",
    "the observed asymmetry is remarkably stable with respect to both frequency and sky coverage , thus arguing against this possibility .",
    "moreover , the results seem unlikely to be compromised by systematics since we find supporting evidence ( albeit at reduced statistical significance ) for similar features in the _ cobe_-dmr maps , which are susceptible to _ different _ parasitic signals .",
    "similar asymmetric structures have been determined by a number of other groups @xcite using several alternative analysis techniques .",
    "besides finding asymmetry , non - gaussian features have also been detected in the northern and/or southern hemispheres .",
    "since some of the non - gaussian estimators used are power spectrum dependent , the detection of non - gaussianity on opposite hemispheres may be related to the uneven distribution of large scale power studied in this paper .",
    "given the large number of detections with different methods on different sky cuts and frequency channels , it seems inescapable that the _ wmap _ data does indeed contain unexpected properties on large scales . in the absence of compelling evidence for a galactic or systematic origin for the asymmetry",
    ", the intriguing possibility is raised that the cosmological principle of isotropy is violated and that fundamentally new physics on large scales in the universe is required .",
    "further clarification of this scenario awaits further observations from _ wmap _ , and ultimately the forthcoming planck satellite mission .    .",
