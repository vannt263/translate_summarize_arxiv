    "driven by the emergence of new applications , growing demand for high data rates and increased number of users , energy consumption of wireless systems has gradually increased , leading to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions , consequent environmental concerns and high energy prices and operating costs .",
    "therefore , optimal and efficient use of energy resources with the goal of reducing costs and minimizing the carbon footprint of wireless systems is of paramount importance , and energy - efficient design has become a vital consideration in wireless communications from the perspective of green operation . in addition , bandwidth bottleneck is a critical concern in wireless services since there are only limited spectral resources to accommodate multiple users and multiple wireless applications operating simultaneously . despite this fact , the report released by the federal communication commission showed that a large portion of the radio spectrum is not fully utilized most of the time @xcite .",
    "hence , inefficiency in the spectrum usage opens the possibility for a new communication paradigm , called as cognitive radio @xcite , @xcite . in cognitive radio systems , unlicensed ( cognitive or secondary )",
    "users are able to opportunistically access the frequency bands allocated to the licensed ( primary ) users as long as interference inflicted on primary users is limited below tolerable levels .",
    "hence , cognitive radio leads to the dynamic and more efficient utilization of the available spectrum .    motivated by the energy efficiency ( ee ) and spectral efficiency ( se ) requirements and the need to address them jointly , we in this paper study ee in cognitive radio systems .",
    "more specifically , we investigate energy - efficient power allocation strategies in a practical setting with imperfect spectrum sensing .",
    "ee in cognitive radio systems has been recently addressed in @xcite - @xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite highlighted the benefits of cognitive radio systems for green wireless communications .",
    "the study in @xcite mainly focused on se and ee of cognitive cellular networks in 5 g mobile communication systems .",
    "also , the authors in @xcite designed energy - efficient optimal sensing strategies and optimal sequential sensing order in multichannel cognitive radio networks .",
    "in addition , the sensing time and transmission duration were jointly optimized in @xcite . several recent studies investigated power allocation / control to maximize the ee in different settings . the authors in @xcite studied the optimal subcarrier assignment and power allocation to maximize either minimum ee among all secondary users or average ee in an ofdm - based cognitive radio network .",
    "moreover , an optimal power loading algorithm was proposed in @xcite to maximize the ee of an ofdm - based cognitive radio system in the presence of imperfect csi of transmission link between secondary transmitter and secondary receiver . in the ee analysis of aforementioned works ,",
    "secondary users are assumed to transmit only when the channel is sensed as idle .",
    "the work in @xcite mainly focused on optimal power allocation to achieve the maximum ee of ofdm - based cognitive radio networks .",
    "also , energy - efficient optimal power allocation in cognitive mimo broadcast channel was studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed iterative algorithms to find the power allocation maximizing the sum ee of secondary users in heterogeneous cognitive two - tier networks .",
    "additionally , the authors in @xcite studied the optimal power allocation and power splitting at the secondary transmitter that maximize the ee of the secondary user as long as a minimum secrecy rate for the primary user is satisfied . in these works",
    ", secondary users always share the spectrum with primary users without performing channel sensing .      unlike all the works mentioned in the previous subsection , in this study we consider a sensing - based spectrum sharing cognitive radio system in which secondary users can coexist with primary user under both idle and busy sensing decisions while adapting the transmission power according to the sensing results . in this setting",
    ", we determine the optimal power allocation schemes to maximize the ee of secondary users under constraints on both the transmission and interference power .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized below :    * we formulate the ee maximization problem subject to peak / average transmit power constraints and peak / average interference constraint in the presence of imperfect sensing results . in particular , ee is defined as the ratio of the achievable rate over the total power expenditure including circuit power consumption .",
    "we explicitly show in the formulations the dependence of the achievable rate and energy efficiency on sensing performance and reliability . * after transforming the ee maximization problem into an equivalent concave form , we apply dinkelbach s method to find the optimal power allocation schemes .",
    "subsequently , we develop an efficient low - complexity power allocation algorithm for given channel fading coefficients of the transmission link between the secondary transmitter - receiver pair and of the interference link between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver .",
    "* we study the impact of different levels of channel knowledge regarding the transmission and interference links on the optimal power allocation and the resulting ee performance of secondary users . in practice ,",
    "perfect csi is difficult to obtain due to the inherently time - varying nature of wireless channels , delay , noise and limited bandwidth in feedback channels and other factors .",
    "therefore , our proposed power allocation schemes obtained under imperfect csi are useful in practical settings and give insight about the impact of channel uncertainty on the system performance . at the same time , the ee in the presence of perfect csi of the transmission and interference links serves as a baseline to compare the performances attained under the assumption of imperfect and statistical csi of both links .",
    "* we also investigate the effects of imperfect sensing decisions , and the constraints on both transmit and interference power on the ee of secondary users .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system_model ] introduces the system model and defines the ee of secondary users in the presence of imperfect sensing results . in section [ sec : opt_power ] , ee maximization problems subject to transmit and interference power constraints in the presence of imperfect sensing results and different levels of csi regarding the transmission and interference links are formulated and the corresponding optimal power allocation schemes are derived .",
    "subsequently , numerical results are presented and discussed in section [ sec : num_results ] before giving the main concluding remarks in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a sensing - based spectrum sharing cognitive radio system in which a secondary transmitter - receiver pair utilizes the spectrum holes in the licensed bands of the primary users .",
    "the term  spectrum holes \" denotes underutilized frequency intervals at a particular time and certain location . in order to detect the spectrum holes ,",
    "secondary users initially perform channel sensing over a duration of @xmath0 symbols .",
    "it is assumed that secondary users employ frames of @xmath1 symbols .",
    "hence , data transmission is performed in the remaining duration of @xmath2 symbols .",
    "spectrum sensing can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem in which there are two hypotheses based on whether primary users are active or inactive over the channel , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "many spectrum sensing methods have been studied in the literature ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) including matched filter detection , energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection .",
    "each method has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "however , all sensing methods are inevitably subject to errors in the form of false alarms and miss detections due to possibly low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) levels of primary users , noise uncertainty , multipath fading and shadowing in wireless channels .",
    "therefore , we consider that spectrum sensing is performed imperfectly with possible errors , and sensing performance depends on the sensing method only through detection and false alarm probabilities . as a result , any sensing method can be employed in the rest of the analysis .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the sensing decisions that the channel is occupied and not occupied by the primary users , respectively .",
    "hence , by conditioning on the true hypotheses , the detection and false - alarm probabilities are defined , respectively , as follows : @xmath7 then , the conditional probabilities of idle sensing decision given the true hypotheses can be expressed as @xmath8      following channel sensing , the secondary users initiate data transmission . the channel is considered to be block flat - fading channel in which the fading coefficients stay the same in one frame duration and vary independently from one frame to another .",
    "secondary users are assumed to transmit under both idle and busy sensing decisions .",
    "therefore , by considering the true nature of the primary user activity together with the channel sensing decisions , the four possible channel input - output relations between the secondary transmitter - receiver pair can be expressed as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 . above , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transmitted and received signals , respectively and @xmath13 is the channel fading coefficient of the transmission link between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver , which is assumed to be gaussian distributed with mean zero and variance @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the additive noise and the primary users received faded signal .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed to be independent and identically distributed circularly - symmetric , zero - mean gaussian sequences with variances @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the transmitted signal indicate the transmission power levels of the secondary users .",
    "more specifically , the average power level is @xmath23 if the channel is detected to be idle while it is @xmath24 if the channel is detected to be busy .",
    "also , @xmath25 denotes the channel fading coefficient of the interference link between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver .",

    "the additive disturbance , @xmath31 , follows a gaussian mixture distribution and the differential entropy of gaussian mixture density does not admit a closed - form expression .",
