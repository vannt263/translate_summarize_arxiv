    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are one of the key drivers of space weather at earth . to account for their effects , one must be able to forecast if a cme will hit earth , as well as the timing and the cme parameters upon impact .",
    "recent efforts have focused on predicting the arrival time of cmes . typically , a cme is observed in a coronagraph field - of - view , and the interplanetary motion is simulated based upon the interaction of the cme with the background solar wind @xcite .",
    "these models tend to yield errors of 6 - 12 hours .",
    "cmes frequently show significant deflections from a purely radial trajectory ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "deflection can cause a high latitude cme to move toward the equator and impact earth @xcite or potentially cause a cme to miss the earth when impact was expected @xcite .",
    "cmes tend to deflect toward the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) and away from coronal holes ( chs , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , magnetic forces have become a popular explanation for the cause of cme deflections @xcite . in the low corona",
    "these forces will `` channel '' cmes towards local null points @xcite and deflect cmes toward the hcs on global scales .",
    "cmes have also been observed to rotate in both observations @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "the rotation changes the orientations of the cme s magnetic field . knowing the direction of the magnetic field is crucial for space weather forecasting as the strength of geomagnetic storms , as measured by @xmath2 , tends to increase with increasing southward magnetic field @xcite .    to begin addressing the questions about cmes relevant to space weather predictions , @xcite developed forecasting a cme s altered trajectory ( forecat ) .",
    "forecat initially addressed cme deflections due to magnetic forces . with recent advancements forecat",
    "is capable of simulating cme rotation as well @xcite .",
    "forecat reproduces the general trends in cme deflections - cmes tend to deflect toward the hcs on global scales , although the magnetic structure in the low corona can also affect the direction of deflection @xcite .",
    "the magnetic forces responsible for forecat s deflection and rotation decay rapidly with distance , which causes the majority of the deflection and rotation to occur near the sun @xcite . beyond 10 @xmath3 a cme s deflection and rotation can be well described by assuming it propagates with constant angular momentum @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that forecat can be used to reproduce observations of individual cmes .",
    "the angular momentum obtained in the low corona determines the behavior of cmes at farther distances @xcite .",
    "therefore it is essential to accurately describe a cme s behavior in the low corona , in particular the radial propagation and expansion of the cme .",
    "however , it is often difficult to distinguish between deflection , rotation , and expansion in the low corona @xcite , many reconstruction techniques assume radial propagation and self - similar expansion ( e.g. @xcite ) . since the deflection depends strongly on the cme s behavior in the low corona @xcite , it is possible to use forecat to probe the validity of different expansion models in the low corona .    in this paper",
    "we compare forecat results with two observed cmes - the 2008 april 10 and the 2012 july 12 cmes .",
    "both cmes were observed by the coronagraphs onboard the twin solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) satellites .",
    "these cmes exhibit very different behavior with the 2008 april 10 cme showing a large deflection and rotation and the 2012 july 12 cme showing almost no non - radial behavior .",
    "for both cases we fit the forecat results to our cme positions , reconstructed from the stereo observations , above 2 @xmath3 and use this fit to place constraints on the cme expansion in the low corona . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe forecat , and in sections 3 and 4 we present our results for the 2008 april 10 and the 2012 july 12 cmes , respectively .",
    "forecat determines the deflection and rotation of a cme based on the magnetic tension and magnetic pressure gradients determined from the background solar magnetic field .",
    "originally forecat determined the motion of a cme cross section within a two - dimensional `` deflection plane '' @xcite . with the most recent version of forecat @xcite the full flux - rope",
    "is represented by a torus that is free to deflect in three dimensions .",
    "the differential deflection forces along the torus cause a rotation about the axis connecting the cme nose and the center of the sun , which changes the cme s tilt .",
    "while observations show that other rotations can occur , they are not currently included in forecat .",
    "forecat also includes the effects of drag in the nonradial direction , which opposes the deflection motion .",
    "currently forecat describes the cme propagation and expansion using simple analytical or empirical models .",
    "the radial speed follows a three - phase propagation model , similar to that presented in @xcite .",
    "the cme initially rises at a constant speed , @xmath4 . at some distance @xmath5",
    "the cme begins accelerating rapidly until it reaches a final speed , @xmath6 , at some distance @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite show that the deflection can be sensitive to the chosen propagation model parameters . in this work",
    "we use the observations to put initial constraints on these values and further constrain them through reduced chi - squared parameter space testing .",
    "typically we assume self - similar expansion for generic cme simulations , as this form of expansion tends to occur beyond 5@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , cmes frequently expand faster than self - similar in the low corona @xcite .",
    "when comparing with specific observed cases , such as in this work , we use an empirical description of the cmes angular width versus distance .",
    "often the expansion is difficult to observe in the low corona but we can constrain this initial behavior through parameter space testing . for",

    "at 3:30 ut on 8 april 2010 a cme erupted from ar 11060 , which was located at n25@xmath0e16@xmath0 as viewed from earth ( 177@xmath0 carrington longitude ) . the polarity inversion line ( pil ) of this active region ( ar )",
    "was tilted  40@xmath0 north of the solar equator . @xcite and @xcite determine the evolution of the magnetic field of the filament , which evolves into the cme , and the surrounding ar .",
    "@xcite find that the filament becomes unstable as the axial flux increases as a result of flux cancellation near the pil of the ar .",
    "as the filament erupts it quickly becomes inclined nearly 45@xmath0 with respect to the solar equator , an effect that can be reproduced with mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "the cme begins propagating radially by the time it reaches the stereo / cor2-a field - of - view ( 2.5 - 15 @xmath3 ) .",

    "as the cme was earth - directed , @xcite use it to test arrival - time prediction models .",
    "we determine the coronal trajectory of this cme using the graduated cylindrical shell ( gcs ) model @xcite .",
    "a separate cme without a strong euv signature erupts more than 40@xmath0 westward of the cme considered in this work .",
    "their separation is sufficient that we can model the evolution of the 2010 april 8 cme without considering their interaction .",
    "however , the two cmes overlap in coronagraph images .",
    "figure [ fig : cgraphs ] shows gcs fits to the cme of interest ( green ) and the other cme ( red ) .        from the gcs fits we determine the radial distance , latitude , longitude , tilt , and angular width of the cme versus distance .",
    "we reconstruct the position of the 2010 april 8 cme between 3:25 and 6:54 ut . in this time the cme propagates radially from 1.8 @xmath3 to 11.6 @xmath3 while deflecting in latitude from -2@xmath0 to -7@xmath0 , and remaining near 187@xmath0 longitude . during this time",
    "the cme maintains a constant tilt of -23@xmath0 and a fixed angular width of 30@xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : cpas ] shows the latitude , longitude , half width , tilt , and radial speed versus radial distance . to determine the radial speed we fit a quadratic polynomial to the radial distance as a function of time .",
    "the radial speed is then determined as the derivative of this polynomial .",
    "we assume the standard 5@xmath0 and 10@xmath0 uncertainties for the latitude and longitude from the gcs fit @xcite .",
    "significant deflection must have occurred below 1.8 @xmath3 as this cme originated at ar 11060 , which is at 25@xmath0 latitude .",
    "while only 5@xmath0 of deflection occurs between 1.8 and 11.6 @xmath3 , the total latitudinal deflection is closer to 30 - 35@xmath0 .",
    "this pattern of the largest deflection occurring close to the sun matches the results of previous forecat simulations @xcite as well as observed cme deflections @xcite .",
    "the ar longitude is within the 10@xmath0 error bars of the reconstructed cme position , so we can not definitively confirm any westward deflection .",

    "we seek to further constrain the initial latitude and longitude using the deflection and rotation .",
    "figure [ fig:1048c1](a ) shows that the the latitudinal @xmath25 has little dependence on the initial cme position , but we see a small dependence on the longitudinal @xmath25 .",
    "the cme rotation , however , is quite sensitive to the initial cme position , allowing us to restrict the initial positions to latitudes less than 26@xmath0 and longitudes greater than 177@xmath0 .",
    "for our best fit we use the initial position closest to the center of the pil .",
    "the middle row of figure [ fig:1048c1 ] shows @xmath25 for different initial cme tilts and background solar wind drag coefficients .",
    "we refer to the initial tilt as the tilt at the beginning of our simulation , which is analogous to the tilt at the beginning of a cme eruption .",

    "figure [ fig:1048c2](a ) and ( b ) show the sensitivity to the initial and final cme speed , @xmath4 and @xmath6 . the latitudinal @xmath25 allows us to put upper and lower bounds on the initial cme velocity .",
    "the range of acceptable initial velocities decreases for faster final velocities .",
    "the rotation has similar behavior , but tighter constraints than the latitudinal @xmath25 .",
    "if the initial speed is too low the cme spends too much time in the strong forces of the low corona , resulting in deflections and rotations larger than observations .",
    "conversley , a high initial speed yields insufficient deflection and rotation . since the majority of the deflection and rotation occurs before the cme reaches its final speed we are unable to constrain it .",
    "figure [ fig:1048c2](c ) and ( d ) show @xmath25 for variations in the radial distances at which the cme transitions from the gradual rise to acceleration phase and from the acceleration to the constant propagation phase , @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "we find very similar behavior to the top panels of figure [ fig:1048c2 ] - a strong sensitivity to the parameter related to the cme behaviour closest to the sun , but little sensitivity to the parameter that determines the motion farther out .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath25 shows almost no sensitivity to these parameters .",
    "the latitudinal @xmath25 and tilt depend strongly on the first transition distance , r@xmath35 , but not significantly on the second transition distance    figure [ fig:1048c3 ] shows results for the parameters of the cme mass and angular width models .",
    "the top row shows the dependence on the initial mass , @xmath17 , and the rate at which the mass increases , @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig:1048c3](a ) and ( b ) shows little variation with nearly the full range corresponding to @xmath25 less than 1.5 . by comparing the final tilt we can narrow the range of plausible parameters .",
    "we find that higher values of @xmath17 require lower values of @xmath16 .",
    "we can eliminate sets of @xmath17 and @xmath16 where both parameters are near the high or low end of our considered region as these lead to either too little or too much rotation .     for the linearly increasing cme mass ( top , initial mass b@xmath36 and rate of increase m@xmath37 ) and exponential angular width models ( bottom , initial width b@xmath38 and increase in width m@xmath38 ) , analogous to figure [ fig:1048c2 ] , width=600 ]    from the observations we know that the cme should have an angular width near 30@xmath0 by the time the nose reaches 2 @xmath3 .",
    "however we have no measurements of the initial size of the cme , or the rate it increases , but we can constrain them from the @xmath25 in figure [ fig:1048c3 ] . the longitudinal @xmath25 shows little sensitivity to the expansion model parameters beyond a region of high @xmath25 for large values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "we can , however , constrain the expansion using the latitudinal @xmath25 and eliminate the extreme sets where both parameters are either large or small . as with the expansion we find that larger values of @xmath11 require smaller values of @xmath10 .",
    "the region of good tilts further constrains the good @xmath25 region , so that for any value of @xmath11 we can constrain @xmath10 within 5@xmath0 .      for nearly all parameters",
    "we find that the longitude @xmath25 shows less variation than the latitudinal @xmath25 , which occurs for two reasons .",
    "first , the longitude has twice the uncertainty of the latitude .",
    "for the same difference between the simulated and reconstructed position the latitudinal @xmath25 will be four times the longitudinal @xmath25 .",
    "second , this cme shows significantly more latitudinal deflection than longitudinal deflection .",
    "parameters related to the cme s speed and mass tend to scale the total deflection , so the effects will be more noticeable in the direction where more deflection occurs .",
    "every parameter , except for the drag coefficient , is more tightly constrained by the rotation than the deflection .",
    "cme deflections and rotations result from both large - scale magnetic gradients , related to the orientation of coronal holes and the heliospheric current sheet , and small - scale gradients related to the local structure of the ar @xcite .",
    "for the 2010 april 8 , cme we suggest that the deflection results predominantly from the large - scale gradients as we see little sensitivity to our free parameters .",
    "these parameters change the position and size of the cme on relatively small scales , and the net effect is averaged out when integrated over the full cme .",
    "the rotation , however , results from the distribution of these magnetic forces along the cme .",
    "this causes the rotation to be much more sensitive to the initial parameters .",
    "in other cases ( see section 4 or @xcite and @xcite ) the local gradients can be important for deflection ( or lack thereof ) , but we expect that even in such cases the rotation will still show greater sensitivity to our initial parameters",
    ". therefore , precisely measuring the rotation of cmes will help us better constrain the early evolution of cmes .",

    "the rapid propagation of this cme , however , nullifies these conditions so that the cme exhibits very little nonradial behavior .      since we have fewer reconstructed points for this cme , and there is little difference , it is more difficult to constrain many of the cme parameters .",

    "the observed longitude can not be reproduced with a cross - sectional width greater than 0.14 times the cme width ( @xmath9 equals the ratio of these values ) , except for large values of @xmath8 that do not reproduce the observed latitude .",
    "this limit on @xmath9 is comparable to the value found for the 2010 april 08 cme .",
    "@xmath8 can not exceed 1.4 for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "this upper limit is reduced to 0.9 for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "the rest of the initial parameters can , at best , be bounded on one side as @xmath25 is less than unity for much of parameter space . from figure [ fig:12712chi](c ) and",
    "( d ) we determine the cme tilt less than 20@xmath0 , but can put no constraints on the background drag coefficient .",
    "the cme mass ( figure [ fig:12712chi](g ) and ( h ) ) must be larger than 10@xmath45 g , but any larger mass is acceptable as this serves to decrease the total deflection . for more massive cmes ,",
    "any initial speed reproduces the results , but a mass as low as 10@xmath45 g requires an initial speed above 80 km s@xmath39 .",
    "the latitudinal @xmath25 yields no constraints on the transition distance for the radial propagation model ( figure [ fig:12712chi](i ) ) , however , from the longitudinal @xmath25 we can constrain @xmath14 , the distance of the transition from the gradual rise phase to the acceleration phase to be less than 1.9 @xmath3 , which is slightly farther than the distance found for the 2010 april 08 cme . both the initial speed and the distance at which the cme begins accelerating determines how much time the cme spends in the low corona , which affects how long it is affected by the strong magnetic forces at these distances .",
    "in this work we consider two different cmes - a very fast cme with little deflection , and a relatively slow cme that exhibits a significant deflection .",
    "forecat can reproduce the trajectory of both cmes . by determining the @xmath25 for hundreds of simulations sampling parameter space we can constrain some of the initial cme parameters that were previously unknown .",
    "in addition to constraining parameters such as the initial cme position , orientation , and shape , we can also constrain the evolution of the cme width , speed , and mass in the low corona . both cmes begin rapidly accelerating by 2 @xmath3 . for the 2008 april 10 cme we can constrain the initial speed before this phase to between 30 km s@xmath39 and 65 km s@xmath39 . both cmes",
    "overexpand in the low corona .",
    "both cmes start with an initial angular width near 10@xmath0 before rapidly expanding .    in both this work and in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we show that forecat can reproduce the observed cme behavior when we provided with the observed propagation and expansion .",
    "predicting the occurrence of cme impacts at earth , and the orientation of the cme s magnetic field is crucial for space weather forecasting .",
    "since it is computationally efficient forecat could potentially be used to simulate a large range of cme parameters and determine the likelihood of cme impacts and the potential magnetic field orientations for any potential cme location , even before a cme occurs .",
    "this , however , requires accurately simulating a cme s propagation and expansion from physical models rather than using the observed values after a cme has occurred .",
    "comparison with observed cases is already shedding light on the cme expansion and propagation in the low corona , and future work will focus on developing these aspects of forecat .",
