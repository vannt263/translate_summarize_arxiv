    "a main theme of this paper is the relation between the _ topological _ structure of a dynamical system and its _ measure - theoretic _ and _ ergodic _ properties . throughout the paper",
    "we shall be concerned with the class @xmath2 of @xmath3 interval maps @xmath4 with negative schwarzian derivative and a finite number of non - flat critical points with possibly different orders , we give the precise definitions in section [ defs ] on page below .",
    "our main result is to show that a sub - class of maps in @xmath5 admit equivalent characterizations in terms of some topological and metric properties of the critical orbits , which in turn imply several ergodic properties such as the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "this subclass is quite abundant in @xmath2 in the sense that general one - parameter families of maps will belong to it for a positive lebesgue measure set of parameters .",
    "a _ physical measure _ for @xmath0 is any ergodic invariant measure @xmath6 with a basin @xmath7 ) of positive lebesgue measure , where @xmath8 , and the limit is in the weak-@xmath9 topology .",
    "maps in @xmath2 can admit various kinds of physical measures such as dirac-@xmath10 measures supported on attracting fixed points or absolutely continuous measures .",
    "there also exist examples for which @xmath0 admits no physical measures at all @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the number of physical measures for maps in @xmath2 is finite and bounded by the number of critical points .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is _",
    "( non - uniformly ) expanding _ if there exists a finite number @xmath11 , @xmath12 , of ergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability measures such that the union of their basins has full lebesgue measure and such that @xmath13 for each @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath16 and so there is only one absolutely continuous invariant probability measure whose basin has full measure and which satisfies . in the general case our results hold for the restriction of @xmath0 to the basins @xmath17 of each ergodic measure @xmath18 .",
    "in fact our results hold for the restriction of @xmath19 to the basin of any ergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability measure satisfying with no additional assumptions on the dynamics outside this basin .",
    "we recall that @xmath4 and @xmath20 are _ topologically conjugate _ , or @xmath21 , if there exists a homeomorphism @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . a topological conjugacy preserves topological properties of maps such as dense and periodic orbits but in principle there is no reason for any measure - theoretic properties such as the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures to be preserved .",
    "we want to address the following question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ suppose that @xmath0 is non - uniformly expanding and that @xmath24 .",
    "does this imply that @xmath1 is non - uniformly expanding ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a counterexample of bruin @xcite shows that the answer is negative in general even in the unimodal case",
    ". however we prove the following    [ generictheorem ] suppose that @xmath0 is non - uniformly expanding , @xmath24 , and that all critical points of @xmath25 are generic with respect to @xmath6 in the sense that @xmath26 then @xmath1 is non - uniformly expanding .",
    "notice that holds for @xmath6 almost all points and in fact , by the absolute continuity of @xmath6 and the assumption that @xmath27 has full lebesgue measure , for lebesgue almost all points .",
    "this justifies thinking of it as a `` generic '' condition .",
    "we remark that the proof does not imply that the conjugacy @xmath28 is absolutely continuous .",
    "rather , it is based on showing that @xmath1 satisfies certain conditions which can be shown by independent arguments to imply that @xmath1 is non - uniformly expanding .",
    "the only existing positive results on the question of the topological invariance of non - uniform expansivity are in the unimodal setting .",
    "the first example of a ( topological class of a ) map with an absolutely continuous invariant measure which is preserved by topological conjugacy was constructed by bruin @xcite , another such class is defined in @xcite .",
    "sands @xcite formulated a ( topological ) condition on the kneading sequence of the map , i.e. the symbolic itinerary of the critical point , and showed that this implied the following condition @xmath29 for the ( single ) critical point @xmath30 ( and this implies non - uniform expansivity , see the next section ) .",
    "notice that is strictly weaker than .",
    "it follows from our results that sands topological condition is actually equivalent to a metric condition which we will call tsujii s condition , to be defined below , and which is strictly stronger than and strictly weaker than .",
    "it was then shown in @xcite that itself is topologically invariant , by bringing together results of previous papers @xcite and observing that these results formed a closed chain of implications which included a condition which is clearly invariant by topological conjugacy .",
    "these result do not however generalize to the multimodal setting : a counterexample was recently constructed in @xcite exhibiting a pair of quasi - symmetrically ( in particular topologically ) conjugate multimodal maps of which one satisfies and the other does not .",
    "we shall show nevertheless that the slightly stronger tsujii condition mentioned above is topologically invariant for completely general multimodal maps .",
    "this condition is satisfied by generic maps .",
    "first we give a more in - depth discussion of condition and its relation to .",
    "condition is more often formulated as @xmath31 it is traditionally known as the collet - eckmann condition since it was first introduced in @xcite and shown , together with some additional conditions which were later shown to be unnecessary @xcite , to imply non - uniform expansivity for unimodal maps .",
    "the generalization of these results to the multimodal setting has been somewhat problematic for various technical reasons and only recently it has been shown that condition assumed to hold for _ every _ critical point does indeed imply non - uniform expansivity , see @xcite for the case when all critical points have the same order and @xcite for the general case .",
    "we remark that in the general multimodal case condition is always satisfied by lebesgue almost every point if @xmath0 is non - uniformly expanding since it is equivalent to which follows from which holds for lebesgue almost every point by and the assumptions on @xmath6 .",
    "this justifies the use of the term _ expanding _ for such a map @xmath19 .",
    "the _ non - uniformity _ follows from the fact that the convergence in is not necessarily uniform and thus in general we have that the constant @xmath32 in is actually a function @xmath33 which depends on @xmath34 and such that @xmath35 : it might be necessary to wait for an arbitrary long time before the exponential behaviour becomes apparent .",
    "the difference between and is quite subtle and does not usually play an important role in many argument which take advantage of the exponential growth property . in our results",
    "however , this distinction will play a very important role .",
    "we shall define below a set of conditions which together fall strictly between and .",
    "the statement in theorem [ generictheorem ] is somewhat unsatisfactory due to the asymmetry between the assumptions and the conclusions : it is not the case in general that the critical points for @xmath1 are generic with respect to the corresponding absolutely continuous invariant measure for @xmath1 .",
    "moreover it does not include some simple , albeit exceptional , cases , such as when the critical points are non - recurrent , which are clearly topologically invariant conditions and are known to imply non - uniform expansivity .",
    "we shall therefore isolate the two main properties of genericity which are actually used in the proof and show that these properties are indeed topologically invariant .",
    "one of these properties is the collet - eckmann condition ( or ) .",
    "the other is a condition on the recurrence to the critical set .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the standard euclidean distance in @xmath37 , let @xmath38 denote the set of critical points of @xmath0 and let @xmath39 for any @xmath40 , let @xmath41 denote a _",
    "metric neighbourhood _ of the critical set .",
    "we say that a ( critical ) point @xmath30 satisfies the _ slow recurrence _ condition if @xmath42 almost every point satisfies since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are uniformly comparable by the non - flatness of the critical points , birkhoff s",
    "ergodic theorem implies that @xmath45 and the integrability condition implies that @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "it is therefore in some sense also a generic condition .",
    "we say that a map satisfies condition ce if all its critical points satisfy the collet - eckmann condition and sr if all its critical points satisfy the slow recurrence conditions .",
    "we are now ready to state our main result .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 satisfies both ce and sr .",
    "then every map @xmath1 topologically conjugate to @xmath0 also satisfies both ce and sr .",
    "thus the simultaneous occurrence of both conditions ce and sr is topologically invariant .",
    "we stress the fact that neither ce nor sr on their own are topologically invariant .",
    "the measure - theoretical abundance of multimodal maps satisfying conditions ce and sr simultaneously was proved by tsujii @xcite for quite general families of multimodal maps , building on a theme of proving the abundance of maps satisfying various kinds of expansivity and recurrence conditions , all aimed at ultimately implying some form of non - uniform expansivity @xcite .",
    "we mention also that non - uniformly expanding maps are in general very structurally unstable in the sense that arbitrarily small perturbations which do not preserve the topological structure of the map can destroy the expansivity , see @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that tsujii s conditions might play a similar role in the multimodal setting to that played by the collet - eckmann conditions in the unimodal case .",
    "several recent counterexamples show that some key properties of unimodal ce maps do not extend to the multimodal setting ; perhaps these counterexamples may be overcome by assuming tsujii s conditions instead .",
    "our main theorem is precisely an example in which this is the case .",
    "our arguments also indicate possible strategies for proving other technical properties for maps satisfying tsujii s conditions , such as _ backward collet - eckmann _ which is equivalent to ce in the unimodal case @xcite but does _ not _ follow from straightforward ce in the multimodal case @xcite , _ bounded backward contraction _ and _ exponential decay of correlations _ proved in @xcite and @xcite respectively for ce multimodal maps under the additional assumption that all critical points have the same order .",
    "counterexamples exist showing that bounded backward contraction may fail for ce maps with critical points of different order @xcite .",
    "these properties will be investigated in future papers .",
    "our approach is quite distinct from the proof in @xcite of the invariance of the ce condition in the unimodal case .",
    "the present strategy is more direct and in the spirit of sands thesis @xcite in which , in the unimodal setting , a topological condition is formulated in terms of the kneading sequence of the critical point and this condition is shown to imply the collet - eckmann condition .",
    "the relation between sands topological condition and our slow recurrence condition was studied in @xcite in the unimodal case , and a generalization of the topological condition given in the bimodal case in @xcite . here",
    "we push this whole approach significantly further by giving a more general definition of this condition which in particular applies to the multimodal setting , we call it a topological slow recurrence ( tsr ) condition , see on page . by construction",
    "this condition is topologically invariant and thus our main result follows from proving the double implication    for any @xmath48 we have @xmath49      in section [ combinatorial ] we give all the details of the combinatorial structure and define condition tsr .",
    "we give a brief summary of the key ideas here .",
    "the critical set @xmath38 defines a partition @xmath50 of @xmath51 which allows us to define a symbolic itinerary for all points which are not preimages of @xmath38 and to define cylinder sets made up of points which share the same itinerary up to some finite time .",
    "the whole structure of cylinder sets is topological .",
    "there is then a natural _ topological _ separation time : any point @xmath34 near @xmath52 shadows the orbit of the critical point for a time defined by the number of iterates for which @xmath34 and @xmath30 have the same symbolic itinerary .",
    "this shadowing time tends to @xmath53 as @xmath34 tends to @xmath30 . in particular the symbolic sequence associated to any given point",
    "contains information about its pattern of recurrence to the critical set : if it contains long finite blocks which coincide with long initial blocks of the symbolic sequences of one of the critical point then it must have come quite close to the critical set .",
    "this simple idea is used in a crucial way in the definition of the condition tsr .    in the remaining three sections we proceed to prove the three steps required to show .",
    "we first show that ce + sr implies tsr , then that tsr implies sr and finally that tsr implies ce .",
    "a particular effort has been made here to make the presentation as self - contained as possible and as much as possible independent of specialized technical notation and constructions familiar mainly to established specialists in one - dimensional dynamics .      before ending this section",
    "we give the formal definition of the class @xmath2 of maps under consideration and fix some fairly standard notation and definitions .",
    "we shall consider _ s - multimodal maps with non - flat critical points _ by which we mean maps @xmath0 satisfying the following conditions .",
    "let @xmath54 be a @xmath55 map , where @xmath56 is a closed interval .",
    "we shall assume without loss of generality that @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we call @xmath58 a critical point of @xmath59 if @xmath60",
    ". denote by @xmath61 the set of all critical points .",
    "@xmath59 has finite number ( say @xmath62 ) of _ non - flat critical points _",
    "@xmath63 if there exist @xmath64 , @xmath65 and a neighbourhood @xmath66 of @xmath67 in which @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath59 has _ negative schwarzian derivative _ , i.e. @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "we remark that this condition implies in particular the non - existence of any inflection points .",
    "thus all critical points are turning points , i.e. points at which the maps fails to be a local homeomorphism .",
    "as part of the argument we shall need to obtain some derivative estimates about the iterates of @xmath0 along the forward orbit of the critical values . if these orbits map to a periodic point then the estimates are easily obtained .",
    "otherwise we need to consider a two - sided neighbourhood of each critical value and the forward images of this neighbourhood .",
    "we assume therefore that the forward orbits of all the critical points are disjoint from the boundary of @xmath37 or , if not , that the boundaries of @xmath37 are fixed points .",
    "this is not restrictive since , if it is not the case , we can extend @xmath0 to a map @xmath71 defined on neighbourhood @xmath72 of @xmath37 such that the forward orbits of all the critical points are disjoint from the boundary of @xmath72 and the dynamics on @xmath37 is unaffected .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the combinatorial structure associated to any s - multimodal map with non - flat critical points and having no neutral or attracting periodic orbits .",
    "we emphasize that everything we describe here relies on no other assumptions .",
    "some of the definitions are closely related to the so - called _ cutting / co - cutting times _ used in @xcite for unimodal maps ; we give a generalization to the multimodal setting and , we believe , a simplification of the way those concepts are introduced and applied .",
    "we fix for the rest of the paper a constant @xmath73 sufficiently small so that the critical neighbourhood @xmath74 has precisely @xmath75 disjoint connected components ; in particular any @xmath76 for @xmath77 is associated unambiguously to one particular critical point . for any @xmath34 we shall use the notation @xmath78 , especially , @xmath79 for a critical point @xmath80 .",
    "the critical points define a natural partition @xmath81 of @xmath37 into @xmath82 subintervals .",
    "this allows us to associate a symbolic _ itinerary _ to any point not in the preimage of a critical point by letting @xmath83 for convenience we associate to each critical point two sequences which differ only in the first term , so that we think of the partition elements as closed intervals and think of each critical point as belonging to both of the adjacent intervals .",
    "we define the symbolic _ separation time _ between two points as @xmath84 as long as the itineraries @xmath85 and @xmath86 are both defined .",
    "if @xmath87 is a critical point and @xmath34 is in one of the adjacent partition elements then we naturally consider the symbolic itinerary for @xmath30 for which @xmath88 .",
    "in particular we define the time it takes for a point @xmath34 to `` separate '' from the critical set @xmath52 by @xmath89 notice that @xmath90 as @xmath91 .",
    "we define _ topological neighbourhoods _",
    "@xmath92 of the critical set @xmath93 by @xmath94 we fix a constant @xmath95 sufficiently large so that @xmath96 recall , and such that every point @xmath34 with @xmath97 is associated to some particular critical point @xmath30 and @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    for",

    ". clearly @xmath110 for any @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , by the non - existence of wandering intervals @xcite the preimages of the critical set are dense and therefore we have @xmath112 in particular the cylinder sets @xmath113 define a nested sequence of neighbourhoods of the point @xmath107 .",

    "we index the times at which case 2 above occurs by two sequences @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 for a general point @xmath34 , the two sequences @xmath132 and @xmath133 are independent even though there may well be one or more pairs @xmath134 such that @xmath135 . for the special case of the partition @xmath136 associated to one of the critical points @xmath137",
