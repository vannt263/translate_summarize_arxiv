    "the paper aims at the development of an apparatus for analysis and construction of near optimal solutions of singularly perturbed ( sp ) optimal controls problems ( that is , problems of optimal control of sp systems ) considered on the infinite time horizon .",
    "we mostly focus on problems with time discounting criteria but a possibility of the extension of results to periodic optimization problems is discussed as well .",
    "our consideration is based on earlier results on averaging of sp control systems and on linear programming formulations of optimal control problems .",
    "the idea that we exploit is to first asymptotically approximate a given problem of optimal control of the sp system by a certain averaged optimal control problem , then reformulate this averaged problem as an infinite - dimensional ( i d ) linear programming ( lp ) problem , and then approximate the latter by semi - infinite lp problems .",
    "we show that the optimal solution of these semi - infinite lp problems and their duals ( that can be found with the help of a modification of an available lp software ) allow one to construct near optimal controls of the sp system .",
    "we will be considering the sp system written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a small parameter ; @xmath2 are continuous vector functions satisfying lipschitz conditions in @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; and where controls @xmath5 are measurable functions of time satisfying the inclusion @xmath6 @xmath7 being a given compact metric space . the system ( [ e : intro-0 - 1])-([e : intro-0 - 2 ] )",
    "will be considered with the initial condition @xmath8 we are assuming that all solutions of the system obtained with this initial condition satisfy the inclusion @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a compact subset of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a compact subset of @xmath13 ( the consideration is readily extendable to the case when only optimal and near optimal solutions satisfy ( [ equ - y ] ) ) .",
    "we will be mostly dealing with the problem of optimal control @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a continuous function , @xmath16 is a discount rate , and @xmath17 is sought over all controls and the corresponding solutions of ( [ e : intro-0 - 1])-([e : intro-0 - 2 ] ) that satisfy the initial condition([e - initial - sp ] ) .",
    "however , the approach that we are developing is applicable to other classes of sp optimal control problems as well . to demonstrate this point , we will indicate a way how results obtained for the problem with time discounting criterion ( [ vy - perturbed ] ) can be extended to the periodic optimization setting , and we will consider an example of a sp periodic optimization problem which is numerically solved with the help of the proposed technique .    the presence of @xmath18 in the system ( [ e : intro-0 - 1])-([e : intro-0 - 2 ] ) ) implies that the rate with which the @xmath4-components of the state variables change their values is of the order @xmath19 and is , therefore , much higher than the rate of changes of the @xmath3-components ( since @xmath18 is assumed to be small ) .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath4-components and @xmath3-components of the state variables are referred to as _ fast _ and _ slow _ , respectively .    problems of optimal controls of singularly perturbed systems appear in a variety of applications and have received a great deal of attention in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a most common approach to such problems is based on the idea of approximating the slow @xmath3-components of the solutions of the sp system ( [ e : intro-0 - 1])-([e : intro-0 - 2 ] ) by the solutions of the so - called reduced system @xmath20 which is obtained from ( [ e : intro-0 - 1 ] ) via the replacement of @xmath21 by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the root of the equation @xmath24 note that the equation ( [ e : red-2 ] ) can be obtained by formally equating @xmath18 to zero in ( [ e : intro-0 - 1 ] ) .",
    "being very efficient in dealing with many important classes of optimal control problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , this approach may not be applicable in the general case ( see examples in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the validity of the assertion that the system ( [ e : red-1 ] ) can be used for finding a near optimal control of the sp system ( [ e : intro-0 - 1])-([e : intro-0 - 2 ] ) is related to the validity of the hypothesis that the optimal control of the latter is in some sense slow and that ( in the optimal or near optimal regime ) the fast state variables converge rapidly to their quasi steady states defined by the root of ( [ e : red-2 ] ) and remain in a neighborhood of this root , while the slow variables are changing in accordance with ( [ e : red-1 ] ) . while the validity of such a hypothesis has been established under natural stability conditions by famous tichonov s theorem in the case of uncontrolled dynamics ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , this hypothesis may not be valid in the control setting if the dynamics is nonlinear and/or the objective function is non - convex , the reason for this being the fact that the use of rapidly oscillating controls may lead to significant ( not tending to zero with @xmath25 ) improvements of the performance indexes .",
    "various averaging type approaches allowing one to deal with the fact that the optimal or near optimal controls can take the form of rapidly oscillating functions have been proposed and studied by a number of researchers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this collective effort lead to a good understanding of what the true limit \" problems , optimal solutions of which approximate optimal solutions of the sp problems with small @xmath25 , are .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no algorithms for finding such approximating solutions ( in case fast oscillations may lead to a significant improvement of the performance ) have been discussed in the literature . in this paper , we fill this gap by developing an apparatus for construction of such algorithms , our development being based on results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite establishing the equivalence of optimal control problems to certain idlp problems ( related results on linear programming formulations of optimal control problems in both deterministic and stochastic settings can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "it consists of five parts .",
    "part i ( sections [ sec - contents ] - [ sec - preliminaries ] ) is introductory .",
    "section [ sec - contents ] is this description of the contents of the paper . in section [ sec - two - examples ] , we consider two examples of sp optimal control problems , in which fast oscillations lead to improvements of the performance indexes . near optimal solutions of these problems obtained with the proposed technique",
    "are exhibited later in the text ( section [ sec - construction - sp - examples ] ) . in section [ sec - preliminaries ]",
    "some notations and definitions used in the paper are introduced .",
    "in part ii ( sections [ sec - augm - reduced ] and [ sec - ave - aug ] ) , we build a foundation for the subsequent developments by considering two problems that describe an asymptotic behavior of the idlp problem related to the sp optimal control problem ( [ vy - perturbed ] ) .",
    "one is the augmented reduced idlp problem obtained via adding some extra constraints to the problem resulted from equating of the small parameter to zero ( section [ sec - augm - reduced ] ) and the other is the averaged \" idlp problem , which is related to the averaged problem of optimal control ( section [ sec - ave - aug ] ) .",
    "we show that these two problems are equivalent and that both of them characterize the limit behavior of the sp problem when @xmath26 provided that the slow dynamics of the sp system is approximated by the averaged system on finite time intervals ( see definition [ def - average - approximation ] and propositions [ prop - ave - disc ] , [ prop - ave - disc-1 ] , [ prop - sp-2 ] , [ prop - present-3 ] ) .",
    "in part iii ( sections [ sec - acg - nec - opt ] - [ sec - acg - construction ] ) , we introduce the concept of an average control generating ( acg ) family ( the key building block of the paper ) , and we use duality results for idlp problems involved and their semi infinite approximations to characterize and construct optimal and near optimal acg families .",
    "more specifically , in section [ sec - acg - nec - opt ] , the definitions of an acg family and of optimal/ near optimal acg families are given ( definitions [ def - acg ] and [ def - acg - opt ] ) . also in this section , averaged and associated dual problems are introduced and a necessary optimality condition for an acg family to be optimal is established under the assumption that solutions of these duals exist ( proposition [ prop - necessary - opt - cond ] ) . in section [ n - approx - dual - opt ] , approximating averaged semi infinite lp problem and the corresponding approximating averaged and associated dual problems are introduced . in section [ sec - existence - controllability ]",
    "it is proved that solutions of these approximating dual problems exist under natural controllability conditions ( propositions [ prop - existence - disc ] and [ dual - existence - average ] ) . in section [ sec - acg - construction ] , it is established that solutions of the approximating averaged and associated dual problems can be used for construction of near optimal acg families ( theorem [ main - sp - nemeric ] ) .",
    "in part iv ( sections [ sec - sp - acg - theorem ] - [ sec - lp - based - algorithm ] ) , we indicate a way how asymptotically optimal ( near optimal ) controls of sp problems can be constructed on the basis of optimal ( near optimal ) acg families . in section",
    "[ sec - sp - acg - theorem ] , we describe the construction of a control of the sp system based on an acg family and establish its asymptotic optimality / near optimality if the acg family is optimal / near optimal ( theorem [ prop - convergence - measures - discounted ] and corollary [ cor - asym - near - opt ] ) . in section [ sec - construction - sp - examples ]",
    ", we discuss the process of construction of asymptotically near optimal controls using solutions of the approximating averaged and associated dual problems , and we illustrate the construction with two numerical examples .",
    "a linear programming based algorithm allowing one to find solutions of approximating averaged problem and solutions of the corresponding approximating ( averaged and associated ) dual problems numerically is outlined in section [ sec - lp - based - algorithm ] .",
    "part v ( sections [ sec - phi - map ] - [ sec - main - ave ] ) contains some technical proofs .",
    "namely , the proofs of propositions [ prop - ave - disc ] and [ prop - sp-2 ] are given in section [ sec - phi - map ] , and the proofs of theorems [ main - sp - nemeric ] and [ prop - convergence - measures - discounted ] are given in sections [ sec - main - main ] and [ sec - main - ave ] , respectively .",
    "example 1 . consider the optimal control problem @xmath27 with minimization being over the controls @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the corresponding solutions @xmath30 of the sp system @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 by taking @xmath35 in ( [ e : ex-4 - 2-repeat ] ) , one obtains that @xmath36 and , thus , arrives at the equality @xmath37 which makes the slow dynamics uncontrolled and leads to the equality @xmath38 .",
    "the latter , in turn , implies that @xmath39 to see that this value is not even approximately optimal for small but non - zero @xmath25 , let us consider the controls @xmath40 .",
    "the solution of the sp system ( [ e : ex-4 - 2-repeat ] ) , ( [ e : ex-4 - 1-rep ] ) obtained with this control can be verified to be of the form @xmath41 with the slow state variable @xmath42 decreasing in time and reaching zero at the moment @xmath43 . the value of the objective function obtained with using these controls until the moment when the slow component reaches zero and with applying zero controls \" after that moment is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , in the given example , @xmath45    controls @xmath46 and the corresponding state components @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( that are verified to be near optimal \" in the given example ) have been numerically constructed with the help of proposed technique for @xmath49 ( see figures 1,2,3 and 7 in section [ sec - construction - sp - examples ] ) and for @xmath50 ( see figures 4,5,6 and 8 in section [ sec - construction - sp - examples ] ) .",
    "the corresponding values of the objective function obtained with these two values of @xmath25 are approximately equal to @xmath51 and to @xmath52 ( respectively ) .",
    "example 2 .",
    "assume that the fast dynamics and the controls are as in example 1 ( that is , they are described by ( [ e : ex-4 - 1-rep-1 - 0 ] ) and ( [ e : ex-4 - 2-repeat ] ) ) .",
    "assume that the slow dynamics is two - dimensional and is described by the equations @xmath53 with @xmath54 consider the periodic optimization problem @xmath55 where minimization is over the length of the time interval @xmath56 and over the controls @xmath57 defined on this interval subject to the periodicity conditions : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "as in example 1 , equating @xmath18 to zero leads to ( [ e : ex-4 - 1-rep-1 ] ) , which makes the slow dynamics uncontrollable .",
    "the optimal periodic solution of ( [ e : ex-4 - 1-rep-101 - 1 ] ) in this case is the trivial \" steady state one : @xmath60 , which leads one to the conclusion that @xmath61 .",
    "note that the slow subsystem \" ( [ e : ex-4 - 1-rep-101 - 1 ] ) is equivalent to the second order differential equation @xmath62 that describes a linear oscillator influenced by the controls and the fast state variables .",
    "one can expect , therefore , that , if , due to a combined influence of the latter , some sort of resonance oscillations of the slow state variables are achievable , then the value of the objective can be negative ( see example 1 in @xcite ) . this type of a near optimal oscillatory regime ( with rapid oscillations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 and with slow oscillations of @xmath63 ) was obtained with the use of the proposed technique .",
    "the images of state trajectories constructed numerically for @xmath50 and @xmath64 are depicted in figures 9 and 10 in section [ sec - construction - sp - examples ] .",
    "the values of the objective function for these two cases are approximately equal @xmath65 .",
    "given a compact metric space @xmath66 , @xmath67 will stand for the @xmath68-algebra of its borel subsets and @xmath69 will denote the set of probability measures defined on @xmath67 .",
    "the set @xmath69 will always be treated as a compact metric space with a metric @xmath70 , which is consistent with its weak@xmath71 topology .",

    "there are many ways of how such a metric @xmath70 can be defined . in this paper",
