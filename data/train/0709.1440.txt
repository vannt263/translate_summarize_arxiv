    "one of the most fundamental properties of a system of star clusters is its mass function , defined here such that @xmath4 is the number of clusters with masses between @xmath5 and @xmath6 [ i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "there is currently a debate about whether the shape of the mass function of old globular clusters primarily reflects dynamical evolution ( fall & zhang 2001 ) or initial conditions ( vesperini et al .",
    "a key observation here is that the turnover or peak of @xmath8 at @xmath9 is nearly `` universal , '' varying little among galaxies of different masses and types and from one location to another within galaxies ( harris 2001 ) .",
    "interpreted naively , these facts tend to favor the scenario in which the present shape of @xmath8 was imprinted when the clusters formed or were relatively young . on the other hand , the observed shape @xmath10 below @xmath3 is a clear signature of long - term dynamical evolution driven by internal two - body relaxation ( fall & zhang 2001 ; waters et al .",
    "2006 ; jordn et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "another signature of relaxation - driven evolution , recently emphasized by mclaughlin & fall ( 2007 , hereafter mf07 ) , is that the peak mass should be higher in subsamples of clusters with greater internal densities and thus higher evaporation rates .",
    "the expected dependence is roughly @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mean density within the median ( i.e. , half - mass ) radius @xmath13 .",
    "mf07 found essentially this dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 for the old globular clusters in the milky way , and they argued that this , together with the observation @xmath14 for @xmath15 , provided compelling evidence for the scenario in which dynamical evolution determines the present shape of @xmath8 .    in this letter , we report on a similar study of the old globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy ( m104 , ngc 4594 ) . our goal is to check whether the mf07 findings apply only to the clusters in the milky way or are representative of the clusters in other galaxies .",
    "we use the published measurements by spitler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) of the luminosities and effective radii of the globular clusters in images taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ as part of the hubble heritage program ( go-9714 ) .",
    "the sombrero galaxy is ideal for this project because it has a large retinue of clusters ( @xmath16 ) , nearly all them are resolved in the acs images , and there is relatively little contamination by the disk .",
    "the acs images are arranged in a @xmath17 mosaic with overall angular dimensions of @xmath18 , corresponding to @xmath19 at the adopted 9.0  mpc distance of the sombrero galaxy .",
    "the images are moderately deep ; for each pointing , four integrations of 675  s , 500  s , and 350  s were made with the f435w ( @xmath20 ) , f555w ( @xmath21 ) , and f625w ( @xmath1 ) filters , respectively .",
    "spitler et al . ( 2006 ) selected candidate globular clusters based on the following criteria : _ ( i ) _ integrated colors in the ranges @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; _ ( ii ) _ apparent @xmath21 magnitude brighter than 24.3 ( roughly the 95% completeness limit ) ; _ ( iii ) _ angular extent at least 0.3  pixels wider than the point - spread function ( psf ) ; _ ( iv ) _ ellipticity less than 0.5 ; _ ( v ) _ location outside the dust lane ; and _ ( vi ) _ visual appearance more like a globular cluster than a star or galaxy .",
    "this produced a sample of 659 candidate globular clusters that is believed to be nearly complete brighter than @xmath24 and nearly free from contamination by foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "spitler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) present the magnitudes , effective ( i.e. , half - light ) radii @xmath25 , and projected galactocentric distances @xmath1 of all the clusters in their sample . and",
    "@xmath1 are denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 in table  2 of spitler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . ]",
    "we estimate the mass of each cluster from @xmath28 , with the total @xmath21-band luminosity @xmath29 ( after correction for galactic interstellar extinction ) and the adopted mass - to - light ratio @xmath30 ( a typical value for old globular clusters in the milky way ; see mclaughlin 2000 ) .",
    "we estimate the internal half - mass density from the definition @xmath31 and the standard 3d-2d conversion , @xmath32 ( neglecting any internal mass / light segregation ; see spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the main results of this paper : the mass function of the globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy in three bins of internal half - mass density @xmath0 ( left - hand panels ) and three bins of projected galactocentric distance @xmath1 ( right - hand panels ) .",
    "we plot @xmath33 rather than @xmath34 for ease of comparison with the more familiar magnitude distributions . based on the tests described below ,",
    "we exclude the 59 clusters with either @xmath35 or @xmath36 ( 2.1  kpc ) , because the sample becomes less complete at low internal densities ( for any @xmath1 ) and small galactocentric distances ( for any @xmath0 ) .",
    "the mass functions plotted here show the familiar single - peaked shape .",
    "what is striking , however , is that the peak mass increases from @xmath37 in the low-@xmath0 bin , to @xmath38 in the middle-@xmath0 bin , to @xmath39 in the high-@xmath0 bin . at the same time",
    ", the peak mass remains roughly constant at @xmath40 for all three @xmath1 bins .",
    "both of these results have high statistical significance and are similar to the mf07 findings for the globular clusters in the milky way ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "we have replotted figure  1 with many different binnings in @xmath5 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , and always recover the same result  that @xmath3 increases with @xmath0 but is nearly constant with @xmath1to within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we have also made diagrams like figure  1 for subsamples of clusters divided by color at @xmath41 and find only minor differences .",
    "this is relevant because the globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy , like those in many other galaxies , have a bimodal distribution of colors .",
    "it is believed that the red , metal - rich clusters ( @xmath42 ) are somewhat younger than the blue , metal - poor clusters ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the spectra of several red and blue clusters indicate , however , that they are all old , with ages that differ by less than 3  gyr from each other and from the ages of globular clusters in the milky way ( larsen et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we have also made independent measurements of the magnitudes and effective radii of all the clusters in the spitler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample .",
    "our procedure is similar to theirs , with only two minor differences : our measurements of @xmath21 include @xmath25-dependent aperture corrections and our measurements of @xmath25 are from the @xmath21-band images alone .",
    "both sets of measurements are generally in good agreement , the mean offset ( us minus spitler et al . ) and rms scatter being only 0.06 and 0.03 in @xmath21 and 0.04 and 0.07 in @xmath44 .",
    "these small deviations are at the levels expected for the slightly different procedures . as another check , we have inserted artificial clusters with specified properties into the @xmath21-band images and measured them in the same way as the real clusters .",
    "these experiments indicate that the uncertainties in @xmath21 and @xmath25 increase , while the completeness of the sample decreases , for diffuse clusters ( @xmath45 ) and those near the galactic center ( @xmath36 ) . we have imposed these restrictions on @xmath0 and @xmath1 in most of our analysis ( as noted above ) , but we have confirmed that the relations between @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are nearly identical in the full spitler et al . sample . finally , we have repeated the entire analysis using only our measurements of @xmath21 and @xmath25 , and find results that are practically indistinguishable from those based on the spitler et al .",
    "these checks give us confidence in our claim that @xmath3 has a significant dependence on @xmath0 but not @xmath1 .",
    "in this section , we explore the implications of the results displayed in figure 1 . as we have already noted , the peak of the mass function @xmath3 is a factor of about 4 higher in the bottom left - hand panel than in the top left - hand panel , while the median internal density @xmath0 within these subsamples increases by a factor of about 13 .",
    "this is close to the expected scaling @xmath46 for relaxation - driven evolution , although the comparison is necessarily crude because the range of @xmath0 included in each of the panels is large .",
    "the puzzle of why @xmath3 has little or no dependence on projected galactocentric distance @xmath1 is explained by figure  2 , a plot of @xmath0 against @xmath1 for all clusters in the sample . evidently , there is a huge scatter and only a mild ( anti)correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , thus accounting nicely for the weak dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 despite the relatively strong dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 .",
    "( see fig .  1 of mf07 for the analogous situation in the milky way .",
    ")    to make a more precise and informative comparison , we follow the procedure developed by mf07 , which in turn is based on the simple ( `` classical '' ) model for the escape of stars from tidally limited clusters driven by internal relaxation alone ( see section 3.2 of spitzer 1987 and references therein ) . in this model , the mass of each cluster decreases linearly with time , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the initial mass and @xmath49 is the constant rate of mass loss ( @xmath50 being the half - mass relaxation time ) . for a population of clusters with the same internal density @xmath0 and age @xmath51 ,",
    "the present and initial mass functions are related by @xmath52 ( fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "this implies that the present mass function will have a peak at @xmath53 , a low - mass shape @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) , and a high - mass shape @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) .    for the initial mass function ,",
    "we adopt the schechter ( 1976 ) distribution , @xmath56 , with a power - law exponent @xmath57 and an exponential cutoff at @xmath58 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the observed power - law shape of the mass function of young clusters in the antennae galaxies , @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( zhang & fall 1999 ) , and the fact that the mass functions of old globular clusters in many galaxies decrease more rapidly than a power law for @xmath61 ( burkert & smith 2000 ; jordn et al .",
    "we assume this mass function holds at some `` initial '' time , near the formation epoch but after a brief period of `` infant mortality '' caused by the activity of massive stars ( photoionization , winds , jets , supernovae ) , since we are concerned here only with the long - term dynamical evolution of the clusters . in our model",
    ", this evolution flattens much of the power - law part of @xmath62 ( for @xmath15 ) but preserves the exponential part .",
    "thus , fortunately , most of our results are not sensitive to our assumed initial conditions .",
    "the mass function for a population of clusters with a range of internal densities is just the sum of the mass functions for the clusters of each density . from the relations above",
    ", we obtain a formula equivalent to equation ( 3 ) of mf07 : @xmath63.\\ ] ] here , @xmath64 is the mass lost over the lifetime of a cluster , @xmath65 is the required normalization constant for each term ( @xmath66 being an exponential integral ) , and the sum is over all clusters in the population .",
    "this model is based on the same dynamical evolution and initial conditions as the fall - zhang ( 2001 ) model , but the internal densities of clusters are no longer coupled to their orbits and hence to assumptions about the space and time dependence of the galactic potential .",
    "thus , equation ( 1 ) is equally valid for spherical and triaxial , static and evolving potentials .",
    "we have computed @xmath67 from equation  ( 1 ) and plotted the results in figure  1 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 in the mass - loss formula @xmath68 was determined as follows .",
    "we first fitted a model with a single term in equation  ( 1)an `` evolved schechter function '' in the nomenclature of jordn et al .",
    "( 2007)to the mass function for the full sample of 600 clusters .",
    "the minimum @xmath69 occurs for @xmath70 and hence @xmath71 for @xmath72  gyr .",
    "associating this rate of mass loss with the median internal density of clusters in the full sample , @xmath73 , gives @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting `` average '' mass function for the globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy is plotted as the dashed curve in each of the six panels of figure  1 .",
    "this is very similar to the corresponding function derived by the same procedure by mf07 for the globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "we next computed the mass functions for the three @xmath0 bins and three @xmath1 bins from equation  ( 1 ) with a separate term for each cluster . in doing so",
    ", we used the same coefficient @xmath74 derived above for the whole sample to relate the individual values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the results are plotted as the solid curves in figure  1 .",
    "these provide good ( although not perfect ) representations of the observed mass functions , with generally similar shapes and peaks at about the right masses . in particular , the model @xmath3 increases by a factor of about 3 between the low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 bins , while remaining almost constant for the different @xmath1 bins .",
    "the first of these relations is slightly weaker than @xmath46 because of the exponential cutoff at @xmath77 .",
    "is exact in the limit @xmath78 ( mf07 ) . ]",
    "the observed mass function is slightly narrower or more sharply peaked than the model curves , especially in the left - hand panels of figure 1 .",
    "one factor that might contribute to this is residual incompleteness for faint ( i.e. , low - mass ) clusters , particularly in the lowest - density bin .",
    "another is our simplifying assumption that all clusters have the same mass - to - light ratio . in reality",
    ", there will be a distribution of @xmath79 , and this will broaden the mass function somewhat relative to the luminosity function [ which we have adopted as a proxy for @xmath8 ] . a more speculative possibility that would further improve the fits is that the cutoff @xmath81 in the initial mass function might increase slightly with @xmath0 instead of remaining fixed as we have assumed here . in any case , it is clear from figure  1 that our simple , relaxation - driven model captures the essential features of the observed mass function even without these adjustments .",
    "our findings for the globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy corroborate those of mf07 for the globular clusters in the milky way . the sombrero sample is larger ( @xmath82 vs @xmath83 ) but , because of the modest sensitivity to extended sources and the restricted angular extent of the _ hst _ observations , it covers smaller ranges of internal density ( @xmath84 vs @xmath85 ) and galactocentric distance ( @xmath86  kpc vs @xmath87  kpc ) . in both galaxies ,",
    "the peak of the mass function increases with internal density  approximately as @xmath46but remains nearly constant with galactocentric distance .",
    "these relations are consistent with each other because @xmath0 correlates only weakly with @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we now see that whether the peak mass appears `` universal '' depends crucially on one s perspective . in terms of galactocentric distance",
    ", it may be ; but in terms of internal density , the more physically meaningful quantity , it certainly is not .",
    "we have interpreted these observations in the context of a simple , approximate model in which clusters form with a schechter initial mass function and are subsequently disrupted by stellar escape driven by internal two - body relaxation .",
    "our model predicts present mass functions similar to the observed ones , including the correct dependence on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we compute mass - loss rates and hence @xmath8 directly from the observed @xmath0 , and only then do we use the observed @xmath0 @xmath1 distribution to reexpress @xmath8 in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "our approach completely avoids having to specify the @xmath0@xmath1 distribution in the past and thus sidesteps the interesting but difficult problem of explaining physically how the present @xmath0@xmath1 distribution came about ( which ultimately will require a detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of both galaxies and star clusters ) .",
    "instead , we assume only that the present @xmath0 of extant clusters are good guides to their past @xmath0 and thus to their average mass - loss rates over a hubble time . for a more complete discussion of these issues",
    ", we refer the interested reader to mf07 .",
    "most previous models link the internal densities and hence the mass - loss rates of clusters to their orbits in static , spherical galactic potentials ( adopted for analytical simplicity ) . to account for the observed weak radial gradient in the mass functions of globular clusters ,",
    "these models are forced to have orbital distributions with strong radial anisotropy at large galactocentric distances , possibly more than is allowed by observations in the milky way ( fall & zhang 2001 ) and certainly more than allowed in m87 ( vesperini et al .",
    "however , as fall & zhang ( 2001 ) have emphasized , these conclusions are primarily a consequence of the simplifying assumptions about the galactic potential , not the underlying premise about the disruption of clusters . in more realistic models ,",
    "galaxies form and evolve by a hierarchical series of collisions , mergers , and other accretion events .",
    "galactic potentials in this case are time - dependent and non - spherical , and the orbital energies and angular momenta of clusters are not conserved .",
    "the orbits and positions of clusters are rearranged many times and any initial gradients in @xmath3 or @xmath0 are inevitably weakened if not eliminated , consistent with the observations plotted in figures  1 and 2 . by comparison ,",
    "the idealized models with static , spherical potentials overpredict gradients in @xmath3 and @xmath0 and therefore represent a limiting ( i.e. , `` worst - case '' ) scenario .",
    "our results also have an important bearing on recent attempts to infer the initial form of the mass function of globular clusters .",
    "vesperini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have advocated a gaussian - like or lognormal initial mass function with a built - in peak near @xmath88 to account for the observed shape and weak radial variation of the present mass function in the context of models with static , spherical galactic potentials ( see also vesperini 2000 , 2001 ) . as noted above",
    ", this is not the only , or even the most natural solution of this problem .",
    "our model provides a direct counterexample to these claims : an initial mass function with a power - law shape ( for @xmath89 ) evolves into the present mass function with a peak at @xmath90 and with the observed dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
