    "nevertheless , the transfer rate stays relatively constant as we go to the limit of free - exciton transfer rates .",
    "the derivation of an analytical expression for the matrix element and the exciton transfer rate in the case of a free exciton in infinitely long donor and acceptor tubes is shown in appendix [ sec : derivation_of_free_exciton_transfer_rate ] .",
    "we observe a different behavior when the donor and acceptor tubes are parallel .",
    "this case is particularly important because in many samples the cnts stick together and form cnt bundles . unlike the case of nonparallel cnts",
    ", we do not observe a drop in the exciton transfer rate with increasing size of quantum wells , as the average distance between the donor and acceptor states is almost independent of this size .",
    "we can predict this behavior based on the analytical expressions derived in appendix [ sec : derivation_of_free_exciton_transfer_rate ] .",
    "furthermore , based on the chirality of the donor and acceptor cnts , the exciton transfer rates follow different trends as the size of quantum wells increases . for small confinement lengths , the exciton center - of - mass momenta in initial and final states",
    "are not important factors in determining the strength of coulomb coupling ; therefore , there are many states in the acceptor tube that can resonate with the donor - tube excitonic states . however , as the confinement length increases , the contribution from the excitonic states that do not conserve momentum drops . in the limit of free - exciton transfer , only the states that conserve both the center - of - mass momentum and energy can transfer between the cnts .",
    "therefore , when the excitonic energy dispersions in the donor and acceptor tubes are dissimilar ( e.g. , due to different chiralities ) , a limited number of states contribute to the exciton transfer process .",
    "this results in a decrease of the exciton transfer rate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the donor and acceptor cnts have similar dispersion curves , there are many excitonic states that conserve both momentum and energy in donor and acceptor cnts , which increases the exciton transfer rate by about two orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer_rate_versus_cnt_length ] ) .",
    "these findings are in excellent agreements with measurements .",
    "have measured et rates between @xmath12 states within bundles of cnts that exceed @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "they also reported limited et rate between @xmath13 states which is due to the same momentum matching considerations that we have discussed here .",
    "recently , mehlenbacher _ et al . _",
    "studied et in samples where cnts are wrapped in polymers and in samples with no residual surfactant.@xcite .",
    "they found that , in the samples with no polymer wrapping , the et rate between parallel cnts is extremely fast , with @xmath141 time scales .",
    "two - dimensional anisotropy measurements showed much slower et rates between nonparallel cnts in these samples . on the other hand , mehlenbacher _ et al .",
    "_ found picosecond time scales for et rates in samples that cnts are wrapped in polymers . in these samples , et shows no preference between parallel and nonparallel relative orientation of donor and acceptor cnts .",
    "our calculations agree very well with these experimental findings : in pristine samples ( thus no exciton confinement ) , we expect high transfer rates between same - chirality parallel tubes ( @xmath142 ) and much lower rates when the tubes are misoriented . in samples with polymer residue , excitons exhibit confinement , which drastically reduces the rate of transfer between parallel tubes and results in isotropic et rates of around @xmath18 .          in this section",
    ", we study another effect of the cnt surrounding environment on the exciton transfer process . like most quasi - one - dimensional nanostructures ,",
    "the electronic and optical properties of cnts are influenced by their surrounding media .",
    "one of these environmental effects is the screening of electrostatic electron - electron and electron - hole interactions inside a cnt . as we discussed before , the relative dielectric permittivity @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : screened_coulomb_interaction ] ) accounts for the screening due to the surrounding medium and the core electrons in cnts . as @xmath61 increases , the self - energy due to repulsive electron - electron interaction and the binding energy due to the attractive electron - hole interaction decreases @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition_energy_vs_dielectric_constant]a , the net effect is a decrease in exciton energy with increasing permittivity . in the limit of infinite permittivity , we retrieve the noninteracting electron results .",
    "figure [ fig : transition_energy_vs_dielectric_constant ] show the energy dispersions for bright excitonic states assuming various values of @xmath61 .",
    "as expected , the binding energy and the number of tightly bound excitonic states decrease with increasing permittivity .",
    "screening of the coulomb interactions via the surrounding medium affects the et rates in two ways : by changing the exciton wave function and dispersion energy ( intratube screening effect ) and by changing the electron - electron interaction between the donor and acceptor cnts ( intertube screening effect ) .",
    "the first effect stems from the change in the permittivity of the environment in the small area around the donor / acceptor cnt ( we denote this permittivity by @xmath61 ) , whereas the second effect happens through changes in the average permittivity of the environment over long distances in the sample ( we capture this effect through @xmath103 ) .",
    "while @xmath103 and @xmath61 are generally not the same , for simplicity here we assume that they are .",
    "figure [ fig : transfer_rate_versus_dielectric_function]a shows the exciton transfer rate between bright excitonic states as a function of the environment relative permittivity when only the first effect is taken into account .",
    "the drop in the et rate with increasing relative permittivity can be explained by looking at the photon absorption and emission rates . for higher permittivities ,",
    "the excitonic states are more like free - electron and free - hole states than like bound excitons , and thus have lower photon absorption and emission rates @xcite .",
    "consequently , the rate of et , which is simultaneous photon emission and photon absorption by the two tubes , decreases .",
    "figure [ fig : transfer_rate_versus_dielectric_function]b shows the exciton transfer rate between bright excitonic states as a function of coulomb screening when accounting for both effects of screening . in this case ,",
    "the drop in the et rate with increasing permittivity is much more significant than in the previous case .",
    "this major drop is a result of a smaller perturbing hamiltonian , which has a dependence of @xmath144 .          as we discussed earlier , the excitonic states in cnts are classified as bright and dark states .",
    "the former exciton type is created via optical stimulation of ground - state electrons and the latter is usually populated through some second - order processes , such as raman scattering or the scattering of bright excitons into dark excitons by phonons and impurities . so far , we have studied the intrinsic exciton transfer rate from either bright or dark excitonic states . however , if the exciton scattering between bright and dark states is fast enough ( compared to the exciton transfer process ) , the excitons are thermalized among both bright and dark states and we have to consider both in the transfer process .",
    "figure [ fig : transfer_rate_versus_temperature_confined_exciton ] shows the exciton transfer rate as a function of temperature for the full exciton thermalization among bright and dark excitonic states ( fig . [ fig : transfer_rate_versus_temperature_confined_exciton]a ) and among bright states only ( fig . [ fig : transfer_rate_versus_temperature_confined_exciton]b ) . in the presence of exciton thermalization process between bright and dark excitonic states , we observe a twentyfold decrease in the exciton transfer rate .",
    "this is due to the presence of low - lying triplet states and the symmetric singlet states that do not transfer through the direct coulomb interaction .",
    "as the temperature decreases to @xmath145 , the excitons only populate these low - lying states and the transfer rate goes to zero.in addition , we note that the intrisic transfer rate between bright excitonic decreases when temperature drops .",
    "this trend is contrary to the behavior of radiative exciton decay rate predicted by perebeinos _",
    "in summary , we calculated the exciton transfer rates between semiconducting cnts of different chiralities and relative orientations .",
    "the exciton transfer rate is weakly dependent on the orientation of the tubes .",
    "this finding is in contradiction with previous theoretical studies , but in good agreement with experiments .",
    "the exciton transfer rate between bright excitonic states is about @xmath146 .",
    "the transfer rates between bright and dark states are at least two orders of magnitude smaller that the transfer rates between bright excitonic states",
    ". we also looked at the exciton transfer from @xmath13 to @xmath12 transition energies .",
    "we found that this type of exciton transfer process is as fast as transfer from @xmath12 to @xmath12 and from @xmath13 to @xmath13 states .",
    "this process is facilitated by coupling of tightly bound excitonic states in @xmath13 to the continuum level states ( equivalent of free - electron / free - hole states ) in @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we studied the environmental effects on the exciton transfer rates .",
    "we calculated the exciton transfer rate for excitons confined to quantum wells with various sizes .",
    "when the quantum - well size increases , we observed a decrease in the transfer rate between nonparallel tubes .",
    "this is due to the increase in the average distance between donor and acceptor systems . by introducing a more relevant quantity ( i.e. , transfer rate per donor tube length )",
    ", we showed that the exciton transfer rate is almost independent of the exciton confinement length .",
    "however , exciton transfer between parallel tubes follows a different trend : transfer between same - chirality donor and acceptor tubes is extremely sensitive to confinement and free excitons have the highest transfer rate ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the transfer rates between different - chirality tubes are not as sensitive to confinement and only slightly increase with decreasing confinement length .",
    "these findings are a result of momentum conservation rules .",
    "moreover , we looked at the effect of coulomb screening due to the surrounding media .",
    "the exciton transfer rate decreases with increasing screening .",
    "we also showed that the exciton transfer rate increases with increasing temperature . this behavior is the opposite of what one would expect based on the emission and absorption spectra of donor and acceptor systems .",
    "also , we showed that the exciton transfer rate drops by about one order of magnitude if excitons are thermalized between bright and dark excitonic states via extrinsic scattering sources ( e.g. , impurities and phonons ) .",
    "we conclude that the wide range of et - rate measurements , spanning two orders of magnitude , stems from variations in sample preparation and thus the degree of environmental disorder and homogeneity , as the et rates in pristine samples and in the samples in which environmental disorder results in exciton confinement differ by two orders of magnitude .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the transfer rate of free excitons between two very long cnts of radii @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we assume that the cnts are far enough that , from the point of view of each cnt , the other one looks like a continuous medium , so we can convert the last sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geometric_part_of_matrix_element ] ) to an integral : @xmath148 assuming that the cnts are shifted by a center - to - center distance @xmath149 along the @xmath150-axis and are misoriented by angle @xmath133 in the @xmath151 plane , the position vectors are @xmath152            using this relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exciton_transfer_rate ] ) , we can calculate the exciton transfer rate for free excitons .",
    "however , the transfer rate between two cnts goes to zero due to infinitely long donor cnt .",
    "however , we can consider the transition rate from a donor cnt to an array of cnts that are misoriented by angle @xmath133 .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to having a network of cnts .",
    "the number of acceptor cnts that the exciton can be transferred to from the initial donor cnt with length @xmath157 is @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the center - to - center distance in the array of acceptor cnts .",
    "therefore , the total transfer rate is      this equation turns out to be divergent at @xmath161 .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the transfer rate between completely parallel cnts is length - independent and we expect the transfer rate from the initial cnt to an infinite number of final cnts placed at a certain distance to become infinite .",
    "@xcite                      the primed quantities in the last relation show the excitonic states in the acceptor cnt that conserve the continuous component of the center - of - mass wave vector , i.e. , @xmath169 .",
    "the double - primed quantities represent the excitonic states on the donor cnt that conserve both the energy and the continuous part of the center - of - mass momentum in the transfer process , i.e. , @xmath170 .",
    "we should note that the final transfer rate is independent of the cnt length as the partition function , @xmath122 , is linearly dependent on the length of the donor cnt @xmath171    which cancels the parameter @xmath172 in the eq .",

    "<S> we compute the exciton transfer ( et ) rate between semiconducting single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the main reasons for the wide range of measured et rates reported in the literature are 1 ) exciton confinement in local quantum wells stemming from disorder in the environment and 2 ) exciton thermalization between dark and bright states due to intratube scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the swnt excitonic states are calculated by solving the bethe - salpeter equation using tight - binding basis functions . the et rates due to intertube coulomb interaction are computed via fermi s golden rule . in pristine samples , the et rate between parallel ( bundled ) swnts of similar chirality is very high ( @xmath0 ) while the et rate for dissimilar or nonparallel tubes is considerably lower ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> exciton confinement reduces the et rate between same - chirality parallel swnts by two orders of magnitude , but has little effect otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the et rate in most measurements will be on the order of @xmath2 , regardless of the tube relative orientation or chirality . </S>",
    "<S> exciton thermalization between bright and dark states further reduces the et rate to about @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the et rate also increases with increasing temperature and decreases with increasing dielectric constant of the surrounding medium . </S>"
