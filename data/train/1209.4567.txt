    "spin crossover in condensed matter physics is a transformation of a system with one spin @xmath0 at each lattice site into another state with spin @xmath1 induced by some external parameter like strong magnetic field , high pressure etc .",
    "it accompanies by the energy level @xmath2 and @xmath3 crossing , where @xmath4 is the local energy of the magnetic ion with spin @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "recently spin crossovers in magnetic oxides have been found under high pressure in @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite . below the curie temperature of magnetic order spin crossover",
    "is accompanied by the sharp change of the magnetization , nevertheless it may be observed in the paramagnetic state like in @xmath11 @xcite as the sharp change of the xes satellite / main peak intensity ratio with pressure increase .",
    "energy levels crossing results in the lost of analyticity in the energy spectrum at the critical point ( in the thermodynamic limit ) @xcite . near",
    "the critical point adiabaticity breaks down and non - equilibrium phenomena associated with the drastically grown quantum fluctuations can drive the system away from the ground state .",
    "the final result depends on how fast the transition occurs .",
    "if the quench process is sufficiently fast , large numbers of topological defects are created and the final state , being characterized by mixture of high and low spin phases , can be essentially different from that been obtained as result of slow evolution .",
    "qualitatively , quench dynamics can be described by the kibble - zurek theory of nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider quench dynamics in spin crossover induced by time - dependent pressure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a general model of spin crossover under high pressure is introduced . in sec .",
    "iii , we study quench dynamics .",
    "we consider two cases : a ) pressure is a linear function of time ; b ) pressure is defined by a pulse of a given shape .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a discussion of our results .",
    "the multielectron ion in a crystal field has the energies of terms for @xmath12 configurations determined numerically by the tanabe - sugano diagrams @xcite as a solution of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "simple analytical calculations of the low energy terms with different spin value that is sufficient to study spin crossover has been done recently @xcite .",
    "the crystal field parameter increase linearly with pressure @xmath13 .",
    "thus the multielectron energies for spin @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are also linear functions of @xmath13 . to distinguish two different spin states in the lattice we introduce the ising pseudospin states @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 runs over all sites in the lattice .",
    "thus we neglect the spin degeneracy of the @xmath19 terms but capture the possibility of energy level crossing that is the essential part of the spin crossover .",
    "then , in the basis @xmath20 , @xmath15 , the hamiltonian of the system can be written as follows @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the identity and pauli matrices , respectively ; the hamiltonian of interaction between the spins being @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath26 includes the isotropic heisenberg term with the exchange interaction @xmath27 between nearest spins and the anisotropic term @xmath28 .",
    "the interatomic interaction @xmath27 is negligibly small in comparison with the interatomic hund s coupling ( ratio @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus its contribution to the localized spin energy @xmath2 and @xmath3 due to the effective molecular field can be neglected .",
    "nevertheless the exchange interaction plays very important role : it results in the long range order and synchronize each spin in the same quantum state providing a cooperative behavior of the spin system .",
    "if it were the ferromagnetic interaction , each spin at t=0 would have the maximal projection @xmath30 with integer magnetic moment @xmath31 .    in all examples given above",
    "there is the antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the ground state of the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet has non integer local magnetic moment due to the quantum spin fluctuations .",
    "it is known that for large spin @xmath30 effect of quantum fluctuations is less important then for small spin , and for @xmath7 spin is @xmath32 .",
    "moreover the magnetic anisotropy additionally suppresses quantum fluctuations .",
    "for example , in @xmath7 the anisotropy field is @xmath33 @xcite and the measured value of the effective moment @xmath34 is very close to the calculated for @xmath35 value @xmath36 .",
    "thus we conclude that due to anisotropy the magnetic moment at @xmath37 has integer value ( of course it is a property of the magnetic insulator that does not hold for itinerant magnets ) , and due to exchange interaction all spins are in the same quantum state .",
    "so spin crossover at @xmath37 is the transition of the whole crystal from one magnetically ordered state to another .",
    "nevertheless the criterium of the transition can be found from consideration of the single ion energies crossover due to space uniform cooperative magnetic order .",
    "anisotropic relativistic interactions , for example a spin - orbital interaction , are also important because can mix different spin states inside single ion .",
    "we consider spin crossover far from the thermodynamic phase transition in the paramagnetic phase , it allows us to simplify this interaction and substitute the effect of exchange with the effective mean field . this mean field is spatially uniform for the ferromagnetic insulator or two - sublattice for the antiferromagnet one .",
    "examples given above @xcite correspond to the anti- or ferrimagnetics . in any case this mean field just renormalizes the interionic multielectron energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and is irrelevant to the crossover phenomenon .",
    "another interaction that is smaller then the exchange one is given by relativistic anisotropy contribution to the @xmath26 .",
    "for example a spin - orbital interaction can mix different spin states inside single ion , and it occurs to be important in our problem .    in what follows we will consider the simplified spatially uniform model @xcite .",
    "motivation for this simplification is as follows . despite that spin crossover",
    "is related to many body system , the essential features of its dynamics can be described by effective , landau - zener type , hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 the energy spectrum is given by @xmath40 .",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are pressure dependent .",
    "further we assume that the spin excitation gap is given by @xmath43 the crossover takes place at the point @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) mixes the different spin states , and it plays the role of quantum fluctuations in our ising pseudospin basis . the dimensionless spin gap , @xmath48 , plays a role of relative temperature @xmath49 near the critical point @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we consider time dependent schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( [ eqh2a ] ) assuming for simplicity that the pressure is the linear function of time , @xmath51 . inserting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq1a ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 depends on @xmath54 and can be written as @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 are eigenstates of the operator @xmath25 , so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 . expressing a generic state vector as @xmath60 and @xmath61 satisfy the schrdinger equation with the time - dependent hamiltonian in the landau - zener ( lz ) form ( in units @xmath62 ) @xmath63 where @xmath64",
    ".    in terms of dimensionless scaled time @xmath65 with @xmath66 , the landau - zener model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "writing @xmath69 , one can recast the schrdinger equation ( [ lz ] ) as @xmath70 here the time @xmath71 runs from the initial time @xmath72 , corresponding to the initial pressure @xmath73 , to final @xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath75 at the end of quench ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "further we assume that @xmath77 , then time @xmath71 can be extended to @xmath78 , and the problem becomes fully equivalent to the lz problem .    the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath79 , and its instantaneous eigenvectors can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the energy gap between the ground and excited states equals @xmath82 .    from eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) it follows that while the ground state behaves at @xmath83 as @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the excited state behaves as follows : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the state @xmath88 corresponds to the high spin ( hs ) of the system and @xmath89 corresponds to the low spin ( ls ) .",
    "thus , if the system initially was in the hs state , at the end of the evolution its ground state corresponds to the ls .",
    "tunnelling between the positive and negative energy eigenstates , leading to the mixture of hs and ls , happens in the neighbourhood of the critical point @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) when @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we assume further that the evolution of the system starts at the moment of time @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) from the ground state @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath47 , we have @xmath96 .",
    "this yields the following initial conditions : @xmath97 and @xmath98 . at the end of evolution",
    "we obtain , @xmath99 , while @xmath100 .    in figs .",

    "the motion begins at the south pole of the two - dimensional sphere @xmath102 and for @xmath103 ends at the north pole .",
    "however for the choice of the parameter @xmath104 , numerical simulation shows that the bloch vector never reaches the north pole , which corresponds to the ls state .",
    "this implies that at the end of evolution the quantum system does not remains in the ground state and its final state is the mixture of the lh and ls states .    in fig .",
    "[ p2a ] the probability @xmath105 of transition @xmath57 @xmath106 @xmath107 is depicted for various values of @xmath108 .",

    "its asymptotic behaviour is described by the lz formula ( [ p ] ) .",
    "the exact solution of the eq.([eq1 ] ) is given in terms of the parabolic cylinder functions@xcite , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",

    "the asymptotic of the transition probability is @xmath118 where @xmath119      in the adiabatic approximation the probability of the system to remain in the ground state may be described by @xmath120 the condition for adiabatic evolution , required by the adiabatic theorem , is @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the probability of remaining in the ground state at the end of evolution ( @xmath122 ) is given by @xmath123 .",

    "the ai - approximation assumes that the whole evolution can be divided in three parts and up to the phase factor the wave @xmath127 function approximately can be described as @xmath128 :   & & |u(\\tau ) \\rangle\\approx |u_{-}(\\tau ) \\rangle   \\\\",
