    "one could hardly overstate the major role played by symmetries in physics .",
    "symmetry considerations can very often drastically simplify the process of solving a given physics problem . at a more fundamental level",
    ", symmetries are deeply connected to the existence of conserved quantities ( _ via _ noether s theorem ) , and they considerably restrain the span of admissible field theories in modern theoretical physics . within einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) , which describes gravitation as a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime , the infinitesimal generators of isometries are called killing vector fields .",
    "they are widely used in current research in gravitation theory , and are an essential part of one s education in relativistic gravity @xcite .",
    "the existence of gravitational radiation is one of the most important predictions of gr .",
    "observing gravitational waves would have a tremendous impact on physics , astrophysics , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "a worldwide effort is currently underway to achieve the first direct detection , using kilometer - scale ground - based interferometers such as ligo and virgo , as well as future space - based antennas , such as the planned mission lisa .",
    "binary systems composed of compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes ) are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves .",
    "however , the detection and analysis of these exceedingly weak signals require very accurate theoretical predictions , for use as template waveforms to be compared to the output of the detectors @xcite .",
    "hence , modeling the orbital dynamics and gravitational - wave emission of compact binary systems is a timely problem in relativistic astrophysics .    except for the occurrence of a gradual inspiral driven by gravitational radiation - reaction , the orbital motion of stellar - mass compact - object binaries can be considered to be circular , to a very high degree of approximation .",
    "as long as the typical radiation - reaction timescale is much larger than the orbital period , _",
    "i.e. _ during most of the inspiral phase , the true orbital motion can be approximated by an adiabatic sequence of circular orbits .",
    "mathematically , the approximation of an exactly closed circular orbit translates into the existence of a _ helical killing vector _ ( hkv ) field @xmath0 , along the orbits of which the spacetime geometry is invariant . in the full theory of gr ,",
    "an exact helical symmetry requires incoming radiation to balance the outgoing radiation produced by the orbital motion @xcite .",
    "such unphysical incoming radiation can , however , be avoided by using various approximations to gr , such as the conformal flatness condition @xcite , the post - newtonian approximation in the conservative sector @xcite , or the extreme mass - ratio approximation at linear order @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider two non - spinning compact objects moving on exactly circular orbits .",
    "these will be modeled as point masses @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) , a prescription commonly adopted in the field of gravitational - wave source modeling ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite )",
    ". we will prove that the gradient @xmath3 of the norm @xmath4 of the helical killing vector @xmath0 must vanish along the worldlines of the particles : @xmath5 we then show how this simple , geometric result can be used to derive the main relation encoding the newtonian orbital dynamics of the binary system , namely kepler s third law ( restricted to circular orbits ) , and its generalization in post - newtonian theory .",
    "this unusual derivation can be used to illustrate numerous concepts of prime importance in a gr course , including those of killing vector , covariance , coordinate dependence , and gravitational redshift .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : killing ] we summarize some well - known , yet useful properties of killing vectors .",
    "we then discuss , in section [ sec : helical ] , the physics of binary systems of point masses moving along circular orbits , introducing the notion of redshift observable in section [ subsec : redshift ] , and proving the relation in section [ subsec : proof ] .",
    "the derivation of kepler s third law , and its generalization in post - newtonian theory , are discussed in sections [ subsec : keplernewt ] and [ subsec : kepler1pn ] , respectively . finally , section [ sec : k2_za ]",
    "is devoted to some further comments of physical relevance on the norm of the hkv and its link to the redshift observable .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , we start by summarizing a few elementary properties of killing vector fields , which will be used extensively throughout this paper .",
    "the main property of a killing field @xmath6 is that it satisfies killing s equation @xmath7 where @xmath3 is the covariant derivative compatible with the spacetime metric @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the lie derivative along @xmath6 .",
    "equation expresses the invariance of the spacetime geometry along the integral curves of the killing vector .",
    "furthermore , killing vectors provide well - defined conserved quantities .",
    "let @xmath10 be the four - velocity of a test particle , tangent to its worldline , and normalized such that @xmath11 .",
    "then the scalar product @xmath12 is a constant of the motion along the timelike geodesic followed by the test mass : @xmath13 this follows from the geodesic equations of motion , @xmath14 , and the antisymmetry of @xmath15 .",
    "two familiar examples of such conserved quantities in curved spacetime are the energy per unit mass @xmath16 and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath17 of a test particle in orbit around a rotating black hole , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are killing vectors associated with the stationarity and axisymmetry of the kerr metric .",
    "( @xmath20 ) on a circular orbit with constant azimuthal frequency @xmath21 .",
    "the helical killing vector @xmath22 is aligned with the four - velocities @xmath23 tangent to the worldlines @xmath24 of the particles .",
    "the redshift observables are given by the products @xmath25 . ]",
    "we now consider a binary system of non - spinning compact objects moving on a circular orbit . the neutron stars or black holes will be modeled as point particles with constant masses @xmath1 ( with @xmath20 ) , and four - velocities @xmath23 normalized to @xmath26 .",
    "note that the point masses @xmath1 are not test particles ; their stress - energy tensor curves the geometry through einstein s field equations .",
    "their motion obeys the standard geodesic equations , @xmath27 , albeit in a _",
    "metric @xmath28 such that the divergent self - fields of the point particles have been carefully subtracted @xcite .",
    "the spacetime metric of that binary system is neither stationary , nor axisymmetric ; however it is invariant along the integral curves of a helical killing vector @xmath0 . far away from the binary",
    ", this field has the asymptotic behavior @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are part of the coordinate basis of an inertial frame of reference .",
    "the constant @xmath21 is interpreted as the circular - orbit frequency of the binary system .",
    "heuristically , @xmath0 can be seen as the generator of time translations in a co - rotating frame . in particular ,",
    "if you imagine yourself `` sitting '' on one of the particles , orbiting around the companion star , then you would observe no change in the local geometry .",
    "in other words , the metric is invariant along the worldlines of the particles : @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that the four - velocities of the particles must be aligned with the hkv evaluated at their respective coordinate locations ( see figure [ fig : helical ] for an illustration ) : @xmath33 as a coefficient of proportionality between two vectors , @xmath34 , or equivalently @xmath35 , must be a scalar .",
    "it can be assigned several physical interpretations , which , in a gr course , would provide the opportunity to discuss the key notion of coordinate invariance .      first , contracting the relation with the four - velocity @xmath36 , and remembering , we notice that @xmath37 is a constant of the motion associated with the helical symmetry : @xmath38 furthermore , it can easily be shown that @xmath37 measures the redshift of light rays emitted from particle @xmath39 , and received far away from the binary , along the helical symmetry axis perpendicular to the orbital plane @xcite : let @xmath40 be a four - vector tangent to the worldline of such a light ray , _ e.g. _ the four - momentum of the associated `` photon ''",
    ". then the ratio of the photon energy at reception and emission is given by @xmath41 we made use of the equality @xmath42 between the four - velocity of the observer and the hkv ( since @xmath43 along the helical symmetry axis ) , of the relationship at the location of the emitter , and of the conservation of @xmath44 along the null geodesic followed by the photon .",
    "( the proof of that last point is identical to that given in , with the substitutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 . )",
    "see figure [ fig : redshift ] for an illustration of this gedankenexperiment .",
    "following detweiler @xcite , we shall thus refer to @xmath37 as the `` redshift observable '' of particle @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath47 adapted to the helical symmetry , _ i.e. _ such that the expression @xmath22 holds everywhere , that respects the helical symmetry must satisfy @xmath48 , and thus depends on the coordinate time @xmath49 and the azimuthal angle @xmath50 only in the combination @xmath51 . ] and not merely far away from the binary , eq .",
    "implies @xmath52 hence the redshift observable coincides with the inverse time component of the four - velocity of the particle , or equivalently with the ratio of the proper times elapsed along the worldlines of the particle and of the distant inertial observer ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure [ fig : redshift ] ) .",
    "this last interpretation is in agreement with the usual notion of redshift ( gravitational redshift and/or doppler effect ) .",
    "we now have at our disposal all of the concepts and results necessary to prove , namely that the spacetime gradient of the norm @xmath53 of the killing field must vanish at the location of each particle .",
    "the derivation goes as follows : @xmath54 we successively made use of the relationship between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , of killing s equation , of the geodesic equations of motion , and of the fact that @xmath37 is a constant of the motion .",
    "( the covariant derivative @xmath57 being evaluated along the four - velocity @xmath58 , we can replace @xmath59 by its value along the worldline of particle @xmath39 , namely @xmath60 . )",
    "although pretty straightforward , that proof would provide a good exercise for students .",
    "the formula is simple and elegant ; it is covariant , and only makes reference to well - defined geometrical concepts in gr .",
    "it implies , in particular , that @xmath61 has extrema at the coordinate locations of the point particles ( see figure [ fig : k ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we shall now show that encodes a well - known result of classical mechanics , namely kepler s third law ( for circular orbits ) , and its generalization in post - newtonian theory .     with four - momentum @xmath40",
    "is emitted from the particle @xmath62 with four - velocity @xmath63 , and received far away from the binary system , by a distant inertial observer with four - velocity @xmath64 , along the helical symmetry axis @xmath65 perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "detweiler s observable @xmath66 measures the redshift @xmath67 of the photon , or equivalently the ratio @xmath68 . ]",
    "we consider first the newtonian approximation of the full theory of general relativity , _ i.e. _ the leading - order results in the formal limit @xmath69 . in that weak - field , small velocity approximation ,",
    "the spacetime metric expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath47 takes the form @xmath70 where the newtonian gravitational potential reads @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the coordinate trajectory of the mass @xmath1 . in our adapted coordinates such that @xmath22 , the norm of the killing field reads @xmath73 . with the explicit expression of the metric",
    ", this gives @xmath74 in order to apply the result , we need first to compute the partial derivatives of @xmath4 . using the cartesian",
    "coordinates @xmath75 associated with the cylindrical coordinates @xmath76 in the usual way , namely @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the unit vector in the orbital plane @xmath82 . focusing first on the spatial components , the relationship implies @xmath83 we recognize newton s second law expressing the equality of the centripetal acceleration of body @xmath39 and of the newtonian gravitational force exerted on the body @xmath39 by the body @xmath84 . computing the forces explicitely ,",
    "we find @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the coordinate separation between the two point particles .",
    "we may then add up equations , or remember that in the center - of - mass frame @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the total mass of the binary .",
    "both solutions yield kepler s third law @xmath90 which is recovered here in the particular case of circular motion .",
    "( our derivation can not be extended to generic eccentric orbits , for which the helical symmetry is lost . ) on the other hand , the time component of is identically satisfied , as @xmath91 vanishes for circular orbits , @xmath92 being the coordinate velocity of the particle @xmath84 , and @xmath93 the unit vector pointing from @xmath94 to @xmath62 .    in the newtonian limit",
    ", the geometric condition can be related to a standard result of classical mechanics : it is well - known that in a frame rotating at the angular rate @xmath21 with respect to a mass - centered , inertial frame of reference , both point masses can be described as being at rest , sitting at local minima of the effective potential @xmath95 the repulsive centrifugal force deriving from the harmonic potential @xmath96 balancing exactly the attractive gravitational force deriving from the newtonian potential @xmath97 . now , comparing and , we note that @xmath98 ; hence the condition @xmath99 from which we derived kepler s third law is nothing but the result @xmath100 in disguise .",
    "see figure [ fig : k ] for an illustration .",
    "the scalar field @xmath4 can thus be thought of as a relativistic generalization of the effective potential @xmath101 , and the condition as a covariant generalization of the newtonian result @xmath100 .",
    "since is valid beyond the newtonian limit , the relation can be extended to include corrections coming from the full theory , by keeping known post - newtonian terms in the metric @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , at first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) order ,",

    "from the newtonian result , we have the asymptotic behavior @xmath122 in the limit @xmath123 , which indicates that the hkv is spacelike far away from the helical symmetry axis .",
    "close to the binary system , however , and along the worldlines of the particles in particular , the hkv is timelike ( @xmath124 ) [ remember ] . in between , there must exist a worldtube over which the hkv is null ( @xmath125 . this hypersurface is usually referred to as the `` light cylinder '' . in the flat spacetime limit @xmath126 ,",
