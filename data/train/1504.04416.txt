    "there is an increasing interest in the construction of a high energy electron - positron collider @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this new facility will be to carry out precision measurements of electroweak physics , including the higgs boson properties .",
    "an important byproduct of this program will be the study of high energy photon - photon collisions @xcite and the continuation , at energies one order of magnitude higher , of the measurements performed at cern - lep , almost fifteen years ago .",
    "photon - photon collisions are a very clean laboratory for the theory of strong interactions  quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  where we can test details of the qcd dynamics at high energies , such as the evolution both in virtuality ( @xmath6 ) and in energy ( @xmath7 ) ( for a review see , e.g. ref .",
    "it has motivated the development of a large number of phenomenological studies in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "in particular , several authors have discussed the possibility of use the scattering of two off - shell photons at high energy in @xmath8 colliders as a probe of the parton saturation effects in the qcd dynamics , which are predicted to be present in the high energy regime @xcite .",
    "although the experimental results on several inclusive and diffractive observables measured in @xmath9 scattering at hera and hadron - hadron collisions at rhic and lhc suggest that these effects are already observed in the energy regime probed by current colliders , these observations still need further confirmation .",
    "the state - of - art framework to treat qcd at high energies is the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism @xcite , which predicts the saturation of the growth of parton distributions , with the evolution with the energy being described by an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for the correlators of wilson lines  the balitsky - jimwlk hierarchy ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . in the mean field approximation , this set of equations",
    "can be approximated by the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , in general , the applications of the cgc formalism to scattering problems require an asymmetric frame , in which the projectile has a simple structure and the evolution occurs in the target wave function , as it is the case in deep inelastic scattering",
    ". therefore the extension of the bk equation to the calculation of the @xmath0 scattering cross section is not a trivial task . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed this generalization in order to use the solution of the bk equation as input of our calculations of the total @xmath10 cross sections and photon structure functions , which were compared with the lep data . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have improved the treatment of the dipole - dipole cross section , which is the main ingredient of the description of the @xmath0 interactions in the dipole picture . differently from previous phenomenological studies , which disregarded the impact parameter dependence ,",
    "we have proposed an educated guess for this dependence and demonstrated that the lep data can be described in this approach .",
    "the high energy behavior of the observables predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite is largely different from those obtained in previous studies .",
    "this conclusion motivates us to review the analysis of other observables which could be measured at the ilc .",
    "one promising observable is double vector meson production in @xmath0 collisions , which has attracted the attention of several theoretical groups in the last years , with the cross section being estimated in different theoretical frameworks @xcite , as , for instance , the solution of the bfkl equation and impact factors at leading and next - to - leading orders . in this paper",
    "we will estimate the total @xmath1 cross - sections for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 considering the improved treatment of the dipole - dipole cross section and the energy and virtuality dependencies of the total cross sections will be analyzed in detail .",
    "our analysis is strongly motivated by the fact that our knowledge about vector meson wave functions has improved considerably over the last years with the progress of phenomenological studies of vector meson production at hera . as a consequence",
    "the main ingredients of our calculations are constrained by lep and hera data and hence our predictions for the ilc energies have only one free parameter  the slope parameter @xmath11  which determines the @xmath12 - dependence of the cross sections .",
    "the magnitude of this parameter for different combinations of vector mesons is still an open issue that deserves more detailed studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism , discussing in more detail the vector meson wave functions and the dipole - dipole cross section , which are the main inputs of our calculations . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our predictions for the production of different combinations of vector mesons .",
    "in particular , the dependencies of the cross sections on the energy and photon virtualities are analyzed in detail .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present our summary .",
    "let us review the main formulas of vector meson production in the color dipole picture ( for more details see , e.g. ref .",
    "the relevant scattering process is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for both light and heavy vector mesons . at high energies ,",
    "this scattering can be seen as a succession in time of three factorizable subprocesses ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) : i ) the photons fluctuate into quark - antiquark pairs ( the dipoles ) , ii ) these color dipoles interact and , iii ) the pairs convert into the vector meson final states . using as kinematic variables the @xmath10 c.m.s .",

    "the imaginary part of the amplitude at zero momentum transfer @xmath22 reads as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the light - cone wave functions of the photon and vector meson , respectively .",
    "the quark and antiquark helicities are labelled by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and reference to the meson and photon helicities are implicitly understood .",
    "the variable @xmath30 defines the relative transverse separation of the pair ( dipole ) and @xmath31 @xmath32 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "similar definitions are valid for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the variable @xmath35 will be defined later .",

    "are obtained through two dimensional fourier transform of the momentum space light - cone wave functions @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this subject has been intensely discussed in several references ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in what follows we present , for completeness , some of the main formulas .",
    "the normalized light - cone wave functions for longitudinally ( @xmath41 ) and transversely ( @xmath42 ) polarized photons are given by @xmath43\\frac{k_{0}(\\varepsilon r)}{2\\pi}\\ , , \\label{wft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 .",

    "[ fig4 ] we present our predictions for the normalized cross sections .",
    "the different cross sections were all normalized to the unity at @xmath77 gev to better exhibit the different trends .",
    "for @xmath78 we observe a clear transition between the soft and hard regimes , with the growth with the energy being faster for heavier mesons in the final state .",
    "moreover , we find that model 2 predicts a smaller slope than model 1 . for @xmath79 gev@xmath80 , a similar behavior is observed , but in this case already for the @xmath81 production we see a steep rise of the cross section with the energy , which is directly associated to the presence of the hard scale @xmath6 .    in certain cases , where the slope parameters are phenomenologically known , it is possible to make definite predictions . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the cross sections calculated with models 1 and 2 as a function of the energy @xmath82 with the proper slope coefficients , taken from @xcite : @xmath83 gev@xmath84 , @xmath85 gev@xmath84 and @xmath86 gev@xmath84 .",
    "our predictions with model 1 are similar to those obtained in @xcite , with small differences mainly associated to the different forward dipole scattering amplitude and to the treatment of the vector meson wave functions .",
    "in contrast , with model 2 , we predict that at @xmath87 tev the cross sections are @xmath88 nb , @xmath89 nb and @xmath90 nb , which are a factor @xmath91 smaller than previous estimates in the literature obtained using the color dipole picture .",
    "although saturation effects of qcd dynamics are expected to take over at higher energies , this change of dynamics can manifest itself with different strength for different observables .",
    "for this reason , when working with the dipole approach , which is naturally prepared to incorporate nonlinear corrections , it is always interesting to quantify the importance of the saturation effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show our results for the energy dependence of the @xmath92 cross section , where we compare the full iim - s model predictions with those obtained considering the linear regime of this model ( first line in eq . ( [ cgcfit ] ) ) .",
    "we see that the high energy behavior of the cross section is strongly modified by saturation effects .",
    "this conclusion was already obtained in @xcite and we see that it remains valid even after updating the dipole cross sections and model for the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the scattering of two off - shell photons at high energy in @xmath8 colliders is an interesting process to look for parton saturation efffects . in these two - photon reactions ,",
    "the photon virtualities can be made large enough to ensure the applicability of perturbative methods or can be varied in order to test the transition between the soft and hard regimes of the qcd dynamics . in recent years , a series of studies have discussed in detail the treatment of the total cross section and the exclusive production of different final states in @xmath0 interactions considering very distinct theoretical approaches .",
    "one great motivation for these works is the possibility that in a near future @xmath0 interactions may be investigated at the international linear collider ( ilc ) . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a detailed analysis of the @xmath0 cross section at high energies using the color dipole picture and taking into account saturation effects , which are expected to be visible at high energies . in this paper we extended our approach to double vector meson production , improving the previous analysis in three important aspects : i ) the theoretical treatment of the dipole - dipole cross section ; ii ) the forward scattering amplitude , considering the solution of the running coupling bk equation ( which is the state - of - art of the cgc formalism ) ; and iii ) the treatment of the vector meson wave functions .",
    "considering that all parameters of our approach have been fixed by fitting hera and lep data , our predictions for double vector meson production at ilc are parameter free , except for the only unknown parameter : the slope parameter @xmath93 , which deserves a more detailed analysis .",
    "our main conclusion is that the improvement of the theoretical framework for double vector meson production in @xmath0 interactions resulted in a reduction of the previously estimated cross sections at ilc energies .",
    "however , our results indicate that the experimental analysis at ilc is feasible and may be useful to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies . as a final remark we would like to say that understanding vector meson production in @xmath0 collisions is very important not only for the phenomenology of future electron - positron colliders but also for exclusive double vector meson production in hadron - hadron collisions , which have been studied at the lhc and that could be further studied in future hadronic colliders",
