    "helium-4 plays a central role in big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the calculation of the primordial helium abundance is robust , being only weakly sensitive to the cosmic baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "however , the helium abundance is quite sensitive to , and provides a strong constraint on the physics of the early universe .",
    "the primordial abundance of helium ( with mass fraction ) is best determined via observations of  regions in the most metal - poor galaxies  dwarf irregulars and blue compact galaxies ( hereafter , bcgs ) . for these systems , the helium evolution is derived empirically : the data show that the helium abundance increases with metallicity indicators such as oxygen and nitrogen . following peimbert & torres - peimbert , , the primordial abundance of helium is inferred from an extrapolation of the observed trend to zero metallicity .",
    "as emphasized by fields & olive ; fields , kainulainen , olive , & thomas ; and olive , steigman , & skillman ( @xcite ; hereafter oss97 ) , the empirical extrapolation of primordial helium sidesteps any reliance on detailed results of chemical evolution models , especially since the extrapolation to zero metallicity from the data is small .",
    "indeed , until the measurements of d / h in quasar absorption systems can be confirmed to represent a uniform primordial value , the 4 abundance is crucial when used in conjunction with 7 as a test of big bang nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "( this remains true so long as @xmath4 ; at high , the insensitivity of  to @xmath3 makes 4 a very poor discriminator for primordial nucleosynthesis . )",
    "thus , given the importance of 4 as observed in bcgs , it is clearly of interest to compare the predictions of chemical evolution with the observations of these systems .",
    "a less than successful comparison of theory with observation could point to the subtleties in chemical evolution modeling of even these ( apparently ) simple systems .",
    "several groups have modeled the chemical evolution of bcgs ( matteucci & chiosi @xcite ; matteucci & tosi @xcite ; gilmore & wyse @xcite ; pilyugin @xcite ; clayton & tantelaki @xcite ; marconi , matteucci & tosi @xcite ; carigi , coln , peimbert , & sarimento @xcite ) .",
    "the high star formation activity in bcgs indicates that star formation must occur in stochastic bursts , unless the systems are very young ; all models included this behavior .",
    "in addition , these galaxies probably drive outflows of material , perhaps with efficiencies high enough to significantly alter the chemical and/or dynamical evolution . for example , the gas fraction ",
    "metallicity relations of bcgs may not be compatible with closed box models , suggesting the importance of gas outflow via supernova - driven outflows ( lequeux , rayo , serrano , peimbert , & torres - peimbert @xcite ; matteucci & chiosi @xcite ; carigi , coln , peimbert , & sarimento @xcite)though the difficulties of determining an accurate gas  to  baryon fraction lead to significant uncertainties in these arguments . in any case , x - ray observations of diffuse , hot gas clearly support the existence of outflows in some bcgs ( heckman et al .",
    "@xcite ; della ceca , griffiths , heckman , & mackenty @xcite ; della ceca , griffiths , & heckman @xcite ) , though skillman and skillman & bender present arguments against a dominant role of outflows in _ all _ dwarf galaxies .",
    "independent of the question of outflows , another key result from these studies showed that the usual instantaneous _ mixing _ approximation is inappropriate .",
    "self - enrichment of  regions in a burst phase ( kunth & sargent @xcite ; kunth , lequeux , sargent , & viallefond @xcite ; but see pettini & lipman @xcite ) can lead to significant scatter in abundance trends .",
    "most recently , it has been argued that the due to the intense bursts of star formation and energy release in the evolution of these systems , their stability requires of the presence of significant amounts of dark matter ( bradamante , matteucci , & dercole @xcite ) .",
    "this may have an impact on the effect of supernovae driven winds on the elements abundances . in a somewhat different approach , mac low & ferrara take the presence of dark matter as a starting point , and examine the requirements for bcg outflows as a function of supernova rate and galaxy mass .",
    "their models of the the dark matter potential , and the detailed gas dynamics of outflows , suggest that the loss of the entire ism``blowaway''is only possible for smaller galaxies ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , mac low & ferrara also find that the preferential escape of the energetic and metal - enriched supernova ejecta is much easier , occurring at significant levels for galaxies with baryonic masses up to @xmath6 .    while there has been great progress in laying out the basic features of bcg chemical evolution , some important issues remain unresolved , including some bearing on derivation of primordial helium .",
    "for example , there remains some question as to the theoretical justification for the linear fit of helium versus metals , particularly nitrogen ( e.g. , mathews , boyd , & fuller @xcite ; balbes , boyd , & mathews @xcite ) .",
    "closely related to this is the dependence of the inferred  on the metallicity tracer .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , oss97 ; olive , steigman , & walker @xcite ) have found that the primordial helium abundance derived from a linear fit to @xmath7n consistently differs by about @xmath8 from that derived via @xmath7o . while this difference is as yet too mild to be a problem , it does suggest need to re - examine the appropriateness of the linear fits in the context of detailed chemical evolution models .",
    "recent new observations such as the growing set of carbon observations are ripe for more theoretical attention .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the chemical evolution of bcgs , with particular attention to these issues related to primordial helium , and the uncertainties in the chemical evolution modeling . in particular , we note the interplay between galactic outflow prescriptions and nucleosynthesis uncertainties .",
    "different parameterizations for the nucleosynthesis of nitrogen and their role ( n ) versus ( o ) discrepancy are also considered .",
    "we note the model - dependence of @xmath9 and other slopes , and examine in detail a suggestion by fields that helium production processes due to low - mass supernovae or high - mass stellar winds may account for the large observed values of the slopes .",
    "we conclude that the empirical fitting procedures used to obtain  do find support from our models .",
    "however , we also note that models using the most recent and detailed nucleosynthesis yields do no reproduce the observed @xmath7n , o trends , even in the presence of outflows .",
    "possible solutions to this problem are discussed .",
    "the present observations of helium and metal tracer ( n and o ) abundances in bcgs are summarized in oss97 .",
    "their analysis included the data of pagel , skillman & kennicutt , skillman , skillman ( private communication ) , and izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter itl97 ) . though the itl97 set was shown to be consistent with the prior data on a point by point basis , a linear extrapolation of the itl97 set alone yields a significantly different slope in the @xmath7o / h plane , and a higher primordial 4  abundance .",
    "this suggests a systematic discrepancy , a problem further accentuated in the more recent data of izotov & thuan ( @xcite , hereafter , it ) , which we comment on below .",

    "while the quoted error may reflect the uncertainty they considered , it was argued by skillman that abundance measurements can not be made to an accuracy of better than 2% at this time . for 4",
    ", this corresponds to an uncertainty of about 0.005 for an individual point .",
    "therefore we have systematically imposed a lower limit on the uncertainty of any abundance measurement of 2% .",

    "this gives @xmath31o / h . however , as argued in oss97 there are inherent uncertainties in this method which are not reflected in the error budget .",
    "for this reason and because we can more easily compare their data with previous data , we use their results which are based on s ii densities .    in all of the data sets in table [ tab : y_fit ] , the helium slopes @xmath32 are several standard deviations away from zero  the increase of helium versus metal tracers is highly statistically significant as was argued in olive , steigman & walker .",
    "note also that the @xmath30 versus n and o fits have a @xmath33 per degree of freedom @xmath34 .",
    "this suggests that the scatter in @xmath30-no is entirely consistent with the ( statistical ) observational uncertainties .",
    "indeed , the small @xmath14 suggest that the quoted errors might be underestimated ( though it does not address the thorny issue of systematic errors )",
    ".    we will take the b98 data as our set of bcg abundances to model ; the key parameter in judging the he evolution we calculate will be the slopes of the linear regressions . for brevity",
    ", we will denote the `` helium slope '' @xmath35 , with a similar expression for n. for comparison with previous work , table [ tab : y_fit ] also quotes values for @xmath9 , with @xmath36 .",
    "however , in this paper we will emphasize @xmath0o and @xmath0n , which are closer to the data and avoid questions of how to infer @xmath17 from the observations .",
    "oss97 also examined the growth of nitrogen as a function of oxygen , as a diagnostic of a component of `` secondary '' nitrogen .",
    "such a component would arise if the stellar nitrogen yield is proportional to the initial abundance of a `` seed '' isotope such as @xmath37c .",
    "parameters for a quadratic fit , and a power law fit , appear in table [ tab : no_fit ] .",
    "both of these fits are consistent with a combination of primary and secondary nitrogen , ( and worsen significantly if one demands that n is purely primary or secondary ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath38 indicates that the scatter in the data is not consistent with the ( statistical ) observational errors alone . in other words ,",
    "the scatter must be due to either systematic errors , or an intrinsic dispersion in the data .",
    "we will examine this point further below (  [ sect : scatter ] ) .",
    "given the nonlinear dependence of nitrogen on oxygen , it follows that the helium can not increase linearly with both of these tracers .",
    "specifically , oxygen is almost certainly `` primary '' and so on general grounds one can expect @xmath7o to be at least roughly linear .",
    "however , since nitrogen has a nonlinear , secondary component ( versus o / h ) , one would expect that @xmath7n is not a linear trend .",
    "the departure from linearity ( as inferred from combining a linear @xmath7o and quadratic n  o ) is not large , and does not set in until the quadratic term in n  o is roughly comparable to the linear term .",
    "this transition is around @xmath39 , or at @xmath40 .",
    "note that these regions coincide nicely with the metallicity cuts that define data set b98 .",
    "still , in this metallicity range , @xmath30 versus n still displays some sensitivity to the secondary component of n. if the quadratic component of the n  o fit were truly negligible ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) , then one would expect the slopes in the heno planes to be related by @xmath42 ; in fact , this relation is off by @xmath1 , due to the effect of secondary n in depressing @xmath43 .",
    "recently , lu , sargent , & barlow have provided complementary observations relevant to the n@xmath29o trends in low metallicity ( down to [ si / h]@xmath44 ) systems .",
    "they used the n / si ratio in damped lyman-@xmath45 quasar absorption systems as a diagnostic for n / o at high redshift , under the well - motivated assumption that silicon is predominantly produced by type ii supernovae , and thus traces oxygen .",
    "the lu , sargent , & barlow data is best fit by a combination of primary and secondary nitrogen , consistent with the bcg observations .",
    "furthermore , the quasar absorber data suggests that n shows increased scatter at low o / h .",
    "these observations have considerable uncertainties due to , e.g. , possible effects of n or si depletion onto dust grains ; nevertheless lu et al",
    ".  argue that the basic trends are real , and are consistent with a `` time - delayed '' origin of nitrogen in low - mass stars , which we investigate in the next section .    finally ,",
    "van zee , salzer , & haynes have recently observed n , and o in low metallicity spiral galaxies .",
    "they find no evidence of a real difference between the n  o trends in dwarfs and spirals , except that the abundances in dwarfs extend to lower metallicities .",
    "they identify the transition point between the low - metallicity , primary behavior of n  o to the high - metallicity , secondary behavior ; they locate this point  the `` knee''at @xmath46 .",
    "this is consistent with our estimate above , that the onset of nonlinearity occurs around @xmath47 , or @xmath48 .",
    "chemical evolution models of bcgs have considered not only the origin of the mean abundance trends , but also sources of dispersion about the mean .",
    "several authors ( garnett @xcite ; pilyugin @xcite ; marconi , matteucci , & tosi @xcite ) have noted that the bursting star formation in the  regions leads to an _ intrinsic _ component of dispersion .",
    "this comes about essentially due to incomplete , non - instantaneous mixing of burst ejecta , coupled with different evolutionary timescales for he , n , and o. specifically , consider an initially well - mixed  region in a bcg , with an initial composition that falls on the mean heno evolution . upon a burst of star formation , high mass stars will explode first ( as supernovae ) , and the death of low mass stars will be delayed relative to this . in this way , the initial mass function of the burst is effectively scanned over time , from the high mass end to the low .",
    "self - enrichment of the bursting ( i.e. , ) region is a transient phenomenon ; it occurs in the time interval when the burst s high - mass stars have begun to die and inject their nucleosynthesis products , but before a significant portion of the low - mass stars have done so . because the high - mass stars only produce some elements , their enrichment drives the region s composition away from the mean ( well - mixed ) heno trends .",
    "the bursting region only relaxes to the average instantaneous mixing trend after the low mass stars finally return their ejecta . over a still longer timescale , the enriched region would remix its composition with the rest of ism .",
    "this remixing may or may not occur before the next burst begins .",
    "this scheme , therefore , predicts that intrinsic scatter inevitably occurs at some level .",
    "furthermore , the self - enrichment mechanism predicts _ correlations _ in the dispersion patterns .",
    "again , we are interested in a bcg with an ( initially ) well - mixed composition falling on the mean trends in heno ; and we suppose there is a burst of star formation which forms an  region .",
    "now consider the epoch of `` adolescence , '' when only the most massive stars ( @xmath49 myr ) have died .",
    "these stars make all of the burst s complement of new o , about half of the new he , and very little of the new n. placing this system on the space of heno abundances , we see that compared to the mean trend , this system would show a low n / h and a low @xmath30 for its o / h abundance .",
    "conversely , for its n / h , our adolescent system would have a high @xmath30 relative to the average .",
    "these correlations should exist , and will be observable in the data if the amplitude of the intrinsic scatter is larger than the observational errors .",
    "we now examine the data for evidence of these correlations . to do this",
    ", we will divide the 3-dimensional heno data space according to our 2-elements fits ( which suppress one element , e.g. , fitting n versus o ; see tables [ tab : y_fit ] and [ tab : no_fit ] ) .",
    "these fits describe 2-dimensional surfaces in the data space , and we will divide the data into points above and below the fit . then we will examine these points in the two planes suppressed in the fit .",
    "for example , using the oss97 quadratic fit to n@xmath29o ( table [ tab : no_fit ] ) , we cut the n@xmath29o plane into regions of `` high n '' and `` low n '' ( fig .  [",
    "fig : nocut]a ) . in figures [ fig : nocut]b and [ fig : nocut]c , we replot the high- and low - n points in the @xmath30o / h and @xmath30n / h planes .",
    "let us assume for the moment that the scatter in each of the three plots is real and due to self - enrichment . then",
    ", as argued in the preceding paragraph , the low n points represent regions that are self - enriched ; thus these points should have _ low _",
    "@xmath30 relative to their oxygen abundance and the mean @xmath7o trend .",
    "similarly , we expect the same points to have _ high _ @xmath30 relative to their nitrogen abundance and the mean @xmath7n trend .",
    "that is , there should be correlations between a bcgs location on the n@xmath29o scatter and its position on @xmath7no ; furthermore , the expected clusterings in @xmath7n and @xmath7o are on opposite sides of the respective means .",
    "however , these correlations do not appear in the data . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nocut]b , both the high and low n points fill the @xmath7no spreads more or less evenly .",
    "the fraction of low n points that are high in figure [ fig : nocut]b ( i.e. , above our @xmath7n fit ) is @xmath50 , compared to @xmath51 for high n points .",
    "effects of counting statistics , implicitly assuming perfect determination of the abundances  thus significantly underestimating the true error . ] in the @xmath7o plane ( figure [ fig : nocut]c ) , the the low n population has a fraction @xmath52 of points with high @xmath30 ; the high n population has @xmath53 . thus the high and low populations in n  o show no significant difference in the other two planes . in particular , there is no evidence that the low n points are biased high in @xmath7n and low in @xmath7o .",
    "we can also perform a similar test for self - enrichment correlations by splitting the data according to the location on the @xmath7o plane . as with the n  o split",
    ", we are unable to find convincing evidence for the correlations expected from self - enrichment.o and high @xmath7n populations , but this is simply due to the shallow slopes of each trend  which means that the he points are just `` reshuffled''and to the relative tightness of the n  o relation , which prevents significant reshuffling .",
    "this strong correlation is not , however , the one expected from self - enrichment . ]",
    "one can understand these results if the dispersion in @xmath7n and @xmath7o is largely observational , as indeed strongly suggested by the low @xmath34 for these data .",
    "the preceding discussion confirms this lack of real dispersion , even if one were to assign the observations smaller errors .",
    "this is not to say that intrinsic spread is absent , but rather that considerably more accurate data will be needed to detect it .",
    "however , the small @xmath14 does suggest that whatever scatter is present must be relatively small  certainly less than the observational errors .    on the other hand",
    ", the n  o fit has @xmath54 ; thus it is quite likely that the n  o data _ does _ contain scatter beyond the observational error . while some of this could be systematic",
    ", it is certainly possible that some is real .",
    "thus , models to explain the scatter must account for the n  o spread without introducing too much dispersion in @xmath30 versus n and o. also , as discussed below , pilyugin and marconi , matteucci , & tosi , predict that the n ",
    "o scatter amplitude is much larger than the @xmath7n , o scatter .",
    "indeed , bcgs could well undergo enriched outflows which preferentially remove massive star ejecta ( see below ) ; this effect would suppress the degree of self - enrichment in an adolescent  region .    in light of the real scatter in the bcg nitrogen versus oxygen trends",
    ", we now turn to the lu , sargent , & barkow observations of n / si ( @xmath55",
    "n / o ) in damped ly@xmath45 absorbers ( dla ) .",
    "the observations are at @xmath56 , which implies @xmath57 gyr for most reasonable cosmologies , which is an early epoch , but still late enough that stars with @xmath58 can already have died .",
    "low - mass stars can thus have produced the nitrogen in these systems .",
    "in fact , lu et al .",
    "find that the n / si scatter increases at low metallicity , and suggest that this is arises due to the longer timescales for n production in low - mass stars .    while n / si in dlas is related to the n@xmath29o behavior in bcgs , the two systems are likely very different .",
    "dlas are probably large galaxies similar to own , and significantly bigger than bcgs",
    ". a larger size of the dlas would suggest star formation proceeding in a more continuous manner , where stochastic bursting effects would be smaller or nonexistent consequently , for an individual dla , there would be less spread due to bursting self - enrichment as in bcgs . however , if there is a variance in the ensemble of dla star formation histories , one would predict a spread in n@xmath29o .",
    "that is , if different dlas at fixed @xmath59 have different star forming timescales or amplitudes , this would cause variations in not only o ( which measures the total integrated star formation ) , but also n / o ( which measures the fraction of star formation occurring over low - mass star lifetimes ) .",
    "we note two scenarios in which an _ increased _ scatter in n@xmath29o at low metallicities is a measure of the variance in dla star formation histories .",
    "( 1 ) the early star formation in dlas has significant variance in starting time and/or duration , but similar integrated amplitudes .",
    "thus , at late times and high metallicities , all galaxies have the full complement of n and thus the same n / o .",
    "( 2 ) star formation depends on the size ( e.g. , mass , surface or volume density as in a schmidt law ) of the dlas , and/or galactic winds . hence , coeval but different systems will have had dissimilar star formation histories and thus different n / o , with dispersion again decreasing as the total star formation slows at late times .",
    "the lesson we have learned in this section , therefore , is that there is ( very likely ) intrinsic scatter in the n  o data .",
    "in contrast , the small scatter in the helium abundances is entirely consistent with the observational errors .",
    "therefore , while self - enrichment may well occur in bcgs , and might be responsible for the n  o dispersion , the helium abundances can not ( yet ) confirm this scheme . in view of this",
    ", we will not attempt to model the observational scatter in this paper ; instead , we will limit ourselves to models describing the mean abundance trends . with this more modest goal",
    ", we concentrate on the uncertainties inherent in chemical evolution models of bcgs , and their implications for deriving primordial helium abundances .",
    "to construct models for bcg chemical evolution , we adopt the usual chemical evolution formalism , allowing for outflows of both bulk ism material as well as enriched supernova ejecta . for simplicity and in the absence of strong evidence otherwise , we will adopt an initial mass function ( hereafter , imf ) @xmath60 , which is time - independent .",

    "the central issue in building a model of bcgs is the choice of an appropriate star formation rate and outflow prescription .",
    "regarding the star formation rate , observations indicate that bcgs are undergoing bursts of star formation , and many of these systems have a history of stochastic bursts separated by periods of quiescence . in a simple closed box , instantaneous recycling chemical evolution model ,",
    "the details of the star formation history are irrelevant for the abundance patterns . however , the difference between bursting versus smooth star formation can be important in more realistic models where : ( 1 ) the assumption of instantaneous recycling is relaxed , and finite stellar lifetimes are included , and ( 2 ) the assumption of a closed box is relaxed , and outflows are adopted .",
    "consequently , we will examine the effect of bursting versus smooth star formation rates ; in fact , we will find that the effects of bursting are not as important as one might at first imagine .",
    "the collective effect of supernovae leads to gas bulk motions , as well as heating and evaporation , which we model the via outflows .",
    "the outflow thus has two components .",
    "( 1 ) we allow a bulk `` ism wind , '' with rate @xmath86 , and the composition of the ism : @xmath87 . for simplicity",
    ", we follow the hartwick model , in which the galactic wind is proportional to the supernova rate ( and hence star formation rate ) that drives it : [ eq : wind_ism ] _ ism = given that the outflow rates used here are relatively slow , this is consistent with the prescription of scully based on larson .",
    "as suggested by recent results of mac low & ferrara , the mass ejection efficiency is likely to be low in bcgs if they have a large complement of dark matter .",
    "note that the democracy of the ism wind leads to the absence of an explicit term in the abundance evolution .",
    "however , these outflows can still be influential as they reduce @xmath65 faster than in a closed box model .",
    "( 2 ) the other outflow component is an `` enriched wind , '' with rate @xmath88 .",
    "this process posits the partial removal of supernova ejecta and hence heavy elements : @xmath89 , where in the last expression the ejection integrals include only supernova ejecta .",
    "we further assume that the ejection rate is proportional to the total supernova mass ejection rate , with efficiency @xmath90 .",
    "thus we write @xmath91 . in sum , therefore , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "this gives , in eq .",
    "[ eq : wind_sn ] ( ^i - x^i ) = ( e^i_sn - x^i e_sn ) where the ism term drops out because @xmath94 . as this wind",
    "is composed of only supernova products , it reduces the effective supernova yield , and clearly will have a significant impact on elements wholly or partially made in supernovae .",
    "as the preceding section made clear , the uncertainties in the parameter and input physics choices leads to a large number of possible models .",
    "we have investigated the parameter space extensively .",
    "however , rather than presenting all models , we will instead summarize the basic trends , and show only selected results .    in order to judge a model s fit to the data",
    ", we must consider how our one - zone , instantaneous mixing model fits into a larger picture which acknowledges the the presence of real scatter in n  o . as pointed out by pilyugin , well - mixed regions , have relaxed from self - enrichment effects and lie on upper envelope of the n  o data .",
    "that is , points on the upper envelope of the n ",
    "o data should come from systems that have had sufficient time for low - mass star products to `` catch up '' with those of high - mass stars ( see discussion in ",
    "[ sect : scatter ] ) .",
    "thus a good fit from our models should lie close to this envelope ( within errors ) , and not through the full data set . on the other hand ,",
    "since current data does not support evidence for scatter in helium , good models should fit the central trends of helium versus n / h and o / h .",
    "the goal of our study is to determine which models can best fit all of the heno data simultaneously and as we shall see , to identify weak spots in the theoretical input which may be responsible for poorly fit data . in this section ,",
    "we consider the case in which there are outflows , with a standard set of nucleosynthesis yields ( i.e. , the tabulations described in the  [ sect : model ] , with linear interpolation between agb stars and supernovae in the @xmath2 range ) .",
    "a model thus requires specification of a star formation rate , as well as four parameters : ( 1 ) the imf ; ( 2 ) the strength of the bulk ism outflow @xmath95 , ( 3 ) the supernova ejection efficiency @xmath90 ; and ( 4 ) the degree of hot bottom burning @xmath84 .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "we will consider both smooth and bursting star formation rates ; in fact , we will find that the basic model trends are not sensitive to the details of the star formation rates .",
    "for a given star formation rate , we try several different imfs . for each imf",
    ", we pick a range of @xmath95 and @xmath90 . finally , we adjust the remaining parameter , @xmath84 , to get an acceptable fit to n  o ( if this is possible ) .",
    "the models that fit n  o we deem `` good candidates '' in that they fit the metal evolution , and we then examine their helium evolution .    to summarize model results , we quote average slopes @xmath32 .",
    "we compute these slopes in a manner exactly analogous to the fits to the b98 data set ( tables [ tab : y_fit ] and [ tab : no_fit ] ) , as follows .",
    "the models produce a series of abundance points , one at each timestep .",
    "we isolate each of the model points within the b98 metallicity range : @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ( the lower limits correspond to the lowest measured metallicities , and the upper limits are from the definition of the b98 set ) . with these model points , we perform a least squares linear fit to compute the slope and intercept .",
    "we begin with the simple and instructive case of models with a smooth star formation rate .",
    "of course , bcgs demonstrate bursts of star formation , the transient effects of which we will miss .",
    "however , we will see that a smooth star formation rate provides a good `` ensemble average '' of this stochastic behavior . for the smooth rate ,",
    "we adopt @xmath98 , with @xmath99 ; our results are insensitive to the value of @xmath100 .",
    "we will examine these models with and without bulk mass loss , i.e. , with @xmath95 both zero and nonzero ; in fact , we will find that the results are insensitive to @xmath95 .",
    "we turn first to models with an imf given by @xmath101 .",
    "we will use this over a mass range @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath90 is allowed to vary from 0 to 0.9 and results appear in table [ tab : std_imf ] .",

    "figure [ fig : imf_dep ] illustrates these results for @xmath121 . in all cases , we take @xmath102 .",
    "a comparison with the previous results shows that , all other parameters being equal , the steeper imf slope gives larger helium slopes .",

    "note that other than larger overall slopes , the basic trends are the same as for the less steep imf .    for all",
    "adopted imfs , we find that the helium slopes do increase with the enriched outflow strength , but never become as large as the slopes in the data fits .",
    "this trend is common to most models we have explored .",
    "indeed , we can reproduce the observed slopes only a few cases with alternative yields , discussed below (  [ sect : alt_yield ] ) .",
    "however , we can already make some conclusions regarding the behavior of models with the fiducial yields we have adopted .",
    "first , these models predict a n  o evolution that is close to linear , and @xmath30 evolution that is also very close to linear in both o and n. it is thus clear that chemical evolution models can support that linear behavior that is the simplest interpretation of the data , and has been used in the fits to derive . since these models do not reproduce the slopes quantitatively",
    ", one can not infer that a successful model would _ demand _ linearity , but it is at least clear that linear evolution of @xmath30 versus metals is the typical result of a broad set of models .",
    "since our models give very linear @xmath7n and @xmath7o trends , it also follows that these models do not predict a significant difference in slope between the lower and higher metallicity bcg points .",
    "that is , these models do not predict a difference between the slopes in the b versus c data sets .",
    "the linearity of models @xmath7n , o further implies that the models do not predict that the extrapolated intercepts@xmath10(n ) and @xmath10(o)should differ significantly from the true @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , we find this to be the case , not just for oxygen but also for nitrogen : the errors one expects from linear extrapolations are small , @xmath123 for all models .",
    "this is in contrast to the data , for which @xmath124 .",
    "our results thus differ from those of fields , who found that @xmath125 as large as @xmath126 for models in which an explicitly secondary source of n was put in by hand . here , however , we have adhered to the tabulated van den hoek & groenewegen yields , which include hot bottom burning , and thus some some degree of secondary n. we find , however , that the secondary n component in our results is weak .",
    "furthermore , the small @xmath0n slopes in our models force the extrapolated @xmath10(n ) to be accurate , independent of any effects due to secondary n.    although the model slopes do fall below the data regressions , it is nevertheless noteworthy that the model curves run through most of the data s error bars  i.e . , the @xmath33 is not bad . thus , while these models are not good fits to the data , they are not strongly excluded by the data either .",
    "this comes about because the observational errors in the individual helium abundances are large compared to the change @xmath127 over a small baseline in metallicity . as a result , even a small slope can not be strongly ruled out unless one considers higher metallicity points , where there is more leverage to compare the slopes .",
    "thus , the bcg observational `` wish list '' for addressing these chemical evolution issues is some different than that for obtaining primordial helium .",
    "chemical evolution is best constrained by data over a large range of metallicities , whereas primordial helium is best obtained via the systems with the lowest possible metallicities .",
    "we should note at this point that the he data of izotov & thuan , based on the observation of 5 he lines , does indicate a smaller @xmath0o slope , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : data ] .",
    "as one can see from the tables , a slope of @xmath128 is not hard to accommodate in any of the models considered .",
    "although we believe the uncertainties with this approach to be large , we should not exclude the possibility that the discrepancy in the slopes has its source in the he data .    with these caveats in mind",
    ", we identify the best models having our fiducial yields .",
    "the best model with the @xmath129 imf has @xmath130 ( if we include carbon evolution as a constraint , @xmath121 is the maximum allowable ) .",
    "the slopes in this model are @xmath131 , and @xmath132 which respectively are @xmath1 and @xmath133 away from the data regressions .",
    "the favored value of @xmath134 comes about as follows .",
    "a larger @xmath90 would lead to larger helium slopes more in line with the data .",
    "however , as @xmath135 , the systems loses so much of its heavy element products that it no longer can achieve metallicities observed in bcgs ( e.g. , for @xmath136 , when the gas fraction dips below 5% , o / h is only @xmath137 ; observed values are as high as @xmath138 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath130 is similar to values obtained in other studies of bcg models , and in some models of galactic outflows . also , this value is in line with those found by mac low & ferrara .",
    "the only models significantly better than this are the ones with the steepest imf , @xmath139 , we note that these models require that the enriched outflow efficiency must be very small @xmath140 in order to reproduce the observed bcg metallicities .",
    "further , these models have trouble reproducing the highest observed metallicities , and have c abundances which are much larger than the available observations ( see below , this section ) .",
    "it is of interest to point out model parameters that do _ not _ have a strong impact on the results .",
    "one is the character of the star formation rate .",
    "as seen in table [ tab : std_imf ] the results are quite insensitive to whether a smooth or bursting star formation rate is used .",
    "this is not to say that the bursting star formation rates give the same results in detail .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : sfr_dep ] , the bursting star formation leads to a `` stairstep '' evolution in the n  o plane in contrast to the smooth curve for the smooth star formation rate .",
    "while the curves are locally very different , they are globally very similar  the bursting trend is a variation around the smooth one . in particular , the smooth evolution lies on the upper envelope of the bursting one .",
    "this justifies the self - consistency of our approach to fitting the data : we have assumed that the n  o scatter is real and due to self - enrichment effects of bursting , so we have fit the upper envelope of the data .",
    "furthermore , since different bcgs undergo different numbers and magnitudes of bursts , a smooth star formation rate can be seen as an `` ensemble average '' over different bursting histories .",
    "this simple , smooth star formation rate is valid long as one is careful to fit the upper envelope of the n  o data .",
    "we note that these issues are not relevant for the he evolution ; there , the differences between the bursting and smooth evolution curves are negligible .",
    "our conclusion in these regards thus agrees with those of pilyugin .",
    "even less important for our results is the bulk ism outflow .",
    "as seen in table [ tab : std_imf ] , the results for @xmath141 and @xmath142 are essentially indistinguishable for all but a few cases . this is due to the democratic character of the bulk outflow ,",
    "whose composition is the same as that of the ism .",
    "indeed , in the instantaneous recycling approximation , such an outflow leads to a uniform reduction in the effective yields by a factor @xmath143 , and thus there is no effect in element _ ratios _ or the abundance  abundance trends of interest here .",
    "we see here that even without instantaneous recycling , @xmath144 only has an impact when @xmath90 is large . in this case",
    ", the extremely reduced effective yields feed back to the metallicity dependent yields , and so modify the helium slopes .    finally , we turn to the evolution of carbon in our models .",
    "carigi et al .",
    "noted the importance of c / o as a constraint on the high - mass stellar cutoff @xmath145 , and on enriched winds .",
    "here we note the importance of c in constraining intermediate - mass nucleosynthesis .",
    "figure [ fig : carbon ] plots c versus o , and @xmath30 versus c , for our best heno models at each imf slope .",
    "note that c is high in models with high @xmath84 , i.e. , when hot bottom burning is reduced .",
    "this comes about due to a tradeoff between c and n  hot bottom burning produced n at the expense of c. thus , the models that have less hot bottom burning ( to improve the fit to the n  o data ) also have high carbon , often above the c  o data .",
    "a good compromise appears to be around @xmath146 for both power - law imfs .",
    "thus , the c  o data prevents one from adopting arbitrarily little hot bottom burning ( i.e. , large @xmath84 ) ; furthermore , @xmath84 correlates with @xmath90 in acceptable heno models , and so the c  o effectively constrains the level of enriched outflows .",
    "carbon can be a very strong and useful constraint on bcg models .",
    "the carbon data generally support the idea of self - enrichment as a source of the n ",
    "o scatter .",
    "kobulnicky & skillman , measure c / h in three bcgs which have roughly the same o / h but different n / o .",
    "kobulnicky & skillman find c / h variations , which are correlated with n / o  i.e .",
    ", these galaxies have similar n / c ratios .",
    "this suggests that the nucleosynthesis of these two elements is linked  as we indeed expect : both come from intermediate - mass stars .",
    "furthermore , this result is consistent with the self - enrichment ( `` delayed release '' in the parlance of kobulnicky & skillman ) scheme for the n  o scatter (  [ sect : scatter ] ) . complicating this picture are the results of garnett et al .  .",
    "they measured c / h in the very low metallicity i zw 18 , and found @xmath147 which gives [ c / o]@xmath148 .",
    "this is high compared to other low - metallicity bcgs ( @xmath149 ) , and much higher than massive star models predict .",
    "garnett et al .",
    "interpret this as evidence for prior star formation and ejection of intermediate mass star products .",
    "if so , then in the self - enrichment picture the high c / o ratio suggests that the previous star formation has now returned all of its ejecta , and so this c / o is more representative of the smooth star forming average .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the trends in our results ( e.g. , the effect of bulk and enriched outflows , or of the imf ) are in broad agreement with the recent work of pilyugin ; matteucci & tosi ; carigi et al .  .",
    "it is of particular interest to compare our results to the recent models of pilyugin .",
    "his models employ differential stellar winds , and are more detailed than ours in that they distinguish the abundances in the bulk bcg gas and the star forming  regions .",
    "pilyugin thus models the effects of self - enrichment , and finds that while the predicted n  o scatter is large , the @xmath7n , o scatter is smaller , in line with our results .",
    "it was noted in ( fields @xcite ) that although @xmath2 yields are uncertain , they could have a large effect on helium production . in particular , it is unclear what fate meets stars born in these objects .",
    "stellar evolution models for this mass range are uncertain and are difficult to construct .",
    "indeed , modern tabulated yields for either agb stars or for type ii supernovae generally omit this mass range . while it is considered likely that @xmath2 objects explode as electron - capture supernovae ( nomoto @xcite ; iben , ritossa , & garca - berro @xcite )",
    ", the composition of the ejecta is unclear ( e.g. , wheeler , cowan , & hillebrandt @xcite propose these objects as the site of the r - process ) .",
    "woosley & weaver suggested that these objects might be supernovae whose predominant product is helium , with very small metal yields .",
    "indeed , this is the trend down to the limits of the core collapse models .",
    "if this is the case , it could significantly increase the helium yield , given the large imf weighting of this mass range compared to that of the better known , high mass supernovae .    to investigate this possibility , we adopt a modified form of the approximation of fields .",
    "namely , we assume 8  is the lower limit for supernova production ( this is important in determining the wind strength via eqs .",
    "[ eq : wind_ism ] and [ eq : wind_sn ] ) .",
    "we assume the yield at 8  is `` all '' 4 , i.e. , any portion of the helium core that is ejected contains only 4 , while the envelope remains that of the ism at the star s birth .",
    "we fix the yield at 11  as that of woosley & weaver . between these extrema",
    ", we determine the yields via linear interpolation .",
    "this differs from the procedure of section ",
    "[ sect : outflow ] , which uses the 8 van den hoek & groenewegen yields in the interpolation .",
    "thus our modification trades a decrease in c and n for an increase in he .",
    "we see by comparing the results of table 5 with those of tables 3 and 4 , that adding enhanced @xmath150 he production does increase the slopes , but only mildly .",
    "though the yield modifications which give rise to this portion of table [ tab : alt_yields ] are , in our opinion , plausible , and help ameliorate the disagreement between observation and theory . these changes are not , however , the solution to the problem .",

    "traat pointed out that maeder s yields can give large he slopes , but only when used in combination with scalo s imf .",
    "to investigate this claim , we replaced our fiducial yields with those of maeder ; these include stars from @xmath153 .",
    "these yields are based on the schaller et al .",
    "models go up to the early asymptotic giant branch ( e - agb ) phase for intermediate - mass stars , and up through central c burning for massive stars .",
    "thus , these models do not provide a detailed treatment of agb evolution and nucleosynthesis in intermediate - mass stars , nor of the advanced and explosive evolution of massive stars .",
    "in fact , the schaller et al .",
    "models , that are the basis of the maeder , provide the initial conditions for the agb studies of van den hoek & groenewegen .    since maeder",
    "does not provide n yields , a complete comparison with our fiducial yields is impossible .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt the maeder yields for he and o , which are tabulated for @xmath154 and @xmath155 . as seen in table [ tab : alt_yields ] and in figure [ fig : yield_dep ] , the slopes for power law imfs are somewhat increased relative to our fiducial models , but the effect is relatively small  not enough to bring agreement with the data .",
    "however , in the case of a log - normal imf , the change is indeed large , as discussed by traat , and in contrast to our fiducial case which does not strongly change with this imf .",
    "we find that slopes now come within @xmath156 of the data regressions , in the case without enriched winds ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the slope increases when enriched winds are invoked , and for @xmath158 , the slopes lie comfortably in the range of observations .",
    "while this increase is tantalizing , it is not so clear that this puts and end to the slope problem .",
    "it is troubling that models which treat the advanced phases of stellar evolution in a more detailed way are unable to reproduce the large slopes . at any rate",
    ", this points up : ( 1 ) the sensitivity of our results to yields , ( 2 ) the need for accurate nucleosynthesis models , and ( 2 ) the likelihood that a problem with yields lies at the heart of the slope problem , so long as the slopes inferred from the data are taken at face value .",
    "we have also considered the effect of massive star winds on our models .",
    "following fields , we used the maeder @xcite tabulation of stellar wind yields ( which do include n ) in conjunction with our fiducial massive star yields of woosley & weaver @xcite .",
    "we found that in fact , the stellar winds slightly lowered the helium slopes , since increase in he production more than offset by increase in n and o. this conclusion is consistent with that of fields .",
    "this is perhaps not a surprise since the effects of winds are generally small at the low values of @xmath17 we are considering .",
    "another proposal to increase the predicted helium slopes appeals to a change in yields via an effective change in the imf mass limits .",
    "namely , the oxygen yields are reduced if one lowers @xmath145 , the upper mass limit for stars formed . but an increased @xmath159 .",
    "this change has only a modest effect , in the direction of further lowering the he slopes . ]",
    "following olive , thielemann , & truran , maeder has suggested that while stars may still be formed up to @xmath160 or even higher , but that stars more massive to some cutoff @xmath161 will become black holes during core collapse , and will not return their nucleosynthesis products . for our purposes , adopting a @xmath162 is just equivalent to lowering @xmath145 .",
    "we have run models with @xmath163 ; results appear in table [ tab : alt_yields ] .",
    "because high mass star yields are reduced , a good fit to n  o requires less hot bottom burning ( i.e. , higher @xmath84 ) than in models with our fiducial @xmath164 .",
    "we find that @xmath105 is required for @xmath121 ; for the case , the change in the mass limit does indeed raise the helium slopes , to @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "these are in marginal agreement with the data .",
    "( lowering @xmath145 further to @xmath167 does not help : the @xmath157 slopes are @xmath168 and @xmath169 , but the n  o data already requires the minimum hot bottom burning , @xmath105 , so enriched outflow can not be invoked to improve these results . )",
    "however , as noted at the end of  [ sect : results ] , the low degree of hot bottom burning in this model is unable to reproduce the c  o relation .",
    "if the carbon data are to be taken seriously ( and certainly if they improve ) then one has to adopt a lower @xmath84 , and hence a lower @xmath90 , and this scenario become ineffective in generating large helium slopes .",
    "this underscores the power of carbon in particular , and multiple element abundances in general , to constrain bcg chemical evolution models .",
    "finally , we note that issues of stellar yields probably underlie a notable contrast between our findings and those of pilyugin .",
    "pilyugin s calculations , unlike ours , are able to achieve large @xmath0n and @xmath0o while still fitting n  o .",
    "we strongly suspect that this crucial difference stems from our different choices for massive stellar yields .",
    "pilyugin adopts the yields of chiosi & caimmi , which themselves are re - analyses of older tabulations , corrected to reflect the effects of a very strong mass loss rate .",
    "chiosi & caimmi argued that strong mass loss should occur in essentially all massive stars , and thus readjusted the relation between the he core mass and the progenitor mass to reflect this and to rescale the yields .",
    "the upshot of this rescaling is that stars of a given initial mass lose more material , and so have smaller he cores and thus smaller heavy element yields .",
    "for example , chiosi & caimmi estimate that the oxygen yield of a @xmath170 star is reduced from @xmath171 in a model without winds , to @xmath172 with winds . clearly , a reduction this sharp leads to a dramatic increase in @xmath0o ( or equivalently , @xmath9 ) , as pilyugin indeed finds .",
    "however , there is not evidence for such a strong effect in more modern supernova codes : neither in woosley & weaver , nor even in the models of maeder , who includes stellar winds but finds their effect to be small below @xmath173 .",
    "the helium slope versus metallicity , @xmath9 , has long been viewed as a significant test of chemical evolution models of bcgs as well as our own galaxy .",
    "it is indeed worrying that models have consistently had trouble reproducing the observed slopes in either of these systems since generic models tend to produce @xmath174 .",
    "our preceding discussion has compared the bcg helium slopes as observed and as calculated our model ; here we discuss the relation of this work to the situation in our galaxy .",
    "studies of @xmath9 in our galaxy have focussed on the `` fine structure '' in the main sequence of nearby stars ( e.g. , pagel & portinari @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this analysis notes the dependence of stellar luminosity , at fixed effective temperature , on the composition . using hipparchos parallax data to obtain accurate luminosities ,",
    "pagel & portinari infer @xmath175 . for comparison ,",
    "solar system determinations of metallicity ( anders & grevesse @xcite ) and protosolar helium ( bahcall & pinsonneault @xcite ) would imply a @xmath176 ( adopting @xmath85 ) .",
    "these galactic determinations are below those from bcgs , though the uncertainties are large .",
    "if the slopes for these two systems can be shown to differ , it could be a consequence of the different environments and star forming histories of these systems .",
    "the connection one expects between the galactic and extragalactic observed slopes depends on how one models the chemical evolution of both systems .",
    "for example , if one favors bcg models which invoke enriched outflows , but galactic models that do not , one indeed expects a slope that is smaller for galaxy . if enriched outflows are not important for bcgs , or are present in our own galaxy with similar efficiencies , than the galactic and extragalactic slopes should be the same ( although the galactic data is for stars with higher metallicity than in bcgs ) .    on the theoretical side , our results have implications for galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "we find that standard imfs and up - to - date yields generically give @xmath177 , including those models without enriched winds ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "thus , even if the galaxy had no such winds , this basic result obtains . adding primordial",
    "infall does not affect the situation to first order , though the overall suppression of metallicity would somewhat lower the n yields and thus augment @xmath0n ( without changing @xmath0o appreciably ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the imf and yield choices we have adopted may have trouble with the the galactic helium slopes ( @xmath178 ) , as well as those of bcgs .",
    "we note in passing that the small scatter in the @xmath7n , o trend could point to the uniformity of the enriched wind efficiency over different bcgs .",
    "that is , the slope @xmath0o is very sensitive to @xmath90 ; if different systems had very different @xmath90 , then at a fixed o / h , one would expect a large range of @xmath30 , and thus the @xmath179 trend would have a large intrinsic scatter .",
    "the fact that it does not suggests that @xmath90 does not vary much .",
    "we have considered the chemical evolution of bcgs , through an analysis of the observed heno abundances , and by studying chemical evolution models .",
    "our basic conclusions are as follows .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath7n and @xmath7o data is entirely consistent with the observational errors . in particular",
    ", these data do not show the correlations ( in the n  o plane ) that one would expect if the scatter were due to self - enrichment by massive star ejecta . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that the n  o scatter real .",
    "we expect that at least some of the observed scatter is due to self - enrichment , as is also suggested by the observed correlation of high c / o systems with high n / o .",
    "our study of chemical evolution models of bcgs concludes that the favored models for these systems ( i.e. , including outflows ) , coupled with recent and detailed stellar yield calculations ( which are metallicity dependent ) , are not successful in reproducing simultaneously all of the abundance trends . we do find that in general , the models do predict linear slopes in he versus n and o , as has long been assumed in phenomenological fits to the data .",
    "the large slopes are , however , hard to reproduce quantitatively  even in models with supernova - enriched outflows .",
    "the only models which _ can _ produce large slopes , while ( possibly ) maintaining agreement with n  o data , are those using the ( less detailed ) stellar yields of maeder in combination with a log - normal imf .",
    "consequently , we suspect that the root of the problem lies in the nucleosynthesis inputs , particularly the he yields .",
    "we emphasize that any means of improving the helium slopes must be tested in models which fit _ all _ of heno , and preferably c as well .",
    "another shortcoming of the models regards nitrogen .",
    "we find that the models with the detailed yields typically do not predict a strong enough secondary character for n versus o. as a result , they do not find that the @xmath180n slopes change much with metallicity . in particular , the models do not reproduce the differences found in the @xmath7n slopes ( and intercepts ) between the full and low - metallicity data sets .    despite these unresolved issues ,",
    "our study of bcg models does allow us to draw some conclusions .",
    "most models with detailed yields predicted @xmath7n , o relations that were close to linear ; this gives some theoretical justification for the adoption linear regressions of the data ( particularly for @xmath30o ) .",
    "also , we confirm that the nature of the star formation rate  bursting versus smooth  does strongly affect the detailed evolutionary history , and an ensemble of different histories leads to significant scatter in n  o . fortunately , however , the n  o evolution in the smooth star forming history forms an upper envelope to the n  o trends in the bursting models . thus",
    ", if one is not interested in the scatter , one can adopt a smooth star forming model as long as one is careful to fit appropriate envelope of the data .",
    "we have also shown that carbon data provides an important additional constraint on bcg chemical evolution .",
    "in particular , c and n together can diagnose the tradeoff between c and n controlled by hot bottom burning .",
    "additional c observations would be very useful in further constraining bcg models .",
    "finally , aspects of our results have implications for systems other than bgcs .",
    "the difficulty for our models to reproduce the helium slopes probably carries over to our own galaxy .",
    "although there is some evidence that the galactic @xmath9 may be lower than in bcgs , it nevertheless seems to exceed the values ( @xmath181 ) consistently predicted by all of our models without strong enriched winds .",
    "a good solar neighborhood @xmath9 would help illuminate whether the helium slope problem is due to yields , or due to environmental differences between the galaxy and bcgs .",
    "finally , we note the similarity between the low metallicity n  o evolution in bcgs , qso absorbers ( c.f .",
    "lu , sargent , & barlow @xcite ) , and other external galaxies ( van zee , salzer , & haynes @xcite ) .",
    "the observed trends are compatible with each other , at least to a first approximation .",
    "this suggests that the n  o evolution of these objects is similar , which may then imply that the enriched outflow of bcgs is small .",
    "if so , this is additional evidence that the heart of the problem of the low helium slopes lies in the stellar yields themselves .",
    "we are grateful for discussions with sean scully , evan skillman , gary steigman , and don garnett .",
