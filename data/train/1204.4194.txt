    "understanding when and how the most massive galaxies formed remains one of the most outstanding problems in galaxy formation . in the present - day universe , most massive galaxies ( @xmath9 ) are early - type galaxies @xcite , which are primarily composed of old stellar populations with no or little star formation .",
    "spectroscopic studies of large local samples reveal that the bulk of stellar mass in massive early - type galaxies was formed at @xmath10 within a short timescale ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) . at intermediate redshifts , several surveys reveal that the precursors of present - day massive early - type galaxies have already turned passive by @xmath11 , but may continue to assemble their stellar mass later through dry mergers @xcite . the lack of significant star formation in these galaxies since @xmath12 implies that their stellar mass formed at higher redshifts . recently ,",
    "both observational and theoretical results suggest that the critical epoch for massive galaxy evolution and mass assembly is at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "thus , a complete census of a well - defined massive galaxy sample at this redshift range is crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of these objects .",
    "significant progress has been made in detecting and identifying massive galaxies at @xmath14 using large - format near - infrared ( nir ) array cameras on 4@xmath710 m class telescopes .",
    "recent wide - field nir surveys reveal several `` new '' galaxy populations , which includes extremely red objects ( eros ; @xmath15 , @xcite ) , irac - selected eros ( @xmath16$]>@xmath17 is the f850lp band magnitude . ] , @xcite ) , bzks ( sbzk:@xmath18 , pbzk : @xmath19 ; @xcite ) , and distant red galaxies ( drgs , @xmath20 , @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxy populations are mainly selected on the basis of their red rest - frame optical colors , and have typical stellar masses in excess of @xmath21 down to current nir limits . moreover",
    ", various studies show that they dominate the high - mass regime of the @xmath22 stellar mass function ( smf ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggested that eros contribute 75% of all @xmath23@xmath24 galaxies at @xmath25 down to @xmath26 = 19.7 , while @xcite found a similar fraction for drgs in the range of @xmath27 .",
    "this makes red color selection an efficient and effective way of studying massive high - redshift galaxies .",
    "utilizing these novel techniques for identifying high - redshift massive galaxies , a great deal of work has been carried out to explore their nature .",
    "these galaxies turn to be very different from their local counterparts .",
    "first , star formation activities were more intense at higher redshifts .",
    "at @xmath22 , more than half of the massive galaxies are rapidly star - forming galaxies with @xmath28 100@xmath24yr@xmath29 while the remaining are quiescent galaxies with no or little ongoing star - formation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath30 most of the galaxies with similar mass are quiescent galaxies .",
    "second , while the cosmic mass density in massive star - forming galaxies is flat or decreases from @xmath22 to the present day , the mass density in massive quiescent galaxies increases by a factor of @xmath31 10 over the same time period .",
    "such dramatic evolution can not be fully explained by modest mass growth of individual quiescent galaxies .",
    "transformation of the star - forming galaxies into quiescent galaxies is indispensable to match this density evolution of quiescent galaxies , as well as that of star - forming galaxies themselves ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "understanding this transformation is now one of the central questions in studying galaxy evolution .    to study the physical mechanisms responsible for this transformation , it is essential to classify galaxies into different types .",
    "though a clear bimodal color distribution between quiescent and star - forming galaxies persists to at least @xmath32 , the bimodality becomes less distinct at the high - mass end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be largely attributed to an increase in dust content in the massive star - forming galaxies which reddens their colors @xcite .",
    "the dust reddening turns to be more significant at higher redshifts due to increasing importance of obscured star - formation . at @xmath22 most massive star - forming galaxies",
    "have very red optical - to - infrared colors .",
    "indeed , these star - forming galaxies have such red colors that they are prematurely on the red sequence @xcite .",
    "a number of other methods were proposed to separate the two populations , using for example , observed colors @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 @xcite , rest - frame colors @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 @xcite , mid - infrared colors @xcite , or directly using output spectral types and specific star - formation rates ( ssfr ] ) from the sed fitting process @xcite .",
    "each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages , and they can give different classification results for a significant number of galaxies . resolving these discrepancies",
    "is important for us to have a clean separation of quiescent and star - forming populations .",
    "moreover , the fraction of agns among massive galaxies at @xmath22 is high , up to @xmath31 30% ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "agn activity can also contribute to the infrared emission , which is used to identify star - forming galaxies in most of the classification methods .",
    "thus a comprehensive identification of agn population is necessary for a better understanding of galaxy classification .",
    "in addition to the star - formation status , morphologies provide important constrains on the galaxy assembly history and are crucial to distinguish among models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "studies of morphologies for high - redshift galaxies have greatly advanced in the last decade @xcite .",
    "several recent work present evidence that galaxy morphologies are correlated with star - forming status for galaxies at @xmath22 : quiescent galaxies tend to be spheroidal and compact while star - forming galaxies are mostly disks or irregular / mergers with larger sizes @xcite .",
    "however , this correlation at @xmath22 shows large scatter and is far from clear",
    ". a significant number of systems are classified as having the same star - formation status yet with different morphological types ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the new @xmath0/wfc3 nir imaging , @xcite shows that @xmath31 65% of quiescent galaxies are actually disk - dominated ( also see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though their sample is small . moreover , many of these work characterized galaxy structures with the srsic index obtained by fitting a srsic model to the surface brightness data , i.e. , a model - dependent approach .",
    "yet there are concerns whether the profile of a high - redshift galaxy can be well fitted with a single srsic profile @xcite .",
    "thus other methods , including both visual classification and model - independent measurement of galaxy morphology , are needed to probe the relationship between galaxy morphology and their physical properties .",
    "nevertheless , this requires high - resolution and high signal - to - nosie nir ( rest - frame optical ) imaging for a statistical sample of @xmath22 galaxies , which now becomes available thanks to the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; pi : sandra m. faber and henry c. ferguson , cf , * ? ? ?",

    "allows us to have a better separation between quiescent galaxies , star - forming galaxies , and agns .",

    "the ultradeep irac imaging of goods - s covers the whole @xmath44 region ( dickinson et al . , in preparation ) and has an exposure time of 23 hrs per pointing , yielding a 5@xmath45 limiting magnitude of [ 3.6 ] @xmath31 25.6 .",

    "the 3@xmath45 point - source sensitivity limit is @xmath3110@xmath52 , permitting detection of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) with @xmath53 out to @xmath54 . on the other hand , the 24 @xmath46 emission from a galaxy",
    "can also be powered by an agn , which can be identified by deep x - ray observations .",
    "the recent 4 ms @xmath1 imaging in the goods - s , the deepest @xmath1 survey ever obtained , reaches on - axis flux limits of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and 5.5 @xmath5710@xmath58 erg @xmath59 s@xmath29 for the full ( @xmath60 kev ) , soft ( @xmath61 kev ) , and hard bands ( @xmath62 kev ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "these deep x - ray data permit detection of even highly obscured agns .",
    "a major breakthrough in deep imaging of goods - s comes from two recent _",
    "nir surveys : the wfc3 early release science ( ers , @xcite ) program and the first phase of the candels survey .",
    "the ers mosaic covers the northern @xmath63 region of goods - s while the candels dataset covers the southern @xmath64 region .",
    "both surveys reach 5@xmath45 limiting magnitude of @xmath28 27.0 in f160w ( @xmath49-band ) , providing high - quality structural information ( concentrations , gini / m@xmath8 ) for galaxies as faint as @xmath49 = 24.6 , which is equivalent to 2 @xmath57 10@xmath65 at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ch12_z36_sed ] also shows the distribution of their [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 4.5 ] colors for this sample , which can be used to constrain their redshifts .",
    "most galaxies in the sample have [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 4.5 ] @xmath75 0 , indicating that they are mainly at @xmath76 @xmath28 1.5 when the 1.6 @xmath46 stellar emission bump begins to move into the irac 4.5 @xmath46 band @xcite .",
    "their photometric redshifts are presented in section [ photoz ] .",
    "we have shown that the ieros tend to be either quiescent galaxies ( quiescents ) or dusty star - forming galaxies ( dsfgs ) at @xmath77 .",
    "however , it is difficult to separate them solely based on observed uv - to - nir seds . instead , the mid - infrared , e.g.",
    ", the mips 24 @xmath46 , traces star - forming activity across a wide range of redshifts , and can be used to separate these two populations @xcite . in particular , in redshift @xmath78 the 7.7 @xmath46 pah emission shifts into the observed 24 @xmath46 , allowing a universal conversion of 24 @xmath46 flux into star - formation rate ( sfr,@xcite ) . on the other hand , the irac 3.6 @xmath46 in this redshift range probes rest - frame nir , which can be treated as a good proxy for stellar mass @xcite .",
    "thus we argue that the [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] color provides a good indicator of specific star - formation rates ( ssfr ) for galaxies in this sample .",

    "this criterion is consistent with that used in @xcite ) yr@xmath29 to select quiescents , where @xmath83 is the age of the universe at a given redshift .",

    "] we also verified that by changing the [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] color criterion within a scatter of 0.2 , the numbers in the quiescents and dsfgs population changed at most @xmath3110% , and our main conclusions drawn in this paper remain valid .",
    "in several cases , 24 @xmath46 emission may be very weak or absent even for dsfgs . at @xmath871.4 , the silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath46 shifts in the mips 24 @xmath46 band . thus sfgs with a strong silicate absorption feature",
    "may have no 24 @xmath46 detection at this redshift @xcite .",
    "we thus propose another k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] color to at @xmath22 , k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] probes rest - frame @xmath88 , which is sensitive to dust extinction .",
    "dsfgs have redder k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] colors compared to quiescents at similar redshifts , as shown by the color tracks of a quiescent and a dsfg sed template in figure  [ k36_ch15]a .",
    "most objects in our sample with @xmath42 - [ 24 ] < 0.3 $ ] have blue k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] , but a few of them have very red k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] ( see galaxies to left of dashed line in figure  [ k36_ch15](a ) ) .",
    "photometric redshifts for these sources confirm that they are at @xmath89 or at very high redshift , @xmath90 , where 24@xmath46 is not sensitive to star formation .",
    "we argue that these sources are really dsfgs .",
    "we therefore propose the observable color criteria for identification of quiescents in the sample as :      the remaining objects are denoted as dsfgs .",
    "we note that though the adopted @xmath92 $ ] color criterion is empirical , the number of these 24 @xmath93faint dsfgs is very small and have redshifts beyond our main interests .",
    "based on eq  [ eq : ir_color ] , a total of 90 galaxies , 68% of the whole sample , are classified as dsfgs ; 43 galaxies , 32% of the whole sample , are quiescents .",
    "the median [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] colors for the two populations are @xmath31 2.2 and @xmath70.5 , respectively , indicating that their ssfrs are significantly different . in fact , those galaxies with [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] @xmath75 0.3 have a median 24 @xmath46 flux density of @xmath31 125 @xmath52 , implying that a significant fraction of them are ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) at @xmath22 .",
    "roughly 30% of this iero sample , 38 sources , are detected at x - ray , all of which are classified as agns according to their x - ray luminosities in @xcite . among these x - ray ieros ,",
    "79% are dsfgs and the remaining 21% are quiescents .",
    "we do note that quiescent galaxies with agns , which can also have strong 24 @xmath46 emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may be misidentified as dsfgs .",
    "as shown in figure  [ k36_ch15]b , several agns even show very blue k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] contrary to their red [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] .",
    "further classification of these x - ray ieros will be performed using their morphologies and rest - frame colors .",
    "galaxy morphologies provide additional information on the mass assembly history of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we performed both visual classifications and nonparametric morphological measurements to see whether quiescents and dsfgs in our sample can be separated based on their morphologies . all morphological analysis in this work",
    "are based on the candels 6-epoch v2.0 drizzled mosaics for the wfc3 f160w band , with a pixel scale of @xmath94 ,      the ieros in our sample show very diversified morphologies , covering a wide range of types from extended and disturbed low surface brightness features to bulge - dominated morphology .",
    "we divide morphological types for this sample into three broad categories :    * _ spheroid _ * : single , round , and centrally concentrated source with no evidence of extended low surface brightness features .",
    "* _ disk _ * : undisturbed source with extended low surface brightness features .",
    "* _ irregular / merger _ * : single highly irregular galaxy with evidence of non - axisymmetric , extended low surface - brightness features or two or more distinct galaxies showing distortions and interaction features such as tidal arms .",
    "figure  [ mor_example ] shows typical examples of the three types in the wfc3 f160w images .",
    "visual inspections for this sample were performed by three of the co - authors independently .",
    "we combined the classifications from each inspector and reviewed the sources together to resolve the disagreements , which involved @xmath31 15% of the sample .",
    "the final visual morphological types are listed in table  [ tab : mor ] .",
    "about 40% of this sample are classified as disk galaxies , 30% are spheroids and the remaining 30% are irregular / mergers .",
    "the x - ray sources have the similar fractions of disk , spheroid and irregular / merger types : 45% , 20% and 35% respectively .",
    "most of the x - ray sources show a bulge component even they are identified as disk galaxies ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "we present f160w images for quiescents and dsfgs in figures  [ h_fire_eg ] and [ h_fire_sf ] , respectively .",
    "roughly 70% of the quiescent galaxies are spheroids , and 30% of them show a significant disk component .",
    "the dsfgs , in contrast , are either regular disks or irregular / mergers , with only a few being spheroids .",
    "it should be noted that he quiescent disks are significantly different from the star - forming disks : the former also have a prominent bulge while the latter have small or no bulges .",
    "thus we can separate the two populations based on whether they have a significant bulge component : both spheroids and those disks with a prominent bulge are quiescents while the remaining galaxies are dsfgs .",
    "nonparametric morphological parameters , such as gini and m@xmath8 , have now become popular in the automated identification of galaxy morphology .",
    "these parameters do not rely on certain model parameter fits , such as the srsic index , and therefore can be applied to irregulars as well as standard hubble - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the gini coefficient is a concentration parameter , measuring the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux values .",
    "it is high for galaxies with much of their light concentrated in a small number of pixels , regardless whether those pixels are in the projected center .",
    "therefore , the gini method has the advantage that it do not require the galaxy to be circularly symmetric , and is particularly useful for galaxies at high redshifts , which can have very distorted morphologies . @xmath95 describes the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy s flux , which is very sensitive to merger signatures such as multiple nuclei , tidal tails , and off - center star clusters .",
    "gini and @xmath95 are shown to be closely related with visual morphologies for galaxies both at low and intermediate redshifts : early - type galaxies have higher gini and lower m@xmath8 while late - type galaxies have lower gini and higher m@xmath8 @xcite . at higher redshift , however , it is difficult to measure gini and @xmath95 due to a lack of high - quality nir ( rest - frame optical ) images . and their relationships with visual morphologies , as well as star - forming status remain unclear .",
    "the new wfc3 data from candels provides nir imaging with sufficient angular resolution and depth , allowing us to reliably measure gini and m@xmath8 for a representative sample of massive galaxies at @xmath22 .",
    "we calculated gini and m@xmath8 for galaxies in our sample using the wfc3 f160w images following the definition of @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of pixels within the images and @xmath98 are the fluxes for each pixel sorted in ascending order with @xmath99 , and    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xcite , where @xmath102 is the galaxy s center and @xmath103 are the fluxes for each pixel sorted in descending order with @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "details of our procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "we shows the distribution of gini and @xmath95 for our sample in figure  [ g_vs_m20 ] , with randomly selected measurements marked by their stamp images .",
    "galaxies of different visual morphological types occupy different regions in the gini - m@xmath8 diagram ( figures  [ g_vs_m20 ] and [ visual_gini_m20 ] ) .",
    "spheroids have higher gini and lower @xmath95 , while most irr / mergers have lower gini and high @xmath95 .",
    "the disks span a wide range in both gini and @xmath95 : those disks with a prominent bulge tend to have higher gini and lower @xmath95 whereas disks with small or no bulges have lower gini and higher @xmath95 .    for the non - x - ray ieros , quiescents and dsfgs",
    "are well separated in the gini - m@xmath8 diagram : nearly all quiescents have gini @xmath75 0.58 , while dsfgs have gini @xmath105 0.58 with only a few outliers . to further verify this , we re - plot figure  [ k36_ch15 ] but now with each object color - coded according to the gini coefficient , as shown in figure  [ k36_ch15_gini ] .",
    "this diagram shows that the ir color criteria used in eq  [ eq : ir_color ] to select quiescents also succeeded in choosing objects with gini @xmath28 0.58 .",
    "the three sources with [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] @xmath105 0.3 and red k @xmath7 [ 3.6 ] @xmath75 1.2 have very low gini coefficient , suggesting that they are not quiescents .",
    "x - ray ieros are plotted in figure  [ k36_ch15_gini](b ) . they show inconsistent classification between their ir colors and quantitive morphological parameters . while most of the x - ray sources in the quiescent region of figure  [ k36_ch15 ] show higher gini , . ]",
    "nine x - ray sources have gini @xmath75 0.58 yet have [ 3.6 ] @xmath7 [ 24 ] @xmath75 0.3 , placing them outside the quiescent region .",
    "there are two possible reasons for these sources to cross the line : they are quiescents with strong bulges and their 24 @xmath46 emission is from central agns , or they are dsfgs with powerful agns appearing in their @xmath49-band images and causing an increase in gini . we do notice that , however , most of these sources show a significant bulge except one source with i d 1325 appearing to be a point source ( figure  [ h_fire_sf ] ) .",
    "in fact , among all the x - ray sources in our sample , 66% ( 25 sources ) of them have @xmath106 5 @xmath57 10@xmath107",
    "erg s@xmath29 while only 15% ( 6 sources ) have @xmath108 1 @xmath57 10@xmath109 erg s@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus we argue that contamination from the agn in optical bands is not significant for most x - ray sources .",
    "those with high gini are likely caused by a significant bulge component .",
    "we will further verify this with their rest - frame colors in section  [ rest ] .    though the adopted technique has been used and tested by many previous works ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we evaluate the accuracy and reliability of gini and @xmath95 in the following ways .",
    "we have already shown that there is good correspondence between visual morphological types and their distribution in the @xmath110 diagram ( figures  [ g_vs_m20 ] and [ visual_gini_m20 ] ) .",
    "thus the @xmath110 system provides a reliable way to automatically distinguish different morphological types of galaxies in our sample .",
    "many previous works show that below a certain s / n level @xmath111 s / n @xmath112 2 , gini and @xmath95 depend on the s / n ratio and is useless for distinguishing different populations @xcite .",
    "benefiting from the bright cut , the median magnitude in the f160w band is @xmath113 .",
    "and all their images have a mean s / n per pixel @xmath111 s / n @xmath114 2 with a median of @xmath115 ( lotz et al . 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath116 and @xmath95 for our sample do not suffer s / n effect . as an independent check",
    ", we also calculated galaxy central concentration , the concentration index ( @xmath117 , @xcite ) , using also f160w images and compared it with @xmath116 ( figure  [ gini_c ] ) .",
    "our calculated @xmath117 is closely correlated with @xmath116 , consistent with that shown in previous works @xcite .",
    "this confirms that galaxies with high @xmath116 indeed are more concentrated .",
    "the @xmath118 relation shows larger scatter for objects with low concentration , mostly dsfgs .",
    "this is also expected : measurements of @xmath117 is based on simple aperture photometry , under the assumption that galaxies are circularly symmetric and have a well - defined center ; however , neither of these assumptions can be fulfilled for the dsfgs in this sample .",
    "thus we conclude that our calculated @xmath116 and @xmath95 provides reliable measurement of galaxy concentration and clumpiness for galaxies in our sample .",
    "only @xmath80 23% , 31 galaxies , of the ieros in our sample have spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath119 ) , and therefore we derive photometric redshifts ( @xmath120 ) for the rest using the standard sed fitting technique . after separating our ieros into quiescents and dsfgs , we are able to select seds accordingly to do sed fitting .",
    "we used the single stellar population ( ssp ) models of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bc03 ) to construct a template set for the quiescents .",
    "we assumed solar metallicity and calzetti extinction law @xcite in the range of @xmath121  mag .",

    "figure  [ eg_fit ] shows that the seds of the quiescent ieros in our sample are well fit by these ssp models , with best - fit ages ranging from 0.4 gyr to 4 gyr .",
    "many of them also show a rest - frame uv excess , which is likely due to an additional young stellar population component ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the uv excess does not affect the resulting photometric redshifts , which are mainly determined by the rest - frame optical - to - mir seds .",
    "the dsfgs are much more diverse in that they span a wide range in their @xmath42 - [ 24]$ ] colors and show a large variety of morphological characteristics .",
    "we fit these dusty galaxies using the `` easy and accurate zphot from yale '' ( eazy ; * ? ? ?",
    "we allow for a linear combination of six templates which can recover the entire rest - frame color space occupied by observed galaxies .",

    "we fixed their redshifts at the derived redshift , and fit the seds to a set of simple stellar population models .",
    "these models have exponentially declining star - formation histories ( sfh ) with @xmath125 gyr and @xmath126 assuming calzetti law .",
    "we adopted a salpeter @xcite initial mass function and solar metallicity .",
    "the stellar masses derived from the best - fitting template are then scaled to a kroupa imf @xcite by dividing the salpeter stellar mass by a factor of 1.6 @xcite .",
    "we have verified that by using the @xcite model instead of bc03 models , the stellar mass is systematically smaller with an offset of @xmath127 and a scatter of 0.17 .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies for @xmath22 samples @xcite .",
    "we also compared our stellar mass estimates with that derived using the approach in @xcite , which fitted three different star formation histories : a single stellar population ( ssp ) without dust , a constant star formation ( csf ) history with dust ( @xmath128 varying from 0 to 4 ) , and an exponentially declining star formation history with an e - folding timescale of 300 myr and the same range of @xmath128 .",
    "the two methods give fairly consistent results with a offset of @xmath129 and a scatter of 0.13 .",
    "the mass and redshift distributions are shown in figure  [ lmass_z ] .",
    "we also derive the mass completeness limit as a function of redshift for a 3.6 @xmath46 selected ( @xmath42 < 21.5 $ ] ) sample .",
    "this completeness limit is calculated using the full and deeper fireworks catalog following the method in @xcite .",

    "these ieros are clearly among the most massive galaxies . at @xmath133 ( where the our sample is nearly complete ; see below ) , the fraction of quiescents increases significantly from @xmath134% at @xmath135 to @xmath136% at @xmath137 ( table 1 ) , suggesting that we are seeing the quenching process in action in the most massive systems ( also see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to understand the completeness of this sample in terms of stellar mass . for this purpose",

    "the mass completeness of a flux - limited sample is clearly a function of redshift , and here we concentrate on the redshift range of @xmath139 because this is where we are most interested .",
    "as stated above , the approach for deriving stellar mass for the fireworks galaxies gives consistent results as our estimates .",
    "we find that our iero sample has recovered @xmath31 80% of the fireworks galaxies at @xmath140 within @xmath139 , as shown in figure  [ mass_limit ] .    the other 20% ( nine galaxies ) have @xmath16 < 3.25",

    "the seds of these four objects have strong agn components , which may have caused their stellar masses to be overestimated .",

    "the rest - frame colors permit additional characterization of galaxies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that quiescents and dsfgs can be separated in rest - frame @xmath35 versus @xmath36 : while both quiescents and dsfgs show red @xmath35 colors either due to old stellar populations or dust extinction , quiescents are bluer in @xmath36 due to lack of dust reddening .",
    "we computed these two colors by interpolating observed data following the algorithm of @xcite , as shown in figure  [ uv_vj_gini ] .",
    "the rest - frame colors uncertainties were calculated using the input photometry through monte carlo simulations . for each galaxy",
    ", we created mock seds using a gaussian distribution and calculated their rest - frame @xmath142 colors .",
    "this procedure was repeated 1000 times to derive the uncertainties for their color estimation .",
    "the average 1@xmath45 error ellipse is shown in the lower left of figure  [ uv_vj_gini]a .",
    "quiescents and dsfgs in the sample can be well separated in the @xmath142 diagram ( figure  [ uv_vj_gini]a ) , consistent with our classification based on the observed ir colors and morphological parameters .",
    "however , there are a few quiescents lying just across the dividing line which may be due to either photometric errors or that they suffering extinctions . while we can locate these galaxies in the quiescent region by pushing the dividing line to redder @xmath36 colors",
    ", many dsfgs will also enter the quiescent region .",
    "in fact , we verified that the observed @xmath92 $ ] colors for these outliers are also redder than other quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "interestingly , most of these outliers show edge - on disk morphologies in their f160w images , e.g. , i d 1127 , i d 2614 , and i d 6292 ( figure  [ h_fire_eg ] ) , indicating that they suffer more severe dust extinction .",
    "x - ray sources can also be separated in the @xmath142 diagram ( figure  [ uv_vj_gini]b ) : those x - ray sources with high @xmath116 are in the quiescent regions , despite that several of them are classified as dsfgs based on the ir colors .",
    "we argue that these x - ray sources with high @xmath116 may have significant bulges , yet their 24 @xmath46 mainly comes from agn .",
    "quiescents and dsfgs can not be separated in the color - mass diagram ( cmd ) as shown in figure  [ uv_lmass_eg ] and figure  [ uv_lmass_sf ] .",
    "we confine our analysis on their distribution in the cmd to the non - x - ray ieros in @xmath78 , where our sample is nearly complete for the most massive galaxies .",
    "the dashed red line is the red sequence criterion at z = 2 extrapolated from the same criterion at z < 1 in @xcite .",
    "both quiescents and dsfgs in this sample are massive and red . particularly , figure  [ uv_lmass_eg ] shows that the @xmath143 colors span a wide range for quiescents .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the distribution of spheroids and disks appears similar in the cmd .",
    "these quiescent disks contribute @xmath31 30% of the whole quiescent population in @xmath78 , confirming pervious findings @xcite .",
    "for the dsfgs , we find that disk galaxies tend to be more massive and have redder @xmath35 than the irr / mergers ( figure  [ uv_lmass_sf ] ) .",
    "in fact , as shown in table  [ tab : mor ] , 70% of the massive dsfgs are disks .",
    "these disks are very extended and do not show clear signatures of mergers / interactions from visual inspection .",
    "@xmath95 for most of these disks is smaller than that for irr / mergers ( figure  [ g_vs_m20 ] ) , suggesting that they are relatively undisturbed .",
    "these properties are incompatible with the expected compact or highly perturbed morphologies of ongoing mergers . instead , the stochastic accretion of gas may play a greater role in the formation of massive disks @xcite .",
    "with the new @xmath1 4 ms imaging and @xmath0/wfc3 f160w imaging from candels , we studied relationships between seds , morphologies , and star - formation status for a sample of 133 irac - selected extremely red objects ( ieros ) with @xmath16 > 3.25 $ ]  mag and @xmath42 < 21.5 $ ]  mag in the goods - s .",

    "such a classification produces very consistent results with that using @xmath116 and rest - frame colors ( @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 ) , which indicates that these quantities are closely related .",
