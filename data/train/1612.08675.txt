    "under propitious circumstances , quantum vacuum fluctuations produce macroscopically observable consequences . such is the case when a quantum field , and hence its fluctuations , satisfy non - trivial boundary conditions .",
    "one of the most celebrated physical realizations of this is the casimir force between two neutral bodies having non - trivial em response functions ( which , in some cases , behave as approximate realizations of idealized boundary conditions ) .",
    "this effect has been predicted and experimentally measured for several different geometries  @xcite .    qualitatively different effects , also due to the vacuum fluctuations , may arise when the bodies are set into motion or , more generally , when some external agent renders the boundary condition(s ) time - dependent .",
    "the resulting effect may involve dissipation and , when the boundary conditions experiment non - vanishing accelerations , _ real _ photons can be excited out of the quantum vacuum .",
    "this embodies the most frequently considered version of the so called dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) @xcite , also known as ` motion induced radiation ' .",
    "a more startling situation appears when a purely quantum , dissipative , frictional force arises between bodies moving with _ constant _ relative speed . here , the effect is due to the quantum degrees of freedom , living on the moving media , which are excited out of the vacuum , while the em field is nevertheless required as a mediator for those fluctuations . the resulting effect , termed _",
    "casimir friction _ has been extensively studied and some of the issues involved in its calculation have spurred some debate  @xcite .",
    "we recall that casimir friction predictions have been obtained mostly for dielectric materials . in this paper",
    ", we study the same effect , but for two graphene sheets .",
    "we argue that graphene has unusual properties which render its theoretical study more interesting . indeed , because of graphene s low dimensionality and particular crystalline structure , its low - energy excitations behave as massless dirac fermions ( with the fermi velocity @xmath0 playing the role of light s speed ) .",
    "this yields an unusual semi - metallic behavior  @xcite , as well as peculiar transport and optical properties  @xcite .    in natural units ( which we adopt here )",
    "the mass dimensions of the response function of graphene in momentum space can only be given by the momentum itself .",
    "indeed , the only other ingredients : @xmath0 and the effective electric charge of the fermions , are dimensionless .",
    "and , when a sheet is moving at a constant speed @xmath1 , another dimensionless object , @xmath1 itself , enters into the game ( see below ) .",
    "thus the non - trivial dependence of the macroscopic , casimir friction observables , will exhibit the remarkable property of being a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the overall ( trivial ) dimensions of the respective magnitude being determined purely by geometry : size and distance between sheets , like in the static casimir effect between perfect mirrors .",
    "a somewhat related but different effect , also termed ` quantum friction ' , has been studied for graphene in ref .",
    "note , however , that in that work the system consists of a single static graphene sheet over an sio 2 substrate .",
    "the frictional force acts , in this case , on graphene s charge carriers , which are assumed to have a constant drift velocity @xmath1 with respect to the substrate .    in our study",
    "below , we start from a consideration of the microscopic model for two graphene sheets coupled to the em field . those microscopic degrees of freedom correspond to dirac fields in @xmath2 dimensions which , in a functional integral formulation , are integrated out . that integration , plus the free gauge field action ,",
    "produces an in - out effective action for the latter . integrating the gauge field",
    ", we finally get an effective action for the full system , the imaginary part of which accounts for the dissipative effects in the system , a procedure we have followed in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "we perform our calculations within a functional integral formalism  @xcite , and after evaluating the probability of vacuum decay , we relate the imaginary part of the in - out effective action to the frictional force on the plates , and plot the latter as a function of the velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : themodel ] , we introduce the microscopic model considered in this article .",
    "then we derive an ` effective action ' for the em field , namely , an euclidean action which , in our description , is a functional of @xmath3 , the gauge field corresponding to the vacuum em field . in order to achieve",
    "that , we need to find the form of the vacuum polarization tensor for moving graphene ( as seen from rest ) assuming relativistic effects can be neglected .    in section  [ sec : effective ] , we calculate the full effective action resulting from the integration of the em field . that effective action , when rotated to minkowski space , is applied to the calculation of the probability of vacuum decay , as a function of the velocity of the sliding graphene sheet . in section  [ sec : potencia ] , we relate the imaginary part of the in - out effective action to the dissipated power , and thereby to the frictional force on the moving plate .",
    "section  [ sec : conclu ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we first introduce the euclidean action @xmath4 , for the em field plus the two graphene sheets , one of them static , the other moving at a constant velocity ( which is assumed to be parallel to the sheets ) .",
    "the action depends on the gauge field and on the dirac fields , the latter confined to the mirrors .",

    "there , it can be seen that the system undergoes three different regimes regarding dissipation . for @xmath171 , as already mentioned , there are no dissipative effects on the system , and the total frictional force vanishes . for velocities @xmath204 ,",
    "a frictional force appears , but it grows comparatively slow with the velocity . for @xmath205 , however , the frictional force starts growing rapidly when the velocity increases .",
    "the existence of a threshold may be justified as follows .",
    "let us consider the momentum and energy balance in a small time interval @xmath206 , assuming that both the frictional force and the dissipated energy are driven by pair creation .",
    "the only relevant component of the total momentum @xmath207 of the pair for the ( momentum ) balance is the one along the direction of the velocity @xmath1 . relating that component of @xmath207 to the frictional force",
    ", we see that : @xmath208 on the other hand , the energy balance reads @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the energy of the pair .",
    "but , since the fermions are both on - shell , we have @xmath211 ( the equal sign corresponds to a pair with momentum along the direction of @xmath1 ) . dividing eq.([eq : bener ] ) and eq.([eq : bmom ] ) , and taking into account eq.([eq : disper ] )",
    ", we see that a necessary condition for friction to happen is : @xmath212",
    "in this paper we computed the vacuum friction between graphene sheets subjected to a sidewise motion with constant relative velocity .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath2 dirac fields in the graphene sheets and the electromagnetic field has been taken into account using the known results for the comoving vacuum polarization tensor , properly transformed to the laboratory system in the case of the moving sheet .",
    "we have seen that this interaction generates an imaginary part in the effective action , that in the nonrelativistic limit can be interpreted as due to the excitation of the internal degrees of freedom produced by the relative motion between sheets .",
    "therefore , dissipation effect arises due to the fact the dirac vacuum becomes unstable against the production of a real ( i.e. , on shell ) fermion pair .",
    "we also computed the frictional force between plates using a slight modification of the calculation of the imaginary part of the effective action .",
    "the results for the imaginary part of the effective action and for the frictional force show an interesting phenomenon : there is a threshold for quantum friction effects , that is , there is no quantum friction when the relative velocity between sheets is smaller than the fermi velocity .",
    "we have presented a simple argument that justifies the existence of this threshold .",
    "the frictional force computed in this paper is much smaller than the usual casimir force between graphene sheets , which in turn is smaller than the casimir force between perfect conductors ( at least when considering gapped graphene , see ref .",
    "however , one may envisage situations in which the frictional force could be more relevant .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out that , at high temperatures , the casimir force between a graphene sheet and a perfect conductor becomes comparable with that between perfect conductors @xcite . moreover , doping can strongly enhance the casimir force between graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to generalize the results of the present paper to compute the frictional force in those situations , and discuss whether the enhancement of the casimir force have a corresponding effect in the frictional force or not .",
    "this work was supported by anpcyt , conicet , uba and uncuyo .",
    "m.b.f would like to thank toms s. bortoln for valuable insights and discussions .",
    "in absence of dissipative effects ( i.e. , for @xmath147 ) , the euclidean vacuum persistence amplitude is @xmath213 where @xmath130 is the elapsed time , and @xmath214 is the zero - point energy of the em field .",
    "this means that the casimir energy per unit of area @xmath215 can be obtained from the euclidean effective action of the plates when their relative velocity vanishes , that is @xmath216 .",
    "taking @xmath147 in eq . , and recalling the definitions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 of eq .",
    ", the transversal contribution to the zero - point energy results @xmath217 analogously , the longitudinal contribution is given by @xmath218    considering that typical fermi velocities are much smaller than the velocity of light , the leading contribution to the static casimir energy between two graphene sheets comes from the longitudinal effective action and reads @xmath219therefore the casimir attractive force acting on the sheets results @xmath220",
    "in order to obtain a final expression for the imaginary part of the effective action , it is necessary to compute the desired residues .",
    "we will repeat the proceadure we did in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the longitudinal part : @xmath221 where in the last factor we have explicitly used the fact that the denominator is positive - definite and thus the limit @xmath186 can be taken with no further harm .",
    "it could be shown that @xmath222 is definite - negative in all the integration region ( that is , for @xmath223 ) .",
    "this can be easily seen when explicitly taking both @xmath1 and @xmath224 , but the relation still holds for arbitrary values of @xmath225 .",
    "this means that we can set @xmath226 everywhere except in the second factor of , that can be written as : @xmath227 with @xmath228 now we can explicitly take the limit @xmath186 , @xmath229    therefore , the longitudinal contribution to the imaginary part of the effective action reads @xmath230 note that we have is a 4-dimensional integration of a function multiplied by the dirac - delta function composed with @xmath231 : @xmath232 where in our case @xmath233 .",
    "the second hand is an integration over the 3-dimensional surface defined by @xmath234",
    ". we can think this surface as the one defined by the equations @xmath235 and @xmath236 , with @xmath237 where @xmath238+k_3 ^ 2 \\left[1 + v_f^2 \\left(v^2 \\left(v_f^2 + 1\\right)-3\\right)\\right]\\right\\rbrace \\nonumber \\\\",
