    "[ [ section ] ]    the author would like to warn the reader that this paper is a draft preliminary version ; the proofs of some statements in section 5 are just sketched or even omitted .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    let @xmath1 be an associative algebra over a ground field @xmath9 of characteristic 0 , and denote by @xmath12 its hochschild cohomology .",
    "it is known that the graded space @xmath12 is a 2-algebra , that is it has a commutative product of degree 0 , a lie bracket of degree -1 , which are compatible as @xmath13=[a , b]\\cdot c \\pm b\\cdot [ a , c]\\ ] ] where the sign @xmath14 in is such that the bracket is _ odd _ , that is for homogeneous @xmath15 the sign @xmath16 .",
    "these two structures exist also on the hochschild complex of @xmath1 , where the product is the cup - product of cochains , and the bracket is the gerstenhaber bracket .",
    "however , on the level of cochains the equation fails .",
    "both the cup - product and the gerstenhaber bracket are quite artificial constructions .",
    "the cohomology @xmath12 is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the abelian category of @xmath1-bimodules , and @xmath1 is the tautological @xmath1-bimodule .",
    "it is well - known that the product in is the yoneda product in the definition .    here",
    "the following two questions arise : 1 ) why the yoneda product is ( graded ) commutative ( for a general abelian category it is not ) , and 2 ) how to define the bracket from the definition ?",
    "the answer for the both questions uses the fact that @xmath18 is a monoidal category , and @xmath1 is the unit object in it .",
    "the monoidal structure is the tensor product over @xmath1 , @xmath19 .",
    "there is a general theorem which roughly says : given a monoidal category @xmath4 and a unit object @xmath1 in it , @xmath20 is a 2-algebra .",
    "( more precisely , there is a condition ( * ) on @xmath4 formulated later , which is required for this theorem ) .",
    "this principle was known to many people , although the author does not know whether any written proof existed before .",
    "here we prove this general theorem among other things .",
    "as an example for the general theory , let us prove here that for the unit object @xmath1 in a monoidal category @xmath4 ( not necessarily abelian ) , the monoid @xmath21 is _ commutative_.    for denote the monoidal bifunctor by @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the unit object , and let @xmath23",
    ". then @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "but the right - hand sides of the both expressions are equal to @xmath26 , therefore , the left - hand sides are equal .",
    "we proved that @xmath27 .",
    "our proof that the algebra @xmath20 is graded - commutative ( in the case when @xmath4 is a monoidal abelian category ) can be considered as a generalization of the above proof , see section 2.1 .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    another question on hochschild cohomology we address here is the following .",
    "suppose the algebra @xmath1 is defined over @xmath8 , and is flat (= torsion free ) over @xmath8 .",
    "what is the operad acting in this case on @xmath12 ?    recall that the operad of 2-algebras can be defined as the homology operad of the little discs operad @xmath28 .",
    "that is , for the operad @xmath29 governing the 2-algebras , one has : @xmath30    we prove here the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath1 be an algebra over @xmath8 flat over @xmath8 .",
    "there is a natural action of the operad @xmath31 on @xmath12 , where @xmath32    here @xmath33 stands for the stable homotopy groups , @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the suspension operator , and the limit is attained for any finite cw complex @xmath36 by the freudenthal theorem ) .",
    "the case when @xmath1 is defined over a field of characteristic 0 is obtained from this more general case of @xmath8-algebra @xmath1 by the following well - known theorem ( see , e.g. [ a ] , part iii , lecture 4 ) : for any cw complex @xmath36 one has a canonical ( hurewicz ) isomorphism @xmath37 thus , we recover the 2-algebra operad .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    another subject of this paper , which originally motivated the overall project , is a proof of following conjecture due to maxim kontsevich : for any associative bialgebra @xmath1 its gerstenhaber - schack cohomology @xmath38 is a 3-algebra .",
    "the latter means that the graded space @xmath38 admits a graded commutative product of degree 0 , a lie bracket of degree -2 such that @xmath39=[a , b]\\cdot c \\pm b\\cdot [ a , c]\\ ] ] where the bracket is _ even _ , that is , for homogeneous @xmath15 , the sign @xmath40 .",
    "the author tried to use the construction of stefan schwede [ sch ] , which uses the monoidal structure on the category of bimodules over an algebra @xmath1 in the case of hochschild cohomology .",
    "there is a result of r.taillefer [ tai1,2 ] stating that for any bialgebra @xmath1 @xmath41 where @xmath0 is the category of _ tetramodules _ over @xmath1 , an abelian category associated to @xmath1 which is parallel to the category of bimodules in the case when @xmath1 is algebra .",
    "we construct on the category of tetramodules _ two _ monoidal structures @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are compatible in some rather complicated way .",
    "these compatibilities altogether give a 2-fold monoidal structure in the sense of [ bfsv ] on @xmath0 .",
    "there is a concept of @xmath3-fold monoidal category , introduced in loc.cit . ; it is a main technical tool of this paper .",
    "it is a category with @xmath3 _ ordered _ monoidal structures with some compatibilities .",
    "there is an operad of categories acting on any @xmath3-fold monoidal category ; the classifying spaces operad of this operad is homotopy equivalent to the @xmath3-dimensional little discs operad ( this fact is proven in [ bfsv ] ) .",
    "we use the last fact to prove the following general theorem .",
    "let @xmath4 be an abelian @xmath3-fold monoidal category satisfying some mild condition ( * ) , see section 2.1 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an object which is unit object for all @xmath3 monoidal structures . then @xmath44 is naturally an @xmath7-algebra whose commutative product is the yoneda product .",
    "when @xmath1 is a hopf algebra ( that is , a bialgebra with an antipode ) , the category of tetramodules obeys the condition ( * ) . as an immediate corollary",
    ", one has    let @xmath1 be a hopf algebra .",
    "then there is a natural 3-algebra structure on the gerstenhaber - schack cohomology @xmath38 .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    the paper is organized as follows :    in section 1 we recall the theory of vladimir retakh [ r],[nr ] of homotopy groups of the categories of extensions .",
    "the schwede s construction [ sch ] is based on the retakh s theory , as well as all our generalizations of it .",
    "we give a rather detailed exposition with complete proofs , basically because the original note [ r ] is too coincise , and [ nr ] works with a great generality of the waldhausen categories ;    in section 2 we recall the mentioned above construction of stefan schwede .",
    "this construction gives a lie bracket on @xmath12 in the intrinsic terms of the monoidal abelian category of @xmath1-bimodules .",
    "we discuss here the schwede s tensor product @xmath45 , the main ingredient of the construction , and give , following [ sch ] , an intrinsic construction of the gerstenhaber bracket on the hochschild cohomology ;    section 3 introduces @xmath3-fold monoidal categories .",
    "the main new result here is that the category of extensions @xmath46 in an @xmath3-fold monoidal abelian category @xmath4 with common unit object @xmath1 , is naturally an @xmath7-fold monoidal category ;    section 4 contains our results on the category @xmath0 of tetramodules over a bialgebra @xmath1 .",
    "we construct a 2-fold monoidal category structure on @xmath0 . the structure maps @xmath47 in this category",
    "are _ not _ isomorphisms . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "it is the first example of @xmath3-monoidal categories with the unit object for @xmath48 with this property . in particular",
    ", our 2-fold monoidal structure is not defined as a braided category .",
    "as well , we discuss the condition ( * ) .",
    "it turns out that this condition holds automatically when our bialgebra is a hopf algebra ( that is , admits an antipode ) . in the case of hopf algebras",
    "we give here a construction of lie bracket of degree -2 on the gerstenhaber - schack cohomology .    in section 5",
    "we deal with spectra .",
    "all main results of the paper , in particular theorems 0.1 and 0.2 above , are proven here .",
    "the main technical point here is to pass from a  spectrum \" of categories with an action of operad of categories to a spectrum of topological spaces , preserving the action of the corresponding operad .",
    "a technical point appears : if we do it naively , the operad action does not admit the `` base points '' .",
    "the main effort in this section is directed to introduce somehow the base points , preserving in the same time the homotopical type and the operad action .",
    "the basepoints are crucial when we use the smash - product in spectra , which was our initial way to think about the problem .",
    "the author tried many ways ; finitely , he became successful with a construction imitating the free loop space .",
    "we do not achieve basepoints in a proper sense , but we replace them by `` based subcategories '' . here",
    "we are very brief sometimes .",
    "we hope to improve the exposition in the sequel version .",
    "section 6 is served as an appendix . here",
    "we expose the theory of rachel taillefer , claiming that @xmath49 .",
    "this result is used throughout in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "our exposition is very closed to the original exposition in [ ta1,2 ] , but the presentation is a bit different . in particular , it is based on a concept of a @xmath50-pair in an abelian category . as a new result , we give a proof of the well - known folklore statement about the gerstenhaber - schack cohomology of the free commutative cocommutative bialgebra @xmath51 .",
    "i am very indebted to stefan schwede for many discussions and explanations .",
    "discussions with dima kaledin and bernhard keller were very useful for me .",
    "i am thankful to alexey gorinov , alexey davydov , pavel etingof , yal fregier , tom leinster , grisha merzon , vladimir retakh , dima tamarkin , vadik vologodsky for discussions and references .",
    "i am especially thankful to amnon neeman for many explanations on the work [ nr ] .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the conference `` quantization and geometry '' in zrich giovanni felder and carlo rossi for the invitation and for their hospitality .",
    "the work was partially supported by the research grant r1f105l15 of the university of luxembourg .",

    "divide the long exact sequence into short exact sequences and take the composition of the maps above .",
    "thus , we have a map @xmath62 .",
    "the natural question is : when two different extensions define the same elements in @xmath63 ?",

    "this set is an abelian group , as follows .",
    "the baer sum of extensions ( see [ m ] , ch.3 ) gives a functor @xmath75 which gives a map of simplicial sets @xmath76 .",
    "this gives the map of classifying spaces @xmath77 because the finite limits commute with the geometric realization functor ( see [ may ] ) .",
    "finally , we get a map @xmath78 .",
    "the fact that the baer sum becomes the usual sum in @xmath63 is proven in [ m ] , ch.3 .",
    "retakh [ r ] computed the higher homotopy groups of the space @xmath79 .",

    "are direct products of the eilenberg - maclane spaces .",
    "note here that there is a paper of alan robinson [ rob1 ] , which appeared 5 years before the retakh s paper , and where an analogous theorem for tor groups was proven .",
    "we would like to mention subsequent papers of robinson , especially the one on the extraordinary derived category [ rob2 ] .",
    "probably robinson was the first who tried to deal with `` modules and algebras in spectra '' in 80 s , while the category of symmetric spectra appeared in 90 s .",
    "we overview the main ideas of the proof in section 1.3 .",
    "let us mention an immediate corollary of the theorem above .",
