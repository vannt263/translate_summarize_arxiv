    "they appear to host numerous planetary systems @xcite and are prioritized in planned exoplanet surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the characterization of the resulting planets and whether they are in the habitable zone @xcite could be clouded by lack of efficient and precise stellar characterization .",

    "numerous techniques have been developed to circumvent this difficulty , by relating m dwarf parameters to easily - measured photometry or moderate - resolution spectroscopic features .",

    "this approximately halves the intrinsic @xmath76  mag scatter in @xmath1from nir spt ( figure [ fig : features ] ) .",
    "we explored alternative definitions of the features @xcite , and the quality of the resulting fits differs negligibly from that reported here .",
    "this model directly reveals that @xmath63is sensitive to small changes in @xmath1 at a given nir spt .",
    "this is primarily due to the strong sensitivity of this feature to surface gravity at low @xmath6 , a behavior that has been thoroughly explored in the context of youth indicators for low - mass stars @xcite . with the inclusion of [ fe / h ] in our model",
    ", we disentangle the gravity and [ fe / h ] sensitivity of the feature , which goes from being a binary indicator of youth or low gravity to having a much finer sensitivity to luminosity and surface gravity .",
    "thus , this feature is a precise and easily - measured gravity indicator for m dwarfs , a stellar regime in which established precision gravity measurement techniques ( e.g.  flicker , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not yet applicable .    our interpretation that the @xmath68-@xmath69-[fe / h ] relationship results from the gravity - sensitivity of @xmath63depends on the observed insensitivity to gravity of our [ fe / h ] measurements .",
    "although the @xcite [ fe / h ] calibrations employ gravity - sensitive features , we note that the @xmath68-@xmath69-[fe / h ] relationship is present ( with similar coefficients ) with different indicators of [ fe / h ] ( e.g.  the individual @xmath77 and @xmath78-band calibrations ) , which are based on different features with varied behaviors with gravity .",
    "we also find this relationship using [ fe / h ] derived from higher - mass companions , which are available for 21 of our stars from @xcite , and which are immune to effects within the m dwarf spectrum .",
    "we conclude that gravity - related systematic errors in our [ fe / h ] measurements are insignificant .",
    "we considered that our nir spt measurements could similarly have systematic errors that impact our interpretation of the @xmath68-@xmath69-[fe / h ] relationship .",
    "we note that our nir spts are based on the h@xmath14o - k2 index , which is known to correlate with @xmath6to @xmath79k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , the @xmath68-@xmath69-[fe / h ] relationship extends over @xmath80  mag in @xmath68 , which would equate to many hundreds of degrees in @xmath6 .",
    "we conclude that , within their stated errors , our [ fe / h ] and @xmath6indicators are accurately accounting for their contribution to the behavior of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the well - established gravity - sensitivity of @xmath63is the most reasonable explanation for its correlation with @xmath68 .",
    "this model efficiently provides @xmath1 for m dwarfs without parallaxes , thereby enabling `` spectroscopic distance '' and fundamental parameter measurements of m dwarfs . as an illustration",

    "this is in excellent agreement with the @xmath82 measured in @xcite , which is based on six high - resolution spectra of this star and library of more than 100 similar high - s / n spectra . through the tight relations between @xmath1 and stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radius , the model we present can help to provide determinations of m dwarf parameters and the location of the habitable zone for m dwarf exoplanet hosts .",
    "compared with existing techniques for measuring these parameters @xcite , our technique benefits from a large set of calibrators , and requires only a single , non - flux calibrated , moderate - resolution nir spectrum .      after establishing that the feature , [ fe / h ] , and nir spt can be used to determine m dwarf @xmath1 , we explored extending the technique to measuring m dwarf radius , using 18 nearby m dwarfs with interferometrically measured radii ( figure  [ fig : radlum]c ) .",
    "we interpolated the dartmouth stellar evolution program ( dsep , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) models at the [ fe / h ] and @xmath1 of each star to predict radius , using both the parallax - based @xmath1 and the spectroscopic @xmath1 indicated by the techniques in section [ sec : mk ] .",
    "we compared these radii with the interferometric radii @xcite .",
    "we note that the mean error in the interferometrically measured radii themselves is approximately @xmath83 .",
    "we found that we could derive radius to @xmath84% when using the parallax - based @xmath1 , and to @xmath85% with just the information available from the nir spectra .",
    "we find no evidence for a @xmath86 systematic offset between @xmath1-based model - predicted and measured m dwarf radii in these 18 stars , in contrast to interpolations at l@xmath87 and @xmath6(e.g .",

    "radius is therefore an accurate , precise , and efficient method that can be applied to m dwarfs well beyond the reach of current interferometric facilities .",
    "the @xmath3-elements , such as silicon and titanium , can be formed in type ii supernovae , and they are more abundant (  enriched \" ) relative to iron in older stellar populations . to explore the sensitivity of the and features to @xmath3-enrichment , we first considered a subset of 23 m dwarfs from our sample with @xmath3-enrichment ( [ ti / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ) measurements in the literature from either direct spectroscopy @xcite or based on spectroscopy of higher - mass companions @xcite .",
    "we found that ( figure  [ fig : alpha ]  a , b ) @xmath3-enriched stars have higher ( stronger absorption ) @xmath70and lower ( weaker absorption ) @xmath69 , as expected since calcium is an @xmath3-element and sodium is not .",
    "moreover , for the subset of our m dwarfs where measurements are available , high @xmath70and low @xmath69are also consistent with kinematic and color - based indicators of old age . a toomre diagram ( figure  [ fig : alpha ]  c ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which shows stellar galactocentric vertical ( @xmath88 ) , radial ( @xmath89 ) , and rotational ( @xmath90 ) kinetic energies , can dynamically separate older and younger stars : older stars have a wide distribution of kinetic energies , while younger stars have lower kinetic energies .",
    "the lower metallicities of older stars also separate these stars well in the ( @xmath91 ) color - color plane ( figure  [ fig : alpha ]  d ) , due to h@xmath92 continuum and h@xmath14o opacity effects @xcite .",
    "these observational indications of abundance and age suggest that the and features jointly indicate @xmath3-enrichment in m dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : cana ] shows the plane defined by @xmath69and @xmath70 .",
    "we note that , for the lowest @xmath69values , targets with low and high h@xmath3 are generally well - separated by @xmath70(with the exception of cm dra , an active close binary system ) .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of @xmath70being dominated by chromospheric activity , which is supported by our observation of in emission and the findings of @xcite .",
    "we also note that cm dra , a system that is suspected of @xmath3-enrichment @xcite , stands out in this plane , as does the binary system gj 725 . in both systems , models with [ @xmath3/fe]=0.2 provide a better match to observations than models with [ @xmath3/fe]=0.0 ( e.g. figure [ fig : radlum ] ) .",
    "we posit a simple interpretation of these features : stars with low @xmath69are likely either low - gravity or @xmath3-enriched , and the activity - sensitivity of @xmath70can differentiate between these younger ( more active ) or older ( less active ) populations . as we only probe a limited range of [ @xmath3/fe ] and [ fe / h ] ,",
    "this interpretation is not conclusive , but is strongly suggestive and provides a promising direction for further exploration and the development of better techniques for measuring m dwarf compositions .",
    "the and spectroscopic indicators provide a wealth of new and easily obtained information about m dwarf stellar properties .",
    "the broad applicability of these physically - motivated indicators and associated techniques in mid- to late - type m dwarfs , their possible constraints on @xmath3-enrichment , and their simplicity offer a substantial improvement over existing methods for measuring m dwarf parameters .",
    "these indicators and techniques will be useful for appraising m dwarf planetary systems discovered in the coming years ( by e.g.  by _ tess _ and _ k2 _ ) , and for prioritizing nearby m dwarf exoplanet systems for planetary atmospheric characterization with _ jwst_. by providing stellar mass , luminosity , and radius through @xmath1 , they will provide a necessary foothold for measuring planetary parameters and the location of the habitable zone .",
    "they also provide a path toward more precise distances to galactic m dwarfs , for which the current limiting factor is the scatter in the color - luminosity relations used to estimate distance ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey bandpass contains the and @xmath2-band features , as well as indicators of metallicity and @xmath6@xcite , potentially enabling archival analysis with the and indicators .",
    "finally , we note that the feature will be observed by the _ gaia _",
    "rv spectrometer and may provide leverage for the measurement of @xmath3-enrichment and activity levels in the large sample of m dwarfs observed by _ gaia_.",
    "the measurement of the features described here is relatively observationally inexpensive : a single @xmath10 nir spectrum is sufficient , and is substantially easier to obtain than the parallax measurements , high - resolution spectra , or broadband flux - calibrated spectra required by other techniques .",
