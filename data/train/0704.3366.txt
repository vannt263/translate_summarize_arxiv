    "the advent of ultracold , strongly interacting fermi gases @xcite , molecular bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and fermionic condensates @xcite has opened up unique possibilities to study the fundamental physics of interacting fermions . the availability of controllable model systems with tunable interactions provides unprecedented experimental access to the many - body physics of fermionic quantum systems , which is of great fundamental importance for various branches of physics @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem , which has been discussed in the theoretical literature for decades @xcite , is the crossover from bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) to a macroscopic quantum state in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) regime . in this crossover , the nature of pairing changes from the formation of bosonic molecules by fermionic atoms to pairing supported by many - body effects . with novel model systems now available in ultracold fermi gases ,",
    "the bec - bcs crossover has recently stimulated a great deal of interest in both theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "collective excitation modes in trapped ultracold fermi gases provide powerful tools to investigate the macroscopic properties of a system in the bec - bcs crossover @xcite . for experiments of this class ,",
    "ultracold @xmath1li gases have excellent properties .",
    "this is because of their stability in the molecular regime @xcite and precise magnetic tunability of interactions based on a broad feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "early experiments on collective modes in the bec - bcs crossover provided evidence for superfluidity @xcite and showed a striking transition from hydrodynamic to collisionless behavior @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments yielded a precision test of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "the previous experiments have focussed on collective modes with compression character , where both the hydrodynamic properties and the equation of state determine the mode frequency @xcite .    in this article , we report on measurements of a _ pure surface mode _ in the bec - bcs crossover , which provides new insight into the dynamics of the system .",
    "the `` radial quadrupole mode '' in an elongated trap , the fundamentals of which are discussed in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , allows for a test of hydrodynamic behavior without being influenced by changes in the equation of state . in sec .",
    "[ experimental procedure ] , we present our experimental setup and the main procedures . we introduce a tool to excite collective oscillations with an acousto - optic scanning system .",
    "the results of our measurements , presented in sec .  [ results ] , provide us with new insight on the abrupt transition from hydrodynamic to collisionless behavior , first observed in @xcite .",
    "the present work provides strong evidence that quasi - static hydrodynamic theory @xcite does not apply to collective modes of a strongly interacting fermionic superfluid , when the oscillation frequencies approach the pairing gap @xcite .",
    "the confining potential in our experiments is close to the limit of an elongated harmonic trap with cylindrical symmetry . in this case",
    ", we can consider purely radial collective oscillations , neglecting the axial motion .",
    "the frequencies of the radial modes can be expressed in units of the radial trap frequency @xmath2 .",
    "we note that our experiments are performed in a three - dimensional regime , where the energy @xmath3 is typically a factor of 30 below the chemical potential and finite - size effects can be neglected .",
    "in this situation , there are two elementary collective modes of the system , the radial compression mode and the radial quadrupole mode @xcite .",
    "we focus on the quadrupole mode , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ surface_mode_overview ] .",
    "this mode corresponds to an oscillating radial deformation , which can be interpreted as a standing surface wave .",
    "the mode was first demonstrated in atomic bec experiments @xcite and applied to investigate rotating systems @xcite , but so far it has not been studied in strongly interacting fermi gases .",
    "+    being a pure surface mode , the frequency @xmath4 of the radial quadrupole mode does not depend on the compressibility of the system .",
    "the frequency @xmath4 does not depend on the equation of state but on the collisional properties . in the hydrodynamic regime ,",
    "whether the gas is a superfluid or a classical gas with a collision rate strongly exceeding the radial trap frequency , the frequency of this mode is given by @xcite @xmath5 in contrast , for a collisionless gas , where the atoms freely oscillate in the trap , the frequency is @xmath6    because @xmath4 is insensitive to the compressibility of the gas and the difference between the collisonless and the hydrodynamic frequencies is large , the radial quadrupole mode can serve as an excellent tool to probe pure hydrodynamics .",
    "particularly interesting is the transition from hydrodynamic to collisionless behavior at lowest temperatures .",
    "such a change occurs in a strongly interacting fermi gas on the bcs side of the resonance @xcite . near this transition ,",
    "measurements on the compression mode indicated frequency down shifts , which raised questions concerning the validity of standard hydrodynamic theory in this interaction regime @xcite .",
    "previous experiments could not unambiguously identify the origin of frequency shifts near the hydrodynamic - to - collisionless transition , which is a particular motivation for probing the crossover gas with the radial quadrupole mode .",
    "the apparatus and the basic preparation methods for experiments with a strongly interacting fermi gas of @xmath0li atoms have been described in our previous work @xcite . as a starting point",
    ", we produce a molecular bec of @xmath0li@xmath7 @xcite . by changing an external magnetic field",
    ", we can control the inter - particle interactions in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance , which is centered at @xmath8 g @xcite .",
    "the interactions are characterized by the atomic s - wave scattering length @xmath9 .",
    "we start our experiments with an ensemble of about @xmath10 atoms in an almost pure bec at a magnetic field of @xmath11 g . in order to change the properties of the system adiabatically , we slowly ramp to the final magnetic field , where the measurements are performed @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the gas is typically below 0.1 @xmath12 , unless stated otherwise .    in order to observe the collective oscillations , we take absorption images of the cloud in the x - y - plane after release from the trap .",
    "we illuminate the atoms with a probe beam along the z - direction of the cigar - shaped cloud .",
    "the probe light causes a resonant excitation of the d2-line , at a wavelength of 671 nm .",
    "we use dichroic mirrors for combining and separating the probe and the dipole trapping beam .",
    "the frequency of the probe beam can be tuned over a range of more than 1ghz , which enables resonant imaging over the whole range of magnetic fields that we create in our experiments .",
    "the gas is confined in a nearly harmonic trapping potential , which has an axially symmetric , cigar - shaped trap geometry . optical confinement in the radial direction",
    "is created by a focused 1030-nm near - infrared laser beam with a waist of @xmath13 m .",
    "the potential in the axial direction consists of a combination of optical and magnetic confinement @xcite ; the magnetic confinement is dominant under the conditions of the present experiments .",
    "we set the laser power to 270 mw , which results in a radial trap frequency of @xmath14hz and an axial trap frequency of @xmath15hz at a magnetic field of @xmath11 g .",
    "the trap frequencies correspond to a fermi energy of a noninteracting cloud @xmath16nk .    in order to excite collective oscillations",
    ", we suddenly change the optical trapping potential .",
    "the position and shape of our trapping potential in the x - y - plane can be manipulated through the use of a two - dimensional scanning system .",
    "one feature of the system is that we can rapidly displace the trap laterally .",
    "fast modulation of the beam position enables us to create time - averaged potentials @xcite .",
    "+    the scanning system is constructed by use of two acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) , which are aligned for vertical and horizontal deflections .",
    "fig.[scanning_system_detail ] illustrates the principle of our scanning system for one direction .",
    "a collimated beam passes through an aom and is deflected depending on the driving frequency .",
    "a lens is placed at a distance of one focal length behind the aom , so that the deflection results in a parallel displacement of the beam . by changing the driving frequency of the aom ,",
    "the lateral position of the focus is shifted .",
    "this system enables us to displace the focus of the trapping beam in the horizontal and the vertical direction by up to four times the beam waist in all directions .",
    "furthermore , the deflection can be modulated by frequencies of up to @xmath17mhz within 3db bandwidth . in our trap configuration ,",
    "we use modulation frequencies of @xmath18khz , which greatly exceeds the trap frequency .",
    "we create elliptic potentials , i.e. potentials with @xmath19 , by modulating the trap position along a specific direction .",
    "we use this for the excitation of the quadrupole mode . by choosing a suited modulation function @xcite",
    ", these elliptic potentials are nearly harmonic . +    when we excite the quadrupole mode , we first adiabatically deform the trapping potential in @xmath20ms to an elliptic shape .",
    "this slow deformation ensures that the cloud stays in thermal equilibrium even in the near - collisionless regime and no excitations occur .",
    "we suddenly switch off the deformation leading to an oscillation in the x - y - plane of the elliptic cloud in the originally round trap .",
    "the initial deformation corresponds to different trap frequencies in horizontal and vertical direction where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 determines the amplitude of the emerging oscillation ; we choose it for most of our measurements ( unless stated otherwise ) to be @xmath24 .",
    "we increase @xmath23 by increasing the modulation for the time averaged potential along the y - direction .",
    "as the modulation decreases the confinement strength of the dipole trap , we simultaneously ramp up the trap power to ensure that the mean trap frequency @xmath25 remains constant .",
    "this avoids excitation of the compression mode .",
    "fig.[surface_timing ] shows the timing scheme for the excitation of the radial quadrupole mode . at @xmath26 , the collective oscillation is excited and the cloud starts oscillating in the trap for a variable time @xmath27 .",
    "horizontal and vertical widths of the cloud , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , oscillate in the trap out of phase with a relative phase shift of @xmath30 .",
    "as an observable , we choose the difference in widths @xmath31 , which cancels out small effects of residual compression oscillations . for normalization , we introduce the width @xmath32 of the cloud in the trap without excitation .    experimentally , we determine the collective quadrupole oscillations after suddenly switching off the trap and a subsequent expansion time @xmath33 .",
    "we then take an absorption image of the cloud and determine its horizontal and vertical widths @xmath28 and @xmath34 via a two - dimensional thomas - fermi profile fit . from these measurements after expansion , we can determine the in - trap behavior .",
    "+    typical data sets of radial quadrupole oscillations are shown in fig.[surface_typical_oscillation ] .",
    "fig.[surface_typical_oscillation](a ) shows an oscillation in the hydrodynamic regime ; here we observe a weakly damped harmonic oscillation centered about a small constant offset .",
    "fig.[surface_typical_oscillation](b ) shows the typical behavior in the collisionless regime .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is clearly higher than in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "the oscillation shows stronger damping and has an exponentially time - varying offset .",
    "we find that , for both regimes , the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath27 can be well described by the fit function @xmath36 which is explained in detail in appendix [ appendix_thermalization ] .",
    "note that the frequency @xmath4 and the damping constant @xmath37 are independent of the expansion during @xmath33 and characterize the behavior of the trapped oscillating atom cloud .",
    "in contrast , the amplitude @xmath38 and the phase shift @xmath39 depend on the expansion time and provide further information on the dynamics of the gas .",
    "the offset function @xmath40 with amplitude @xmath41 and damping constant @xmath42 results from thermalization effects and is only relevant in the collisionless regime ( see discussion in appendix [ appendix_thermalization ] ) .",
    "the constant offset @xmath43 results from a slight inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , which gives rise to a weak saddle potential .",
    "this increases ( decreases ) the cloud size in y - direction ( x - direction ) during expansion .",
    "here we first discuss our measurements of the frequency @xmath44 and the damping rate @xmath37 of the in - trap oscillation ( sec.[freq_damp ] ) .",
    "we then present the data for the phase offset @xmath39 and the amplitude @xmath38 ( sec.[surface_subsection_phase_amp ] ) .",
    "finally , we explore the hydrodynamic - to - collisionless transition ( sec.[surface_temperature_dependence ] ) .",
    "as commonly used in the field of bec - bcs crossover physics @xcite , the dimensionless parameter @xmath45 is introduced to characterize the interaction regime .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is the fermi wave number and @xmath47 is the mass of an atom .",
    "+      in fig.[surface_freq_damping ] , we show the results for the frequency @xmath4 and the damping rate @xmath37 of the radial quadrupole mode throughout the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath37 are normalized to the trap frequency @xmath2 , which we determine by a sloshing mode measurement @xcite .",
    "we include small corrections resulting from anharmonicity of the trapping potential and the residual ellipticity of the trap ( see appendix [ appendix_corrections ] ) .",
    "the data confirm the expected transition between the hydrodynamic and the collisionless regime on the bcs side of the resonance ( see sec.[theory ] ) .",
    "the transition is qualitatively different from the hydrodynamic - to - collisionless crossover in a classical gas @xcite or in a fermi gas without superfluidity @xcite . instead of a continuous and monotonous variation of the frequency between the two limits ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , an abrupt change occurs .",
    "when this transition is approached from the hydrodynamic side , a striking frequency downshift shows up as a precursor of the transition to higher frequencies . in the transition region",
    "( shaded area in fig.[surface_freq_damping ] ) , no data points are shown because of the large damping and correspondingly very large uncertainties for the measured frequency .",
    "the damping rate shows similar behavior as in our previous measurements on the radial compression mode @xcite .",
    "maximum damping occurs near the hydrodynamic - to - collisionless transition , whereas minimum damping is observed slightly below the resonance . in general , we find that damping is roughly two times larger for the quadrupole mode than for the compression mode at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "the faster damping of the quadrupole mode is plausible in view of the larger frequency change at the transition .",
    "we now discuss the behavior in different regions in more detail :    in the unitarity limit , the normalized frequency agrees well with the theoretically expected value of @xmath50 for a hydrodynamic gas , see eq .  .",
    "to check for consistency with previous experiments @xcite , we here also reproduced the frequency @xmath51 of the radial compression mode on the @xmath52 accuracy level .",
    "the damping is low for the fermi gas in the unitarity limit .",
    "in contrast to the compression mode , the quadrupole mode frequency stays constant throughout the crossover , indicating that it is independent of the equation of state .    in the strongly interacting bec regime",
    ", there is an increase in the damping and a slight increase in the frequency for increasing @xmath45 . as the gas is more susceptible to heating by inelastic processes in the deep molecular regime @xcite",
    ", both effects may be due to a thermal component in this region .",
    "the frequency exhibits the pronounced `` jump '' from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless frequency .",
    "this transition is accompanied by a pronounced maximum of the damping rate .",
    "the frequency stays almost constant about 5% above the theoretically expected value of @xmath53 .",
    "interaction effects in the attractive fermi gas are likely to cause this significant upshift @xcite .",
    "as we can not experimentally realize a non - interacting fermi gas above the resonance , we could not perform further experimental checks .    in this regime , we detect a substantial down shift in the quadrupole mode frequency .",
    "the effect begins to show up already slightly above the resonance ( @xmath54 ) and increases to a magnitude of almost 20% ( @xmath55 at @xmath56 ) , before the transition to collisionless behavior occurs .",
    "indications of a similar down shift have been observed already in compression mode experiments @xcite , but here the down shift is considerably larger and not blurred by changes in the equation of state .    a plausible explanation for the curious behavior of the collective mode frequency on the bcs side of the resonance is provided by coupling of the oscillation to the pairing gap @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the abrupt transition is caused by pair breaking resulting from resonant coupling of the oscillation to the gap , then the down shift may be interpreted as a coupling effect when the gap is not much larger than the oscillation frequency @xcite .",
    "a similar shift may also arise from coupling of hydrodynamics and quasiparticle motion @xcite .",
    "the observed phenomenon still awaits a full theoretical interpretation .",
    "additional information on the interaction regime is provided by the phase shift @xmath39 and the amplitude @xmath38 of the observed oscillation ( see eq . ) .",
    "this is useful since extremely high damping in the transition region makes a meaningful determination of frequency and damping practically impossible .",
    "we find that both amplitude and phase shift , however , can be determined with reasonable uncertainties even in the transition regime .",
    "+    in the following , we present measurements of phase shift and amplitude .",
    "these are compared to model calculations , which are described in detail in appendix [ appendix_scaling ] .    in fig .",
    "[ surface_phase_amp ] , the phase @xmath39 and the relative amplitude are plotted versus the interaction parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the relative amplitude is given by the amplitude @xmath38 ( definition see eq . )",
    "divided by the average width of the cloud after expansion .",
    "the average width is obtained by averaging @xmath58 over one oscillation period using the same data set from which we extract @xmath38 .    in the transition area around @xmath59 ,",
    "the phase shift @xmath39 shows the step - like change at the transition from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless regime .",
    "this is similar to the jump in frequency in fig.[surface_freq_damping ] . in the collisionless and unitary regimes",
    ", the phase agrees with the theoretically expected values ( solid line and dotted line , respectively ) .    as a general trend ,",
    "the relative amplitude is larger in the hydrodynamic and smaller in the collisionless regime . in the hydrodynamic regime ,",
    "the relative amplitude decreases for decreasing @xmath45 , which is explained by the change of @xmath60 from 1 to 2/3 ; @xmath60 is the polytropic index of the equation of state ( see appendix[appendix_scaling ] ) . at unitarity",
    ", the relative amplitude agrees well with the numerically calculated value for @xmath61 ( dotted line ) . in the collisionless limit",
    ", the relative amplitude is half of the value at unitarity , which is also consistent with our calculations in app .",
    "[ appendix_amp_phase ] .",
    "we note that at the transition from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless regime , the value of the relative amplitude decreases even below the collisionless value .    in summary , the behavior of the phase shift and",
    "the amplitude agrees with our model presented in appendix [ appendix_scaling ] ( see also fig.[surface_expansion_amplitude ] and fig.[surface_expansion_measurements ] ) , in particular the prominent change in the phase offset is confirmed .",
    "the measurements presented in the preceding subsections were taken under fixed experimental conditions , where only the scattering length @xmath9 was varied . in this subsection",
    "we investigate how the transition from hydrodynamic to collisionless behavior depends on the experimental parameters excitation amplitude , trap depth and temperature .    in a first set of experiments",
    ", we explored whether the position of the transition depends on the excitation amplitude .",
    "we increase or decrease the amplitude by a factor of 2 .",
    "this allows us to compare the oscillations where the amplitude is @xmath62% , @xmath63% and @xmath64% of the averaged width .",
    "we do not observe any significant change in the position of the transition .    in general , we find that the transition always occurs when the mode frequency is similar to the pairing gap .",
    "this is supported by the fact that when we vary the trap depth the transition occurs at a constant scattering length ( @xmath65 , b @xmath66 g ) and does not depend on @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "a change in laser power of our trapping laser influences both fermi energy @xmath67 and the frequency @xmath4 .",
    "as we increase the trap power by a factor of 10 , we also increase the radial trap frequencies by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "this changes the fermi energy by a factor of 2.2 and the pairing gap , which scales like the trap frequencies , by roughly a factor of 3 @xcite .",
    "these findings suggest that the transition is linked to a coupling of the collective oscillation to the pairing gap .",
    "this is also in agreement with earlier results on the radial compression mode @xcite .",
    "+    to explore the temperature dependence of the transition between the hydrodynamic and the collisionless phase , we use a controlled heating scheme similar to the one described in @xcite , where we hold the gas in a recompressed trap and let it heat up .",
    "we set the magnetic field to 920 g ( @xmath69 ) , i.e. slightly below the hydrodynamic - to - collisionless transition , where the regime is still clearly hydrodynamic .",
    "we observe the oscillations in a gas at the lowest temperature we can achieve in our experiments ( filled circles ) and in a `` hotter '' gas ( open triangles ) in fig .",
    "[ surface_temperature ] .",
    "the temperature of the cold gas is @xmath70 and we believe the temperature of the heated gas to be @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ surface_temperature ] clearly shows that the frequency for the colder ensemble is lower than that of the heated one and the amplitude is lower by roughly a factor of 2 . using our model in appendix[appendix_scaling ]",
    "this indicates a temperature driven transfer of the ensemble from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless regime .",
    "thus we find that the radial quadrupole mode is suited to detect temperature induced changes of the collisional regime of the gas .",
    "an exploration of the phase diagram of our system depending on temperature is possible , but beyond the scope of this article . in our lab , work is currently in progress on the radial scissors mode , which turns out to be an even better tool for the exploration of temperature effects .",
    "we have presented measurements on the radial quadrupole mode of an ultracold @xmath0li fermi gas in the bec - bcs crossover . as a pure surface excitation ,",
    "this elementary mode probes hydrodynamic behavior without being affected by changes in the equation of state .",
    "we have measured the characteristic properties of this collective mode in a wide range of interaction strengths .",
    "our observations provide new insight into the dynamics of the gas , in particular on the bcs side of the crossover , where the character of the oscillations abruptly changes from hydrodynamic to collisionless behavior .",
    "our measurements presented in this paper show the phenomenon much clearer than in the radial compression mode @xcite and provide quantitative data on the behavior near the transition .",
    "in particular , the data show that a substantial down shift of the collective mode frequency occurs in the hydrodynamic regime as a precursor of the transition .",
    "the experimental results support the interpretation that the coupling of oscillation mode and pairing gap @xcite plays a crucial role for the collective excitation dynamics on the bcs side of the crossover .",

    "this confirms our approach presented above .",
    "here we describe thermalization effects in a near - collisionless gas that are not included in the model for the collisionless limit in app.[appendix_collisionless ] . despite the word `` collisionless ''",
    ", collisions play a crucial role for thermalization for our experimental parameters .",
    "a typical time scale for thermalization processes is only a few oscillation cycles long . by analyzing the theory ,",
    "we are able to introduce a universal fit function , as given by eq . , which describes the oscillation both in the hydrodynamic and in the near - collisionless regime .",
    "the measured behavior of the nearly collisionless quadrupole oscillation ( see fig.[surface_typical_oscillation ] ) has two characteristics : after excitation the oscillation is centered around @xmath115 , then after some time it is centered around @xmath106 .",
    "these two limits are consistent with thermalization of the gas on a relevant time scale greater than the period of the oscillation .    in order to model these effects ,",
    "we follow a theory based on a classical gas in the transition between the hydrodynamic and the collisionless behavior described in @xcite .",
    "an application of this theory for the compression mode in the hydrodynamic regime has been used in @xcite . here we will handle thermalization effects of the quadrupole mode in the near - collisionless regime .    using the classical boltzmann - vlasov kinetic equation in the relaxation - time approximation and ignoring mean field effects one can derive the following coupled differential equations @xcite @xmath116 and @xmath117 the parameter @xmath118 is the scaling function described earlier in appendix [ appendix_scaling ] ; @xmath119 is a scaling parameter directly related to the temperature and @xmath120 .",
    "the initial condition for @xmath119 is @xmath121 , as long as the gas is in thermal equilibrium at the moment of the excitation .",
    "the parameter @xmath122 is the relaxation time which describes the time scale of collisions . in the collisionless limit , when @xmath123 , the differential equations simplify to the simple form in eq .. for the hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath124 ) , we find eq .. +    the solutions to these equations depend on the parameter @xmath122 as can be seen in fig.[collisionless_oscillation_theory ] .",
    "our measured data in the collisionless regime are well described by @xmath125 ( compare to fig .",
    "[ surface_typical_oscillation ] ) .",
    "we find that the model calculations from and can be well described with the following fit function @xmath126 the first term describes the exponentially damped oscillations .",
    "the second term describes the shift of the center of the oscillation in the collisionless regime .",
    "the third term @xmath43 is a constant offset which will be discussed later .",
    "we have used eq . to fit our experimental measurements .",
    "we find that the free fit parameters @xmath42 and @xmath37 are related through @xmath127 for all our measurements in the near - collisionless regime . in the hydrodynamic regime @xmath128 , and",
    "therefore @xmath42 becomes irrelevant .",
    "the constant offset @xmath43 is due to an experimental artifact that results from a slight inhomogeneity of the magnetic field . at the location of the atoms the inhomogeneous magnetic field leads to a weak saddle potential which causes a slight anisotropic expansion during time of flight",
    "this anisotropy is responsible for a slight offset in @xmath35 .",
    "the theoretical normalized frequencies @xmath129 are calculated for perfectly harmonic trapping potentials in an idealized symmetric trap geometry .",
    "there are small derivations from this conditions in real experiments . in order to compare the experimental data to the idealized theoretical case",
    ", we have to correct our data .",
    "the measured normalized frequency @xmath130 of the radial quadrupole mode has to be increased because of two small corrections .",
    "the larger correction is based upon a slight anharmonicity of the trapping potential and the spatial extension of the cloud in the trap .",
    "the smaller correction is caused by a small residual ellipticity of the trapping potential .",
    "the potential created by our trapping beam has a gaussian shape .",
    "this results in a nearly harmonic potential in the center of the trap ; however , for higher precision one must take into account higher order terms of the potential .",
    "anharmonicity effects influence both our measurements of the sloshing mode frequency , where we determine @xmath2 , and our measurements of the quadrupole mode frequency @xmath4 .",
    "as we evaluate the normalized frequency @xmath131 , the anharmonicity effects on sloshing and quadrupole mode almost cancel out each other .",
    "the small remaining correction to the normalized frequency is included by multiplying with a prefactor @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the anharmonicity parameter @xmath133 relates the energy of the oscillation to the total potential depth and is defined by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the root - mean - square radius of the trapped cloud and @xmath136 is the potential depth .",
    "the parameter @xmath137 depends on the interaction regime . in the hydrodynamic regime , it is given by @xmath138 , whereas in the collisionless regime @xmath137 is determined by @xmath139 @xcite . here , @xmath60 is the polytropic index of the equation of state . in our experiments , typically @xmath140 , but @xmath141 can rise to an upper limit of @xmath142 .    in the hydrodynamic regime",
    ", there is also a correction due to residual ellipticity effects .",
    "this correction takes into account that we compare our measurements with a theory for non - elliptic geometries .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath143 of the trap is defined by @xmath144 . in our experiments ,",
    "the ellipticity is small and given by @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the ellipticity correction by multiplication of a prefactor @xmath146 @xcite , where the interaction dependent factor @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 .",
    "altogether , @xmath149 is smaller than 0.006 for all data points ."
