    "over the last two decades , the evidence of power laws in frequency - size distributions of several natural hazards such as earthquakes @xcite , volcanic eruptions @xcite , forest fires @xcite and landslides @xcite has suggested a relationship between these complex phenomena and self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "the idea of soc @xcite , applied to many media exhibiting avalanche dynamics @xcite , refers to the tendency of natural systems to self - organize into a critical state where the distribution of event sizes is represented by a power law with an exponent @xmath0 , which is universal in the sense that it is robust to minor changes in the system .",
    "generally , the nature of a _ critical _ state is evidenced by the fact that the size of a disturbance to the system is a poor predictor of the system response .",
    "let us consider storms as perturbations for natural slopes .",
    "large storms can produce large avalanches , but also small storms sometimes can do it . on the other hand , small storms",
    "usually do not produce any avalanche , but also large storms may not cause any avalanching phenomena .",
    "moreover , avalanches triggered by small storms can be larger than those triggered by large storms",
    ". the unpredictability of the sizes of such system responses to incremental perturbations and the observed power - law statistics could be the exhibition of self - organized critical behavior in most natural avalanches .",
    "however , the idea of understanding power - law distributions within the framework of soc is not the only one .",
    "recently , in order to reproduce the range of the power - law exponents observed for landslides , some authors have introduced a two - threshold cellular automaton , which relates landslide dynamics to the vicinity of a breakdown point rather than to self - organization @xcite .    in this paper , we report an accurate investigation of a cellular automaton model , which we have recently proposed to describe landslide events and , specifically , their frequency - size distributions @xcite . in particular , we discuss the role of a finite driving rate and the anisotropy effects in our non - conservative system .",
    "it has been pointed out by several authors that the driving rate is a parameter that has to be fine tuned to zero in order to observe criticality @xcite .",
    "we notice that the limit of zero driving rate is only attainable in an ideal chain reaction , therefore finite rates of external drives are essential ingredients in the analysis of the dynamics of real avalanche processes .",
    "we show that increasing the driving rate the frequency - size distribution of landslide events evolves continuously from a power - law ( small driving rates ) to an exponential ( gaussian ) function ( large driving rates ) .",
    "interestingly , a crossover regime characterized by a maximum of the distribution at small sizes and a power - law decay at medium and large sizes is found in the intermediate range of values of the driving rate for a wide range of level of conservation .",
    "power - law behaviors are robust even though their exponents depend on the system parameters ( e.g. , driving rate and level of conservation , see below ) .",
    "although the critical nature of landslides is not fully assessed and many authors believe that deviations from power law appear to be systematic for small landslides data @xcite , results from several regional landslide inventories show robust power - law distributions of medium and large events with a critical exponent @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the variation in the exponents of landslide size distributions is larger than in the other natural hazards that exhibit scale - invariant size statistics @xcite .",
    "whether this variation of @xmath0 is caused by scatter in the data or because different exponents are associated with different geology , is an important open question , which we may contribute to address .",
    "the model we analyze describes the evolution of a space and time dependent factor of safety field .",
    "the factor of safety ( @xmath2 ) is defined as the ratio between resisting forces and driving forces .",
    "it is a complicate function of many dynamical variables ( pore water pressure , lithostatic stress , cohesion coefficients , etc . )",
    "whose rate of change is crucial in the characterization of landslide events .",
    "a landslide event may include a single landslide or many thousands .",
    "we investigate frequency - size distributions of landslide events by varying the driving rate of the factor of safety .",
    "although our probability density distributions are lacking of a direct comparison with frequency - size distributions of real landslides they reproduce power - law scaling with an exponent very close to the observed values .",
    "moreover , they allow us to get insight into the difficult problem of the determination of possible precursors of future events .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the model and briefly discuss the differences between our approach and previous cellular automata models that have been recently introduced to characterize landslide frequency - size distributions . in section iii ,",
    "we report numerical results obtained by a systematic investigation of the effects of a finite driving rate on the frequency - size distribution .",
    "the values of the exponent of the power - law decay are given as a function of the driving rate and the level of conservation .",
    "an accurate analysis of the spatial distribution of the values of the factor of safety by varying the driving rate provides useful information for quantifying hazard scenarios of possible avalanche events . in section iv",
    ", we analyze the role of anisotropic transfer coefficients , which control the propagation of the instability .",
    "we summarize our results in a phase diagram that shows the location of power - law and non power - law scaling regions in the anisotropy parameter space .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "the instability in clays often starts from a small region , destabilizes the neighborhood and then propagates @xcite . such a progressive slope failure recalls the spreading of avalanches in the fundamental models of soc .",
    "the term self - organized criticality ( soc ) was coined by bak , tang and wiesenfeld to describe the phenomenon observed in a particular cellular automaton model , nowadays known as the sandpile model @xcite . in the original sandpile model",
    ", the system is perturbed externally by a random addition of sand grains .",
    "once the slope between two contiguous cells has reached a threshold value , a fixed amount of sand is transferred to its neighbors generating a chain reaction or avalanche .",
    "the non - cumulative number of avalanches @xmath3 with area @xmath4 satisfies a power - law distribution with a critical exponent @xmath5 @xcite , which is much smaller than the values of the power - law exponents observed for landslides @xcite .",
    "few years later the paper of bak et al .",
    "@xcite , olami , feder and christensen ( ofc ) recognized the dynamics of earthquakes as a physical realization of self - organized criticality and introduced a cellular automaton that gives a good prediction of the gutenberg - richter law @xcite . such a model , whose physical background belongs to the burridge - knopoff spring - block model @xcite , is based on a continuous dynamical variable which increases uniformly through time till reaches a given threshold and relaxes .",
    "this means that the dynamical variable decreases , while a part of the loss is transferred to the nearest neighbors .",
    "if this transfer causes one of the neighbors to reach the threshold value , it relaxes too , resulting in a chain reaction .",
    "ofc recognized that the model still exhibits power - law scaling in the non - conservative regime , even if the power - law exponent strongly depends on the level of conservation .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role of a finite driving rate and of anisotropy in a non - conservative cellular automaton modeling landslides @xcite .",
    "in such a model , we sketch a natural slope by using a square grid where each site @xmath6 is characterized by a local value of the safety factor @xmath7 . in slope stability analysis ,",
    "the factor of safety , @xmath2 , against slip is defined in terms of the ratio of the maximum shear strength @xmath8 to the disturbing shear stress @xmath9 @xmath10 the limited amount of stress that a site can support is given by the empirical mohr - coulomb failure criterion : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total normal stress , @xmath13 is the pore - fluid pressure , @xmath14 is the angle of internal friction of the soil and @xmath15 is the cohesional ( non - frictional ) component of the soil strength @xcite .",
    "if @xmath16 , resisting forces exceed driving forces and the slope remains stable .",
    "slope failure starts when @xmath17 . since a natural slope is a complex non - homogeneous system characterized by the presence of composite diffusion , dissipative and driving mechanisms acting in the soil ( such as those on the water content ) , we consider time and site dependent safety factor @xmath7 and treat the local inverse factor of safety @xmath18 as the non - conserved dynamical variable of our cellular automata model @xcite .",
    "the long - term driving of the ofc model is , here , replaced by a dynamical rule which causes the increases of @xmath19 through the time with a finite driving rate @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "such a rule allows us to simulate the effect on the factor of safety of different complex processes which can change the state of stress of a cell .",
    "the model is driven as long as @xmath22 on all sites @xmath6 .",
    "then , when a site , say @xmath6 , becomes unstable ( i.e. , exceeds the threshold , @xmath23 ) it relaxes with its neighbors according to the rule : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the nearest neighbors of site @xmath6 and @xmath26 is the fraction of @xmath19 toppling on @xmath25 .",
    "this relaxation rule is considered to be instantaneous compared to the time scale of the overall drive and lasts until all sites remain below the threshold . when @xmath19 reaches the threshold value @xmath27 and relaxes , the fraction of @xmath19 moving from the site @xmath6 to its `` downward '' ( resp . `` upward '' ) neighbor on the square grid is @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) , as @xmath30 is the fraction to each of its `` left '' and `` right '' neighbors .",
    "the transfer parameters @xmath26 are chosen in order to individuate a privileged transfer direction : we assume @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we notice that the model reproduces features of the ofc model for earthquakes in the limit case @xmath33 and @xmath34 . a detailed analysis of the model on varying the transfer coefficients @xmath26",
    "is reported in sec .",
    "iv .    since many complex dissipative phenomena ( such as evaporation mechanism , volume contractions , etc .",
    "@xcite ) contribute to a dissipative stress transfer in gravity - driven failures , we study the model in the non - conservative case @xmath35 , which makes our approach different from previous ones within the framework of soc @xcite . the conservation level , @xmath36 , and the anisotropy factors , which we consider here to be uniform , are actually related to local soil properties ( e.g. , lithostatic , frictional and cohesional properties ) , as well as to the local geometry of the slope ( e.g. , its morphology ) .",
    "the rate of change of the inverse factor of safety , @xmath20 , induced by the external drive ( e.g. , rainfall ) , in turn related to soil and slope properties , quantifies how the triggering mechanisms affect the time derivative of the fs field .",
    "recently , in order to reproduce the range of the power - law exponents observed for landslides , several authors have used two - threshold cellular automata , which relate landslide dynamics to self - organization @xcite or to the vicinity of a breakdown point @xcite . in the first approach @xcite , a time - dependent criterion for stability , with a not easy interpretation in terms of governing physics ,",
    "provides a power - law exponent close to 2 without any tuning .",
    "therefore , this approach does not explain the observed variability of @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the range of @xmath0 is found by tuning the maximum value of the ratio between the thresholds of two failure modes , the shear failure and the slab failure .",
    "however , the frequency - size distribution of avalanches is obtained by counting only clusters where shear failures have occurred , considering conservative transfer processes between adjacent cells with a different number of nearest neighbors . in this paper , the investigation of our non - conservative cellular automaton is mainly devoted to the characterization of landslide event dynamics on varying the driving rate in order to analyze different hazard scenarios .",

    "the logarithm of the normalized number of model events , @xmath37 $ ] , in which a specified number of different cells , @xmath38 , become unstable , is given as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "we show the case @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42.,width=302 ]    frequency - size distributions give the number of landslides ( events ) as a function of their size .",
    "in fig.[scaling ] we show the non - cumulative frequency - size distributions obtained for different values of the driving rate in the anisotropic non conservative case @xmath40 , with @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "the curves are obtained for a square lattice of size @xmath44 .",
    "we considered both cylindrical ( open along the vertical axis and periodical along the horizontal axis ) and open boundary conditions , which we checked differ in the slopes of the distribution curves for less than @xmath45 .",

    "we consider the case @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42.,width=302 ]    in the limit of vanishing driving rate , the distribution of events , @xmath46 , is similar to that of the two - dimensional isotropic ofc model for a fixed value of the level of conservation : a power law characterized by a critical exponent @xmath0 , @xmath47 , followed by a system finite - size dependent exponential cutoff @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by increasing the driving rate @xmath20 , the probability distribution develops a maximum , which shifts towards larger events with @xmath20 . on the left side of the maximum , a power - law decay , with exponent @xmath48 ( see the fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) , seems to appear for small landslide sizes .",
    "however , the few available data do not allow to distinguish log - log linear shape and an exponential one @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    let us come back to fig.[scaling ] in order to highlight the role of the driving rate in the characterization of landslide events . from the distributions of fig.[scaling ]",
    ", we see that large events can have comparatively high probabilities in the power - law regime ( i.e. , at small driving rates @xmath20 ) with respect to the gaussian regime ( i.e. , larger @xmath20 ) .",
    "such a feature could allow to reproduce the observation that sometimes mild rainfalls produce landslides as large as those triggered by intense rainfalls . to underline the nonlinear behavior of the system with @xmath20 , in fig.[ep ] we plot the sizes of avalanches with the same probability of occurrence for different values of the driving rate .",
    "such sizes are the intersections of horizontal straight lines with the distribution curves of fig.[scaling ] .",
    "when we consider small events ( i.e. , @xmath46 as large as @xmath54 ) , we find that the size of equiprobable events increases with the driving rate .",
    "thus , for equiprobable events with high probability of occurrence the system response is essentially linear with the driving rate .",
    "instead , for large events ( i.e. , @xmath46 as small as @xmath55 ) , the size of equiprobable events has a maximum as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "thus , it appears that , for a given range of @xmath20 values , the size of events caused by a slow rate of changes of the factor of safety can be larger than the size of avalanches triggered by a faster rate .",
    "moreover , an evidence is found for the existence of the most _ dangerous _ value of @xmath20 , for which the size of the system response has a maximum .",
    "the detection of possible precursors of a landslide event is a crucial step to achieve hazard reduction . in order to get insight into this difficult problem",
    ", we visualize the structure of a typical landslide event for different values of the driving rate @xmath20 . in the top row of fig.[map ] , we report on the @xmath56 grid a typical avalanche of size @xmath57 on increasing the value of @xmath20 from left to right . the @xmath58 black cells are those that have reached the instability threshold .",
    "as we can see , compact landslides are the characteristic response of a system governed by power - law statistics as it happens at small @xmath20 ( also when a maximum in the frequency - size distribution develops ) .",
    "such a response is typical of systems with soc behavior @xcite . by increasing the driving rate ,",
    "compact clusters survive until power - law regime disappears . as the system enters the non power - law regime , the relevance of domino effects drastically drops and landslide events",
    "are characterized by many tiny independent clusters .    in the bottom row of fig.[map ] , we show the distribution of the factor of safety @xmath59 for the cases corresponding to the upper panels @xcite .",
    "the distribution on the grid of the values shows how the spatial correlations in the system crucially affect landslide structures . in order to measure the distance of a cell from its instability condition and to visualize the correlated areas ( regions with similar values of @xmath7 ) , the values of @xmath7",
    "have been associated to ten levels of a gray scale from white to black : the darker the color , the farther is the cell from the instability threshold . in the snapshots of fig.[map ] , it is possible to recognize as dark areas the avalanches shown in the corresponding upper grids .",
    "in particular , the dark areas typically are related to previous landslide events , whereas the lighter areas indicate regions of future events .",
    "we notice that in the power law regime ( i.e. small @xmath20 ) even a very small perturbation ( say , a drop of water ) at one single point can trigger huge system responses .",
    "instead , in the non power - law regime ( i.e. large @xmath20 ) large - scale correlations are absent ; here large events trivially occur just because the strong external driving rate makes likely that many cells simultaneously approach the instability threshold .",
    "thus , the detection of patterns of correlated domains in investigated areas results to be a crucial tool to identify the response of the system to perturbations , i.e. , to hazard assessment .",
    "it is worth noticing that the average value of the factor of safety on the grid cells @xmath60 and its fluctuation @xmath61 are very similar in the four cases showed in fig.[map ] , encompassing a broad spectrum of @xmath20 values .",
    "interestingly , the probability distribution of @xmath2 on the grid sites , independently of the driving rate , is well approximated by a gaussian distribution .",
    "this suggests that a measure of just an average safety factor on the investigated area could provide only a very partial information about the statistics governing the considered landslide events .",
    "in the previous sections , we have investigated the properties of the model on varying the driving rate @xmath20 at fixed values of the anisotropic ratios @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "such parameters control how the instability propagates downward and , therefore , they are complicate functions of the topography and geology of a specific area . in this section ,",
    "we are interested in the analysis of the model when such transfer coefficients vary .",
    "it is well - known that the one - dimensional version of the sandpile and ofc models are characterized by non power - law scaling @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that , for small values of the ratio @xmath64 , the frequency - size distribution does not show power - law behavior .",
    "viceversa , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we expect to have power - law distributions , as in the ofc model , which corresponds in our model to the limit @xmath67 and @xmath33 .",
    "the diagram of fig.[phd ] summarizes the different regimes found in our simulations at fixed values of the driving rate @xmath68 and the level of conservation @xmath40 .",
    "we find that , on varying the anisotropic ratios , the parameter space is divided in three regions : _",
    "i ) _ a power - law region ( pl ) characterized by power - law frequency - size distributions for large values of the anisotropic ratios , _ ii ) _ a non power - law region ( npl ) for the whole range of values of the anisotropic ratio @xmath62 ( which controls the redistribution of load in the vertical direction ) and small values of @xmath64 , _ iii ) _ a finite - size oscillation region ( fso ) where the frequency - size distribution is characterized by periodic peaks , which appear for integer multiples of the grid size @xmath69 .     vs. @xmath64 plane .",
    "the lines divide the parameter space in three regions : a power - law scaling region ( pl ) , a non power - law scaling region ( npl ) and a finite - size oscillation region ( fso ) where peaks of the distribution commensurate with the size of the grid appear .",
    "the results are obtained for @xmath68 and @xmath40.,width=302 ]    as expected , we find power - law and non power - law behaviors for large and small values of the anisotropic ratios , respectively . in particular , we find that the value of the critical exponent @xmath0 of the power - law distribution slightly increases with @xmath62 for a fixed value of @xmath64 and decreases with @xmath64 for a fixed value of @xmath62",
    ". however , the changes in @xmath0 are negligible .    it is worth noticing that , even if the ratio @xmath64 is quite large , we find that the frequency - size distribution does not show a power law decay when the value of @xmath62 is small , ( see fig.[phd ] ) . indeed , the probability distribution develops a finite number of peaks which are commensurate with the size of the grid .",
    "fig.[peaks ] shows the frequency - size distribution for two different values of the anisotropic ratios in the fso region of the phase diagram . by increasing @xmath64 ,",
    "the peaks of the distributions turn down as long as they disappear .",
    "we m that several peaks in the distribution of avalanche sizes are obtained in ref .",
    "the authors vary the convexity of the driving @xmath70 and the level of conservation @xmath71 in the isotropic case : @xmath72 when @xmath73 .",
    "they find an intermediate region of the phase - diagram @xmath71 vs. @xmath70 where the frequency - size distribution is characterized by peaks that scale with different powers of the system size @xmath74 .",
    "fixing the convexity of the driving @xmath70 ( @xmath75 for a uniform driving ) , for large values of the level of conservation , @xmath76 , the peaks disappear and they get a power - law decay with an exponential cutoff .",
    "conversely , we find commensurate peaks in the fso region in the whole range @xmath51 $ ] .     grid for @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( triangles ) and @xmath79 ( squares ) .",
    "the inset shows the distribution curves in a log - linear scale for the range of values where commensurate peaks are observed .",

    "they find that the anisotropy has almost no effect on the power - law exponent while the scaling exponent , expressing how the finite - size cutoff scales with the system size , changes continuously from a two - dimensional to a one dimensional scaling of the avalanches @xcite .",
