    "chandrasekhar formulated the principle of dynamical friction under the assumptions of an infinite , homogeneous and isotropic field of stars ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) . despite these simplifications",
    ", his theory has been shown to work remarkably well in a wide variety of more general situations .",
    "dynamical friction can be understood as the drag induced on a test particle by the overdensity ( i.e. , the gravitational wake ) that is raised behind it by the deflection of stars @xcite .",
    "the surprisingly good agreement between theory and numerical results may be attributed to the fact that the wake is a local structure , and over small spatial scales , the stellar background appears nearly homogeneous @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical studies have revealed a few , astrophysically important contexts in which chandrasekhar s theory appears to break down .",
    "these include the deceleration of a rotating stellar bar @xcite , inspiral in harmonic ( constant - density ) cores @xcite , and the orbital evolution of a displaced supermassive black hole @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive study of dynamical friction in the nuclei of galaxies containing a dominant central point mass . in particular , we investigate the case of shallow density profiles around supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "such nuclei appear to be common , and perhaps even generic .",
    "for instance , the luminosity profiles of bright elliptical galaxies always exhibit flat central cores @xcite . even the milky way , which was long believed to have a steeply - rising mass density near sgr a@xmath2 ,",
    "is now believed to have a parsec - scale core @xcite .",
    "similar models may also be applicable to dark matter halos , if the central point mass is identified with the stellar spheroid @xcite .",
    "theoretical treatments of dynamical friction make a surprising prediction about the frictional force in such systems . essentially all of the decelerating force is predicted to come from stars that are moving more slowly than the test body .",
    "but the phase - space density of a galaxy with a shallow density cusp around a smbh falls to zero at low energies : below a certain radius ( roughly 1/2 the core radius ) , there are no stars locally that move more slowly than the circular velocity at that radius .",
    "chandrasekhar s formula , in its most widely - used form , would predict no frictional force . in the case of an eccentric orbit that passes in and out of the core",
    ", the frictional force would be small near periapsis , leading to a rapid increase in orbital eccentricity  the opposite of the usual assumption .",
    "our numerical experiments reveal that the frictional force does not drop precisely to zero in such nuclei .",
    "we show that the evolution can be well described by a more general form formula that includes a contribution to the force from stars moving faster than the test mass . in this sense ,",
    "our results affirm the correctness of chandrasekhar s physical picture , but only if the proper field - star velocity distribution is used ( as opposed to , say , a maxwellian ) , and only if the usual simplifying assumptions that lead to a neglect of the contribution of the fast stars to the frictional force are relaxed .",
    "in  2 we review chandrasekhar s derivation of the dynamical friction force and highlight the approximations that lead to the neglect of the contribution from the fast - moving stars .",
    "we also briefly discuss alternative treatments of dynamical friction . in ",
    "3 we use chandrasekhar s formulae to integrate the equations of motion of a massive body and follow its inspiral into the center of a model designed to represent the galactic center . in ",
    "4 we use large - scale @xmath0-body simulations to test the theory in the case of inspiral of massive objects in a nuclear star cluster with a flat density profile .",
    " 5 investigates the formation of the gravitational wake in the self consistent simulations .",
    "applications of our results to a variety of astrophysical problems are discussed in  6 , and  7 sums up .",
    "the motivation for the @xmath0-body experiments described in this paper is the existence of physically interesting models of galactic nuclei in which the standard dynamical friction formula predicts little , or zero , frictional force .",
    "we begin in this section by re - deriving the standard formula , noting the simplifying approximations that are usually made .",
    "we then present the more general form of chandrasekhar s formula that includes contributions from field stars of all velocities , not just those that move more slowly than the test body at infinity , and we evaluate the expected contribution from the fast - moving stars in our models .",
    "we also compute how the fast- and slow - moving stars contribute differently to the steady - state density wake , using a technique first applied by mulder ( 1983 ) .",
    "finally we comment on perturbative approaches to computing dynamical friction that relax the assumption of an infinite homogeneous medium .",
    "the results obtained in this section constitute a set of baselines against which the @xmath0-body results can be compared .",
    "@xcite derived the coefficient of dynamical friction by summing the encounters of a test body with passing stars , assuming that the unperturbed motion of the test body was linear and unaccelerated , and that the field star distribution was infinite and homogeneous spatially and isotropic in velocity space .",
    "the velocity change of a test body of mass @xmath3 in one encounter with a field star of mass @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative velocity at infinity , @xmath7 is the impact parameter , and @xmath8 . the velocity change in equation  ( [ dvp ] ) is parallel to the initial , relative velocity @xmath9 before the encounter . in order to derive the coefficient of dynamical friction , one sums the velocity changes in the direction of motion of the test mass , per unit interval of time , over all impact parameters and over all values for the relative velocity at infinity .",
    "the summation over impact parameters , at fixed @xmath6 , is achieved by multiplying equation  ( [ dvp ] ) by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the number density of field stars , and integrating @xmath12 : @xmath13 under the assumption that @xmath14 , this can be written as @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{coef1}\\ ] ] terms beyond the first in brackets , the so - called `` non - dominant '' terms , are usually neglected .",
    "returning to the more general form ( [ eq : dvp ] ) , the dynamical friction coefficient is obtained by a second integration over field star velocities @xmath16 .",
    "the relative velocity is @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the velocity of the test star . since equation  ( [ eq : dvp ] ) gives the velocity change in the direction of the initial relative motion , it must be multiplied by = to convert it into a velocity change in the direction of the test star s motion , assumed here to be along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "let@xmath20 be the number density of field stars in velocity increment @xmath21 , normalized to unit total number .",
    "the dynamical friction coefficient is @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "henceforth we assume that the field star distribution is isotropic in velocity space .",
    "following @xcite , we represent the velocity - space volume element in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath6 using v - v__x = v^2+v^2-v_^22v.the result is    [ equation : df2 ]    @xmath25    ( the quantity @xmath26 defined in equation  ( 26 ) of chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) is equal to @xmath27 . ) the integral that defines @xmath28 turns out to have an analytic solution ; the expression is complicated and we do not reproduce it here .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) gave several approximate forms for @xmath28 valid for @xmath29 , e.g. his equation  ( 30 ) : @xmath30    in the standard approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the non - dominant terms are set to zero , and the velocity dependence of the logarithmic term in the integrand of equation  ( [ equation : df2 ] ) is ignored .",
    "instead , one writes @xmath31 and the lower bound @xmath32 is set to @xmath33 .",
    "the weighting function @xmath28 then takes on the simple form @xmath34 and the coefficient of dynamical friction is @xmath35 equation ( [ eq : dfh1 ] ) reproduces the well - known result that only field stars with @xmath36 contribute to the frictional force .    in this paper",
    ", we consider models for galactic nuclei in which the number of stars moving more slowly than the test body can be vanishingly small . in such models",
    ", one expects that a significant fraction of the frictional force might come from stars with @xmath37 .",
    "the distribution of field - star velocities in our models has the following form within the core : @xmath38 where the normalizing constant f_0 = corresponds to unit total number .",
    "this expression is equivalent to equation  ( [ df ] ) ; it gives the local distribution of velocities at a radius where the circular velocity is @xmath39 , assuming the density of field stars follows @xmath40 .",
    "the phase space density is zero for @xmath41 .    of more interest here",
    "is the behavior of @xmath42 at small values of @xmath24 , and when @xmath43 ; for such values of @xmath44 the phase space density diverges at @xmath45 . as @xmath46 ,",
    "the velocity distribution becomes progressively narrower , and in the limit , @xmath47 is a delta - function at @xmath45 ; in other words , all stars have zero energy .",
    "this may be seen as a consequence of the well - known fact that @xmath48 is the shallowest power law density profile consistent with an isotropic velocity distribution in a point - mass potential .    in the case of a test body moving in a circular orbit with @xmath49",
    ", the number of field stars with @xmath36 will drop as @xmath44 approaches @xmath50 , and will equal zero in the limiting case @xmath51 .",
    "the standard dynamical friction coefficient , equation  ( [ eq : dfh1 ] ) , predicts zero frictional force in this limit .",
    "in this situation , it is clearly of interest to compute the contribution of the fast - moving stars to the total frictional force .",
    "we did this by evaluating @xmath28 in its `` exact '' form , equation  ( [ equation : df2b ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dv2 ] shows the results .",
    "in addition to @xmath44 , the results depend on the parameter ( ) which plays the role of coulomb logarithm .",
    "we note the following results .",
    "* for @xmath52 , the contribution to the frictional force from the fast - moving stars is negligible , particularly when @xmath53 is also large . * for @xmath54 ,",
    "the fast - moving stars contribute a progressively larger fraction of the total frictional force , particularly when @xmath53 is small .",
    "* when @xmath55 , near the limiting value , the total frictional force is small , and almost all of it comes from stars with @xmath37 . *",
    "whereas the contribution to the force from the slow - moving stars depends strongly on @xmath44 , the contribution from the fast - moving stars is almost independent of @xmath44 .    according to equation  ( [ hap ] )",
    ", the contribution of the fast stars must tend to zero as @xmath53 is made sufficiently large .",
    "this is consistent with figure  [ fig : dv2 ] ; however , for @xmath56 , the value of @xmath53 required for the slow stars to dominate is far greater than any physically reasonable value .",
    "the foregoing treatment highlighted the contribution of the fast - moving stars , @xmath37 , to the total frictional force .",
    "however it did not provide much insight into why the two populations contribute in such a different way to the force .",
    "of course , the @xmath0-body experiments described in this paper include both populations of stars . in the simulations ,",
    "the field stars quickly establish a nearly steady - state distribution in a frame moving with the test mass  a `` dynamical - friction wake ''   @xcite .",
    "the over - density in the wake is responsible for the decelerating force that acts on the test body .",
    "a large fraction of the mass in the wake must be contributed by the fast stars , particularly in the case that the fast stars dominate the density at large distances .",
    "why then do these stars contribute relatively little to the frictional force ?",
    "one way to address this question is via the technique of @xcite .",
    "mulder computed the steady - state distributions of stars around a moving test mass , making essentially the same assumptions as made by @xcite .",
    "he did this by invoking jeans s theorem in a frame moving with the test mass , and showing that an isotropic @xmath47 at infinity could be expressed in terms of two of the integrals of motion in the kepler problem .",
    "this then allowed him to compute the steady - state density , in the moving frame , at all locations around the test mass .",
    "the dynamical friction force followed from a second integration of the density over space ; mulder showed that the results for the frictional force so obtained were consistent with chandrasekhar s predictions , if @xmath57 were associated with the maximum dimension of the spatial grid used to carry out the force integration .",
    "mulder s technique can be modified , to compute the separate contributions to the dynamical friction _ wake _ of the fast ( @xmath37 ) and slow ( @xmath36 ) stars ; here , as above , @xmath24 refers to the field - star velocity at infinity .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : mulder ] , for @xmath58 . for this choice of @xmath44 ,",
    "the fast stars dominate the total density at infinity .",
    "the density that they generate near the test body is also higher , everywhere along the symmetry axis , than the density due to the slow stars .",
    "however the shapes of the two density wakes are very different : in the case of the fast stars , the wake is elongated counter to the direction of the test body s motion , while in the direction parallel to the motion , the change in density between the upstream and downstream sides of the test mass is much less than in the case of the wake produced by the slow stars .",
    "these two differences are responsible for the small contribution of the fast stars to the total frictional force ( figure  1 ) , in spite of the higher density of those stars at infinity and in the wake .",
    "comparison of the upstream and downstream densities in figure  2 also suggests why the relative contribution of the fast stars to the frictional force drops off with increasing @xmath53 in chandrasekhar s treatment ( figure  1 ) . at large distances from the test body ,",
    "the wake produced by the fast stars is nearly symmetric ; the greatest asymmetry is in the region near the test mass .",
    "the wake generated by the slow stars , on the other hand , maintains its asymmetry much farther from the test body .",
    "roughly speaking , the density far from the origin in figure 2 is produced by stars with large impact parameters , and so increasing @xmath57 in chandrasekhar s treatment corresponds to more heavily weighting the contribution from the slow - moving stars .      in treatments like chandrasekhar s and mulder s ,",
    "the unperturbed trajectories consist of straight lines . in reality , both test and field stars follow non - rectilinear orbits about the center of the galaxy .",
    "chandrasekhar s theory might be expected to give approximately correct results even in this case , as long as @xmath59 , since over many decades in scale the orbits of the field stars will appear nearly rectilinear as seen by the test body . but given certain assumptions , perturbation theory can be used to more correctly compute the response of the orbits in a galaxy to the presence of a perturbing potential @xcite .",
    "one finds that the net torque on the test mass is due to orbits near resonance , i.e. orbits for which the frequencies associated with the radial and angular motions satisfy a relation @xmath60 where the @xmath61 are integers and @xmath62 is the frequency of rotation of the test mass ( assumed to be on a circular orbit ) .",
    "the acceleration induced by the resonant orbits depends on how quickly the orbit of the test mass is evolving ; if orbital decay is very slow , the influence of a single resonance can build up , invalidating the perturbative assumption , while if it is too fast , the assumption of near - stationarity is violated . furthermore , in a real galaxy ( or @xmath0-body system ) the frequency spectrum of the perturbing potential is not made up of sharp lines , but rather is broadened by the time dependence of the decaying orbit and by the finite age of the galaxy .    due to the computational complexity involved , applications of this approach",
    "have so far been limited to bodies following circular orbits in simple ( plummer , scale - free ) galaxy models , and the results have mostly been interpreted as corrections to the predictions of mulder and chandrasekhar .",
    "for instance , @xcite emphasized the similarity in the structure of the wake as computed via the perturbation formulae and via mulder s approach .",
    "the main element that the perturbative treatments add is a quantitative estimate of the coulomb logarithm .",
    "not surprisingly , none of these studies has attempted to relate the frictional force separately to the `` fast '' and `` slow '' stars as they appear in chandrasekhar s treatment ; doing so would be an ill - defined problem since all stars are included , self - consistently , in the perturbative treatments .",
    "nevertheless , as far as we can tell , comparisons with chandrasekhar s theory are always made via equation  ( [ eq : dfh1 ] ) , which ignores the fast - moving stars .",
    "a potentially important application of the perturbative methods is to cases where the assumption of locality is violated .",
    "for instance , a satellite that orbits just outside a galaxy , where the local density is zero , would experience no frictional force if the local properties of the background were assumed to hold everywhere ; in reality it feels a force due to polarization of the orbits inside the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the models considered in this paper constitute a second case where the assumption of locality may be inappropriate , since some of the frictional force acting on a test mass orbiting in the core will come from stars outside the core , where @xmath63 has a different functional form , including ( for instance ) some slow - moving stars . in lieu of such a calculation",
    "( and in view of the difficulties associated with interpreting the results ; e.g. @xcite ) , an @xmath0-body treatment seems a logical first step .",
    "as we will see , chandrasekhar s formula , in its more general form , turns out to reproduce the @xmath0-body results quite well .",
    "we are interested in the orbital evolution of a massive body as it spirals in toward the center of a galaxy that contains a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we present results from large - scale , direct - summation @xmath0-body simulations . as a basis for comparison , we present in this section the predictions of chandrasekhar s approximate formula .",
    "we represent the stars via a smooth , fixed potential and integrate the equations of motion of the massive body in the fixed analytic potential including a term that represents the non - conservative contribution of dynamical friction .",
    "we base our model for the stellar density on the observed distribution of old stars at the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "number counts @xcite are consistent with a density that follows a broken power - law : @xmath64^{(\\gamma-\\gamma_{e})/{\\alpha}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a parameter that defines the transition strength between inner and outer power laws and @xmath66 is the scale radius .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath67pc , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as fiducial values . the central slope @xmath44 was left as a free parameter .",
    "the normalizing factor @xmath70 was chosen in such a way that for each value of @xmath44 , the corresponding density profile reproduces the coreless density model : @xmath71 outside the core .",
    "this choice of normalizing constant gives a mass density at @xmath72 similar to what various authors have inferred ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and implies a total mass in stars within this radius of @xmath73 .",
    "assuming equal - mass stars of mass @xmath74 and an isotropic velocity distribution , the local two - body relaxation time is defined as @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath77 is the isotropic velocity dispersion ; the latter can be computed from jeans s equation , @xmath78\\rho(r ' ) .",

    "as predicted , for @xmath136 , the eccentricity remains unchanged in this phase .",

    "first - ranked galaxies in clusters are often observed to contain multiple `` nuclei , '' which may be identified with the tidally - truncated remains of inspiralling galaxies  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we considered the orbital evolution of massive objects in nuclei with shallow density profiles around supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "our principle results are summarized below .",
    "* orbital evolution can be very sensitive to the details of the stellar distribution . in models with a flat central density profile , @xmath441 , @xmath135 ,",
    "the dynamical friction timescale is much longer than in models with a steep cusp due to the lack of low - velocity stars .",
    "the standard formula predicts that the inspiraling body will stall at a radius that is roughly @xmath50 the core radius . *",
    "orbital eccentricity increases rapidly when the periapsis falls inside the core .",
    "if the inspiralling body is initially at @xmath96 with @xmath442 , its orbital eccentricity can become very large ( @xmath443 ) by the time the orbit lies entirely inside the core . * using @xmath0-body simulations , we found that the frictional force never falls precisely to zero . when the contribution of the fast - moving stars is included in the expression for the dynamical friction force , and ( if appropriate )",
    "the changes induced by the massive body on the stellar distribution are taken into account , chandrasekhar s theory reproduces the decay observed in the @xmath0-body simulations very accurately . on the other hand ,",
    "a straightforward application of chandrasekhar s formula in its standard form can give misleading results .",
    "* if the mass of the inspiralling object is sufficiently large , it promotes the diffusion of stars into the phase - space region that was initially nearly empty , increasing the dynamical friction force .",
    "a low - density core is again regenerated as the object displaces these stars .",
    "* we derived an estimate of the coulomb logarithm without any particular assumptions about the velocity distribution of field stars ( e.g. , that it follows a maxwellian distribution ) , and in the region outside the core , where the standard dynamical friction formula ( [ dfa ] ) accurately represents the motion .",
    "we obtained @xmath444 , consistent with previous work .",
    "* we studied the location and evolution of the gravitational wake that the inspiralling body induces in the stellar background .",
    "outside the core , the peak in the overdensity lies close to the massive body at @xmath261 , independent of @xmath3 , and the amplitude of the overdensity increases with black hole mass .",
    "after the massive body enters the core , the density maximum decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the frictional drag is greatly reduced inside the shallow cusp .",
    "* in the absence of a steep central density cusp , the time for stellar - mass black holes to reach the center of the milky way from a starting radius of order @xmath445 can easily exceed @xmath446 .",
    "we computed the evolution of a population of stellar black holes as they segregate to the galactic center , including the frictional force from the fast - moving stars .",
    "we found that , in models with parsec - scale cores , even after @xmath328gyr , the density of black holes can remain substantially lower than that in stars at all radii .",
    "we conclude that it would be unjustified to assume that the massive remnants have yet reached a steady - state distribution at the galactic center . *",
    "secondary black holes reach the gravitational radiation dominated regime on orbits that are typically very eccentric .",
    "however , we found that even initially moderate eccentricities would result in non - negligible eccentricities at the moment the binary black hole enters the sensitivity window of planned space - based interferometers .",
    "this in turn would require non - circular templates for gravitational wave data analysis .",

    "<S> the density of stars in galactic bulges is often observed to be flat or slowly rising inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) . attributing the dynamical friction force to stars moving more slowly than the test body , as is commonly done , is likely to be a poor approximation in such a core since there are no stars moving more slowly than the local circular velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested this prediction using large - scale @xmath0-body experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero , because stars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force . when the contribution from the fast - moving stars is included in the expression for the dynamical friction force , and the changes induced by the massive body on the stellar distribution are taken into account , chandrasekhar s theory is found to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> however , this rate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by chandrasekhar s formula in its most widely - used forms , implying longer time scales for inspiral . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec - scale core around the galactic center smbh , we investigate the evolution of a population of stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) as they spiral in to the center of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath1 gyr , we find that the density of bhs can remain substantially less than the density in stars at all radii ; we conclude that it would be unjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of bhs at the galactic center is well described by steady - state models . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that rates of capture of bhs by the smbh at the galactic center ( emris ) may be much lower than in standard models . </S>",
    "<S> when capture occurs , inspiraling bhs often reach the gravitational - radiation - dominated regime while on orbits that are still highly eccentric ; even after the semi - major axis has decreased to values small enough for detection by space - based interferometers , eccentricities can be large enough that the efficient analysis of gravitational wave signals would require the use of eccentric templates . </S>",
    "<S> we finally study the orbital decay of satellite galaxies into the central region of giant ellipticals and discuss the formation of multiple nuclei and multiplet of black holes in such systems . </S>"
