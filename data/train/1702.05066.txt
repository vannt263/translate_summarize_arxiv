    "the @xmath1-dimensional gaussian distribution @xmath2 can be defined by its probability density function @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean vector and the symmetric positive definite @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 is the covariance matrix .",
    "this density has a unique absolute maximum at @xmath7 .",
    "now , we consider a mixture distribution @xmath8 consisting of @xmath0 gaussian components @xmath9 and mixture weights @xmath10 for @xmath11 , so that : @xmath12 this is again a probability density function given that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , the density for a gaussian mixture is a convex combination of gaussian densities .",
    "such mixtures can exhibit quite complex behavior even for a small number @xmath0 of components .",
    "this is a feature that makes it attractive for modeling in applications",
    ".    we will be interested in the maximal number @xmath15 of local maxima for @xmath1-dimensional gaussian mixtures with @xmath0 components .",
    "this is a property of a gaussian mixture density with fixed parameters and no sample involved ; it should not be confused with the number of local maxima of the likelihood function of a gaussian mixture model ( a relevant but different question , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as stated in the introduction , a single gaussian has a unique mode , that is , @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . the simplest case when there is actually a mixture has @xmath18 and @xmath19 : a mixture of two univariate gaussians @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with mixture parameter @xmath22 .",
    "it was observed historically that in this scenario the number of modes was either @xmath23 or @xmath24 , with the following heuristics :    * if the distance between the modes is small , then the mixture is unimodal ( independently of @xmath25 ) . *",
    "if the distance between the modes is large enough , then there is bimodality unless @xmath25 is close to @xmath26 or @xmath23 .",
    "cohen ( 1953 ) and eisenberger ( 1964 ) obtained some first explicit conditions in these directions @xcite .",
    "notably , if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then the mixture is unimodal ( with mode at @xmath29 ) if and only if @xmath30 . a few years later , j. behboodian gives a proof that indeed @xmath31 by bounding the number of critical points of the density , and finds that @xmath32 is a sufficient condition for unimodality .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath33 , then @xmath34 is again a sufficient condition for having only one mode in the mixture . starting the 21st century",
    ", it was carreira - perpin and williams who had particular interest in the problem @xcite . using scale - space theory , they prove that @xmath35 ; any univariate gaussian mixture with @xmath0 components has a most @xmath0 modes .",
    "a natural conjecture is that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "however , this fails already when @xmath38 , since a mixture of two bivariate gaussians can have 3 distinct modes ( and actually , @xmath39 ) .",
    "consider @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "there are two modes close to the original means at @xmath43 and @xmath44 but there is also a third mode near the origin .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : mixtbiv ] , with the two means marked in blue and the three modes marked in red .",
    "special attention can be paid to assumptions on the variances .",
    "a mixture is said to be _",
    "if all the variances in the components are equal : @xmath45 for @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "a mixture is said to be _ isotropic _ if @xmath46 for @xmath11 , so that covariances are scalar matrices and the densities have a ` spherical ' shape .",
    "note that , up to coordinate change , homoscedastic mixtures are ( homoscedastic ) isotropic .",
    "carreira and williams conjectured in @xcite that if one is restricted to homoscedastic gaussian mixtures , then the maximum number of modes is actually @xmath0 , and verified this numerically for many examples in a brute force search . denoting by @xmath47 this maximum number , they asserted that @xmath48 for any @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 for all @xmath37 @xmath47    however , later j.j .",
    "duistermaat emailed them @xcite with a counterexample in @xmath51 with @xmath52 isotropic components , each on the vertex of an equilateral triangle .",
    "this configuration gives 4 modes for a small window of parameters , disproving the conjecture .",
    "consider the isotropic mixture with components @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there are three modes close to the original means and there is also a fourth mode at the origin .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : mixttriv ] , with the three means marked in blue and the four modes marked in red .        in terms of contribution to the study of the topography of gaussian mixture densities ,",
    "s. ray and b. lindsay initiate a systematic study and ask interesting questions in @xcite .",
    "they consider the _ ridgeline function _",
    "@xmath58 given by @xmath59^{-1}[\\alpha_1 \\sigma_1^{-1 } \\mu_1 + \\alpha_2 \\sigma_2^{-1 } \\mu_2 + \\ldots + \\alpha_k \\sigma_k^{-1 } \\mu_k]\\ ] ] and obtaining as its image the @xmath60-dimensional _ ridgeline manifold _ @xmath61 that contains all critical points of @xmath62 .",
    "this fact is useful , for example , in the case of homoscedastic mixtures , whose critical points ( and in particular all modes ) lie in the convex hull of the component means ( a result that appeared first in @xcite ) . in the conclusion of @xcite ,",
    "the following line appears : `` _ _ one might ask if there exists an upper bound for the number of modes , one that can be described as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 _ _ '' .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative for non - degenerate modes in section [ sec : five ] below .",
    "the appearance of a possible extra mode in dimension @xmath51 when having @xmath19 components carries over to higher dimensions . in @xcite , it was proven that @xmath63 .",
    "that is , one can get as many as @xmath64 modes from just a two component gaussian mixture in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "looking for further progress , ray proposed the maximum number of modes problem for the 2011 aim workshop on singular learning theory , organized by steele , sturmfels and watanabe @xcite .",
    "the problem was discussed yielding the following conjecture :    ( sturmfels , aim 2011 ) [ conjlab ] for all @xmath49 , @xmath65    this conjecture matches correctly all the known values for @xmath15 that we have presented so far . in the next section we will show that for @xmath51 there exist gaussian mixtures that achieve as many as @xmath66 modes , showing that ( [ boundaim ] ) is a lower bound on @xmath67 .        one could ask if there exists a counterexample to conjecture [ conjlab ] similar to duistermaat s for an isotropic mixture .",
    "specifically , let @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where we locate the @xmath68 modes coming from the deformation of 3 lines arranged in a equilateral triangle and means as the middle points on the 3 sides .",
    "each of the other 3 means lie near the corresponding triangle vertices .",
    "could an extra mode be formed at the origin for some values of the parameters ? this would give a total of 7 modes ( see figure [ fig : fakecounterex ] ) .",
    "note that by rotational symmetry , the origin is a critical point . if the gaussians are very concentrated on the lines ( see figure [ fig : notcounterex ] ) , then everything points at the origin being a local minimum , but if they diffuse enough , then it becomes a mode ( the problem is that we lose the other modes at the vertices ) .",
    "we argue that an intermediate scenario of a total of 7 modes is actually impossible .",
    "indeed , consider any height of the equilateral triangle .",
    "restricting the gaussian mixture density to that line , the components corresponding to the opposite sides project to the same kernel ; thus obtaining a combination of two gaussian kernels . since we know that the number of modes is at most two in this case , not all three of the critical points lying on the line can be modes .        in @xcite ,",
    "a construction of a finite configuration of isotropic gaussians with many modes is presented .",
    "one considers products of triangles , using the counterexample with @xmath69 modes of section  [ sec : two ] as the basic building block to obtain @xmath70 modes in dimension @xmath71 with @xmath72 components .",
    "this gives an example where the number of modes is superlinear @xmath73 in the number of components ( however , note that the dimension @xmath74 also grows with @xmath0 ) .",
    "in the following section , we provide configurations for any choice of @xmath1 and @xmath0 having @xmath75 modes .",
    "if we let @xmath1 grow logarithmically with @xmath0 as in  @xcite , we obtain superpolynomially ( but subexponentially ) many modes .",
    "in this section , we prove that gaussian mixtures can have many modes .    given @xmath76 , there is a mixture of @xmath0 gaussians in @xmath77 with at least @xmath75 modes .    for @xmath51",
    ", this agrees with . starting from a generic arrangement of @xmath0 hyperplanes in @xmath77",
    ", we are going to define a family @xmath78 of gauian mixtures depending on a parameter @xmath79 . around each of the @xmath80 intersection vertices @xmath81 of the arrangement",
    ", we construct neighborhoods @xmath82 , also depending on @xmath83 , so that for @xmath83 small enough , we have @xmath84 .",
    "this certifies the existence of a mode in @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , there will be a mode near each of the @xmath0 means .",
    "consider a generic arrangement @xmath86 of @xmath0 hyperplanes in @xmath77 .",
    "for each @xmath87 , denote by @xmath88 the orthogonal projection , and pick an affine map @xmath89 such that @xmath90 is the distance from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "further , choose means @xmath93 outside the other @xmath94 .",
    "then , our @xmath95th component will be a standard gauian with mean @xmath96 along @xmath92 with variance @xmath97 in the direction normal to @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath98 for the mixture , we take all coefficients to be equal : @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath81 be one of the intersection vertices ; without loss of generality , @xmath100 . for @xmath79",
    ", we define the neighborhood @xmath85 of @xmath81 to be @xmath101 ( note that @xmath102 ) .",
    "this is an affine cube with center @xmath81 .",
    "now we consider each of its @xmath103 facets @xmath104 , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 along @xmath104 , we have that @xmath107 at @xmath81 , we have @xmath108 .",
    "we have seen that , around the point @xmath81 , as @xmath109 , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the positive number @xmath112 adding up we get for @xmath113 that @xmath114 where @xmath115 . as",
    "the limit   is smaller ( by @xmath116 ) than the limit  , there must be some @xmath117 so that for @xmath118 we have @xmath119 .",
    "then the point @xmath120 where the continuous function @xmath121 takes it maximum over the compact set @xmath85 will be in the interior of @xmath85 , and hence is a local maximum .",
    "choosing @xmath122 to be the minimum over the @xmath123 over all intersection vertices @xmath81 , we obtain a mixture with at least @xmath80 modes .",
    "the argument for the existence of a mode near @xmath96 is similar , but much simpler .",
    "fix a compact neighborhood @xmath85 of @xmath96 which avoids the hyperplanes @xmath94 for @xmath124 . for small @xmath83 ,",
    "the @xmath125 for @xmath124 are negligible along @xmath85 .",
    "so the value of the mixture @xmath121 at @xmath96 will be bigger than the values along @xmath126 , because this is true for @xmath127 .",
    "now we present an upper bound using khovanskii s theory on fewnomials , see @xcite .",
    "explicitly ,    [ uppertheorem ] for all @xmath49 , the number of non - degenerate critical points for the density of a mixture of @xmath0 gaussians in @xmath77 is bounded by @xmath128    this will follow from a khovanskii - type theorem that bounds the number of nondegenerate solutions to a system of polynomial equations that includes transcendental functions",
    ". such a version where the transcendental functions are exponentials of linear forms was first presented by khovanskii to illustrate his theory of fewnomials [ @xcite , p.12 ] . in our case , however , we will be interested in exponentials of quadratic forms .",
    "[ upperthm ] for @xmath129 , let @xmath130 $ ] be polynomials of degree @xmath131 and for @xmath132 consider the exponential quadratic forms @xmath133 , with @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath136 are given by @xmath137 then the number of non - degenerate solutions to the system @xmath138 is finite and bounded by @xmath139    in order to prove the theorem , khovanskii gives first a sketch making simplifying assumptions ( and skipping technical details ) and fills the theory in his next two chapters .",
    "this sketch is also presented in @xcite and @xcite , and we will present the proof of our theorem in the same way . we will need the following lemma ( for a proof see e.g. theorem 4.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath140 be a smooth curve that intersects @xmath141 transversally , and @xmath142 a smooth nonvanishing tangential vector field to @xmath143 .",
    "then @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the number of points of @xmath143 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the number of unbounded components of @xmath143 .",
    "( of theorem [ upperthm ] ) by induction on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath148 , there are no exponentials and the bound reduces to the product of the degrees @xmath149 .",
    "this is the well known bzout bound for a multivariate system of polynomial equations .",
    "+ now we will give the sketch of the proof and mention how our estimates change if the assumptions in the induction step do not hold .",
    "in any case , the final inequalities needed to prove the bound will hold . + for @xmath150 , to reduce the number of exponentials to @xmath151 , we introduce a new variable @xmath152 such that the system with equations @xmath153 will have as solutions the ones from the original system when intersecting with the hyperplane @xmath154 .",
    "we assume the system defines a smooth curve @xmath143 in @xmath155 ( this is the critical step that needs to be modified later ) , so that we can apply the khovanskii - rolle lemma .",
    "indeed , a tangential vector field to @xmath143 is @xmath156 thus , the bound for @xmath145 is the number of solutions to the system in the @xmath157 variables @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath151 exponentials @xmath160 now , each @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a linear function .",
    "hence , @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath165 .",
    "thus @xmath166 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath167 , where @xmath168 . by induction hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath169 in order to bound @xmath147 , the number of unbounded components of @xmath143 , one observes that since each component has two infinite branches , there are ( counted with multiplicity ) @xmath170 accumulation points on the sphere @xmath171 , so a hyperplane sufficiently far from the origin will meet @xmath143 in at least @xmath147 points . in other words , a hyperplane can be chosen so that @xmath147 can be bounded by the number of solutions of a system @xmath172 for some @xmath173 . under non - degeneracy of the solutions ,",
    "we get by induction hypothesis , @xmath174 so , in total , @xmath175 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{2 } } \\\\ & < &   d_1 \\cdots d_n \\left [ ( n+d)(5 + n + d)^{k-1 } \\cdot   2^{k-1 } +    5(5 + n + d)^{k-1 } \\cdot 2^{k-1 } \\right ] \\cdot 2^{\\frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{2 } } \\\\ & = & d_1 \\cdots d_n ( 5+n+d)^k \\cdot 2^{\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] as we wanted .",
    "this is the end of the sketch .    if the smoothness assumptions for the system after introducing @xmath152 are not satisfied , the argument is modified via the morse - sard theorem .",
    "the details of such modifications can be found along @xcite , although we find that for our theorem these are better summarized in [ @xcite , p. 293",
    "essentially , one slightly perturbs the system from @xmath176 to @xmath177 ( @xmath178 in a neighborhood of @xmath26 ) to guarantee obtaining a smooth curve @xmath143 .",
    "the asserted bound remains unchanged , and the number of non - degenerate solutions of the perturbed system can not be less than the number for the original system .",
    "another change is that since the polynomial system might not define a proper map , one adds an extra variable @xmath179 with an extra equation @xmath180 with @xmath181 so that every preimage is now bounded .",
    "morse - sard now applies to conclude the set of regular values of @xmath182 is open and dense .",
    "the number of non - degenerate solutions of the new system has twice the number of non - degenerate solutions of the original system that lie in the open ball of radius @xmath183 centered at the origin . in terms of the bounding of the corresponding @xmath184",
    ", we now have @xmath185 ( the extra 2 comes from the degree of [ extraeq ] , and we now have @xmath186 variables ) . for @xmath187 , @xmath188 ( the extra 1 from the hyperplane equation ) .",
    "since the @xmath181 does not affect the bound computation , it can be taken large enough to include all the solutions to the original system .",
    "thus @xmath189 is a bound for twice as many non - degenerate solutions of said original system . finally , this way the induction step inequality",
    "can again be completed @xmath190 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{2 } } \\\\ & < &   d_1 \\cdots d_n \\left [ ( 1+n+d)(5 + n + d)^{k-1 } \\cdot   2^{k-1 } + 4(5 + n + d)^{k-1 } \\cdot 2^{k-1 } \\right ] \\cdot 2^{\\frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{2 } } \\\\ & = & d_1 \\cdots d_n ( 5+n+d)^k \\cdot 2^{\\frac{k(k-1)}{2 } } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] as needed .",
    "now we can obtain theorem [ uppertheorem ] as a corollary of the above .",
    "( of theorem [ uppertheorem ] ) let @xmath191 be a gaussian mixture and consider the system @xmath192 given by the partial derivatives @xmath193 .",
    "these can be interpreted as polynomials @xmath194 by taking @xmath195 as the exponential kernel of @xmath196 .",
    "the system now has the form as in theorem [ upperthm ] , and note that the degree of each @xmath197 is @xmath24 .",
    "the number of non - degenerate critical points of @xmath62 is thus the number of non - degenerate solutions to the system of @xmath198 , and according to ( [ fewbound ] ) , it is bounded by @xmath199",
    "one of the motivations to study critical points of gaussian mixtures comes from the _ mean shift algorithm_. it converges if there are only finitely many critical points .",
    "this was the main goal sought in @xcite for gaussian kernels .",
    "as our bound only bounds the number of non - degenerate critical points of gaussian mixtures , a final answer is still open .",
    "non - degenerate critical points are isolated . because the set of critical points of a gaussian mixture is closed and bounded , it is finite if and only if it consists of isolated points ( compare  @xcite ) .",
    "quantitatively , we do not expect our upper bound to be tight .",
    "rather , proving the lower bound @xmath200 for all @xmath37 will be the main focus of a forthcoming paper , extending the technique used to prove the case @xmath51 presented here .",
    "we observe that our lower bounds can be extended to all elliptical distributions , not only gaussians .",
    "a study of the number of modes for mixtures of elliptical distributions , including @xmath152-distributions , is done in @xcite .",
    "this is done by extending the concept of the ridgeline manifold to these distributions ( upper bounds are @xmath24 or @xmath201 modes for a mixture of two @xmath152-distributions with equal dispersion matrices or same degrees of freedom ) .",
