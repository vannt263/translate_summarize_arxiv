    "quantum - dots can be viewed as artificially structured atoms in heterojunctions or metal - oxide - semiconductor devices where few electrons are confined to a length comparable to the mesoscopic effective bohr radius @xmath0 ( @xmath1 @xmath2 m in the case of gaas ) . though the confinement can _ a priori _ occur in all three directions , some types of experimentally realized quantum - dots display an extension in the @xmath3 plane which is much larger than in the growth direction @xmath4 of the underlying semiconductor structure.@xcite therefore , these quantum - dots are usually regarded as artificial atoms with a disk - like shape . since electron numbers @xmath5 as low as one or two per dot have already been realized,@xcite quantum - dot helium consisting of two electrons trapped in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) axisymmetrical harmonic potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the effective electron mass , is actually considered as the simplest realistic model for an interacting quantum system.@xcite as itself or amongst other such few - electron systems , it has been extensively studied in the relationship with the development of nanotechnologies.@xcite both its exact 2d-3d analytical@xcite or 2d numerical@xcite solutions in the presence of a perpendicular homogeneous external magnetic field are known , in particular by use of the separation of the hamiltonian into its center - of - mass and relative - motion terms , due to the assumption of a parabolic particle confinement .",
    "oscillations between spin - singlet and spin - triplet ground states as a function of the magnetic field strength have been predicted@xcite and experimentally observed.@xcite they are due to the interplay between the dot size and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "another important competition occurs between the kinetic - energy matrix elements and the electron - electron coulomb interaction ones when changing the characteristic length @xmath9 of the quantum dot without changing its shape .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath9 , the coulomb interaction becomes negligible and the electrons behave like independent , uncorrelated particles.@xcite this happens in particular in the case of strong parabolic confinement @xmath10 since then @xmath11 .    in this rich theoretical and experimental context ,",
    "we wish to emphasize new physical results by use of a quite original  with respect to the above state of the art ",

    "the problem with such eigenstates is that , being the ( stationary ) solutions of the sp nonlinear differential system , they are orthogonal .",
    "the whole matrix machinery of quantum mechanics then fails and we are left to return to its _ ab - initio _ fundamental principles . in particular , the square scalar product @xmath12 of two such nonlinear eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath14 defines the probability to find the system in either state when it is known to be in the other one ( this probability is of course zero for orthogonal hilbertian eigenstates ) .",

    "the present paper is built as follows .",

    "we find an interference - like pattern @xmath26 .",
    "then we validate the above results both by stressing the link between @xmath27 and fermi s golden rule for small nonlinearity @xmath28 , as well as by displaying the transition of the system to the asymptotic semi - classical thomas - fermi regime for high values of the nonlinearity @xmath29 . finally , we test the reliability of the present sp description of quantum - dot helium by comparison with the existing numerical ( refs ( ) & ( ): respectively figs [ fig01 ] , [ fig03 ] , and [ fig05 ] ) and analytical ( ref .",
