    "<S> we use supersymmetry transformations to design transparent and one - way reflectionless ( thus unidirectionally invisible ) complex optical crystals with balanced gain and loss profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering co - efficients are investigated using the transfer matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the amount of reflection from the left can be made arbitrarily close to zero whereas the reflection from the right is enhanced arbitrarily ( or vice versa ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we see an object because light bounces off it . if this scattering of light could be cloaked and if the object does not absorb any light then it would become invisible . </S>",
    "<S> although _ invisibility _ has been a subject of science fiction for millennia , the recent discovery of metamaterials is opening up the possibility of practical demonstrations of cloaking devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a properly designed metamaterial shell surrounded around a given object can drastically conceal its scattering for any angle of incidence , making it almost undetectable . </S>",
    "<S> different techniques like the coordinate transformation technique@xcite , and the scattering cancellation technique @xcite , are suggested to design cloaking from electromagnetic waves . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of a coordinate transformation cloak , which is able to hide a copper cylinder at microwave frequency , has been recently reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of cloaking has also been extended to the quantum and acoustic domains , realizing matter - wave @xcite and acoustic cloaks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , cloaking in visible light , hiding more complex shapes and materials , still remains distant .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , it has been discovered @xcite that light propagation can also be influenced substantially by controlling the parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry in such a way that amplification and loss balance each other . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , as opposed to wrapping a scatterer with a cloak , @xmath0-symmetric material can become one - way invisible as a result of spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> such unidirectional invisibility has been predicted @xcite by bragg scattering in sinusoidal complex crystal of finite length : @xmath1 near its symmetry breaking point @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a ray of light when it hits one side of such a material is transmitted completely without any reflection . in this same regime </S>",
    "<S> the transmission phase also vanishes , which is compulsory for avoiding detectability . </S>",
    "<S> when the transmittance and ( left , right ) reflectance are analytically expressed @xcite in terms of the modified bessel functions , it becomes clear on closer inspection that there is , however , a very small deviation of left reflectance from @xmath3 ( varies rapidly on the scale of @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission is also not perfect in amplitude or phase . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the unidirectional invisibility is ambiguous for a crystal with length @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at the @xmath0-symmetry breaking point the sinusoidal crystal appears to be one - way invisible solely for a shallow grating which indeed is realized by recent experiments on a @xmath0-synthetic photonic lattice @xcite .    on the other hand , _ nonrelativistic </S>",
    "<S> _ supersymmetry ( susy ) transformations are shown @xcite to be useful in the framework of optics to synthesize new optical structures . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , susy has provided a method to generate an optical medium with defects that can not be detected by an outside observer @xcite , to obtain transparent interface separating two isospectral but different crystals @xcite , and to create a family of isospectral potentials to optimize quantum cascade lasers @xcite . in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> susy has been used to generate a complex optical potential with real spectra , even their shape violate @xmath0-symmetry . further , susy photonic lattices @xcite are used to design lossless integrated mode filtering arrangements .    </S>",
    "<S> our purpose here is to use susy transformations of the sinusoidal complex crystal at its symmetry breaking point to design one - way invisible crystals with sophisticated shape and structure . the scattering co - efficients for these crystals are investigated using the transfer matrix approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precisely , we have derived the relationship between the transfer matrices of the initial crystal @xmath7 and its @xmath8th order isospectral crystals @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals that the corresponding transmission coefficients do not alter their values , whereas the values of left and right reflection coefficients do . </S>",
    "<S> the left ( right ) reflectivity can be diminished ( enhanced ) arbitrarily using higher order susy transformations . </S>",
    "<S> for instance the magnitude of left reflection ( for @xmath5 ) is reducible from @xmath4 to @xmath10 after two transformations .    _ construction of isospectral crystals : _ we consider a @xmath0-symmetric relative dielectric constant @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the complex refractive index whose imaginary part represents either gain or loss . the variation in @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> is measured along the longitudinal @xmath14 direction in @xmath15 . in this </S>",
    "<S> setting , a time - harmonic electric field of frequency @xmath16 obeys the scalar helmholtz equation @xcite , which is formally identical to the time - independent schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath17 : @xmath18 provided @xmath19 and @xmath16 is very close to the bragg frequency @xmath20 the @xmath0-symmetry of the refractive index translates into the potential such that @xmath21 it is the following potential that we wish to consider here as a reference potential to construct isospectral crystals : @xmath22 in addition , later in the context of scattering we will consider @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral problem for this potential is well - studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of @xmath26 is the semi - infinite real axis and there is no band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the equation ( [ e1 ] ) can readily be reduced to the bessel modified differential equation after changing of variable @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> hence for a non integer @xmath30 the most general solutions can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the modified bessel function of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> moreover for the crystal momentum @xmath33 we have @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath35 is a bloch wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the potential and corresponding reduced zone band structure are shown in figures [ f1](a ) and [ f1](d ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we consider two periodic potentials @xmath7 @xmath36 and @xmath37 describing two crystals with different unit cells but with the same lattice period , i.e. @xmath38 but @xmath39 . then these two crystals are said to be isospectral if they have an identical energy band structure . </S>",
    "<S> like the hermitian case @xcite , susy transformations also enable @xcite one to easily construct a new complex periodic potential @xmath37 , which is isospectral and @xmath37 are related by simple translation , @xmath40 or inversion @xmath41 ) ] to @xmath7 . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> , the hamiltonian @xmath42 is written in factored form @xmath43 with the help of following two first order linear operators @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy of factorization and the superpotential @xmath46 is defined in terms of bloch solution : @xmath47 consequently , @xmath7 can be expressed as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> note here that for a @xmath0-symmetric complex @xmath7 , @xmath49 is complex and @xmath50 . to @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> there corresponds the partner hamiltonian @xmath51 with @xmath52 for a periodic and exact @xmath0-symmetric potential @xmath7 , the bloch wave function @xmath53 implies that the superpotential @xmath49 is periodic and anti-@xmath0-symmetric i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> hence eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e22 ] ) clearly shows that @xmath37 respects the condition of periodicity and @xmath0-symmetry . for periodic systems , the two zero modes ( which are the solutions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively ) @xmath58 will belong to the hilbert space </S>",
    "<S> if they satisfy the bloch condition mentioned earlier . now using the periodicity condition @xmath54 in equation ( [ e100 ] ) we have @xmath59 clearly , @xmath60 will be bloch wave functions if @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words for periodic case the susy is said to be unbroken if @xmath62 , otherwise it is broken . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the two zero modes @xmath60 either both are bloch functions ( in which case susy is unbroken ) , or neither of them are bloch functions ( when @xmath63 and susy is broken ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the periodic case , irrespective of whether susy is broken or unbroken , the potentials @xmath64 are always strictly isospectral . for @xmath0-symmetric complex potentials , </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential is anti-@xmath0-symmetric i.e. the real part of @xmath46 is an odd function . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the real part of the integral in eq.([e101 ] ) is always equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus for @xmath0-symmetric periodic systems the susy is always unbroken and the energy spectra are strictly identical . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry also allows one to connect the solutions of @xmath65 to those of @xmath42 via the relation @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , if @xmath67 is a bloch wave function , then so is @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above technique can be applied to obtain another new hamiltonian @xmath69 isospectral to @xmath65 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . here </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath72 has the same form as in equation ( [ e10 ] ) but with different superpotential @xmath73 , where the factorization function @xmath74 and energy of factorization @xmath75 @xmath76 satisfy @xmath77 . </S>",

    "<S> this difficulty can be overcome by writing the expressions another way in terms of the solutions of the initial reference hamiltonian only . since </S>",
    "<S> all the solutions @xmath93 of @xmath94 are related to the solution @xmath95 of @xmath42 by the relation ( [ e5 ] ) , after a cumbersome but straight forward calculations we can rewrite    @xmath96'}{w[u_0, ... ,u_{n-1 } ] } , \\quad \\quad   n=1,2 ... \\label{e6a}\\ ] ]    @xmath97'}{w[u_0, ... ,u_{n-1}]}\\right)'\\label{e6b}\\ ] ]    @xmath98 ~ \\left(w[u_0, ... ,u_{n-1}]\\right)^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 $ ] is the wronskian determinant with @xmath100 = u_0 $ ] so that @xmath101 . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the first order isospectral crystal reduces to the following simple functional form @xmath105 for illustration , we have plotted the real and imaginary parts of the two isospectral crystals @xmath106 in figure [ f1](b ) , and [ f1](c ) , respectively . </S>",
