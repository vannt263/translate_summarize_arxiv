    "in many multiple hypothesis testing problems arising in modern scientific investigations , the hypotheses appear in non - overlapping blocks .",
    "such block formation is often a natural phenomenon due to the underlying experimental process or can be created based on other considerations .",
    "for instance , the hypotheses corresponding to ( i ) the different time - points in a microarray time - course experiment ( guo , sarkar and peddada , 2010 ; sun and wei , 2011 ) for each gene ; or ( ii ) the phenotypes ( or the genetic models ) with ( or using ) which each marker is tested in a genome - wide association study ( lei et al . , 2006 ) ; or ( iii ) the conditions ( or subjects ) considered for each voxel in brain imaging ( heller et al . 2007 ) , naturally form a block . while applying multiple testing in astronomical transient source detection from nightly telescopic image consisting of large number of pixels ( each corresponding to a hypotheses ) , clements , sarkar and guo ( 2012 ) considered grouping the pixels into blocks of equal size based on telescope ` point spread function . '    a special type of dependence , which we call block dependence , is the relevant dependence structure that one should take into account while constructing multiple testing procedures in presence of such blocks .",
    "this dependence can be simply described by saying that the hypotheses or the corresponding @xmath0-values are mostly dependent within but not between blocks .",
    "also known as the clumpy dependence ( storey , 2003 ) , this has been considered mainly in simulation studies to investigate how multiple testing procedures proposed under independence continue to perform under it ( benjamini , krieger and yekutieli , 2006 ; finner , dickhaus , and roters , 2007 ; sarkar , guo and finner , 2012 , and storey , taylor and siegmund , 2004 ) , not in offering fdr or fwer controlling procedures precisely utilizing it . in this article , we focus on constructing procedures controlling the fdr and the fwer that incorporate the block dependence in a non - asymptotic setting in an attempt to improve the corresponding procedures that ignore this structure .",
    "more specifically , we consider the benjamini - hochberg ( bh , 1995 ) method for the fdr control and the bonferroni method for the fwer control and adapt them to the data in two ways - incorporating the block dependence and estimating the number of true null hypotheses capturing such dependence .    adapting to unknown number of true nulls has been a popular way to improve the fdr and fwer controls of the bh and bonferroni methods , respectively .",
    "however , construction of such adaptive methods with proven control of the ultimate fdr or fwer in a non - asymptotic setting and providing real improvements under dependence is an open problem ( benjamini , krieger and yekutieli , 2006 ; blanchard and roquaine , 2009 ) .",
    "we offer some solutions to this open problem in this paper under a commonly encountered type of dependence , the block dependence .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath3 , are the @xmath4 null hypotheses appearing in @xmath5 blocks of size @xmath6 for the @xmath7th block that are to be simultaneously tested based on their respective @xmath0-values @xmath8 , @xmath2 ; @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 of these null hypotheses be true , which for notational convenience will often be identified by @xmath11 s .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 and make the following assumption regarding dependence of @xmath8 s :    ( block dependence ) _ the rows of @xmath0-values @xmath13 , @xmath14 , forming the @xmath5 blocks are independent of each other . _    under this assumption , the null @xmath0-values are independent between but not within blocks . regarding dependence within blocks , our assumption will depend on whether we want to control the fdr or fwer .",
    "more specifically , we develop methods adapting to this block dependence structure and controlling the fdr under positive dependence of the @xmath0-values within each block or the fwer under arbitrary dependence of the @xmath0-values within each block .",
    "the positive dependence condition , when assumed for each @xmath7 , will be of the type characterized by the following : @xmath15 for each @xmath16 and any ( coordinatewise ) non - decreasing function @xmath17 .",
    "this type of positive dependence is commonly encountered and used in multiple testing ; see , for instance , sarkar ( 2008 ) for references .",
    "we will sometimes refer to block dependence more specifically as _ positive block dependence _ in case when this dependence defined by ( 1 ) in each block or as _ arbitrary block dependence _ in case of any dependence within each block , to avoid any apparent double meaning .",
    "we will be using two types of multiple testing procedure in this paper - stepup and single - step .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , be the pairs of @xmath0-value and the corresponding null hypothesis , and @xmath20 be the ordered @xmath0-values .",
    "given a set of critical constants @xmath21 , a stepup test rejects @xmath22 for all @xmath7 such that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , provided this maximum exists , otherwise , it accepts all the null hypotheses .",
    "a single - step test rejects @xmath22 if @xmath25 for some constant @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of falsely rejected among all the @xmath28 rejected null hypotheses in a multiple testing procedure .",
    "then , the fdr or fwer of this procedure , defined respectively by fdr = @xmath29 or fwer = @xmath30 , is said to be controlled at level @xmath31 , strongly unless stated otherwise , if it is bounded above by @xmath31 .",
    "that is , for for any configuration of true and false null hypotheses , the fdr or fwer of this procedure is less than or equal to @xmath31 .",
    "the bh method controlling the fdr at level @xmath31 is a stepup test with the critical constants @xmath32 ; whereas , the bonferroni method controlling the fwer at level @xmath31 is a single - step test with the critical constant @xmath33 .",
    "the method we propose in this section is based on the idea of adapting the bh method to the block dependence structure without losing the ultimate control over the fdr in a non - asymptotic setting .",
    "our adaptation is done in two steps .",
    "first , we adjust it to the block dependence structure and then develop its oracle version given the number of true nulls .",
    "second , we consider the data - adaptive version of this oracle method by estimating @xmath10 using an estimate that also captures the block dependence .    towards adjusting the bh method to the block structure",
    ", we note that it is natural to first identify blocks that are significant by applying the bh method to simultaneously test the intersection null hypotheses @xmath34 , @xmath35 , based on some block specific @xmath0-values , and then go back to each significant block to see which hypotheses in that block are significant .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath2 , be the block @xmath0-values obtained by combining the @xmath0-values in each block through a combination function . regarding the choice of this combination function",
    ", we note that the combination test for @xmath37 based on @xmath36 must allow simultaneous testing of the individual hypotheses @xmath1 , @xmath3 , with a strong control of the fwer .",
    "this limits our choice to the bonferroni adjusted minimum @xmath0-value ; see also guo , sarkar and peddada ( 2010 ) . with these in mind ,",
    "we consider adjusting the bh method as follows :    _ ( two - stage bh under block dependence ) _",
    "* _ 1 . choose @xmath38 as the @xmath7th block @xmath0-value , for @xmath2 , with @xmath39 being the average block size .",
    "_ * _ 2 . order the block @xmath0-values as @xmath40 , and find @xmath41 .",
    "* _ 3 . reject @xmath1 for all @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , provided the above maximum exists , otherwise , accept all the null hypotheses .",
    "_    the number of false rejections in this two - stage bh method is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 or @xmath47 according to whether it is true or false .",
    "so , with @xmath28 as the total number of rejections , the fdr of this method under block dependence is @xmath48 since @xmath49 . for each @xmath42 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of significant blocks detected by the adjusted bh method based on @xmath52 , the @xmath53 block @xmath0-values other than the @xmath36 , and the critical values @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "taking expectation in ( 3 ) under the block dependence and applying it to ( 2 ) , we see that @xmath56 where @xmath57 . thus , we have the following result holds :    result 1 . _",
    "the above defined two - stage bh method strongly controls the fdr at @xmath31 under assumption 1 of arbitrary block dependence . _",
    "if @xmath10 , and hence @xmath58 , were known , the fdr control of this two - stage bh method could be made tighter , from @xmath59 to @xmath31 , by shrinking each @xmath0-value from @xmath8 to @xmath60",
    ". this would be the oracle form of the adjusted bh method . since @xmath58 is unknown",
    ", one would consider using @xmath61 to estimate @xmath58 from the available @xmath0-values and then use the estimate @xmath61 to define the so - called shrunken or adaptive @xmath0-values @xmath62 to be used in place of the original @xmath0-values in the adjusted bh method .",
    "this will be our proposed adaptive bh method .    for estimating @xmath10 capturing the block dependence structure before defining the adaptive @xmath0-values , we consider using an estimate of the form @xmath63 that satisfies the following property . in this property , @xmath64 denotes the set of @xmath0-values and @xmath65 .",
    "we are now ready to define our proposed adaptive bh method in the following :    _ ( adaptive bh under block dependence ) _    * _ 1 .",
    "consider an estimate @xmath66 satisfying property 1 and define the adaptive @xmath0-values @xmath67 using @xmath68 .",
    "* _ 2 . find @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "* _ 3 . reject @xmath1 for all @xmath42 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , provided the maximum in step 2 exists , otherwise , accept all the null hypotheses . _",
    "consider the block dependence structure in which the @xmath0-values are positively dependent as in ( 1 ) within each block .",
    "the fdr of the above adaptive bh method is controlled at @xmath31 under such positive block dependence .    a proof of this theorem will be given in appendix .    what is exactly an estimate satisfying property 1 that one can use in this adaptive bh ?",
    "the following result , which is again going to be proved in appendix , provides an answer to this question .",
    "_ consider the estimate @xmath73 for any @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the number of @xmath0-values in @xmath77 not exceeding @xmath78 .",
    "it satisfies property 1 under assumption 1 . _",
    "based on theorem 1 and result 2 , we have the following result .",
    "result 3 . _ the adaptive bh method of the above type based on the estimates @xmath79 with @xmath80 strongly controls the fdr at @xmath31 under the positive block dependence considered in theorem 1 . _",
    "when @xmath81 , the estimate @xmath79 reduces to @xmath82 the storey at al.s ( 2004 ) estimate , considered in the context of adaptive fdr control ( by benjamini , krieger and yekutieli , 2006 ; blanchard and roquain , 2009 ; sarkar , 2008 and storey , taylor and siegmund , 2004 ) without any block structure .",
    "of course , result 1 holds for any @xmath83 when @xmath81 .",
    "also , in this case , we are basically assuming that the @xmath0-values are independent .",
    "thus , as a special case , result 3 provides the following known result available in the aforementioned papers :    note 1 .",
    "_ the adaptive bh method in definition 2 based on the estimate @xmath84 controls the fdr at @xmath31 under independence of the @xmath0-values .",
    "_    blanchard and roquain ( 2009 ) presented an adaptive bh method that continues to control the fdr under the same dependence assumption of the @xmath0-values as made for the original bh method .",
    "their idea is to estimate @xmath10 independently through an fwer controlling method before incorporating that into the original bh method .",
    "while this adaptive bh method would be applicable to our present context , it does not capture the group structure of the data .",
    "moreover , their simulation studies only show an improvement of their adaptive bh method over the original bh method in very limited situations .",
    "hu , zhao and zhou ( 2010 ) considered adjusting the bh method in presence of group structure by weighting the @xmath0-values according to the relative importance of each group before proposing its adaptive version by estimating these weights .",
    "however , this version of the adaptive bh method is known to control the fdr only in an asymptotic setting and under weak dependence .",
    "our proposed method here is based on the idea of adapting the bonferroni method to the block dependence structure with ultimate control of the fwer in a non - asymptotic setting .",
    "given an estimate @xmath85 of @xmath10 obtained from the available @xmath0-values , the bonferroni method can be adapted to the data through @xmath85 by rejecting @xmath1 if @xmath86 ; see , for instance , finner and gontscharuk ( 2009 ) and guo ( 2009 ) .",
    "our method is such an adaptive version of the bonferroni method , but based on an estimate of @xmath10 satisfying property 1 that captures the block dependence .    _",

    "the fwer of the above adaptive bonferroni method is controlled at @xmath31 under such arbitrary block dependence .",
    "this will be proved in appendix .",
    "based on theorem 2 and result 2 , we have the following result .",
    "result 4 . _ the adaptive bonferroni method of the above type based on the estimates @xmath79 with @xmath88 strongly controls the fwer at @xmath31 under the arbitrary block dependence considered in theorem 2 . _",
    "similar to what we have said in remark 1 on adaptive fdr control , the storey at al.s ( 2004 ) estimate @xmath89 corresponding to the case @xmath81 was also considered in the context of adaptive fwer control ( by finner and gontscharuk , 2009 , guo , 2009 , and sarkar , guo and finner , 2012 ) , of course without any block structure .",
    "thus , as a special case of result 4 , we get the following result derived in these papers :    note 2 . _ the adaptive bonferroni method in definition 3 based on the estimate @xmath84 controls the fwer at @xmath31 under independence of the @xmath0-values . _",
    "we performed simulation studies to investigate the following questions :    * how does the newly suggested adaptive bh method based on the estimate @xmath79 perform in terms of the fdr control and power with respect to the block size @xmath90 , the parameter @xmath78 , and the strength of dependence among the @xmath0-values compared to the original bh method and the two existing adaptive bh methods in storey et al .",

    "we then applied each method to the generated data to test @xmath98 against @xmath99 simultaneously for @xmath100 , at level @xmath101 .",
    "we repeated the above two steps @xmath102 times .    in the simulations on adaptive bh methods , we set @xmath103 or @xmath104 and @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 block dependent normal random variables @xmath108 , are generated and grouped into @xmath109 or @xmath110 blocks .",

    "the following are the observations from the above simulations :    _ from figure 1 and 2 _ : the simulated fdrs and average powers for the three adaptive bh methods remain unchanged with increasing @xmath97 for different values of @xmath90 and @xmath78 . for small @xmath90 and different @xmath78 ,",

[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    _ from figure 3 and 4 _ : when @xmath90 and @xmath78 are both small , both adaptive bonferroni methods slightly lose the control over the fwer for most values of @xmath97 ; however , when @xmath78 is chosen to be large , the fwer of the new adaptive method is controlled at @xmath31 with increasing @xmath97 , whereas the existing adaptive method still loses control of the fwer . when @xmath90 is moderate or large ,",
    "the new adaptive method maintains a control over the fwer whatever be the @xmath97 , whereas the existing adaptive method can lose control over the fwer for some values of @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , comparing the power performances of the two adaptive methods along with their fwer control , it is clear that the new method is a better choice as an adaptive version of the bonferroni method under block dependence than the existing one when @xmath90 is not very large .",
    "however , when @xmath90 is very large , the new method loses its edge over the existing one .",
    "construction of adaptive multiple testing methods with proven control of the ultimate fdr or fwer under dependence in non - asymptotic setting is an open problem . in this paper , we have offered a solution to this open problem under a commonly assumed form of dependence , the block dependence .",
    "we have developed new adaptive bh method with proven fdr control under positive block dependence and new adaptive bonferroni method with proven fwer control under arbitrary block dependence .",
    "they often provide real improvements over the corresponding conventional bh and bonferroni methods .",
    "the type of block dependence structure we consider here is often seen in real applications .",
    "it perfectly fits in genetic research where the locations are independent on different chromosomes but dependent inside the same chromosome .",
    "it also arises in the context of simultaneous testing of multiple families of hypotheses , which is often considered in large scale data analysis in modern scientific investigations , such as dna microarray and fmri studies .",
    "each family of null hypotheses here can be interpreted as a block .",
    "benjamini and bogomolov ( 2014 ) recently discussed a related problem of testing multiple families of hypotheses and developed a related procedure : use the bh procedure across families , and then use the bonferroni procedure within the selected families , with the @xmath122 adjustment , where @xmath123 is the number of the selected families and @xmath5 is the number of the tested families .",
    "however , in the aforementioned paper , the objective is to control a general average error rate over the selected families including average fdr and fwer instead of the overall fdr and fwer , which is different from ours . also , there is no explicit discussions of adaptive procedures in that paper as in the methods suggested in this paper",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the connection between the theory and methods developed in this paper and those in aforementioned paper .",
