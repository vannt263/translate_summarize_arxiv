    "certain elements ",
    "si and fe being prime examples  are often extremely _ depleted _ from the interstellar gas ( jenkins 2003 ) .",
    "the explanation for this depletion is that the atoms that are `` missing '' from the gas phase are located in solid particles ",
    "interstellar dust grains .",
    "the existence of this solid phase complicates efforts to determine elemental abundances , due to the difficult - to - determine abundance in grains .",
    "the concentration of certain elements in dust grains also creates the possibility of selective transport of those elements through the gas , which could , at least in principle , lead to variations in elemental abundances from point to point in the interstellar medium , and possibly even differences between stellar and interstellar abundances .",
    "dust grains might even deplete deuterium from the gas , providing an alternative explanation for observed variations in d / h ratios .",
    "observations of interstellar dust were recently reviewed by whittet ( 2003 ) and draine ( 2003a ) .",
    "the astrophysics of interstellar dust is a broad subject , encompassing dust grain formation and destruction , charging of dust grains , heating of interstellar gas by photoelectrons from dust , electron transfer from dust grains to metal ions , the optics of interstellar dust , optical luminescence and infrared emission from dust , chemistry on dust grains , and the dynamics of dust grains , including radiation - driven drift of grains relative to gas , and alignment of dust by the magnetic field .",
    "introductions to the astrophysics of dust can be found in krgel ( 2003 ) and draine ( 2004 ) .",
    "genuine interstellar grains are found in meteorites ( clayton & nittler 2003 ) , but , because present search techniques rely on isotopic anomalies , the grains that are found are limited to those formed in stellar winds or ejecta .",
    "theoretical studies of grain destruction by supernova - driven blastwaves lead to estimated grain lifetimes of only @xmath1 ( draine & salpeter 1979 ; jones et al . 1994 ) ; this , together with the large depletions typically seen for elements like si implies , that the bulk of interstellar grain material must be regrown in the interstellar medium ( draine & salpeter 1979 , draine 1990 ) .",
    "our knowledge of interstellar dust is largely derived from the interaction of dust particles with electromagnetic radiation : attenuation of starlight , scattering of light , and emission of infrared and far - infrared radiation .",
    "the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction tells us about both the size and composition of the grains .",
    "the extinction is best determined using the `` pair method ''  comparison of the fluxes from two stars with nearly - identical spectroscopic features ( and therefore photospheric temperature and gravity ) but with one of the stars nearly unaffected by dust . with the assumption that the extinction goes to zero as wavelength @xmath2 ,",
    "it is possible to determine the extinction @xmath3 as a function of wavelength ( see , e.g. , fitzpatrick & massa 1990 , and references therein ) .",
    "the extinction @xmath3 is obviously proportional to the amount of dust , but @xmath4 , the extinction normalized to some reference wavelength @xmath5 , characterizes the _ kind _ of dust present , and its size distribution .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 characterizes the slope of the extinction curve between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; small values of @xmath9 correspond to steep extinction curves .",
    "values ranging from 2.1 to 5.5 , using the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) parameterization , plus diffuse interstellar bands following jenniskens & desert ( 1994 ) . also shown is an improved fit to the extinction curve toward hd21021 , providing one example of how a sightline can deviate from the average behavior for the same value of @xmath9.,width=302 ]    in principle , the function @xmath10 is unique to every sightline , but cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) found that the observed @xmath10 can be approximated by a one - parameter family of curves : @xmath11 , where they chose @xmath6 as the parameter because it varies significantly from one curve to another .",
    "cardelli et al .",
    "obtained functional forms for @xmath12 which provided a good fit to observational data ; fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) revisited this question and , explicitly correcting for the finite width of photometric bands , obtained a slightly revised set of fitting functions .",
    "figure [ fig : alambda_over_ai ] shows the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) fitting functions , using @xmath13 , the central wavelength of the cousins i band , as the reference wavelength .",
    "the parameterization is shown for values of @xmath9 ranging from 2.1 to 5.5 , which spans the range of @xmath9 values encountered on sightlines through diffuse clouds in the milky way .",
    "also shown is an empirical fit to the extinction measured toward hd210121 , showing how an individual sightline can deviate from the one - parameter fitting function @xmath12 .",
    "dust on sightlines with different values of @xmath9 obviously must have either different compositions or different size distributions , or both .",
    "also of interest is the total amount of dust per unit h. this requires measurement of the total h column density @xmath14 .",
    "on most sightlines the ionized hydrogen is a small correction ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be measured using ultraviolet absorption lines .",
    "rachford et al .  (",
    "2002 ) determined @xmath17 to an estimated accuracy of better than a factor 1.5 on 14 sightlines .",
    "it appears that @xmath18 is positively correlated with @xmath9 , with @xmath19 \\times10^{-22}{\\rm cm}^2 \\label{eq : a_i / n_h}\\ ] ] providing an empirical fit ( draine 2003a ) .",
    "we can use the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) parameterization and equation ( [ eq : a_i / n_h ] ) to estimate @xmath20 for sightlines with different @xmath9 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : alambda_over_nh ]  sightlines with larger @xmath9 values appear to have larger values of @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and decreased values for @xmath22 .",
    "this is interpreted as resulting from coagulation of a fraction of the smallest grains onto the larger grains ; loss of small grains decreases the ultraviolet extinction , while adding mass to the larger grains increases the scattering at @xmath23 .",
    "interstellar dust glows in the infrared , with a significant fraction of the power radiated at @xmath24 . in reflection",
    "nebulae the surface brightness is often high enough to permit spectroscopy of the emission ; the 515@xmath25 spectrum of ngc 7023 is shown in figure [ fig : pah ] .",
    "the spectrum has 5 very conspicuous emission peaks , at @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; there is an additional emission peak at @xmath28 ( not shown here ) , as well as weaker peaks at 12.0 and 13.6@xmath25 .",
    "these emission features are in striking agreement with the wavelengths of the major optically - active vibrational modes for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules : the 515@xmath25 features are labelled in figure [ fig : pah ] ; the 3.3@xmath25 feature ( not shown ) is the c - h stretching mode . the vibrational excitation results from single - photon heating ( see  [ sec : ir+fir_emission ] ) . the strength of the observed emission requires that pah molecules be a major component of interstellar dust .",
    "modeling the observed emission in reflection nebulae indicates that the pah species containing @xmath29 c atoms contain @xmath3040  ppm c / h  approximately 15% of @xmath31  ppm ( allende prieto et al 2002 ) .",

    "1996 ) , and four pah molecules , with examples of mono , duo , trio , and quartet h sites indicated.,title=\"fig:\",width=181 ]      by far the strongest feature in the extinction curve is the 2175  `` bump '' ( see figures [ fig : alambda_over_ai ] and [ fig : alambda_over_nh ] ) .",
    "stecher & donn ( 1965 ) pointed out that the observed feature coincided closely with the position and width of absorption expected from small spheres of graphite .",
    "graphite consists of parallel sheets of graphene  two - dimensional hexagonal carbon lattices ; adjacent graphene layers interact only through a weak van der waals interaction .",
    "the 2175  feature arises from a @xmath32 excitation of a @xmath33 orbital in graphene ; in small graphite spheres the feature strength corresponds to an oscillator strength per c of 0.16 ( draine 1989 ) , so that the observed 2175  feature requires c / h@xmath34 60  ppm @xmath35 to account for the observed strength of the 2175  feature .    in a large pah molecule ,",
    "the interior c atoms have electronic orbitals closely resembling those in graphene , and one therefore expects that large pah molecules will have a strong absorption feature peaking near 2175 , with an oscillator strength per c expected to be close to the value for graphite .",
    "it is of course interesting to note that the c / h in pahs required to account for the 315@xmath25 ir emission is @xmath36 of that required to account for the 2175  bump . since it would be entirely natural to have additional pahs containing @xmath37 c atoms it is plausible that the 2175feature could be entirely due to pahs , in which case the pahs contain c / h @xmath34 60  ppm .",
    "the 2175  feature is suppressed in graphite grains with @xmath38 because the grain becomes opaque throughout the 18002600  range .",
    "there can therefore be additional `` aromatic '' c within @xmath38 grains .",
    "interstellar dust has a strong absorption feature at 9.7@xmath25 . while the precise composition and structure of the carrier remains uncertain , there is little doubt that the 9.7@xmath25 feature is produced by the si  o stretching mode in silicates . in the laboratory ,",
    "crystalline silicates have multiple narrow features in their @xmath40 spectra , while amorphous silicate material has a broad profile .",
    "the interstellar 9.7@xmath25 feature is seen in absorption on a number of sightlines .",
    "the observed profiles are broad and relatively featureless , indicative of amorphous silicate material .",
    "the observed strength of teh absorption feature requires that much , perhaps most , of interstellar si atoms reside in silicates .",
    "li & draine ( 2001a ) estimated that at most 5% of interstellar silicate material was crystalline .",
    "conceivably , a mixture of a large number of different crystalline minerals ( bowey & adamson 2002 ) could blend together to produce the observed smooth profiles , although it seems unlikely that nature would have produced a blend of crystalline types with no fine structure evident in either absorption or emission , including emission in the far - infrared ( draine 2003a ) . the @xmath41 extinction profile does not appear to be `` universal ''  sightlines through the diffuse ism show a _ narrower _ feature than sightlines through dense clouds ( roche & aitken 1984 ; bowey et al .",
    "evidently the silicate material is altered in interstellar space .",
    "identification of the 9.7@xmath25 feature as the si  o stretching mode is confirmed by the presence of a broad feature centered at @xmath3018@xmath25 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1980 , smith et al .",
    "2000 ) that is interpreted as the o  si ",
    "o bending mode in silicates .",
    "spectral features of crystalline silicates are seen in some circumstellar disks ( artymowicz 2000 , waelkens et al .",
    "2000 ) and some comets ( hanner 1999 ) , but even in these objects only a minority of the silicate material is crystalline ( e.g. , bouwman et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "sightlines with sufficient obscuration reveal a broad absorption feature at 3.4@xmath25 that is identified as the c ",
    "h stretching mode in aliphatic ( i.e. , chain - like ) hydrocarbons .",
    "unfortunately , it has not proved possible to identify the specific aliphatic hydrocarbon material , and the band strength of this mode varies significantly from one aliphatic material to another .",
    "sandford et al .  ( 1991 ) suggest that the 3.4@xmath25 feature is due to short saturated aliphatic chains incorporating c / h @xmath34 11  ppm , while duley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) attribute the feature to hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) material containing c / h @xmath34 85  ppm .",
    "in addition to narrow absorption features identified as atoms , ions , and small molecules , the observed extinction includes a large number of broader features  known as the `` diffuse interstellar bands '' , or dibs .",
    "the first dib was recognized over 80 years ago ( heger 1922 ) , and shown to be interstellar 70 years ago ( merrill 1934 ) .",
    "a recent survey by jenniskens & desert ( 1994 ) lists over 154 `` certain '' dibs , with another 52 `` probable '' features .",
    "amazingly , not a single one has yet been positively identified !",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of the 5797  and 6614  dibs reveals fine structure that is consistent with rotational bands in a molecule with tens of atoms ( kerr et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) , and there is tantalizing evidence that dibs at 9577  and 9632may be due to c@xmath42 ( foing & ehrenfreund 1994 ; galazutdinov et al 2000 , but see also jenniskens et al .",
    "1997 and moutou et al .  1999 )    it appears likely that some or all of the dibs are due to absorption in large molecules or ultrasmall grains . as noted above , a large population of pahs is required to account for the observed ir emission , and it is reasonable to suppose that these pahs may be responsible for many of the dibs .",
    "what is needed now is laboratory gas - phase absorption spectra for comparison with observed dibs .",
    "until we have precise wavelengths ( and band profiles ) from gas - phase measurements , secure identification of dibs will remain problematic .",
    "interstellar dust grains luminesce in the far - red , a phenomenon referred to as the `` extended red emission '' ( ere ) .",
    "the highest signal - to - noise observations are in reflection nebulae , where a broad featureles emission band is observed to peak at wavelength @xmath43 @xmath44 , with a fwhm in the range 600 - 1000(witt & schild 1985 , witt & boroson 1990 ) .",
    "the ere has also been seen in h  ii regions ( darbon et al .",
    "2000 ) , planetary nebulae ( furton & witt 1990 ) , and the diffuse interstellar medium of our galaxy ( gordon et al .",
    "1998 , szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) .",
    "the ere is photoluminescence : absorption of a starlight photon raises the grain to an excited state from which it decays by spontaneous emission of a lower energy photon .",
    "the reported detection of ere from the diffuse interstellar medium ( gordon et al .",
    "1998 , szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) appears to require that the interstellar dust mixture have an overall photoconversion efficiency of order @xmath3010% for photons shortward of @xmath305000 .",
    "if the overall efficiency is @xmath3010% , the ere carrier itself must contribute a significant fraction of the overall absorption by interstellar dust at @xmath45 .",
    "candidate ere carriers which have been proposed include pahs ( dhendecourt et al .",
    "1986 ) and silicon nanoparticles ( ledoux et al .  1998 , witt et al .",
    "1998 , smith & witt 2002 ) . while some pahs are known to luminesce , attribution of the ere to pahs is difficult because of nondetection of pah emission from some regions where ere is seen ( sivan & perrin 1993 , darbon et al 2000 ) and nondetection of ere in some reflection nebulae with pah emission ( darbon et al 1999 ) .",
    "oxide - coated silicon nanoparticles appear to be ruled out by nondetection of infrared emission at @xmath46 ( li & draine 2002a ) .",
    "the search to identify the ere carrier continues .",
    "dust grains become nearly transparent at x - ray energies , so that the measured x - ray absorption is sensitive to _ all _ of the atoms , not just those in the gas phase .",
    "consider , for example , k shell absorption by an oxygen atom , where photoabsorption excites one of the 1s electrons to a higher ( initially vacant ) energy level .",
    "transitions to a bound state ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , ... ) produce a series of absorption lines , and transitions to unbound `` free '' ( i.e , `` photoelectron '' ) states result in a continuum beginning at the `` absorption edge '' .",
    "if the atom is in a solid , the absorption spectrum is modified because the available bound states and free electron states are modified by the presence of other nearby atoms .",
    "high resolution x - ray absorption spectroscopy of interstellar matter could thereby identify the chemical form in which elements are bound in dust grains ( forrey et al .",

    "observations appear to find spatial variations in the d / h ratio in the interstellar medium within @xmath103  pc , with values ranging from @xmath104  ppm toward @xmath105 orionis ( jenkins et al .",
    "1999 ) to @xmath106  ppm toward @xmath107 vel ( sonneborn et al .",
    "2000 ) . on longer sightlines in the galactic disk , hoopes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find d / h @xmath108  ppm toward hd 191877 ( @xmath109  pc ) and @xmath110  ppm toward hd 195965 ( @xmath111  pc ) .",
    "these variations in d / h are usually interpreted as indicating variations in `` astration '' , with as much as @xmath112 of the d on the sightline to @xmath105 ori having been `` burnt '' , vs.  only @xmath3020% of the d toward @xmath107vel .",
    "such large variations in astration between regions situated just a few hundred pc apart would be surprising , since the ism appears to be sufficiently well - mixed that large local variations in the abundances of elements like n or o are not seen outside of recognizable stellar ejecta such as planetary nebulae or supernova remnants .",
    "the solid carbon will be hydrogenated to some degree .",
    "the most highly pericondensed pah molecules ( coronene @xmath114 , circumcoronene @xmath115 , dicircumcoronene @xmath116 ) have h / c = @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the number of c atoms ; other pahs have higher h / c ratios for a given @xmath118 .",
    "let us suppose that the overall carbon grain material  including small pahs and larger carbonaceous grains  has h / c=0.25 .",
    "the carbonaceous grain population would then contain @xmath3050  ppm of hydrogen .",
    "if @xmath3020% of the hydrogen in the carbonaceous grains was deterium , the deuterium in the grains would then be ( d)@xmath119/(h)@xmath120  ppm . if the total d / h = 20  ppm , this would reduce the gas phase d / h to 10  ppm , comparable to the value observed toward @xmath105ori .",
    "is it conceivable the d / h ratio in dust grains could be @xmath121 times higher than the overall d / h ratio ?",
    "some interplanetary dust particles have d / h as high as .0017 ( messenger & walker 1997 , keller et al .",
    "2000 ) , although this factor @xmath3085 enrichment ( relative to d / h=20  ppm ) is still two orders of magnitude less than what is required to significantly affect the gas phase d / h value .",
    "extreme d enrichments are seen in some interstellar molecules  d@xmath0co",
    "/ h@xmath0co ratios in the range of .01 - 0.1 are seen ( ceccarelli et al 2001 ; bacmann et al 2003 ) , and attributed to chemistry on cold grain surfaces in dense clouds .",
    "could such extreme enrichments occur in the diffuse interstellar medium ?",
    "the thermodynamics is favorable .",
    "the h or d would be bound to the carbon via a c - h bond .",
    "the c - h bond  with a bond strength @xmath122  has a stretching mode at @xmath123 , while the c - d bond , with a larger reduced mass , has its stretching mode at @xmath124 . because of the difference in zero - point energy , the difference in binding energies is @xmath125 where the sum is over the stretching , in - plane bending , and out - of - plane bending modes , with @xmath126 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath25 .",
    "this exceeds the difference @xmath127 in binding energy between hd and h@xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore energetically favored for impinging d atoms to displace bound h atoms via reactions of the form ( bauschlicher 1998 ) @xmath128 the branching ratio @xmath129 > 10 ^ 4 $ ] if @xmath130 .",
    "if no other reactions affect the grain hydrogenation , then the grains would gradually become d - enriched .    however , the interstellar medium is far from lte  the hydrogen is atomic ( rather than molecular ) and , indeed , partially ionized because of the presence of ultraviolet photons , x - rays , and cosmic rays .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the mixture of non - lte reactions will allow the grains to become deuterated to a level approaching d / h @xmath34 1/4 , but it seems possible that this may occur .",
    "deuterated pahs would radiate in the c - d stretching and bending modes at @xmath131 , 12.2 , and 16.0@xmath25 .",
    "the 12.2@xmath25 emission will be confused with c - h out - of - plane bending emission ( see figure [ fig : pah ] ) , but the other two modes should be searched for .    even if extreme d - enrichment of carbonaceous grains is possible , it will take time to develop .",
    "meanwhile , the gas in which the grain is found may undergo a high velocity shock , with grain destruction by a combination of sputtering and ion field emission in the high temperature postshock gas .",
    "d incorporated into dust grains would be released and returned to the gas phase if those dust grains are destroyed .",
    "pahs , in particular , would be expected to be easily sputtered in shock - heated gas ; destruction by ion field emission would be expected to be even more rapid . thus if d is depleted into dust grains",
    ", we would expect to see the gas - phase d / h to be larger in recently - shocked regions .",
    "this could explain the large d / h value observed by sonneborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) toward @xmath107vel .",
    "it should be noted that significant depletion of d from the gas can only occur if there is sufficient carbonaceous grain material to retain the d. this can occur if gas - phase abundances are approximately solar ( with @xmath30200  ppm c in dust ) but would not be possible for abundances significantly below solar ",
    "e.g. , the abundances in the lmc and smc .",
    "the factor - of - two variations in d / h seen in the local interstellar medium would _ not _ be possible in gas with metallicities characteristic of the lmc , smc , or high - velocity clouds such as `` complex c '' ( see jenkins 2003 ) .",
    "elements like mg , si , al , ca , ti , fe , ni are concentrated in interstellar dust grains . since dust grains can move through the gas , transport in dust grains could produce local variations in elemental abundances .",
    "starlight is typically anisotropic , as can be confirmed by viewing the night sky on a clear night .",
    "the anisotropy is a function of wavelength , with larger anisotropies at shorter wavelengths because uv is ( 1 ) more strongly attenuated by dust grains and ( 2 ) originates in a smaller number of short - lived stars that are clustered . at the location of the sun , weingartner & draine ( 2001b )",
    "found starlight anistropies ranging from 3% at 5500  to 21% at 1565 .",
    "the dust grains are charged , and fairly well - coupled to the magnetic field lines .",
    "let @xmath132 be the angle between the starlight anisotropy direction and the magnetic field .",
    "the drift tends to be approximately parallel to the magnetic field direction , with a magnitude @xmath133 ; for a starlight anisotropy of 10% , @xmath134 in the `` warm neutral medium '' , and @xmath135 in the `` cold neutral medium '' ( weingartner & draine 2001b ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is nonuniform , spatial variations in the drift velocity can then lead to variations in the dust / gas ratio . indeed ,",
    "if there are `` valleys '' in the magnetic field ( with respect to the direction of radiation anisotropy  , the dust grains would tend to be concentrated there .",
    "radiation pressure acting on the concentrated dust grains would in fact cause such perturbations in the magnetic field to be unstable .",
    "dust impact detectors on the ulysses and galileo spacecraft measure the flux and mass distribution of interstellar grains entering the solar system , finding a much higher flux of very large ( @xmath138 dust grains than would be expected for the average interstellar grain size distribution ( frisch et al .",
    "the inferred local dust size distribution is very difficult to reconcile with the average interstellar grain population ( weingartner & draine 2001a ) , but we must keep in mind that the dust grains entering the solar system over a time scale of a few years are sampling a tiny region of the interstellar medium of order a few au in size .",
    "it is possible that the solar system just happens to be passing through a region in the local interstellar cloud which has been enhanced in the abundance of large grains due to radiation - driven grain drift .        1 .",
    "motion of dust through gas can result from gravitational sedimentation of dust grains in star - forming clouds ( flannery & krook 1978 ) .",
    "this could lead to enhanced abundances in stars of those elements which are depleted into dust in star - forming clouds .",
    "star formation is accompanied by ambipolar diffusion of magnetic field out of the contracting gas cloud .",
    "charged dust grains , while not perfectly coupled to the magnetic field , will tend to drift outward , resulting in reduction of the abundances of the depleted elements in the star - forming core ( ciolek & mouschovias 1996 ) .",
    "3 .   gravitational sedimentation in an accretion disk can concentrate dust at the midplane .",
    "gammie ( 1996 ) has suggested `` layered accretion '' , in which viscous stresses are effective along the surface layers of the disk , but the midplane is a quiescent `` dead zone '' as far as the magnetorotational instability is concerned .",
    "this could suppress stellar abundances of depleted elements .",
    "4 .   in thick disks ,",
    "small bodies orbit more rapidly than the gas , with gas drag leading to radial infall of these bodies .",
    "this could enhance stellar abundances of depleted species .",
    "before accretion terminates , a massive star may attain a pre - main - sequence luminosity high enough for radiation pressure to drive a drift of dust grains away from it .",
    "this would suppress stellar abundances of depleted elements .    given these competing mechanisms ,",
    "the net effect could be of either sign , but , as pointed out by snow ( 2000 ) , it would not be suprising if stars had abundances which differed from the overall abundances of the interstellar medium out of which they formed , and it would also not be surprising if the resulting abundances depended on stellar mass . in this connection it is interesting to note that the study by sofia & meyer ( 2001 ) finds that abundances of mg and si in b stars appear to be significantly below the abundances of these elements in young f and g disk stars , or in the sun ; they conclude that the abundances in b stars do not provide a good representation of interstellar abundances .",
    "as discussed by jenkins ( 2003 ) , determinations of elemental abundances from interstellar absorption line observations may require estimation of the fraction in unobserved ionization states , such as na  ii , k  ii , or ca  iii .",
    "such estimates require knowledge of the rates for ionization and recombination processes .",
    "neutral or negatively - charged dust grains provide a pathway for ion neutralization that for some cases can be faster than ordinary radiative recombination with free electrons ( weingartner & draine 2002 ) .        1 .",
    "the chemical composition of interstellar dust remains uncertain .",
    "pah molecules are present , and a substantial fraction of the grain mass most likely consists of amorphous silicate , but precise compositional information still eludes us .",
    "the grain size distribution is strongly constrained by observations of extinction , scaterring , and infrared emission , and extends from grains containing just tens of atoms to grains with radii @xmath139 .",
    "3 .   dust grains will drift through interstellar gas , and this transport process could produce local variations in the dust / gas ratio .",
    "the dust mass required to account for interstellar extinction using homogeneous spherical grains exceeds that inferred from depletion studies ( jenkins 2003 ) by a factor @xmath140 .",
    "dust grains could possibly deplete a significant fraction of interstellar d. this mechanism should be considered as a possible explanation for observed variations in the interstellar d / h ratio ."
