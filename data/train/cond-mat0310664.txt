    "are localised at random positions with thermal fluctuations of finite range .",
    "the system will be found in one of many possible equilibrium states .",
    "one such state is singled out arbitrarily , denoted by @xmath2 and specified by nonzero local static density fluctuations @xmath3 . here , @xmath4 is the position of particle @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes a thermal average restricted to equilibrium state @xmath2 .",

    "localisation in the equilibrium state @xmath2 is detected by higher - order moments , the simplest one being the second : @xmath9 = \\delta_{{\\bf k}_1+{\\bf k}_2,{\\bf 0}}\\;\\omega({\\bf k}_1).\\ ] ] for this to be nonzero , macroscopic translational invariance requires @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a real - valued function .",
    "the second moment vanishes in the isotropic fluid phase and diagnoses the localisation of particles .",
    "hence the second moment ( and in fact all higher moments , as will be discussed below ) serves as an order parameter for the transition from the fluid to the amorphous solid state .    in a different equilibrium state , denoted by @xmath12 ,",
    "all particles are translated with respect to the equilibrium state @xmath2 by a displacement @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian there is in fact a manifold of symmetry - related states , generated by spatially uniform translations .",
    "how do we have to generalise the representation of the order parameter ( [ naive_orderpar ] ) , in order to take into account the underlying translational symmetry of the hamiltonian ? for two equilibrium states , @xmath12 and @xmath15 , the second moment is given by @xmath16    =   { \\rm e}^{i{\\bf k}_1\\cdot({\\bf a}^{\\mu}-{\\bf a}^{\\rho}})\\ , \\delta_{{\\bf k}_1+{\\bf k}_2,{\\bf 0}}\\;\\omega({\\bf k}_1)\\,.\\ ] ] we introduce a longitudinal wavevector @xmath17 and a transverse wavevector @xmath18 and rewrite the above expression @xmath19 in terms of a transverse displacement @xmath20 .",
    "thereby , the second moment is represented by its magnitude   @xmath21 and the generator of transverse translations @xmath22 .",
    "the interpretation of the order parameter is more intuitive for the second moment as a function of real - space variables : @xmath23 .",
    "it does not depend on @xmath24 , and hence can be visualised as a rectilinear _ hill _ , whose position is specified by a pair of pure states . in a simple model of particle localisation in @xmath25 dimensions , a fraction @xmath26 of the particles are harmonically bound to random positions with random mean square displacements @xmath27 , giving rise to @xmath28 here @xmath29 $ ] is the disorder - averaged distribution of squared localisation lengths of the @xmath30 localised particles .",
    "the width of the hill is thus given by the typical value @xmath31 of the localisation length .",
    "the structure in one space dimension is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : hill ] .",

    "this pattern of symmetry breaking suggests that the goldstone excitations of an equilibrium state are constructed from it _ via _",
    "@xmath33- dependent translations of the hill in the @xmath34 direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , _ ripples _ of the hill and its ridge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ripples ] ) . in fourier space , the generalisation of eq .",
    "( [ generalop ] ) to inhomogeneous displacements reads @xmath35 the corresponding representation in real space is completely equivalent : @xmath36",
    "in the following , we apply the general concepts of goldstone excitations to a particular amorphous solid state  gels and vulcanised matter . for these systems",
    "a semi - microscopic model provides a framework for analysing the transition from the viscous fluid to the gel , as well as the structural and thermal properties of the gel , quantitatively .",
    "here we use it to compute the free energy of goldstone fluctuations , identify it with the elastic free energy , and thereby extract the shear modulus .    the transition from the viscous fluid to the gel",
    "is controlled by the number of crosslinks , connecting randomly chosen pairs of monomers .",
    "these monomers can be part of a larger prefabricated structure , such as chains consisting of @xmath37 monomers or stars or dimers _ etc_. for the following , the internal structure of the molecules is almost irrelevant ; it will only determine certain parameter values .",
    "the average over the quenched disorder ( _ i.e. _  the number and location of the crosslinks ) is performed with help of the replica trick .",
    "the resulting , effectively uniform , theory is formulated in terms of a field @xmath38 defined over @xmath39-fold replicated space @xmath40 , so that the argument @xmath40 means the collection of @xmath39 position @xmath25-vectors @xmath41 . according to the replica scheme of deam and edwards  @xcite , the disorder - averaged free energy @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 .",
    "where @xmath44 is the temperature .",
    "the replica partition function @xmath45 is given as a functional integral @xmath46 over the field @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes wavevectors conjugate to @xmath40 .",
    "the expectation value of the field is given by @xmath49 for this to be nonzero , macroscopic translational invariance requires @xmath50 .",
    "the case with only one of the @xmath51 wavevectors nonzero corresponds to the ( particle number ) density  ( [ density ] ) .",
    "density fluctuations are suppressed by excluded volume interactions , which tend to maintain homogeneity .",
    "therefore the theory , in its simplest version , contains only fluctuating fields for which at least two of the @xmath25-component entries in the argument @xmath52 are nonzero .",
    "we refer to such @xmath53 dimensional vectors as the higher - order replica sector ( hrs ) .",
    "fields with @xmath54 non - vanishing @xmath25-dimensional wavevectors correspond to the @xmath54th moment of the local density , so in particular @xmath55 yields the second moment discussed above .",
    "we consider a finite - dimensional system with a small number of nearest neighbours , implying that fluctuations of the local density are in general non - gaussian and all moments need to be taken into account .",
    "the _ translational _ invariance of the system is reflected in the invariance of the effective hamiltonian @xmath56 under _ independent translations of the replicas_. in the amorphous solid state this symmetry is broken down to invariance under the subgroup of common translations of all the replicas .",
    "the manifold of symmetry - related classical solutions ( _ i.e. _  saddle points of @xmath56 ) is given by @xmath57 in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ generalop ] ) .",
    "we have decomposed wavevectors into longitudinal and transverse components with help of a complete orthonormal basis set in replica space @xmath58 .",
    "the `` longitudinal '' direction in @xmath51 dimensional replica space is the unit vector @xmath59 , which is constant in replica space .",
    "all @xmath53 dimensional vectors can be expanded in this basis : _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath60 and decomposed into longitudinal ( @xmath61 ) and transverse ( @xmath62 ) components : @xmath63 analogous expressions hold for @xmath40 and @xmath64 .",
    "invariance under common translations of all replicas is guaranteed in the classical solution ( [ eq : classicalstate ] ) by the kronecker delta , which enforces the longitudinal wavevector @xmath65 to be zero .",
    "the manifold of symmetry - related states is generated by purely transverse displacements .",
    "the order parameter  ( [ eq : classicalstate ] ) exhibits the structure in replicated @xmath40-space discussed above for the second moment of the local density in different equilibrium states .",
    "the classical state @xmath66 can be visualised as a rectilinear hill in @xmath40-space with contours of constant height oriented parallel to @xmath67 .",
    "symmetry - related classical states are obtained by translating the hill rigidly , perpendicular to the ridge - line .",
    "goldstone excitations from the classical state are constructed _ via _ @xmath68-dependent translations of the hill in the @xmath69-direction @xcite , _ i.e. _ , ripples of the hill and its ridge :    @xmath70    we are interested here in the low energy excitations only and , hence , consider goldstone fluctuations , whose energy is expected to vanish with a power of the inverse wavelength of the ripples .",
    "we neglect all other fluctuations , which are expected to be massive . for consistency",
    "we thus should restrict ourselves to goldstone fluctuations with wavelengths that are larger than a short distance cutoff @xmath71 .",
    "in particular we require that the displacement @xmath72 varies on length scales larger than the width of the interface and take @xmath73 .",
    "the physical content of this restriction is that , to be meaningful , elastic deformations should occur on length - scales longer than the typical localisation length of the particles in the elastic medium .    as discussed after eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdinterpret ] ) , the critical fields of the theory reside in the hrs .",
    "hence we want to make sure that the distortions of the order parameter remain in this sector .",
    "this is guaranteed if the distortions fulfill the incompressibility constraint : @xmath74 , which , for small amplitude distortions , reduces to @xmath75 .",
    "for the present purposes the essential term in the effective hamiltonian @xmath56 @xcite is the quadratic gradient  term , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are , respectively , the number - density and linear size of the underlying entities being constrained and @xmath79 indicates that only wave vectors in the higher - order replica sector are to be included in the summation .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : landaueffective ] ) was originally obtained _ via _ an expansion valid close to the critical point , such a quadratic gradient term is expected to feature in a description valid deep inside the solid state . if one is seeking  as we are  the dominant contribution to the elastic free energy governing the displacement field @xmath80 ( _ i.e. _  the leading - order term in @xmath80 and @xmath65 ) then it is adequate to retain solely this quadratic gradient term .    inserting the fluctuating field into @xmath56 and computing the _ increase _ , @xmath81 , due to the distortion",
    "@xmath80 ( _ i.e. _  the elastic free energy ) gives the following contribution , which arises solely from the quadratic gradient  term in @xmath56 :    [ eq : elasticcouple ] @xmath82    here , summation over repeated cartesian indices @xmath83 is implied and the displacement vectors @xmath84 have to fulfill the constraint @xmath85 .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that in the classical state  ( [ eq : classicalstate ] ) @xmath86 with the fraction of localised particles @xmath87 and the distribution of localisation lengths @xmath88 , expressed in terms of a universal classical scaling function @xmath89 . here , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , respectively , the control parameter for the density of constraints and the nonlinear coupling constant . a semi - microscopic model of vulcanised macromolecular matter yields @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath12 controls the mean number of constraints ( and has critical value @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 is the persistence length of the macromolecules , and @xmath37 is the number of segments per macromolecule . if the network is built up from single monomers , corresponding to @xmath98 , then @xmath97 is interpreted as the length of the tether connecting two point - like particles .",
    "we substitute this classical value of the order parameter into eq .",
    "( [ eq : replicastiffness ] ) and take the replica limit @xmath99 to obtain the shear modulus @xmath100 the shear modulus increases continuously from zero with the third power of the distance from the gel point , in agreement with the previous microscopic calculation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "a simple scaling argument is also consistent : the free energy density scales with the correlation length @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "this is to be compared with the elastic free energy density of eq .",
    "( [ eq : elasticenergy ] ) .",
    "since @xmath103 is dimensionless this implies @xmath104 . at @xmath105",
    "we find agreement , which is to be expected since our calculation is based on a gaussian expansion around the classical solution .",
    "we discuss the effects of goldstone fluctuations at the level of gaussian fluctuations  ( [ eq : elasticenergy ] ) only .",
    "the elastic green function is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 . here",
    ", the integration over wave - numbers is restricted to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the linear size of the system .",
    "the mean value of the distorted classical state , @xmath110 is determined by the local green function @xmath111 . in space dimension",
    "@xmath112 , @xmath113 is finite , so that the order parameter has a finite expectation value .",
    "the latter is reduced , due to goldstone fluctuations , as one would expect : in addition to independent fluctuations of the localised particles there are also collective fluctuations  transverse phonons  which effectively increase the extent of spatial fluctuations of the localised particles .",
    "this is best seen by recalling the classical structure for @xmath114 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfstate ] ) : @xmath115    order parameter correlations are given within the gaussian approximation by @xmath116 in @xmath117 , the asymptotics of the elastic green function for large separation @xmath118 is well known , @xmath119 , implying for the correlator of the order parameter @xmath120 where @xmath121 .    in two space dimensions , @xmath113 increases logarithmically with the system size , so that the expectation value of the order parameter  ( [ eq : orderparameter ] ) vanishes in the macroscopic limit .",
    "goldstone fluctuations destroy localisation in two space dimensions , in agreement with the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "nevertheless , a two - dimensional amorphous solid persists , which is characterised by algebraic decay of order parameter correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ , quasi - long - range ( random ) order .",
    "the asymptotics of the elastic green function for large spatial separation is given by @xmath122 , implying an algebraic decay of the order - parameter correlations with a non - universal exponent @xmath123 : @xmath124 this scenario is similar to the theory of two - dimensional regular solids , taking into account harmonic phonons only , as discussed in ref .",
    "the main difference is the absence of bragg peaks at reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "instead , there is a divergence in the scattering function at @xmath125 , as can be seen by integrating the correlator , above , over all @xmath126@xcite : @xmath127 .",
