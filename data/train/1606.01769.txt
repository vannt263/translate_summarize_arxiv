    "inspiralling compact binaries containing spinning black holes ( bhs ) are plausible sources for the network of second generation gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors like the advanced ligo ( aligo ) , advanced virgo , kagra , geo - hf and the planned ligo - india @xcite .",
    "the inspiral dynamics and associated gws from compact binaries can be accurately described using the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an optimal detection technique of _ matched filtering _ is employed to detect and characterize inspiral gws from such binaries . in this technique",
    ", one cross correlates the interferometric output data with a bank of templates that theoretically model inspiral gws from spinning binaries .",
    "the construction of these templates involves modeling the two gw polarization states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , associated with such events , in an accurate and efficient manner . at present , gw frequency and associated phase evolution , crucial inputs to compute @xmath4 , are known to 3.5pn order for non - spinning compact binaries @xcite whereas the amplitudes are available to 3pn order @xcite . in the case of spinning components ,",
    "the spin effects enter the dynamics and gw emission via spin - orbit ( so ) and spin - spin ( ss ) interactions @xcite . additionally , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 , the two spin and orbital angular momenta , for generic spinning compact binaries precess around the total angular momentum @xmath7 due to",
    "so and ss interactions .",
    "this forces substantial modulations of the emitted gws from inspiralling generic spinning compact binaries @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to incorporate various spin effects while constructing inspiral gw templates for spinning compact binaries . at present , gw frequency evolution and amplitudes of @xmath4 for maximally spinning bh binaries are fully determined to 2.5pn and 2pn orders , respectively , while incorporating all the relevant spin induced effects @xcite .",
    "there exist inspiral waveforms for precessing binaries , implemented in the lalsimulation package of ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) @xcite , that employ the _ precessing convention _ of @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of this convention is its ability to remove all the spin precession induced modulations from the orbital phase evolution .",
    "this allows one to express the orbital phase @xmath8 as an integral of the orbital frequency @xmath9 , namely @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in this convention , the inspiral waveform from precessing binaries can be written as the product of a non - precessing carrier waveform and a modulation term that contains all the precessional effects .",
    "the convention involves a _ precessing source frame _ @xmath11 whose basis vectors satisfy the evolution equations @xmath12 .",
    "the angular frequency @xmath13 is constructed in such a manner that the three basis vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 always form an orthonormal triad .",
    "subsequently , @xmath16 has to be @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the usually employed precessional frequency for @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant expression for @xmath19 can be obtained by collecting the terms that multiply @xmath15 in equation ( 9 ) in @xcite .",
    "this triad defines an orbital phase @xmath8 such that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the unit vector along binary separation vector @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , one can express @xmath23 in the co - moving frame ( @xmath24 ) as @xmath25 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that @xmath16 should only be proportional to @xmath21 , leading to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the adiabatic condition for the sequence of circular orbits , namely @xmath27 , gives the desired result , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "it should be obvious that the above adiabatic condition can also imply @xmath29 .    in practice , the precessional equation for @xmath1",
    "is employed to construct @xmath16 and to evolve @xmath0 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath16 is no longer proportional to @xmath21 @xcite and this leads to pn corrections to @xmath30 ( see section 2.1 of @xcite for detailed calculation ) .",
    "these observations motivated us to provide a set of pn accurate equations to obtain temporally evolving quadrupolar order @xmath31 for generic spinning compact binaries in an @xmath32-based precessing convention . in the next section",
    ", we present our @xmath1-based precessing convention and explore its data analysis implications in the later section .",
    "in this section , we introduce a @xmath33-based precessing source frame ( @xmath34,@xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , to develop a @xmath33-based precessing convention , where @xmath33 is unit vector along @xmath1 .",
    "the precessional dynamics of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are provided by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the usual precessional frequency of @xmath33 .",
    "it should be obvious that @xmath42 is identical to @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "it is possible to construct a @xmath33-based co - moving triad ( @xmath45 ) and define an orbital phase @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "also , the time derivatives of @xmath21 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , the frame independent adiabatic condition for circular orbits , namely @xmath50 , leads to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "this results in the following 3pn accurate differential equation for @xmath46 , @xmath53 ^ 2\\biggr\\ } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the pn expansion parameter @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 . the kerr parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the two compact objects of mass @xmath62 and @xmath63 specify their spin angular momenta by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the unit vectors along @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the use of @xmath1 to describe binary orbits also modifies the evolution equation for @xmath67 ( or @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is because the so interactions are usually incorporated in terms of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in the literature @xcite .",
    "these terms require modifications due to the 1.5pn order relation between @xmath70 and @xmath33 which can be obtained from equation  ( 8) in @xcite .",
    "the pn accurate expression for @xmath71 along with the 3pn additional terms is given by equation ( 9 ) in @xcite .",
    "notice that these additional terms are , for example , with respect to equation ( 3.16 ) in @xcite that provides pn accurate expression for @xmath71 while invoking @xmath70 to describe binary orbits .",
    "we now model inspiral gws from spinning binaries in our @xmath33-based precessing convention .",
    "the expressions for quadrupolar order @xmath72 and @xmath73 , written in the frame - less convention @xcite , read    [ eq_hp_hx ] @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the @xmath58 and @xmath77 components of @xmath78 and @xmath21 in an inertial frame associated with @xmath79 , the unit vector that points from the source to the detector , while @xmath80 is the distance to the binary .",
    "these @xmath58 and @xmath77 components of @xmath78 and @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of the cartesian components of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in order to obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we require to solve numerically the differential equations for @xmath83 and @xmath35 .",
    "we use equation  ( [ eq_phidot ] ) for @xmath46 while the differential equation for @xmath58 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by equations  ( 9 ) and ( 13 ) in @xcite .",
    "it easy to see that the evolution of @xmath34 and @xmath35 depends upon the time variation of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we also need to solve differential equations for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath33 .",
    "these differential equations that include the leading order so and ss interactions can be obtained from equation  ( 15 ) in @xcite .    in practice",
    ", we numerically solve the differential equations for @xmath84 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath46 and @xmath58 to obtain temporally evolving cartesian components of @xmath78 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that we do not solve the differential equation for @xmath35 .",
    "this is because the temporal evolution of @xmath35 can be estimated using the relation @xmath85 .",
    "the required initial values for the cartesian components of @xmath34 , @xmath33 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given by freely choosing the following five angles : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the initial cartesian components of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 as functions of the above angles are given by equations  ( 16 ) in @xcite .",
    "note that this choice of initial conditions is influenced by the lalsuite spintaylort4 code of lsc .",
    "additionally , we let the initial @xmath58 value to be @xmath91 where @xmath92 hz ( relevant for aligo ) and the initial phase @xmath93 to be zero . in",
    "what follows , we explore the data analysis implications of these inspiral waveforms that employ the @xmath1-based precessing convention .",
    "we employ the _ match _ @xcite to compare inspiral waveforms constructed via the @xmath70 and @xmath33-based precessing conventions .",
    "our comparison is influenced ( and justified ) by the fact that the precessing source frames of these two conventions are functionally identical .",
    "this should be evident from the use of _ the same _ precessional frequency , appropriate for @xmath33 , to obtain pn accurate expressions for both the @xmath70-based @xmath16 and @xmath33-based @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the _ match _ estimates probe influences of the additional 3pn order terms present in the differential equations for @xmath46 and @xmath58 in our approach .",
    "note that these 3pn order terms are not present in the usual implementation of the precessing convention as provided by the lalsuite spintaylort4 code .",
    "our match @xmath94 computations involve @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the two families of inspiral waveforms arising from the @xmath70 and @xmath33-based precessing conventions .",
    "the @xmath97 inspiral waveform families are adapted from the lalsuite spintaylort4 code of lsc while @xmath96 families arise from our approach ( equations  ( [ eq_hp_hx ] ) ) .",
    "we employ the quadrupolar order expressions for @xmath31 while computing @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the present analysis .",
    "moreover , the two families are characterized by identical values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "also , the initial orientations of the two spins in the @xmath79-based inertial frame are also chosen to be identical .",
    "the computation of @xmath102 from @xmath103 with the help of equation  ( 8) in @xcite ensures that @xmath70 and @xmath33 orientations at the initial epoch are physically equivalent .",
    "therefore , our match computations indeed compare two waveform families with physically equivalent orbital and spin configurations at the initial epoch .",
    "note that we terminate @xmath95 and @xmath96 inspiral waveform families when their respective @xmath58 parameters reach @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "figure  [ figure : q_m_phi ] represents the result of our @xmath106 computations .",
    "the binary configurations have initial dominant so misalignments @xmath107 @xmath108 as @xmath109 and we let the initial orbital plane orientation in the @xmath79-based inertial frame to take two values leading to edge - on ( @xmath110 ) and face - on ( @xmath111 ) binary orientations . for these two configurations , we need to choose @xmath86 to be @xmath109 and @xmath112 , respectively . moreover , we choose @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "let us note that @xmath70 orientations ( from @xmath79 ) for these configurations will be slightly different from @xmath116 or @xmath117 due to the 1.5pn accurate relation between @xmath70 and @xmath33 .",
    "plots for the accumulated orbital phase ( @xmath118 ) and the associated match ( @xmath119 ) estimates as functions of the mass ratio @xmath120 for maximally spinning @xmath121 bh binaries inspiralling in the @xmath122 $ ] frequency interval . ]",
    "we also plot @xmath123 , the accumulated orbital phase differences in the frequency interval @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "we find that the variations in @xmath106 estimates are quite independent of the initial orbital plane orientations .",
    "we see a gradual decrease in @xmath106 values as we increase the @xmath120 value and this variation is reflected in the gradual increase of @xmath123 .",
    "incidentally , this pattern is also observed for configurations having somewhat smaller initial dominant so misalignments .",
    "however , the @xmath106 estimates are close to unity for tiny @xmath124 values and this is expected as precessional effects are minimal for such binaries .",
    "therefore , the effect of the above discussed additional 3pn order terms are more pronounced for high mass ratio compact binaries having _ moderate _",
    "dominant so misalignments .",
    "we find that the match estimates are less than the optimal 0.97 value for a non - negligible fraction of unequal mass spinning compact binaries .",
    "it may be recalled that such an optimal match value roughly corresponds to a @xmath125 loss in the ideal event rate .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the additional 3pn order terms in frequency and phase evolution equations in our approach should not be neglected for a substantial fraction of unequal mass binaries .",
