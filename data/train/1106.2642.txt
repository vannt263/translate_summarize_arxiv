    "cosmological observations provide compelling evidence that about 95% of the content of the universe resides in two unknown forms , denoted dark matter and dark energy , respectively . the former resides in bound objects as non - luminous matter , and the latter in the form of a zero - point energy that pervades the whole universe @xcite .",
    "dark matter is thought to be composed of cold neutral weakly interacting massive particles , beyond those existing in the standard model of particle physics , and not yet detected in accelerators or in direct and indirect searches .",
    "there are many possible candidates for dark matter , the most popular ones being the axions and the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) ( for a review of the particle physics aspects of dark matter see @xcite ) .",
    "their interaction cross section with normal baryonic matter , while extremely small , are expected to be non - zero and we may expect to detect them directly .",
    "scalar fields or other long range coherent fields coupled to gravity have also been used intensively to model galactic dark matter @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility that the galactic dynamics of massive test particles may be understood in the context of modified theories of gravity , without the need for dark matter , was also explored  @xcite .    despite these important achievements , at galactic scales @xmath0 kpc",
    ", the @xmath1cdm model meets with severe difficulties in explaining the observed distribution of the invisible matter around the luminous one . in order for galactic gas and stars to attain a constant velocity in the outer regions ,",
    "the density profile of the dark matter must fall approximately with @xmath2 in the respective regions .",
    "these profiles resemble the density structure of an isothermal and self - gravitating system of particles , characterized by a constant velocity dispersion .",
    "in fact , @xmath3-body simulations , performed in this scenario , predict that bound halos surrounding galaxies must have very characteristic density profiles that feature a well pronounced central cusp @xcite . on the observational side , high - resolution rotation curves show , instead , that the actual distribution of dark matter is much shallower than the above , and it presents a nearly constant density core @xcite .    the possibility that dark matter could be described by a fluid with non - zero effective pressure was also considered in the physical literature @xcite . in particular , in @xcite it was assumed that the equation of state of the dark matter halos is polytropic .",
    "the fit with a polytropic dark halo improves the velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "due to their importance in astrophysics and cosmology , two - fluid models have been extensively investigated in the physical literature .",
    "in particular , dust shells of finite size , moving with different four - velocities and forming a common region , where the two dust components exist simultaneously , were considered in @xcite for the case of a lemaitre - tolman geometry .",
    "to model voids a spherically symmetric dust with different energy density values has been matched by an intermediate region . by introducing two dust components the boundaries no longer need to be comoving .",
    "the two - component dust model was generalized in @xcite by introducing an additional homothetic vector .",
    "the obtained metrics are regular , except for a big bang singularity and in the limit of large times they can be given by an asymptotic expansion of the metric coefficients .",
    "using this family of solutions , voids whose edge is not comoving in comparison with its surroundings can be modeled in geometric terms .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the possibility that dark matter may be modeled as a mixture of two non - interacting perfect fluids , with different four - velocities .",
    "this configuration is formally equivalent to a single anisotropic fluid @xcite .",
    "we obtain the basic equations describing the structure of this system , namely , the mass continuity and the hydrostatic equilibrium equations , as well as the equation giving the tangential velocity of test particles in stable circular orbits . for the dark matter",
    "we adopt a non - relativistic kinetic description , with the fluid pressure proportional to the density of the fluid and to the velocity dispersion of the constituent particles . by assuming that the two fluids have the same density , the dark matter profile and the tangential velocity",
    "are obtained by numerically integrating the field equations .",
    "some cosmological implications of the model are also discussed , and it is shown that in the large time limit the initially anisotropic homogeneous two - fluid dark matter distribution ends in an isotropic phase .",
    "we start our study of dark matter by assuming that it consists of a mixture of two perfect fluids , with energy densities and pressures @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , respectively , and with four velocities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the fluid is described by the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 , given by @xmath11    the four - velocities are normalized according to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . in the present paper we use the natural system of units with @xmath14 .",

    "( [ emtensor ] ) can be significantly simplified if we cast it into the standard form of perfect anisotropic fluids .",
    "this can be done by means of the transformations @xcite @xmath15 representing a `` rotation '' of the velocity four - vectors in the @xmath16 velocity space , which leave the quadratic form @xmath17 invariant .",
    "thus , @xmath18 .",

    "thus , on a cosmological scale , and in the large time limit , the initially anisotropic dark matter fluid mixture behaves like an isotropic fluid .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the theoretical possibility that dark matter may be modeled as a mixture of two non - interacting perfect fluids , with different four - velocities .",
    "this model is formally equivalent to a single anisotropic fluid . by considering a purely kinetic description of dark matter the basic equations describing the dark matter mixture",
    "have been obtained , and integrated numerically . in the particular case in which @xmath174 , we can approximate @xmath175 , corresponding to two non - interacting pressureless fluids . for this case the theoretical model reduces to a single anisotropic fluid with vanishing tangential pressure . in the general case of arbitrary fluids",
    "there is a general @xmath176-dependent functional relationship between the energy density and the radial and tangential pressures , which differs radically from the simple barotropic equation of state . on the other hand ,",
    "in was shown in @xcite that half of the 14 galaxies considered in the study are well fit by the polytropic halo model , despite its serious physical simplifications .",
    "the necessity of considering non - standard dark matter models with pressure is justified by our uncertainties in the knowledge about the nature of the dark matter particle , as well as by the fact that this model gives a much better description of the observational results , as compared to the pressureless case . as a consistency check of our model",
    "we have considered the cosmological behavior of a mixture of two fluids , and we have showed that such a mixtures always isotropizes in the large time limit .    the approach used in the present paper is different from the method used in @xcite for the study of dust shells .",
    "first of all , the two fluids are described as a single effective anisotropic fluid . while in @xcite a non - comoving frame of reference is adopted , due to our transformation of the energy - momentum tensor ,",
    "we can write down and study the field equations in a comoving frame . moreover , the inclusion of the pressure terms is straightforward .",
    "we have also to point out the differences in geometry : while in @xcite the time - dependent lemaitre - tolman model is used , and additional symmetries are imposed in order to reduce the number of variables , in the present paper we are considering the properties of dark matter in a spherically symmetric static geometry .",
    "the present model can be easily generalized for other equations of state of dark matter , or for cases involving the presence of condensates or scalar fields .",
    "these possibilities , and their impact on dark matter distribution , as well as some cosmological implications , will be considered in some future studies .",
