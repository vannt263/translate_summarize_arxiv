    "quintessence ( caldwell et al . 1998 ) or dark energy is a new component of the cosmic medium that has been introduced in order to explain the dimming of distant snia  ( riess et al .",

    "the recent measures of the cmb at high resolution ( lange et al .",
    "2000 , de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 , balbi et al .",
    "2000 ) have added to the motivations for a conspicuous fraction of unclustered dark energy with negative pressure . in its simplest formulation ( see e.g. silveira & waga 1997 ) , the quintessence component can be modeled as a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath4 with @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 ( @xmath7 for acceleration ) . when @xmath8 we have pure cosmological constant , while for @xmath9 we reduce to the ordinary pressureless matter .",
    "the case @xmath10 mimicks a universe filled with cosmic strings ( see e.g. vilenkin 1984 ) .",
    "more realistic models possess an effective equation of state that changes with time , and can be modeled by scalar fields ( ratra & peebles 1988 , wetterich 1995 , frieman et al .",
    "1995 , ferreira and joyce 1998 ) , possibly with coupling to gravity or matter ( baccigalupi , perrotta & matarrese 2000 , amendola 2000 ) .",
    "the introduction of the new component modifies the universe expansion and introduces at least a new parameter , @xmath5 , in cosmology .",
    "most deep cosmological tests , from large scale structure to cmb , from lensing to deep counting , are affected in some way by the presence of the new field . here",
    "we study how a perfect fluid quintessence affects the dyer - roeder ( dr ) distance , a necessary tool for all lensing studies ( dyer & roeder 1972 , 1974 ) .",
    "the assumption of constant equation of state is at least partially justified by the relatively narrow range of redshift we are considering , @xmath11 .",
    "we rederive the dr equation in quintessence cosmology , we solve it analytically whenever possible , and give a very accurate analytical fit to its numerical solution . finally , we apply the dr solutions to a likelihood determination of @xmath0 through the observations of time - delays in multiple images .",
    "the dataset we use is composed of only six time - delays , and does not allow to test directly for quintessence ; however , we will show that inclusion of such cosmologies may have an important impact on the determination of @xmath0 with this method .",
    "for instance , we find that @xmath0 is smaller that for a pure cosmological constant . in this work we confine ourselves to flat space and extremal values of the beam parameter @xmath12 ; in a paper in preparation we extend to curved spaces and general @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we derive the dr distance in quintessence cosmology , find its analytical solutions , when possible , and its asymptotic solutions .",
    "finally , we give a very accurate analytical fit to the general numerical solutions as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "first of all , let us notice that when quintessence is present , the friedmann equation ( the @xmath13 component of the einstein equations in a flat frw metric ) becomes ( in units @xmath14 )    @xmath15 .\\ ] ]    where @xmath0 is the present value of the hubble constant , @xmath1 the present value of the matter density parameter , and where the scale factor is normalized to unity today . in terms of the redshift @xmath16 we can write @xmath17 where @xmath18    the ricci focalization equation in a conformally flat metric ( such as the frw metric ) with curvature tensor @xmath19 is ( see e.g. schneider , falco & ehlers 1992 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21  is the beam area and @xmath22 is the tangent vector to the surface of propagation of the light ray , and the dot means derivation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath23 .",

    "there are only seven lens systems with measured time - delays : b0218 + 357 ( biggs et al . 1999 ; lehr et al . 1999 ; patnaik porcas & browne 1995 ) , q0957 + 561 ( bar - kana et al .",
    "1999 ; kundi et al .",
    "1997 ) , he1104 - 1805 ( courbin , lidman & magain 1998 ; wisotzki , wucknitz , lopez &  srensen 1998 ) , pg1115 + 080 ( bar - kana 1997 ; impey et al .",
    "1998 ; schechter et al . 1996 ) , b1600 + 434 ( burud et al .",
    "2000 ; koopmans , de bruyn , xanthopoulos & fassnacht 2000 ) , b1608 + 656 ( fassnacht c. d. et al . 1999 ; koopmans & fassnacht 1999 ) and pks1830 - 211 ( lehr et al .",
    "1999 ; lovell et al . 1998 ; wiklind & combes 1999 ) . due to the image multiplicity",
    ", we have in total ten time - delays .",
    "the lens model we use , the isothermal lens of mao , witt and keeton ( mao , witt & keeton 2000 ) can not be adapted to q0957 + 561 and b1608 + 656 so we are left with five lens systems and six time - delays , as detailed in table ii .",
    "@xmath103    adopting the isothermal model , the relation between the distances of the deflector ( subscript @xmath104 ) and of the source ( @xmath105 ) and the time - delay between two images labelled 1 and 2 in terms of observable quantities is @xmath106 where @xmath107,\\ ] ] @xmath108 is the angular distance between one of the two images and the center of the deflector and where    @xmath109    to estimate @xmath0 we build the likelihood function @xmath110 , \\ ] ] where we separated between quantities that contain theoretical parameters and purely observational quantities by definining the variables @xmath111 and where @xmath112 is the total error on @xmath113 , obtained by standard error propagation ( this error is dominated by the uncertainty on the angular positions @xmath108 ) .",
    "then we marginalize over @xmath114 ( defined in the range @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively ) and produce the marginalized and normalized likelihood @xmath117 that represents the likelihood of @xmath0 ( normalized to unity by the constant @xmath118 ) given any possible perfect fluid quintessence model .",
    "we also evaluated @xmath119 and @xmath120 , marginalizing over the other variables , but the likelihoods we obtain are too flat to derive any interesting conclusion on the quintessence parameters .",
    "we also estimated the effect of imposing a gaussian prior on @xmath121 with mean 0.3 and standard deviation 0.1@xmath122 we compared the marginalized likelihood with the likelihood in the `` standard '' cases @xmath123 and @xmath8 ( pure cosmological constant ) , and @xmath60 and @xmath9 ( no quintessence ) .",
    "table iii summarizes the likelihood results : here 1,2,3@xmath37 stand for a probability of 68,95,99% , respectively ; the first four cases are marginalized over @xmath1 and @xmath5 , and the prior is the above mentioned gaussian on @xmath1 .",
    "the strongest effects are obtained in the empty beam case , @xmath41 , because in this case the quintessence term is dominating in the last term of the dr equation .",
    "the likelihood is shifted to lower values , in comparison to the two `` standard '' cases ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , with an increase in the variance . for @xmath42",
    "the shift is less evident and there is a degeneracy between marginalized likelihood and no quintessence likelihood .",
    "thus the dependency of @xmath0 for @xmath1  and @xmath5 is strongest in the empty beam case . with no prior",
    "we obtain @xmath124    @xmath125    already with six time - delays , the effect of a quintessence cosmology on the estimation of @xmath0 is therefore not negligible .",
    "a qualitative idea of how the method can perform in the future can be gained assuming that the same six time delays can be estimated with only a 10% error on the variable @xmath126 . in this case",
    ", we would get not only a better estimation of @xmath0 but also a substantial removal of the degeneracy with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "this exercise illustrates the potentiality of the method towards a detection of quintessence and a distinction from a pure cosmological constant .",
    "the results of the simulation for @xmath41 are summarized in table iv and in figure 6 .",
    "if 70% or so of the total matter content is filled by a new component with negative pressure and weak clustering , all the classical deep cosmological probes are affected in some way .",
    "here we addressed the question of how the dyer - roeder distance changes when this new component , quintessence , is taken into account .",
    "we have shown that , particularly in the case of empty beam , the effect of the quintessence is to move the estimate of @xmath0 to lower values with respect to two standard models , and to increase the spread of the likelihood distribution .",
    "this is the first time , to our knowledge , that a full likelihood analysis of the almost entire set of time - delays available is performed . as a byproduct of our analysis",
    ", we produced fits for a large range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath5 accurate to within 5%@xmath122    the future prospects seem interesting for the time - delay method : with a not unrealistic increase in accuracy ( or in the number of time delays ) , the quintessence could be detected and distinguished from a pure cosmological constant , thanks to the deepness to which lensing effects are observable .",
    "an obvious improvement of our analysis , currently underway , is to investigate the dependence on @xmath128 and on curvature , producing a fully marginalized likelihood for @xmath0 .",
