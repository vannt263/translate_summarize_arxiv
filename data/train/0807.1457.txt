    "entanglement has been studied intensely in recent years due to its fascinating nonclassical feature and potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite . as a simple system ,",
    "heisenberg model is an ideal candidate for the generation and the manipulation of entangled states .",
    "many physical systems , such as nuclear spins @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , superconductor @xcite and optical lattices @xcite , have been simulated by this model , and the heisenberg interaction alone can be used for quantum computation by suitable coding @xcite . recently ,",
    "the heisenberg models , including ising model @xcite , xy model @xcite , xxx model @xcite , xxz model @xcite and xyz model @xcite , have been intensively studied .",
    "_ investigated the effects of dm interaction , impurity and exchange couplings on entanglement in xy spin chain @xcite .",
    "_ studied the thermal entanglement of a two - qutrit ising system with dm interaction @xcite , they found that the control of entanglement can be optimized by utilizing competing effects of the magnetic field and the dm interaction .",
    "_ investigated the effects of the dm interaction and intrinsic decoherence on entanglement teleportation in the two - qubit xxx heisenberg model @xcite .    in the above models ,",
    "the influences of the z - component dm interaction ( arising from spin - orbit coupling ) and the external magnetic field on the entanglement have been discussed , but the dm coupling interactions along other directions have never been taken into account . quite recently , we discussed the influences of x - component dm interaction on entanglement in heisenberg xxz model @xcite and xyz model @xcite . to research further the differences between dm coupling interactions along different directions , in this paper",
    ", we generalize the special heisenberg models to the generalized heisenberg xyz models with different dm interactions , and then analyze the different influences of @xmath3 ( x - component dm control parameter ) , @xmath4 ( y - component dm control parameter ) and @xmath5 ( z - component dm control parameter ) on the entanglement and the critical temperature .",
    "we find that @xmath2 is the most efficient dm control parameter when @xmath0 is the largest spin coupling coefficient .",
    "thus , according to the relation among @xmath6 , we can know which is the most efficient dm control parameter . in order to provide a detailed analytical and numerical analysis ,",
    "here we take concurrence as a measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the concurrence @xmath7 ranges from 0 to 1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate the vanishing entanglement and the maximal entanglement respectively . for a mixed state @xmath10 , the concurrence of the state is @xmath11 , where @xmath12",
    "are the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath13 , and the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the heisenberg xyz models with different dm interaction parameters , and give the analytical expressions of the concurrences . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the different influences of different dm control parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) on the entanglement and the critical temperature . finally , in sec .",
    "iv a discussion concludes the paper .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 for a two - qubit anisotropic heisenberg xyz chain with dm interaction parameter @xmath3 is @xmath15 where @xmath6 are the real coupling coefficients , @xmath3 is the x - component dm coupling parameter , and @xmath16 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath17 corresponds to the antiferromagnetic case , and @xmath18 corresponds to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "this model can be reduced to some special heisenberg models by changing @xmath0 .",
    "parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 are dimensionless .    in the standard basis @xmath19 , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath20 by calculating , we can obtain the eigenstates of @xmath14 :    [ 3 ] @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    with corresponding eigenvalues :    [ 4 ] @xmath25 @xmath26    where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . the system state at thermal equilibrium ( thermal state ) is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 $ ] is the partition function of the system , @xmath14 is the system hamiltonian , @xmath31 is the temperature and @xmath32 is the boltzmann costant which we take equal to 1 for simplicity .",
    "thus , in the above standard basis , we can get the following analytical expression of the density matrix @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 after straightforward calculations , the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath13 can be expressed as :    [ 6 ] @xmath38 @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the concurrence of this system can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath41 which is consistent with the results in ref .",

    "we consider the case of the two - qubit anisotropic heisenberg xyz chain with y - component dm parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath43 where @xmath4 is the y - component dm coupling parameter , which is also dimensionless .    in the standard basis @xmath19 ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( 8) can be rewritten as @xmath44 similarly , by calculating , we can obtain the eigenstates of @xmath45 :    [ 10 ] @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49    with corresponding eigenvalues :    [ 11 ] @xmath50 @xmath51    where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . in the above standard basis , the density matrix @xmath54 has the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 then the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath59 can be obtained    [ 13 ] @xmath60 @xmath61    where @xmath62 .",

    "similarly , we can get the analytical expressions of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , but we do not list them because of the complexity .",
    "after straightforward calculations , the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath74 can be expressed as :    [ 18 ] @xmath75 @xmath76    with @xmath77 .",
