    "in @xcite borwein and sims investigated application of the douglas - rachford algorithm to a line intersecting a circle in 2 dimensional euclidean space . among the partial results obtained was local convergence near each of the intersection points .",
    "based on extensive computer experimentation , they were led to ask whether it could be extended to converge to one or other of the two intersection points for all starting points except those lying on a singular \" line orthogonal to the line in question and passing through the centre of the circle .",
    "this question was answered in the affirmative by benoist @xcite who showed the result by constructing a lyapunov function .",
    "we expand upon this work by considering two generalizations : that of the line with a @xmath0-sphere and that of a line with an ellipse",

[ fig : oneiterate ]    the weak convergence of the douglas - rachford iteration scheme for closed convex sets with nonempty intersection was proved first by lions and mercier in 1979 :    suppose @xmath20 are closed and convex with non - empty intersection .",

    "phase retrieval problems are one instance of this .",
    "the case of a line and a sphere in hilbert space is a simple prototype for such situations , which was considered by borwein and sims in @xcite . among other results , they established local convergence of the douglas - rachford algorithm near each of the intersection points .",
    "benoist extended this result in @xcite and proved that the sequence of douglas - rachford iterates converges in norm to the point of intersection nearest the initial value except when it belongs to the hyperplane of symmetry .",
    "we investigate the generalization of the douglas - rachford iteration scheme for the case of a line @xmath19 but with the sphere ( circle in 2 dimensional euclidean space ) replaced by an ellipse @xmath18 or a p - sphere @xmath24 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we introduce the following notation .    by a suitable rotation and scaling of axes we may without loss of generality write : @xmath25 when it is clear from the context what the parameters are we will simply write @xmath19 , @xmath18 or @xmath24 respectively . similarly , when the context makes it clear we will write @xmath15 in place of @xmath17 or @xmath26 .",

    "graphical analysis suggests that , while more results may be possible , we may not be able to fully describe all of the different possible cases of behavior . for certain lines ,",
    "points of period greater than 2 appear as in the left of figure  [ fig : pone ] where the line @xmath125 yields period 3 points .",

    "the situation becomes even more interesting in the case of the ellipse . as the ellipse is stretched ( as @xmath105 grows ) , we observe that the upper bound on periods for attractive periodic points appears to grow .",
    "the actual appearance of these points is still subject to small perturbations of the line . for the sake of simplicity",

    "however , the degree of complication even for the closed forms of points for the smallest non - fixed period suggested to us that fully describing all behavior globally with explicit forms would be an impractical undertaking .",
    "this , in part , led us to pursue the computer assisted evidence - gathering approach we describe in subsections  [ subsec : numerical ] .",
    "we turn our attention to the study of the basins of attraction for periodic points and local convergence to feasible points . the intersection of an ellipse and a line is locally similar to the intersection of a sphere and a line ( at an infinitessimal level , a line with another line ) . for",
    "this reason one would reasonably suspect that convergence of the algorithm should continue to hold locally for the ellipse .",
    "however , benoist s explicit lyapunov function for the @xmath27-sphere in @xcite was sufficiently complicated to suggest that - for the more complicated case of the ellipse - we pursue instead a numerical approximant of the level curves .",
    "this approach proved unsuccessful ; the reasons why are given in appendix  [ appendix : numericalinversion ] .",
    "for this reason , we sought an alternative method for plotting the curves .",
    "this led us to parallelization , the employment of which provided not only a way of plotting curves locally but also a method for clearly visualizing the basins of attraction .    in the absence of an explicit form or numerical approximant for lyapunov curves ,",
    "our best method for understanding the behavior in the case of ellipses with @xmath131 is to simulate the behavior with a large number of points and see what happens .",
    "indeed , this is what borwein did for the case of the sphere and the line prior to benoist s proof of the lyapnov function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 34 ) .",
    "the results given by such methods are quite compelling : they do not merely motivate the search for a formal proof where one may be attainable , but they also are increasingly necessary in cases where explicit proof may not be possible because the degree of complexity for a given problem precludes it .",
    "+ _ `` a heavy warning used to be given [ by lecturers ] that pictures are not rigorous ; this has never had its bluff called and has permanently frightened its victims into playing for safety . some pictures , of course , are not rigorous ,",

    "( j. e. littlewood , 1885 - 1977 ) from littlewood s miscellany ( p. 35 in 1953 edition ) , said long before the current graphic , visualization and geometric tools were available .",
    "+ however , the method we used for figure  [ fig : basinsall ] , though useful for discovery , is not alone sufficient for fully understanding the behavior , even for one specific ellipse and line .",
    "there are several reasons for this .    1",
    ".   there may be other periodic points we can not see because they are unstable and/or their basins are too small . a case of unstable periodic points for the ellipse",
    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sourcesandsinks ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : sourcesandsinks ] also illustrates that slight rotations of the line will move periodic points and may alter their stability .",
    "this method of visualization may be deceptive , as it precludes us from really seeing the shapes of the basins accurately .",
    "notice how the patterns of the iterates in figures  [ fig : sourcesandsinks ] and [ fig : twist ] form orderly spirals which look like twisting galaxies .",
    "this lovely pattern seems to hold for all the cases we have looked at .",
    "for example , zoomed - in pictures of the spirals in figure  [ fig : basinsall ] are shown in figure  [ fig : basinspirals ] .",
    "they are certainly beautiful to look at .",
    "intuition would suggest to us that this is perhaps indicative of smooth boundaries for the basins .",
    "however , a good visualization of the basins requires a more rigorous approach .",
    "3 .   the potential for numerical error",
    "is accentuated by the fact that the projection onto the ellipse is calculated by solving a function which , depending upon the location of the point for which we are computing , may have an incorrect root quite near to the root we seek .",
    "we sought a clearer picture using parallelization and higher precision",

    "for one of the larger proteins , convergence took an especially long time , and so the authors paused the computation after 5000 steps in order to render a picture of the protein .",
    "what they discovered was rather fascinating and is shown in figure  [ fig : bigprotein ]    at first the rendering on the right looks nothing like that of the true protein on the left .",
    "however , upon further scrutiny , it can be seen that there are actually two very good pieces which closely resemble the real protein and that they are merely separated by a great deal of `` spaghetti .

    "when the authors paused and rendered a picture of the protein after 28000 iterations , the resulting image was so difficult to tell apart from the true structure of the protein that we decline to include it here .",
    "while we can not say with any real certainty that the behavior when solving these euclidean distance matrices is analogous to iterates climbing out from inside of repelling basins or dodging and weaving amongst attractive basins , it is surprising that a system as simple as that of a simple ellipse with a line can create behavior so similar to that in far more complicated systems .",
