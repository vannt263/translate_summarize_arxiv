    "since the original paper of purcell @xcite the modification of atomic radiative decay due to the presence of optical and microwave cavities , photonic band gap ( pbg )  materials has become a familiar topic of study in quantum optics .",
    "the presence of these systems structures the modes of the electromagnetic ( em )  field , resulting in situations where the mode frequency dependences of the mode density or the atom - field coupling constants ( or both ) are changed from the free space situation .",
    "the quantum em field acts as a structured reservoir whose behaviour depends on the product of the mode density with the square of the coupling constants  the reservoir structure functions .  if the reservoir structure functions vary slowly with mode frequency , the corresponding reservoir correlation time may be short compared to the time scale over which the atomic state changes , and the atomic density operator satisfies a markovian master equation .",
    "this results in the irreversible decay of excited atomic state populations , though with a decay rate different to that for radiative decay in free space",
    ". this regime is characterised by a weak coupling between the atom and the em  field . on the other hand ,",
    "if the reservoir structure functions vary rapidly with mode frequency , the corresponding reservoir correlation time may be long compared to the time scale over which the atomic state changes , and the atomic density operator no longer satisfies a markovian master equation . a reversible oscillatory decay of excited atomic state populations results , with a period related to the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "this regime is characterised by a strong coupling between the atom and the emfield .",
    "there are a large variety of effects associated with atoms in structured em fields , including modifications to the spontaneous emission , fluorescence and probe absorption spectra , and comprehensive surveys may be found in several reviews , for example @xcite . amongst the many effects",
    "is the modification of the spectrum of the radiation emitted when an excited atom decays into initially empty field modes .",
    "it has been known from the early days of quantum optics that for an initially excited two - level atom ( tla ) in free space , this so - called spontaneous emission ( se ) spectrum is a lorentzian centred around the atomic transition frequency and with a width given by the excited atom decay rate @xcite . in the weak coupling regime",
    "the spectrum will remain lorentzian , but with a modified width reflecting the changed atomic decay rate .",
    "the situation changes qualitatively for the strong coupling regime , with the spectrum no longer remaining lorentzian .",
    "the essential physics for a tla coupled to a single mode cavity in the strong coupling regime can be described via the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , where the energy eigenstates allowing for the atom - cavity mode coupling are the so - called dressed atom states @xcite .",
    "the first calculation for the se spectrum for a tla in an ideal lossless cavity was carried out by sanchez - mondragon et al .",
    "@xcite . using a heisenberg equation of motion approach and determining the spectrum from the two - time correlation function for the atomic dipole operator",
    ", they found a double peaked spectrum with a separation between peaks given by the so - called one - photon rabi frequency , that is the rabi frequency associated with one photon in the cavity mode .",
    "line shapes were associated with the spectrometer bandwidth @xcite , since no cavity bandwidth was included .",
    "another early calculation for a tla in a high - q cavity was that of agarwal @xcite , who used the dressed atom model to predict the se and weak probe absorption spectra .",
    "this article determines the se  spectrum for different positions of the spectrometer , the spectrum associated with sideways emission via direct se  being given in terms of the two - time dipole correlation function , whilst the spectrum associated with end emission via the cavity output mirror is given in terms of the two - time correlation function for cavity creation and annihilation operators .",
    "although qualitatively similar in exhibiting vacuum rabi frequency splitting , the spectra are quantitatively different .",
    "the se spectra shown had lineshapes determined for the situation where the spectrometer bandwidth was large compared to the cavity decay rate .",
    "non - lorentzian se spectra were also found by lewenstein et al .",
    "@xcite for emission from a tla into both high q cavities and pbg systems , here an essential states approach was used and the spectrum defined in terms of the long time probability for finding one photon in a cavity or background mode . using a master equation and quantum regression theorem @xcite approach , carmichael et al .",
    "carmichael89a took into account both cavity damping and spontaneous emission damping to determine the side emission se spectrum for a tla  in a high - q cavity from the two - time dipole correlation function , based on a zero bandwidth spectrometer .",
    "further discussion and references on the theory of the se  spectrum for a tla in a high - q cavity are given by childs et al .",
    "childs94a and carmichael et al .",
    "@xcite in the review berman94a .",
    "no _ direct _ experimental measurements of the se  spectrum for a single tla in a high - q cavity appear to have been carried out .",
    "however there are related experiments in the strong coupling regime , such as on the absorption spectrum for a weak probe field that demonstrates single atom vacuum rabi splitting @xcite , or single atom rabi oscillations brune96a , or the collapse and revival experiments with a single tla  rempe87a that demonstrate cavity mode quantization eberly80a , barnett86a .",
    "all these measurements can be interpreted in terms of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite and the associated dressed atom states @xcite .",
    "the direct measurement of sespectra would probably only be possible in the optical regime , since se in the microwave regime would be too weak to detect . for the case of a single tla in a high - q cavity or a pbg system",
    "which is also coupled to a strong laser field , there is an extensive literature dealing with the related spectra , in particular the spectra associated with resonance fluorescence or probe absorption .",
    "the work of mollow @xcite for the free space situation predicted a three - peaked ( ac stark effect ) fluorescence spectrum , and a dispersion - like probe absorption spectrum .",
    "for a tla in an ideal lossless cavity in a coherent state agarwal et al .",
    "@xcite predicted a large number of spectral lines in the fluorescence spectra , reflecting the contributions from the numerous dressed atom states involved .",
    "these spectra can also be interpreted via the dressed atom model , see the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of the se  spectrum for a tla in a high - q cavity or a pbg system , the case of three level atoms ( 3la ) has received little attention .",
    "the se spectrum for a 3la in a lambda configuration in a pbg system has been treated by john et al .",
    "@xcite via the essential states approach for various detunings from the band gap edge , the spectrum ( which shows doublet and window effects ) being defined via the photon emission probability .",
    "ashraf @xcite determined the se spectrum for a 3la in a lambda configuration in an ideal lossless cavity using the dressed states approach , the spectrum ( which shows a doublet structure reflecting the one photon rabi frequency ) being given via the two - time dipole correlation function .",
    "line shapes were due to the spectrometer bandwidth . for a 3la in a cascade configuration in a pbg system , bay et al .",
    "@xcite used the essential states approach to determine the sespectrum for various detunings of one of the atomic transitions from the band gap edge , the latter ( which is strongly non - lorentzian ) being defined via the photon emission probability .",
    "the treatment applies when the two atomic frequencies are quite distinct , enabling only one at a time to interact strongly with the pbg .",
    "paspalakis et al .",
    "@xcite treated the case of se from a 3la in a lambda configuration in a pbg system , using the same approach and spectrum definition as @xcite .",
    "similar spectral features were found , including the window not previously noted by john et al .",
    "the case of a 3la in a cascade configuration in an ideal lossless cavity has been studied by zhou et al .  @xcite using a dressed atom approach and both end and side se",
    "spectra were determined .",
    "line shapes were due to the spectrometer bandwidth , as no cavity damping was included .",
    "the cavity mode was resonant with the average of the atomic transition frequencies .",
    "for the situation where the two atomic transition frequencies were equal , six peaks were found in both the side emission and end emission se spectra , though in the latter case two of these were negligible .",
    "when the two atomic transition frequencies differed , there were eight peaks in the side emission spectrum .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we have considered the non - markovian decay of a three level cascade atom with both transitions coupled to a single structured reservoir of quantized field modes for both a high - q cavity and in a pbg system . based on the approach given in @xcite",
    "the dynamics of this system has been treated via the essential states approach , using laplace transform methods applied to the coupled amplitude equations .",
    "non - markovian behaviour for the population dynamics of the atomic system was found , such as oscillatory decay for the high - q cavity case and population trapping for the photonic band - gap case .",
    "a markovian master equation approach was also applied , in which the atomic system was augmented by a small number of discrete quasimodes or pseudomodes , which in the quasimode treatment themselves undergo markovian relaxation into a flat reservoir of continuum quasimodes .",
    "for the high - q cavity case a single discrete quasimode was involved , for the pbg case two coupled discrete quasimodes were needed .",
    "the essential states and markoff methods gave identical results , showing that complicated non - markovian behaviour can be treated by enlarging the non - markovian system , thereby turning a non - markovian problem into a markovian one .",
    "in the present paper we now consider the se  spectrum for the case of a cascade atom in a high - q cavity .",
    "the spectrum is much richer than for the tla case and quantum interference effects may now occur .",
    "quantum coherence and interference phenomena are central in many applications of fundamental quantum optics results , and a comprehensive review of such effects may be found in a special issue of this journal on quantum inteference @xcite . unlike previous work",
    ", we will consider the case of an ideal spectrometer with zero bandwidth in order to display the actual se  spectral line shapes without these being masked by instrumental effects .",
    "a master equation approach incorporating cavity decay will be used to evaluate the spectra via the quantum regression theorem .",
    "both end ( case a(b ) ) and side ( case c ) se spectra will be calculated , and we aim to exhibit the expected quantum interference effects that can occur in a cascade system .",
    "we will show that the spectrum in both cases are given in terms of the laplace transforms of both the atom - cavity mode density matrix elements and the evolution operator matrix elements .    before developing the mathematical formalism it may be useful to consider the physical processes that can be involved in the decay of the cascade atom in a high - q cavity and the registration of a photon arrival in a suitable detector ",
    "this will enable possible interference effects to be identified .",
    "in a cascade atom initially in its upper state @xmath0 and coupled to a high q cavity empty of photons , two photons can be emitted before the atom makes a transition to its lowest state @xmath1 via the intermediate state @xmath2 .",
    "if there is a detector atom weakly coupled to the atom - cavity mode system and prepared in its lower state @xmath3 , the detector atom could absorb one of these photons and make a transition to its upper state @xmath4 .",
    "following the approach of glauber glauber65a the overall transition probability for the @xmath5 process considered as a function of the detector atom transition frequency @xmath6 may be used for an operational definition of the spontaneous emission spectrum for this cascade atom in a high q cavity  the cavity mode being coupled to empty external modes via the cavity mirror . since the detector atom is only",
    "weakly coupled we need only consider processes with a single @xmath5 transition . also , steps where a photon is created in an external mode would not be reversible .",
    "on the other hand if the atom - cavity mode coupling is strong , atomic transitions accompanied by photon number changes in the cavity mode may be reversible . if we consider the case ( _ case a _ ) where the detector atom is placed inside the cavity , then the photon causing the detector atom transition must have come from the cavity mode .",
    "however photons in the cavity mode can also be transferred to an external mode via loss through the cavity mirror , and if one photon is used to cause the @xmath5 transition in the detector atom , the other will be transferred to an external mode .",
    "we consider states of the combined detector atom , cavity mode , cascade atom , external mode system of the product form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 specify the detector atom state , the cavity photon number , the atomic state and the photon number for a specific external mode respectively .",
    "then the overall process in which the cascade atom changes from upper state @xmath12 to lowest state @xmath13 , the detector atom changes from lower state @xmath3 to upper state @xmath4 and one photon appears in a specific external mode , whilst the cavity mode is initially and finally empty of photons is denoted @xmath14 .",
    "however this overall process involving the overall emission of two photons ( one being absorbed by the detector atom , the other appearing in an external mode ) has a number of different quantum pathways :    @xmath15    reversible atom - cavity mode transitions are designated @xmath16 , irreversible cavity - external mode transitions @xmath17 and weak detector atom transitions @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , each of the reversible steps in the above pathways may involve further pathways if the atom - cavity mode coupling is strong .",
    "for example , the first pathway @xmath19could branch into two different sub - pathways @xmath20    the possibilities for branching are endless .",
    "the transition amplitudes for all these different pathways ( and sub - pathways ) are added to form the overall transition amplitude , and hence the transition probability would be expected to exhibit quantum interference effects . thus the spontaneous emission spectrum for a three level cascade atom should demonstrate interesting interference phenomena .",
    "of course there will also be a detection processes in which the cascade atom changes from upper state @xmath0 to intermediate state @xmath21 , the detector atom changes from lower state @xmath22 to upper state @xmath23 but no photon appears in a specific external mode , whilst the cavity mode is initially and finally empty of photons .",
    "this is denoted @xmath24 and involves only one photon emission , the emitted photon being absorbed by the detector atom .",
    "here @xmath25is the only quantum pathway , though again there are numerous sub - pathways such as    @xmath26    if the atom - cavity mode coupling is strong .",
    "for this overall process there still may be quantum interference effects .",
    "similar processes to these would apply if the only atomic states considered were @xmath0  and @xmath2 , with the coupling to the lower state @xmath27  being set to zero , and sub - pathways involving @xmath27 excluded . in all these cases the amplitudes for different sub - pathways would combine to produce",
    "an overall transition amplitude , and hence interference effects giving maxima and minima in the detection probability ( spectrum ) could occur . whether these interference effects can be be demonstrated directly via altering the system coupling constants , detunings etc .",
    "is a separate issue .",
    "a similar discussion can be presented for the case where the detector atom is placed just outside the cavity mirror ( _ case b _ ) to detect end emission , or where the detector atom is placed outside the cavity to detect the weak side emission ( _ case c _ ) . in case b it is the external mode photon absorption that is associated with the detector atom transition , in case c it is the transition in the cascade atom itself , so the details of the discussion will differ for these two cases .    in section [ section 2 ]",
    "the general features of the quasimode description used to treat the cascade atom - cavity mode system are covered , along with a brief outline of the approach for defining the spectrum and how the quantum regression theorem is used in the calculations .",
    "section [ section 3 ] covers the master equation for the cascade atom - cavity mode system , the related evolution operator and their determination in terms of laplace transforms .",

    "b the detector atom was exposed to the field emerging from a partially transmitting cavity mirror . in case",
    "c the detector atom responded to sideways emission from the cascade atom inside the cavity .",
    "the cascade atom was initially in its uppermost level and the cavity mode empty of photons , and thus a system with two basic excitations was studied .",
    "the spectrum was found from the weakly coupled detector atom response and involved in each case laplace transforms of the density matrix and matrix elements of the evolution operator in a super - operator form .",
    "the spectral line - shapes only reflect cavity decay , since the weakly coupled detector atom spectrometer had zero bandwidth .",
    "spectra have been presented for intermediate and strong coupling regime situations where both atomic transitions are resonant with the cavity frequency , for cases of non - zero cavity detuning and for cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ .",
    "the spectra for case a and case b were found to be essentially the same .",
    "the spectral features for cases b(a ) and c were qualitatively similar , with six spectral peaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases .",
    "these general features of the spectra could be explained via the dressed atom model .",
    "however , case b(a ) and case c spectra differed in detail .",
    "in particular , the spectra for case c exhibited a deep spectral hole when the spectral frequency was equal to the cavity mode frequency , a feature that persisted , for strong coupling , over a wide range of detuning and coupling conditions .",
    "however , this spectral hole was absent for case a , a feature that can not yet be explained . the spectral hole in case c was particularly prominent for resonance conditions , when both atomic transition frequencies were the same and resonant with the cavity frequency . in this resonance situation , photons associated with the middle to bottom",
    "dressed atom transitions coincide in frequency with photons associated with two of the upper to middle dressed atom transitions , and therefore the origin of a photon detected in the spectrometer can not be identified .",
    "this suggests that an interference effect is occuring , and this is confirmed by showing that the hole disappears when only the upper to middle dressed atom transitions are present .",
    "however , why the interference hole is absent in case b(a ) spectra is still unclear .",
    "one clue is that the spectral hole in case c spectra disappeared in figure [ figure11 ] when the atomic transition frequencies were quite different and the cavity frequency was resonant with the lower atomic transition frequency .",
    "this disappearance was sensitive to both the detunings having opposite sign and a magnitude close to @xmath439 .",
