    "while the origin of the idea to investigate quantum mechanics of particles confined to a graph was conceived originally to address to a particular physical problem , namely the spectra of aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite , the motivation was quickly lost and for a long time the problem remained rather an obscure textbook example .",
    "this changed in the last two decades when the progress of microfabrication techniques made graph - shaped structures of submicron sizes technologically important .",
    "this generated an intense interest to investigation of quantum graph models which went beyond the needs of practical applications , since these models proved to be an excellent laboratory to study various properties of quantum systems .",
    "the literature on quantum graphs is nowadays huge ; we limit ourselves to mentioning the recent volume @xcite where many concepts are discussed and a rich bibliography can be found .",
    "the essential component of quantum graph models is the wavefunction coupling in the vertices . while often the most simple matching conditions ( dubbed free , kirchhoff , or neumann ) or the slightly more general @xmath0 coupling in which the functions are continuous in the vertex are used , these cases represent just a tiny subset of all admissible couplings . the family of the latter is determined by the requirement that the corresponding hamiltonian is a self - adjoint operator , or in physical language , that the probability current is conserved at the vertices .",
    "it is not difficult to find all the admissible conditions mathematically ; if the vertex joins @xmath1 edges they contain @xmath2 free parameters , and with exception of the one - parameter subfamily mentioned above they are all singular in the sense that the wavefunctions are discontinuous at the vertex .",
    "what is much less clear is the physical meaning of such conditions .",
    "it is longstanding open problem whether and in what sense one can approximate all the singular couplings by regular ones depending on suitable parameters , and the aim of the present paper is to answer this question by presenting such a construction , minimal in a natural sense using @xmath2 real parameters , and to show that the closeness is achieved in the norm - resolvent sense , so the convergence of all types of the spectra and the corresponding eigenprojections is guaranteed .",
    "the key idea comes from a paper of one of us with shigehara @xcite which showed that a combination of regular point interactions on a line approaching each other with the coupling scaled in a particular way w.r.t .",
    "the interaction distance can produce a singular point interaction .",
    "later it was demonstrated @xcite that the convergence in this model is norm - resolvent and the scaling choice is highly non - generic .",
    "the idea was applied by two of us to the simplest singular coupling , the so - called @xmath3 , in @xcite and was demonstrated to work ; the question was how much it can be extended .",
    "two other of us examined it @xcite and found that with a larger number of regular interactions one can deal with families described by @xmath4 parameters , and changing locally the approximating graph topology one can deal with all the couplings invariant with respect to the time reversal which form an @xmath5-parameter subset .",
    "it was clear that to proceed beyond the time - reversal symmetry one has to involve vector potentials similarly as it is was done in the simplest situation in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present such a construction which contains parameters breaking the symmetry and which at the same time is more elegant than that of @xcite in the sense that the needed `` ornamentation '' of the graph is minimal : we disconnect the @xmath1 edges at the vertex and join each pair of the so obtained free ends by an additional edge which shrinks to a point in the limit .",
    "the number of parameters leans on the decomposition @xmath6 , where the first summand , @xmath1 , corresponds to @xmath0 couplings of the `` outer '' edge endpoints with those of the added shrinking ones .",
    "the second summand can be considered as @xmath7 times two parameters : one is a @xmath0 potential placed at the edge , the other is a vector potential supported by it .",
    "our result shows that any singular vertex coupling can be approximated by a graph in which the vertex is replaced by a local graph structure in combination with local regular interactions and local magnetic fields .",
    "this opens way to constructing `` structured '' vertices tailored to the desired conductivity properties , even tunable ones , if the interactions are controlled by gate electrodes , however , we are not going to elaborate such approximations further in this paper .",
    "we have to note for completeness that the problem of understanding vertex couplings has also other aspects .",
    "the approximating object needs not to be a graph but can be another geometrical structure .",
    "a lot of attention was paid to the situation of `` fat graphs '' , or networks of this tubes built around the graph skeleton .",
    "the two approaches can be combined , for instance , by `` lifting '' the graph results to fat graphs . in this way approximations",
    "to @xmath0 and @xmath3 couplings by suitable families of schrdinger operators on such manifolds with neumann boundaries were recently demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper can be similarly `` lifted '' to manifolds ; that will be the subject of a subsequent work .",
    "let us review briefly the contents of the paper .",
    "in the next section we gather the needed preliminary information .",
    "we review the information about vertex couplings and derive a new parametrization of a general coupling suitable for our purposes .",
    "in section  3 we describe in detail the approximation sketched briefly above and show that on a heuristic level it converges to a chosen vertex coupling . finally , in the last section we present and prove our main result showing that the said convergence is not only formal but it is valid also in the norm - resolvent sense .",
    "let us first recall briefly a few basic notions ; for a more detailed discussion we refer to the literature given in the introduction .",
    "the object of our interest are schrdinger operators on metric graphs .",
    "a graph is conventionally identified with a family of vertices and edges ; it is metric if each edge can be equipped with a distance , i.e. to be identified with a finite or semi - infinite interval .",
    "we regard such a graph @xmath8 with edges @xmath9 as a configuration space of a quantum mechanical system , i.e. we identify the orthogonal sum @xmath10 with the state hilbert space and the wave function of a spinless particle `` living '' on @xmath8 can be written as the column @xmath11 with @xmath12 . in the simplest case",
    "when no external fields are present the system hamiltonian acts as @xmath13 , with the domain consisting of functions from @xmath14 .",
    "not all such functions are admissible , though , in order to make the operator self - adjoint we have to require that appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied at the vertices of the graph .",
    "we restrict our attention to the physically most interesting case when the boundary conditions are _ local _ , coupling values of the functions and derivatives is each vertex separately .",
    "our aim is explain the meaning of a general vertex coupling using suitable approximations ; the local character means that we can investigate how such a system behaves in the vicinity of a single vertex .",
    "a prototypical example of this situation is a _ star graph _ with one vertex in which a finite number of semi - infinite edges meet ; this is the case we will mostly have in mind in the following .",
    "let us thus consider a graph vertex @xmath15 of degree @xmath1 , i.e. with @xmath1 edges connected at @xmath15 .",
    "we denote these edges by @xmath16 and the components of the wave function values at them by @xmath17 .",
    "we choose the coordinates at the edges in such a way that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 , and the value @xmath20 corresponds to the vertex @xmath15 .",
    "for notational simplicity we put @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "since our hamiltonian is a second - order differential operator , the sought boundary conditions will couple the above boundary values , their most general form being @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are complex @xmath26 matrices .    to ensure self - adjointness of the hamiltonian , which is in physical terms equivalent to conservation of the probability current at the vertex @xmath15 , the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 can not be arbitrary but have to satisfy the following two conditions , @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the @xmath29 matrix with @xmath30 forming the first and the second @xmath1 columns , respectively , as stated for the first time by kostrykin and schrader @xcite . the relation together with conditions ( for brevity , we will write & )",
    "describe all possible vertex boundary conditions giving rise to a self - adjoint hamiltonian ; we will speak about _ admissible boundary conditions_.    on the other hand , it is obvious that the formulation & is non - unique in the sense that different pairs @xmath31 , @xmath32 may define the same vertex coupling , as @xmath30 can be equivalently replaced by @xmath33 for any regular matrix @xmath34 . to overcome this ambiguity ,",
    "harmer @xcite , and independently kostrykin and schrader @xcite proposed a unique form of the boundary conditions , namely @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a unitary @xmath26 matrix .",
    "note that in a more general context such conditions were known before @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the natural _ parametrization _ of the family of vertex couplings has several advantages in comparison to & , besides its uniqueness it also makes obvious how `` large '' the family is : since the unitary group @xmath37 has @xmath2 real parameters , the same is true for vertex couplings in a quantum graph vertex of the degree @xmath1 . of course",
    ", this fact is also clear if one interprets the couplings from the viewpoint of self - adjoint extensions @xcite .    on the other hand , among the disadvantages of the formulation one can mention its complexity : vertex couplings that are simple from the physical point of view may have a complicated description when expressed in terms of the condition . as an example , let us mention in the first place the @xmath0-coupling with a parameter @xmath38 , characterized by relations @xmath39 for which the matrix @xmath36 used in has entries given by @xmath40 @xmath41 being the kronecker delta .",
    "when we substitute into and compare with rewritten into a matrix form  , we observe that the first formulation is not only more complicated with respect to the latter , but also contains complex values whereas the latter does not .",
    "this is a reason why it is often better to work with simpler expressions of the type & .",
    "another aspect of this parametrization difference concerns the meaning of the parameters .",
    "since the @xmath2 ones mentioned earlier are `` encapsulated '' in a unitary matrix , it is difficult to understand which role each of them plays .    on the other hand , both formulations & and have a common feature , namely that they have a form insensitive to a particular edge numbering .",
    "if the edges are permuted one has just to replace the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath36 by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , obtained by the appropriate rearrangement of rows and columns .",
    "this may hide different ways in which the edges are coupled ; it is easy to see that a particular attention should be paid to `` singular '' situations when the matrix @xmath36 has eigenvalue(s ) equal to @xmath44 .",
    "since the type of the coupling will be important for the approximation we are going to construct , we will rewrite the vertex coupling conditions in another form which is again simple and unique but requires an appropriate edge numbering .",
    "this will be done in theorem  [ volneop ] , before stating it we introduce several symbols that will be employed in the further text , namely @xmath45 to be precise , let us remark that the term `` numbering '' with respect to the edges connected in the graph vertex of the degree @xmath1 means strictly numbering by the elements of the set @xmath46 .",
    "[ volneop ] let us consider a quantum graph vertex @xmath15 of the degree @xmath1 .",
    "* if @xmath47 , @xmath48 is a self - adjoint matrix and @xmath49 , then the equation @xmath50 expresses admissible boundary conditions .",
    "this statement holds true for any numbering of the edges .",
    "* for any vertex coupling there exist a number @xmath47 and a numbering of edges such that the coupling is described by the boundary conditions with the uniquely given matrices @xmath49 and self - adjoint @xmath48 . *",
    "consider a quantum graph vertex of the degree @xmath1 with the numbering of the edges explicitly given ; then there is a permutation @xmath51 such that the boundary conditions may be written in the modified form @xmath52 for @xmath53 where the self - adjoint matrix @xmath48 and the matrix @xmath49 depend unambiguously on @xmath54 .",
    "this formulation of boundary conditions is in general not unique , since there may be different admissible permutations @xmath54 , but one can make it unique by choosing the lexicographically smallest permutation @xmath54 .",
    "the claim ( iii ) is an immediate consequence of ( ii ) using a simultaneous permutation of elements in the vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so we have to prove the first two . as for ( i ) , we have to show that the vertex coupling   with matrices @xmath57 conform with .",
    "we have @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "the latter matrix is self - adjoint since @xmath60 , thus is satisfied .",
    "now we proceed to ( ii ) .",
    "consider a quantum graph vertex of the degree @xmath1 with an arbitrary fixed vertex coupling .",
    "let @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the vectors of values and derivatives of the wave function components at the edge ends ; the order of the components is arbitrary but fixed and the same for both vectors . we know that the coupling can be described by boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) with some @xmath61 satisfying  .",
    "our aim is to find a number @xmath47 , a certain numbering of the edges and matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that the boundary conditions   are equivalent to  .",
    "moreover , we have to show that such a number @xmath64 is the only possible and that @xmath65 depend uniquely on the edge numbering .",
    "when proceeding from to , we may use exclusively manipulations that do not affect the meaning of the coupling , namely    * simultaneous permutation of columns of the matrices @xmath30 combined with corresponding simultaneous permutation of components in @xmath55 and @xmath56 , * multiplying the system from left by a regular matrix .",
    "we see from that @xmath64 is equal to the rank of the matrix applied at @xmath56 .",
    "we observe that the rank of this matrix , as well as of that applied at @xmath55 , is not influences by any of the manipulations mentioned above , hence it is obvious that @xmath66 and that such a choice is the only possible , i.e. @xmath64 is unique .",
    "since @xmath67 with @xmath68 , there is an @xmath64-tuple of linearly independent columns of the matrix @xmath25 ; suppose that their indices are @xmath69 .",
    "we permute simultaneously the columns of @xmath25 and @xmath24 so that those with indices @xmath69 are now at the positions @xmath70 , and the same we do with the components of the vectors @xmath55 , @xmath56 . labelling the permuted matrices @xmath30 and vectors @xmath55 , @xmath56 with tildes , we get @xmath71 since @xmath72 , there are @xmath64 rows of @xmath73 that are linearly independent , let their indices be @xmath74 , and @xmath75 rows that are linear combinations of the preceding ones .",
    "first we permute the rows in   so that those with indices @xmath74 are put to the positions @xmath70 ; note that it corresponds to a matrix multiplication of the whole system   by a permutation matrix ( which is regular ) from the left , i.e. an authorized manipulation . in this way we pass from @xmath76 and @xmath73 to matrices which we denote as @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "; it is obvious that this operation keeps the first @xmath64 columns of the matrix @xmath78 linearly independent .    in the next step",
    "we add to each of the last @xmath75 rows of @xmath79 such a linear combination of the first @xmath64 rows that all the last @xmath75 rows of @xmath78 vanish .",
    "this is possible , because the last @xmath75 lines of @xmath78 are linearly dependent on the first @xmath64 lines .",
    "it is easy to see that it is an authorized operation , not changing the meaning of the boundary conditions ; the resulting matrices at the lhs will be denoted as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 from the construction described above we know that the matrix @xmath80 has a block form , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 ; the square matrix @xmath84 is regular , because its columns are linearly independent .",
    "we proceed by multiplying the system   from the left by the matrix @xmath86 arriving at boundary conditions @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "boundary conditions   are equivalent to , therefore they have to be admissible .",
    "in other words , the matrices @xmath89 and @xmath90 have to satisfy both the conditions  , which we are now going to verify .",
    "let us begin with the second one .",
    "we have @xmath91 and this matrix is self - adjoint if and only if @xmath92 is self adjoint and @xmath93 .",
    "we infer that @xmath94 , hence condition   acquires the form @xmath95 the first one of the conditions   says that @xmath96 hence @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 we obtain the condition @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 must be a regular matrix .",
    "it allows us to multiply the equation   from the left by the matrix @xmath101 which is obviously well - defined and regular ; this operation leads to the condition @xmath102 if follows from our previous considerations that the square matrix @xmath92 is self - adjoint .",
    "if we denote it as @xmath103 , rename the block @xmath104 as @xmath63 and transfer the term containing @xmath105 to the right hand side , we arrive at boundary conditions @xmath106 the order of components in @xmath107 and @xmath105 determines just the appropriate numbering , in other words , the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath105 represent exactly what we understood by @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the formulation of the theorem .",
    "finally , the uniqueness of the matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 with respect to the choice of the permutation @xmath54 is a consequence of the presence of the blocks @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "first of all , the block @xmath109 implies that there is only one possible @xmath63 , otherwise the conditions for @xmath110 would change , and next , the block @xmath108 together with the uniqueness of @xmath63 implies that there is only one possible @xmath62 , otherwise the conditions for @xmath111 would change .",
    "[ redukcepar ] the expression   implies , in particular , that if @xmath25 has not full rank , the number of real numbers parametrizing the vertex coupling   is reduced from @xmath2 to at most @xmath112 , where @xmath66 .",
    "another reduction can come from a lower rank of the matrix @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure of permuting columns and applying linear transformations to the rows of the system has been done with respect to the matrix @xmath25 , but one can start by same right from the matrix @xmath24 as well . in this way we would obtain similar boundary conditions as",
    ", only the vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 would be interchanged .",
    "theorem [ volneop ] can be thus formulated with equation replaced by @xmath113 for completeness sake we add that another possible forms of equation in theorem [ volneop ] are @xmath114 and @xmath115 having the standardized form @xmath116 , last two formulations may be sometimes more convenient than .",
    "+ obviously , an analogous remark applies to equation .",
    "a formulation of boundary conditions with a matrix structure singling out the regular part as in has been derived in a different way by p. kuchment @xcite .",
    "recall that in the setting analogous to ours he stated existence of an orthogonal projector @xmath117 in @xmath118 with the complementary projector @xmath119 and a self - adjoint operator @xmath120 in @xmath121 such that the boundary conditions may be written in the form @xmath122 let us briefly explain how p. kuchment s form differs from . when transformed into a matrix form ,",
    "consists of two groups of @xmath1 linearly dependent equations .",
    "if we then naturally extract a single group of @xmath1 linearly indepent ones , we arrive at a condition with a structure similar to , i. e. the upper right submatrix standing at @xmath56 is generally a _",
    "nonzero _ matrix @xmath123 . in other words ,",
    "whilst p. kuchment aimed to decompose the boundary conditions with respect to two complementary orthogonal projectors , our aim was to obtain a unique matrix form with as many vanishing terms as possible ; the form turned out to have a highly suitable structure for solving the problem of approximations that we are going to analyze in the rest of the paper .    to conclude this introductory section , let us summarize main advantages and disadvantages of the conditions and .",
    "they are unique and exhibit a simple and clear correspondence between the parameters of the coupling and the entries of matrices in , furthermore , the matrices in are relatively sparse . on the negative side , the structure of matrices in depends on @xmath124 and the vertex numbering is not fully permutable .",
    "we have argued above that due to a local character one can consider a single - vertex situation , i.e. star graph , when asking about the meaning of the vertex coupling . in this section",
    "we consider such a quantum graph with general matching conditions and show that the singular coupling may be understood as a limit case of certain family of graphs constructed only from edges connected by @xmath0-couplings , @xmath0-interactions , and supporting constant vector potentials .    following the above discussion",
    ", one may consider the boundary conditions of the form , renaming the edges if necessary .",
    "it turns out that for notational purposes it is advantageous to adopt the following convention on a shift of the column indices of @xmath63 :    [ indt ] the lines of the matrix @xmath63 are indexed from 1 to @xmath64 , the columns are indexed from @xmath125 to @xmath1 .",
    "now we can proceed to the description of our approximating model .",
    "consider a star graph with @xmath1 outgoing edges coupled in a general way given by the condition  .",
    "the approximation in question looks as follows ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) :    * we take @xmath1 halflines , each parametrized by @xmath126 , with the endpoints denoted as @xmath127 , and put a @xmath0-coupling ( to the edges specified below ) with the parameter @xmath128 at the point @xmath127 for all @xmath129 . *",
    "certain pairs @xmath130 of halfline endpoints will be joined by edges of the length @xmath131 , and the center of each such joining segment will be denoted as @xmath132 . for each pair",

    "* at each point @xmath132 we place a @xmath0 interaction with a parameter @xmath145 . from now on we use the following convention : the connecting edges of the length @xmath131 are considered as composed of two line segments of the length @xmath146 , on each of them the variable runs from 0 ( corresponding to the point @xmath132 ) to @xmath146 ( corresponding to the point @xmath127 or @xmath134 ) . * on each connecting segment described above we put a vector potential which is constant on the whole line between the points @xmath127 and @xmath134 .",
