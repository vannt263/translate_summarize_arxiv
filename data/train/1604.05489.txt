    "continuous random processes and fields are regularly applied to model temporal or spatial phenomena in many different fields of science such as agriculture , chemistry , econometrics , finance , geology or physics .",
    "model fitting is usually done with the help of data obtained by observing the given process at various time points or spatial locations .",
    "these observations are either used for parameter estimation or for prediction . however , the results highly depend on the choice of the data collection points . starting with the fundamental works of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a lot of work has been done in the field of optimal design . here by a design we mean a set  @xmath0  of distinct time points or locations where the investigated process is observed , whereas optimality refers to some prespecified criterion @xcite .",
    "in case of prediction , one can use , e.g. , the integrated mean square prediction error criterion , which minimizes a functional of the error of the kriging predictor @xcite or maximize the entropy of observations @xcite . in parameter estimation problems , a popular approach is to consider information based criteria .",
    "an a - optimal design minimizes the trace of the inverse of the fisher information matrix ( fim ) on the unknown parameters , whereas e- , t- and d- optimal designs maximize the smallest eigenvalue , the trace and the determinant of the fim , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter design criterion for regression experiments has been studied by several authors both in uncorrelated ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and in correlated setups @xcite .",
    "however , there are several situations when d - optimal designs do not exist , for instance , if one has to estimate the covariance parameter(s ) of an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process @xcite or sheet @xcite .",
    "this deficiency can obviously be corrected by choosing a more appropriate design criterion . in case of regression models a recently introduced approach , which optimizes the condition number of the fim , called k - optimal design @xcite ,",
    "might be a reasonable choice .",
    "k - optimal designs try to minimize the error sensitivity of experimental measurements @xcite resulting in more reliable least squares estimates of the parameters .",
    "however , one can also consider the condition number of the fim as a measure of collinearity @xcite , thus minimizing the condition number avoids multicollinearity .",
    "in contrast to the standard information based design criteria , the condition number ( and the corresponding optimization problem ) is not convex , only quasiconvexity holds @xcite .",
    "hence , finding a k - optimal design usually requires non - smooth algorithms . @xcite",
    "consider polynomial regression models and solve the k - optimal design problem with nonlinear programming , whereas in @xcite simulated annealing is applied . in this class of models",
    "k - optimal designs are quite similar to their a - optimal counterparts .",
    "further , @xcite investigate chebyshev polynomial models and suggest a two - step approach to find a probability distribution approximating the k - optimal design .",
    "further , one should also mention that k - optimal design is invariant to the multiplication of the fim by a scalar , so it does not measure the amount of information on the unknown parameters . besides this , k - optimality obviously does not have meaning for one - parameter models , but in this case multicollinearity does not appear either .",
    "all regression models where k - optimality has been investigated so far consider uncorrelated errors , but there are no results for correlated processes . in the present paper",
    "we derive k - optimal designs for estimating the regression parameters of simple temporal and spatial linear models driven by ou processes and sheets , respectively , and compare the obtained sampling schemes with the corresponding d - optimal designs .",
    "both increasing domain and infill equidistant designs are investigated and the key differences between the two approaches are highlighted . our aim is to give a first insight into the behaviour of k - optimal designs in a correlated setup , but many results presented here can be generalized to models with different base functions and/or correlation structures ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a natural direction for further research .",
