    "the hecke algebras of complex reflection groups can be seen as natural deformations of complex reflection groups . in particular",
    "they both generalize the hecke algebras of type @xmath0 ( deforming the symmetric groups ) and the hecke algebras of type @xmath1 ( deforming the hyperoctohedral groups ) .",
    "the representation theory of these algebras has been well studied during the last past decades .",
    "it appears to be quite deep and related to the representation theory of various important algebraic objects ( such as the quantum affine algebras , the quiver - hecke algebras or the rational cherednik algebras . ) in type @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a motivation for studying these representations comes from the representation theory of finite reductive groups where these hecke algebras appear as endomorphism algebras of permutation representations .",
    "recently , a question on the combinatorial representation theory of these algebras has been asked in a work of meinolf geck on the steinberg representation of a finite reductive group @xmath2 of `` classical type '' over a field @xmath3 @xcite . in the case",
    "where @xmath41_l=0 $ ] ( where @xmath1 is the borel subalgebra of @xmath2 ) , this remarkable representation of @xmath2 is reducible in general but one can show that its socle is simple . using the so called `` green correspondence '' , meinolf geck has shown that one can identify this socle with the sign representation of the hecke algebra ( associated to the datum of @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) at a root of @xmath5 .",
    "now , a classification of the simple modules for these algebras is available .",
    "as the sign representation is one dimensional and thus irreducible , the question of describing the above socle reduces to the problem of finding the precise labeling of the sign representation in terms of the known classification .",
    "the aim of this work is to give , more generally , a complete description of all the one dimensional representations in the wider context of the hecke algebra of the complex reflection group @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this algebra ( also known as ariki - koike algebra ) is defined as follows .",

    "the specialized @xmath31-modules @xmath32 are non semisimple in general .    in this case , a reduction theorem by dipper and mathas asserts that it is sufficient to consider the following case to understand the representation theory of our algebra ( in the sense that knowing the labelings , the dimensions and the characters of the simple modules in this case is sufficient to know them in general ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a primitive @xmath35-root of @xmath5 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "now , it is known , since the works of lascoux , leclerc , thibon and ariki , that a part of the representation theory of ariki - koike algebras is controlled by the quantum affine algebra in affine type @xmath0 and its action on the fock space .",
    "this approach allows a natural labeling of the simple modules by a certain subset of @xmath12-partitions @xmath38 known as the `` uglov @xmath12-partitions '' : @xmath39",
