    "@xcite for an introduction and overview ) . in the following",
    "we will outline some recent developments in devising a renormalization scheme leading to a simple and consistent power counting for the renormalized diagrams of a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach to baryon chpt @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian relevant to the one - nucleon sector consists of the sum of the purely mesonic and @xmath1 lagrangians , respectively , @xmath2 which are organized in a derivative and quark - mass expansion @xcite .",
    "for example , the lowest - order basic lagrangian @xmath3 , already expressed in terms of renormalized parameters and fields , is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote the chiral limit of the physical nucleon mass , the axial - vector coupling constant , and the pion - decay constant , respectively",
    ". the ellipsis refers to terms containing external fields and higher powers of the pion fields .",
    "when studying higher orders in perturbation theory one encounters ultraviolet divergences . as a preliminary step , the loop integrals are regularized , typically by means of dimensional regularization . for example , the simplest dimensionally regularized integral relevant to chpt is given by @xmath8+o(n-4),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 - 1 $ ] approaches infinity as @xmath10 .",
    "the t hooft parameter @xmath11 is responsible for the fact that the integral has the same dimension for arbitrary @xmath12 . in the process of renormalization",
    "the counter terms are adjusted such that they absorb all the ultraviolet divergences occurring in the calculation of loop diagrams .",
    "this will be possible , because we include in the lagrangian all of the infinite number of interactions allowed by symmetries @xcite . at the end",
    "the regularization is removed by taking the limit @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , when renormalizing , we still have the freedom of choosing a renormalization prescription . in this context",
    "we will adjust the finite pieces of the renormalized couplings such that renormalized diagrams satisfy the following power counting : a loop integration in @xmath12 dimensions counts as @xmath13 , pion and fermion propagators count as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , vertices derived from @xmath16 and @xmath17 count as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath20 collectively stands for a small quantity such as the pion mass , small external four - momenta of the pion , and small external three - momenta of the nucleon .",
