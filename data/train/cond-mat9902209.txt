    "fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) is a random process with stationary self - similar increments , which are normally distributed and have an infinite span of interdependence .",
    "the general theory of random processes with stationary self - similar increments was developed by kolmogorov @xcite as far back as 1940 .",
    "fractional brownian motions were introduced by mandelbrot and van ness as a ( relatively ) simple family of random functions  that could in some way be expected to be  typical  of what happens in the absence of asymptotic independence ",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors also have introduced fractional gaussian noise , that is , the stationary process , which is the derivative of the  smoothed  fbm .",
    "three classes of examples have moved these authors to study fractional motions , namely , ( i ) various economic time series , ( ii ) @xmath1 , or flicker , noises in electronics and solid state physics , and ( iii ) the tasks of hydrology , see references in @xcite . over past 30 years",
    "the usefulness of fbm s was confirmed repeatedly , and the number of phenomena , which can be viewed as examples of fbm s grows .",
    "there are many papers on this subject ; here we only mention the monograph @xcite , which contains a lot of natural examples , the review @xcite , which deals with the problems of biology and physiology , and the recent monograph @xcite , in which statistical properties of economical and financial time series are discussed .",
    "we also that the description of fractional noises in terms of probability densities requires the use of fractional calculus , which has an ever growing interest among physicists and economists @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of fbm s has posed the task of developing approximations , which allow one to simulate fbm s and study their properties in order to develop effective methods for experimental data processing and for the purposes of numerical modelling . soon after the first paper on fbm @xcite mandelbrot and wallis have carried out simulation experiments concerning fractional gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "they have proposed two approximations to the noise called  types 1 and 2 approximations  .",
    "later on , voss have proposed an empirical algorithm @xcite suited for construction of not only one - dimensional fractional brownian functions but also fractional brownian surfaces and volumes .",
    "however , we believe , that the ways of constructing fractional noises and motions are not exhausted , and various simulation models are needed , each of them may appear to be useful when studying some particular problem .    in this paper we propose a simple model of fbm based on exploitation of spectral properties of fractional gaussian noise .",
    "at first we remind some features , which are essential for our simulation and studies .",
    "below we use the same notations as in original papers by mandelbrot and van ness @xcite and by mandelbrot and wallis @xcite . an ordinary brownian motion with zero mean and unit variance",
    "is denoted by @xmath2 , and fbm by @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is constructed as a moving average of @xmath4 , in which past increments of @xmath5 are weighted by the kernel @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a parameter satisfying @xmath8 . for the ordinary brownian motion @xmath9 . for @xmath7 lying between 0.5 and 1 the process is called persistent , whereas for @xmath7 lying between 0 and 0.5 it is called anti - persistent . the introduction of fbm is motivated by the self - similar properties of its increments , which lead to the ",
    "@xmath0 laws  for the structure function and for the range , that is , @xmath10 ( an explicit form of @xmath11 is unessential here ) , and @xmath12 -   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\",
    "-\\inf_{t\\leq s\\leq t+\\tau } \\left [ b_h(s)-b_h(t)\\right ] \\stackrel{d}{= } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\stackrel{d}{=}r(0,\\tau ) \\stackrel{d}{=}\\tau ^hr(0,1 )",
    ".   \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the properties of self - similarity of approximation to fbm will be checked below .",
    "it is known that the sample paths of fbm are nowhere differentiable .",
    "such irregular functions are best characterized by the holder exponent or by recently introduced local fractional derivative @xcite . for the purposes of our paper we note that in applications one always deals with the  smoothed  random process , @xmath13 , which may be defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the smallest time interval , which is physically relevant for the problem of interest .",
    "@xmath13 has a derivative , @xmath16 ,   \\label{4}\\ ] ] which is called fractional gaussian noise .",
    "it is a stationary process with the covariance , which may be easily determined , @xmath17 if @xmath18 , it follows from eq.(5 ) that @xmath19 and thus , the covariance has the same sign as @xmath20 and has a very different behavior in a persistent case and in anti - persistent one .",
    "the analysis of eqs.(5 ) , ( 6 ) shows that for the former case @xmath21 is positive for all @xmath22 , and @xmath23 whereas for the latter @xmath21 changes sign once from positive to negative at a value of @xmath22 proportional to @xmath24 , and one has @xmath25 the next property , which serves as the basic one at the initial stage of our simulation , is a power - law behavior of the spectrum of fractional gaussian noise , @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "the spectrum ( 7 ) is also quite different for persistent and anti - persistent cases . for the former the main part of the noise energy",
    "is concentrated in a low -frequency region , whereas for the latter the spectral intensity grows towards high frequencies .    in numerical simulation one",
    "deals with a discrete - time fractional noise , when @xmath28 is a positive integer and the noise is defined by the sequence of increments @xmath29 .",
    "the correlation function is defined by eq.(5 ) with @xmath30 .",
    "the fourier transform of the discrete - time noise is defined between plus and minus the nyquist critical frequency @xmath31    the power - law dependence of the spectrum at small @xmath32 allows one to simulate fractional gaussian noise by fractional integration / differentiation of a white noise , with a subsequent construction of fbm .",
    "we remind the relation between the fourier transforms of the function @xmath33 and of its fractional integral / derivative @xmath34 of the @xmath35 order : @xmath36 where @xmath35 is positive in case of fractional integration and negative in case of fractional differentiation ( to be more accurate , we say about left - side liouville fractional integral / derivative on the infinite axis @xcite ) . if @xmath33 is a white gaussian noise , then the spectral density of @xmath34 is , at least , formally , @xmath37 which behaves as the spectrum of fractional gaussian noise at small @xmath32 , see eq.(7 ) , if we set @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we use the following way for simulation :    \\(i ) taking white gaussian noise @xmath33 , @xmath28 is an integer , we multiply its fourier transform by @xmath39 , @xmath40    \\(ii ) making an inverse fourier transform , we get @xmath34 , which is supposed to approximate fractional gaussian noise with the index @xmath41 .",
    "\\(iii ) the process @xmath42 , which is supposed to approximate fbm , is defined by @xmath43",
    "the results of numerical simulation and analysis are shown in figs.1 - 5 .    at the left of fig.1",
    "we show typical examples of the samples of the process @xmath44 for ( a ) @xmath45 , ( b ) @xmath46(white gaussian noise ) , and ( c ) @xmath47.the stationarity of the samples was checked by the methods of series and inversions @xcite .",
    "the figures demonstrate clearly the prevalence of low - frequency components for the case ( a ) , and the prevalence of high - frequency components for the case ( c ) . at the right of fig.1",
    "the solid lines depict normalized theoretical correlation functions , see eq.(5 ) , with @xmath30 , for ( a ) @xmath48 , ( b ) @xmath49 , and ( c ) @xmath50 , whereas the normalized correlation functions @xmath51 are shown by black points for the same values of as at the left of the figure .",
    "the results demonstrate good agreement between correlation function of simulated process with the parameter @xmath35 and theoretical correlation function for the fractional noise with the corresponding index @xmath52 .",
    "we also see clear difference between correlation functions for the persistent and anti - persistent cases .",
    "this difference is the manifestation of the property , which at a qualitative level can be formulated as follows : in the persistent random process the available tendency is supported , whereas in the anti - persistent process the opposite tendency prevails @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also note that the correlation functions indicated by black points are estimated from the samples shown at the left with the use of time averaging .",
    "the complementary averaging over a set of realizations diminishes scattering of the points .",
    "it is known , that the wavelet transform is well - suited for analyzing structure of non - stationary processes @xcite . in particular , it allows one to study the behavior of processes at different scales and hence it is sometimes called as a mathematical microscope .",
    "the wavelet transform @xmath53 of the process @xmath42 is written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is called analyzing wavelet . in fig.2",
    "we demonstrate the wavelet transforms @xmath56 of the samples of @xmath42 for ( a ) @xmath57 , and ( b ) @xmath58 .",
    "we use the ",
    "mexican hat  as analyzing wavelet , @xmath59 the low part of the wavelet corresponds to small @xmath60 values ( that is , to high frequencies ) , whereas the upper part corresponds to large @xmath60 values ( low frequencies).below each of the wavelet the sample path is shown , which is subjected to wavelet transform .",
    "it is seen that the wavelet for anti - persistent case has a clearly visualized structure in a high - frequency region . on the contrary ,",
    "the wavelet for persistent case demonstrate almost homogeneous background in a high - frequency region .",
    "the lines of local maxima demonstrate hierarchial structure , which reflects self - similarity of fbm .    in this paper we do not intend to use wavelets for extracting quantitative characteristics ,",
    "so , fig.2 has an illustrative purpose only .",
    "however , we note that the wavelet transform being applied to some known functions allows one to establish their multifractality @xcite .",
    "we study numerically @xmath22-dependence of the structure function of the generated process @xmath42 , @xmath61 since for fbm the  @xmath0 law ",
    "is fulfilled , see eq.(1 ) , we expect that @xmath62 is close to @xmath63 . in fig.3 @xmath62 depending on @xmath35",
    "is depicted by points for the persistent processes and by crosses for the anti - persistent ones .",
    "the expected relation is indicated by dotted line .",
    "we see that the numerical relation is well fitted by the expected line , however , some discrepancies appear for the strongly persistent and strongly anti - persistent processes as well . at the insets",
    "the structure function versus time delay @xmath22 is indicated by black points in log - log scale .",
    "the slopes of fitted lines give the values of @xmath62 for @xmath58 ( top inset ) and @xmath45 ( bottom inset ) , respectively .",
    "we now turn to the study of the range of @xmath42 . in the empirical rescaled range analysis ,",
    "that is , at experimental data processing or in numerical simulation the range of the random process is divided by the standard deviation of its increments after subtraction of a linear trend , see ref .",
    "this procedure , in particular , smooths the variations of the range on different segments of time series . as the result of the empirical rescaled range analysis of experimental data",
    "one gets the hurst exponent of the process . for fbm",
    "the hurst exponent thus obtained must coincide with the parameter @xmath7 , see eq.(2 ) .",
    "fig.4 demonstrates the application of the rescaled range analysis to the sample paths of @xmath64 .",
    "the index @xmath35 is 0.4 , thus the value of the hurst exponent , which we expect to get according our way of simulating fbm is 0.9 . in fig.4a",
    "the fluctuations of the range @xmath65 ( thin curve ) and those of the standard deviation @xmath66 of the increments ( thick curve ) are shown for the case when the total length of the sample is divided into 64 segments , each of = 16 lengthwise .",
    "below the variations of the ratio @xmath67 are depicted .",
    "it is shown that fluctuations of the ratio are smaller than those of the range .",
    "this circumstance justifies the use of the ratio in the empirical analysis . in fig.4b the rescaled range versus time interval @xmath22",
    "is depicted by black points in log - log scale .",
    "the slope of the fitted line gives the hurst exponent 0.83 .    in fig.5 the values of the hurst exponent @xmath68 obtained by applying the rescaled range analysis to the sample paths of @xmath42",
    "are shown by black points for the persistent processes and by crosses for the anti - persistent ones .",
    "the dots indicate the line @xmath69 , that is , the relation , which we expect to get according our way of simulating fbm . it is shown that ( i ) fairly good agreement is for intermediate @xmath35 , ( ii ) deviations between the results for @xmath42 and the theory for fbm grow to the ends of the interval of @xmath35 , and ( iii ) these deviations are larger for the anti - persistent case than for the persistent one .",
    "figures 3 and 5 allow one to conclude that in the persistent case there is a better agreement with the expected lines than in the anti - persistent case ( with the length of the sample and discretization step being equal for both cases ) . in other words , in our model the low frequency errors are less important than the high - frequency ones .",
    "this conclusion is analogous to that concerning  type 2 approximation",
    " constructed by mandelbrot and wallis @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since the way of its constructing in real space is similar to our way of constructing approximation in fourier space .",
    "moreover , we compare the results of our numerical simulations with those performed with the  type 2 approximation  and the voss algorithm @xcite and found unessential differences between the results for the exponent of the structure function , see fig.3 , and for the hurst index , see fig.5 , for the three methods",
    ". we may conclude that our method is suited for performing simulation of fbm as well as the  type 2 approximation  and the voss algorithm are . in all three models",
    "the persistent case is simulated with higher accuracy than the anti - persistent one .",
    "fortunately , the persistent case is prevalent in nature @xcite , therefore , the method proposed in our paper can be used in various applications . at last",
    ", we believe that our method will be useful for direct constructing approximations to non - gaussian fractional noises , in particular , fractional levy noises",
    ". this topic will be the subject of forthcoming paper .",
