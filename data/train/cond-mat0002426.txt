    "the steady planar fourier flow is one of the basic nonequilibrium states .",
    "it corresponds to a macroscopic system enclosed between two parallel infinite plates located at @xmath3 and @xmath4 and kept at different temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 . after a certain transient period ,",
    "the system reaches a steady state characterized by a temperature gradient @xmath7 along the direction @xmath8 normal to the plates and a constant heat flux @xmath9 . in the case of a fluid described by the navier - stokes equations ,",
    "the heat flux is just proportional to the temperature gradient ( fourier law ) : [ 1.1 ] q_z^=-(t(z ) ) , where @xmath10 is the thermal conductivity coefficient , which , in general , depends on the local temperature @xmath11 . in principle , the validity of the linear relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is restricted to small gradients , i.e. to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the characteristic _ hydrodynamic _ length defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a _",
    "microscopic _ characteristic length ( such as the mean free path in the case of a dilute gas ) .",
    "however , computer simulations of both dense fluids @xcite and dilute gases @xcite , as well as kinetic theory treatments @xcite show that equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is an excellent approximation even if @xmath16 . in the special case of dilute gases ,",
    "asmolov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found an exact solution of the boltzmann equation for maxwell molecules @xcite in which equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is verified for _ arbitrary _ values of the thermal gradient .",
    "the same result is obtained from an exact solution @xcite of the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) kinetic model @xcite for any interaction potential .",
    "the effect of gravity on the heat conduction of _ dilute _ gases is usually neglected .",
    "this is because the characteristic distance associated with gravity ( i.e. the scale height @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the thermal velocity and @xmath0 is the gravity acceleration ) is much larger than @xmath13 and @xmath15 under usual laboratory conditions .",
    "thus , the fourier law ( [ 1.1 ] ) still holds if @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "an interesting question from a physical point of view is whether or not the heat conduction is influenced by a gravity field @xmath20 along the @xmath8-direction when the conditions of rarefaction and/or the strength of the field are such that the ratio @xmath21 is not negligibly small . in the case of earth",
    "s atmosphere , for instance , @xmath22 varies only within the range of 510  km up to an altitude of 100  km @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath15 increases from @xmath23  cm at the surface to tens of km at an altitude of 500  km .",
    "consequently , @xmath24 at the surface but rapidly increases with the altitude , being @xmath25 at the base of the exosphere @xcite .    in the study of the gravity effect on the heat conduction",
    "the main quantity of interest is the _ reduced thermal conductivity _",
    "coefficient @xmath26 , where [ 1.2 ] ^ * , [ 1.3 ] = || , [ 1.4 ] g^ * = .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is a dimensionless measure of the thermal gradient over the scale of the mean free path , while @xmath28 is a measure of the strength of the gravity field over the same scale . in equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) we have identified the thermal velocity as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath31 is the mass of a particle . as a convenient definition of the mean free path we take [ 1.5 ] = , where @xmath32 is the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath33 being the number density .",
    "the above definition of @xmath15 is based on the result for the thermal conductivity coefficient @xmath34 in the bgk model @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed out that all the quantities in ( [ 1.2][1.4 ] ) are _ local _ , i.e. they depend on @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , @xmath35 is the ratio between the actual value of the heat flux ( which is in fact uniform in the steady state ) and the local value obtained from ( [ 1.1 ] ) with the actual local values of the temperature and its gradient . if the system is large enough ( @xmath36 ) and we restrict ourselves to the _ bulk domain _ ( i.e. far from the boundaries ) , it is expected that all the space dependence of @xmath35 occurs through @xmath27 and @xmath28 only .",
    "the problem of elucidating the effect of @xmath37 on the effective thermal conductivity @xmath35 has been recently addressed by us from a theoretical point of view @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the boltzmann equation for maxwell molecules was solved by a perturbation expansion through order @xmath38 .",
    "the result is [ 1.6 ] ^*(,g^*)= ^*(,0)+g^*+ ( + 503.7 ^ 2)g^*^2+o(g^*^3 ) , where @xmath39 .",
    "henceforth we take the convention that @xmath1 when the field @xmath20 is parallel to the heat flux vector @xmath40 and @xmath2 when @xmath20 is antiparallel to @xmath40 . in the first case , according to equation ( [ 1.6 ] ) , the heat transport is enhanced with respect to the navier - stokes prediction ( @xmath41 ) , while it is inhibited if @xmath2 .",
    "of course , in the limit of a negligible field ( @xmath42 ) , the validity of the fourier law for arbitrary @xmath27 @xcite is recovered ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out in the context of the bgk model of the boltzmann equation , also for maxwell molecules @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to perform the expansion through sixth order in the field , the behaviour of the numerical coefficients indicating that the series expansion is only _",
    "asymptotic_. the result to second order is [ 1.7 ] ^*(,g^*)= ^*(,0)+g^*+ ( + ^2)g^*^2 + o(g^*^3 ) .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite agrees well with a finite - difference numerical solution of the bgk equation @xcite .",
    "comparison between equations ( [ 1.6 ] ) and ( [ 1.7 ] ) shows that the bgk model tends to overestimate the influence of the gravity field .",
    "a much more complex gravity effect appears in the planar couette flow @xcite , where normal and shear stresses are present in addition to heat transport .",
    "thus far , all the previous studies about the influence of gravity on the heat conduction have been restricted to _",
    "maxwell molecules_. in addition , most of them have been based on theoretical asymptotic analyses of the boltzmann or bgk equations , the investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite being the only exception .",
    "the main merit of the maxwell interaction is that it usually makes the analytic treatment of the boltzmann equation more manageable , but otherwise it is a rather unrealistic potential .",
    "structural , thermodynamic and transport properties of real fluids are much better captured by the hard - sphere model @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the gravity effect on the planar fourier flow in the case of a dilute gas of _ hard spheres _ by solving numerically the boltzmann equation by means of the dsmc method @xcite .",
    "as will be seen , the simulation results agree qualitatively with the theoretical analyses .",
    "the physical problem is stated in section [ sec:2 ] , where a special attention is paid to the choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "the simulation method is described in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] presents the results .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "let us consider a dilute gas of hard spheres enclosed between two parallel plates located at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "both plates are maintained at temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "without loss of generality , we will assume that @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , a constant gravity field @xmath45 is applied .",
    "figure [ fig0 ] presents a schematic illustration of the system geometry . under these conditions ,",
    "the boltzmann equation reads @xcite [ 2.1 ] ( + v_z",
    "-g ) f(z,*v*,t)&=&^2d*v*_1 d ( * g * ) ( * g * ) + & & . here , @xmath46 is the one - particle velocity distribution function , @xmath47 is the diameter of a sphere , @xmath48 is the heaviside step function , @xmath49 is the relative velocity , @xmath50 is a unit vector in the direction of the line joining the centers of the two colliding particles , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are post - collisional velocities . in equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) we have already assumed that , due to the geometry of the problem , the only relevant space coordinate is @xmath8 .",
    "the hydrodynamic fields and the associated fluxes can be expressed as moments of the distribution function : [ 2.2 ] n(z , t)=d*v * f(z,*v*,t ) , [ 2.3 ] p(z , t)=md*v * * v**v*f(z,*v*,t ) , p = nk_bt = p , [ 2.4 ] * q*(z , t)=d*v * v^2*v * f(z,*v*,t ) . in the expressions of the pressure tensor , equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) , and of the heat flux , equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) , we have assumed the absence of a flow velocity field . multiplying equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) by @xmath53 and integrating over velocity space , one gets the following _ steady state _ balance equations [ 2.6 ] p_zz+mng=0 , [ 2.7 ] q_z=0 .    in order to solve the boltzmann equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) one needs to complement it with initial and boundary conditions . since we will focus on the steady state , the particular choice of initial condition is not relevant here .",
    "as for the boundary conditions , they can be expressed in terms of the kernels @xmath54 defined as follows .",
    "when a particle with velocity @xmath55 hits the wall at @xmath4 , the probability of being reemitted with a velocity @xmath56 within the range @xmath57 is @xmath58 ; the kernel @xmath59 represents the same but at @xmath3 .",
    "the boundary conditions are then @xcite [ 2.8 ] ( v_z)|v_z| f(z=\\{0,l},*v*,t)&=&(v_z)d*v* |v_z|k_(*v * , * v* ) + & & ( v_z)f(z=\\{0,l},*v*,t ) . in this paper",
    "we consider boundary conditions of complete accommodation with the walls , so that @xmath60 does not depend on the incoming velocity @xmath55 and can be written as [ 2.9 ] k_(*v*)=a_^-1(v_z)|v_z| _ ( * v*),a_=d*v*(v_z)|v_z| _ ( * v * ) , where @xmath61 represents the probability distribution of a fictitious gas in contact with the system at @xmath62 . equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) can then be interpreted as meaning that when a particle hits a wall , it is absorbed and then replaced by a particle leaving the fictitious bath .",
    "of course , any choice of @xmath63 must be consistent with the imposed wall temperatures , i.e. [ 2.10 ] k_bt_=md*v * v^2 _ ( * v * ) .",
    "the simplest and most common choice is that of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution : [ 2.11 ] _ ( * v*)=()^3/2 ( - ) .",
    "these boundary conditions have been frequently used in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite as well as in kinetic theory analyses @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the system is understood to be enclosed between two independent baths _ at equilibrium _ at temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively . while the conditions ( [ 2.11 ] ) are adequate for analysing boundary effects @xcite , they are not very efficient when the interest lies on the transport properties in the bulk . in order to inhibit the influence of boundary effects , it is more convenient to imagine that the two fictitious baths are in _ nonequilibrium _ states resembling the state of the actual gas near the walls .",
    "more specifically , we can assume that the fictitious gases are described by the bgk equation , whose exact solution for the steady planar fourier flow ( in the absence of gravity ) is known @xcite .",
    "in that case , [ 2.12 ] _ ( * v*)&=&()^3/2 ( - ) + & & _ 0^d ( ( 1-)v_z)^-3/2 + & & , where we have additionally assumed statistical independence among the three velocity components . in equation (",
    "[ 2.12 ] ) @xmath64 is the local reduced thermal gradient at @xmath62 .",
    "if we formally take the limit @xmath65 , equation ( [ 2.12 ] ) reduces to equation ( [ 2.11 ] ) @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .",
    "the exact solution of the bgk model @xcite has the properties @xmath68 ( for hard spheres ) and @xmath69 ; from them , it is easy to obtain [ 2.13 ] _ = t_^-1/2 , where [ 2.14 ] = _ 0^l dz n(z ) is the average density .",
    "this second class of boundary conditions were first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they proved to be much more efficient than the conditions ( [ 2.11 ] ) for the heat conduction problem .",
    "following the same terminology as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will refer to the `` equilibrium '' conditions ( [ 2.11 ] ) as conditions of type i and to the `` nonequilibrium '' conditions ( [ 2.12 ] ) as conditions of type ii .",
    "in order to solve numerically the boltzmann equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) with both types of boundary conditions , we have used the so - called direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method @xcite .",
    "comparison with known exact solutions of the boltzmann equation under strong nonequilibrium conditions @xcite proves the reliability and efficiency of the dsmc method to solve the boltzmann equation . in this method ,",
    "the velocity distribution function is represented by the velocities @xmath70 and positions @xmath71 of a sufficiently large number of particles @xmath72 . given the geometry of our problem , the physical system is split into layers of width @xmath73 , sufficiently smaller than the mean free path .",
    "the velocities and coordinates are updated from time @xmath74 to time @xmath75 , where the timestep @xmath76 is much smaller than the mean free time , by applying a convection step followed by a collision step . in the _ convection step _ , the particles are moved ballistically , i.e. @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in addition , those particles crossing the boundaries are reentered with velocities sampled from the corresponding probability distribution @xmath79 .",
    "the _ collision step _ proceeds as follows @xcite . for each layer @xmath80 ,",
    "a pair of potential collision partners , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and a unit vector @xmath83 are chosen at random with equiprobability .",
    "the collision between particles @xmath81 and @xmath82 is then accepted with a probability equal to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the relative velocity , @xmath86 is the collision rate of the pair @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the number density in layer @xmath80 , and @xmath89 is an upper bound estimate of the collision rate in the layer .",
    "if the collision is accepted , post - collisional velocities @xmath90 are assigned to both particles .",
    "after the collision is processed or if the pair is rejected , the routine moves again to the choice of a new pair until the required number of candidate pairs @xmath91 in the layer , where @xmath92 is the total number of particles in layer @xmath80 , has been processed .    in the course of the simulations , the following `` coarse - grained '' local quantities are computed . the number density in layer",
    "@xmath80 is [ 2.15 ] n_==_i=1^n _ ( z_i ) , where @xmath93 is the characteristic function of layer @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath94 if @xmath8 belongs to layer @xmath80 and is zero otherwise .",
    "similarly , the temperature , the pressure tensor and the heat flux of layer @xmath80 are [ 2.16 ] k_bt_==_i=1^n _ ( z_i ) v_i^2 , [ 2.17 ] p_=m_i=1^n _ ( z_i ) * v*_i*v*_i , [ 2.18 ] * q*_=_i=1^n _ ( z_i ) v_i^2*v*_i .",
    "according to equation ( [ 2.7 ] ) , @xmath40 is a constant in the steady state .",
    "thus , we have also evaluated the _ average _ heat flux as [ 2.19 ] = _ _ = _ i=1^n v_i^2*v*_i .",
    "the standard definition of mean free path in the case of hard spheres is @xcite [ 2.20 ] =. this quantity is not exactly the same as the mean free path defined by equation ( [ 1.5 ] ) , which is based on the bgk model .",
    "the thermal conductivity of a dilute system of hard spheres is ( in the first approximation ) @xcite [ 2.21 ] = , so that @xmath95 . in the following , we take units such that @xmath96 ( length unit ) , @xmath97 ( mass unit ) , @xmath98 ( speed unit ) , @xmath99 ( temperature unit ) and @xmath100 ( density level ) .",
    "the units of these and other related quantities are given in table [ table0 ] .",
    "the table also gives the values of those units taking as a reference example a gas with @xmath101   , @xmath102  kg , @xmath103  k and @xmath104  m@xmath105 , which are typical of the atmospheric conditions at an altitude of 220  km @xcite .    .",
    "units used in this paper for the relevant quantities .",
    "the third column gives the `` real '' values of those units taking @xmath101   , @xmath102  kg , @xmath103  k and @xmath106  m@xmath105 as a reference example .",
    "[ table0 ] [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the absence of gravity ( @xmath107 ) , we observe that @xmath35 is smaller than 1 .",
    "this is in part due to a residual influence of boundary effects @xcite , as indicated by the fact that @xmath35 is closer to 1 with boundary conditions of type ii than with those of type i. from the exact solution of the boltzmann equation for an _ unbounded _ system of maxwell molecules @xcite , it follows that @xmath108 for @xmath109 and arbitrary @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is possible that @xmath110 is slightly smaller than 1 in the case of hard spheres , even if any boundary effect is removed .",
    "thus , in order to characterize the _ pure _ gravity - dependence of the effective thermal conductivity @xmath35 at a given value of @xmath27 , we define [ 2.27 ] ^*(,g^*)^*(,g^*)-^*(,0 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath111 for the corresponding fixed values of @xmath112 are also included in tables [ table1][table4 ] and are plotted in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is observed in figure [ fig5 ] that , although somewhat scattered , the points tend to lie on smooth curves .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath113 is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for maxwell molecules , equations ( [ 1.6 ] ) and ( [ 1.7 ] ) .",
    "more specifically , the departure from the fourier law , as measured by @xmath113 , is positive when the gravity field is parallel to the heat flux ( @xmath114 ) , while it is negative when both vectors are mutually antiparallel ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the deviation is larger in the former case than in the latter , i.e. @xmath116 . from figure [ fig5 ] we can also conclude that the gravity influence is less dramatic when the boundary effects are more important , since @xmath117 tends to be smaller in the case of boundary conditions of type i. from the data corresponding to the boundary conditions of type ii we can estimate that @xmath118 , where the coefficient @xmath119 has a value between 2 and 2.5 .",
    "this is about 4 times smaller than the exact coefficient @xmath120 obtained in the case of maxwell molecules .",
    "we are not able at present to elucidate which part of this discrepancy in the numerical value of @xmath119 is attributable to boundary effects still present in our simulation results and which part is due to the role played by the interaction . besides ,",
    "when comparing results obtained with different interactions , one must have in mind that the choice of appropriate dimensionless parameters is not unique . in our case",
    ", we have defined @xmath27 , equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) , and @xmath28 , equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) , by using the mean free path given by equation ( [ 1.5 ] ) , which is based on the bgk model .",
    "if , on the other hand , we had used the standard mean free path of hard spheres , equation ( [ 2.20 ] ) , then we would have @xmath121 , where @xmath122 .",
    "in this paper we have numerically solved the boltzmann equation ( by means of the dsmc method ) for a steady heat conduction problem of hard spheres in the presence of a gravity field .",
    "the gas is enclosed between two parallel plates separated a distance equal to @xmath123 ( average ) mean free paths .",
    "two different temperature ratios ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) and two alternative types of boundary conditions ( boundary effects being more important in the case of type i than in the case of type ii ) have been considered .",
    "for each one of these four possibilities we have applied 12 or 13 different values of a constant gravity field @xmath126 normal to the plates .",
    "the sign criterion is such that @xmath1 means a field antiparallel to the thermal gradient ( and hence parallel to the heat flux vector ) , while @xmath2 means the opposite .",
    "the first conclusion we draw from the results is that the hydrodynamic profiles are rather sensitive to the value of @xmath0 . while the pressure @xmath127 is roughly uniform if @xmath107 , it decreases ( increases ) with @xmath8 if @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , this effect being more important as the magnitude of @xmath0 grows",
    "this is not surprising since it is an extension to nonequilibrium states of the equilibrium barometric law @xmath128 .",
    "a less obvious effect appears in the case of the temperature profile .",
    "if there were no temperature jumps at the walls , the temperature of the gas would change from @xmath5 at @xmath3 to @xmath6 at @xmath4 , irrespective of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , due to unavoidable boundary effects , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "our simulation results show that the temperature jump at the cold ( hot ) wall decreases as the value of @xmath0 increases ( decreases ) . for instance , in the case @xmath131 with boundary conditions of type ii , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 , while @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 . in other words , the temperature jump at a wall decreases as the relative density near that wall increases",
    "the more positive ( negative ) @xmath0 is , the larger the density is near the cold ( hot ) wall and the smaller the temperature jump is . since the temperature jump is more important near the hot wall , a side effect of",
    "the above discussion is that the ( average ) thermal gradient across the system increases when @xmath0 decreases , so that it is larger for @xmath1 than for @xmath2 .",
    "a larger thermal gradient implies a larger magnitude of the heat flux and this expectation is confirmed by our simulation results , which show that @xmath138 clearly increases as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "our interest has not focused , however , on the _ absolute _ change of the heat flux due to the gravity field , but on its change _ relative _ to the navier - stokes prediction when the _ actual _ temperature gradient is considered . to that end",
    "we have introduced the ratio @xmath35 defined by equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) , which is a local quantity that in the _ bulk _ region is expected to depend on space only through a functional dependence on the reduced thermal gradient @xmath27 , equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) , and gravity strength @xmath28 , equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) .",
    "for each one of the four different combinations of @xmath139 and boundary conditions we have fixed a value @xmath140 ( @xmath141@xmath142 ) and have analysed the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath143 .",
    "the simulation results for hard spheres presented in this paper are in qualitative agreement with those obtained for maxwell molecules by a perturbation analysis of the boltzmann @xcite and the bgk @xcite equations .",
    "more specifically , when the field and the heat flux are parallel ( @xmath114 ) the gravity induces an enhancement of the ( relative ) heat conduction ( @xmath144 ) , while the opposite happens when both vectors are mutually antiparallel .",
    "in addition , the influence of gravity is more pronounced in the former case than in the latter . at a quantitative level , on the other hand ,",
    "the values of @xmath145 reported here are typically smaller than those theoretically estimated for comparable values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "a certain part of this difference is possibly due to boundary effects still present in our simulations and absent in the theoretical analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this expectation is supported by the fact that @xmath145 is generally smaller in the case of conditions of type i than in that of type ii , thus indicating that boundary effects tend to mitigate the influence of gravity . notwithstanding this",
    ", the remaining difference leads us to conclude that the response of the system to the application of the field , as measured by @xmath146 , is less important in the case of hard spheres than in the case of maxwell molecules .",
