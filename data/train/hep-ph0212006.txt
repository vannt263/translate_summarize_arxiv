    "one of the natural explanations for the existence of the fermionic generations is the compositeness@xcite of the known leptons and quarks , sharing common constituents ( preons ) . according to this approach",
    ", a quark or lepton might be a bound state of three fermions @xcite or a fermion and a boson @xcite . in many models along this line ,",
    "quarks and leptons are composed of a scalar and a spin-1/2 preon .",
    "composite models @xcite predict a rich spectrum of excited states@xcite of known particles .",
    "naturally , in these models spin-1/2 is assigned to the lowest lying radial and orbital excitations .",
    "searching for the spin of the lowest lying fermionic excitations could thus give a rather direct clue to the underlying preon structure .",
    "therefore , it is important to conduct experiments which will probe possible substructure of leptons and quarks and test the variety of preonic models .",
    "exchange of preons may lead to contact interactions between quarks and leptons . in this sense , it is conceivable that the standard model ( sm ) is just the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory which is characterized by a large mass scale @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of four - fermion contact interactions would be a signal of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "if the experimental energy scale is high enough , the nature of this new physics can be probed .",
    "it is expected that the next generation of hadron colliders like the lhc which will achieve very high centre of mass energies will extend the search for composite states . in particular",
    ", contact interactions may be an important source for excited lepton production at the cern lhc .",
    "updated lower limits on the scale of compositeness @xmath0 are given by the aleph collaboration , @xmath1 tev @xcite and d0 collaboration @xmath2 tev @xcite .",
    "lower mass limits for excited lepton mass are given by the zeus collaboration , @xmath3 gev@xcite and the opal collaboration , @xmath4 gev@xcite .    in the present study , single production of excited electrons is simulated through contact interactions at lhc energies .",
    "the excited muon production is similar to @xmath5 production at hadron colliders .",
    "however , with a good @xmath6 separation , @xmath7 can be easily detected .",
    "but overall statistical significances for @xmath7 should be very similar to an excited electron production case .",
    "this work is a continuation of previous work devoted to the study of the excited quark production with subsequent decay to a quark and photon @xcite , a quark and gluon@xcite and a quark and @xmath8@xcite .",
    "in phenomenological models , it is assumed that any theory of compositeness at large mass scale must have a low energy limit that preserves the symmetries of the sm .",
    "if quarks and leptons are composite at the energy scale @xmath9 , the strong forces binding their constituents induce flavor - diagonal contact interactions , which have significant effects at subprocess energies well below @xmath9@xcite .",
    "contact interactions between quarks and leptons may appear as the low energy limit of the exchange of heavy particles . at sufficiently high energies",
    "excited fermions could be produced directly .",
    "they should form weak iso - doublets and carry electromagnetic charges similar to those of the ordinary fermions .",
    "we will assume that the excited leptons have spin and isospin 1/2 to limit the number of parameters .",
    "excited electrons may couple to ordinary quarks via contact interactions resulting from preon interactions . for energies below the compositeness scale @xmath9",
    ", these interactions can be described by an effective four - fermion lagrangian@xcite    @xmath10    with    @xmath11    where the coupling @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are coefficients for left - handed and right - handed currents , respectively . here",
    "we assume @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for simplicity .    at the cern lhc",
    "pp collider , excited electrons can be produced either singly @xmath17 or in pairs @xmath18 through contact interactions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the partonic cross sections for excited electron production through contact interactions are given by @xcite    @xmath19    @xmath20    where    @xmath21    where @xmath22 denotes the mandelstam variable for the subprocess , the centre of mass energy .",
    "cross sections for single and pair production of excited electrons through contact interactions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . since @xmath23 pair production requires larger centre of mass energy than single @xmath24 production , it is less favored .",
    "cross section values presented in this paper were calculated using cteq5l parton distribution function ( pdf)@xcite . other pdf s were tried : grv94 lo@xcite and cteq3l@xcite differ in their cross - section prediction by about 20% and 30% , respectively .",
    "these pdf s extend slightly the mass reach for excited electrons at the lhc .",
    "one should notice that excited leptons can also be produced via gauge interactions ( see the effective lagrangian in the next subsection ) .",
    "gauge interactions can give rise to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 signatures .",
    "the study of such scenario has been done in  @xcite . however , since those processes involve electromagnetic or electroweak couplings they contribute to less than 1% compared to the excited lepton production rate via contact interactions .    in the same time",
    "contact interactions will modify the drell - yan(dy ) dilepton production process and one should definitively check how big are deviations from the sm  @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the sensitivity of the lhc to the compositeness scale in the drell - yan channel is very high  for an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath28 , one has @xmath29  tev at 5 sigma level limit !  @xcite    this means that , for the range of @xmath30  tev we consider here , the signal in the dy channel from contact interactions will be unavoidably large !",
    "therefore our study should be considered as the study not for the determination of the limits on @xmath9 ( which can be done _",
    "much _ better using dy channel ) but as the study of the excited electron production at the lhc",
    ". one should stress the big complementary role of the dy channel , however , if one would observe signal from the excited electron production , the signal from contact interactions should also be present in dy channel too .",
    "one should notice also that the `` charged current '' contact term like @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 is not forbidden by @xmath34 symmetry and can give rise to @xmath35 production in contact interactions at the lhc .",
    "we do not consider this effective interaction in our study .",
    "the effective lagrangian which describes the transition between excited and ground states via gauge interactions is given by @xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the field strength tensors of the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge fields with the gauge structure constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ; the factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe the effective deviations from the sm coupling constants ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the corresponding gauge coupling constants .",
    "an excited electron can then decay via gauge interactions to a gauge boson and an ordinary lepton .",
    "here we assume that excited electrons have a mass larger than the @xmath45 and @xmath46 boson masses and the main decay mode via gauge interaction will be two - body decays ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the decay widths :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath40 denotes the third component of the weak isospin and hypercharge of @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the structure constants are defined as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the weinberg angle .",
    "for @xmath56 we neglect @xmath57 and @xmath58 terms , and the total width for gauge interaction decay can be obtained as follows    @xmath59    where the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 simply reduce to the approximate values -1(0 ) , 0.707(0.707 ) and -0.269(-0.5 ) for @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , respectively .",
    "the present analysis will assume @xmath62 , but the results can easily be reinterpreted for different values of these parameters , accounting for the change in branching ratio and intrinsic width .",
    "the decay width of a fermion via contact interactions ( three - body decay ) is given by    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the number of colours of the fermions ( @xmath66 for quarks(leptons ) ) and @xmath67 is a factor given by    @xmath68    we present decay widths and branching ratios for gauge and contact interactions in table  [ table1 ] , for @xmath69 and for the case when we fix @xmath9 at 6  tev scale .",
    "the choice of @xmath70  tev is motivated by the fact that the case of @xmath69 looks unnatural from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the effective energy of the parton - level collision ( @xmath71 ) at the lhc is of the order of several tev . in case @xmath72",
    "the validity of series expansion of the effective lagrangian in terms of @xmath73 is arguable , at least for @xmath74 values below 1  tev . with respect to this fact ,",
    "the choice of @xmath75  tev ) is safer and theoretically motivated . here",
    "we will take @xmath76 tev , corresponding to the aleph limit @xcite , as a reference .",
    "although decay by contact interaction dominates for @xmath69 , the decay via gauge interactions is proportional to @xmath77 , while decay via contact interactions varies as @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the relative importance of the decay mediated by contact interactions on the total decay width will be suppressed by the factor @xmath79 .",
    "this fact is clearly illustrated in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "one can see that ( contrary to @xmath69 ) in the case @xmath70  tev the excited electron decay is dominated by gauge interactions up to @xmath80 tev .",
    "however , for @xmath81 tev the contribution from contact interactions to the total decay width is dominant and can not be neglected .",
    "decays by contact interactions yield @xmath82 and @xmath83 final states , but the two jets or the two leptons accompanying the electron do not have the mass of the @xmath46 .    * *    .decay widths ( @xmath84 ) and branching ratios via gauge and contact interactions , for @xmath69 and @xmath76  tev ( in parenthesis ) [ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , signal signatures can be observed for excited electron masses from 500 gev up to 1000 gev over the total background .",
    "the second subprocess , when @xmath45 decays to a lepton and a neutrino , gives pairs of leptons and neutrinos .",
    "the effective mass reconstruction is very difficult in this case .",
    "it requires the evaluation of the neutrino longitudinal momenta , which is impossible without certain kinematical constraints .",
    "however , estimating the acceptance and efficiencies at 65% and 20% , respectively , the transverse mass distribution @xmath85 ( @xmath86 is the electron recoiling against @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the lepton from @xmath45 decay ) should yield an observable excess of events over backgrounds for excited electron masses up to 4.5 tev .",
    "this process could therefore confirm excited electron observation , obtained from others channels .",
    "in the framework of a composite model of quarks and leptons , sharing common constituents , excited electrons could be produced copiously at cern lhc . the first indication for the excited electrons could be the production of ordinary leptons at rates much larger than expected in the framework of the sm .",
    "large lepton yields are expected if quarks and leptons share common sub - constituents .",
    "clean signatures are predicted by the large fraction of decays with leptons in the final state , that are a consequence of the uniform coupling among quarks and leptons through contact interactions .",
    "we have presented the results of excited single electron production with subsequent decay mediated by gauge and contact interactions . singly produced",
    "excited electrons could be accessible up to a mass of 5 tev at lhc for @xmath89 tev .",
    "for the excited electrons masses decay both contact and gauge interactions plays important role and should be considered together . for comparatively light excited leptons ( @xmath90  tev ) the decays mediated by contact interactions may be considerably suppressed , while for higher masses of excited states the contribution from contact interactions to the total decay width is dominant .",
    "the decay channel @xmath46 @xmath32 @xmath91 is expected to give results comparable to @xmath46 @xmath32 @xmath92 , but with somewhat lower energy resolution .",
    "this work has been performed within the atlas collaboration with the help of the simulation framework and tools which are the result of the collaboration - wide efforts .",
