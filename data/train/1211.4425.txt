    "the conformational properties of polymers exposed to disordered media are strongly affected by the surrounding disorder potential . for the case of flexible polymers ,",
    "the impact of disorder on polymers has already been widely discussed [ 19 ] .",
    "the special case of geometrical constraining environments has been investigated in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that geometrical restrictions to chain conformations also play a crucial role for biological systems . in these systems",
    ", polymers may no longer be assumed flexible and models of moderately stiff polymers , called _ semiflexible _",
    "polymers , are introduced .",
    "the stiffness is characterized by the persistence length @xmath0 . on length scales shorter than the persistence length ,",
    "the polymers behave like stiff rods , on longer scales they exhibit entropic flexibility and random coiling occurs",
    ". the geometrical restrictions of the environment along with the intrinsic stiffness of the polymers lead to an interesting phenomenology , which , in contrast to the case of flexible polymers , is much less understood for semiflexible polymers [ 1014 ] . in this work",
    "we examine the equilibrium properties of a pinned _ semiflexible _ polymer exposed to a quenched random potential consisting of hard disks .",
    "the disks are arranged on the sites of a square lattice .",
    "we build up on @xcite , where _ flexible _ polymers exposed to hard - disk disorder assembled on the sites of a square lattice were investigated .",
    "we extend the polymer model to comprise bending stiffness .",
    "the appropriate polymer model is the heisenberg chain model .",
    "additionally , we consider the effect of leaving the constraint of a fixed starting point .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we describe the polymer model and the assumed disorder configurations .",
    "is devoted to the employed simulation algorithms and in we define the measured observables , discuss the simulation parameters , and present a few test cases . our main results are contained in , where we first discuss the low disorder - density case and then the more intricate high - density regime .",
    "we conclude this section with a few remarks on the impact of the hard - disk diameter and the initial pinpoint .",
    "finally , in we summarize our main findings .",
    "effectively , the heisenberg chain is a bead - stick model consisting of @xmath1 beads at positions @xmath2 connected by bonds of fixed length @xmath3 . therefore , the contour has a length of @xmath4 .",
    "our considerations are made for the case of two dimensions and a phantom chain where self - avoiding constraints are neglected .",
    "the connecting line between two monomers defines a unit tangent vector @xmath5 .",
    "the elastic properties are governed by the bending energy @xmath6 where @xmath7 determines the angle between neighboring bonds and @xmath8 is a coupling constant . the correlations between the two - dimensional tangent vectors of the free heisenberg chain decay at inverse temperature @xmath9 as @xcite @xmath10^k ,    \\label{eq : ratioofbesselfunctions}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath12 .",

    "is the hamiltonian of the worm - like chain , also called kratky - porod model @xcite , one of the most famous and widely spread models for treating semiflexible polymers analytically .",
    "a central property of the worm - like chain is its _ persistence length _ @xmath0 , which is the tangent vector correlation length @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 . in the continuum limit of the heisenberg chain hamiltonian",
    ", we consider the following approximation . for large @xmath23 or small @xmath3 , and therefore large @xmath24",
    ", the modified bessel function in yields @xcite : @xmath25 thus , for large @xmath26 and @xmath27 one finds for the tangent correlations by inserting into to leading order : @xmath28 a comparison of with and identifying @xmath29 with @xmath20 results in @xmath30 the persistence length is thus the ratio between bending stiffness @xmath31 and thermal energy @xmath32 and is therefore a measure of the stiffness of a polymer . in general dimension",
    "@xmath33 it holds @xcite : @xmath34 there are three regimes defining three classes of polymers : @xmath35 at last we want to remark on the mean square end - to - end distance @xmath36 . using the definition @xmath37 together with , its calculation is straightforward and amounts in the continuum limit to ( cp .",

    "\\label{eq : meansquareendtoendanalytical}\\ ] ]      the background potential consists of hard disks with diameter @xmath39 that interact with the monomers of the polymer via hard - core repulsion described by the potential @xmath40 where @xmath33 is the distance between a monomer and a hard - disk center .",
    "thus , the monomers  here described by points  may not be placed onto the area of a disk .",
    "the assembly of the disks is the same as in @xcite .",
    "the disks are put onto the sites of a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath41 .",
    "each site is occupied with a certain occupation probability @xmath42 independent of the other sites .",
    "consequently , there is no interaction between neighboring disks besides the constraint that the minimum distance between two disk centers is @xmath41 , the lattice constant .",
    "this leads to clustering and hence a spatially inhomogeneous structure of obstacles @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we apply two algorithms for double - checking our results .",
    "one is an off - lattice growth algorithm proposed by garel and orland @xcite and one is the multicanonical monte carlo method [ 2224 ] . here",
    ", we only concentrate on those aspects which are relevant for the semiflexible case .",
    "otherwise we refer to @xcite .    for the multicanonical approach we have developed in @xcite a special modification , allowing us to reweight to different background potential amplitudes . to this end",
    ", we replace the infinite hard - disk potential with finite potential steps and after performing the multicanonical simulation at fixed persistence length , we are able to reweight to any potential amplitude ranging from the free polymer ( zero amplitude ) to the polymer in a hard - disk background ( very large amplitude ) .",
    "the basic routine of the growth method  also called replication - deletion procedure ( rdp)is comprised in .",
    "polymers are grown in parallel from an initial starting point . in each step , a polymer configuration is cloned according to the boltzmann weight @xmath43 for adding a new monomer .",
    "@xmath44 is defined as the integer part of @xmath43 and @xmath45 as the rest . replicating the new chain @xmath43 times",
    "statistically means replicating it @xmath46 times plus one additional time with probability @xmath47 .",
    "therefore a random number @xmath48 with @xmath49 is drawn .",
    "if @xmath50 , the chain is replicated @xmath46 times . otherwise it is replicated @xmath51 times .",
    "since @xmath43 can be smaller than 1 , the replication can in fact amount to a deletion .",
    "this is why the method is called replication - deletion - procedure .",
    "the different clones are treated as independent polymer configurations and are grown until the desired degree of polymerization is reached . in dependence on the hamiltonian of the system ,",
    "cloning the configurations according to the boltzmann weight leads  except for very simple situations  to either exponential increase of the numbers of configurations or to dying out of almost all configurations .",
    "both cases defy the estimation of meaningful numerical averages .",
    "this problem can be overcome by introducing a population control parameter ( pcp ) , ensuring that the number of sampled configurations @xmath52 roughly coincides with the initial number of chains @xmath53 . for the principle of the pcp",
    ", we refer to the original paper by garel and orland @xcite and to @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we analyzed in detail the behavior of a polymer in a potential consisting of hard disks distributed on the sites of a square lattice .",
    "we found that the polymer , depending on the ratio of persistence length and void space extension , either crumples up ( small @xmath54 ) or straightens ( large @xmath54 ) for increasing density of the potential .",
    "this is consistent with the results that , e.g. , cifra @xcite recently found . besides",
    ", the periodic structure of the lattice is reflected in the distribution functions of the polymer .",
    "furthermore , we found that the distributions  in the case of pinning the polymer at one end  strongly reflect the local cluster structure of the disorder .",
    "leaving the constraint of pinning lets the polymer escape local cavities and gain entropy in larger void - space clusters .",
    "the corresponding distributions for pinned and non - pinned polymers differ considerably .",
    "finally , we checked the applicability of an off - lattice growth algorithm to the problem of a semiflexible polymer exposed to high - density disorder in the form of steric hindrance . by employing two conceptually completely different algorithms to the problem",
    " the off - lattice growth algorithm and the multicanonical monte carlo method  we corroborated that the tested method is well usable .",
    "for a combination of large occupation and long persistence length the growth method is even performing better .",
    "we want to emphasize the ability of the growth algorithm to provide distributions for all chain lengths up to the desired degree of polymerization within one simulation . equipped with this finding ,",
    "a challenging next step is to investigate the behavior of semiflexible polymers in hard - disk fluid disorder .",
