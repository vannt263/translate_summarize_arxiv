    "observations of radio @xcite and hard x - ray @xcite emission from several clusters of galaxies promoted these objects to the role of largest nonthermal sources in the universe . on the theoretical side , two ideas contributed to reinforce the belief that clusters of galaxies can be interesting as high energy radiation emitters : in @xcite it was first understood that cosmic rays accelerated within the cluster volume would be confined there for cosmological time scales , enhancing the possibility of inelastic proton - proton collisions and consequent gamma ray production through the decay of neutral pions . in @xcite it was recognized that large scale shocks associated with the formation of structures in the universe , may accelerate electrons to tev energies , implying that high energy emission would occur due to the upscatter of the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to gamma ray energies , through inverse compton scattering ( ics ) .",
    "the possibility that single clusters could be sources of high energy gamma rays fueled much interest also in the related possibility that clusters could in fact be also responsible for the observed isotropic diffuse gamma ray background ( dgrb ) @xcite , thought to be of extragalactic origin ( although the possibility that at least a fraction of this background might in fact be explained in terms of ics from electrons in the halo of our galaxy @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite it was found that the diffuse background due to inelastic interactions of cosmic rays trapped in the intracluster medium could not add up to more than @xmath0 of the observed flux above @xmath1 mev , confirming previous calculations illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of electrons at the shocks related to the process of structure formation was more recently considered in @xcite , where the observed dgrb was found to be saturated by the cluster contribution . a more realistic calculation",
    "@xcite showed that ics of electrons in clusters can not contribute more than @xmath2 of the observed dgrb ( of this , only @xmath3 is actually related to cluster mergers , while most of the flux comes from electrons accelerated at accretion shocks ) .",
    "this result is in closer agreement with the results obtained in recent numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "although it seems now unlikely that clusters may play an important role in explaining the bulk of the extragalactic dgrb , it seems plausible that future gamma ray telescopes , especially in space , may finally be able to detect the gamma ray glow associated with the formation of single clusters of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we analyze this possibility more quantitatively , making use of a formalism developed in @xcite that allows us to evaluate the strength of the shocks that develop during mergers of two clusters , or during accretion of new matter onto an already existing cluster potential well . the important point made in @xcite",
    "is that most merger related shocks are weak and unable to accelerate particles efficiently , a result later confirmed in @xcite and in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that a gamma ray telescope like glast should be able to detect @xmath4 clusters of galaxies at energies above @xmath1 mev .",
    "it is interesting that several clusters are expected to be detected even with agile , while we confirm the undetectability of these sources with egret .",
    "this is consistent with the recent results in @xcite where new upper limits on the gamma ray emission from abell clusters have been found , using old egret data .",
    "the situation looks much less promising for ground based cherenkov experiments , which are optimized for point sources : nearby clusters , with larger fluences , appear as relatively extended sources for these experiments , so that the corresponding potential for detection is lowered .",
    "clusters at larger distances are point sources , but their fluence is well below the detection threshold of cherenkov experiments . moreover , at energies in excess of a few hundred gev the effect of absorption in the cosmological infrared background becomes important , and contributes to further suppress the flux of gamma radiation from distant clusters .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that clusters of galaxies may be seen as shining at @xmath5 gev energies in the near future .",
    "the paper is planned as follows : in  [ sec : shock ] we describe the acceleration of particles at shocks occurring during structure formation . in  [ sec : structure ] we summarize our recipe for the calculation of the strength of the shocks associated with the process of structure formation .",
    "the consequences on the spectra of shock accelerated particles are also summarized . in  [ sec : space ] we assess the detectability of clusters of galaxies with space - borne experiments , specializing our predictions to the upcoming agile and glast satellites . in ",
    "[ sec : cherenkov ] the issue of detectability is discussed in connection with ground based cherenkov experiments .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the hot gas in the intracluster medium is the proof that structure formation proceeds through shock waves , that heat up the gas to the virial temperature whose value is determined by the depth of the dark matter potential well .",
    "the conversion of gravitational energy of the dark matter into thermal energy of the gas component occurs when the gas crosses shock waves that are created during the process of structure formation .",
    "diffusive acceleration can take place at these shocks , so that a small fraction of the particles in the accreting gas is extracted from the thermal distribution and energized to nonthermal energies .",
    "the acceleration time , necessary to energize a particle to energy @xmath6 is given by @xcite : @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are the fluid speed and diffusion coefficient of the particles upstream ( downstream ) . from the physical point of view",
    ", @xmath12 is the sum of the residence times of particles upstream ( index 1 ) and downstream ( index 2 ) .",
    "for well behaved diffusion coefficients , larger magnetic field strengths correspond to lower values of the diffusion coefficient , namely particles diffuse more slowly when the magnetic field is larger .",
    "this immediately suggests that the diffusion coefficient upstream is larger than the same quantity ( at the same particle energy ) downstream , so the residence time of the particles upstream is larger than the residence time in the downstream region .",
    "the acceleration time can therefore be approximated as follows : @xmath13 where we introduced the compression factor @xmath14 and we used the relation between @xmath15 and the mach number @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the acceleration time depends in first approximation only on quantities that refer to the upstream fluid , where the magnetic field has not been affected yet by the passage of the shock , and preserves therefore its pre - shock structure .",
    "one may argue that the diffusion coefficient in the downstream region is dominated by the scattering of particles on magnetic field fluctuation lengths comparable to the larmor radius of the particles , namely @xmath18 .",
    "it is likely that these fluctuations are in fact created by the accelerated particles themselves . in the upstream region",
    "however it is possible that the diffusion coefficient is determined by the magnetic field structure pre - existing the shock transit . in principle",
    "the momentum and magnetic field dependence of the two fields upstream and downstream may be different .    for simplicity and convenience",
    "we assume here that the diffusion coefficient on both sides is bhm - like . moreover , since the term in brackets in eq .",
    "[ eq : tauacc ] varies between @xmath19 and @xmath20 when the mach number changes between @xmath21 and infinity , we neglect this term for the purpose of estimating the acceleration time , therefore the acceleration time becomes : @xmath22 we stress again here that the magnetic field @xmath23 and velocity @xmath8 refer to the unshocked medium .",
    "here we focus our attention on electrons .",
    "their energy losses are dominated by ics , with time scale : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy density in the cmb radiation . equating the acceleration and losses time scales we obtain an estimate of the maximum energy of accelerated electrons in case of bhm diffusion : @xmath26 for electron energies up to @xmath27 tev the ics off the cmb photons",
    "occurs in the thomson regime , therefore the maximum energy of the radiated photons is simply : @xmath28 as shown in @xcite , if the diffusion coefficient in the unshocked medium is not bhm - like , then the maximum energy of the electrons may be appreciably lower than found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emax ] ) , and insufficient to upscatter the cmb photons to gamma ray energies . in the following",
    "we assume that the maximum energy is well defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : emax ] ) .",
    "the value of the magnetic field to adopt in our calculations depends crucially on whether we are describing particle acceleration at merger related shocks , or at accretion shocks .",
    "the former have relatively low mach numbers @xcite and occur in the virialized regions of clusters of galaxies , where the magnetic field is expected to be in the @xmath29 range .",
    "accretion shocks propagate in a cold unshocked medium , where the magnetic field is expected to set at the cosmological value , for which only upper limits are available . the field in the intracluster medium",
    "could be the result of magnetic pollution from sources within the cluster @xcite , being therefore unrelated to the magnetic field in the intergalactic medium outside clusters .",
    "alternatively , the intracluster magnetic field could result from the compression of the external field , if the latter is of cosmological origin .",
    "the energy of the photons radiated by the accelerated electrons through ics is above @xmath30 whenever the magnetic field @xmath23 is larger than @xmath31 gauss .",
    "this bound is certainly satisfied by the intracluster magnetic field , not necessarily by the poorly known field in the intergalactic medium outside clusters , for which upper limits of @xmath32 have been found , depending on the field structure @xcite . on the other hand",
    "this constraint has to be taken with caution for the case of accretion shocks , because in a more realistic situation , as suggested by numerical simulations , high mach number shocks are located close to filaments , where a substantial compression of cosmological fields might have occurred .",
    "we assume in the following that the electrons accelerated at both merger and accretion shocks are energetic enough to radiate gamma ray photons up to the @xmath33 region .",
    "in the next section we will show that there is a wide spread in the mach numbers from about unity to @xmath34 @xcite , with a peak around @xmath21 @xcite for the weak merger related shocks .",
    "there is a correspondingly large spread in the power law index of the accelerated particles , while very little spread exists in the maximum energy that can be achieved at these shocks .",
    "it is commonly believed that clusters of galaxies form hierarchically , with smaller dark matter halos merging together to form more massive halos . the shock surfaces that form during these mergers are responsible for the conversion of gravitational energy into thermal energy of the intracluster medium .",
    "parallel to the merger processes , a secondary infall @xcite of gas occurs at all times onto the potential well which is being formed .",
    "the information about the virialization of the inner region of this accretion flow is propagated outwards through a so - called _",
    "accretion shock_. while merger related shocks form and propagate in the virialized gas , accretion shocks propagate in the cold ( @xmath35 ) intergalactic medium , and therefore have , almost by definition , very large mach numbers . in first approximation",
    "the position of the accretion shock is roughly coincident with the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a clear distinction between merger related shocks and accretion shocks , as seen from the perspective of nonthermal phenomena rather than from the point of view of structure formation .",
    "this classification however turns out to be useful for structure formation studies as well @xcite .",
    "a useful analytical description of this hierarchical clustering was proposed by press and schechter ( ps ) @xcite and subsequently developed , among others , by lacey and cole @xcite in the form of the so - called extended press - schechter formalism . within this approach ,",
    "the comoving number density of clusters with mass @xmath36 at cosmic time @xmath37 is given by : @xmath38 , \\label{eq : ps}\\ ] ] while the rate at which clusters of mass @xmath36 merge at a given time to form clusters with final mass @xmath39 is : @xmath40 @xmath41dm^{\\prime}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath42 is the present mean density of the universe , @xmath43 is the critical density contrast linearly extrapolated to the present time for a region that collapses at time @xmath37 , and @xmath44 is the current rms density fluctuation smoothed over the mass scale @xmath36 ( see @xcite for more details ) .    as discussed above ,",
    "shock waves form naturally in the baryonic component of clusters of galaxies involved in a merger , due to the supersonic motion of the two clusters . in @xcite",
    "we developed an analytical recipe that allows us to estimate the mach number of merger related shocks , once the masses of the two merging clusters and the redshift where the merger event occurs are given .",
    "the virial radii of the two clusters are written in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fraction of matter in the universe , compared to the critical density , @xmath47 is the hubble constant and @xmath48 is the formation redshift of the @xmath49-th cluster .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath50 of the two merging clusters , with mass @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively can be evaluated from energy conservation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the reduced mass , and @xmath55 is the turnaround radius where the clusters are supposed to be at rest with respect to each other . in an einstein - de sitter cosmology the turnaround radius is equal to twice the virial radius of the system and this result holds in approximate way also for a flat , lambda cosmology @xcite .",
    "the virial radius depends on the cluster formation redshift , that we estimate following @xcite .",
    "the sound speed in a cluster of mass @xmath56 , needed in order to evaluate the mach numbers , can be written as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the adiabatic index of the gas .    using this recipe",
    ", we can determine the probability of having a merger shock with a given mach number , simply by simulating the merger tree of a cluster with given mass today .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution of shock mach numbers , as obtained in @xcite , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : machs ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that most merger related shocks have mach number around @xmath59 . as a consequence , the spectra of particles accelerated in most merger related shocks",
    "are predicted to be extremely steep , and therefore of marginal importance from the point of view of explaining the observed nonthermal phenomena in clusters of galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong shocks expected in the case of mergers between clusters with very different masses may generate periods of large gamma ray emission lasting approximately for the same duration of the merger itself .",
    "this is expected to happen in @xmath60 of the cases , as derived from fig .",
    "[ fig : machs ] @xcite .    during the mergers , a population of newly accelerated protons",
    "is also injected in the intracluster medium .",
    "these protons can contribute high energy gamma rays through the decay of neutral pions and high energy electrons through the decay of charged pions @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", an hadronic feature might appear on top of the gamma ray emission generated by ics of electrons , even if protons are accelerated with the same efficiency as electrons .",
    "however it is important to keep in mind that the proton component can not escape the cluster volume , therefore the energy density in accelerated protons in a cluster depends wildly upon the merger history of the cluster , and on the microphysics of the shock acceleration process , as will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of the re - energization of the protons stored in the intracluster medium each time that a new merger event takes place .",
    "this problem deserves a detailed discussion _ per se _ , and we decided to dedicate a separate paper to this issue .",
    "it may be useful to summarize the content of this section as follows : structure formation occurs through hierarchical clustering , consisting of mergers of smaller clusters , which provide the largest contribution to the mass enhancement , and of accretion of matter onto the evolving potential well . both processes are characterized by the formation of shocks with very different properties : merger shocks are mostly weak and occur in the central parts of clusters , while accretion shocks form in the outskirts and have large mach numbers .",
    "the results about merger shocks , obtained in @xcite were initially discrepant to the results of numerical simulations @xcite , which found a bimodal distribution of mach numbers with two peaks at mach numbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "more recent numerical simulations @xcite found that the peak at lower mach number is in fact at @xmath21 as previously obtained with our semi - analytical calculations @xcite .",
    "the peak at larger mach numbers in @xcite is simply due to accretion shocks .",
    "these shocks were not included in our initial paper @xcite and were introduced later in a separate pubblication @xcite .",
    "as discussed in many previous papers , gamma rays can be generated in clusters of galaxies mainly through the following physical processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    * ics of electrons accelerated at merger and accretion shocks * ics of secondary electrons from the decay of charged pions produced in inelastic @xmath63 collisions * decay of neutral pions produced in inelastic @xmath63 collisions * bremsstrahlung emission of relativistic primary and secondary electrons .    due to cosmic ray confinement , protons are stored in the intracluster medium for cosmological times , and in principle can produce secondary products continuously @xcite , namely with no time correlation with phenomena like mergers of two clusters . while this process is of great importance and can be responsible for appreciable gamma ray emission , it is also quite uncertain because the amount of protons diffusively stored in the intracluster medium is determined by the history of the cluster . in the following",
    "we discuss only three of the elements that contribute to this uncertainty :    _ mergers as accelerators _",
    "different clusters have different merger histories , namely different merger trees .",
    "as stressed above , most mergers produce weak shocks , unable to efficiently energize cosmic ray particles . depending on the cluster",
    ", there may be several strong shocks formed when mergers between clusters with very different masses take place .",
    "the energy density in protons trapped within the cluster that will eventually result from several merger events occurring during its history depends on the number and strength of the shocks that accelerated those protons .",
    "_ mergers as re - accelerators _    while most electrons accelerated during a merger lose most of their energy before the next merger event , protons are simply stored in the intracluster medium and each new merger related shock re - energizes the particles trapped until that time , besides accelerating new particles .",
    "again , the merger history affects this component in a crucial way .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of the re - energized particles depends on the spectrum of the protons accelerated and re - energized by previous mergers .",
    "the spectrum of the re - accelerated particles also depends upon the minimum energy that the protons possess .",
    "these effects may change the spectrum of the accelerated particles trapped in the intracluster medium even by orders of magnitude , in particular at the highest energies , where the spectrum depends crucially on the amount of energy that crossed the few strong shocks developed during the merger history of the cluster .",
    "a corresponding uncertainty affects the secondary products of cosmic ray interactions in the intracluster medium , namely gamma rays and electrons ( positrons ) .    _",
    "additional sources _    the storage properties that clusters of galaxies exhibit for",
    "the proton component make them very sensitive to all nonthermal events occurring within the cluster .",
    "in particular , acceleration processes in radio galaxies in cluster cores pollute the intracluster medium with accelerated protons which have no connection with shocks related to structure formation .",
    "all these uncertainties can be seen as pieces of physics of the cosmic ray acceleration in clusters of galaxies that require further investigation , and will be discussed at length in a forthcoming publication . in the present paper on the other hand",
    "we adopt a conservative attitude and restrict our attention to the gamma ray emission that is solely the result of ics of relativistic electrons , accelerated at merger and accretion shocks , against photons of the cmb radiation . any contribution to the gamma ray emission from proton interactions",
    "can only increase the gamma ray fluxes derived below .",
    "we start our discussion from accretion shocks , whose role is simpler to investigate since their mach number is extremely large and the spectrum of the particles they accelerate is almost exactly a power law @xmath64 .",
    "the balance between energy losses , dominated by ics , and continuous injection of newly accelerated electrons , drives the injection spectrum towards an equilibrium spectrum that is one power steeper than the injection .",
    "the energy per unit time converted at the shock into nonthermal electrons can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the shock acceleration efficiency for electrons , fixed here at @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the free fall velocity of the gas at the virial radius @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the present mean baryonic density of the universe , if @xmath71 is the baryon fraction and @xmath72 is the critical density .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the accretion of gas onto the cluster only contributes a small fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the total final mass , which is instead mainly built up through mergers with other massive clusters .",
    "the differential gamma ray luminosity , expressed in photons per unit energy per unit time , is easily calculated as ics of the cmb photons , and is proportional to @xmath73 given above .",
    "it follows that , for a given redshift , the gamma ray luminosity is a growing function of the cluster mass , so that the number of accreting objects observable by a gamma ray telescope with sensitivity @xmath74 can be written as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the comoving volume in the redshift region between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ps ] and @xmath80 is the mass of a cluster accreting at redshift @xmath77 whose flux is @xmath74 .",
    "the case of merger shocks is slightly more complicated , due to the fact that the shock strength is a function of the masses of the clusters involved in the merger , and more specifically of the ratio of the masses .",
    "as discussed above , merger shocks are often weak , following the distribution given in fig .",
    "[ fig : machs ] .",
    "flat electron spectra , necessary to generate an appreciable gamma ray emission above @xmath1 mev , are obtained at strong shocks that form only during mergers between clusters with very different masses . in the approach presented in @xcite , at each merger",
    "events two shocks are generated , each propagating in one of the merging clusters .",
    "the mach numbers of both shocks can be calculated from the relative velocity of the clusters and if the sound speed in each cluster is known .",
    "the slopes of the spectra of the accelerated electrons easily follows as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the relevant mach number .",
    "the rate at which energy is channelled into nonthermal electrons in merger related shocks can be evaluated as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the baryonic density of the i - th cluster , @xmath85 is the surface of the shock that propagates in the i - th cluster and @xmath50 is the merger relative velocity .",

    "the vertical lines correspond to the glast , agile and egret sensitivities for point sources , as indicated in the plot .",
    "the fact that the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] overlap almost exactly is the result of a combination of many factors : each merger is on average much more luminous that accretion , because the energy involved is larger and the time during which it is released is shorter ( @xmath94 years for a merger versus the cluster lifetime for accretion ) . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the times the merger event does not result into gamma ray emission , because the shocks involved are too weak .",
    "the slight deviation from a power law at low fluxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] is the consequence of the cosmological effects in a non - euclidean geometry .",
    "the change of slope appears at larger fluxes for the mergers ( dashed line ) than for accretion .",
    "this is a result of the larger luminosity per merger that allows one to detect a bright merger from larger distances but also the consequence of the strong evolution in the merger luminosity .",
    "this latter effect is easy to explain : for a minimum cluster mass of @xmath95 , the flat spectra are obtained only when a merger occurs with a cluster of mass @xmath96 ; these clusters are already on the tail of the ps distribution at the present cosmic time , while they had not been formed yet at much earlier times . despite the larger luminosity of the mergers ( on average ) , it is interesting to notice that the gamma ray emission for the merger case is limited to the merger period or shortly after , while the gamma ray emission associated to accretion is continuous , although less intense .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath4 clusters should be detected in gamma rays above 100 mev by glast , equally distributed between merging and accreting clusters .",
    "agile on the other hand should be able to detect @xmath97 objects .",
    "moreover , we predict that no cluster should have been detected by egret , despite the recent claims of temptative association of some unidentified egret sources with the location of abell clusters @xcite .    the results summarized in fig . [ fig : counts ] are compared with the sensitivity of egret , glast and agile as obtained for point sources .",
    "this seems justified at least for gamma rays with energy around 100 mev : the gamma ray emission region in clusters is approximately a few degrees wide and the point spread function of glast at 100 mev is @xmath98 , while it reduces to @xmath99 at 10 gev @xcite .",
    "similar arguments hold even for the agile angular resolution @xcite .",
    "since our results greatly differ from some previous results , some comments and comparisons are required . in @xcite a press - schechter based method similar to the one presented in @xcite was developed in order to make predictions about the number of clusters detectable in gamma rays with energy above @xmath1 mev with future gamma ray telescopes .",
    "the authors claimed that at least a few tens of clusters should have been visible to egret .",
    "glast , on the other hand , was predicted to be able to detect more than a few thousands of such objects .",
    "this prediction seemed to be supported by some preliminary observational evidences for a temptative association between unidentified high latitude egret sources and abell clusters ( or cluster pairs ) @xcite .",
    "the statistical significance and physical plausibility of such an association was strongly questioned in @xcite , in which the important conclusion was reached that _ we still have to await the first observational evidence for the high - energy gamma - ray emission of galaxy clusters_. the lack of association between unidentified egret sources and clusters of galaxies was also found in @xcite .",
    "these findings seem to be perfectly in line with the predictions described in the present paper .    in @xcite ,",
    "all shocks were assumed to be strong . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum of the accelerated particles was always taken to be @xmath100 . as discussed above , and",
    "as described in greater details in @xcite , for merger related shocks this assumption leads to incorrect results .",
    "the gamma ray emission in @xcite is overestimated by orders of magnitude ( despite the fact that the fraction of the energy crossing the shock which is converted to nonthermal electrons is assumed to be the same as here , namely @xmath67 ) , and its spectrum does not reflect the real strength of the shocks developed during mergers of clusters of galaxies .",
    "this concept can be rephrased in another way : at fixed total energy flux crossing the merger shocks , and at fixed efficiency of electron acceleration , the nonthermal energy is distributed among accelerated particles in a different way if the spectrum of nonthermal electrons is taken to be @xmath64 rather than as the one derived from the correct evaluation of the shocks strength .",
    "the clusters that we predict to be detectable with agile and glast in gamma rays above 100 mev all have flat spectra , which means that the gamma ray emission selects the few mergers that happen to have a flat spectum of accelerated electrons ( note that for mach numbers in the range @xmath101 , the slope of the electron spectrum spans the range @xmath102 ) , in addition to the less luminous nearby accreting clusters that always generate flat spectra .",

    "in  [ sec : shock ] we showed that if electrons are accelerated diffusively across merger and accretion shocks following bhm diffusion , their maximum energy can be as high as several tens of tev , and the cmb photons can be upscattered through ics to gamma ray energies up to several tev if the magnetic field in the vicinity of the shock is in the range @xmath103 .    in this section",
    "we address the issue of detectability of the gamma rays with energy above @xmath1 gev from clusters of galaxies with cherenkov ground based detectors .",
    "the calculations of the gamma ray emission for merging and accreting clusters have already been described in the previous section .",

    "pair production starts to be important when the energy in the center of mass of a photon - photon scattering equals twice the electron mass .",

    "[ fig : cherenkov ] represent the minimum detectable fluxes for point sources ( lower curve ) and an extended @xmath113 wide source ( upper curve ) for an exposure time of 1000 hours .",
    "the exposure time here is defined as the product between the observation time and the number of cells that form the array .",
    "for instance , an exposure of 1000 hours can be achieved with a 100 hours observation performed by an array consisting of 10 cells .        if the angular resolution of the cherenkov experiment is taken to be @xmath114 degrees , most clusters of galaxies , both merging and accreting , are diffuse sources for these experiments .",
    "the angular size of a cluster at distance @xmath104 and with an emitting region of size @xmath115 mpc is @xmath116 . for accretion , the shock surface at which acceleration occurs is located approximately at the virial radius , that for a coma - like cluster is @xmath117 mpc , therefore the emission is even more extended than for a merger , and with angular size that approaches or even exceeds the aperture of the cherenkov telescopes ( a few degrees ) .    for the optimistic conditions that fig .",
    "[ fig : cherenkov ] refers to , the predicted flux of gamma rays between 100 gev and a few hundred gev for a merger between two clusters with mass ratio @xmath118 is only slightly above the sensitivity of a cherenkov telescope for a 1000 hours exposure .",
    "the predicted fluxes from accretion are unobservable .",
    "the sensitivities of the telescopes might be improved to some extent , compared with the curves in fig . [",
    "fig : cherenkov ] by simulating off - center showers and different triggering modes of the telescopes in a cell .",
    "it appears however that the perspectives for detection of tev gamma radiation from ics of ultrarelativistic electrons in clusters of galaxies are not very promising .",
    "the detection of gamma ray emission from clusters of galaxies represents one of the major goals of future gamma ray telescopes . in this paper",
    "we addressed the issue of detectability of the gamma ray signal as expected from mergers of clusters of galaxies and from the so - called secondary infall of gas onto a cluster potential well .",
    "we stressed that the two phenomena are intrinsically different both for the energy involved and for the spectra of the particles accelerated at the related shock surfaces .",
    "gamma rays can be produced mainly due to two physical processes , namely generation and decay of neutral pions in inelastic @xmath119 collisions , and inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons . in this paper",
    "we concentrated our attention on the latter process , while the full account of the gamma ray emission from hadronic processes will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the reason for separating the two calculations is the peculiar behaviour of protons ( or more generally nuclei ) that are stored in the intracluster medium for cosmological times , causing the radiation produced at any fixed time to be the result of the full history of the cluster .",
    "the situation is made more difficult by the fact that shocks related to structure formation re - energize the protons stored in the intracluster medium , besides accelerating new cosmic rays from the thermal plasma .",
    "all these processes depend on the specific history of the cluster , determined by the merger tree that the custer experiences .",
    "each shock associated to different mergers has different strength , therefore even the spectrum of the accelerated and re - accelerated particles depends on the merger history . as a result ,",
    "the energy density in cosmic rays in a cluster may change wildly from cluster to cluster .",
    "the situation is simpler for electrons accelerated during structure formation : the electrons responsible for the gamma ray emission through inverse compton upscattering of the cmb photons have energies in the range 200 gev-50 tev , whose loss time scale is between thirty thousand years and a few million years , much shorter than the time between two merger events .",
    "most electrons are therefore simply accelerated during a merger and lost to lower energies afterwards .",
    "clusters of galaxies grow mainly through mergers , but secondary infall of gas onto a cluster also contributes to the mass increase , although in a smoother way , without the billion - years - long bursts that are typical of mergers .",
    "the main differences between the gamma rays generated by particles accelerated at mergers and accretion shocks are the energy available and the spectra of accelerated particles .",
    "as found in @xcite and summarized here , merger related shocks are mostly weak , their mach number distribution having a peak at @xmath120 .",
    "these shocks generate very steep electron spectra , irrelevant from the point of view of high energy phenomena related to electrons .",
    "the only mergers able to produce flat spectra are the so - called minor mergers , consisting of the encounter of two clusters with mass ratio @xmath121 . the gamma ray emission in these events",
    "is restricted to the duration of the merger and likely limited to the shock region .",
    "the accretion shocks are located in the outskirts of clusters , at a position comparable with the virial distance from the cluster center .",
    "the energy flow per unit time across accretion shocks is smaller than that related to mergers , but it occurs continuously in time . since these shocks carry the information about the virialization of the inner regions towards the cold outer parts of the cluster , by definition their mach number can be very high , @xmath122 . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum of the particles accelerated at these shocks all have spectrum @xmath64 ( note that the equilibrium spectrum , due to the balance between injection and losses is one power steeper than the injection spectrum ) .",
    "we calculated the @xmath92 distribution of merging and accreting clusters of galaxies and compared the expected fluxes with the sensitivities of egret , agile and glast .",
    "we found that no cluster was expected to be detected by egret , confirming a recent analysis of the old egret data from the direction of several abell clusters , for which only upper limits on the gamma ray emission could be inferred @xcite .",
    "our calculation strongly disagrees with previous results found in @xcite , for the reasons explained in  [ sec : space ] .",
    "the perspectives for detection appear to be more promising for future space - borne gamma ray telescopes , such as agile and glast .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath97 clusters should be detected by agile and @xmath4 clusters should appear in glast data , equally shared between merging and accreting clusters if an efficiency of @xmath60 can be achieved in accelerating electrons at the shocks .    in principle",
    ", the gamma ray emission due to ics of ultrarelativistic electrons can extend to a few tens of tev , so that clusters might be seen in future ground based cherenkov experiments such as veritas and hess .",
    "unfortunately , only nearby ( @xmath123 ) merging clusters of galaxies are expected to be detectable , while the detection of accreting clusters appears more problematic .",
    "we thank gianfranco brunetti for many useful discussions and ongoing collaboration .",
    "we are also grateful to felix aharonian for constructive correspondence about cherenkov experiments and to tom jones and dongsu ryu for updating us on their work .",
