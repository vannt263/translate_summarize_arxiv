    "solar - like pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars and , in general , the low mass pms stars ( m@xmath6 ) , or t  tauri stars ( ttss ) , are complex dynamical systems made of two basic components , star and accretion disk , as well as a dynamical interface , the stellar magnetosphere ( see gmez de castro 2013 , for a recent review ) .",
    "magnetic fields of few kg have been detected in the surface of the ttss ( guenther et al 1999 ; johns - krull et al 1999 ; johns - krull 2007 ) .",
    "the surface field is not bipolar but it has a rather complex structure as the sun s field has ( johns - krull et al 2004 ) .",
    "hence , though higher order , multi - polar components fall off more rapidly with radius than the dipolar field , it is difficult to track the final path followed by matter from the inner disk border to the stellar surface .",
    "in addition , the magnetosphere has its own dynamics and forcing due to the interaction with the disk .",
    "unfortunately , the characteristics of the ttss extended atmosphere and magnetospheres are still escaping the diagnosis ( see hartmann 2009 ) .",
    "little is known about them , apart from having a density of @xmath7  @xmath8 and an electron temperature between some few thousand kelvin and 100,000  k ( gmez de castro & verdugo 2007 , hereafter gdcv2007 ) .",
    "recent attempts to derive the magnetospheric properties from optical lines have shown that , for instance , the h@xmath9 profile is strongly dependent on densities and temperatures assumed inside the magnetosphere and in the disk wind reagion ( lima et al .",
    "the line widths of typical atmospheric / magnetospheric tracers are about 200 - 300 km / s that exceed by far what expected from thermal or rotational broadening even if the lines are assumed to be formed in a magnetosphere that extends to some 4 - 5 stellar radii and corotates with the star . as today",
    ", it is still unclear whether the broadening is produced by unresolved macroscopic flows or by magnetic waves propagating on the magnetospheric field ( hartmann et al .",
    "in general , the broadening of magnetospheric tracers does not vary significantly in time , pointing out that the average motions are rather stable .",
    "the combined effect of funnel flows and inclined magnetic rotators as simulated by romanova et al ( 2004,2012 ) is the current baseline for the numerical simulation of ttss magnetospheres .",
    "the stellar field is assumed to be anchored in the inner part of the disk creating a sheared layer between the rigid body rotation of the star and the keplerian rotation of the disk .",
    "this interaction has a profound influence on the star and the accretion flow but also acts as a dynamo that transform part of the angular momentum excess in the inner disk into magnetic field amplification that self - regulates through quiescent periods of field building - up and eruptions when the energy excess is released ( see gmez de castro & von rekowsky 2011 , for an evaluation of the uv output from such interface ) .",
    "however , magnetospheric heating processes are poorly known and accretion shock models are unable to predict the observed line fluxes / broadening ( johns - krull 2009 ) .",
    "the atmospheric and magnetospheric energy output is released mainly in the ultraviolet .",
    "the richness of spectral tracers for a broad range of magnetospheric temperatures and densities is unmatched by any other range .",
    "there are several studies of the atmospheric / magnetospheric properties of the ttss based on low dispersion uv data ( lemmens et al .",

    "however , only the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) ( see green et al 2012 for a description of the instrument ) , on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , has been sensitive enough to gather high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) profiles of hot plasma tracers such as the n  v [ uv1 ] resonance multiplet or the he  ii h@xmath9 transition with a resolution above 10,000 in late k and m - type ttss ( see penston & lago 1984 for c  iv profiles obtained with the iue , ardila et al 2002 , for hst profiles obtained with the goddard high resolution spectrograph and ayres 2005 , for the coolcat set based on hst data obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph and compare them with the presented in sect .  2 ) .    following a previous work where the magnetospheric properties of ttss were examined based on low dispersion hst data ( gdcma2012 ) , the high resolution profiles of the n  v [ uv1 ] , o  iii ] and he  ii(1640  ) transitions are analysed in this work with two main objectives .",
    "firstly , it is intended to determine whether it is feasible to discriminate the contribution to the high energy radiation flux from the high density atmospheric plasma and from the accretion flow . moreover ,",
    "the unexpected correlation between x - ray flux and the high energy uv tracers found by gdcma2012 is re - examined on the light of the kinematic information contained in the high resolution hst / cos profiles . in sect .",
    "2 the observations are described .",
    "the results are presented in sect .",
    "two components are found to contribute to the he  ii flux a low density component ( ldc ) associated with the accretion flow and a high density component ( hdc ) of more uncertain origin .",
    "the discussion on the possible source of the hdc , its association with accretion shocks and the properties of the ldc are addressed in sect .",
    "the article concludes with a brief summary on the relevance of these results .",
    "the he  ii profiles of ttss in the taurus - aurigae star forming region have been retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "only high resolution observations have been considered .",
    "most of them have been obtained with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) and the gratings g130 m and g160 m .",
    "the resolution is @xmath1024,000 and each target has been observed three times with slight offsets in the wavelength range to guarantee that the 18.1  gap between the two segments in the fuv detector is covered ( see cos handbook ) .",
    "moreover , some few ttss have been observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , namely , t  tau , dr  tau , and df  tau .",
    "only the t  tau profile had a high enough signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the he  ii line to be considered for this work .",
    "the log of the observations is provided in table 1 ; additional information on the hst programs that obtained these observations ( programs ids . 11533 , 11616 and 8627 ) can also be found in the table .",
    "the observational strategy allowed to search for variations in the profiles in time scales of @xmath11 minutes but neither flux , nor morphology were found to display significant changes .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra produced by the cos calibration pipeline ( calcos v2.17.3 ) were aligned and co - added .",
    "cos targets must be centred to within @xmath12 arcsec to achieve the nominal wavelength accuracy of @xmath13  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the ( r(3 )  1 - 7 ) 1489.636    and ( p(5 )  1 - 7 ) 1504.845     h@xmath14 lines have been used to set the zero of the wavelength scale for the targets in table  1 .",
    "h@xmath14 emission is dominated by the molecular disk around the stars in most sources ( france et al .",
    "the lines have been selected to be strong ( from herczeg et al .",
    "2002 ) and detectable in most of the sources .",
    "the profiles of the 1489.636    line are plotted in figure  1 ( see also figure  3 in france et al .  2012 ) and the he  ii profiles are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "no shifts have been applied to dn  tau and ip  tau observations because the h@xmath14 emission was too weak to be used for this purpose .",
    "neither shifts have been applied to hbc  427 , lkca  19 and lkca  4 because h@xmath14 emission was not detected .",
    "the h@xmath14 profiles are sometimes asymmetric with respect to the rest wavelength , very especially in rw  aur . in this case",
    ", the original zero from the calcos pipeline has been left .",
    "only a subset of aa  tau observations has been used since guide star acquisition failed ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . as a result",
    ", the first two exposures produced similar profiles while the last one produces a slightly broader and more red - shifted ( by @xmath15  or 18  km  s@xmath2 at 1640  ) profile . for this star , the last observation was rejected and only the two first observations were averaged to produce the profiles in figs .  1 and 2 .    the he  ii profiles can be generically described as composed of a bright and narrow emission feature and a broad , weaker component that differs from one star to another .",
    "notice that the he  ii lines are very strong ; this fact , together with the strong h@xmath14 emission , contributes to the continuum jump in the low resolution advanced camera system on hst reported by gdcma2012 .",
    "close to the he  ii line , there are the o  iii]@xmath16 intercombination lines ; a doublet with components at @xmath17 and 1666.156 , which originate under transitions from the level 2s2p@xmath18 @xmath19s@xmath14 to the term 2s@xmath202p@xmath20 @xmath18p with j=1 and j=2 , respectively .",
    "the components should have an intensity ratio @xmath211:3 ; equal to the ratio of their transition probabilities ( 145  s@xmath2 and 426  s@xmath2 ) .",

    "the o  iii ] profiles are represented in fig .",
    "the two lines of the multiplet are observed in gm  aur , df  tau , hn  tau , dr  tau , su  aur , rw  aur and de  tau ; however the flux of the weakest , 1660.802    line , has only been measured for strong sources . in all cases ,",
    "the flux ratio between the two lines of the multiplet is 1:3 ( within the error bars ) .    to complete the view on the distribution of hot plasma in the ttss environment , also the profiles of the resonance uv  1 multiplet of the n  v",
    "have been retrieved from the hst archive ( see table  2 ) . in the blue edge of the 1238.8    line , the strongest in the doublet , there are some narrow emission lines produced by molecular hydrogen ( lines : @xmath23  1 - 2 p(8 ) , @xmath24  2 - 2 r(11 ) ) that somewhat blur the profile .",
    "the zero of the wavelength scale has been set again , resourcing to h@xmath14 emission lines .",
    "the ( p(2 )  0 - 4 ) 1338.63    line has been used for this purpose , since it is strong in most of the stars and it is not blended with other features ( see figure  5 with the h@xmath14 profiles ) . as mentioned above ,",
    "the original zero of the wavelength scale has not been shifted for dn  tau , ip  tau , hbc  427 , lkca  19 and lkca  4 because the h@xmath14 lines were either very weak or absent .",
    "the n  v profiles can be most generally described by a single component that ranges from being narrow in stars like hbc  427 , lkca  19 and lkca  4 to be broad and asymmetric in aa  tau or gm  aur ( see fig .",
    ".    some relevant properties of the ttss to be used in sect .",
    "3 are gathered in table  3 .",
    "notice that there are wide variations in published values of important parameters such as the stellar luminosity or the extinction ( see also comments in gdcma2012 ) ; data in table  3 are gathered for reference for other researchers .",
    "the x - ray fluxes have been retrieved from the xmm - newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud ( xest ) ( guedel et al .",
    "the he  ii , the 1238.82    n  v and the o  iii ] lines fluxes have been measured after subtracting the local continuum .",
    "also the fluxes for the 1489.636 and 1338.63 h@xmath14 lines have measured ( see sect .",
    "5).the lines fluxes are provided in table  4 ; they are not extinction corrected .",
    "for some sources , the measurement of the 1238.82    n  v flux has required subtracting the nearby h@xmath14 features . in such cases , the h@xmath14 flux has been subtracted by linear interpolation in the n  v profile",
    ". however , there are some few profiles where this linear interpolation was uncertain ( see quality flags in table 4 ) .",
    "from figures 1 to 6 a generic trend can be inferred :    * the _ weak - line ttss ( wttss ) _ in the sample , _",
    "i.e. _ evolved ttss with no evidence of mass infall ( lkca  19 , lkca  4 , hbc  427 ) , do not display h@xmath14 emission , neither nebular o  iii ] emission .",
    "they have only rather narrow he  ii and n  v lines . * _ intermediate objects ( ttss ) _ like ip  tau , dn  tau and v836  tau have weak h@xmath14 and no nebular o  iii ] emission .",
    "both he  ii and n  v lines have narrow emission profiles . *",
    "_ the classical ttss ( cttss ) _ emit in all these tracers ( see below ) .",
    "cttss cover a broad range of profiles morphologies .",
    "strong h@xmath14 emission is detected in all of them and the lines are narrow unless in rw  aur  a ( see france et al 2012 ) .",
    "nebular o  iii ] emission is detected in all of them unless in dm  tau , ux  tau  a and aa  tau .",
    "o  iii ] is especially strong in t  tau , df  tau , hn  tau , dr  tau and rw  aur .",
    "su  aur , and de  tau seem to be intermediate objects .",
    "hints of possible o  iii ] emission at 1666    are seen in gm  aur , unfortunately the s / n is low and the weakest component of the multiplet is not detected . a low s / n",
    "feature is detected at 1666  aa in dn  tau , ip  tau , aa  tau and ux  tau spectra .",
    "observations of the c  iii ] intercombination transition line are only available for three of the stars in the sample , namely , de  tau , t  tau and rw  aur and no significant differences have been found between the o  iii ] and the c  iii ] profiles obtained either with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) ( compare fig .  4 with fig.1 in gmez de castro et al 2001 ) and stis ( compare fig .  4 with fig.1 in gmez de castro et al 2003 ) .    in general , the he  ii profiles can be described by a narrow emission component superimposed on a broader contribution that mimics the observed in the o  iii ] nebular lines , when high enough s / n data profiles are observed .",
    "this effect is clearly apparent in hn  tau and rw  aur .",
    "note that in dr  tau and df  tau , the overlap is lost at bluewards shifted velocities ; there is bluewards shifted o  iii ] emission with no he  ii counterpart .",
    "this bluewards shifted excess could be caused by the contribution of an unresolved jet to the line emission .",
    "as shown for ry  tau by gdcv2003 , the semiforbidden emission has two components : one associated with the jet and another with the accretion flow that were disentangled for this source due to their variability .",
    "the n  v profiles however , do not follow the same morphological trend .",
    "a rather narrow symmetric profile is observed in de  tau that becomes wider in dm  tau , df  tau , ux  tau  a , gm  aur and su  aur , all of them sources with absent or weak o  iii ] nebular emission .",
    "dr  tau , hn  tau , rw  aur and aa  tau display very peculiar profiles that clearly indicate that n  v emission is not produced in the stellar atmosphere but in another dynamical component .",
    "in particular , the n  v profiles of rw  aur , hn  tau and aa  tau are asymmetric extending from red - wards shifted velocities to peak at blue - wards shifted velocities ; moreover , the rw  aur profile peaks at the velocity of the optical jet ( hirth et al 1997 ) that was also detected in the c  iii ] intercombination line by gmez de castro & verdugo , 2003 .",
    "this type of profile asymmetry has also been detected in the c  iii ] profile of ry  tau ( gdcv2007 ) , who pointed out that the line could be formed in a pre - main sequence analogue of the solar wind . in this context",
    ", it is worth remarking that the h@xmath14 profile of rw  aur has a completely different asymmetry , the flux peaks to the red of the line , suggesting the presence of infalling cold molecular gas similar to that observed in the pre - main sequence close binary ak  sco ( see also gmez de castro et al 2013 ) .",
    "these groups can be cleanly recognised in velocity dispersion diagrams .",
    "the characterisation of the underlying velocity field and thermal properties of the line emission region is complex in the ttss environment . instead of using the standard fitting to gaussian or voight profiles , it is preferable to characterise the profile in terms of the standard pearson statistics moments and measures , i.e. , mean or centroid , dispersion , kurtosis and skewness .",
    "they provide a quantitative measurement of the deviation of the profile from the expected for a thermal plasmas ; a normal distribution convolved with the line spread function ( lsf ) of cos ( kriss 2011 ) .",
    "note that in this approach , the profile is assumed to be formed by the contribution to the line flux of independent gas parcels , _",
    "i.e. _ the ( background subtracted ) profile is treated as a histogram of the flux emitted per parcel in the wavelength ( velocity ) space ; a similar approach was followed by gdcv2007 to compare the observed c  iii ] and si  iii ] profiles of ry  tau with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this treatment permits to characterise the profiles that are formed in complex velocity fields . in table  5",
    ", the dispersions of the he  ii and n  v lines are provided together with that obtained for two control lines , the h@xmath14 transitions at 1339  and 1489 ; rw  aur , hn  tau and aa  tau are not included because their n  v profiles are peculiar . as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "8 , the average dispersion of the h@xmath14 profiles is @xmath25  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath26  km  s@xmath2 for the 1339  and 1489  lines , respectively .",
    "there is not any correlation between the broadening of these two h@xmath14 lines , pointing out that the scattering of the dispersions in the diagram is related with random effects associated with the measurement process .",
    "a different trend is drawn from the n  v and he  ii dispersions .",
    "the dispersions of the wttss and dn  tau are comparable to those measured in the h@xmath14 line . in intermediate objects , like v836tau and ip  tau ,",
    "the dispersions in the he  ii line are comparable to those measured in the h@xmath14 lines but the n  v lines are significantly broader .",
    "finally in the cttss both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are larger than @xmath29 .",
    "note that stellar rotation may contribute to the line dispersion ; su  aur , the fastest rotator in the sample has also the largest dispersion .",
    "however , a large dispersion can also be produced by the profile asymmetry .",
    "for instance , dm  tau has dispersions comparable to those measured in su  aur and it is one of the slowest rotators in the sample ( see table  3 ) .",
    "two objects do not follow this trend : dr  tau and de  tau , both have intermediate dispersions in the n  v lines and large dispersions in the he  ii lines caused by the broad emission component . a quick inspection in the summary of the ttss properties ( see table  3 ) indicates that the only possible cause of this discrepancy is the high accretion rate , as otherwise , expected .      from figures 2 , 4 and 6 ,",
    "it is clearly inferred that there are , at least , two different plasmas contributing to the spectral lines under study :    * _ a low density component ( ldc ) _ that it is most conspicuously traced by the o  iii ] line .",
    "the ldc also produces the he  ii broad emission component observed in rw  aur , hn  tau , dr  tau and df  tau .",
    "the critical density of the o  iii ] sets an upper limit to the electron density of the plasma in the ldc of @xmath30@xmath8 , ( see also sect .",
    "the ldc profiles display a non - thermal broadening and draw a complex velocity field around the stars , i.e. , it is not associated to a simple standing atmospheric structure whose kinematics is dominated by stellar rotation .",
    "in fact , the ldc profiles seem to rather trace some kind of complex magnetospheric infalling pattern , high above the stellar surface . also , in some cases , could be associated to unresolved wind structures ( gmez de castro & ferro - fontn 2005 ) , as the reported for ry  tau ( gdcv2007 ) .",
    "notice that the co - existence of o  iii ] and he  ii radiation from the same kinematic structure would point out an unrealistically high electron temperatures for the line emission region ( @xmath31 ) , if collisional equilibrium at a single temperature is assumed and electron densities below the o  iii ] critical density are considered .",
    "in fact , its uv spectrum is reminiscent of that observed in photoionized nebulae ( see also sect .",
    "to the current sensitivity , the contribution of this component to the n  v flux is negligible . * _ a high density / temperature component ( hdc ) _ that dominates the n  v emission .",
    "o  iii ] profiles are very different from n  v profiles suggesting that the density is of the n  v formation region is higher than the o  iii ] critical density .",
    "though the kinematics of the n  v emission region is clearly different from that traced by the ldc , the n  v flux is correlated with the he  ii flux as shown in fig .",
    "9 ; the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath32 ( with significance level , @xmath33 , see sachs 1982 for details ) and , + @xmath34 with rms = 0.29 ( see bottom panel in fig .  9 ) .",
    "also the fluxes normalised to the stellar surface are correlated with @xmath35 , with @xmath36 ( see top panel in fig .",
    "9 ) and , + @xmath37 with an rms=0.31 .",
    "the normalised flux is defined as the rate @xmath38 or @xmath39 and was introduced by gdcma2021 to provide a measure of the line emissivity weighted over an unknown thickness but corrected from stellar radii and surface temperature . in this manner , the normalised fluxes compensate for scaling effects associated with the broad range of mass , luminosity and stellar radius covered by the ttss .",
    "stars whose he  ii flux has a significant contribution from the ldc are marked in the plot .",
    "notice that they are evenly distributed in the figure suggesting that he  ii and n  v fluxes are correlated , independently of whether the he  ii flux is dominated by the narrow emission component .",
    "based on low resolution observations , gdcma2012 pointed out that the normalised he  ii flux anti correlates with the strength of the x - ray flux as derived in the xest survey ( guedel et al 2007 ) carried out with the xmm - newton telescope in the 0.3 - 10.0  kev band . in fig .",
    "10 , the normalised he  ii fluxes from the high resolution cos / hst observation ( see table  3 ) are represented against the normalised x - ray luminosities as derived from the xest survey .",
    "also the chandra / acis observations of lkca  4 , de  tau , gm  aur from yang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) are used ; they are integrated x - ray luminosities in the 0.3 - 10  kev range .",
    "the he  ii flux has been extinction corrected according to valencic et al ( 2004 ) assuming r=3.1 and extinctions in table  3 .",
    "the low dispersion , gdcma2012 data , have been also plotted for those sources with no available high dispersion data .",
    "there is significant contribution to the he  ii flux from the ldc in some few sources : su  aur , hn  tau , de  tau and dm tau , that are marked in the figure .",
    "a first inspection of the fig  10 , shows three groups .",
    "the wttss ( hbc  427 , lkca  4 , hd283472 ) , ux  tau and the fast rotator su  aur are very close to the main sequence stars regression line .",
    "the cttss follow the generic trend pointed out by gdcma2012 , the he  ii flux increases as the x - ray flux decreases .",
    "notice that the sources with strong ldcs are far from this trend , excluding the fast rotator su  aur .",
    "if hn  tau , de  tau and dm tau are excluded , the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , and the least square fit is , @xmath42 with rms = 0.15 .",
    "uncertainties in the a@xmath43 values may produce a shift towards large @xmath44 in the plot reinforcing the trend ; note that the regression line runs nearly parallel to the extinction direction . to examine its effect ,",
    "the same diagram has been plotted in the bottom panel of fig  10 using , stellar luminosities , x - ray luminosities and a@xmath43 values from the recent compilation by yang et al ( 2012 ) . as shown , the three groups are no so cleanly separated and the regression line is more clear ; only de  tau is far from the trend and has been excluded from the calculation .",
    "the results are similar though the negative slope is softer : @xmath45 with rms = 0.15 and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .    in summary , though the clean separation between wttss and accreting ttss may be an extinction associated effect , the trend to release preferentially the high energy excess in the uv rather than in the x - ray channel in accreting objects holds with the only possible exception of the sources with a strong contribution the he  ii flux from the ldc .    from the current data sets and observations , it can not be ascertain whether there is a statistically meaningful deviation of the sources with strong ldcs from the main trend .",
    "unfortunately , there are not x - ray measurements of dr  tau or df  tau and rw  aur was only detected to have a low soft x - ray flux with the einstein satellite ( damiani et al 1995 ) . if present , such a trend could indicate that x - ray radiation is dominated by different components in sources with strong ldcs ( strong nebular component ) and in sources with weak or absent ldcs .",
    "the x - rays energy distribution of the ttss is often modelled by two components : a soft component at @xmath48  k and a hard component at @xmath49  k ( see i.e. glassgold et al , 2000 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray component is thought to be associated with magnetic energy release in the stellar coronae .",
    "the nature of the soft x - ray component is more uncertain and often , it has been hypothesised that could be formed in accretion shocks ( lamzin 1998 , gullbring et al 1998 ) . unfortunately",
    ", only three stars in our sample namely , t  tau , su  aur and hbc  427 have a high enough count rate to allow a spectral fitting to two different optically thin plasmas and non - conclusive results could be derived from the fits ( see table  6 with the two - components fit to the x - ray spectrum of these sources ( from table  6 in guedel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of su  aur , a ctts , is dominated by the low temperature component with t=5.22  mk however , both soft and hard x - ray component , have similar emission measures in hbc  427,a non - accreting wttss . moreover , the hard x - ray component dominates the x - ray spectrum of the ctts , t  tau .",
    "ttss are complex objects ; they are convective pms stars where a solar - like dynamo begins to set in , while still the fossil magnetic field is diffusing .",
    "ttss are surrounded by an external dynamo that powers and makes rise the stellar magnetosphere to the inner border of the molecular disk ( see romanova et al 2012 for recent simulations ) .",
    "matter from the disk , slides down onto the star along the magnetospheric field lines to end , free - falling onto the open holes of the magnetic configuration . in this environment",
    ", hot plasma radiating in the uv tracers studied in this work can be located in the magnetosphere , in the atmosphere , in the accretion shocks and also in the outflow ( either solar - like or driven from the star - disk magnetic interface or the disk ) .",
    "both , magnetosphere and outflow , have significantly lower densities than the stellar atmosphere or the accretion shocks ; as a result , spectral lines radiation is dominated by radiative de - excitation processes and forbidden and semiforbidden transitions are strong from this plasma . in the dense atmosphere , collisional de - excitation is relevant and forbidden transitions are quenched .",
    "uv semiforbidden transitions can not be observed from the accretion shock itself , because it is too hot and dense however , the soft x - ray radiation produced in the shock front photoionizes the preshock gas , which has a density similar to that of the stellar magnetosphere and may produce forbidden lines radiation ( gmez de castro & lamzin , 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the high column density prevents the uv radiation from the photoionization cascade to escape easily from the accretion column .",
    "also , the profiles of some tracers , from the infrared he i transition ( beristain et al . 2001 , fisher et al . 2008 ) to the uv lines do not agree with the predictions of accretion shock models ( johns - krull 2009 ) . within this context , the data presented in sect .",
    "3 provide some amazing results :    *",
    "the he  ii , o  iii ] and n  v fluxes do not depend on the spectral type .",
    "this confirms that _ the line emission is not dominated by main sequence like atmospheric magnetic activity _ , _ i.e. _ with the release of the magnetic energy produced by the stellar dynamo , since this one depends on the spectral type ( see e.g. ayres et al 1995 and gdcm2012 ) .",
    "* the he  ii and n  v fluxes correlate well independently of whether the line profiles are very different , _",
    "e.g. _ , independently of whether the line emission is produced in the same physical structure .",
    "this confirms that all processes ( accretion , atmospheric emission and outflow ) are coupled , as otherwise expected ( see gomez de castro 2013 for a recent review ) . in turn",
    ", it makes difficult to get specific tracers of individual processes without the kinematical information , _",
    "i.e. _ without high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "* the high resolution profiles of the n  v line show a symmetric line broadening that increases from non accreting to accreting stars , being significantly suprathermal in these last sources ( see table  5 ) . the profile shape and",
    "the density of the line formation region suggests an atmospheric origin ( with the exceptions already mentioned in sect .",
    "the connection between line broadening and accretion suggests that the density and extent of the high atmospheric layers depends on the accretion rate , _",
    "i.e. _ on the evolutionary state , as otherwise predicted from the theoretical models ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , siess et al 2000 )",
    ". transport of magnetic energy from the stellar interior to the surface is expected to occur at a different pace in accreting sources than in wttss .",
    "moreover , the extended magnetosphere powered by the disk - star magnetic locking , must affect the stellar atmosphere introducing new sources of stirring and turbulence ( see e.g. kivelson & russell , 1995 ) .",
    "* however , the physical source of the narrow emission component in the he  ii profile keeps being uncertain .",
    "it could either be associated with accretion shocks or with atmospheric features .    in this section ,",
    "the possible source of the he  ii narrow emission component is analysed as well as some constraints on the extent of the magnetosphere inferred from the semiforbidden line radiation .",
    "the kinematics of the region where the narrow component forms , is clearly distinct from that of the n  v or the o  iii ] lines formation region ( see fig",
    "the dispersion of the narrow emission component of the he  ii ranges from @xmath11  km  s@xmath2 to @xmath50  km  s@xmath2 while the dispersion of the n  v line varies varies from @xmath51  km  s@xmath2 to @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 for the same sources ( see fig .",
    "the dispersion of the narrow emission component in the he  ii profile has been evaluated as above ( see sect.3 ) but setting an upper wavelength cut - off to reject the contribution of the ldc .",
    "note that even setting this cut - off there is an unknown contribution from the ldc to the flux .",
    "moreover , the narrow component seems to be slightly redshifted in _ all _ sources , from 24  km  s@xmath2 in ux  tau to 37  km  s@xmath2 in de  tau ( see appendix  1 and table  7 ) .",
    "hence , it would be tempting to suggest that the line is produced in accretion shocks .",
    "accretion shocks are produced by the impact of the free - falling material from the disk onto the stellar surface .",
    "the kinetic energy of the infalling matter , with typical free - fall speeds of @xmath53  km  s@xmath2 is involved into gas heating at the shock front that reaches temperatures of about 1mk .",
    "the soft x - ray radiation from the shock front is expected to photoionize ( pre - ionize ) the infalling gas column ( see i.e. lamzin 1998 , gmez de castro & lamzin 1999 , muzerolle et al 2001 , orlando et al 2009 ) . also , the shock front could back illuminate the stellar surface , becoming a source of atmospheric photoionization to be added to the coronal x - ray radiation . in this context , the narrow component of the he  ii line could be produced very close to the shock front .",
    "the slight , but small redshift , could be interpreted as an indication of the line being formed in postshock material , and the small width could be caused by thermal broadening ; the thermal velocity of fully ionized , solar abundance plasma at 50,000  k is 23  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , this can not be concluded from these data alone .",
    "firstly , the apparent redshift could be caused by the blending of the narrow component with the broad component which is asymmetric in most sources , _",
    "e. g. _ , with very low or absent flux at bluewards shifted velocities .",
    "the line broadening is affected by the same problem though no",
    "so dramatically given the relative strengths of the narrow and broad components . unfortunately ,",
    "unless very high s / n profiles ( @xmath54 ) of the semiforbidden and the he  ii lines are obtained , any fitting is hampered by these uncertainties . finally , it is also , intriguing that the broadening of the he  ii emission line in non - accreting ttss , such as lkca  4 , lkca  19 and hbc  427 , is comparable to the observed in ux  tau or in v836  tau that are ttss with low accretion rates . in this respect , it is worth noticing that the correlation between the he  ii flux and the accretion luminosity , as derived from the u - band excess ( ingleby et al 2009 , gullbring et al 1998 ) is mild , as shown in fig .  12 ( see also gdcma2012 ) .",
    "taking into account all these facts , as well as the good correlation between the he  ii and the n  v fluxes ( fig .",
    "9 ) and the convergence of the he  ii and n  v lines broadenings towards the non - accreting wttss , a contribution to the narrow component of the he  ii line from the stellar atmosphere can not be neglected . in summary ,",
    "the data analysed in this work are non - conclusive concerning the source of the narrow component of the he  ii line .",
    "for all the reasons mentioned above , it is most probable that both physical components , accretion shocks and stellar atmosphere , contribute to the flux .",
    "the profiles produced in the ldc can not be ascribed to a simple kinematics shared by all sources , neither the radiating plasma can be modelled by simple collisional plasma models .",
    "however , some constraints on its overall physical properties can be derived from the ratios of the intercombination lines of o  iii ] , si  iii ] and c  iii ] .",
    "the plasma density can be constrained from the si  iii]@xmath55c  iii ] ratio ( gmez de castro & verdugo 2001 ) .",
    "the detection of o  iii]@xmath56 can be used to fix up the temperature since the o  iii]@xmath55si  iii ] ratio is very sensitive to it .",
    "the si  iii ] and c  iii ] lines have been observed with stis for three sources in the sample : rw  aur ( gmez de castro & verdugo 2003 , hereafter gdcv2003 ) , de  tau and t  tau ( gmez de castro et al 2003 ) .",
    "t  tau profiles display a non - negligible contribution from the large scale jet .",
    "de  tau si  iii ] and c  iii ] profiles are rather narrow and similar to the o  iii ] line . from rw",
    "aur study , gdcv2003 pointed out that the emitting volume is clumpy with a rather small filling factor , as otherwise expected if magnetospheric radiation is produced in plasma filaments and clumps .",
    "this clumpy nature together with the broad temperature range covered by the various spectral tracers suggest that the excitation mechanism could be photoionization instead of collisional excitation .",
    "gdcv2003 produced two grids of photonionization models to explore possible regimes for line excitation making use of cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) , a code designed to simulate emission line regions in astrophysical environments .",
    "the first set assumed that ldc had a belt like geometry , being illuminated by the ambient x - ray radiation field : soft and hard components , at @xmath57  k and 2.8@xmath58  k respectively , with a total x - rays luminosity of @xmath59  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this model turned out to be unable to reproduce comparable strengths of the three spectral tracers .",
    "however , if the o  iii ] , si  iii ] and c  iii ] emission is assumed to be produced in dense gas around small x - ray sources , such as reconnecting loops , the lines ratios could be reproduced for electron densities of @xmath60  @xmath8 . for soft x - ray sources , with t@xmath61  k ,",
    "luminosities of @xmath62  erg  s@xmath2 and radii of 10@xmath63  @xmath8 , the inferred o  iii ] emissivity is @xmath64 erg  s  @xmath65 . using this one as a fiducial value ,",
    "an estimate of the ldc volume , @xmath66 could be derived from the line strength as , @xmath67 ) 4 \\pi d^2}{\\epsilon _ { o iii]}}$ ] where @xmath68)$ ] is the reddening corrected line flux and @xmath69 is the filling factor of the hot plasma . for filling factors of 10 , and assuming that the emission is concentrated in a spherical shell of radius r@xmath70 and thickness 0.01r@xmath70 , ldc radii from 4 to 9 r@xmath71 are inferred .",
    "these values are within a factor of 1.5 of the magnetospheric radii derived from accretion luminosities for stars with known magnetic fields ( johns - krull 2007 , gdcma2012 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties in the plasma distribution prevent more detailed evaluations .",
    "the uv radiation from n  v , he  ii and o  iii ] is dominated by the contribution of three main components of the ttss atmospheric / magnetospheric environment : the magnetospheric flow of infalling matter , the disturbed upper atmospheric layers and the accretion shock .",
    "the diffuse magnetospheric plasma ( ldc ) is best traced by the o  iii ] line : it produces asymmetric profiles , preferentially red - shifted .",
    "he  ii emission is observed from the same kinematical structures that radiate in o  iii ] .",
    "this plasma is not excited by thermal collisions at a single electron temperature .",
    "in fact , there are indications that photoionization processes could be significant .",
    "the hot , dense layers of the stellar atmosphere are best traced by the n  v line . however , the line dispersion increases steadily with the accretion rate suggesting a connection between the disturbances in the upper atmospheric layers and the accretion flow .",
    "the he  ii flux is dominated by a narrow emission component of uncertain origin . in this work ,",
    "we have presented evidences indicating that it may be formed in hot postshock material in accretion shocks but also , evidences of its connection with atmospheric tracers .",
    "both accretion shocks and the upper atmospheric layers seem to contribute to the narrow component of the he  ii profile .",
    "the anticorrelation between x - ray and uv flux found but gdcma2012 has been confirmed , suggesting that the dissipation of magnetic energy proceeds in the ttss differently than in main sequence stars .",
    "the denser environment produced by mass accretion ( see i.e. petrov et al .",
    "2011 ) seems to favour the ultraviolet channel for the dissipation of the magnetic energy excess .",
    "all the observations indicate that the uv radiation field during pms evolution is much harder than the usually implemented in the modelling of protostellar disks evolution .",
    "an example of its effect in the dust grains charging and charging profile can be found in pedersen & gmez de castro 2011 .",
    "theoretical modelling of protostellar disks chemistry and life generation environments should take this fact into account .",
    "kevin france brought to my attention the hst / cos data corresponding to aa  tau .",
    "the analysis of the data pointed out that the 1640  jump in the hst / acs data was dominated by an unexpectedly strong he  ii line .",
    "this article has grown from extending this analysis to the ttss observed with hst / cos .",
    "i would like to thank an anonymous referee for suggesting the use of the h@xmath14 lines to set the zero of the wavelength scale .",
    "this work has been partly funded by the ministerio de economia y competitividad of spain through grant aya2011 - 29754-c03-c01 .",
    "the narrow emission component of the he  ii line seems to be systematically red - shifted with respect to the h@xmath14 lines .",
    "the shifts are small ( @xmath72    or 29  km  s@xmath2 ) as shown in table  8 .",
    "the zero of the wavelength scale has been set with the ( r(3 )  1 - 7 ) 1489.636    and ( p(5 )  1 - 7 ) 1504.845     h@xmath14 lines because they were observed in most of the stars .",
    "these lines are far from the 1640    he  ii line and , in principle , small uncertainties in the wavelength calibration could drive to these shifts . however , as shown in figures 14 and 15 , this is not the case .",
    "the p(17)3 - 9 line is plotted for the whole sample in figure  14 though only is clearly observed in : dm  tau , ux  tau  a , aa  tau , gm  aur and dr  tau ( the h@xmath14 emission from rw  aur can not be used for this purpose ) . in all cases ,",
    "the h@xmath14 transition is at rest . in figure  15 , the c  i[uv1 ]",
    "multiplet is plotted .",
    "it is observed as narrow emission lines in dn  tau , dm  tau , ux  tau  a and df  tau . in all cases ,",
    "the lines are at rest wavelength .",
    "this red - shift is observed both in cttss and intermediate objects ( it can not be measured in wttss because of the lack of h@xmath14 emission ) . thus , unless the p(14 )  3 - 10 h@xmath14 transition , that it is blended with the he  ii line , is unusually strong , it must be concluded that the narrow emission component of the heii line is red - shifted in most sources .",
    "note however , that the blending with the broad component could produce an apparent redshift if this broad component is asymmetric .",
