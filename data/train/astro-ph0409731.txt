    "it has been suggested that lorentz invariance ( li ) may be only an approximate symmetry of nature @xcite .",
    "although no true quantum theory of gravity exists , it was independently proposed that li might be violated in such a theory with astrophysical consequences @xcite .",
    "a simple formulation for breaking li by a small first order perturbation in the electromagnetic lagrangian which leads to a renormalizable treatment has been given by coleman and glashow @xcite .",
    "using this formalism , these authors point out that with li violation ( liv ) , different particles can have maximum attainable velocities ( mavs ) which can be different from @xmath0 . using the formalism of ref .",
    ", we denote maximum attainable velocity ( mav ) of a particle of type @xmath1 ( not necessarily equal to @xmath2 ) by @xmath3 .",
    "we futher define the difference @xmath4 and specifically here @xmath5 .",
    "these definitions will be used to discuss the physics implications of cosmic ray and cosmic @xmath6-ray observations@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    if @xmath7 , the decay of a photon into an electron - positron pair is kinematically allowed for photons with energies exceeding @xmath8 .",
    "this decay would take place rapidly , so that photons with energies exceeding @xmath9 could not be observed either in the laboratory or as cosmic rays . since photons have been observed with energies @xmath10 50  tev from the crab nebula @xcite , this implies that @xmath11tev , or that @xmath12 .    if , on the other hand , @xmath13 , electrons become superluminal if their energies exceed @xmath14 .",
    "electrons traveling faster than light will emit light at all frequencies by a process of ` vacuum erenkov radiation . '",
    "the electrons then would rapidly lose energy until they become subluminal . because electrons have been seen in the cosmic radiation with energies up to @xmath152  tev@xcite",
    ", it follows that @xmath16 . a smaller , but more indirect , upper limit on @xmath17 for the @xmath13 case can be obtained from theoretical considerations of @xmath6-ray emission from the crab nebula .",
    "its emission above 0.1 gev , extending into the tev range , is thought to be compton emission of the same relativistic electrons which produce its synchrotron radiation at lower energies@xcite .",
    "the compton component , extends to 50 tev and thus implies the existence of electrons having energies at least this great in order to produce 50 tev photons , even in the extreme klein - nishina limit .",
    "this indirect argument , based on the reasonable assumption that the 50 tev @xmath6-rays are from compton interactions , leads to a smaller upper limit on @xmath17 , _ viz . , _ @xmath18 .",
    "a further constraint on @xmath17 for @xmath13 follows from a change in the threshold energy for the pair production process @xmath19 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the square of the four - momentum is changed to give the threshold condition    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the energy of the low energy photon and @xmath22 is the angle between the two photons .",
    "the second term on the left - hand - side comes from the fact that @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that the condition for a significant increase in the energy threshold for pair production is @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 , or equivalently , @xmath27 .   the @xmath6-ray spectrum of the active galaxy mkn 501 while flaring extended to @xmath28 tev @xcite and exhibited the high energy absorption expected from @xmath6-ray annihilation by extragalactic pair - production interactions with extragalactic infrared photons@xcite , @xcite .",
    "this has led stecker and glashow @xcite to point out that the mkn 501 spectrum presents evidence for pair - production with no indication of lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) up to a photon energy of @xmath1520  tev and to thereby place a quantitative constraint on liv given by @xmath29 .",
    "this constraint on positive @xmath17 is more secure than the smaller , but indirect , limit given above .",
    "liv has been proposed consequence of quantum gravity physics at the planck scale @xmath30 gev , @xcite , @xcite . in models involving large extra dimensions ,",
    "the energy scale at which gravity becomes strong can occur at a scale , @xmath31 , even approaching a tev @xcite . in the most commonly considered case ,",
    "the usual relativistic dispersion relations between energy and momentum of the photon and the electron are modified@xcite , @xcite by a term of order @xmath32 .. ]    generalizing the liv parameter @xmath17 to an energy dependent form    @xmath33    the threshold condition from pair production implies @xmath34 since pair production occurs for energies of at least 20 tev , we find a constraint on the quantum gravity scale@xcite @xmath35 .",
    "this constraint contradicts the predictions of some proposed quantum gravity models involving large extra dimensions and smaller effective planck masses . in a variant model of ref .",
    ", the photon dispersion relation is changed , but not that of the electrons . in this case , we find the even stronger constraint @xmath36 .",
    "within the context of a more general cubic modification of the dispersion relations , jacobson , _ et al._@xcite obtained an indirect limit on @xmath37 from the apparent cutoff in the synchrotron component of the in the crab nebula @xmath6-ray emission at @xmath38 gev .",
    "however , their very strong constraint , @xmath37@xmath39@xmath40 , is qualified by considerations of electron helicity and photon polarization@xcite and is thus not as general as the constraint from photon - photon pair - production . also , for the model suggested in",
    ", this constraint does not hold .",
    "coleman and glashow @xcite have shown that for interactions of protons with cbr photons of energy @xmath21 and temperature @xmath41 , pion production is kinematically forbidden and thus _ photomeson interactions are turned off _ if    @xmath42    thus , given even a very small amount of liv , photomeson and pair - production interactions of uhecr with the cbr can be turned off .",
    "such a violation of lorentz invariance might be produced by planck scale effects@xcite , @xcite .",
    "if lorentz invariance violation is the explanation for the missing gzk effect , indicated in the _ agasa _ data , but not the _ hires _ data ( see fig .",
    "1)@xcite ) , one can also look for the absence of a `` pileup '' spectral feature and for the absence of photomeson neutrinos , but these may be more difficult to detect .",
