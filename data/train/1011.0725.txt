    "the sub - millimeter and millimeter emission of diffuse galactic dust is primarily determined by the thermal radiation of large dust grains that are in equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field ( dsert et al 1990 ) .",

    "while the dust sed models in the literature generally assume a fixed value for the spectral emissivity @xmath4 between 1.5 and 2.5 , there might be significant variations in @xmath4 , even in a small cirrus region , when taking into account the disordered structure of dust grains .",
    "there are also however the uncertainties associated with the dust size distribution and the silicate versus graphite fractions ; large variations in both these quantities could result in different equilibrium temperatures even in a small cirrus region .",

    "the procedure we use is the same as that of veneziani et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "a basic summary of the approach is that we fit , for example @xmath87 and @xmath88 , by drawing random pairs of @xmath4 and @xmath6 by sampling their likelihood functions from the mcmc chains we had first generated by fitting the isothermal sed models to individual pixel intensities ; here again , we restrict the analysis to chains where @xmath4 and @xmath6 are determined with relative errors better than 30% for both parameters .    by using the full mcmc chains to sample @xmath4 and @xmath6",

    "figure  4 demonstrates two interesting scientific results : ( i ) we find an underlying relation between @xmath6 and @xmath4 that can not be due to an anti - correlation induced by noise when fitting the sed form to pixel intensities and ( ii ) we find a higher value of @xmath4 at low dust temperatures compared to the values sugested by previous relations in the literature .",
    "our result shows that the anti - correlation also exists for low - intensity galactic cirrus and is not limited to high density clumps and molecular clouds that were previously studied .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath6 vs. @xmath4 relation captures different physical and chemical properties of the dust grains , including the size distribution and the interstellar radiation field that heat the dust .",
    "there is also a possibility that this anti - correlation results from line of sight projection of different dust temperature components ( shetty et al . 2009b ) . with the field at a galactic latitude of 30 degrees ,",
    "such overlap is likely to be small , but perhaps not completely negligible .",
    "unfortunately we do not have a way to constrain the line - of - sight projection due to the lack of distance information .",
    "also , studies on the @xmath4 and @xmath6 relation are so far limited to handful of fields and more work is clearly desirable .",

    "1998 ; boudet et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this has been explained as due to quantum physics effects on the amorphous grains , such as due to two - phonon processing and tunneling effects between ground states of multi - level systems .",
    "whether the relation we have observed is due to averaging different values of temperature along the line - of - sight or due to an intrinsic property of dust is something that will remain uncertain .",
    "related to the observation ( ii ) outlined above , the measurements we report here are primarily dominated by the diffuse cirrus emission over the whole sdp area .",
