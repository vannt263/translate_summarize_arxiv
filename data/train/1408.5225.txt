    "the problem of substorm onset has occupied the literature on solar - terrestrial physics for the past fifty years since akasofu [ 1964 ] , and the current understanding , as established by high - resolution ground and satellite optical observations [ donovan et al . , 2006 ;",
    "sakaguchi et al . , 2009 ;",
    "henderson , 2009 ] , is that the auroral arc initially deforms into a vortex street on the scale of 3070 km .",
    "it is clearly observed that the vortex street originates from a preexisting or newly produced arc that intensifies in @xmath1 min and expands poleward over the course of 2 to 3 min [ lyons et al . , 2002 ; mende et al . ,",
    "2009 ] .",
    "the vortex street has been interpreted in terms of instabilities in the plasma sheet , e.g. , shear flow and ballooning instabilities [ voronkov et al . , 1999 ] . however , this interpretation is only supported by the faint expectation that factors affecting strong magnetic or pressure fluctuations come from the external domain . on the other hand , multiple satellite observations [ ohtani et al . ,",
    "2002 ] have suggested that such a situation is not necessary , and there is an alternative means of arc intensification .",
    "a simple scenario seems to be that an arc lying on a local field line becomes destabilized through changes in the global conditions , leading to connection to magnetotail plasma instabilities [ c.f . , haerendel , 2010 ; henderson , 2009 ] .",
    "if the scenario is limited to one explaining only deformation of the arc and not its poleward expansion , it can be viewed as a nonlinear evolution of shear alfv@xmath0n waves in the magnetosphere - ionosphere ( mi ) coupling with non - uniform active field lines . a three - dimensional simulation of feedback instability in the system indicated that the waves induce strong magnetic and flow shears to produce vortex structures around the magnetic equator [ watanabe , 2010 ] .",
    "various linear eigenmodes from low - frequency field line resonances to high - frequency ionospheric alfv@xmath0n resonances have been shown to become destabilized in a dipole magnetic field [ hiraki and watanabe , 2011 ; hereafter , hw ] .",
    "these predictions are partially supported by evidence of the enhancement of the convection flow before substorm onset [ bristow and jensen , 2007 ] .    in this study",
    ", we performed three - dimensional simulations of shear alfv@xmath0n waves in a full field line system with mi coupling , including an east - west aligned arc .",
    "we report new results : i ) the initial arc splits and quickly deforms into a vortex street , ii ) there is a critical convection electric field for its growth , and iii ) the relationship is derived between the vortex size and the extent of intensification . unlike the previous studies on arc evolution starting from arbitrary setups [ lysak and song , 2008 ; streltsov et al . ,",
    "2012 ] , we solve equations describing the nonlinear evolution of the most unstable alfv@xmath0n eigenmode perturbations intrinsic in the full field line and show that arc deformation is a consequence of their growth . starting from the simplest analysis , we dropped processes related to sharp @xmath2 cavities , two fluid effects , and field - aligned electric fields .",
    "note that processes in the high-@xmath3 plasma sheet are beyond the range of an approach based on magnetic perturbations .",
    "in order to elucidate the physics involved in auroral structures , nonlinear evolution of shear alfv@xmath0n waves propagating along the dipole magnetic field @xmath4 can be modeled by using two - field reduced mhd equations [ e.g. , chmyrev et al . , 1988 ; lysak and song , 2008 ] .",
    "the waves slightly slip ( @xmath5 ) through the feedback coupling to density waves at the ionosphere .",
    "the system of interest is a field line of @xmath6 with a length of @xmath7 km and at a latitude of 70@xmath8 , where auroral arcs develop ; note that it corresponds to the lower latitude in the tail magnetic field geometry .",
    "the field line position @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 at the ionosphere and @xmath11 at the magnetic equator .",

    "suppose that the changes in the shape of the auroral arc are realized through changes in the variables ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and that @xmath36 and its electron acceleration are dropped .",
    "ionospheric plasma motion including density waves is described by the two fluid equations .",
    "considering the current dynamo layer ( height of 100150 km ) , we can assume that ions and electrons respectively yield the pedersen drift @xmath37 and the hall drift @xmath38 , with @xmath39 : mobilities and @xmath40 : molecular diffusion coefficient . by integrating the continuity equations over the dynamo layer ,",

    "let us first mention an overarching problem with regard to the application of our modeled system to the real world where auroral mechanisms , i.e. , field - aligned electron acceleration and the induced ionospheric density change , are at work from the first brightening of the onset arc .",
    "we suppose that these are generally important in the arc system but do not directly contribute to the arc deformation itself .",
    "the arc deformation could start from destabilization of the alfv@xmath0n waves , and field - aligned currents are amplified to be 420 @xmath126a / m@xmath77 in their nonlinear stage as shown in fig .",
    "the high current density can yield a strong field - aligned voltage if some resistivity as electron inertia and the realistic deep cavities are included in the system . as our first step by a minimal model setup without these features",
    ", we addressed the pure nonlinear coupling between an arbitrarily placed arc structure and alfv@xmath0n eigenmodes . at the next step",
    ", we will investigate the generation of field - aligned electric fields , the related electron acceleration and ionospheric source processes in our nonlinear mi feedback system .",
    "we would further provide two notes before analyzing our calculation results to compare with observations .",
    "the present study ignoring field - aligned potentials regards a pattern of vorticity @xmath34 as that of auroral arc .",
    "this treatment is supported by imager and radar simultaneous observations [ hosokawa et al . ,",
    "2013 ] , where the onset arc accompanies a counter - clockwise flow shear .",
    "it implies that the auroral arc strongly couples to the flow field ( or vorticity ) at the ionosphere @xmath10 . since the assumption was made that field - aligned currents are carried only by thermal electrons at @xmath10 , regions of the upward current @xmath164 at @xmath10 does not necessarily represent the auroral luminosity .",
    "the associated electrons only flow up magnetic fluxes but can not form the auroral luminosity .",
    "the next study should address on the relationship between @xmath34 , @xmath35 at @xmath10 , those at the region of high @xmath36 , and the related electron acceleration .",
    "the second note is on our initial setup of the auroral arc . although the system in the case of fig .",
    "2 is highly unstable with the imposed arc , the system under a weak convection electric field ( e.g. , @xmath91 mv / m ) is demonstrated to be stable as in fig .  5 and discussions below .",
    "destabilization of the arc along with feedback eigenmodes is not self - evident , and thus we consider our setup be natural .",
    "the scenario is that the arc appears long time ( 3060 min ) before substorm onset under a weak ( westward ) @xmath29 , and the source is at the magnetospheric end .",
    "after the poleward component of @xmath29 is enhanced up to a critical level ( see the next paragraph ) , the arc rapidly grows as shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "let us describe the changes in the wave growth patterns in the convection electric field of @xmath9140 mv / m ( fig .",
    "5 ) in the context of arc splitting .",
    "the behavior can be understood by the linear growth rate of feedback eigenmodes in fig .",
    "1 because they certainly grow in spite of oscillatory motion of @xmath158 through alfv@xmath0n wave propagation ( see also fig .  4 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that @xmath89 of the ( 2,0 ) mode switches from negative to positive at 2040 mv / m . on the other hand , @xmath89 of the ( 1,5 ) mode increases by @xmath165 times in this range , but decreases in the higher regime ; as these tendencies are inconsistent with the above growth pattern , this mode is not considered to be the main trigger .",
    "@xmath89 of the ( 1,2 ) mode monotonously increases , which affects its saturation level as shown below , but it is not directly related to the change .",
    "consequently , we can infer that the vortex street grows just after the arc splits to generate the ( 2,0 ) mode .",
    "alfv@xmath0n wave amplification follows the growth of the mode and leads to a cumulative growth of the ( 2,0 ) and ( 1,5 ) modes , forming into the vortex street .",
    "the critical field @xmath160 for the southward modes ( @xmath166 , or the ( 2,0 ) mode in this case ) is @xmath167 mv / m .",
    "an increase in @xmath158 in the case of @xmath91 mv / m ( fig .",
    "5 ) means that eastward modes ( @xmath168 ) can grow , though it takes long time ( @xmath169 min ) , after a couple of arc splittings ; remember the mode is defined in the westward moving frame of @xmath112 . however , these modes are decoupled from the southward modes during this growth , which is not consistent with observation of the arc changing into the vortex street [ e.g. , sakaguchi et al . , 2009 ] .",
    "we conclude that this case is a product of certain ideal conditions , and the critical field for vortex formation is the value given in the previous paragraph .",
    "let us see to what extent the vortex street can brighten .",
    "figure 6 shows the results for the feedback mode @xmath94 and @xmath122 mv / m . as in the case of @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the initial arc repeatedly splits until @xmath170 , brightens , and deforms into a twin vortex after that . note that in every case of ( 1,2 ) with @xmath171 mv / m , the saturation level of @xmath158 shifts to a higher value , up to @xmath172 from @xmath73 , than the level of the ( 1,5 ) cases .",
    "this behavior is not expected from the linear growth rates , i.e. , @xmath173 at @xmath174 mv / m , depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "we could claim that the ( 1,2 ) mode is well - suited for nonlinear coupling to the ( 2,0 ) mode . what can be inferred from this result",
    "is that the extent of arc intensification related to vortices is controlled by the growing eastward feedback eigenmodes .",
    "the modes were mainly determined by conductances @xmath175 and @xmath176 along with @xmath29 .     at the ionosphere @xmath10 for @xmath157 , 40 , 60 , and 80",
    "mv / m in the case of @xmath94 ; black lines are those shown in fig .",
    "lower : vorticity @xmath177 at @xmath178 for @xmath122 mv / m . ]",
    "let us compare our results with the observed features of arcs during substorm onset .",
    "ground - based optical observations have indicated that the arcs often flap and split just before vortex street formation [ e.g. , motoba et al .",
    ", 2012 ; private comm .  with k.  hosokawa and k.  sakaguchi ] .",
    "these behaviors imply that ionospheric currents and density waves are increased by their feedback coupling to alfv@xmath0nic @xmath35 .",
    "the vortex sizes produced by a feedback growth of the ( 1,5 ) and ( 1,2 ) modes are @xmath179 km and 35 km , respectively .",
    "we should notice that our simulation domain is a dipole field line ( @xmath6 ) , when the vortex sizes are compared to those seen in the onset arc as 4080 km [ sakaguchi et al .",
    ", 2009 ; and references therein ]",
    ". the field line length @xmath149 can be extended if an actual magnetotail field line is considered .",
    "then , @xmath180 is also extended , and the above difference ( factors of 23 ) between the vortex size in our model results and that in observations is not up to date the matter for explaining the behavior of the onset arc .",
    "another point is on the dynamic range of optical ( all - sky camera ) observations . in case of the above paper , power spectra in scales of @xmath181 km",
    "are noisy , and further the scale estimation strongly depends on the zenith angle of arcs .",
    "we urge high resolution measurements of the onset arc to estimate its real wavelength ; multi - point stereo observations are anticipated .",
    "the next point is on the magnitude of @xmath29 .",
    "the critical field @xmath182 mv / m ( i.e. , a flow of 0.43 km / s ) we present here fairly agrees with the enhanced convection flows ( @xmath183 km / s ) observed before onset [ bristow and jensen , 2007 ] .",
    "further comparison provides a useful restriction for interpreting statistical data , as well as the direction of @xmath29 assumed to be poleward in this paper .",
    "we urge that detailed measurements of pre - conditioning of onset arcs should be undertaken in the future .",
    "moreover , there is another problem related to the growth time scale .",
    "the scale of the observations , @xmath1842 min [ e.g. , mende et al . ,",
    "2009 ] is shorter than that of our calculation , @xmath1855 min .",
    "the alfv@xmath0n transit time we use is as large as @xmath186 s , but the growth time was shown to be shorter in more realistic cases ( @xmath187 s ) with ionospheric @xmath2 cavities [ hw , 2012 ] .",
    "therefore , simulations in the cases can explain the small @xmath188 in the observations .",
    "the results in this paper indicate that feedback modes are prevented from growing by the initial arc when @xmath189 , but they grow together into a vortex street when @xmath190 .",
    "the vortex street is a manifestation of the nonlinear evolution of alfv@xmath0n waves in the mi coupling system .",
    "the problems remaining to be solved are i ) how are waves trapped in the ionospheric cavity region to form a field - aligned electric field when the field - aligned current is amplified",
    "? and ii ) why does the active arc expand poleward in the next step ?",
    "the second question is closely related to coupling with magnetotail high-@xmath3 plasma dynamics [ e.g. , henderson , 2009 ] .",
    "by performing three - dimensional nonlinear mhd simulations including alfv@xmath0n eigenmode perturbations most unstable to the ionospheric feedback effects , we reproduced the auroral vortex street that often appears just before substorm onset .",
    "we found that i ) the initial arc splits , intensifies , and deforms into a vortex street within @xmath191 min , ii ) growth pattern changes at a convection electric field of @xmath192 mv / m , and iii ) the extent of arc intensification is controlled by the nonlinear behavior of feedback eigenmodes with @xmath193 .",
    "the results of our simulation indicate that the vortex street is a consequence of coupling between the shear alfv@xmath0n waves carrying field - aligned currents and the ionospheric density waves driven by the pedersen / hall currents .",

    "<S> by performing three - dimensional nonlinear mhd simulations including alfv@xmath0n eigenmode perturbations most unstable to the ionospheric feedback effects , we reproduced the auroral vortex street that often appears just before substorm onset . </S>",
    "<S> we found that an initially placed arc splits , intensifies , and rapidly deforms into a vortex street . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that there is a critical convection electric field for growth of the alfv@xmath0n eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex street is shown to be a consequence of coupling between the magnetospheric alfv@xmath0n waves carrying field - aligned currents and the ionospheric density waves driven by pedersen / hall currents . </S>"
