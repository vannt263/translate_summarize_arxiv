    "the resistivity is an important subject in condensed - matter physics .",
    "it has been studied experimentally and theoretically already with old classical physics . however , only from the fifties , with notions borrowed from microscopic modern physics that the resistivity has been viewed as a consequence of microscopic mechanisms which govern physical behaviors of materials through which conduction electrons travel . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the resistivity caused by magnetic scattering of itinerant electronic spins by localized lattice spins in magnetic materials ( ferromagnets and anfiferromagnets ) .",
    "the resulting resistivity is called hereafter `` spin resistivity '' which is to be distinguished from the resistivity due to spin - independent scattering , for example by phonons and non magnetic impurities .",
    "the spin resistivity , @xmath0 , was shown to depend on the spin - spin correlation in ferromagnetic crystals by de gennes and friedel@xcite , fisher and langer@xcite among others . at low temperatures ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the spin - waves are shown to be responsible for the @xmath2 behavior of the spin resistivity in ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "note however that in these calculations the itinerant electrons have been considered as free electrons interacting with the lattice spins , but there is no interaction between them .",
    "we have showed@xcite that when an interaction between itinerant electrons is introduced , the itinerant electrons can be crystallized at low @xmath1 giving rise to an increase of @xmath0 as @xmath3 .",
    "experimental data in various materials show this behavior@xcite , but we would warn that there may be other mechanisms involved as well . at the magnetic phase transition temperature @xmath4 ,",
    "the spin - spin correlation diverges in magnetic materials with a second - order phase transition .",
    "the theory of de gennes - friedel predicts that @xmath0 should show a divergent peak .",
    "however , experiments in various magnetic materials ranging from semiconductors to superconductors@xcite show indeed an anomaly at the transition temperature @xmath4 , but the peak is more or less rounded , not as sharp as expected from the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "it has been shown in fact that@xcite the form of the peak depends on the length of the correlation included in the calculation of @xmath0 : if only short - range correlations are taken into account , then the peak is very rounded .",
    "a justification for the use of only short - range correlations comes from the fact that the mean free path of itinerant spins is finite at @xmath4 .",
    "when scattering is due to impurities , the peak has been shown to depend on the localization length@xcite . in the case of antiferromagnets ,",
    "haas has shown the absence of a resistivity peak@xcite .",
    "our recent works using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have shown that there is indeed an anomaly at @xmath4 in various magnetic models from ferromagnets@xcite , antiferromagnets@xcite to frustrated spin systems@xcite .",
    "the shape of the anomaly depends on many ingredients such as crystal structures , spin models , and interaction parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we will show new results obtained by mc simulation when we take into account the temperature dependence of the relaxation time of localized lattice spins in the simulation .",
    "we will show that this temperature dependence affects the shape of the peak in the phase transition region .",
    "section [ model ] is devoted to a description of the general model and the mc method .",
    "we introduce in this section the temperature dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "results are shown and discussed in section [ res ] for both ferro- and antiferromagnets in terms of critical slowing - down .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "the model we use in our mc simulation is very general .",
    "the itinerant spins move in a crystal whose lattice sites are occupied by localized spins .",
    "the itinerant spins are assumed to be of ising type , but the method of simulation can be used for other spin models@xcite .",
    "the localized spins may be of ising , xy or heisenberg models .",
    "their interaction is usually limited to nearest neighbors ( nn ) but this assumption is not necessary .",
    "it can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "we consider a thin film of a given lattice structure where each lattice site is occupied by a spin .",
    "the interaction between the lattice spins is limited to nn with the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an ising spin whose values are @xmath7 , @xmath8 the exchange integral between the nn spin pair @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath10 for all nn spin pairs , for simplicity . as a convention , ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) interaction has positive ( negative ) sign .",
    "the system size is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of lattice cells in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are used in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions while the surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath16 axis are free .",
    "the film thickness is @xmath17 .",
    "we define the interaction between the itinerant spins and the localized lattice spins as follows @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ising spin of the @xmath20 itinerant electron and @xmath21 denotes the interaction that depends on the distance between an electron @xmath13 and the spin @xmath22 at the lattice site @xmath23 . for simplicity , we use the following interaction expression @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants . in the same way , interaction between itinerant electrons is defined by @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the interaction that depends on the distance between electrons @xmath13 and @xmath23 .",
    "the choice of the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be discussed below .",
    "dynamics of itinerant electrons is ensured by an electric field applied along the @xmath14 axis .",
    "electrons travel in the @xmath14 direction , leave the system at the end .",
    "the pbc on the @xmath32 planes ensure that the electrons who leave the system at one end are to be reinserted at the other end . for the @xmath16 direction",
    ", we use the mirror reflection at the two surfaces .",
    "these boundary conditions are used in order to conserve the average density of itinerant electrons .",
    "one has @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the charge of electron , @xmath35 the applied electric field and @xmath36 the displacement vector of an electron .",
    "since the interaction between itinerant electron spins is attractive , we need to add a chemical potential in order to avoid a possible agglomeration of electrons into some points in the crystal and to ensure a homogeneous spatial distribution of electrons during the simulation .",
    "the chemical potential term is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the concentration of itinerant spins in the sphere of @xmath39 radius , centered at @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is a constant parameter appropriately chosen .",
    "+      the procedure of our simulation can be split into two steps .",
    "the first step consists in equilibrating the lattice at a given temperature @xmath1 without itinerant electrons .",
    "when equilibrium is reached , in the second step , we randomly add @xmath42 polarized itinerant spins into the lattice .",
    "each itinerant electron interacts with lattice spins in a sphere of radius @xmath43 centered at its position , and with other itinerant electrons in a sphere of radius @xmath39 .",
    "the procedure of spin dynamics is described as follows . after injecting @xmath42 itinerant electrons in the equilibrated lattice , we equilibrate the itinerant spins using the following updating .",
    "we calculate the energy @xmath44 of an itinerant electron taking into account all interactions described above .",
    "then we perform a trial move of length @xmath45 taken in an arbitrary direction with random modulus in the interval @xmath46 $ ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( nn distance ) , @xmath49 being the lattice constant . note that the move is rejected if the electron falls in a sphere of radius @xmath50 centered at a lattice spin or at another itinerant electron .",
    "this excluded space emulates the pauli exclusion .",
    "we calculate the new energy @xmath51 and use the metropolis algorithm to accept or reject the electron displacement .",
    "we choose another itinerant electron and begin again this procedure .",
    "when all itinerant electrons are considered , we say that we have made a mc sweeping , or one mc step / spin .",
    "we have to repeat a large number of mc steps / spin to reach a stationary transport regime .",
    "we then perform the averaging to determine physical properties such as magnetic resistivity , electron velocity , energy etc . as functions of temperature .",
    "we emphasize here that in order to have sufficient statistical averages on microscopic states of both the lattice spins and the itinerant spins , we use the following procedure : after averaging the resistivity over @xmath52 steps for `` each '' lattice spin configuration , we thermalize again the lattice with @xmath53 steps in order to take another disconnected lattice configuration .",
    "then we take back the averaging of the resistivity for @xmath52 steps for the new lattice configuration . .",
    "we repeat this cycle for @xmath54 times , usually several hundreds of thousands times .",
    "the total mc steps for averaging is about @xmath55 steps per spin in our simulations .",
    "this procedure reduces strongly thermal fluctuations observed in our previous work@xcite .",
    "of course , the larger @xmath52 and @xmath54 are the better the statistics becomes .",
    "the question is what is the correct value of @xmath52 for averaging with each lattice spin configuration at a given @xmath1 ?",
    "this question is important because this is related to the relaxation time @xmath56of the lattice spins compared to that of the itinerant spins , @xmath57 .",
    "the two extreme cases are i ) @xmath58 , one should take @xmath59 , namely the lattice spin configuration should change with each move of itinerant spins ii ) @xmath60 , in this case , itinerant spins can travel in the same lattice configuration for many times during the averaging .    in order to choose a right value of @xmath52",
    ", we consider the following temperature dependence of @xmath56 in non frustrated spin systems .",
    "the relaxation time is expressed in this case as@xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant , @xmath63 the correlation critical exponent , and @xmath16 the dynamic exponent . from this expression , we see that as @xmath1 tends to @xmath4 , @xmath56 diverges . in the critical region around @xmath4",
    "the system encounters thus the so - called `` critical slowing down '' : the spin relaxation is extremely long due to the divergence of the spin - spin correlation . in our previous papers@xcite , we did not take into account the temperature dependence of @xmath56 .",
    "we propose to study here the spin resistivity using eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) .",
    "we define spin resistivity @xmath64 as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of itinerant electron spins crossing a unit slice perpendicular to the @xmath14 direction per unit of time .",
    "the spin resistivity is dominated by the two interactions eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) and ( [ k ] ) .",
    "as said earlier , our model is very general .",
    "several kinds of materials such as metals , semiconductors , insulating magnetic materials etc . can be studied with our model , provided an appropriate choice of the parameters .",
    "for example , non magnetic metals correspond to @xmath67 ( free conduction electrons ) .",
    "the case of magnetic semiconductors corresponds to the choice of parameters @xmath30 and @xmath26 so as the energy of an itinerant electron due to the interaction @xmath68 should be much lower than that due to @xmath69 , namely itinerant electrons are more tightly bound to localized atoms .",
    "note that @xmath70 depends on the concentration of itinerant spins : for example the dilute case yields a small @xmath70",
    ". we will show below results obtained for typical values of parameters which correspond more or less to semiconductors .",
    "the choice of the parameters has been made after numerous test runs .",
    "we describe the principal requirements which guide the choice : i ) we choose the interaction between lattice spins as unity , i. e. @xmath71 , ii ) we choose interaction between an itinerant and its surrounding lattice spins so as its energy @xmath72 in the low @xmath1 region is the same order of magnitude with that between lattice spins .",
    "to simplify , we take @xmath73 .",
    "this case corresponds more or less to a semiconductor , as said earlier , iii ) interaction between itinerant spins is chosen so that this contribution to the itinerant spin energy is smaller than @xmath72 in order to highlight the effect of the lattice ordering on the spin current . to simplify",
    ", we take @xmath74 , iv ) the choice of @xmath41 is made in such a way to avoid the formation of clusters of itinerant spins ( agglomeration ) due to their attractive interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) ] , v ) the electric field is chosen not so strong in order to avoid its dominant effect that would mask the effects of thermal fluctuations and of the magnetic ordering , vi ) the density of the itinerant spins is chosen in a way that the contribution of interactions between themselves is much weaker than @xmath72 , as said above in the case of semiconductors .    a variation of each parameter respecting the above requirements does not change qualitatively the results shown below . only the variation of @xmath43 in some antiferromagnets does change the results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the energy is measured in the unit of @xmath75 .",
    "the temperature is expressed in the unit of @xmath76 .",
    "the distance ( @xmath43 and @xmath39 ) is in the unit of @xmath49 .",
    "in this section , we show for comparison the results obtained with and without temperature dependence of the lattice relaxation time for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets . in each case",
    "we use the same set of interaction parameters in order to outline the effect of the temperature - dependent relaxation time .",
    "in this paper we use the lattice size @xmath77 and @xmath78 and we consider the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice for illustration . the lattice constant is @xmath49 .",
    "the spin resistivity is calculated with @xmath79 itinerant spins ( one electron per two lattice cells ) . except otherwise stated ,",
    "we choose interactions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "a discussion on the effect of a variation of each of these parameters is given above .",
    "note that , due to the form of the interaction given by eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) , the itinerant spins have a tendency to form compact clusters to gain energy .",
    "this tendency is neutralized by the concentration gradient term , i. e. a chemical potential , given by eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath41 has to be chosen so as to avoid an agglomeration of itinerant spins .",
    "this choice depends of course on the values of @xmath43 and @xmath39 .",
    "examples have been shown elsewhere.@xcite for the temperature dependence of the lattice relaxation time @xmath56 , we take @xmath88 ( 3d ising universality ) and @xmath89.@xcite by choosing @xmath90 , we fix @xmath91 at @xmath92 deep inside the paramagnetic phase far above @xmath4 .",
    "this value is what we expect for thermal fluctuations in the disordered phase .",
    "figure [ rx - f ] shows the spin resistivity @xmath0 in a bcc ferromagnet .",
    "note that the transition temperature for this thin film of size @xmath93 with ising spins interacting via the nn coupling is @xmath94 .",
    "several remarks are in order :    \\i ) the results obtained with and without temperature - dependent relaxation time for @xmath95 coincide with each other    \\ii ) at @xmath4 , for the set of parameters used here , the results using the temperature - independent relaxation shows a broad maximum above @xmath4 while those using the temperature - dependent relaxation strongly decreases at @xmath4 giving rise to a sharp peak .",
    "we show now in fig .",
    "[ rx - af ] the spin resistivity @xmath0 in a bcc antiferromagnet .",
    "note that the transition temperature is the same as that of the ferromagnet counterpart shown above . here",
    "we observe that @xmath0 in the case of temperature - dependent relaxation is lower than that in the case of temperature - independent one in the whole temperature range .",
    "note that the value of the peak is much smaller here than in the ferromagnet case .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ rx - f - af ] the two curves of ferromagnet and antiferromagnet with @xmath1-dependent relaxation time .",
    "we observe here that below @xmath4 , the resistivity of antiferromagnet is higher than that of ferromagnet , while for @xmath96 the reverse is true .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the relaxation time @xmath57 of the itinerant spins .",
    "we define @xmath57 in the simulations as the mc time ( in unit of one mc step / spin ) between two `` mc collisions '' , namely the lapse of time between two `` rejections '' of a spin to advance .",
    "of course this quantity is averaged over all itinerant spins and over the simulation time .",
    "figure [ rxt - f ] shows @xmath97 obtained by simulation using @xmath56 . as for",
    "@xmath0 seen above , the temperature dependence and independence are markedly different only for @xmath98 . the same thing",
    "is observed for the case of antiferromagnet shown in fig .",
    "[ rxt - af ]    figure [ rxt - f - af ] shows @xmath97 for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic cases , for comparison .",
    "the antiferromagnet has @xmath97 larger at @xmath95 .",
    "note that the resistivity is proportional to @xmath97 .",
    "let us discuss the reason why the temperature dependence of the lattice relaxation time affects so strongly the shape of the spin resistivity for @xmath99 .",
    "first , we emphasize on two `` empirical '' rules that we observed and verified in a number of cases :    * \\a ) itinerant spins move easily when they are energetically unstable .",
    "the electric field then drives them easily forward . on the other hand ,",
    "when they are `` at ease '' with surrounding spins , namely their energy is low , they will not move easily .",
    "we have checked this rule by calculating their velocity as a function of their energy@xcite * \\b ) in the case where the energy of an itinerant is low , the move of itinerant spins depends on the energy difference between its initial and final positions .",
    "consider the ordered phase of the lattice : the energy at any point is very low and the energy difference between any two points is close to zero ( ordered state ) .",
    "so , by the mc updating criterion , the electric field dominates again the move of itinerant spins .",
    "this explains the very small resistivity at low @xmath1 with respect to that at high @xmath1 ( except when @xmath100 where other mechanisms come to play ) .",
    "for the effect of @xmath56 , several important points are in order :    \\i ) for @xmath101 the lattice is ordered , therefore itinerant spins do not see the difference when the lattice changes its microstates more frequently or less frequently .",
    "this explains the same values obtained for @xmath0 with and without temperature dependence of @xmath56 in ferromagnets . in antiferromagnets",
    ", one observes a small difference due to the presence of lattice down spins which act differently on up - polarized itinerant spins .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath102 , the lattice is disordered : the lattice spins are frequently flipped .",
    "itinerant spins have to move constantly to accommodate themselves to the fluctuating environment .",
    "thus , @xmath57 is long by definition because there are very few rejections to move .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is small in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "\\iii ) finally , it is striking to observe a strong correlation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 : since @xmath56 is very large in the transition region where the lattice is in the regime of critical slowing down , itinerant spins have time to find themselves in energetically favorable positions .",
    "once they are there they refuse to move ( first rule mentioned above ) .",
    "as a consequence @xmath57 is very small ( for example @xmath103 if they refuse to move at every update trial ) . @xmath0 is thus very high .",
    "we have showed the inverse of @xmath57 in figs .",
    "[ rxt - f ] , [ rxt - af ] and [ rxt - f - af ] because @xmath0 is inversely proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is thus `` high @xmath56 corresponds to low @xmath57 '' and vice - versa .",
    "now , let us show the effect of the choice of @xmath62 of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) in fig .",
    "[ r2taul ] .",
    "the higher @xmath62 ( i. e. higher @xmath56 ) induces an increase of @xmath0 near @xmath4 but gives the same value as @xmath1 is far away from the critical point .",
    "thus , the width of @xmath0 at the transition temperature can serve as a measure of the relaxation time of the lattice spins .",
    "in this paper , we have shown the effect of the temperature dependence of the relaxation time on the spin resistivity for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic films with bcc lattice structure .    in the ferromagnetic case ,",
    "the long relaxation time in the critical region compared to that of the paramagnetic phase gives rise to a sharp peak of the spin resistivity at @xmath4 .",
    "the resistivity in the low-@xmath1 region is insensitive to the relaxation time while in high-@xmath1 region , the resistivity is much smaller than that obtained with the temperature - independent relaxation time .",
    "the same tendency is observed for the antiferromagnetic case : while the spin resistivity in the case of temperature - independent relaxation time does not show a peak at @xmath4 , the extremely long relaxation in the critical region with respect to that of the paramagnetic phase gives rise to a pronounced rounded peak at @xmath4 .",
    "it is very interesting to study other systems such as spin glasses where the relaxation time is extremely long even at temperatures far below @xmath4 .",
