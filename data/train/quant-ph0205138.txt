    "is lost , which leads to performance degradation .",
    "single - user detectors were overtaxed and shown rather poor performance even in multi - path environment @xcite . to overcome this problem , recent years multiuser detection ( mud )",

    "many authors proposed sub - optimal linear and nonlinear solutions such as decorrelating detector , mmse ( minimum mean square error ) detector , multistage detector , hoppfield neural network or stochastic hoppfield neural network @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "one can find a comparison of the performance of the above mentioned algorithms in @xcite .",
    "nonlinear sub - optimal solutions provide quite good performance , however , only asymptotically .",
    "quantum computation based algorithms seem to be able to fill this long - felt gap . beside the classical description , which we recently use ,",
    "researchers in the early @xmath0 century raised the idea of quantum theory , which nowadays becomes remarkable in coding theory , information theory and for signal processing @xcite .",
    "nowadays , every scientist applies classical computation , using sequential computers .",
    "taking into account that moore s law can not be held for the next ten years because silicon chip transistors reach atomic scale , therefore new technology is required .",

    "an information bearing bit is encoded by means of a user specific code with length of the processing gain ( _ pg_)@xcite . in case of uplink communication",
    "we assume perfect power control . in the receiver side",
    "it is not required synchronization between input signals and user specific codes , however we make our decision on symbols . applying bpsk modulation , the output signal of the @xmath2 user , denoted by @xmath6 , is given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energy associated to the @xmath2 and the user continuous signature waveform , respectively @xmath10 @xmath11 denotes the time duration of one chip , @xmath12 is the @xmath13 chip of the code word of subscriber @xmath14 and @xmath15 refers to the chip elementary waveform .",
    "we investigate a one path uplink wideband cdma propagation channel .",
    "the channel distortion for the @xmath2 user is modelled by a simple impulse response function @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the path gain and the delay of the @xmath2 user , respectively @xcite .",
    "they are assumed to be constant during a symbol period of @xmath19 .",
    "this model contains almost all elements of a typical wcdma channel except multipath propagation , which was omitted to simplify the explanation of the new quantum computation based multiuser detection scheme .",
    "however , based on the results of the present paper , multipath propagation can be included into the channel model on a very simple way .",
    "the received signal is the sum of arriving signals plus a gaussian noise component and thus can be written as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of users using the same band , @xmath22 is a white gaussian noise with constant @xmath23 spectral density .",
    "unfortunately , the search for the globally optimal mud @xcite usually proves to be rather tiresome , which prevents real time detection ( its complexity by exhaustive search is @xmath24@xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore , our objective is to develop new , powerful detection technique , which paves the way toward real time mud even in highly loaded system .",
    "since classical multiuser detection schemes only try to minimize the probability of error in noisy and high interference environment , they , even also optimal solutions , can commit an error .",

    "compares the quantized received signal with the content of the database .",
    "this task can be done efficiently , employing the grover @xcite database search algorithm @xmath48 , which is proved to be optimal @xcite in @xmath49 steps , where @xmath38 denotes the length of the database .    the optimal number of iterations is depending on the initial angle @xmath50 between the initial state @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as the number of the identical entries @xmath53 in the database . in @xcite it was shown that the rotation of state @xmath51 to the desired state @xmath54 after @xmath55 evaluations of grover operator @xmath48 is @xmath56 whereas in @xcite it was proved that the optimal number of iterations @xmath57 is given as @xmath58 in case of @xmath59 or even it exists no multiple entries in the qregister the angle @xmath60 where the optimal number of evaluations is equal to @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in case of @xmath62 , the initial angle @xmath63 , which leads to only one evaluation .    in case of quantum detection , however , it is not required to know the exact position of the representative of the received signal in the qregister , only whether is it contained in the database or not . for this purpose ,",
    "the so called _ quantum counting _ based on quantum fourier transformation ( qft ) designed for phase estimation is well suited . in the following part of this section",
    "we introduce the buildup of the applied databases , qregisters .",
    "furthermore , we shortly discuss the quantum counting problem and our way to deal with quantum multiuser detection problem .",
    "let us assume we would like to detect the @xmath2 user s symbol , denoted by @xmath64 . to design a suitable multiuser detector",
    "all of the user specific code words @xmath65 have to be known at the base station , collected in a @xmath66 sized database @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "in addition we create a qregister @xmath28 , which contains all the possible received signal configurations @xmath68 without @xmath64 @xmath69 where @xmath68 are the computational base states .",
    "since every possible noise and delay states for a given transmitted bit is involved in the prepared register , it is superfluous to send any phase information , which allows non - coherent detection .",
    "the first @xmath70 qubits represent all the combination of the symbols transmitted by all the interferer , e.g. if the value of @xmath71 qubit in a given @xmath68 is equal to 1 , it shows that the user @xmath72 has been transmitted a symbol denoted by @xmath73 , otherwise if @xmath74 the qregister has an entry @xmath75 . for a proper utilization of the qregister the next two parts in @xmath68",
    "is reserved for all quantized state of the noise @xmath22 and the delay @xmath76 : @xmath77 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume to apply a linear quantization @xmath78 , where @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 refers to the quantization step .",
    "it is remarkable , if the _ probability density function _ ( pdf ) of the target quantity is known , such as by the gaussian noise , an adequate nonlinear quantization could be used , whereby most significant values can be sampled denser , which can decrease the number of required qbits for description of noise .",
    "the values of the delay @xmath76 can be generated in a straitforward manner , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 could be @xmath83 $ ] . with the above mentioned description the size of qregister @xmath28 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the round up operation to the next integer .",
    "we consider two independent qregisters @xmath86 and @xmath87 for every user @xmath14 according to sent information symbol @xmath88 or @xmath89 . from this point",
    "we just refer to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , however , the operations on each qregister can be done in the same manner .",
    "thus , @xmath92 are the databases as well as detection means to check whether the received signal can be found in the databases @xcite .      performing multiuser detection",
    "it is obvious not to look for a pattern in a database itself but to indicate whether or not a solution even exists , consequently , the number of solutions have to be summed up .",
    "this quantum counting algorithm can be accomplished with combining the grover quantum search algorithm mentioned in section [ sec : model ] , with the phase estimation based on the quantum fourier transformation @xcite .",
    "the quantum counting algorithm is able to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary operation @xmath47 , or in this case the grover iterations @xmath48 @xmath93 which is in a close connection with the demanded number of solutions @xmath53 on the search .",
    "in addition to the original grover circuit a new register @xmath94 of @xmath57 new qubits should be feed to the quantum counting algorithm , whose state is initialized to an equal superposition of all possible inputs by a hadamard gate , as in figure [ fig : counter ] .",
    "the vector @xmath51 , which contains all the possible signal states with equally distributed probability amplitudes , is build up in the same way .",
    "the original grover block @xmath95 becomes a controlled grover block , where the transformation ( a rotation with angle @xmath50 , such as in the original grover algorithm ) will be only evaluated if the control signal equals to one .",
    "the goal of quantum counting is to estimate @xmath96 to @xmath97 bits of accuracy , with probability of success @xmath98 .",
    "the state of the register @xmath94 after the controlled grover iterations is @xmath99 which is exactly the qft belonging to @xmath50 .",
    "hence , to estimate @xmath96 an inverse quantum fourier transformation is executed on ( [ eq:23 ] ) before the measurement . in case of @xmath100 after a measurement , the demanded pattern is contained in the qregister @xmath92 , and if it is equal to zero , it is not included in .",
    "the required number of qubits @xmath57 @xmath101 in @xmath94 , and hereby the required number of grover blocks @xmath95 can be calculated in function of desired accuracy @xmath102 of @xmath96 and the probability @xmath103 of false detection .",
    "this error @xmath103 is occurred if @xmath96 is not in form of @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "hence it can be regarded as the probability of false detection .",
    "the accuracy @xmath97 of @xmath96 can be given as @xmath106 fortunately , we are able the upperbound @xmath97 in ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) . from the accuracy point of view",
    "the worst case is occurred if @xmath107 , because the initial angle @xmath50 , yielding form ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) , is the smallest .",
    "hence , @xmath97 should be chosen as large as possible , which leads to @xmath108    therefore , we have a direct connection between the detection error probability and the required length of register @xmath94 .",
    "however , before the measurement an inverse discrete qft is done , which adds additional states beside @xmath28 with a given probability , if @xmath50 is not an integer power of two , that could lead to false detection in the receiver . hence , the expression @xmath109 @xcite in ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) is just a approximation . in general",
    ", @xmath110 is needed to represent @xmath50 more precisely , and thus to decrease the probability of false detection , but the accuracy of the estimated angle @xmath111 is @xmath102 in the future too .",
    "this means , that @xmath110 only influences the probability amplitudes , which leads to be enough measuring the first @xmath97 most significant bits !          to improve the proper error probability of detection , there are some possibilities .    1 .",
    "one should chose @xmath112 , where @xmath113 .",
    "unfortunately , except the trivial case , where @xmath114 , which means the desired state @xmath115 is not in the qregister , it happens very rarely .",
    "2 .   our goal is to distinguish the case @xmath114 from @xmath116 .",
    "it is known from the previous point , that the detection of @xmath114 is certain .",
    "consequently , if @xmath117 a false detection is occurred if and only if we decide for @xmath35 after the measurement . for a more precise estimation of the error probability @xmath118 , one should extend the size of the qregister instead of @xmath110 bits , with @xmath119 more bits .",
    "we will show that based on our results @xmath119 can be much smaller than @xmath110 at a given @xmath118 , where    @xmath120    where @xmath111 refers to the estimated phase .",
    "the second part of the right side in ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) is equal zero , because of the previous analysis .",
    "assuming an unknown _ a - priori _ probability ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) becomes simpler @xmath121    the state of the examined @xmath94 qregister before measurement is given as @xmath122=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^l}}\\sum_k\\sum_ie^{j2\\pi\\delta k}e^{-j2\\pi ki}{\\mbox{$|i\\rangle$}}= \\nonumber \\\\=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^l}}\\sum_k\\sum_ie^{j2\\pi k\\left(\\delta-\\frac{i}{2^l}\\right)}{\\mbox{$|i\\rangle$}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^l}}\\sum_i\\sum_ke^{j2\\pi k\\left(\\delta-\\frac{i}{2^l}\\right)}{\\mbox{$|i\\rangle$}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is a real number",
    ". furthermore , the probability amplitude of the state @xmath39 is @xmath124 which is a geometrical series @xcite @xmath125 the demanded probability of error can be described as the sum of over all probability amplitudes given in ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) @xmath126 form which the parameter @xmath119 is calculable at a given @xmath118 .",
    "while @xmath119 can not be expressed explicitly from ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) , hence , in case of adaptive receiver structure it would be very useful to give less complex way of determine @xmath119 .",
    "for this purpose an upper bound has to be given for ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) .",
    "it is considerable that with increasing the size of the qregister with @xmath119 new bits , the sum in ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) may also greater , however , due to more accurate representation of @xmath50 the probability amplitude belonging to the false vectors diminishes better and better .      for the numerator of ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) in @xcite",
    "was shown an unambiguous upper bound @xmath127 @xmath128 , which is simple the diagonal of unit circle @xmath129 .",
    "we show now , that under certain conditions a tighter bound can be given .",

    "the unit circle is divided into two regions , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where we should find @xmath134 @xmath135 respectively , whereby we mapped @xmath136 in the range @xmath137 $ ] , where @xmath136 strictly monoton . to get a proper upper bound the maximum of the two regions for a fixed @xmath96 @xmath138\\pi=\\left[\\left(2\\left|2^t\\delta - l\\right|\\right)\\mathrm { mod } 1\\right]\\pi.\\label{eq:4.7}\\ ] ] the case of , when @xmath139 in ( [ eq:4.7 ] ) , yields in @xmath140 , which can not come true , inasmuch as we sum up to @xmath141 , which is always less than @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the absolute value operator can be neglected .",
    "the opposite case , where @xmath143 in ( [ eq:4.7 ] ) the non - integer part becomes @xmath144 because of @xmath145 is an integer .",
    "these two considerations lead to @xmath130      also in @xcite was shown , that the denominator of ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) @xmath146 is always greater than @xmath147 in the range @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "[ thm2 ] employing the grover search algorithm in quantum counting the denominator of ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) becomes @xmath149 .",
    "for the proof , we should first evaluate @xmath150 , which is @xmath151 form ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) , where the maximal value of @xmath152 , resulting from employing the grover searching in the quantum counting algorithm , @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , it is obvious , that @xmath154 , which two considerations lead to @xmath155 for the complete examination , one should also look for the @xmath156 value , which yields in @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is very close to zero and the second part greater than zero except for @xmath159 , which is not realized almost surely . following the above mentioned ideas , @xmath160 .",
