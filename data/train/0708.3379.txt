    "the critical current at which a voltage appears along the length of a superconductor is one of the most important factors considered in applications of superconductivity @xcite .",

    "pinning , isolated type - ii superconducting thin - film strips subjected to perpendicular magnetic fields show magnetic hysteresis due to geometrical edge barriers @xcite .",
    "such strips have finite critical currents arising from the edge barriers @xcite .",
    "it also has been shown that the critical currents become larger when slits are fabricated near the edges of the strips @xcite ; the edge - barrier effects are enhanced because the slits increase the number of edges that can prevent flux penetration into the inner strips . although at subcritical applied fields and currents the magnetic response of two parallel strips in the meissner state is reversible @xcite , when the strips are connected at their ends and an applied magnetic field exceeds a certain value , magnetic flux penetrates irreversibly and the magnetic response becomes hysteretic as a consequence of the edge barriers @xcite . a detailed analysis of the effects of edge barriers upon the magnetization hysteresis in samples consisting of one , two , and three parallel strips connected at their ends has been presented in @xcite .",
    "to calculate the combined effects of geometrical barriers and bulk pinning is more difficult , but this has been accomplished for single strips in @xcite , and a theoretical analysis of the magnetic - field dependence of the critical current of an isolated superconducting strip due to both an edge barrier and uniform bulk pinning has been presented in @xcite . here",
    "we extend the above calculations to account for both geometrical edge barriers and bulk pinning in an infinite number of strips using the @xmath0-array method @xcite , by which the magnetic - field and current - density distributions for an array of parallel superconducting strips arranged periodically along the @xmath1 axis in the plane @xmath2 can be obtained analytically from the solutions for an isolated superconducting strip @xcite . in particular , we consider the case for which each strip in the array carries an equal amount of current in the presence of a perpendicular applied magnetic field .",
    "we then calculate the critical current @xmath3 of each strip accounting for both a geometrical edge barrier , which impedes the entry of vortices into the strip , and uniform bulk pinning , which impedes the motion of vortices across the strip .",
    "our calculation is relevant to a number of recent studies of the ac properties of striated coated - conductor tapes , i.e. , tapes that have been subdivided into parallel thin strips ( filaments ) separated by narrow gaps .",
    "ideally , to minimize ac losses in power engineering applications using multifilamentary conductors , the individual filaments should not only have small cross sections but also be twisted and transposed , such that the filaments are inductively equivalent , are decoupled from each other , and thus carry equal current @xcite . in practice , it is not possible to satisfy all these conditions , and compromises are generally accepted for practical reasons .",
    "carr and oberly @xcite have suggested that that the ac losses in tapes several millimeters wide could be reduced by first subdividing the tapes by striations and then twisting the tapes .",
    "analytical and experimental results pursuing this idea have been reported in @xcite .",
    "ashworth and grilli @xcite have recently proposed a variation of this approach , in which the tape is also subdivided into narrow parallel filaments , but instead of twisting the tape , the filaments are interrupted periodically by transverse cross - cuts bridged with normal metal .",
    "magnetic flux can enter at the cross - cuts , thereby decoupling the filaments and allowing equal currents to flow in each filament .",
    "the additional ohmic losses in the normal bridges are more than compensated by a huge reduction in the far more important ac coupling losses .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the dc properties of an infinite array of parallel superconducting strips , which can be regarded as an approximation to a striated coated - conductor tape of finite width .",
    "our paper focuses on the possibility that a geometrical edge barrier can increase the critical current of each strip above that due to bulk pinning alone , but it also should be possible to use our results in calculating the hysteretic ac losses of an array of parallel strips as in @xcite .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec.[x_arrays ] we review our complex - field approach and the @xmath0-array method . in sec .",

    "we assume that its self - field bulk - pinning critical current density is @xmath70 = 1 ma/@xmath352 ( 10@xmath353 a / m@xmath354 ) , such that the bulk - pinnng critical sheet - current density is @xmath355 a / m and the bulk - pinning critical current is @xmath356 a. we use ( [ is00 ] ) with @xmath357 , @xmath358 , and @xmath359 to estimate the zero - field surface - barrier critical current @xmath169 .",
    "we use the experimental results of @xcite as discussed in @xcite , from which we estimate that @xmath129 = 180 oe = 1.4 @xmath360 a / m and @xmath130 = 3.2 koe = 2.6 @xmath361 a / m at 77 k. we use the conservative estimate that @xmath362 , which yields @xmath169 = @xmath363 = 4.5 a. the corresponding scaling field @xmath364 which appears in the denominator of ( [ h ] ) and ( [ tildeh ] ) , becomes @xmath365 3.6 oe = 286 a / m . the corresponding value of the pinning parameter is @xmath366 ,",
    "for which we obtain from ( [ tbph0 ] ) and ( [ iciv00 ] ) that the self - field critical current @xmath3 at @xmath367 is very nearly equal to @xmath368 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 remains very nearly equal to to @xmath368 as the applied field increases .",
    "our solutions show that the vortex - free regions are very close to the edges at the critical current ( i.e. , @xmath153 and @xmath369 are nearly equal to @xmath53 ) , such that the geometrical - barrier enhancement of @xmath3 is negligible .",
    "next we suppose that the 5 mm strip is subdivided into 50 parallel strips , each of width @xmath37 = 98 @xmath351 m , separated by gaps of width 2 @xmath351 m , with period @xmath38 = 100 @xmath351 m . to approximate the behavior of the resulting striated conductor , we apply the above x - array results . using ( [ is00 ] ) with @xmath357 , @xmath358 , @xmath370 , and @xmath371 , we find that the zero - field surface - barrier critical current of one of the narrow strips is @xmath372 = 2.9 a. the corresponding bulk - pinning critical current is @xmath345 = 0.98 a , and the bulk - pinning parameter ( [ p ] ) is @xmath175 = 0.22 . since @xmath172 , the reduced critical",
    "current is @xmath290 , and the self - field critical current of one of the strips is @xmath373 = 2.9 a , determined by the geometrical barrier alone .",
    "since there are 50 such strips , the estimated total self - field critical current is 143 a. the corresponding engineering critical current density , taking the cross section to be 5 mm @xmath374 1 @xmath351 m ( ignoring the cross section of the substrate ) is @xmath375 a / m@xmath354 = 2.9 ma/@xmath352 , as opposed to the 1 ma / am@xmath354 critical current density for the unstriated strip .",
    "the reduced critical current @xmath286 vs @xmath132 for this case is similar to that shown in figure [ icvsh ] for @xmath175 = 0.2 .",
    "however , the scaling field for @xmath286 vs @xmath132 from ( [ hscale ] ) is small : @xmath376 = 5.7 oe = 450 a / m . to summarize , the x - array results using the above assumptions predict that the self - field critical current for the striated conductor can be significantly enhanced above that due to bulk - pinning alone ( by approximately a factor of three using the above numbers ) .",
    "however , the application of a relatively small perpendicular magnetic field ( of the order of tens of oe or hundreds of a / m using the above numbers ) can be expected to produce a strong reduction of the enhancement and to return the critical current nearly to that due to bulk - pinning alone .    throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed that the bulk - pinning critical current density @xmath70 is field - independent .",
    "we now justify this assumption as follows .",
    "we see from figure [ icvsh ] that the critical current has a significant dependence upon @xmath377 only when @xmath378 . in the above two paragraphs we found for state - of - the - art ybco coated conductors for which @xmath379 ma/@xmath352 ( 10@xmath353 a / m@xmath354 ) that @xmath380 oe = 796 a / m or @xmath381 10 g = 1 mt . experimentally it has been found , for example in @xcite , that @xmath70 at 77 k in strong - pinning ybco films is very nearly independent of field for @xmath382 100 oe @xmath383 8000 a / m or @xmath384 g = 10 mt .",
    "therefore it is an excellent approximation to assume that @xmath70 is field - independent over the range of applied fields for which the effects of geometrical barriers or edge pinning are relevant .    in @xcite",
    ", we argued that in state - of - the art unstriated ybco coated conductors the pinning is due almost entirely to bulk pinning and that geometrical barriers ( or edge pinning ) have a negligible effect upon the critical current .",
    "the above calculations indicate that for striated coated conductors the additional edges produced by the striations could produce significant enhancements of the critical current in self - field , but these enhancements are strongly suppressed by relatively small applied magnetic fields . in applications where the magnetic flux density is of the order of 0.1 t or higher , where @xmath70 has a strong field dependence , we expect that geometrical barriers will have no significant effect upon ybco coated conductors , even if they are striated .",
