    "the flrw models provide a remarkably precise description of cosmological observations , but to achieve this we need to pay a price  in order to obtain concordance with observations it must be assumed that the universe is filled with an unknown substance called dark energy . however , this substance has never been observed directly and , since it has very unusual properties , some have begun to ask whether dark energy is real or if it is the description of the universe which , requires the existence of such an exotic entity , that is invalid .    while it is possible that our universe is filled with dark energy ,",
    "many alternatives have been proposed : brane - world cosmologies ( see @xcite for a review ) , f(r ) cosmology ( see @xcite for a review ) , application of inhomogeneous cosmological models ( for a review see @xcite ) and others .",
    "one of the recently proposed approaches is based on an averaging framework .",
    "such an approach is motivated by the fact that the einstein equations are non - linear , which means that the solution of the einstein equations for a homogeneous matter distribution is different from the averaged solution to the einstein equations for a general matter distribution .",
    "in other words , the evolution of the homogeneous model might be slightly different from the evolution of an inhomogeneous universe , even though inhomogeneities in the universe , when averaged over a sufficiently large scale , might tend to be zero .",
    "the difference between the evolutions of homogeneous and inhomogeneous models of the universe is known as the backreaction effect . in this approach ,",
    "one considers a solution to the einstein equations for a general matter distribution and then an average of various observable quantities is taken . under certain assumptions",
    "such an attempt leads to the buchert equations @xcite .",
    "the buchert equations are very similar to the friedmann equations , except for the backreaction term , which is in general nonvanishing if inhomogeneities are present . for a review on the backreaction effect and the buchert averaging schemem",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "based on this scheme , larena et al .",
    "have recently proposed a model @xcite in which the metric of the universe at a given instant looks like the flrw metric , but the evolution of the scale factor is governed by the buchert equations . in this paper",
    "we aim to perform the bayesian analysis of the cosmological observations within the models proposed in @xcite .",
    "if the averaging procedure is applied to the einstein equations then for irrotational , pressureless matter and 3 + 1 adm space - time foliation with a constant lapse and a vanishing shift vector , the following equations are obtained @xcite    @xmath1    where a dot ( @xmath2 ) denotes @xmath3 , @xmath4 is an average of the spacial ricci scalar @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the scalar of expansion , @xmath7 is the shear scalar , @xmath8 is the matter density , and @xmath9 is the volume average over the hypersurface of constant time : @xmath10 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath11 is defined as a cube root of the volume :    @xmath12    where v@xmath13 is an initial volume .    equation ( [ bucherteq1 ] ) is compatible with ( [ bucherteq2 ] ) if the following integrability condition holds    @xmath14    similarly , as in the flrw models , the following parameters can be introduced :    @xmath15    the hamiltonian constraints can then be written as :    @xmath16    observe that @xmath17 can act like @xmath18 . moreover ,",
    "if the dispersion of the expansion is large then @xmath19 can be large and as seen from ( [ qdef ] ) , one can get acceleration ( @xmath20 ) without the need for dark energy .",
    "the template metric of the universe - the metric which describes the averaged universe can be written as    @xmath21    a similar approach , i.e. to consider the template metric with a scale factor which evolves accordingly to the buchert equations instead of the friedmann equations , was first introduced by paranjape and singh @xcite , though in their model @xmath22 was constant .",
    "the motivation for @xmath23 comes from the fact that the averaged spatial curvature , if calculated at one instant , does not have to be the same as the averaged spatial curvature calculated at another instant .",
    "this is closely related to the fitting problem closely studied by ellis and stoeger @xcite . in considering the fitting problem ,",
    "it becomes apparent that a homogeneous model fitted to inhomogeneous data can evolve quite differently from the real universe .",
    "therefore , if inhomogeneous model is averaged at one instant its flrw parameters may be different for the flrw parameters obtained after averaging at another instant .",
    "the buchert equations do not form a closed system . to close these equations and thus to calculate the evolution of the scale factor one has to introduce some further assumptions @xcite .",
    "one such assumption can be : @xmath24 @xcite . as seen from the integrability condition ( [ intcond ] )",
    ", this leads to    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "now , the final step is to derive a relation between the average spacial curvature @xmath27 and the curvature index @xmath22 . in analogy to the flrw models , the following relation can be proposed @xcite :    @xmath28    in sec .",
    "[ curidx ] we will modify the above assumption and test models with different relations between @xmath22 and @xmath27 . summarizing , the model considered in this paper is described by the metric ( [ thm ] ) , but the evolution of the scale factor is governed by the buchert equations . employing the assumptions ( [ ansatz1 ] ) and ( [ ansatz2 ] ) the evolution equations reduce to the following relation :    @xmath29    this model is parametrized by two parameters : @xmath30 and @xmath26 .",

    "they found that this model is in good agreement with observations . in the next section",
    "we will perform the bayesian analysis of this model using the type ia supernovae ( snia ) data , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "the model presented in the preceding section will be confronted with cosmological observations in the bayesian framework using the cosmonest code @xcite which was adapted to our case . in the bayes theory",
    "all that we know about the vector of parameters ( @xmath32 ) of a given model ( @xmath33 ) is contained in the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) , which is given by @xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 denotes the set of data used in the analysis ; @xmath36 is the likelihood function for a given model , which will henceforth be referred to as @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the prior pdf , which enables us to include our previous knowledge ( i.e. without information coming from the data @xmath35 ) about the parameters under consideration ; and the last quantity @xmath39 is the normalization constant , called the evidence ( or marginal likelihood ) , which is the most important quantity in the bayesian framework of model comparison .",
    "the posterior pdf could be simply summarized in terms of a best fit value , which could be the posterior pdf mode ( the most probable value of @xmath32 ) or the mean of the marginal posterior pdf of a given parameter ( @xmath40 ) , obtained by integration ( [ posterior ] ) over the remaining parameters .",

    "in addition to the geometric measurements described above , we study constraints obtained from the measured dilation scale of the bao in the redshift space power - spectrum of 46,748 luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . the dilation scale is defined as @xmath102^{1/3 } , \\label{dvdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the co - moving angular diameter distance and @xmath97 is the hubble parameter as afunction of redshift .",

    "it should be noted that the value of 1370 @xmath105 64 mpc was obtained within the framework of linear perturbations imposed on the homogeneous flrw background .",
    "instead , such an analysis should be carried out within the framework of the model considered in this paper .",
    "otherwise , we should be aware of possible systematical errors .",
    "when the geometry of the spacetime is not flrw the possible sources of errors are : ( 1 ) the sound horizon can be distorted and can be of a different size in parallel and perpendicular directions ; ( 2 ) the expansion rate can be different with respect to parallel and perpendicular directions ; ( 3 ) the redshift distortions , if analysed within the inhomogeneous model , might lead to estimates different from those received within the standard approach ; ( 4 ) another source of error comes from the fact that in their analysis eisenstein et al . converted the redshifts of lrg galaxies to distances assuming the @xmath106cdm model . despite these uncertainties we proceed with the analysis to see how the bao data can possibly constrain the data . as seen from fig .",

    "when we expand the allowed prior range for the parameter @xmath92 , the values of @xmath30 and @xmath26 are slightly shifted upwards , and the constraints on @xmath26 become weaker ( see also the posterior pdfs presented in figure [ fig5a ] and figure [ fig5b ] )",

    "the above results are encouraging and motivate further study of the backreaction models .",
    "especially , it is important to study assumptions other than ( [ ansatz1 ] ) and ( [ ansatz2 ] ) . as seen , if only assumption ( [ ansatz2 ] ) was modified ( models 2 - 4 ) then not only do we obtained a better fit , but also the value of @xmath30 realistically decreases compared to model 1 .",
    "in this paper we presented a bayesian analysis of the backreaction models .",
    "this work was motivated by the recently proposed model of the inhomogeneous alternative to dark energy @xcite . in this approach",
    "the universe is modeled by the buchert equations , which describe the relations between the scale factor , the average spatial curvature , the average matter distribution , the average expansion and the shear .",
    "larena et al .",
    "@xcite showed that their model is consistent with supernova and cmb data .",
    "here we included the bao data and tested this model within the bayesian approach ( our model 1 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the snls and cmb data alone strongly favour the @xmath106cdm model . with the union sample and bao data",
    "there is almost strong evidence ( @xmath113 ) to favour the @xmath106cdm model over our model 1 .",
    "however , if just the best - fit models are compared , then the @xmath114 ( union+cmb+bao ) for the @xmath106cdm and model 1 are @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "if the @xmath114 distribution is assumed , then for 307 degrees of freedom in model 1 the probability that this model is true in the light of data is 22.6% . in comparison ,",
    "the @xmath106cdm model ( 308 degrees of freedom ) gives 29.3% .",
    "therefore , we can see that the best - fit model 1 fits observations almost as well as the @xmath106cdm model .",
    "still , there are other concerns regarding this model .",
    "for example , can the assumptions ( [ ansatz1 ] ) and ( [ ansatz2 ] ) be justified ?",
    "in other words , how does the backreaction and the spatial curvature of the real universe evolve , and does the relation @xmath117 for the real universe hold ?",
    "the most concerning is the value of @xmath30 , which is quite large , @xmath118 .",
    "however , as it was shown in sec .",
    "[ curidx ] , after the assumption ( [ ansatz2 ] ) was modified , we were able to obtain a better fit and , in addition , the value of @xmath30 decreased to @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( or even lower if the bao data is excluded  see tables [ tab4 ] and [ tab5 ] ) for models 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "this shows that a lot still needs to be done in the context of the backreaction models , especially in the study of the relation between the average spatial curvature and the backreaction .",
    "we also investigated the sensitivity of the results to the prior assumptions on the @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath26 parameters .",
    "the most prominent changes are in the case in which the hubble parameter is fixed and in the case in which the range of the parameter @xmath92 is extended . in the latter case , the evidence against model 1 with respect to the @xmath106cdm model is weak .",
    "currently the @xmath106cdm model is preferred by the observational data , but it is possible that , after the revision of assumptions ( [ ansatz1 ] ) and ( [ ansatz2 ] ) we could obtain a more satisfactory results ( see table  [ tab3 ] and fig .",
    ". we should also remember that in these models of dark energy , the dark - energy - term appears as a consequence of inhomogeneities that are present in the universe .",
