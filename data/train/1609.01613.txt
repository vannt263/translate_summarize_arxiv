    "the spin pumping without net charge transport stems from the exchange of angular momentum between the itinerant spins in the metal and the collective magnetization dynamics in the adjacent ferromagnet .",
    "the dynamical generation of spin currents is of special relevance since alternative methods based on driving an electrical current through the interface are limited by the conductance mismatch.@xcite the spin pumping - induced currents have been detected as the long - ranged dynamic interaction between two ferromagnets separated by a normal metal@xcite or as a dc - voltage signal in bilayer systems.@xcite in the case of nonmagnetic metals with a strong spin - orbit coupling , the spin current through the interface may engender a charge current along the metallic layer as result of the inverse spin - hall effect.@xcite as the thickness of the metallic layer is reduced , additional interfacial effects must be considered . the different contributions may be identified by analyzing the symmetries of the voltage signal with respect to different adjustable parameters , such as the orientation of the saturated magnetization controlled by the applied static field.@xcite additionally , we can use propagating spin waves instead of fmr and vary the direction of propagation .    among other materials ,",

    ", we report the experimental observation of a chiral pumping effect in out - of - plane magnetized yig / slg bilayer and show that spin waves propagating in the yig film induce a sizable electric voltage in the adjacent slg .",
    "we study the symmetry of the observed phenomenon by reversing the static magnetic field and the direction of spin - wave propagation and find that the corresponding changes in the sign of the electric voltage clearly indicate a broken reflection symmetry about the plane normal to the interface .",
    "we associate this symmetry breaking with the presence of screw dislocations in the crystalline lattice of yig , which are expected to have a strong effect on the two - dimensional electron gas in slg .",
    "we present a theoretical model , which shows that such crystalline defects can result in a chiral pumping effect with the observed symmetry .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the conventional spin pumping - induced voltages obtained for in - plane magnetized films@xcite are rooted in the reflection symmetry breaking about the plane of the interface .",
    "they present different symmetries and are therefore unrelated to the signal reported here .",

    "graphene was placed on top of a monocrystalline yig film of 5.1 @xmath0 m thickness grown by means of liquid phase epitaxy on 0.5 mm thick gallium gadolinium garnet ( ggg ) substrate .",
    "the saturation magnetization of the yig film defining the saturation field in the out - of - plane geometry was @xmath1 kg . the slg sample was grown on a 50 @xmath0 m thick 99.99% pure copper foils in a cold - wall low - pressure cvd reactor ( black magic , aixtron ) . after the cu foil had been cleaned in acetone and then shortly etched in acetic acid to remove surface oxide , it was placed on a graphitic heater inside the reactor and annealed at 1000 @xmath2c during 5 min in a flow of 20 sccm h@xmath3 and 1000 sccm ar .",

    "a directional coupler was used to monitor the reflected mw power , allowing for the determination of the resonance absorption in the sample due to the excitation of the spin waves . by keeping @xmath20 constant and varying @xmath14 , we recorded @xmath21  curves characterizing the field - dependent excitation of spin waves in yig , see fig .",

    "the curves exhibit several maxima corresponding to the fmr , higher - order standing , as well as propagating spin waves in yig .    simultaneously with the microwave measurements , we recorded the dc - voltage between the electrodes . a lock - in technique",
    "was applied in order to detect the dc - voltage caused by the spin waves propagating in the yig film .",
    "microwaves were modulated by a square wave with the repetition frequency of 10 khz and the voltage difference between different leads was measured by the lock - in amplifier . during the measurements ,",
    "the static magnetic field was swept and the dc - voltage along with the reflected mw power signal as a function of @xmath14 were recorded .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows a typical dependence of @xmath22  the voltage between the electrodes a and b. comparing figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) , one sees that the dc - voltage in slg is induced at the same values of @xmath14 , where the efficient excitation of spin waves takes place .",
    "this clearly indicates its direct connection to the high - frequency magnetization precession in yig .",
    "the most striking feature of the observed phenomenon is its unusual symmetry with respect to the inversion of @xmath14 . as seen from fig .",
    "1(c ) , the detected voltage changes its sign if the orientation of @xmath14 ( and @xmath18 ) is reversed .",
    "we emphasize that this inversion is not accompanied by visible changes in the microwave absorption curve ( fig .",
    "further measurements show that the induced voltage is the same for both sides of the sample , @xmath23 .",
    "it is proportional to the intensity of the spin wave ( the absorbed microwave power ) and changes sign if the direction of the spin - wave propagation is reversed .    to obtain better insight into the underlying physics ,",
    "we consider the symmetry of the phenomenon in more detail . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the induced electric field @xmath24 is oriented in the sample plane parallel to the direction of the spin - wave propagation indicated in fig . 2 by a vector @xmath25 , whereas the magnetization / magnetic field is perpendicular to the sample plane .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 signs indicate the polarity of the measured dc - voltage at a given orientation of the magnetization . as seen in fig .",
    "2 , rotation by 180@xmath2 around the normal to the film plane reverses both the direction of the spin - wave propagation and that of the electric field , whereas the direction of the magnetization stays unchanged , all in agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "however , mirroring of the system with respect to the vertical plane parallel to the direction of the spin - wave propagation ( @xmath28 ) does not change neither the direction of the spin - wave propagation nor that of the electric field , since they are real vectors , whereas the magnetization , which is an axial vector , is reversed .",
    "we emphasize that this contradicts to the experiment ( see fig",
    ". 1 c ) ) .",
    "in other words , the phenomenon responsible for the appearance of the voltage in the yig / slg bilayer requires that the inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "more specifically , the observed effect would be forbidden if the clockwise and counter - clockwise directions in the sample plane were equivalent , which reveals its chiral nature .    to check whether the observed",
    "non - equivalence is a characteristic feature of the yig film itself , we performed high - precision fmr measurements on yig films of small lateral dimensions ( 5.1 @xmath0 m thick circle with the 0.5 mm radius and 6 @xmath0 m thick @xmath29 mm@xmath30 square ) without slg . in these experiments ,",
    "the fmr in the yig sample was excited by a quasi - uniform dynamic magnetic field .",
    "the entire test device was mounted on a non - magnetic rotatable sample holder , which was placed in a static magnetic field with a homogeneity better than 0.1 oe , with the @xmath31-axis being the rotation axis of the holder .",
    "note here that the actual rotation axis ( the @xmath31-axis ) in the described experiments differs from the rotation axis of the thought experiment ( the @xmath32-axis ) shown in fig .",
    "the sample holder was designed to keep the position of the sample constant with an accuracy of 0.2 mm over the entire rotation . by sweeping the microwave frequency at a fixed magnetic field ,",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath33 was measured as a function of the frequency .",
    "then , the holder with the sample was rotated by 180@xmath2 , and the measurements were repeated .",
    "the results of the measurements for the two orientations of the sample were averaged over several measurement cycles .",
    "the obtained fmr curves for the directions of the static magnetic field parallel @xmath34 and antiparallel @xmath35 to the normal to the film surface demonstrating a clear frequency difference of @xmath36 mhz are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is significantly larger compared to the estimated uncertainty of 0.5 mhz originating from the inhomogeneity of the static field and the stray fields of the sample holder .",
    "the measurements were repeated for different values of the applied magnetic field resulting in the field dependence of @xmath37 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( b ) .",
    "one clearly sees that @xmath37 systematically increases as @xmath14 approaches @xmath1 kg .",
    "qualitatively similar results were obtained for different samples except that the maximum values @xmath37 were found to vary from 6 to 13 mhz .",
    "the results presented in fig . 3 show that the frequency of the fmr in yig films depends on whether the static magnetic field is parallel or antiparallel to the normal to the film surface @xmath38 , i.e. it depends on the direction ( clockwise or counter - clockwise with respect to @xmath38 ) of the magnetization precession .",
    "this indicates that the inversion symmetry is broken , since the clockwise and the counter - clockwise directions in the plane of the film are not equivalent .",
    "although the microscopic origin of this breaking is not yet fully clear , it should be connected with the defects in the crystallographic structure of yig , since the ideal high - symmetry cubic structure of yig is definitely incompatible with this symmetry breaking .",
    "it is known that the dominating defects in high - quality epitaxial yig films are growth dislocations .",
    "their typical lateral density of about 10@xmath39 @xmath40 is connected with the typical misfit between yig and ggg lattices of @xmath41 ( refs .  ) .",
    "it is also known that such dislocations strongly influence the magnetic dynamics in yig.@xcite possible mechanisms of the defect - mediated symmetry breaking can include a growth - induced misbalance between clockwise and counter - clockwise screw dislocations and effects similar to the antisymmetric surface dzyaloshinskii - moriya - like interactions@xcite in combination with a dislocation .",
    "we emphasize that , although the symmetry breaking is present in yig films without slg on top , its influence on the magnetization dynamics is very small and can only be detected in high - precision measurements .",
    "this is not surprising , since the symmetry breaking appears to be a surface phenomenon , which has vanishing influence on the magnetization in the bulk of the film . on the contrary",

    "next , we provide a phenomenological model for the observed effect based on the existence of a finite density of screw dislocations in yig . the voltage signal is related with the electromotive forces induced by the magnetization dynamics .",
    "a screw dislocation creates a distortion of the graphene lattice as shown in fig .",

    "we emphasize that this mechanism must be taken as a suggestive explanation for the observed phenomenon since there is no direct observation of the proposed mechanical deformations .",
    "we assume that the exchange interaction couples the spins of itinerant electrons of slg to the localized magnetic moments in yig .",
    "the hamiltonian reads as@xmath42 the first term is the dirac hamiltonian describing electronic states with momentum @xmath43 around the two inequivalent valleys @xmath44 in graphene , where @xmath45 is a vector of pauli matrices associated to the sub - lattice degree of freedom of the wave function and @xmath46 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the second term corresponds to the exchange coupling , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are the itinerant spin operators and @xmath49 is a unit vector along the local magnetization in yig .",
    "the last term is a spin - lattice interaction that couples the mechanical degrees of freedom with the spins of electrons .",
    "as it is well known,@xcite graphene can support large mechanical distortions that change dramatically the dynamics of dirac electrons .",
    "when an slg is placed on top of disturbed yig , the carbon atoms near a screw dislocation can be expected to follow its distorted profile , which introduces a torsion in the honeycomb lattice , as represented in fig .",

    "@xmath52 represents the displacements of the carbon atoms  that parameterizes the torsion of the graphene lattice and can on average be related to the density of screw dislocations .",
    "the form of this coupling is dictated by the c@xmath53 symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , and its microscopic origin resides in the hybridization of @xmath54 and @xmath55 orbitals of carbon atoms , which enhances the spin - orbit effects within the low - energy bands.@xcite note here that the proposed deformation just models the observed symmetry breaking to provide a proof of principle for the chiral pumping effect .",
    "we expect our model to be qualitatively correct regardless of the actual deformations of the lattice close to dislocations .",
    "the effective exchange field seen by itinerant electrons , @xmath56 , is tilted away from the local magnetization following the torsion of the lattice , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the electromotive force in the adiabatic limit , which is rooted in the associated geometrical berry phase , respects the structural symmetries of the device .",
    "indeed , the correction due to the magnetization tilting expressed in eq .   averages to @xmath67 when integrated upon the period of the spin wave excitation .",
    "the introduction of screw dislocations in yig breaks the structural symmetries of the transport signals in slg owing only to non - adiabatic corrections to the electromotive force .",

    "the contribution in eq .   should saturate when the theory crosses over to the strongly non - adiabatic regime , at frequencies of the order of @xmath77 .",
    "we expect for the electromotive force to be suppressed at larger frequencies due to a dynamic averaging effect , similarly to the motional narrowing in the spin diffusion problem : the magnetization precession is so fast that its time - dependent component effectively averages out from the view of electron spins .      .",

    "the model predicts that the effect should exist only within a certain range of spin - wave frequencies around @xmath77 .",
    "although @xmath47 can not be directly measured in the experiment , the theoretical prediction can be verified by analyzing the frequency dependence of the observed effect .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the dependences of the voltage on @xmath79 proportional to the intensity of the excited spin waves , recorded for different spin - wave frequencies . as seen from fig .",
    "5(a ) , the voltage is linearly proportional to the spin - wave intensity and the proportionality coefficient @xmath78 is indeed strongly frequency dependent .",
    "moreover , in agreement with the theoretical results , the frequency dependence of @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) clearly exhibits a resonance - like behavior with the maximum at about 6 ghz .",
    "the relatively small exchange constant @xmath80 ev obtained from the observed resonant frequency nicely agrees with the recently determined exchange field of 0.2 t.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we experimentally observe a chiral charge pumping in yig / slg bilayers caused by the symmetry breaking at the yig surface .",
    "the effect provides a novel , efficient mechanism for detection of magnetization dynamics for spintronic and magnonic applications .",
    "the developed theoretical model , taking into account the exchange interaction between localized magnetic moments in yig and itinerant spins in graphene , predicts that the strength of the effect can be increased by making use of two - dimensional conductors with a strong spin - orbital coupling , such as mos@xmath3.@xcite additionally , the found symmetry breaking can result in other , not yet observed , effects .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that a sizable chiral charge pumping can be achieved at room temperature in graphene / yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) bilayer systems . </S>",
    "<S> the effect , which can not be attributed to the ordinary spin pumping , reveals itself in the creation of a dc electric field / voltage in graphene as a response to the dynamic magnetic excitations ( spin waves ) in an adjacent out - of - plane magnetized yig film . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the induced voltage changes its sign when the orientation of the static magnetization is reversed , clearly indicating the broken spatial inversion symmetry in the studied system . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of effect shows a non - monotonous dependence on the spin - wave frequency , in agreement with the proposed theoretical model . </S>"
