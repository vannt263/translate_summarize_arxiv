    "poisson s ratio is a material constant defined as the negative of the ratio between the transverse and longitudinal strains in the direction of an applied load .",
    "our daily experiences frequently tell us that when a material is compressed in a given direction , it will expand in the direction perpendicular to the applied load : materials conforming to this ubiquitous behavior are characterized by positive values of their poisson s ratio . in contrast , and perhaps against our common intuition , there exist examples of both man - made and naturally occurring materials that contract ( expand ) in the direction perpendicular to an applied compressive ( tensile ) load .",
    "such materials are characterised by a negative poisson s ratio and are often referred to as auxetic materials .    since the first description of a material exhibiting a negative poisson s ratio @xcite ,",
    "numerous examples and applications have been reported : natural layered ceramics @xcite , fabric reinforcement@xcite , and low - stiffness auxetic yarns and fabrics @xcite among many others .",
    "the surprising behavior of auxetic materials continues to challenge our intuition and did the same to many influential physicists , for instance , in 1964 richard feynman noted that `` it is reasonable that [ poission s ratio ] should be generally positive , but it is not quite clear that it _ must _ be so '' @xcite .",
    "however , recent advancements in the field of auxetic metamaterials have presented fresh new looks into material sciences , structural design , and soft condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "it is often the case that auxetic properties of a material are a result of interplay between a structure s internal geometry and the constituent material properties .",
    "such structures , where one or more mechanical property is dependent on the geometry of the sample s substructure ( rather than purely the material composition ) , fall into the class of mechanical metamaterials @xcite .",
    "examples of the exploitation of the internal geometry s ability to achieve novel global mechanical properties include pentamode metamaterials @xcite , mechanical cloaks for flexural waves @xcite , seismic metamaterials @xcite as well as auxetic mechanical metamaterials @xcite .",
    "recent work centering on a square 2-dimensional lattice of circular holes has shown that through close control of internal geometry , elastic instability can be utilised as a route to uni - directional , planar , and auxetic behaviour @xcite .",
    "this example is of particular interest because it provides a systematic way to tune macroscopic mechanical responses through a wide range of poisson s ratios and stiffnesses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the auxetic nature of the structure is `` switched on '' above a critical strain ; before this strain the material has a positive poisson s ratio and this allows for further tailorability in the material s mechanical response @xcite . in this 2-dimensional lattice ,",
    "uniaxial compressive loads induce a short wavelength elastic deformation mode : the lattice structure undergoes a high degree of reorganization as alternating mutually orthogonal ellipses are formed in place of the circular voids and the structure collapses .",
    "hence , the reconfiguration results in an auxetic response of the lattice . this elastic instability and the consequent breaking of internal lattice symmetry",
    "is shown in figure [ frames]-(a ) .",
    "it is noted that a square lattice made up of homogenous slender beams may also , in theory , present a similar buckling mode where the lattice deforms with a short wavelength mode , as depicted in figure [ frames]-(d ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated however , that the short wavelength mode is never preferred because the stresses required for the onset of this instability are always higher than the stresses that trigger the long wavelength modes depicted in figure [ frames]-(c ) @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider a square lattice made of component beams described by two of their thicknesses : the central section of the beam has thickness @xmath0 , while the end sections of the beam have thickness @xmath1 , part of a lattice made up of these elements is shown in figure [ frames]-(b ) .",
    "we find that through manipulation of the beam thickness and the length of the central section considered , the short wavelength deformation mode can be accessed at a lower critical load than the long wavelength mode .",
    "in contrast to methods based on bloch - wave analysis @xcite , we present an analytical model for this finite sized lattice , including boundary effects , and show good agreement between our model and finite element simulations . this approach to calculating the buckling load of the lattice gives us an efficient method for the exploration of the design space .",
    "we capture a non - trivial region of parameter space that would yield metamaterials with auxetic properties for loading greater than that required to trigger elastic instability . within this region of design space , we also calculate the critical load that would be required to switch the properties of the material from positive to negative poisson s ratio .",
    "furthermore , by considering a lattice with different beam properties in the elements parallel and perpendicular to the direction of applied loading , we explore the possibility of creating samples which have direction - dependent failure modes : that is , when loaded in one direction , the material will fail with short wavelength failure and thus would be described by a negative poisson s ratio ; however , when loaded in a direction perpendicular to this , the sample would exhibit long wavelength failure and thus no auxetic properties .",
    "we now lay out the organisation of this article . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the necessary elements that describe the lattice s unit cell for our model example .",
    "our approach is based on the classical euler - bernoulli beam , which has been modified to incorporate non - uniform elastic beams . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the general methodology , namely the transfer matrix approach .",
    "this method allows us to describe the in - plane deflection of elastic beams in the most general way possible by taking into consideration a series of attached linear and torsional springs as well as thickness variation .",
    "we analytically express the transfer matrices for these three forms of discontinuities , unify this treatment in order to describe the general transfer matrix across the finite direction of the lattice , and deal with the boundary conditions of the system . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how symmetry analysis makes the homogenisation of the unit cell to the lattice structure possible and discuss how the linear and torsional springs are determined from the reaction forces and moments that the lattice inflict on a localised unit cell . in section 5 ,",
    "we present our results which are comprised of good agreement between the finite element method ( fem ) and our semi - analytic calculations . in section 6 ,",
    "we summarize our main results and provide the reader with our view of the broad impact of our method .",
    "let us consider a 2-dimensional lattice of height @xmath2 which is infinite in the horizontal spatial dimension . through assuming certain symmetry relationships between one vertical element of length @xmath2 and its neighbours , we are able to establish the behaviour of the whole lattice through the analysis of one beam element .",
    "the influence of the lattice on the beam we here consider is encapsulated in a distribution of elastic support provided to the beam itself  this is shown schematically in figure ( [ lattice_schematic ] ) where much of the notation used in this paper is introduced .",
    "the strength of this elastic support is dependent on symmetry relations that we shall consider in the following sections .",
    "the approach in this work adopts and expands the transfer matrix formulation of previous work @xcite , where such matrices were used to calculate the optimal placement of linear springs along a euler - bernoulli beam .",
    "the basis for this model is the classical euler - bernoulli beam equation @xcite . here , we consider the general situation where the slender beam under consideration may have a varying cross - section , or thickness , causing its second moment of area @xmath3 to be a function of the lagrange coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the beam of length @xmath2 is subjected to a compressive force @xmath6 and external body loads acting perpendicular to the long axis of the beam @xmath7 .",
    "it can be shown that the beam s deflection from its initially straight configuration , @xmath8 obeys the following ode : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the young s modulus of the material .",
    "we shall consider two sources of elastic support : linear and torsional springs .",
    "the former enters the balance equation explicitly as , @xmath7 , and is written @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the stiffness of the elastic support .",
    "the latter form of elastic support , provided by torsional springs , accounts for the applied moments on the beam given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the stiffness of the field of torsional springs and @xmath15 describes the rotation of the beam at @xmath4 relative to its initial configuration .",
    "we adopt the small angle approximation , which reads @xmath16 .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce beam thickness discontinuities in a unit cell , where these are represented in eq .",
    "( [ e - beq ] ) by a specific choice of the functional form of @xmath17 .",
    "the explicit choice of @xmath17 to be considered here , for the transition between two regions of constant thickness as shown in figure [ lattice_schematic]-(a ) , is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the second moments of area for the sections of length @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and @xmath23 is the heaviside step function ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 ) .    as a matter of convenience , we define the following non - dimensional quantities : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "through considerations of symmetry , the buckling threshold calculations of the lattice will be reduced to that of a single vertical beam with a variable cross section and an appropriate set of linear and/or torsional springs placed along its length .",
    "these springs are used to represent the influence of the horizontal elements in the lattice on the vertical beam .",
    "the buckling of this single beam is analysed through a transfer matrix formulation .",
    "this approach is then used to infer the elastic properties of the lattice .",
    "the transfer matrices calculated here can be derived from considerations of the continuity / discontinuity of the solution to eq .",

    "* linear springs : * let us assume only point like spring supports . in general , each linear spring placed on the beam may be thought of as having independent stiffnesses .",

    "it is noted that antisymmetric modes always correspond to short wavelength buckling where @xmath93 is close to zero at the nodes , thus indicating a high energy cost in the stretching of the horizontal elements as compared to bending them .",

    "it is noted that the effects of the boundaries parallel to the direction of loading are relatively short ranged @xcite , thus we hypothesized that although the theory presented here is for lattices that are infinite in the horizontal direction ( see figure [ lattice_schematic ] ) , this dual response will be present for finite lattices as well .",
    "it is therefore likely that a square sample constructed with parameters taken from region ( b ) or ( c ) has auxetic properties when compressive load is applied parallel to one set of component beams , but it behaves as a material with positive poisson s ratio when a load is applied perpendicular to these beams .",

    "this has uncovered the possibility of direction - dependent auxetic structural properties : we have shown that there exist regions of parameter space in which a square lattice , subjected to compressive loads parallel to one set of beams , would behave as a material with positive poisson s ratio but when perpendicular to these beams , the structure may instead present an auxetic behaviour .",
    "the model can also be used to predict the tuning of the load of transition from positive to negative poisson s ratio .",
    "the critical loading could also be varied depending on its directionality with respect to the beams on the sample .",

    "<S> we present an analytical model to investigate the mechanics of 2-dimensional lattices composed of elastic beams of non - uniform cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on reducing a lattice to a single beam subject to the action of a set of linear and torsional springs , thus allowing the problem to be solved through a transfer matrix method . </S>",
    "<S> we show a non - trivial region of design space that yields materials with auxetic properties for strains greater than that required to trigger elastic instability . </S>",
    "<S> the critical loading required to make this transition from positive to negative poisson s ratio is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we present lattice parameters that provide direction - dependent deformation modes offering great tailorability of the mechanical properties of finite size lattices . not only is our analytical formulation in good agreement with the finite element simulation results , but it provides an insight into the role of the interplay between structure and elastic instability , and gives an efficient methodology to pursue questions of rational design in the field of mechanical metamaterials . </S>"
