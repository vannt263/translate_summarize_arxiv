    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnets in a field , for many years known to display antiferromagnetic and field  induced spin  flop phases .",
    "this interest is due to various reasons , among others , ( i ) to clarify the phase diagram of the prototypical xxz model , especially for the square lattice @xcite , ( ii ) to study multicritical , like bi and tetracritical , behavior @xcite , and ( iii ) to elucidate ground states as well as thermal properties of low  dimensional quantum magnets exhibiting , possibly , supersolid magnetic ( i.e. non  collinear biconical @xcite ) structures @xcite .",
    "of course , rather recent pertinent experiments also should be mentioned @xcite .",
    "as a starting point of theoretical studies on uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnets , one often considers the xxz model , with the hamiltonian    @xmath0    \\ ; - \\ ; h \\sum\\limits_{i } s_i^z\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the exchange coupling between spins being located on neighboring lattice sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the exchange anisotropy , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the applied magnetic field along the easy axis , the @xmath7axis . the model has been found to display in the ( temperature t , field h)plane antiferromagnetic ( af ) and spin  flop ( sf ) phases on square and simple cubic lattices . in two dimensions , the transition between the two phases had been argued to be of first order in case of the spin1/2 quantum case @xcite . in contrast , in the classical case ( with spin vectors of length one ) there appears to be a narrow disordered phase in between the two ordered phases .",
    "the three phases seem to meet at zero temperature in a hidden tetracritical point @xcite at the critical field @xmath8 .",
    "that point is a highly degenerate ground state , where also biconical ( bc ) spin configurations are stable @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic , biconical , and spin  flop classical spin configurations are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for the xxz model on the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the phase diagram has been believed to show the same topology as in the mean  field approximation , with a direct transition of first order between the af and sf phases , ending in a bicritical point at which the two critical phase boundary lines between the paramagnetic ( p ) phase and the af as well as the sf phases meet with the af - sf transition line @xcite .",
    "recently , this scenario has been scrutinized using renormalization group methods @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of our study is to shed light upon this issue , applying extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "spin orientations on neighboring sites showing antferromagnetic ( a ) , biconical ( b ) , and spin  flop ( c ) ground state structures in the xxz model . ]",
    "the phase diagram obtained from our simulations , analyzing systems with up to @xmath9 spins in runs of , at least , @xmath10 monte carlo steps per spin , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . indeed ,",
    "setting @xmath11 , we can locate the triple point of the af - p , sf - p , and af - sp boundary lines accurately , at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , differing quite substantially from the old estimate based on appreciably shorter simulations @xcite .",
    "phase diagram of the xxz antiferromagnet , with @xmath11 .",
    "inset : vicinity of the triple point . ]",
    "moreover , studying the transitions in the vicinity of that triple point , we do not observe deviations from the previously anticipated bicritical scenario @xcite , with the af - p boundary line belonging to the ising , and the sf - p boundary line belonging to the xy universality class .",
    "we identify the universality classes from determining critical exponents , e.g. , of the ( staggered ) longitudinal and tranverse susceptibilities , and from determining the critical binder cumulants of the af and sf order parameters @xcite .",
    "note that in a renormalization group calculation to high loop order , a different scenario had been put forward @xcite , favouring the existence of a tetracritical point or some kind of critical end point . in that scenario ,",
    "one expects either a stable bc phase near ( @xmath14 ) or at least one of the af - p and sf - p boundaries should become a line of transitions of first order near that point @xcite . in our simulations , we observe that biconical spin configurations show up close to the af - sf phase boundary at low temperatures , reflecting the , again , high degeneracy of the ground state at the critical field separating the af and sf structures .",
    "however , these configurations do not destroy , in contrast to the situation in two dimensions , the direct af - sf transition of first order @xcite . actually ,",
    "applying also renormalization group arguments , it has been suggested very recently that the type of the triple point may depend on the strength of the anisotropy , allowing for a bicritical point @xcite .",
    "perhaps , monte carlo studies on different values of the anisotropy may provide further insights .",
    "adding , especially , single ",
    "ion terms due to crystal  field anisotropies to the xxz model , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , bc spin configurations may be stabilized over a range of fields in the ground state .",
    "this behavior has been observed for quantum and classical spins on chains and square lattices for a quadratic single ",
    "ion term @xcite . here",
    "we shall add to @xmath15 a cubic anisotropy term of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath16\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 denotes the strength of the cubic anisotropy .",
    "the sign of @xmath17 determines whether the spins tend to align along the cubic axes , for @xmath18 , case 1 , or , for @xmath19 , case 2 , in the diagonal directions of the lattice . because of these tendencies , the bc , ( i.e. bc1 or bc2 ) , structures , as well as the sf structures , show no full rotational invariance in the @xmath20plane , in contrast to the xxz case discussed above .",
    "now , obviously , the discretized spin projections in the @xmath20plane favour four directions @xcite .    the resulting ground state phase diagram of the full hamiltonian , @xmath21 with fixed exchange anisotropy , @xmath22 , and varying cubic term , @xmath17 , may be determined numerically without difficulty , as depicted in fig .",
    "ground states of the full hamiltonian with exchange anisotropy , @xmath11 , and the cubic term . ]",
    "note that , for @xmath23 , the transitions to the bc1 structures are typically of first order , with a jump in the tilt angles , @xmath24 , with respect to the @xmath7-axis , see fig .",
    "1 , characterizing the bc configurations .",
    "however , in the reentrance region between the sf and bc1 structures at @xmath25 close to -1 , the change in the tilt angles seems to be smooth at the transitions @xcite .    obviously , at non - zero temperatures , several interesting scenarios leading , possibly , to multicritical behaviour , where af , sf , bc , and p phases meet , may exist .",
    "so far , we focussed attention on two cases : ( a ) positive cubic anisotropy @xmath19 , at constant field @xmath26 @xcite , see fig .",
    "3 . at small values of @xmath17",
    ", there is an af ordering at low temperatures . above a critical value , @xmath27 , the low ",
    "temperature phase is of bc2 type , followed by the af and p phases , when increasing the temperature .",
    "the transition between the af and p phases is found to belong to the ising universality class , while the transition between the bc2 and af phases seems to belong to the xy universality class , with the cubic term being then an irrelevant perturbation @xcite .",
    "( b ) negative @xmath17 , fixing the cubic term , @xmath28 , and varying the field , see fig .",
    "3 . in accordance with the ground state analysis ,",
    "we observe , at sufficiently low temperature , @xmath29 , af , sf , bc1 , and p phases , when increasing the field , as depicted in fig .",
    "interestingly , the bc1 phase seems to become unstable when raising the temperature , with the other phases being still present @xcite , see fig .",
    "5 . this may suggest that the three boundary lines between the bc1p , sf ",
    "bc1 , and sf ",
    "p phases meet at a multicritical point .",
    "of course , further clarification and a search for other , possibly multicritical scenarios at different strengths of the cubic term , @xmath17 , are desirable .",
    "staggered magnetizations versus field , at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the bc1 phase being squeezed out .",
    "systems with @xmath32 spins are simulated . ]",
    "staggered magnetizations versus field , at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the bc1 phase being squeezed out .",
    "systems with @xmath32 spins are simulated . ]    in summary , we have studied antiferromagnets with fixed exchange and varying cubic anisotropies in a field on the simple cubic lattice . in the case of the xxz model , the nature of the triple point and the thermal role of bc structures",
    "have been clarified . by adding the cubic anisotropy , discretized bc phases may be stabilized leading to interesting critical and multicritical phenomena .",
