    "the determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath2 from inclusive semileptonic @xmath6 decays requires theoretical predictions for partial decay rates , which are then compared to their experimentally measured values .",
    "because of a dominating @xmath7 background in a large portion of phase space , this procedure is adopted for a variety of restricted regions in phase space as obtained by , e.g. , accepting only events with one or more of the following features : charged - lepton energy @xmath8 , hadronic invariant mass @xmath9 , leptonic invariant mass @xmath10 , hadronic @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the energy and @xmath14 the three - momentum of the final hadronic state in the @xmath5-meson rest frame .",
    "for many of these cuts a hierarchy of energy scales exists in the decay process , for example @xmath15 , and shape - function effects become important @xcite .",
    "the theoretical expressions for differential decay rates in this region of phase space factorize into hard functions at the scale @xmath16 , and the convolution of jet functions and shape functions at the scale @xmath17 @xcite . while the jet functions are perturbatively calculable , shape functions are non - perturbative objects that capture all strong - interaction effects below the scale @xmath18 . at leading power the jet function @xmath19 and shape function @xmath20",
    "are universal , and enter the qcd - factorization theorems for both the triple differential decay rate in @xmath1 decays and in the @xmath0 normalized photon spectrum @xcite .",
    "one strategy for the inclusive determination of @xmath2 is to use the @xmath0 photon spectrum to extract the leading shape function @xmath20 , which then allows for the calculation of arbitrary semileptonic partial decay rates @xcite .",
    "it was shown in that reference that the factorization approach can be applied to all commonly used kinematic cuts . in practice",
    "this program is realized by adopting a parameterizable model for the shape function , and fitting the parameters using information of the measured photon spectrum .",
    "it was emphasized in @xcite that such a model is only acceptable if the values for parameters are stable when fitted to different aspects of the photon spectrum , such as moments of it , or its functional form ( provided that the resolution is coarse enough to smear out hadronic resonances ) . with improving data on the photon spectrum such an approach might require further and further refinement of the models used .",
    "a different strategy is to eliminate the necessity for the extraction of the leading shape function , and to use the experimental data directly .",
    "such ideas have been investigated previously in @xcite for some specific cuts , where partial rates in semileptonic decays are expressed as weighted integrals over the @xmath21 photon spectrum , @xmath22 in the most recent analysis of this type , @xcite , the cut was chosen as @xmath11 for simplicity , and the weight function @xmath23 was calculated at complete two - loop order at the intermediate scale @xmath18 . the second term on the right - hand side of this equation denotes a residual hadronic power correction ( rhc ) , which was absorbed into the weight function in that reference . in the above relation @xmath24 denotes the partial semileptonic decay rate and @xmath25 the normalized photon spectrum in radiative decays , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the photon energy in the @xmath5-meson rest frame , and the total decay rate @xmath28 is defined to include all events with @xmath29 .",
    "it is beneficial to use the normalized photon spectrum instead of the absolute spectrum , because the weight function as defined in ( [ eq : sffree ] ) is independent of @xmath30 , possesses a well - behaved perturbative expansion @xcite , and because the normalized photon spectrum can be determined with better accuracy than the absolute one @xcite . in order to determine @xmath2 from relation  ( [ eq : sffree ] ) both @xmath24 and the normalized photon spectrum enter as experimental input , while the weight function @xmath31 and the residual hadronic correction @xmath32 are theoretical quantities .    in this paper , we extend the technology developed in @xcite to derive the weight function for an _ arbitrary _ kinematic cut that includes events with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in general , the weight function @xmath31 ( and the correction @xmath32 ) , as well as the integration limit @xmath35 in ( [ eq : sffree ] ) depend on the particular cut that is used .",
    "for example , if we consider a cut on the charged - lepton energy @xmath36 then @xmath37 , or if a cut on hadronic invariant mass @xmath9 is considered then one needs @xmath38 .",
    "a quick way to obtain some intuition on how @xmath31 and @xmath35 depend on the specific cut qualitatively is to consider the @xmath1 phase - space depicted in figure  [ fig : pspace ] .",
    "note that @xmath39 in radiative decays , so that the phase - space of @xmath40 consists only of the vertical boundary on the right - hand side of the plot .",
    "this picture explains correctly how the maximal @xmath41 depends on the nature of the cut , and where to expect some kinks in @xmath31 , for example for a combined cut on @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in the next section",
    "we will derive an expression for the weight function at leading power , which follows from exact factorization theorems for differential rates in inclusive @xmath5 decays in the shape - function region .",
    "the formula for the weight function is thereby also valid to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we compute its explicit form to next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) at the intermediate scale @xmath18 and to next - to leading order ( nlo ) at the hard scale @xmath44 in renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory , including three - loop running effects . this approximation is sufficiently precise for phenomenological applications since effects at subleading power become as important as higher - order perturbative effects at leading power . in section  [ sec : powcorr ] we discuss first - order power corrections .",
    "kinematical power corrections enter the weight function , while hadronic power corrections give rise the quantity @xmath32 in ( [ eq : sffree ] ) .",
    "we then apply our results to a few examples of kinematic cuts in section  [ sec : examples ] and perform an analysis of theoretical uncertainties on @xmath2 by using a simple model for the experimental inputs .",
    "in this section we will adopt the leading - power approximation .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of relation  ( [ eq : sffree ] ) is then absent , because it collects contributions from subleading shape functions to both radiative and semileptonic decay rates , which start at order @xmath45 .",
    "we start the discussion by stating the exact factorization theorems for the fully differential leading - power decay rate in @xmath6 decays @xmath46 and for the normalized @xmath0 photon spectrum @xmath47 the superscript @xmath48 indicates that these equations are valid to leading power . in ( [ eq : xulnu ] ) @xmath49 denotes the hard function , which collects all matching corrections at the scale @xmath44 and depends on the kinematic variables @xmath50 for which the phase - space is @xmath51 .",
    "the jet function @xmath52 contains distributions that act on the shape function @xmath53 and depends on @xmath54 via @xmath55 . in formula  ( [ eq : xsgamma ] ) for the photon spectrum , on the other hand , the hard function is denoted by @xmath56 , and the argument of the jet function is @xmath57 , independent of @xmath54 because @xmath39 in radiative decays .",
    "three powers of the @xmath58-quark mass appear due to phase - space integrations in the total rate @xmath28 .",
    "renormalization - group ( rg ) running effects between the scales @xmath44 and @xmath18 build up the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the factorization formulas , which are such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "expressions for them will be given below .",
    "we start the derivation of the weight function by considering the factorized expression for an arbitrary partial differential decay rate @xmath64}dy    \\int\\limits_0^{\\e_{\\rm max}[p_+,y ] } d\\e \\ ;    \\frac{d^3 \\gamma_u^{(0)}}{dp_+ \\,dy \\,d\\e } \\;.\\ ] ] the integration limits @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ] , as well as @xmath35 depend on the specifics of the cut .",
    "( the use of squared brackets for these quantities is supposed to remind the reader that these functions are defined differently for different kinematic cuts . )",
    "we are now going to rewrite this semileptonic decay rate such that it resembles a weighted integral over the normalized photon spectrum .",
    "clearly the biggest obstacle is that the argument of the jet function @xmath19 in ( [ eq : xulnu ] ) depends on the kinematic variable @xmath54 , while it does not in ( [ eq : xsgamma ] ) .",
    "the solution to this problem has been presented in @xcite , where it was shownthe quantity considered in that reference was @xmath67 . ] that a factorization of the integrated jet function in the sense that @xmath68 can be achieved for arbitrary @xmath69 , if @xmath70 is allowed to be a distribution in the variable @xmath71 . here , @xmath72 we will discuss the nature of @xmath70 and its perturbative expansion to two - loop order in the next section .",
    "the strategy for the derivation of the weight function is to interchange integrations in ( [ eq : partialgamma ] ) so that the @xmath73 integration acts only on the jet function @xmath19 , and we can make use of ( [ eq : ydef ] ) . before this can be done , however , it is necessary to transform the other @xmath73-dependent terms in the partial decay rate into @xmath73-independent ones .",
    "this can be achieved by inserting @xmath74 into ( [ eq : partialgamma ] ) , and by replacing @xmath75 in @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath76 $ ] and in the kinematic prefactor @xmath77 .",
    "it is now an easy exercise to interchange the integrations @xmath78 next , we apply ( [ eq : ydef ] ) , interchange the @xmath71 and @xmath73 integrations , and undo the steps in ( [ eq : intchanges ] ) .",
    "finally the integrations over @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be carried out , which identifies @xmath81 . as a result",

    "the procedure is as follows : first , the integration limits @xmath35 , @xmath65 $ ] , and @xmath84 $ ] are specified from the kinematics of the cut . for the next step it is helpful to decompose @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are distributions in @xmath71 and independent of @xmath54 .",
    "( for example , we will see below that there are only three different distributions in the perturbative expansion of @xmath70 to two - loop order . )",
    "likewise , we decompose @xmath87 .",
    "it is then straight - forward to calculate the functions @xmath88 by integrating over @xmath89 and @xmath54 in ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
