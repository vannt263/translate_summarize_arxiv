    "any electrically charged gauge boson outside of the standard model ( sm ) is generically denoted @xmath0 . it is a hypothetical massive particle of electric charge @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 which always couples to two different flavors of quarks and ( or ) leptons , similar to the @xmath11 boson ( we do not discuss the situation that @xmath0 as a leptoquark gauge boson couples quarks to leptons ) .",
    "@xmath0 can be seen as minimal charged gauge boson extension for sm and is predicted in various new physics models , such as left - right symmetric models@xcite , alternate left - right model@xcite , ununified standard model@xcite , non - commuting extended technicolor@xcite , little higgs models@xcite , models of composite gauge bosons@xcite , super - symmetric top - flavor models@xcite , grand unification@xcite and superstring theories@xcite , extra - dimensions@xcite .",
    "theoretically , unitarity considerations imply that charged massive vector @xmath0s are gauge bosons associated with some spontaneously broken non - abelian gauge symmetry @xcite . this is true even when it is a composite particle like the charged techni-@xmath12 in technicolor theories@xcite or a kaluza - klein mode in theories where the @xmath11 boson propagates in extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "the minimal rank one non - abelian gauge group is @xmath13 . besides @xmath14 , the group @xmath13 demands the existence of extra neutral gauge boson @xmath1 . @xmath14 and @xmath1 together form a consistent minimal non - abelian @xmath13 gauge group .",
    "this gauge group must be completely spontaneously broken to give @xmath15 masses through higgs mechanism .",
    "the breaking mechanism is not known yet which depends on detail of the model .",
    "we can exploit nonlinear realization of the symmetry to avoid touching upon the details of the breaking mechanism .",
    "this is the @xmath13 chiral lagrangian for @xmath15 and three corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "now the new generation hadron collider lhc is going to run and people are eager expecting the discovery of the new particles .",
    "once the first new particle shows its signature in the collider experiment and its spin and parity are evaluated out , the following work is to check whether it belongs to any of exiting models . in general , for each kind of possible new particle , there are many candidate models predicting it and waiting for experiment to check .",
    "it is also possible that the real model our nature chosen is not presented in this candidate s list . to examine which kind of model",
    "this new particle belongs to and its interactions with those already discovered particles , we need a phenomenological theory which must be such general as to include various underlying discovered and undiscovered candidate models and cover all of its possible phenomenologies .",
    "we call this phenomenological theory the electroweak chiral lagrangian ( ewcl ) for the new particle which include this new particle and all those already discovered particles . the symmetry realization of this ewcl should at least include @xmath16 plus some new part from the new particle . on the platform of this ewcl ,",
    "on the one hand , we can perform model independent phenomenological investigation of the new particle and fix the corresponding parameters in ewcl from experiments , on the other hand , we can compute the parameters of ewcl from concrete underlying models . through comparison between parameters from experiments and",
    "that from underlying model , we hope the correct underlying model can be figured out .    in this paper , we are interested in a situation that except discovered particles in sm , the lowest new particles which are expected to show up in upcoming collider experiments are @xmath14 and @xmath1 . according to discussions above , to describe the corresponding physics phenomenologically , we are lead to set up a ewcl for @xmath15 and the symmetry realization of the theory will be generalized from original @xmath17 to @xmath2 for which one @xmath13 is for @xmath14 and @xmath1 and remaining ones are for sm electro - weak gauge bosons @xmath18 .",
    "naive extension of conventional unitarity analysis shows that this lagrangian will violate unitarity in tev energy region @xcite , and adding in theory a neutral higgs with mass below tev will kill the disaster . to keep our theory being unitary at tev energy region , we will further include in our theory a neutral higgs .",
    "thus our ewcl for @xmath15 now will include those already discovered particles , a neutral higgs , @xmath15 and corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "in fact , without @xmath15 and corresponding goldstone bosons , the ewcl only for a neutral higgs boson was already written down in ref.@xcite which was a generalization of original standard ewcl@xcite by adding a singlet higgs field to the theory .",
    "now our ewcl can be seen as a further extension of this generalized ewcl to include in theory @xmath15 and corresponding goldstone bosons . in this work ,",
    "we are especially interested in the case that the mass of @xmath14 is lighter or roughly same as that of @xmath1 .",
    "since if the mass of @xmath1 is much lighter than that of @xmath14 , the phenomenological interest will be changed to physics for lighter @xmath1 .",
    "the heavier @xmath14 then can be integrated out theoretically and we are led to ewcl purely for @xmath1 and neutral higgs boson .",
    "this ewcl was already discussed by us in another paper@xcite in which @xmath1 can be either an element of @xmath13 triplet or a remnant of some other underlying dynamics which has nothing to do with @xmath0 and can not be covered in our present theory .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that ewcl for @xmath1 is equivalent to an extended stueckelberg mechanism for @xmath19 gauge boson . from the point of view of stueckelberg mechanism ,",
    "our present ewcl for @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be further seen as @xmath13 non - abelian generalization of previous extended @xmath19 abelian stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "due to the passive roles of neutral higgs and @xmath1 , in this work we focus our attentions mainly on @xmath0 and related physics . for physics related to @xmath0 ,",
    "the strongest low energy phenomenological constraints come from @xmath20 mixing , @xmath21 mass differences and related cp violation parameters . on the platform of our ewcl",
    ", we can explore these constraints in detail , transferring them to the constraints on parameters of our ewcl and ckm matrix elements for right hand fermions .",
    "we will find that some of these constraints such as mixings among different particles are universal , while others are model class dependent .",
    "it should be emphasized that our ewcl will only cover those underlying models which include massive @xmath15 and neutral higgs as lowest new particles beyond those already discovered particles . for those models which include new particle with mass lighter than @xmath0 or new particle combining with discovered particle together forms an irreducible representation of @xmath13 group@xcite , our ewcl do not cover the corresponding physics .",
    "we argue for this alternative situation , a separate ewcl can be built to describe it and this situation will be investigated elsewhere .    within the range of our ewcl ,",
    "a special type of models are left - right symmetric models@xcite which explore the possibility of spontaneous parity violation .",
    "the ewcl for this kind models is built up by some of us in ref.@xcite for the bosonic part and ref.@xcite for the matter part . since we are interested in the general description for @xmath0 and @xmath1 physics , it is purpose of this paper to generalize the discussion in ref.@xcite to cover left - right non - symmetric models . for bosonic part of ewcl ,",
    "no matter which kind of model involving @xmath0 and @xmath1 , since gauge bosons and corresponding goldstone bosons are all in triplet of @xmath22 group , their interactions then are fixed as those given in ref.@xcite .",
    "while for matter part , various models provide at least following different arrangements for fermion representations@xcite :    1 .",
    "left - right symmetric ( lr)@xcite :  left hand fermions belong to doublet of @xmath23 and singlet of @xmath22 ; right hand fermions belong to doublet of @xmath22 and singlet of @xmath23 .",

    "non - universal ( nu)@xcite :  one or two special family left hand fermions ( typical situation is the first two light families ) belong to doublet of @xmath23 and singlet of @xmath22 ; remaining left hand fermions belong to doublet of @xmath22 and singlet of @xmath23 ; right hand fermions belong to singlet of @xmath24 .",
    "the matter part ewcl given in ref.@xcite only involves situation 1 in which although the arrangement of fermion representations is left - right symmetric , the couplings may or may not be left - right symmetric .",
    "considering the fact that conventional ewcl formalism only deals with the system with particles fixed in some special group representations , the generalization of the expression to cover different fermion representation arrangements is not a trivial work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec.ii is the introduction of a our ewcl which covers all above situations . for the bosonic part we accurate up to order of @xmath3 . for matter part ,",
    "we limit us in dimension three yukawa type and dimension four gauge interaction terms . in sec.iii",
