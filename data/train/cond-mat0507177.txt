    "low - dimensional ( one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi - one dimensional ) gapped spin systems such as spin - peierls , haldane and spin ladder systems have drawn attention from both theorists and experimentalists in the literature after the prediction by haldane @xcite that a 1d heisenberg antiferromagnet should have an energy gap between the singlet ground state and the first excited triplet states in the case of an integer spin quantum number @xmath0 , while the energy levels are gapless in the case of a half - odd integer values of @xmath0 .",
    "the most fascinating characteristic of these systems is to show magnetic plateaus i.e. topological quantization of the magnetization at the ground state of the system due to magnetic excitations .",
    "a general condition for the quantization of the magnetization in low - dimensional magnetic systems is derived from the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem @xcite .",
    "oshikawa , yamanaka and affleck ( oya ) @xcite discussed this plateau problem and derived a condition @xmath1 , necessary for the appearance of the plateau in the magnetization curve of one - dimensional spin system , where @xmath0 is the magnitude of spin , @xmath2 is the magnetization per site and @xmath3 is the spatial period of the ground state , respectively .",
    "this condition emphasize that the @xmath4 magnetization plateaus ( contained the saturated magnetization @xmath5 ) can appear when the magnetic field increases from zero to its saturation value @xmath6 , however , it does not directly prove its existence @xcite .    in many theoretical studies , it has been found that low - dimensional gapped spin systems have magnetic plateaus at low temperatures or ground state as providing oya criterion .",
    "for example , chen et al .",
    "@xcite employed the classical monte carlo technique to investigate the magnetization plateaus of 1d classic spin-@xmath7 and spin-@xmath8 af ising chain with a single - ion anisotropy under the external field at low temperatures , and they showed that the systems have @xmath4 magnetic plateaus .",
    "tonegawa et al .",
    "@xcite observed the plateau at @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in the ground state of spin-@xmath7 af heisenberg chain with bond alternating and uniaxial single - ion anisotropy .",
    "sato and kindo obtained a magnetic plateau at @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for spin-@xmath7 bond alternating heisenberg chain by using renormalization group technique @xcite .",
    "hida observed that an @xmath11 antiferromagnetic chain with period-3 exchange coupling shows a plateau in the magnetization curve at magnetization per site @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "totsuka found a plateau at @xmath13 for the familiar @xmath11 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with the next - nearest - neighbor and alternating nearest - neighbour interactions using the bosonization technique @xcite .",
    "sakai and takahashi found that a magnetization plateau appears at @xmath14 for the @xmath15 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain by the exact diagonalization of finite clusters and finite - size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "obtained half - saturated plateau of @xmath13 in the @xmath11 xxz chain in @xmath16 phase exposed to a weak period-4 field @xcite .",
    "_ numerically obtained the magnetic plateau @xmath14 in the @xmath15 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with single ion anisotropy @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "aydiner and akyz obtained magnetic plateaus for spin-1 using classical transfer matrix technique @xcite .",
    "okamoto also found out the magnetization plateau in alternating spin chains @xcite .    on the other hand , magnetic plateaus",
    "have been predicted not only in theoretical study but also have been observed in experimental studies .",
    "for example , narumi et al .",
    "@xcite observed the magnetic plateaus in the magnetization curve for both [ ni@xmath18(medpt)@xmath18(@xmath19-ox)(h@xmath18o)@xmath18](clo@xmath21)@xmath182h@xmath18o and [ ni@xmath18(medpt)@xmath18(@xmath19-ox)(@xmath19-n@xmath22)](clo@xmath21)0.5 h@xmath18o .",
    "goto et al .",
    "@xcite reported the existence of the magnetization plateau at @xmath23 in spin-@xmath7 3,3,5,5-tetrakis ( n - tert - butylaminxyl ) biphenyl ( bip - teno ) .    in the majority of plateau mechanisms which have been proposed up to now the purely quantum phenomena play crucial role .",
    "the concept of magnetic quasi - particles and strong quantum fluctuation are regarded to be first importance of these processes .",
    "particularly , for a number of systems it was shown that the plateau at @xmath24 are caused by the presence of the spin gap in the spectrum of magnetic excitation in the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "another mechanism lies in so - called crystallization of the magnetic particles @xcite . meanwhile , even though the phenomenon of magnetization plateaus are often regarded to have purely quantum origin , it is obviously not clear since one - dimensional @xcite and two dimensional @xcite quasi - classical spin models which exhibit a magnetization plateaus at zero temperature or near the ground state .",
    "in fact , these studies show to us that heisenberg and ising spins leads to the qualitatively same structures of the magnetization profiles , particularly to the formation of magnetization plateaus . according to our knowledge , magnetic plateaus",
    "can appear depend on dimerization , frustration , single - ion anisotropy or periodic field for one - dimensional af spin chain independent of whether the classical or not quantum models .",
    "therefore , we say that one of these ingredients is required for a plateau mechanism .    in this study , we shall investigate the one - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin-3/2 and spin-2 ising chains with single - ion anisotropy to obtain magnetic plateaus and other thermodynamical quantities taking into account the analogy of the magnetization profiles between heisenberg and ising spin systems .",
    "the approach is based on very simple idea to use the ising spin instead of the heisenberg operators and to develop the classical transfer matrix technique .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that in contrast to the majority of existing approaches to the problem of magnetization plateau , this technique is entirely based on analytical calculations and allows to obtain the magnetization profiles for arbitrary finite temperature and arbitrary values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", we must remark that the transfer matrix approach to the 1d classical system is rather simple as compared with other techniques , however , the implementation of this technique leads to remarkable simplicity and clarity and produces considerably exact results for 1d infinite spin system .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present classical hamiltonian for spin-@xmath0 system with single - ion anisotropy and briefly introduce transfer matrix technique . in section 3 and 4 we give numerical results for spin-3/2 and spin-2 , respectively .",
    "the last section gives our conclusions .",
    "in point of classical view , hamiltonian for the 1d spin-@xmath0 system with single - ion anisotropy can be written as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath25 denotes the exchange coupling of antiferromagnetic type ( i.e @xmath29 ) , @xmath26 is the single - ion anisotropy , @xmath27 is the external field , and _",
    "n _ is the total number of site in the system .",
    "herein , in order to investigate the magnetic and thermal properties of 1d af spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath30 ising chain , we are interested in the three thermodynamical expressions ( i ) ferromagnetic order @xmath2 , ( ii ) the specific heat @xmath31 , and ( iii ) the magnetic susceptibility @xmath32 .",
    "these quantities are calculated in terms of free energy as    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    then the free energy for the system can be found exactly in terms of the partition function with the help of the transfer matrix technique .",
    "hence , all thermodynamic functions in eq . ( 2 ) are respectively calculated .",
    "the free energy per spin of this system is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents transfer matrix of the spin system , which we give below .",
    "it is known that a conventional way to calculate the free energy is to write the partition function ( 4 ) in terms of eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath38 as follows : @xmath39 according to the standard assumptions of this technique , partition function ( 5 ) is represented as , @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ... which are sorted from the biggest to smallest .",
    "it is clearly seen that the second and the third terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( 6 ) go to zero as @xmath44 due to @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and so on .",
    "hence the free energy eq .",
    "( 3 ) is practically reduced to @xmath47 this result implied that the magnetic and thermodynamical quantities in eq .",
    "( 2 ) for the present system can be evaluated depend on the biggest eigenvalue @xmath48 .    for spin-3/2",
    ", @xmath49 takes on @xmath50 , and @xmath51 values , on the other hand , for spin-2 , @xmath49 takes on @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 values .",
    "considering the fact that , for example , we can write the transfer matrix @xmath38 for spin-3/2 as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath61 is the temperature . the transfer matrix @xmath38 for spin-2 can be constructed in a similar way .",
    "the numerical results for spin-3/2 are as follow : in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , the magnetization @xmath2 were respectively plotted as a function of external field @xmath27 for fixed values of @xmath62 , and @xmath63 at @xmath64 ( unit by @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) that @xmath65 plateaus appear , located at @xmath66 , and @xmath63 , which satisfies the oya s criterion for all values of positive single - ion anisotropy @xmath26 at the low temperature near the ground state under the external field @xmath27 .",
    "appearance of the magnetic plateaus indicate that the 1d af spin-3/2 ising chain has a gap mechanism owing to single ion - anisotropy .",
    "previous theoretical studies @xcite show that single ion - anisotropy play a crucial role to appear magnetic plateaus for classical ising chains .",
    "our result also confirms previous theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the transitions between magnetic plateaus occur at critical field values .",
    "the nonzero magnetization at @xmath67 begins from a finite external field which called as initial critical field @xmath68 .",
    "second plateau at @xmath69 appears at second critical field value @xmath70 .",
    "the last plateau corresponds to the value of saturation magnetization of the system , that we called it as saturated field @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have no observed a magnetization plateau for @xmath72 .",
    "this observation indicate that single ion - anisotropy is one of the necessary ingredient to plateau mechanism for the present system .",
    "in fact , @xmath26 values change width of plateaus as seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in order to see this effect , magnetic phase diagram @xmath73 was plotted in fig .",
    "this phase diagram displays the behavior of the system depend on single ion - anisotropy near the ground temperature i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "however , this phase picture does not clearly show the effect of exchange interaction @xmath25 .",
    "three lines in fig .",
    "2(a ) correspond to critical field values which are responsible of plateau transition .",
    "four plateau areas i.e. , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath10 , and @xmath63 are divided by the initial critical field @xmath68 , second critical field @xmath70 and the saturated field @xmath71 lines for values of @xmath76 as shown in fig.2(a ) .",
    "areas between these lines give information how width of the plateaus can change depend on single ion - anisotropy .",
    "the longitudinal coordinate of the square - dot is the beginning point of the field for appearance of the plateau @xmath67 which corresponds to the first critical field @xmath68 values , the plateau @xmath69 is denoted by the circular - dot which corresponds to the second critical field @xmath70 values , and its ending point is signed by the triangle - dot which correspond to the saturated field @xmath6 values .",
    "it is clearly seen that the initial field line and second critical field line have a critical behavior at the @xmath77 while the saturated field increasing monotonously with the rise of @xmath26 .",
    "the first critical field decreases in the regime @xmath78 with the increase of @xmath26 , however , it lies longitudinal for @xmath79 . on the other hand , the second critical field increasing monotonously with the rise of @xmath26 for @xmath79 , while it lies longitudinal for @xmath80 . as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) , value of @xmath77 behaves as a critical point for both first and second critical field values .",
    "reason of this behavior is chosen as @xmath81 .",
    "the magnetization phase diagram in fig.2(a ) is compatible with the monte carlo prediction @xcite .",
    "the width of the plateau @xmath67 increases with @xmath26 increasing for the present system , whereas it remains in heisenberg chain with single - ion anisotropy @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the width of the plateaus @xmath74 and @xmath69 are independent of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath26 , which is similar to that of @xmath67 in one - dimensional @xmath83 antiferromagnetic ising chain with single - ion anisotropy @xcite .",
    "though the magnetic phase diagram in fig .",
    "2(a ) of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) gives information about depending single ion - anisotropy , however , it does not display how the spin exchange strength @xmath25 contribute to plateau mechanism . in order to understand effect of @xmath25 to the plateau ,",
    "we have studied in the limit of @xmath84 . for the simplicity we have chosen an extreme values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and magnetization",
    "were plotted versus external field for these values in fig.2(b ) .",
    "it is seen that the only intermediate plateau @xmath67 expands to depress the range of the other plateaus @xmath74 and @xmath69 in this limit .",
    "this result also indicate that spin exchange parameter @xmath25 plays a significant role on the plateau mechanism as well as single ion - anisotropy @xmath26 . at the extreme case of @xmath85",
    ", we can easily understand that it is equal to single - particle system with two plateaus @xmath67 and @xmath63 in the ground magnetization .    in order to obtain the behavior of the specific heat @xmath31 depending on the external field @xmath27 and the single - ion anisotropy @xmath26 at low temperatures , they are plotted as a function of temperature @xmath61 , for the fixed value of the single - ion anisotropy , @xmath87 , at various values of the external field @xmath88 , and @xmath89 in fig.3(a ) and for the fixed value of @xmath90 at various values of @xmath91 , and @xmath92 in fig.3(b ) , respectively .",
    "the specific heat curves in fig.3(a ) and fig.3(b ) have a relatively board maximum like the schottky peak near @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively . as can be seen from fig.3(a ) , the height of the specific heat peak for the fixed value of @xmath26 decreases and moves towards zero temperature when the external field @xmath27 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the height of the specific heat peak for the fixed value of @xmath27 decreases and moves towards zero temperature when the value of single - ion anisotropy increases in fig.3(b ) .",
    "we note that the schottky - like round hump in the specific heat probably reflects the fact that the energy of the system depends on the external field @xmath27 , and the single - ion anisotropy @xmath26 .",
    "however , they do not indicate that a second - order phase transition occurs in the one - dimensional system .",
    "all of them may be thought as a schottky - like peak resulting from the antiferromagnetic short - range order .",
    "another way of the confirmation of multi - plateau magnetization curves by numerical calculation in the 1d af ising chain is to examine the field and temperature dependence of susceptibility @xmath32 in fig.4(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it is expected that the temperature dependence of the susceptibility gives information that whether the low - dimensional system has an energy gap or not , while field dependence of it verify formation of plateaus .",
    "therefore , the susceptibility is plotted in fig.4(a ) as a function of external field @xmath27 .",
    "it can be seen that there are three peaks in the susceptibility for @xmath87 and @xmath64 .",
    "the first peak occurs at the initial critical field value , the second peak occurs at the second critical field value and the third peak occurs at the saturated field value for the fixed value of @xmath26 .",
    "each peak indicates the transitions from one magnetic plateau to another one .",
    "furthermore , we have also plotted the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for fixed value of @xmath87 and for three selected external fields @xmath95 , and @xmath96 in fig.4(b ) .",
    "the curve for @xmath97 marked by triangular - dot line show a relatively sharp peak at low temperature , while the other curves for @xmath98 , and @xmath96 have a broad maximum which are denoted by circular - dot and square - dot line , respectively .",
    "we roughly say that the susceptibility curves decay exponentially with the increasing temperature by the relation @xmath99 .",
    "the peaks or round hump behavior in the magnetic susceptibility curves in fig.4(b ) may be interpreted as evidence the formation of the short - range correlations within the chains . in that case",
    ", these correlations may play a role for gap mechanism just as in heisenberg af systems .",
    "this characteristic behavior in the susceptibility clearly compatible with the experimental results for spin-@xmath8 compound cs@xmath18crcl@xmath100.4h@xmath18o @xcite .",
    "we start our discussion once again with investigating the properties of one - dimensional af spin-@xmath30 ising chain with single - ion anisotropy .",
    "now , we consider the above hamiltonian ( 1 ) for the case of spin-@xmath30 . in the case of spin-3/2 the physical quantities such as the magnetization ,",
    "the magnetization phase diagram , the specific heat , and the magnetic susceptibility were evaluated numerically to keep in this system of spin-2 .",
    "we have plotted the magnetization @xmath2 as a function of external field @xmath27 for only fixed values of @xmath86 and @xmath64 ( unit by @xmath25 ) as shown in fig .",
    "the number of the plateaus obey to oya criterion for spin-2 chain in the case of the spin-@xmath8 chain .",
    "the plateaus appear at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath10 , @xmath63 , and @xmath96 for all values of positive single - ion anisotropy @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "5(a ) that there are three critical fields as @xmath68 , @xmath70 and @xmath101 in the spin-@xmath30 chain . on the other hand ,",
    "we have plotted the magnetization @xmath2 as a function of the external field @xmath27 for only fixed values of @xmath86 and for the extreme case of @xmath85 in fig .",
    "5(b ) to see behavior of the present system in the limit of @xmath84 . in this limit",
    ", the spin-2 ising chain has the three plateaus at @xmath74 , @xmath10 , and @xmath96 . at the extreme case of @xmath85",
    ", one can easily suggest that it is equal to two - particle system with three plateaus at @xmath74 , @xmath10 , and @xmath96 in the ground magnetization .    the single ion - anisotropy dependence of the magnetization plateaus of 1d af spin-2 ising chain near the ground state were presented in @xmath73 space in fig .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the phase diagram of the spin-@xmath30 chain is similar to that of the spin-@xmath8 chain .",
    "the saturated field increasing monotonously with the rise of @xmath26 , however , all critical field values i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath70 , and @xmath101 have a critical behavior at the @xmath77 due to choosing of @xmath102 .",
    "the first and second critical fields decrease in the regime @xmath78 with increase of @xmath26 , but they increasing monotonously with the rise of @xmath26 .",

    ", the width of the plateau @xmath69 increases with @xmath26 increasing for the present system , however , the width of the plateaus @xmath67 and @xmath69 remain constant for values of @xmath79 , while they increase with @xmath26 increasing up to @xmath77 as seen from fig .",
    "the magnetization phase diagram of the ground state of af spin-@xmath30 ising chain under finite magnetic field .",
    "the square - dot line , the circular - dot line , the upper triangle - dot line , and the lower triangle - dot line represent the initial critical field , the second critical field , the third critical field , and the saturated field , respectively.,width=283,height=245 ]    the temperature dependence of the specific heat for different field values and fixed value of @xmath26 is shown in fig.7(a ) and for different single ion - anisotropy values and fixed field value of @xmath27 is shown in fig.7(b ) , respectively .",
    "one can suggested that the physical behavior of specific heat of spin-2 chain has the same characteristic with spin-3/2 .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from fig.7(a ) , the height of the specific heat peak for the fixed value of @xmath26 decreases and moves towards zero temperature when the external field @xmath27 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the height of the specific heat peak for the fixed value of @xmath27 decreases and moves towards zero temperature when the value of single - ion anisotropy increases in fig.7(b ) .",
    "finally , we have plotted the magnetic susceptibility versus external field for fixed @xmath26 in fig.8(a ) and versus the temperature for different values of @xmath27 and fixed value of @xmath26 in fig.8(b ) , respectively .",
    "the peaks in fig.8(a ) indicate the critical field values transition from one plateau to another one for the spin-2 chain . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the susceptibility curves in fig.8(b ) clearly provide that 1d af spin-2 ising chain has an energy gap which leads to the magnetic plateaus .",
    "in this study , using by quasi - classical hamiltonian(1 ) , we have evaluated the magnetic and thermal properties of 1d af spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath30 ising chain with a single - ion anisotropy in the presence of an external magnetic field at low temperature in the framework of the transfer matrix formalism .",
    "the most important result stemming from this study is the confirmation of a multi step magnetization process by a numerical calculation for both in the case of a half - odd integer , and an integer spin quantum @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , we found out that the @xmath4 step - like magnetization plateaus of the system appear for all values of positive single - ion anisotropy @xmath103 in both spin system , when the external field varied from zero to the saturated field .",
    "in addition , the magnetic plateau does not appear for @xmath72 in these spin systems , however , at extreme value of @xmath85 we observed that the spin-@xmath8 ising chain has two plateaus at @xmath67 and @xmath63 and then spin-@xmath30 ising chain has three plateaus at @xmath74 , @xmath10 , and @xmath96 .",
    "these evidences confirm that single ion - anisotropy and the nearest - neighbor interaction contribute to be formed the magnetic plateaus .",
    "therefore , plateau forms in the 1d af spin-@xmath0 ising chains can be explain owing to the co - existence of antiferromagnetic interaction of @xmath104 and positive single - ion anisotropy @xmath105 .",
    "the plateau predictions in this study are compatible with previous theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present results provide that there is a class of one - dimensional spin systems which in terms of heisenberg and ising spins lead to the qualitatively same structures of the magnetization profiles , particularly to the formation of magnetization plateaus . hence , we suggest that the quasi - classical approach can be used to examine the magnetic and thermal behaviors of 1d af spin-@xmath0 ising chains as well as the heisenberg hamiltonian",
    ".    unfortunately , we have not compare our thermodynamical results with the experimental results since there are no enough experimental studies for these systems in the literature .",
    "however , it is understand from present theoretical evidences that the magnetic and thermal characteristic of the 1d af spin-@xmath0 ising chains are the same .",
    "therefore , we expected that our results will be agreement with the experimental results of the ideal spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath30 compounds .",
    "finally , we stated that one does not expect any spin - peierls transition in these models , because there is no physical mechanism for it within a model constructed purely from @xmath106 operator , without any coupling to the lattice .",
    "a spin - peierls transition may occurs only due to a small amount of magnetic impurities and derivations from stoichiometry of the compound synthesized experimentally @xcite ."
