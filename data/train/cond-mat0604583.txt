    "quantum transport theory  @xcite has recently been one of the most exciting fields of condensed matter physics .",
    "the field not only has a great promise for providing theoretical framework for the design of nanoscale electronic devices , but also has been a frontier of quantum many - body theory in nonequilibrium .    in regards to predicting behavior of nano - electronic devices the current theories based on non - equilibrium green function technique  @xcite have been quite successful .",
    "however , as we approach strongly correlated regime of transport  @xcite under extreme nonequilibrium conditions , approximate green function techniques become increasingly unreliable .",
    "one can make an analogy to the equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics , where the combination of diagrammatic methods and computational techniques has been vital for the great success in the quantum many - body theory during the past decades .",
    "therefore , it is a pressing issue that we have an alternative theoretical scheme to implement the computational techniques to nonequilibrium problems . recently",
    "new approaches have been proposed to solve nonequilibrium .",
    "mehta and andrei  @xcite have applied the non - equilibrium bethe ansatz technique to solve the interacting resonant - level model .",
    "renormalization group theory has been extended to nonequilibrium systems  @xcite to investigate the time - dependence  @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems in applying numerical techniques to transport problems has been the lack of understanding of nonequilibrium ensemble , specifically , as to how nonequilibrium boundary conditions can be implemented as a statistical operator . in steady - state nonequilibrium",
    ", zubarev  @xcite has extended the gibbsian statistical mechanics to incorporate steady - state boundary conditions in the density matrix formalism .",
    "later , hershfield  @xcite has shown that the nonequilibrium ensemble can be expressed in the effective boltzmann factor @xmath3 with the bias operator , @xmath1 , in terms of the scattering state operators .",
    "once the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 inside the boltzmann factor is obtained , one can use the equilibrium numerical techniques to sample the nonequilibrium ensemble .    despite the great potential , application of the method",
    "has been limited due to the difficulties in constructing the bias operator  @xcite .",
    "recently , the method has been implemented by the author  @xcite in the system of quantum dot ( qd ) coupled with electron - phonon interaction . in the work",
    ", he has approximately constructed the bias operator @xmath1 by truncating the non - local interaction arising from the nonequilibrium boundary condition and by expanding the scattering state operators up to the harmonic order of the electron - phonon interaction . however , in the strongly correlated limit , such perturbative expansion of the scattering state may not be sufficient to reproduce the many - particle transport such as the kondo anomaly conductance .    ultimately , it is desirable that we develop a general computational scheme of mapping nonequilibrium system to an effective equilibrium hamiltonian , so that equilibrium techniques such as quantum monte carlo method can be used to directly calculate nonequilibrium properties .",
    "however , to achieve the goal , we must have a good understanding of the properties of the nonequilibrium ensemble .",
    "therefore , in order to gain physical insights of the mapping , we first study the diagrammatic construction of the nonequilibrium ensemble .",
    "the first main goal of this paper is to derive general analytical properties of scattering state operators , especially the anti - commutation and completeness relations in the interacting limit , and derive various expressions of the boundary condition operator . by clarifying the fundamental questions on the properties of scattering state operators , we lay a foundation of the mapping the nonequilibrium .",
    "furthermore , we show that the nonequilibrium mapping produces the correct theory in the zero - bias limit .",
    "the second goal is , by taking an example , to address what correlation effects have to be included in the bias operator @xmath1 to properly describe the strongly correlated transport . to this end",
    ", we consider the anderson impurity hamiltonian as a model for kondo dot systems .",
    "we might expect that , since the original hamiltonian has a strong on - site interaction , the strong correlation effects will be described simply by shifting chemical potentials in the source , drain reservoirs .",
    "however , it will be shown in this work that it is essential to include the correlation effects at the level of hamiltonian in the boundary condition to produce the kondo anomaly  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , we introduce the idea of mapping the nonequilibrium and present the analytic properties of the scattering state and the bias operators .",
    "the proofs are provided in appendices . in the following section  [ sec : anderson]-a",
    ", we develop a procedure to expand the scattering state operator using the slave - boson representation of the qd states in the infinite on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "we derive expression for the scattering state operators and give physical interpretations in the expansion . in the next subsection  [ sec : anderson]-b",
    ", we construct the bias operator @xmath1 and explain how the nonequilibrium hamiltonian is calculated in the non - crossing approximation in the equilibrium picture . in the subsection  [ sec : anderson]-c , we derive an approximate expression for the current . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present numerical results and discuss strong correlation effects in the differential conductance . in section  [ sec : sc ] , we discuss how the limitations in the previous section can be improved in a self - consistent algorithm .",
    "in this section , we discuss the general properties of scattering state operators with many - body interactions present in quantum dot systems and obtain expressions for the bias operator in a simple form .",
    "we prove that the zero - bias limit in the mapping of nonequilibrium produces the kubo formula .",
    "the detailed derivations are presented in appendix .",
    "the general scattering theory has been well - studied and its formalism can be found in many textbooks  @xcite .",
    "however , most of them are studied in terms of state vector notation and here we present some of the relations in the operator form . we first consider a quite general model of quantum dot systems .",
    "the constraint is that the many - body interaction is confined to the quantum dot .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger scattering state operator @xmath5 is expressed  @xcite in the operator equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the free continuum state creation operator inside the reservoir @xmath8 at the asymptotic energy @xmath9 with the continuum index @xmath10 and spin @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is a infinitesimal positive number to define the asymptotic limit of the scattering state .",
    "@xcite here the liouville operators for the full hamiltonian @xmath13 and the interaction @xmath14 are defined in the commutation relation such as @xmath15 $ ] for any operator .",
    "the @xmath16 index refers to the reservoir [ @xmath17 source reservoir ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 drain reservoir ( @xmath20 ) ] .",
    "since the hamiltonian has many - body interactions , the scattering state operator @xmath21 has terms with many - particle operators , and it is not clear if they obey the regular fermion anti - commutation relation . in non - interacting models , it can be shown straightforwardly that the anti - commutation relation holds .",
    "it is shown in appendix a that the following commutation relation holds even in the interacting limit : @xmath22 therefore , @xmath23 work like typical fermion operators and any scattering state created by repeated application of @xmath21 s on a particle - vacuum can be considered a many - body scattering state .",
    "one of the obstacles in implementing the mapping of nonequilibrium has been the lack of understanding of the bias condition operator suggested by hershfield  @xcite , @xmath24 we reduce the @xmath1 operator in a physically appealing form in appendix b as @xmath25 , \\label{eq : ywithi}\\ ] ] with the current operator @xmath26 which will be defined later .",
    "although the bias operator has been derived from the boundary condition imposed with respect to the chemical potential difference , the above formula relates the potential - driven ensemble to a current - driven ensemble  @xcite .",
    "expressing the bias operator in terms of current operator becomes particularly useful in proving the zero - bias limit of the conductance .",
    "the formulation of nonequilibrium mapping via @xmath1 must produce the same kubo formula in equilibrium theory .",
    "the proof in appendix c shows that the mapping of nonequilibrium has the correct description of transport physics in the low - bias limit .",
    "so far , the present formulation of nonequilibrium has been shown to be correct in the non - interacting models at finite bias  @xcite and in the interacting models in the zero - bias limit .",
    "the notion that we can treat the scattering states as independent dynamical degrees of freedom has been the central idea in the mapping of nonequilibrium . in the non - interacting model  @xcite ,",
    "the scattering state operators are on a firm ground due to the anti - commutation relation mentioned above and the completeness of the scattering states encapsulated in the following identity @xmath27 provided that there exist no bound states , which is the case in the limit of large bandwidth . in the interacting systems , the scattering state operators @xmath5 become dressed with multi - particle scattering .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 should be defined in the many - particle basis and the validity of the above equation is not obvious . in appendix d",
    ", we derive the relation for a fairly general class of interactions .",
    "similarly , behind the idea of writing the bias operator @xmath1 by shifting the chemical potential of @xmath5 , we expect for a consistent theory that @xmath28 and therefore @xmath29 we derive a general relation for the above summation in appendix d and explicitly demonstrate that the relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete ] ) holds for the anderson impurity model .",
    "this relation corresponds to the intertwining relation in the @xmath30-matrix formalism in the absence of bound states . even if the products @xmath31 has a quadratic form , they contain many - body interactions to infinite orders in the original basis",
    "however , after the summation over all @xmath32 indices , only finite order terms up to the original hamiltonian survive .",
    "for the remainder of this paper until section  [ sec : sc ] , we will consider an example of electron transport in the infinite-@xmath0 anderson model as a model for strongly correlated transport system .",
    "in such systems where local interaction dominates the electronic structure , it is natural to choose the local states as the unperturbed states .",
    "one of the very successful and popular methods is the slave - boson technique , often used in the limit of infinite interaction strength . in our model , by letting the on - site coulomb interaction to be infinite , we effectively project out the hilbert space associated with @xmath33 qd states .",
    "therefore the available local hilbert space is @xmath34 , constrained by the relation @xmath35 due to the truncation of the hilbert space , the qd states @xmath36 can not be represented by ordinary fermion operators .",
    "one of the techniques to overcome this problem is the slave - boson method , where we associate the empty state @xmath37 by a bosonic state @xmath38 , created by a slave - boson creation operator @xmath39 on an imaginary vacuum @xmath40 and the singly - occupied states @xmath36 by @xmath41 with pseudo - fermion operator @xmath42 .",
    "the above constraint can be now recast in the following operator relation , @xmath43 under the assumption of the above projection , the hamiltonian can be written in terms of fermion - boson operators as @xmath44 with the qd level energy @xmath45 , tunneling amplitude @xmath46 and the volume factor @xmath47 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath48 has the reservoir continua and local basis as disconnected .",
    "the perturbation term @xmath49 turns on the tunneling between the reservoirs and the quantum dot .",
    "since the steady - state ensemble must be time - independent , we construct the nonequilibrium boundary condition in terms of the scattering states  @xcite .",
    "the scattering state creation operator @xmath5 can be written in the lippmann - schwinger equation  @xcite : @xmath50 with the liouville operator @xmath51 with respect to @xmath48 defined as @xmath52 $ ] for an arbitrary operator @xmath53 , and similarly @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "this formula is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lippmann ] ) .",
    "the scattering state operator is expanded in a perturbation series of the tunneling part @xmath14 , @xmath55 the @xmath56-th order term can be derived recursively as @xmath57 the statistical operator @xmath1 for the nonequilibrium boundary condition is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : y ] ) .",
    "if the interaction is local , one can easily see that the scattered part of the wave - function , @xmath58 , has the @xmath10-dependence only through @xmath9 . to eliminate unnecessary band - edge effects and bound states , we consider a infinite band lorentzian density of states ( dos )  @xcite for the both reservoirs @xmath59 with the half - bandwidth @xmath60 .",
    "then at @xmath61 we have @xmath62 .",
    "after the @xmath10-summation with the dos of broad bandwidth and by assuming the symmetric source - drain parameters , we have a cancellation between @xmath63 and @xmath64 in @xmath1 : @xmath65 with @xmath66      we expand the scattering state operator @xmath5 as depicted in fig .",

    "@xmath70 from now on , we use a shorthand notation @xmath71 .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume the left - right symmetry and the tunneling amplitudes are independent of @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath72 .    in the @xmath73 term , we first compute @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 has been used in the above calculation since any physical state subject to the constraint eq .",

    "here we replace the pairs of electron operators in the numerator of the self - energy operator with average values in the asymptotic limit , @xmath98 , with the fermi - dirac function @xmath99 .",
