    "depending on the type and concentration of surfactant molecules and added salt , solutions of surfactant wormlike micelles have shear thinning or thickening behavior under shear flow . unlike most fluids , wormlike micelles often have non - analytic flow curves with sharply - selected plateaus along which strain rate or stress may change discontinuously . in the well documented case of shear thinning solutions the usual explanation of the constant stress plateau",
    "is shear banding @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ a separation of the material into bands of different viscosities , triggered by a constitutive instability ( such as an isotropic - to - nematic transition @xcite ) . as shown recently @xcite , the stress selection and history independence of shear banding can be explained using the inhomogeneities of the relevant mesoscopic order parameter ( polymer stress ) , _ i.e. _ by incorporating `` diffusive '' terms in the constitutive equations .",
    "order parameter diffusion was introduced long time ago by van der waals in the so - called `` gradient theory '' of the gas - liquid interface @xcite , and is obligatory in phase field models for pattern formation .",
    "notwithstanding a few attempts to deal with inhomogeneous stresses @xcite the same concept has not obtained full acceptance in the rheological community . while one might argue that diffusion terms are negligibly small , these _ non - perturbative _ terms resolve stress selection even for infinitesimal values @xcite . however , a small diffusion coefficient should also imply a slow approach to steady state ; the main purpose of this letter is to demonstrate these long time scales experimentally and relate them to simple model diffusive behavior .",
    "shear banding involves spatial inhomogeneity and several temporal stages .",
    "light polarization probes the local micellar orientation , while rheology detects the molecular stress . in this work",
    "we shall calculate the stress transients using a theoretical model .",
    "this will be compared to birefringence measurements that are assumed to probe the state of molecular orientation and hence stress ( but see ref .",
    "@xcite ) rather than the typical start - up transient experiment , we consider the simpler experiment of a step between two fixed values of the shear rate in the banded regime .",
    "small steps should induce less drastic changes in the fluid while still remaining in the non - linear regime , and hopefully yield more controllable results .",
    "the transient features will be shown to be intimately related to the dynamics of the interface between the bands .",

    "the initial dynamics is governed by inertia ; within a very short time @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for @xmath43 and a gap @xmath44 ) momentum diffuses across the gap and the momentum balance becomes @xmath45 .",

    "this divergence is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite : controlled stress experiments have much longer relaxation times on the metastable extension of the high viscosity branch above the constant stress plateau .",
    "consider an initial banded steady state , with average shear rate @xmath74 . suddenly increasing the average shear rate to @xmath75 produces a stress overshoot because the amount of high viscosity i band is too large ; both i and n bands then become unstable , and the stress can decrease by producing more of the low viscosity n material .",
    "numerical simulation ( figs.[f.1 ] , [ f.3 ] ) shows that this occurs in three stages :    _ 1 .",
    "band i destabilization_ during this stage the i band tries a direct passage toward the nematic band n , fig.[f.3]a ) .",
    "complete transformation is forbidden by the average shear rate constraint and the i band stops before reaching the basin of attraction of the steady n band .",
    "a representation of the subsequent kinetics in the @xmath76 plane ( fig .  [ f.2]b ) shows that _ the n band almost follows the steady flow curve , while the i band evolves at constant shear rate_. thus , the characteristic time @xmath77 is controlled by the i band dynamics .",
    "the total shear stress at the end of this stage depends on the final position of the interface and is sensitive to the details of the constitutive model .",
    "if this value is below the plateau one finds an undershoot ( as in the numerical simulation fig .",
    "[ f.1]b ) , and otherwise the subsequent stress evolution is monotonic ( fig .",
    "[ f.1]a ) .",
    "although we did not succeed in reproducing monotonic evolution using the js model , as long the i band evolves at a constant shear rate , the magnitude of the characteristic time should not be affected by the presence or absence of an undershoot .",
    "interface reconstruction_ at the end of stage 1 the interface separates an unsteady i band close to the unstable saddle point from a nearly stable n band . the part of the profile closer to the i attractor will evolve toward this one , while the other part approaches the n attractor .",
    "this reconstructs the interface in a more advanced position , stabilizes the bands , and increases the contrast between them .",
    "interestingly , there is a spatial position at which @xmath54 and @xmath50 practically remain fixed at their saddle fixed point values . during this stage",
    "@xmath74 is constant ( because it is imposed ) and @xmath78 is almost constant ( because of the compensating evolutions of the two bands ) , so according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : stress ] ) the total stress variation is small , and the characteristic time ( controlled by the i band ) is @xmath79 .",
    "this time exceeds the linear viscoelastic time @xmath2 ( see fig .",

[ f.3]b ) and [ f.4 ] ( the relation between the transmitted intensity and the order parameter is unknown and sure to be non - linear ) , the sharpening of the contrast corresponding to the interface reconstruction is visible .",
    "the difference between the characteristic times for the extinction angle and rheology ( fig.[f.1 ] ) could be due to the different couette cell gap widths .",
    "_ 3 . interface travel_ the instability and reconstruction of the interface in the first two stages is ensured by the reaction terms of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : system ] ) , ending when a sharp interface between stable bands is fully formed .",
    "this interface could have a non - zero velocity if it forms in at a position corresponding to a stress value above or below the plateau stress @xmath81 .",
    "`` front propagation '' over the small distance toward the final equilibrium position is then controlled by @xmath55 ( this distance is too small to observe by birefringence ) . because of the undershoot in the numerical simulation the sign of the displacement during stage 3 is opposite to the one in the first stages ( fig.[f.3]c ) .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath5 for this stage follows from the velocity @xmath82 of the sharp interface close to steady state which is independent of the presence or absence of the undershoot @xcite ( see below ) .",

    "let us consider a single sharp interface , at a position @xmath85 inside the gap .",

    "we consider @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( as in the experiments ) so that @xmath92 ( true for piecewise linear flow curves and obeyed well by the js model ) .",

    "thus , close to this position @xmath96 the equation of motion of the interface is :      using eqs .",

    "in such cases , eq .",
    "( [ eq : drivingf ] ) implies larger stress variations and thus larger interface accelerations for the same position variation .",
