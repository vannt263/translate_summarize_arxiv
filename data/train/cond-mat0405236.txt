    "the superconducting order parameter is also determined within the mean field theory .",
    "then , as in the @xmath18-wave superconductor,@xcite the order parameter @xmath19 is modified in the presence of supercurrent .",
    "we see that the supercurrent first increases linearly with the pair momentum @xmath20 , reaches a maximum value , and drops as @xmath20 is further increased .",
    "we call this maximum value the _ depairing critical current _ in contrast to the usual critical current associated with depinning of vortices and vortex lattices .",

    "the transition is continuous for all @xmath80 in the @xmath5-wave case with in - plane current .",

    "finally , we study the behavior of the supercurrent , which can be evaluated as follows @xmath84,\\ ] ] and reduces to @xmath85 at @xmath68 , where @xmath86 is a constant differing by a factor of @xmath87 between the in - plane and @xmath17-axis cases . solving eq .   for given @xmath18 , and substituting the result into eq .",
    ", we can also evaluate @xmath75 for given @xmath18 . the behavior of the supercurrent as a function of @xmath18 is shown in fig .  [ j0_vs_y ] . for the @xmath5-wave case , an analytic expression for the zero temperature supercurrent and the depairing current @xmath88 ( at which @xmath89 ) have been evaluated in ref .  .",
    "also , the current curves for the @xmath18 and @xmath0-wave cases were numerically evaluated in ref .  .",
    "as expected , for large @xmath18 the equilibrium value of the current is zero since superconductivity is destroyed . for small @xmath18 ,",
    "the current rises linearly , it then reaches a maximum , and finally decreases to zero in the same way as the order parameter .    , given in eq .  .",
    "note that the @xmath86 differs by a factor of @xmath87 between the in - plane and @xmath17-axis cases.[j0_vs_y],width=302 ]    the finite temperature expression for the current becomes @xmath90 the dependence of the depairing current @xmath88 on temperature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ j_max ] .",
    "the behavior of the critical current as a function of temperature is qualitatively similar for all of the considered cases except for the @xmath5-wave sc with current along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "this case is set apart in the same way as when the behavior of the order parameter was considered .",
    "( eq .  ) for given @xmath91.[j_max],width=302 ]",
    "we consider the supercurrent as a simple pair breaking perturbation which adds a doppler shift to the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "while this study is based on the assumption of uniform supercurrent throughout a sample , the experimental realization of uniform current is far from trivial.@xcite in bulk crystals , the supercurrent will be localized near the sample surface due to the meissner effect .",
    "therefore , it is important to have high quality thin films or whiskers of relevant compounds . very recently , whiskers of bi2212 have been used to measure the cross junction josephson tunneling,@xcite which implies that this experiment , while nontrivial , should be possible in the future .",
    "as long as the condition of uniform current is met , the quasiparticle density of states obtained here will be readily accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy and other tunneling techniques . the temperature dependence of the critical depairing current may also be measured .",
    "these measurements will provide useful information on the pairing symmetry of nodal superconductors .",
    "as we have seen , the dos is very sensitive to the symmetry of the gap and the direction of supercurrent . in principle , the dos is sensitive to the location and type of critical points in the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "these critical points are easily perturbed or displaced in different ways by adding to the dispersion an appropriate term linear in electron velocity  the doppler shift .",
    "thus , with the addition of a uniform current , the change in the singularities of the dos can reveal a lot about the symmetry of the unperturbed quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "also , in many cases , the spatially homogeneous configuration as considered here becomes unstable for @xmath76 .",
    "this opens up the possibility of a current induced fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state .",
    "this possibility will be further explored .    in summary",
    ", we have evaluated the effect of the presence of finite supercurrent on the quasiparticle dos of nodal superconductors .",
    "the quasiparticle dos can be probed by tunneling spectroscopy and is sensitive enough to the order parameter and supercurrent direction to help differentiate between superconductors of different gap symmetries .",
    "in addition , we showed the dependence of the supercurrent on the external current and the dependence of the critical depairing current on temperature .",
