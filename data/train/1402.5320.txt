    "one common feature among most of semi - classical approaches to quantum gravity is the departure from the relativistic dispersion relation by redefining the physical momentum or physical energy at the planck scale , or lorentz invariance violation .",
    "the source of this departure comes from many approaches such as spacetime discreteness @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance in string field theory@xcite , spacetime foam models @xcite or spin - network in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite . besides , there are other approaches such as non - commutative geometry @xcite which predicts a lorentz invariance violation .",
    "all these indications suggest that lorentz violation may be an essential property in constructing quantum theory of gravity .",
    "theoretically , the departure from lorentz invariance is expressed in a form of modified dispersion relations ( mdr ) .",
    "mdr could be an indication for threshold anomalies that might occur in ultra - high energy cosmic rays and tev photons @xcite .",
    "modern observatories recently are gaining the sensitivity needed to measure these effects , and should be improved in coming few years .",
    "for a recent detailed review along the mentioned lines can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting class of mdrs , has been suggested in @xcite which in the high - energy regime takes the form :    m^2e^2-^2 + ^2 ( ) ^n [ mdr ] where @xmath0 describes the energy scale at which the dispersion relation is modified and it is taken to be the planck energy , while @xmath1 and @xmath2 represents a free parameters characterizing the deviation from lorentz invariance and @xmath1 indicates how much strongly the magnitude of the deformation that is suppressed by @xmath0 .",
    "this formula is compatible with some of the results obtained in the loop - quantum - gravity approach and reflects some results obtained for theories in @xmath3-minkowski noncommutative spacetime @xcite .",
    "for discussion about phenomenological implications of eq .",
    "( [ mdr ] ) , it is very useful to consult the discussion after eq .",
    "( 13 ) in the detailed review @xcite .",
    "a theory that predict naturally mdr is known as double special relativity ( dsr)@xcite .",
    "dsr is considered as an extension for special theory of relativity and it extends the invariant quantities to be the planck energy scale beside the speed of light .",
    "the simplest realizations of the idea of dsr are based on a non - linear lorentz transformation in momentum space , which imply a deformed lorentz symmetry such that the usual dispersion relations in special relativity may be modified by planck scale corrections .",
    "it should be mentioned that lorentz invariance violation and lorentz invariance deformation are in general conceptually different scenarios .",
    "here we are going to adopt lorentz invariance deformation scenarios by considering dsr and its extension in models of rainbow gravity .    in the framework of dsr",
    "the definition of the dual position space suffers a nonlinearity of the lorentz transformation . to resolve this issue , magueijo and",
    "smolin @xcite proposed a doubly general relativity which assumes that the spacetime background felt by a test particle would depend on its energy .",
    "therefore , there will not be a single metric describing spacetime , but a one parameter family of metrics which depends on the energy ( momentum ) of these test particles , forming a _ rainbow _ of metrics ( i.e rainbow geometry ) .",
    "this approach is known as _ gravity rainbow _ and can be mathematically constructed as follows ; the non - linear of lorentz transformation leads to the following modified dispersion relation e^2 f(e / e_p)^2- p^2 g(e / e_p)^2= m^2 [ rainbowdisper ]    where @xmath0 is the planck energy scale , @xmath4 is the mass of the test particle , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are commonly known as rainbow functions and they satisfy @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    a modified equivalence principle was proposed in @xcite which requires that one parameter family of energy dependent orthonormal frame fields describe a one parameter family of energy dependent metrics given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "but in the limit @xmath12 general relativity must be recovered . with the definition of one parameter family of energy momentum tensors",
    "einstein s equations are also modified as @xmath13 potential investigations on the gravity rainbow can be found in @xcite .    the choice of the rainbow functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 is important for making predictions . among different arbitrary choices in @xcite ,",
    "many aspects of the theory have been studied with schwarzschild metric , black holes , frw universe , and cosmological eras such as inflation and scale invariant fluctuations @xcite . besides , we studied recently the possibility of resolving big bang singularity using gravity rainbow in @xcite . in this letter",
    "we continue our investigation about the effect of gravity rainbow on bh thermodynamics .",
    "we employ the modified dispersion relation of eq.([mdr ] ) @xcite , which fix the rainbow functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 and use these rainbow functions to study the bh thermodynamics and investigate it new properties .",
    "we find that end - point of hawking radiation is not catastrophic anymore in rainbow bh .",
    "we found that an existence of bh remnants at which the specific heat vanishes and , therefore , the bh can not exchange heat with the surrounding space .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section ( [ standard ] ) , we review briefly how standard hawking temperature can be obtained from the schwarzschild metric and show briefly the * _ catastrophic evaporation _ * of bh . in section ( [ rainbow ] ) ,",
    "we investigate bh thermodynamics in gravity rainbow .",
    "we give our conclusions in section ( [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "let us first review briefly the standard hawking radiation process . since hawking temperature is defined in terms of surface gravity @xmath3 @xcite as follows :    t_h= [ hawkingt ] where the surface gravity @xmath3 is defined as @xcite    = _ rr_s where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius . in general relativity",

    "( [ hawt ] ) and substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ sph ] ) , the specific heat could be given by    = -8 g m^2 ,    the hawking temperature @xmath15 can be used in the calculation of the emission rate .",
    "the emission rate might be calculated using stefan - botlzmann law considering the energy loss was dominated by photons .",
    "the emission rate of the bh will be : = -m_p^3  m^-2 , where @xmath16 is the planck time in natural units , and the form of @xmath17 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation should consider the squeezing of the fundamental cell in momentum space , which modify the emission rate equation ( [ rate1 ] ) .",
    "however , one can neglect this effect in the first order approximation @xcite .",
    "the decay time of the bh can be obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ rate1 ] ) to give    = ( ) ^-1m^3  , one notice that the calculated hawking temperature @xmath15 , bekenstein entropy @xmath18 , specific heat @xmath19 , emission rate @xmath20 , and decay time @xmath21 lead to _ * catastrophic evaporation * _ as @xmath22 .",
    "this can be explained as following . since @xmath23 only when @xmath24",
    ", the bh will continue to radiate until @xmath24 .",
    "but as the bh approaches zero mass , its temperature approaches infinity with infinite radiation rate .",
    "this was just a brief summary for the hawking radiation and the catastrophic implications of hawking radiation as the bh mass approaches zero . in the next section ,",
    "we study bh thermodynamics if gravity rainbow is taken into consideration .",
    "now we employe the modified dispersion relation which is proposed by the amelino - camelia , et al . in eq .",

    "( [ hawt ] ) .",
    "it is also clear from eq .",
    "( [ modt ] ) that the modified hawking temperature is physical as far as the bh mass satisfies the following inequality :    m = ^1/n e_p where we have used the natural units which says @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that the black hole should have minimum mass @xmath37 given by m_min=^1/n e_p this point to an existence of _ black hole remnant _ due to gravity rainbow .",
    "we plot in fig.([temperature ] ) the relation between the temperature and bh mass for both cases of standard and rainbow bh .",
    "it is clear that @xmath38 does not blow up as @xmath39 in rainbow bh in the contrary to the standard bh case . in this figure",
    ", we set @xmath40 as an example .",

    "( [ modt ] ) in which the temperature do not suffer any divergence as the mass of the black hole approaches planck scale . on the contrary , the hawking temperature for rainbow bh in eq .",
    "( [ modt ] ) increases as the mass of the black hole decreases until it reaches maximum value , and then decreasing to be zero when the black hole reaches a remnant case at which the black hole can not exchange heat with the surrounding space .",
    "in this work we studied the thermodynamical picture of rainbow black hole .",
    "we found that gravity rainbow may lead to a new mass - temperature relation and define a minimum mass and maximum temperature for rainbow black hole predicting the existence of _ black hole remnant_. we found that the end - point of hawking radiation is not a catastrophic because rainbow functions that are proposed by amelino - camelia , et al . in @xcite",
    "imply the existence of bh remnants at which the specific heat vanishes and , therefore , the bh can not exchange heat with the surrounding space .",
    "the gravity rainbow prevents bhs from evaporating completely , just like the standard uncertainty principle prevents the hydrogen atom from collapsing@xcite .",
    "our result agree with results obtained in the framework of generalized uncertainty principle and black hole physics which also predicted the existence of black hole remnants@xcite .",
    "since remnant of black holes does not possess the horizon , we think that our result may ameliorate information loss problem@xcite . in the future , it would be appropriate to generalize the calculations in extra dimensions to investigate the possibilities to see the remnants of rainbow black holes at lhc .",
