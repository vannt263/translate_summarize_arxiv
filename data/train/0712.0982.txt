    "beside receptor - ligand binding mechanisms , folding and aggregation of proteins belong to the biologically most relevant molecular structure formation processes . while the specific binding between receptors and ligands is not necessarily accompanied by global cooperative structural changes , protein folding and oligomerization of peptides are typically accompanied by conformational transitions  @xcite .",
    "proteins and their aggregates are comparatively small systems . a typical protein consists of a sequence of some hundred amino acids and aggregates are often formed by only a few peptides .",
    "a very prominent example is the extracellular aggregation of the a@xmath0 peptide , which is associated with alzheimer s disease . following the amyloid hypothesis ,",
    "it is believed that these aggregates ( which can also take fibrillar forms ) are neurotoxic , i.e. , they are able to fuse into cell membranes of neurons and open calcium ion channels . it is known that extracellular ca@xmath1 ions intruding into a neuron can promote its degeneration  @xcite .",
    "conformational transitions proteins experience during structuring and aggregation are not phase transitions in the strict thermodynamic sense and their statistical analysis is usually based on studies of signals exposed by energetic and structural fluctuations , as well as system - specific `` order '' parameters . in these studies ,",
    "the temperature @xmath2 is considered as an adjustable , external control parameter and , for the analysis of the pseudophase transitions , the peak structure of quantities such as the specific heat and the fluctuations of the gyration tensor components or `` order '' parameter as functions of the temperature are investigated .",
    "the natural ensemble for this kind of analysis is the canonical ensemble , where the possible states of the system with energies @xmath3 are distributed according to the boltzmann probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "however , phase separation processes of small systems as , e.g. , droplet condensation , are accompanied by surface effects at the interface between the pseudophases  @xcite .",
    "this is reflected by the behavior of the microcanonical entropy @xmath6 , which exhibits a _",
    "monotony in the transition region .",
    "consequences are the backbending of the caloric temperature @xmath7 , i.e. , the _ decrease _ of temperature with increasing system energy , and the negativity of the microcanonical specific heat @xmath8 .",
    "the physical reason is that the free energy balance in phase equilibrium requires the minimization of the interfacial surface and , therefore , the loss of entropy  @xcite . a reduction of the entropy can , however , only be achieved by transferring energy into the system .",
    "recently , we have shown that , employing a minimalistic heteropolymer model , the aggregation of two small peptides is such a phase separation process , where we observed the mentioned peculiar small - system effects  @xcite . here , we consider the aggregation process from the multicanonical , canonical , and microcanonical perspectives .",
    "our results were obtained from multicanonical computer simulations of a mesoscopic hydrophobic - polar heteropolymer model for aggregation , which is based on a simple off - lattice model , originally introduced to study tertiary folding of proteins from a coarse - grained point of view .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : modmet ] , we define the aggregation model employed in our computational study , where we primarily used multicanonical sampling . this method is also briefly described here as well as the aggregation `` order '' parameter needed to discriminate the pseudophases .",
    "section  [ sec : twochain ] is devoted to the main part of the paper : the presentation of the results for the aggregation of two small peptides obtained from multicanonical , canonical , and microcanonical views .",
    "the comparison with results obtained for larger systems is performed in sect .",
    "[ sec : larger ] .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary of the results in sect .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "for our aggregation study on mesoscopic scales , we employ a novel model that is based on a known hydrophobic - polar single - chain approach , originally introduced for heteropolymer chains in two dimensions  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we define this model , describe the simulation methods , and introduce a suitable order parameter that allows for the discrimination of the macrostates or `` pseudophases '' the multiple - chain system can reside in .      for our aggregation study of protein - like heteropolymers",
    ", we assume that the tertiary folding process of the individual chains is governed by hydrophobic - core formation in an aqueous environment . a comparatively simple but powerful model is the ab model  @xcite where only two types of amino acids are considered : hydrophobic residues ( a ) which avoid contact with the polar environment and polar residues ( b ) being favorably attracted by the solvent .",
    "the model is a c@xmath9 type model in that each residue is represented by only a single interaction site ( the `` c@xmath9 atom '' ) .",
    "thus , the natural dihedral torsional degrees of freedom of realistic protein backbones are replaced by virtual bond and torsion angles between consecutive interaction sites .",
    "the large torsional barrier of the peptide bond between neighboring amino acids is in the ab model effectively taken into account by introducing a bending energy . nonbonded residues experience weak pairwise long - range attraction ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairs ) or repulsion ( @xmath12 pairs ) , respectively .",
    "although this coarse - grained picture is obviously not capable to reproduce microscopic properties of specific realistic proteins , it qualitatively exhibits , however , sequence - dependent features known from nature , as , for example , tertiary folding pathways known from two - state folding , folding through intermediates , and metastability  @xcite .    for our systems of more than one chain , we further assume that the interaction strengths between nonbonded residues is independent of the individual properties of the chains the residues belong to . therefore , we use the same parameter sets as in the ab model for the pairwise interactions between residues of different chains .",
    "our aggregation model reads  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 label the @xmath15 polymers interacting with each other , and @xmath16 index the @xmath17 monomers of the respective @xmath18th and @xmath19th polymer .",

    ", we report on results obtained from statistical mechanics studies of the aggregation processes of short polymers .",
    "our primary interest is devoted to the heteropolymer with the sequence s1 : @xmath31 which is a fibonacci sequence  @xcite , whose single - chain properties are already known  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    ", we are going to study the thermodynamics of systems with up to 4 chains of this sequence over the whole energy and temperature regime .",
    "we have used generalized - ensemble markovian monte carlo algorithms to sample the conformational space of the systems studied . the powerful error - weighted multicanonical method  @xcite proved to be particularly useful as it makes it possible to scan the whole phase space with very high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the principle idea is to deform the boltzmann energy distribution @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the density of states with energy @xmath3 and @xmath34 is the thermal energy at temperature @xmath2 , in such a way that the notoriously difficult sampling of the tails is increased and  particularly useful",
    " the sampling rate of the entropically strongly suppressed lowest - energy conformations is improved . in order to achieve this ,",
    "the canonical boltzmann distribution is modified by the multicanonical weight @xmath35 which , in the ideal case , flattens the energy distribution : @xmath36 as the canonical distribution is , of course , not known in the beginning and @xmath37 , the multicanonical weights have to be determined recursively , which can be done in an efficient way  @xcite .",
    "recalling that the simulation temperature @xmath2 does not possess any meaning in the multicanonical ensemble as , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : muca ] ) , the energy distribution is always constant , independently of temperature . actually , it is convenient to set it to infinity in which case @xmath38 and thus @xmath39 .",
    "the latter expression is sometimes parametrized as @xmath40 $ ] , where , for a suitable choice of @xmath41 , @xmath42 can be identified with the microcanonical temperature  @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "conformational changes of the individual chains included spherical updates  @xcite and semilocal crankshaft moves , i.e. , rotations around the axis between the @xmath43th and @xmath44th residue .",
    "a typical multicanonical run contained of the order of @xmath45 single updates .",
    "the polymer chains were embedded into a cubic box with edge lengths @xmath46 and periodic boundary conditions were used . in our simulations ,",
    "the edge lengths of the simulation box were chosen to be @xmath47 which is sufficient to reduce undesired finite - size effects .    for cross - checks",
    "we have also performed replica - exchange ( parallel tempering ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "verifying lowest - energy conformations found in the multicanonical simulations , we have also performed optimization runs using the energy - landscape paving ( elp ) method  @xcite .      in order to distinguish between the fragmented and the aggregated regime ,",
    "we introduce the `` order '' parameter @xmath48 where the summations are taken over the minimum distances @xmath49 of the respective centers of mass of the chains ( or their periodic continuations ) . the center of mass of the @xmath18th chain in a box with periodic boundary conditions is defined as @xmath50/n_\\mu$ ] , where @xmath51 is the coordinate vector of the first monomer and serves as a reference coordinate in a local coordinate system .",
    "our aggregation parameter is to be considered as a qualitative measure ; roughly , fragmentation corresponds to large values of @xmath52 , aggregation requires the centers of masses to be in close distance in which case @xmath52 is comparatively small . despite its qualitative nature , it turns out to be a surprisingly manifest indicator for the aggregation transition and allows even a clear discrimination of different aggregation pathways , as will be seen later on .    according to the boltzmann distribution  ( [ eq : can ] ) , we define canonical expectation values of any observable @xmath53 by @xmath54o(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\ } ) e^{-e(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\})/k_bt},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the canonical partition function @xmath55 is given by @xmath56e^{-e(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\})/k_bt}.\\ ] ] formally , the integrations are performed over all possible conformations @xmath57 of the @xmath15 chains .    similarly to the specific heat per monomer @xmath58",
    "( with @xmath59 ) which expresses the thermal fluctuations of energy , the temperature derivative of @xmath60 per monomer , @xmath61 , is a useful indicator for cooperative behavior of the multiple - chain system . since the system size is small  the number of monomers @xmath62 as well as the number of chains @xmath15  aggregation transitions , if any , are expected to be signalized by the peak structure of the fluctuating quantities as functions of the temperature .",
    "this requires the temperature to be a unique external control parameter which is a natural choice in the canonical statistical ensemble .",
    "furthermore , this is a typically easily adjustable and , therefore , convenient parameter in experiments .",
    "as we have stressed recently  @xcite , however , aggregation is a phase separation process and , since the system is small , there is no uniform mapping between temperature and energy . for this reason ,",
    "the total system energy is the more appropriate external parameter .",
    "thus , the microcanonical interpretation will turn out to be the more favorable description , at least in the transition region .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in the following section .",
    "for the qualitative description of the aggregation and the accompanied conformational cooperativity within the whole system , it is sufficient to consider a very small system which is computationally reliably tractable and nonetheless yields precise results for all energies and temperatures .",
    "our heteropolymer system consists of two identical chains with the amino acid composition s1 and will be denoted as 2@xmath63s1 . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the aggregation behavior of this system from the multicanonical , the canonical , and the microcanonical point of view .      in a multicanonical simulation ,",
    "the phase space is sampled in such a way that the energy distribution gets as flat as possible .",
    "thermodynamically , this means that the sampling of the phase space is performed for all temperatures within a single simulation  @xcite . the desired information for the thermodynamic behavior of the system at a certain temperature is then obtained by simply reweighting the multicanonical into the respective canonical distribution , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : muca ] ) . since the multicanonical ensemble contains all thermodynamic informations , including the conformational transitions , it is quite useful to measure within the simulation the multicanonical histogram @xmath64 where @xmath65 labels the monte carlo `` time '' steps .",
    "more formally , this distribution can be expressed as a conformation - space integral @xmath66   \\delta(e(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\}-e_0)\\delta(\\gamma(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\}-\\gamma_0)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times e^{-{\\cal h}_{\\rm muca}(e(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\}))/k_bt } \\propto e^{-{\\cal f}_{\\rm muca}(e_0,\\gamma_0)/k_bt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the multicanonical energy @xmath67 which is independent of temperature .",
    "the multicanonical partition function is also trivially a constant in temperature , @xmath68 e^{-{\\cal h}_{\\rm muca}(e(\\{{\\bf x}_\\mu\\}))/k_bt}=\\text{const}_t.\\ ] ] it is obvious that integrating @xmath69 over @xmath52 recovers the uniform multicanonical energy distribution : @xmath70 the canonical distribution of energy and @xmath52 parameter at temperature @xmath2 can be retained , similar to inverting eq .",
    "( [ eq : muca ] ) , by performing the simple reweighting @xmath71 which is , due to the restriction to a certain temperature , less favorable to gain an overall impression of the phase behavior ( i.e. , the transition pathway ) of the system , compared to the multicanonical analog @xmath69 .",
    "= 8.8 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mucahist](a ) , @xmath69 is shown for the two - peptide system 2@xmath63s1 as a color - coded projection onto the @xmath3-@xmath52 plane , which is the direct output obtained in the multicanonical simulation .",
    "qualitatively , we observe two separate main branches ( which are `` channels '' in the corresponding free - energy landscape ) , between which a noticeable transition occurs . in the vicinity of the energy @xmath72 , both channels overlap , i.e. , the associated macrostates coexist .",
    "since @xmath52 is an effective measure for the spatial distance between the two peptides , it is obvious that conformations with separated or fragmented peptides belong to the dominating channel in the regime of high energies and large @xmath52 values , whereas the aggregates are accumulated in the narrow low - energy and small-@xmath52 channel .",
    "thus , the main observation from the multicanonical , comprising point of view is that the aggregation transition is a phase - separation process which , even for this small system , already appears in a surprisingly clear fashion .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the high precision of the multicanonical method allows us even to reveal further details in the lowest - energy aggregation regime , which is usually a notoriously difficult sampling problem .",
    "figure  [ fig : mucahist](b ) shows that the tight aggregation channel splits into three separate , almost degenerate subchannels at lowest energies . from the analysis of the conformations in this region",
    ", we find that representative conformations with smallest @xmath52 values , @xmath73 , are typically entangled , while those with @xmath74 have a spherically - capped shape .",

    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confs ] .",
    "the also highly compact conformations belonging to the intermediate subphase do not exhibit such characteristic features and are rather globules without noticeable internal symmetries . in all cases ,",
    "the aggregates contain a single compact core of hydrophobic residues .",
    "thus , the aggregation is not a simple docking process of two prefolded peptides , but a complex cooperative folding - binding process .",
    "this is a consequence of the energetically favored hydrophobic inter - residue contacts which , as the results show , overcompensate the entropic steric constraints .",
    "the story is , however , even more interesting , as also nonnegligible surface effects come into play .",
    "after the following standard canonical analysis , this will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent microcanonical interpretation of our results .",
    "phase transitions are typically described in the canonical ensemble with the temperature kept fixed .",
    "this is also natural from an experimentalist s point of view , since the temperature is a convenient external control parameter .",
    "the macrostates are weighted according to the boltzmann distribution  ( [ eq : can ] ) .",
    "a nice feature of the canonical ensemble is that the temperature dependence of fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities is usually a very useful indicator for phase or pseudophase transitions .",
    "this cooperative thermodynamic activity is typically signalized by peaks or , in the thermodynamic limit ( if it exists ) , by divergences of these fluctuations .",
    "even for small systems , peak temperatures can frequently be identified with transition temperatures .",
    "although in these cases peak temperatures typically depend on the fluctuating quantities considered , in most cases associated pseudophase transitions are doubtlessly manifest . in such cases ,",
    "the transition ranges over an extended temperature interval , as , e.g. , in the folding process of proteins or heteropolymers  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : canon2x13.1](b ) , the temperature dependence of the mean aggregation order parameter @xmath77 and the fluctuations of @xmath52 are shown .",
    "the aggregation transition is signalized by very sharp peaks and from both figures we read off peak temperatures close to @xmath78 .",
    "the aggregation of the two peptides is a single - step process , in which the formation of the aggregate with a common compact hydrophobic core governs the folding behavior of the individual chains . folding and binding",
    "are not separate processes .",
    "the dominance of the inter - chain binding interaction can also be seen by considering the lowest - energy conformation found in our simulations . the energy of this conformation , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsconf ] , is @xmath79 in our energy units . the peptide - peptide binding energy [ i.e. , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aggmod ] ) ] is with @xmath80 much stronger than the intrinsic single - chain energies @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the single - chain minimum energy is with @xmath83  @xcite noticeably smaller .",
    "= 3.3 cm    the comparatively strong inter - chain interaction and the strength of the aggregation transition despite the smallness of the system lead to the conclusion that surface effects are of essential importance for the aggregation of the peptides .",
    "this is actually confirmed by a detailed microcanonical analysis which is performed in the next subsection .      in the microcanonical analysis ,",
    "the system energy @xmath3 is kept ( almost ) fixed and treated as an external control parameter .",
    "the system can only take macrostates with energies in the interval @xmath84 with @xmath85 being sufficiently small to satisfy @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the phase space volume of this energetic shell . in the limit @xmath88 , the total phase space volume up to the energy @xmath3",
    "can thus be expressed as @xmath89 since @xmath33 is positive for all @xmath3 , @xmath90 is a monotonically increasing function and this quantity is suitably related to the microcanonical entropy @xmath6 of the system . in the definition of hertz , @xmath91 alternatively , the entropy is often directly related to the density of states @xmath33 and defined as @xmath92 the density of states exhibits a decrease much faster than exponential towards the low - energy states .",
    "for this reason , the phase - space volume at energy @xmath3 is strongly dominated by the number of states in the energy shell @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath93 is directly related to the density of states .",
    "this virtual identity breaks down in the higher - energy region , where @xmath94 is getting flat   in our case far above the energetic regions being relevant for the discussion of the aggregation transition ( i.e. , for energies @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] ) . actually , both definitions of the entropy led in our study to virtually identical results in the analysis of the aggregation transition  @xcite .",
    "the ( reciprocal ) slope of the microcanonical entropy fixes the temperature scale and the corresponding caloric temperature is then defined via @xmath96 for fixed volume @xmath97 and particle number @xmath62 .",
    "as long as the mapping between the caloric temperature @xmath2 and the system energy @xmath3 is bijective , the canonical analysis of crossover and phase transitions is suitable since the temperature can be treated as external control parameter . for systems , where this condition is not satisfied , however",
    ", in a standard canonical analysis one may easily miss a physical effect accompanying condensation processes : due to surface effects ( the formation of the contact surface between the peptides requires a rearrangement of monomers in the surfaces of the individual peptides ) , additional energy does not necessarily lead to an increase of temperature of the condensate .",
    "actually , the aggregate can even become colder .",
    "the supply of additional energy supports the fragmentation of parts of the aggregate , but this is overcompensated by cooperative processes of the particles aiming to reduce the surface tension .",
    "condensation processes are phase - separation processes and as such aggregated and fragmented phases coexist . since in this phase - separation region @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not bijective , this phenomenon is called the `` backbending effect '' . the probably most important class of systems exhibiting this effect is characterized by their smallness and the capability to form aggregates , depending on the interaction range . the fact that this effect could be indirectly observed in sodium clustering experiments",
    "@xcite gives rise to the hope that backbending could also be observed in aggregation processes of small peptides .",
    "= 8.8 cm    since the 2@xmath63s1 system apparently belongs to this class , the backbending effect is also observed in the aggregation / fragmentation transition of this system .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] , where the microcanonical entropy @xmath6 is plotted as function of the system energy .",
    "the phase - separation region of aggregated and fragmented conformations lies between @xmath98 and @xmath99 . constructing the concave gibbs hull @xmath100 by linearly connecting @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( straight dashed line in fig .",

    "the deviation is maximal for @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the surface entropy .",
    "the gibbs hull also defines the aggregation transition temperature @xmath106 for the 2@xmath63s1 system , we find @xmath107 , which is virtually identical with the peak temperatures of the fluctuating quantities discussed in sect .  [",

    "different energetic macrostates coexist .",
    "this is a consequence of the backbending effect . within the backbending region ,",
    "the temperature decreases with increasing system energy .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath112 is the maxwell construction , i.e. , the slope of the gibbs hull @xmath100 .",
    "although the transition seems to have similarities with the van der waals description of the condensation / evaporation transition of gases   the `` overheating '' of the aggregate between @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( within the energy interval @xmath115 ) is as apparent as the `` undercooling '' of the fragments between @xmath116 and @xmath113 ( in the energy interval @xmath117 )   it is important to notice that in contrast to the van der waals picture the backbending effect in - between is a real physical effect .",
    "another essential result is that in the transition region the temperature is not a suitable external control parameter : the macrostate of the system can not be adjusted by fixing the temperature .",
    "the better choice is the system energy which is unfortunately difficult to control in experiments .",
    "another direct consequence of the energetic ambiguity for a fixed temperature between @xmath116 and @xmath114 is that the canonical interpretation is not suitable for detecting the backbending phenomenon .",
    "it should also be noted that in this region , the microcanonical specific heat @xmath118 can become negative  @xcite , which is a remarkable , but somehow `` exotic '' side effect .",
    "the precise microcanonical analysis reveals also a further detail of the aggregation transition .",
    "close to @xmath119 , the @xmath120 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] exhibits another `` backbending '' which signalizes a second , but unstable transition of the same type .",
    "the associated transition temperature @xmath121 is smaller than @xmath113 , but this transition occurs in the energetic region where fragmented states dominate . thus this transition can be interpreted as the premelting of aggregates by forming intermediate states .",
    "these intermediate structures are rather weakly stable : the population of the premolten aggregates never dominates .",
    "in particular , at @xmath122 , where premolten aggregates and fragments coexist , the population of compact aggregates is much larger .",
    "this can nicely be seen in the canonical energy histograms at these temperatures plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : canhist ] , where the second backbending is only signalized by a small cusp in the coexistence region .",

    "obviously , the energy required to melt the premolten aggregate is much smaller than to dissolve a compact ( solid ) aggregate .",
    "= 8.8 cm    for the comparison of the surface entropies , we use the definition  ( [ eq : ent ] ) of the entropy . in the case of the aggregation transition ,",
    "the surface entropy is @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the concave gibbs hull of @xmath127 . since @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the surface entropy is @xmath130 yet utilizing that the canonical distribution @xmath131 at @xmath113 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : canhist ] is @xmath132 , the surface entropy can be written in the simple and computationally convenient form  @xcite : @xmath133 a similar expression is valid for the coexistence of premolten and fragmented states at @xmath122 the corresponding canonical distribution is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : canhist ] .",
    "thus , we obtain ( in units of @xmath5 ) for the surface entropy of the aggregation transition @xmath134 and for the premelting @xmath135 , confirming the weakness of the interface between premolten aggregates and fragmented states .",
    "in order to verify the general validity of the statements in the previous section for the 2@xmath63s1 system , we have also performed simulations of systems consisting of three ( in the following referred to as 3@xmath63s1 ) and four ( 4@xmath63s1 ) identical peptides with sequence s1 .",
    "although the formation of compact hydrophobic cores is more complex in larger compounds of our exemplified sequence s1 , the aggregation transition is little influenced by this .",

    "this influences primarily the entropy in the high - energy regime far above the aggregation transition energy .",
    "nonetheless , in the canonical interpretation , it acts back onto the transition as undesired states ( chain ends overlapping due to the periodic boundary conditions ) are ( weakly ) populated at the transition temperature , whereas others are suppressed .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the box size dependence ( results not shown ) and found that the canonical transition temperature scales slightly , but noticeably with the box size .",

    "there are also for the larger systems no obvious signals for separate aggregation and hydrophobic - core formation processes .",
    "only weak activity in the energy fluctuations in the temperature region below the aggregation transition temperature indicates that local restructuring processes of little cooperativity ( comparable with the discussion of the premolten aggregates in the discussion of the 2@xmath63s1 system ) are still happening .",
    "the strength of the aggregation transition is also documented by the fact that the peak temperatures of energetic _ and _ aggregation parameter fluctuations are virtually identical for the 3@xmath63s1 system , i.e. , the aggregation temperature is @xmath136 ( for 4@xmath63s1 @xmath137 ) .",

    "[ fig : ent234 ] , the microcanonical entropies per monomer @xmath142 ( shifted by an unimportant constant for clearer visibility ) and the corresponding gibbs hulls @xmath143 are shown for 2@xmath63s1 ( in the figure denoted by `` 2 '' ) , 3@xmath63s1 ( `` 3 '' ) , and 4@xmath63s1 ( `` 4 '' ) , respectively , as functions of the energy per monomer @xmath144 .",
    "although the convex entropic `` intruder '' is apparent for larger systems as well , its relative strength decreases with increasing number of chains .",
    "the slopes of the respective gibbs constructions determine the aggregation temperature  ( [ eq : tagg ] ) which are found to be @xmath145 and @xmath146 confirming the peak temperatures of the fluctuation quantities plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : canon3_4x13.1 ] .",
    "the existence of the interfacial boundary entails a transition barrier whose strength is characterized by the surface entropy @xmath147 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent234 ] , the individual entropic deviations per monomer , @xmath148 are also shown and the maximum deviations , i.e. , the surface entropies @xmath147 and relative surface entropies per monomer @xmath149 are listed in table  [ tab : lsys ] .",
    "there is no apparent difference between the values of @xmath147 that would indicate a trend for a vanishing of the _ absolute _ surface barrier in larger systems .",
    "however , the _ relative _ surface entropy @xmath150 obviously decreases . whether or not it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit",
    "can not be decided from our results and is a study worth in its own right .",
    ".[tab : lsys ] aggregation temperatures @xmath113 , surface entropies @xmath147 , relative surface entropies per monomer @xmath150 , relative aggregation and fragmentation energies per monomer , @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively , latent heat per monomer @xmath153 , and phase - separation entropy per monomer @xmath154 .",
    "all quantities for systems consisting of two , three , and four 13mers with ab sequence s1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is also interesting that subleading effects increase and the double - well form found for 2@xmath63s1 changes by higher - order effects , and it seems that for larger systems the almost single - step aggregation of 2@xmath63s1 is replaced by a multiple - step process .",
    "not surprisingly , the fragmented phase is hardly influenced by side effects and the rightmost minimum in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent234 ] lies well at @xmath155 .",
    "since the gibbs construction covers the whole convex region of @xmath156 , the aggregation energy per monomer @xmath157 corresponds to the leftmost minimum and its value changes noticeably with the number of chains . in consequence ,",
    "the latent heat per monomer @xmath158/n_{\\rm tot}$ ] that is required to fragment the aggregate increases from two to four chains in the system ( see table  [ tab : lsys ] ) .",
    "although the systems under consideration are too small to extrapolate phase transition properties in the thermodynamic limit , it is obvious that the aggregation - fragmentation transition exhibits strong similarities to condensation - evaporation transitions of colloidal systems . given that , the entropic transition barrier @xmath154 , which we see increasing with the number of chains ( cf .",
    "the values in table  [ tab : lsys ] ) , would survive in the thermodynamic limit and the transition was first - order - like .",
    "more surprising would be , however , if the convex intruder would not disappear , i.e. , if the absolute and relative surface entropies @xmath147 and @xmath150 do not vanish .",
    "this is definitely a question of fundamental interest as the common claim is that pure surface effects typically exhibited only by `` small '' systems are irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this requires , however , studies of much larger systems .",
    "it should clearly be noted , however , that protein aggregates forming themselves in biological systems often consist only of a few peptides and are definitely of small size and the surface effects are responsible for structure formation and are not unimportant side effects .",
    "one should keep in mind that standard thermodynamics and the thermodynamic limit are somewhat theoretical constructs valid only for very large systems .",
    "the increasing interest in physical properties of small systems , in particular in conformational transitions in molecular systems , requires in part a revision of dogmatic thermodynamic views .",
    "indeed , by means of today s chemo - analytical and experimental equipment , effects like those described throughout the paper , should actually experimentally be verifiable as these are real physical effects . for studies of the condensation of atoms , where a similar behavior occurs",
    ", such experiments have actually already been performed  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the microcanonical analysis of the aggregation of an exemplified two - peptide system  @xcite by interpreting the results from the multicanonical and the canonical perspective as well .",
    "in addition , these results are compared with aggregation properties of larger systems consisting of three and four peptides , each of which with the same sequence . from the conventional canonical analysis of statistical fluctuations of energy and a suitably chosen `` order '' parameter  the root mean square distance of the centers of masses of the individual polymers  we obtain the typical small - system indications of a thermodynamic phase transition : sharp peaks in the specific heat and in the order parameter fluctuations at almost the same temperature signalize a strong transition , which we clearly identify as the aggregation transition . for all systems considered ,",
    "the general behavior is similar .",
    "there is only this single transition which also indicates that conformational changes of the polymers accompany the aggregation process and are not separate transitions .",
    "we expect that this coincidence is sequence - dependent and a comparison between different sequences is a study in its own right . at least for the semiflexible homopolymer of same size which in our notation would have the sequence @xmath159 ( or also @xmath160 ) , we find that aggregation and collapse are separate processes  @xcite .",
    "a quite remarkable result of the exemplified heteropolymer study presented in this paper is that the aggregation process of a small number of peptides is a phase - separation process , where interfacial surface effects entail a loss of entropy .",
    "this loss must be compensated by additional energy delivered to the system . in consequence ,",
    "the caloric temperature decreases , i.e. , the aggregate is getting colder although its total energy increases .",
    "this is known as the temperature `` backbending '' which is a real thermodynamic effect and not an artefact of the theory . in the systems considered throughout the paper ,",
    "the relative influence of the surface effects seems to decrease with the number of chains in the system .",
    "since the length of the peptides is fixed by their hydrophobic - polar monomer composition , a thermodynamic limit towards infinite chain lengths is , however , not existing .",
    "it is just the smallness of such molecular systems that allow these to trigger biological interchange processes which are inevitably connected with conformational activity .",
