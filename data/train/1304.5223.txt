    "recall that for any algebra @xmath413 , we denote by @xmath414 as the set of simple @xmath413-modules , and we will always identify sms s with configurations .    our plan to prove theorem [ thm - main ] is to first show that it holds ( i.e. @xmath6 is a bijection ) for the case @xmath415 , then extends to @xmath7 with @xmath23 .",
    "afterwards , we show @xmath6 is surjective non - injective for other cases of @xmath7 .",

    "mutation preserving property is inherited from the composition of mutation preserving maps @xmath427 and @xmath428 .",
    "this is by combining the following lemmas [ lem - frakf - well - def ] , [ lem - frakf - surj ] , [ lem - frakf - inj ] .      for each @xmath420 , by proposition [ thm-2tiltalgo ]",

    "[ prop - szrs ] for each brauer tree @xmath88 with @xmath108 edges and multiplicity @xmath178 , there is a pair of two - term tilting complexes @xmath446 such that @xmath447 . in particular , @xmath448 are sujective .    as remarked in (",
    "* example 1 ) , one can put extra combinatorial data on @xmath88 resulting in so called brauer tree with completely folded pointing , then using main theorem of @xcite to construct a two - term tilting complex concentrated in degree 0 and 1 with stalk summands concentrated in degree 0 .",
    "so we can just shift this complex to obtain @xmath449 . to get @xmath450 one uses the dual pointing of completely folded pointing ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example1 ) ) and apply schaps - zakay - illouz correspondence , but without shifting this time .      the statement follows by observeing closely the construction and proof of main theorem of @xcite . to be slightly more precisely , two - term tilting complex @xmath10 with @xmath373 corresponds to a completely folded pointing ( or its dual ) brauer tree with a choice of non - exceptional vertex .",
    "changing this choice corresponds to cyclically permuting the label of projective indecomposable modules in the components of @xmath10 .",
    "again , we prove only for @xmath432 , the other case is analogous .",
    "the first statement follows from previous lemma [ lem - permute - label ] , as changing labelling of projective modules in @xmath10 corresponds to changing the @xmath137-coordinate of the configuration corresponding to @xmath460 .    since every sms of @xmath1 is simple - image , we have @xmath461 for some brauer tree @xmath88 and stable equivalence @xmath462 . by proposition [ prop - szrs ] ,",
    "we can find a @xmath463 with @xmath464 .",
    "let @xmath465 , so @xmath466 can be obtained from @xmath54 by a stable auto - equivalence .",
    "recall from @xcite that any stable auto - equivalence of self - injective nakayama algebra is generated by the its picard group and @xmath127 , hence @xmath467 for some @xmath196 . since @xmath466 and @xmath54 are of the same type by lemma [ lem - frakf - well - def ] , @xmath468 .",
    "surjectivity of @xmath457 now follows .",
    "we prove only for the minus version .",
    "suppose @xmath469 with @xmath470 .",
    "this implies @xmath471 , or equivalently @xmath472 . by lemma [ lem - permute - label ] , we have @xmath10 is given by permuting labels of components of @xmath473 . as in previous lemma [ lem - frakf - surj ] , this implies @xmath474 for some @xmath196 .",
    "hence @xmath466 is @xmath475-stable . but",
    "this means that the corresponding permutation on the labels on projective modules in @xmath473 only permutes the summands of @xmath473 .",
    "hence @xmath476 .",
    "recall that there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath25 and @xmath481 , as they can both be identified as @xmath165-stable configurations of @xmath482 .",
    "note that @xmath254 is just brauer star algebra @xmath217 with @xmath483 .",
    "this correspondence respects mutations , in the sense that an irreducible mutation of sms in @xmath481 corresponds to an irreducible ( nakayama - stable ) mutation of sms in @xmath481 ( see remark [ rmk - covering - theory ] ) . also , the bijections @xmath484 are also mutation preserving ( theorem [ thm - sinakayama-2tilt ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have composition of mutation preserving maps @xmath485 and all the maps are bijective",
    ". the theorem follows .",
    "we have @xmath494 with all the left - to - right maps preserving mutations by theorem [ thm - sinakayama-2tilt ] , theorem [ thm - main - btree ] , lemma [ lem - mutatesimples - multi - free ] , remark [ rmk - covering - theory ] .",
    "take canonical stalk tilting complex @xmath254 , it is easy to see that this maps to @xmath495 along the composition of maps in ( [ eqn - compose - mutation - resp - maps ] ) . since all self - injective nakayama algebras are ( strongly left ) tilting - connected and the composition ( [ eqn - compose - mutation - resp - maps ] ) respects mutation , this implies that the composition ( [ eqn - compose - mutation - resp - maps ] ) is precisely @xmath6 .",
    "now it remains to show that @xmath496 is not injective . since @xmath224 bijects with @xmath497 , by (",
    "* cor 2.24 ) , @xmath498 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath225 bijects with the set of @xmath499-stable configurations of @xmath500 , which is the same as the set of configurations of @xmath500 . hence @xmath225 bijects with non - crossing partitions of type @xmath501 , for which cardinality is well - known , namely the catalan number @xmath502 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
