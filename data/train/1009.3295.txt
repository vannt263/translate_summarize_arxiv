    "moreover , orientation of the one - manifold at the endpoints must match the signs in the sequences @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "for instance , the diagram    is a morphism from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "a diagram without endpoints is an endomorphism of @xmath18 .",
    "composition of morphisms is given by concatenating the diagrams .",
    "the sequence of @xmath66 pluses is denoted @xmath87 , the sequence of @xmath66 minuses @xmath88 .    we have the heisenberg relation @xmath89 this isomorphism is canonical and comes from the maps between these objects encoded in the following diagram    @xmath90    the four arrows are given by four morphisms , two of which are crossings and two are u - turns .",
    "the condition that these maps describe a decomposition of @xmath86 as the direct sum of objects @xmath86 and @xmath18 is equivalent to relations ( [ eq - mainrels1 ] ) and ( [ eq - mainrels3 ] ) , modulo the condition that an isotopy of a diagram does not change the morphism .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to the biadjointness of functors of tensoring with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with the biadjointness transformations given by the four @xmath91-turns    ( see section  [ subsec - biadjoint ] for details ) .    moving the lower endpoints of a diagram up via a multiple cups diagram leads to canonical isomorphisms @xmath92 related to the biadjointness of tensoring with @xmath93 and @xmath94 . here",
    "@xmath95 is the sequence @xmath72 with the order and all signs reversed .",
    "biadjointness natural transformations satisfy the cyclicity condition  @xcite , which follows at once from the definition of @xmath6 .    the two relations in ( [ eq - mainrels1 ] ) allow simplification of a double crossing for oppositely oriented intervals . the first relation in ( [ eq - mainrels3 ] ) says that a counterclockwise oriented circle equals one .",
    "thus , an innermost counterclockwise circle can be erased from the diagram without changing the value of the diagram viewed as an element of the hom space between the functors .",
    "there are two possible types of curls on strands : a left curl @xmath96 and a right curl @xmath97 the second relation in ( [ eq - mainrels3 ] ) says that a diagram that contains a left curl subdiagram is zero .",
    "defining local relations in @xmath6 imply the following relations    , .",
    "the second relation , jointly with the original ones , implies that the triple intersection move holds for any orientation of the 3 strands :    furthermore , right curls can be moved across intersection points , modulo simpler diagrams :    it will be convenient to denote a right curl by a dot on a strand , and @xmath63-th power of a right curl by a dot with @xmath63 next to it :    the above relations can be rewritten as    together with the earlier ones , these relations show that there is a homomorphism from the degenerate affine hecke algebra @xmath98 with coefficients in @xmath9 to the @xmath9-algebra of endomorphisms of the object @xmath99 . the permutation generator @xmath100 of @xmath98 goes to the permutation diagram of the @xmath3-th and @xmath101-st strands , and the polynomial generator @xmath102 goes to the dot on the @xmath3-th strand :    note that @xmath103 indeed , the figure eight diagram , for any orientation , contains both left and right curls , and , therefore , equals to zero in our calculus .",
    "a strand with @xmath63 dots can be closed into either a clockwise - oriented or a counterclockwise - oriented circle with @xmath63 dots .",
    "denote these circles by @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively :    @xmath106    counterclockwise circles can be expressed as linear combinations of products of clockwise circles .",
    "for the first few values of @xmath63 , these are    @xmath107    these equations are obtained by expanding each dot into a left curl and then operating on the resulting diagram via the rules of the graphical calculus .",
    "a counterclockwise circle with one dot expands into the figure eight diagram , which is @xmath10 . for another example ,    @xmath108    for @xmath109 we have @xmath110    _ proof _ is the following computation :    in the second equality , we converted a dot to a right curl , and , in the third equality , moved @xmath63 dots through a crossing .",
    "the first term on the second line equals @xmath10 , since it contains a left curl .",
    "iterating this formula , one obtains an expession for @xmath105 as a polynomial function of @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "vice versa , each @xmath112 can be written as a polynomial in @xmath114 @xmath115 .",

    "namely , any diagram representing an endomorphism of @xmath125 is a combination of diagrams that consist of a permutation @xmath130 , some number ( possibly zero ) of dots on each strand above the permutation diagram , and a monomial in dotted clockwise circles to the right :    we write these basis elements as @xmath131 in the above example , the element is @xmath132    surjectivity of @xmath129 can be strengthened to the following result .",
