    "the study of charmonium production in hadronic collisions is an interesting test of our understanding of the physics of strong interactions .",
    "while the production of the @xmath3 pair can be addressed in a perturbative - qcd approach , the subsequent binding of the pair is an essentially non - perturbative process , involving soft partons and occurring on a rather long timescale ( @xmath4 fm / c ) .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been proposed ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) , but a satisfactory description of j/@xmath0  production in collisions is still missing  @xcite . in interactions , the heavy - quark pair is created in the nuclear medium , and the study of its evolution towards a bound state can add significant constraints to the models .",
    "for example , the strength of the interaction between the evolving @xmath3 pair and the target nucleons , that can lead to a break - up of the pair and consequently to a suppression of the j/@xmath0  yield , may depend on its quantum state at the production level ( color - octet or color - singlet ) , and on the kinematic variables of the pair  @xcite .",
    "in addition to final - state effects , also initial - state effects may influence the observed j/@xmath0  yield in . in particular , parton shadowing in the target nucleus  @xcite may suppress ( or enhance , in the case of anti - shadowing ) the probability of producing a j/@xmath0 , while the energy loss of the incident parton  @xcite in the nuclear medium , prior to @xmath3 production , may significantly alter the j/@xmath0  cross section and kinematic distributions .",
    "furthermore , effects as final - state energy loss and the presence of an intrinsic charm component in the proton may also play a significant role  @xcite . clearly , the correct understanding and the disentangling of the various nucleus - related effects on j/@xmath0  production is a non - trivial task , which poses significant challenges to theory , but at the same time offers important insights on the j/@xmath0  production and interaction mechanisms . finally , a suppression of the j/@xmath0  has been proposed a long time ago as a signature of the formation , in ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , of a state where quarks and gluons are deconfined ( quark - gluon plasma )  @xcite .",
    "results from collisions , taken in the same kinematic conditions of , and properly extrapolated to nucleus - nucleus collisions , are therefore necessary to calibrate the contribution of the various cold nuclear matter effects to the overall observed suppression  @xcite .    having to deal with a rather complicated interplay of various physical processes , the availability of accurate sets of data , spanning large intervals in the incident proton energy , and covering large @xmath5 and @xmath6 regions , is essential for a thorough understanding of the involved mechanisms . at fixed target energies , high - statistics j/@xmath0",
    "samples have been collected in recent years by the desy experiment hera - b  @xcite , at 920 gev incident energy , by e866  @xcite at fnal at 800 gev , and by the cern - sps experiment na50 at 400 and 450 gev  @xcite .    in this letter , we present an extension of these measurements towards lower energies , carried out by the na60 experiment  @xcite .",
    "j/@xmath0  production has been studied in collisions at 158 gev , the same energy used in collisions at the cern sps .",
    "data have also been taken with a 400 gev beam , in order to provide a result that can be compared with previous sets of data taken by the na50 experiment  @xcite .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of nuclear effects by analyzing the @xmath7dependence of the j/@xmath0  production cross section on seven different target nuclei ( be , al , cu , in , w , pb and u ) .",
    "the results are relative to a region close to midrapidity , and are presented differentially in @xmath8 and @xmath2 and compared with previous results from the higher-@xmath9 measurements mentioned above .",
    "the influence of parton shadowing in the nuclear targets on the results is also discussed , based on various recent parametrizations of this effect  @xcite . a comparison between our results at the two energies as a function of @xmath2 ,",
    "the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the parton in the nuclear target that produces the j/@xmath0 , is carried out . by doing so",
    ", the shadowing effects can be factorized and the importance of the other nuclear effects can be investigated .",
    "the na60 experiment has measured muon pair production in and collisions at the cern sps .",
    "its experimental apparatus was based on a muon spectrometer ( ms ) , positioned downstream of a hadron absorber with a total thickness of 12 nuclear interaction lengths ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the ms is coupled to a vertex spectrometer ( vt ) based on si pixel detectors . the experiment triggered on muon pairs detected in the ms , which were then matched , during reconstruction , to the corresponding tracks in the vt . for details on the detector set - up and matching between the ms and",
    "vt we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the j/@xmath0  mesons have been identified through their decay to a muon pair . in the data taking",
    ", the sps proton beam , with an average intensity of 5@xmath1110@xmath12 s@xmath13 , was hitting a target system composed of nine sub - targets with thicknesses between 0.005 and 0.012 @xmath10 , with relative spacing between targets from 0.8 to 1 cm . to limit the possible influence of position - dependent systematic effects on the measurement of the nuclear dependence of the j/@xmath0  yield",
    ", the subtargets were placed in a mixed - a order , namely al , u , w , cu , in , be , be , be and pb .",
    "the analysis described in this letter has been carried out on a data sample consisting of 2.8@xmath1110@xmath14 events at 158 gev , and 1.5@xmath1110@xmath14 events at 400 gev , containing a dimuon reconstructed in the ms .",
    "the mass region m@xmath152.85 gev / c@xmath16 , dominated by j/@xmath0   decays , contains 3.2@xmath1110@xmath17 and 2.1@xmath1110@xmath17 events at 158 and 400 gev , respectively . for about 50% of these events ,",
    "each of the two ms tracks can be matched in direction and momentum with a track in the vt .",
    "such a value of the dimuon matching efficiency is due the smaller solid angle coverage of the vt with respect to the ms and to the inefficiency of the pixel sensors as will be discussed below .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation has shown that the contamination from events where at least one of the ms tracks is matched to a wrong vt track is negligible in the j/@xmath0  mass region .    for events containing a pair of hard muons from the decay of a j/@xmath0   ( the average muon momentum is 27 gev / c ) , the point of closest approach of the two muons gives an accurate estimate of their production point , with a resolution of @xmath18 650 @xmath19 m . in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] we show the distribution of the longitudinal coordinates of the dimuon production vertex , for m@xmath152.85 gev / c@xmath16 .",
    "the peaks corresponding to the position of the various production targets are clearly visible and well separated , showing that the nuclear target where the j/@xmath0  has been produced is unambiguously determined .",
    "the ms detects j/@xmath0  produced in the rapidity range 3@xmath204 .",
    "however , the acceptance of the vt for matched tracks from the j/@xmath0  decay is target - dependent , the more downstream targets covering smaller rapidities .",
    "we have therefore selected events produced in the range 3.2@xmath203.7 , which is covered for all the targets .",
    "the cut -0.5@xmath210.5 , on the polar angle of the decay muons in the collins - soper reference frame has also been applied , in order to remove events at the edge of the ms s acceptance .",
    "the transverse momentum coverage for the j/@xmath0  measurement extends down to zero @xmath22 .",
    "the acceptance varies by about 30% in the @xmath22 range accessible with the collected statistics ( @xmath23 3 gev / c ) .",
    "the j/@xmath0  signal has been extracted for each target nucleus at the two energies by fitting the opposite sign mass spectra , in the region m@xmath151.5 gev / c@xmath16 , with a superposition of the mass shapes of the expected dimuon sources .",
    "these include the drell - yan process ( dy ) , the semi - leptonic decays of correlated d - meson pairs ( @xmath24 ) , the j/@xmath0  and the @xmath25 resonances . the expected mass distributions for the dy and @xmath24 contributions have been calculated with pythia  @xcite , using the grv94lo  @xcite parton distribution functions .",
    "the j/@xmath0  events have been generated , for the 400 gev data , using the @xmath26 and @xmath22 distributions measured with good accuracy by na50  @xcite . at 158 gev , the differential distributions have been tuned directly on the data , using an iterative procedure .",
    "the events have been tracked through the set - up and then reconstructed with the same algorithm used for real data .",
    "the contribution from the combinatorial pair background due to @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays ( completely negligible in the j/@xmath0  mass region ) has been estimated through an event mixing technique  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show , as an example , the opposite - sign dimuon invariant mass distribution , relative to the kinematical domain specified above , for interactions at 158 gev .",
    "the quality of all the fits to the invariant mass spectra is satisfactory ( with @xmath29 ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 ) .",
    "the mass resolution at the j/@xmath0  peak is @xmath1870 mev / c@xmath16 , and the number of j/@xmath0  events ranges from @xmath18800 to @xmath182000 , depending on the target .",
    "the number of continuum events under the j/@xmath0  peak is very small ( @xmath304% ) , and is dominated by the dy contribution .",
    "nuclear effects have been parametrized by fitting the @xmath7dependence of the production cross section with the simple power law @xmath31 , and then studying the evolution of @xmath32 as a function of various kinematic variables .",
    "alternatively , nuclear effects have been quantified by fitting the data in the framework of the glauber model , having as input parameters the density distributions for the various nuclei .",
    "the model gives as output the so - called j/@xmath0  absorption cross section @xmath33 .",
    "clearly , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent effective quantities , including the contribution of the various sources of nuclear effects detailed in the introduction .    the nuclear effects on j/@xmath0  production",
    "have been evaluated starting from the cross section measured for each target , normalized to the cross section for the lightest one ( be ) : @xmath34    where , for the target with mass number @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the number of j/@xmath0  events , @xmath37 is the number of incident protons , @xmath38 is the number of target nuclei per unit surface , @xmath39 is the j/@xmath0  acceptance and @xmath40 is the detection efficiency . when building these ratios , the results obtained with the three be targets have been averaged .",
    "the use of relative cross sections brings several advantages .",
    "in particular , the number of incident protons cancels out ( a small attenuation factor , due to the inelastic scattering of beam particles , which is 6% for the most downstream target , has been corrected for ) since all the targets were simultaneously exposed to the beam , which had a transverse dimension much smaller than that of the targets .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of the detection efficiency related to the ms also cancels out .",
    "in fact , this detector can not distinguish the target where the dimuon has been produced .",
    "this is due to the presence of the thick hadron absorber , to the large distance between the target system and the ms tracking chambers ( 6 to 16 m ) , and to the closely spaced targets .",
    "therefore , the muon detection efficiency is independent of the production target .",
    "contrary to the ms case , the angular acceptance covered by the vt is slightly target dependent . therefore , non - uniformities in the efficiency of a certain pixel plane lead to a rapidity - dependent inefficiency which is different from target to target .",
    "the efficiency of each of the 15 vt planes has been estimated using a modified track reconstruction algorithm that excludes the plane under study .",
    "for each reconstructed track we then check the presence of a hit in that plane in a fiducial region around the intersection of the track with the plane .",
    "efficiency values are calculated on a run - per - run basis ( @xmath412 hours ) , for sub - regions of the pixel plane down to a size of @xmath180.2 mm@xmath16 , if the track statistics in the sub - region under study is large enough ( more than 40 tracks ) .",
    "otherwise , contiguous regions are grouped in order to reach a statistically significant track sample .",
    "the distribution of the efficiency values for the various regions of the vt is peaked at @xmath1890% , with 82% of the detector area having an efficiency larger than 60% . finally , the j/@xmath0  acceptances , estimated by means of the monte - carlo simulation , range between 14.9% and 23.0% in the kinematic range 3.2@xmath423.7 , @xmath430.5 .",
    "the quoted rapidity range corresponds to the center - of - mass rapidity windows 0.28@xmath440.78 at 158 gev and @xmath450.33 at 400 gev .    in table  1",
    "we summarize , target by target and for the two energies under study , the relative values of the j/@xmath0   acceptance times detection efficiencies .",
    "for completeness , we also report the relative integrated luminosities @xmath46 .",
    ".the relative values , target by target , of the integrated luminosities , and of the products @xmath47 .",
    "we have chosen as reference value the most upstream be target .",
    "the al target was not in place during the data taking at 400 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]",
    "two main features emerge from this comparison .",
    "first , when going from negative towards positive @xmath5 , @xmath32 steadily decreases .",
    "this effect was already known from the data of hera - b and e866 , taken at rather similar incident proton energies ( 920 , 800 gev ) , and a similar effect might be present in our results at 158 gev , even if the size of the errors is not negligible .",
    "second , at a constant @xmath5 , the @xmath32 values are lower when the incident proton energy is smaller , as can be seen when comparing the hera - b / e866 results with our results at 400 and 158 gev . on the other hand",
    ", it is also worth mentioning that from na3 results on j/@xmath0   production at 200 gev  @xcite one extracts @xmath32 values which are in partial contradiction with these observations , being similar to those obtained with the higher energy data samples ( hera - b / e866 ) .",
    "we also note that in our calculation of the na3 @xmath32 values , performed starting from their measured j/@xmath0  cross section ratios between and collisions , the small bias  @xcite induced by the use of a light target in the determination of @xmath32 has been corrected for . a satisfactory theoretical interpretation of the complex observed pattern is missing for the moment .",
    "various works have underlined the importance of several effects , including final state break - up , parton shadowing , initial and final state energy loss , and the presence of a charm component in the nucleon wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "however , the relative weight of these effects is still under debate .",
    "the new results from na60 at 400 and 158 gev have been obtained with the same experimental apparatus and in very similar running conditions .",
    "their direct comparison may therefore be a clean testing ground for models .",
    "interesting information can also be obtained by a simple comparison of nuclear effects as a function of various kinematic variables . as an example",
    ", we now consider the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath32 parameter , @xmath48 being the fraction of the momentum of the target nucleon carried by the parton which produces the j/@xmath02 kinematics of the main j/@xmath0 production process @xmath49 is , effectively , that of a 2@xmath501 process ( @xmath51 ) i.e. the final state gluon is very soft .",
    "the alternative 2@xmath502 approach is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "+ we also note that the relation strictly holds when @xmath52 in the c.m . frame . due to the low @xmath9 ,",
    "this is only approximately true and induces a smearing in the estimation of @xmath53 .",
    "however , in the investigated kinematic domain , the effect is similar for the two energies .",
    "the resulting @xmath54 shift in the @xmath2 values does not affect the discussion in the text . ] .",
    "this kinematic variable is particularly interesting since @xmath2 is the quantity that determines the amount of shadowing in the target nucleus ( or anti - shadowing in our kinematic range ) .",
    "furthermore , the center of mass energy of the j/@xmath0-n system , which is a relevant quantity for the final state break - up of the j/@xmath0  in the cold nuclear medium , is , to a very good approximation , a function of @xmath2 alone ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "since our results at the two energies cover , with good approximation , the same @xmath2 domain , we have performed an analysis of nuclear effects in five @xmath2 bins , covering the region 0.08 @xmath56 0.14 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shad ] we plot @xmath32 as a function of @xmath2 for the two energies under study .",
    "we also show in the same plot the expected @xmath32 value that would be obtained if shadowing were the only nuclear effect to be present .",
    "various parameterizations of nuclear shadowing have been considered  @xcite , including the recent eps09 result , where an estimate of the uncertainty of the calculation was also carried out .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : shad ] we see that shadowing alone would lead to @xmath32 values larger than 1 in our @xmath2 acceptance .",
    "this result implies that the other nuclear effects produce a significant suppression of the j/@xmath0 yield .",
    "the other remarkable feature emerging from fig .",
    "[ fig : shad ] is that @xmath32 is not the same at a fixed @xmath2 , for the two values of @xmath9 . in our analysis ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties related to the measurement of @xmath32 are partly correlated , in particular those corresponding to the measurement of the j/@xmath0 detection efficiency .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ fig:4 ]",
    "we plot , as a function of @xmath2 , the quantity @xmath57 which is affected by a significantly smaller systematic uncertainty .",
    "the results clearly indicate that @xmath58 ( in the covered @xmath2 range we have @xmath59 ) , and that @xmath60 does not vary appreciably in the @xmath2 region under study .",
    "having factorized the effect of shadowing , which is the same at the two energies at fixed @xmath2 , the observation of @xmath61 could be attributed to a stronger final state interaction at 158 gev .",
    "since , for a given @xmath2 , the kinematics of the collision of the j/@xmath0  with the target nucleons is the same at 158 and 400 gev , the observed effect may be related to a change in the j/@xmath0  break - up cross section at fixed @xmath62 .",
    "a different weight of the color - octet and color - singlet precursor @xmath63 states in the production process between the two energies could be a natural explanation .",
    "however , non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) calculations carried out in the fixed target energy domain  @xcite , only show a weak @xmath9 dependence of the color - octet and color - singlet relative contributions .",
    "therefore , a strong variation of the j/@xmath0  break - up cross section with @xmath9 seems unlikely . in such a case one should observe , for the two incident",
    "proton energies , the same @xmath32 at a given @xmath2 in contrast with our observation . in this scenario , processes different from final state break - up and parton shadowing must be advocated in order to explain the observed nuclear effects on j/@xmath0  production . in particular , effects such as the initial state energy loss of the incident parton might play an important role and deserve further investigation .     as a function of @xmath2 , for the 158 and 400 gev data samples .",
    "also shown in the plot is a calculation of @xmath32 as resulting from shadowing alone .",
    "various shadowing parameterizations have been considered.,title=\"fig : \" ]    = @xmath64 , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the empty boxes around the points represent the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty .",
    "the systematic error common to all the points is shown as a filled box around the @xmath65 line.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the na60 experiment has measured j/@xmath0  production in collisions at the cern sps , at 400 and 158 gev , the latter energy being the lowest one where a detailed systematic study has been performed .",
    "the results show a suppression of the j/@xmath0  yield in cold nuclear matter , which is larger at lower incident energy .",
    "a comparison with results from previous experiments indicates that nuclear effects on j/@xmath0  production , at constant @xmath5 , exhibit a strong @xmath9-dependence .",
    "the observation of different @xmath32 values at the two energies , for a constant @xmath2 , may suggest a strong change in the j/@xmath0  break - up cross section and/or the presence of other effects like initial state energy loss .",
    "these data can also provide an important baseline for heavy - ion collision studies .",
