    "the functions @xmath30 are not dirichlet series in the usual sense , but the confluent hypergeometric function satisfies the asymptotic expansion @xmath35 so we may say that @xmath36 can be approximated by @xmath37 . from this viewpoint it is possible to say that @xmath30 can be approximated by the dirichlet series @xmath38 in this sense @xmath30 may be regarded as generalized dirichlet series .    the meromorphic continuation of @xmath30 was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
