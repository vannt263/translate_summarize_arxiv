    "coulomb disorder plays dominant role in determining thermodynamic and kinetic properties of doped semiconductors due to its long - range nature .",
    "@xcite this physics becomes especially intriguing in the context of dirac materials , namely solid state systems that host quasiparticles with linear dispersion near the band - touching degeneracy points , such as that in @xmath0-wave superconductors , @xcite graphene , @xcite topological insulators @xcite and weyl semimetals .",
    "@xcite while the former three classes of systems have been intensively studied over almost a decade by now , materials that can be identified as weyl semimetals have been discovered only fairly recently .",
    "@xcite    theoretical studies of the effect of disorder on a single weyl node have a long history , @xcite and this problem has been revisited in a number of recent works .",
    "@xcite the prevailing point of view is that a weak disorder has negligible effect on the density of states , which vanishes quadraticaly with the energy counted from the nodal point .",
    "this behavior persists up to a certain critical disorder strength beyond which the density of states acquires a finite value at zero energy .",
    "obviously , such scenario should have serious implications for the transport properties of wsms that rely on their semimetallic nature ( a vanishing density of states at the nodal points ) .",
    "@xcite at strong disorder singular transport features are eliminated .",
    "it is thus important to have a controlled theory of disorder effects on a single nodal point .",
    "conventional treatments based on the self - consistent born approximation , though can be qualitatively correct , are uncontrolled near dirac or weyl points .",
    "@xcite    magnetotransport properties of wsms are also expected to have a highly unusual character owing to the unconventional landau quantization for the three - dimensional dirac spectrum , and the multiband nature of weyl semimetals . in particular , a strong classical negative magnetoresistance was predicted for weyl systems with long intravalley relaxation times , @xcite as well as robust linear positive magnetoresistance in the quantum limit , when a single landau level is occupied .",
    "@xcite both types of behavior were recently observed in experiments @xcite on a candidate dirac ( `` double - weyl '' ) material cd@xmath1as@xmath2 , yet at this point it can not be stated with confidence whether the experimental observations are in full correspondence with theoretical models . for various recent theoretical and experimental aspects of magnetotransport results in dirac semimetals see refs .  .",
    "in light of the recent experimental advances that triggered a flood of theoretical work , our essential motivation is to investigate the role of coulomb impurities on properties of wsms .",
    "in contrast to the model of short - range disorder , which so far received most of theoretical attention , we obtain results that are controlled by a small parameter in the limit of _ strong _ disorder .",
    "we also observe that due to the delicate interplay of landau quantization and screening effects , the low - field magnetoresistance may display nonmonotonic behavior .",
    "the latter feature is highly sensitive to the strength of interaction and thus is not universal .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion in the vicinity of a single isotropic nodal point can be described by the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath3 throughout ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are vector of the pauli matrices , and momentum measured relative to the nodal point .",
    "the total potential as seen by an electron at position @xmath8 due to randomly distributed charged impurities at positions @xmath9 is taken in the form of a yukawa - like potential @xmath10 here index @xmath11 labels impurities , @xmath12 is the dielectric constant of the host material , and @xmath13 is the inverse screening radius .",
    "we assume that impurity positions are completely random , and calculate the correlator of the disorder potential , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the concentration of impurities . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ uu ] ) , the correlation length of the disorder potential is given by the screening radius , and the magnitude of its fluctuations is given by @xmath16 .",
    "the gaussian approximation is sufficient to describe the disorder potential fluctuations when there are many impurities in the screening volume , @xmath17 .",
    "the model of a disordered weyl semimetal described above will be used in the forthcoming calculations .",
    "the validity of the gaussian approximation will be checked _ a posteriori _ , by considering the screening of coulomb impurities by electrons moving in a self - consistently screened disorder potential , see eq .",
    "( [ nuandkappa ] ) , and the text below it .",
    "a detailed account of self - consistent screening in the present problem is given in ref . .",
    "in what follows we consider the density of states ( dos ) close to the nodal point , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the electron energy .    dos at the nodal point crucially depends on the relation between the strength of disorder , and the energy scale associated with its finite correlation length , @xmath20 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the disorder is weak , and the born approximation can be used , with the expected result of zero dos at the nodal point . for strong disorder , @xmath22 ,",
    "self - consistent born approximation predicts a finite dos at the nodal point,@xcite but the approximation itself is uncontrolled .",
    "@xcite    to obtain systematic results , controlled by a small parameter , for the dos and later for transport properties , we restructure the perturbation theory for the disorder potential similarly to the way it was done for heavily doped semiconductors .",
    "@xcite a crucial observation is that for @xmath23 , the landscape of the disorder potential is smooth , in the sense that the typical length scale at which it changes , @xmath24 , is large compared to the typical electron wavelength @xmath25 .",

    "this implies that the electron motion is semiclassical .",
