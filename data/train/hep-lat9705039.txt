    "it is immediately obvious that the fine structure is much more sensitive to changes in the quark action .",
    "this is not surprising as the fine structure appears for the first time at an order one less in the relativistic expansion than the spin - independent spectrum .",
    "@xmath14 used by the nrqcd collaboration contains only the leading order spin - dependent terms and so we expect changes at the 10% level ( @xmath97 ) on using @xmath40 .",
    "it is also clear that unquenching has a big effect and will be necessary to get the right answers .",
    "comparable results with and without @xmath40 are the @xmath46 from ukqcd  @xcite and the @xmath79 from nrqcd , both on quenched configurations at @xmath1 = 6.0 . a significant ( 15@xmath93 ) effect is seen in the hyperfine splitting and the shift corresponds to a 10% effect .",
    "the shifts in the @xmath23 fine structure may turn out to be somewhat larger ( possibly as much as 20% ) but currently they are not statistically significant .",
    "a comparison of the two collaborations results with only @xmath14 shows agreement between the two different methods of smearing .",

    "we expect violations of scaling at this order in the nrqcd results from errors in the @xmath37 field in the @xmath100 term which gives rise to this splitting .",
    "figure 6 shows clear scaling violations with a slope @xmath101 given by @xmath102 900 mev , when we write  @xcite : @xmath103    it is not surprising to find scaling violations of this size since the hyperfine splitting responds to much shorter distances than spin - independent splittings and is given by a single term in @xmath13 without the cancellation that occurs for derivative type discretisation terms in spin - independent splittings .",
    "the hyperfine splitting is also sensitive to the value of the bare quark mass ( like @xmath87 ) and errors in how well this is fixed will affect figure 6 .",
    "in addition there is sensitivity to the value of @xmath64 , because the @xmath37 field contains 4 links .",
    "we expect the hyperfine splitting to vary as @xmath104 , and this was borne out by work in ref .",
    "@xcite where results with @xmath64 and without ( @xmath64 = 1 ) were compared .",
    "nrqcd and ukqcd results both use @xmath64 from the fourth root of the plaquette , denoted @xmath105 in figure 2 .",
    "recent work by trottier  @xcite has suggested that @xmath64 from the landau gauge link , @xmath106 , might provide a better estimate of the radiative corrections to @xmath107 .",
    "this might also be true for other @xmath60 if @xmath106 captures tadpole effects more accurately .",
    "this value of @xmath106 is therefore used by the sesam collaboration and has the effect of increasing the hyperfine splitting over the value that would be obtained with @xmath105 .",
    "figure 6 gives nrqcd values for the ratio of hyperfine to 2s-1s splittings that might be expected using @xmath106 by rescaling the results obtained with @xmath105 by the sixth power of the ratio of @xmath64 values .",
    "the @xmath106 results are somewhat flatter and this might indicate that some of the previous scaling violations arose from radiative corrections to @xmath107 .",
    "perturbative or non - perturbative calculations of various @xmath60 will be needed to answer the question of which @xmath64 is better ( if there is a single answer ) and allow us to include radiative corrections in the leading coefficients in a consistent next - to - leading - order calculation of fine structure .    in @xmath86 extrapolations of fine structure splittings it might not be true that @xmath86 = 3 is the relevant physical point .",
    "@xmath86 = 4 is somewhat more likely given the short distance nature of these quantities .",
    "in that case the extrapolations in @xmath86 must be done in terms of other quantities for which @xmath86 = 4 is also the physical point , and _ not _ the 1p-1s or 2s-1s splittings .",
    "indeed , there will be no value of degenerate dynamical @xmath86 for which we could get the right answer for the ratio of fine structure to spin - independent splittings . instead , for example , we would have to extrapolate the ratio of the hyperfine splitting to one of the fine structure splittings .",
    "for this ratio better scaling is seen in the nrqcd results , as shown in figure 7 , although the results at @xmath1 = 6.2 are still rather uncertain .",
    "so an extrapolation in @xmath86 could then be done .",
    "the results at different @xmath86 are shown in figure 8 , where nrqcd results are compared at @xmath86 = 0 and 2 , and ukqcd results at @xmath86 = 0 are compared to sesam results at @xmath86 = 2 .",
    "the sesam results are not strictly comparable with ukqcd since they use @xmath106 ; if @xmath105 had been used their result for the ratio plotted would be smaller by about 5% .",
    "unfortunately the fine structure splittings are not very accurate and the resulting error in extrapolating the hyperfine splitting in this way is very large . at @xmath86",
    "= 4 , the hyperfine splitting would be 40(10 ) mev .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath23 fine structure to experiment from figure 2 shows interesting features , albeit with large errors .",
    "the overall scale of the splittings given by @xmath108 is obviously too small in the quenched approximation ( and is reduced further when scaling violations are removed as for the hyperfine splitting ) .",
    "the unquenched results are much closer to experiment .",
    "the ratio of splittings , @xmath109 , is larger than experiment for the nrqcd results , 1.1(4 ) versus 0.66(2 ) . that this is probably a discretisation error is borne out by the apparent improvement in this ratio in the ukqcd results .",
    "the ratio viewed in a potential model picture has differences of long and short range effects in it and it would be unlikely to be correct in the quenched approximation , but is hard to determine accurately .",
    "the unquenched results in figure 2 look encouragingly in agreement with experiment but a full study of scaling and @xmath86 extrapolations must be done .",
    "obviously more work is required on the fine structure of the @xmath72 system and i believe that nrqcd will provide the most accurate results in this area .",
    "it will also be important to understand which quantities should be extrapolated to which values of @xmath86 or , failing this , to make configurations with ` real world ' dynamical quark content . only then will we be able to get the correct answer for all the splittings without @xmath86 extrapolations .",
    "the charmonium sector is a difficult one to simulate on the lattice , because it is neither very relativistic or very non - relativistic . for nrqcd to remain above @xmath110 of around 0.6 requires @xmath111  @xcite .",
    "each order of relativistic correction is only 30% smaller than the previous order since @xmath112 . for the standard relativistic heavy wilson approach",
    "@xcite the opposite requirement is true , @xmath113 , because of problems with fixing the meson mass as a shift from the energy at zero momentum  @xcite .",
    "there has been a long standing issue  @xcite that results for charmonium hyperfine splittings disagreed between these two methods , with the nrqcd results giving a hyperfine splitting of around 100 mev and the relativistic method around 70 mev ( experiment 116 mev ) .",
    "new work by trottier in nrqcd  @xcite using the relativistic and discretisation corrections of @xmath40 has shown that indeed the relativistic corrections from higher order terms in nrqcd are large .",
    "he finds the hyperfine splitting becomes smaller between the @xmath14 results and the @xmath40 results by a factor of 60% .",
    "this is certainly of @xmath7@xmath114 so not in principle surprising but nevertheless disappointing to proponents of nrqcd .",
    "a shift of the same size in spin - independent splittings would be a 15% effect ( certainly of the same order as the naive expectation of 10% ) since they are lower order in the non - relativistic expansion .",
    "this means a systematic error in @xmath85 determinations from nrqcd charmonium at this level if next - to - next - to - leading order spin - independent terms are not included .",
    "this is significantly less than the statistical error that can be achieved , but might nevertheless be acceptable in some applications .",
    "it seems likely that future progress in the charmonium sector will use the heavy wilson approach , possibly corrected for @xmath115 terms , as has been suggested  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental evidence for the @xmath3 particle encourages lattice predictions for the spectrum of @xmath116 bound states .",
    "early work  @xcite has used quenched configurations and nrqcd for both the @xmath5 and the @xmath4 quarks .",
    "more recent results are collected in figure 10 .",
    "these include nrqcd collaboration results analysed by martin gorbahn on dynamical configurations from the milc collaboration ( @xmath1 = 5.415 , @xmath86 = 2 , ks , @xmath83 = 0.0125 ) and ukqcd results from hugh shanahan using nrqcd @xmath5 and relativistic ( tadpole - improved clover ) @xmath4 quarks on @xmath1 = 6.2 quenched configurations . for comparison the older results  @xcite are shown and results from a potential model analysis  @xcite .",
    "there is no clear discrepancy with the potential model results as yet , despite the fact that the @xmath4 quark is more relativistic in @xmath3 than in charmonium .",

    "this is quite significant in the quenched approximation because the value of @xmath85 depends on whether it is fixed from the @xmath0 or @xmath2 system and the values of the bare quark masses have also been fixed separately within these systems .",
    "the splittings in figure 10 will change somewhat if the quark masses were altered . to perform consistent extrapolations in @xmath86",
