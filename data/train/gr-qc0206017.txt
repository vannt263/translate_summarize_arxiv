    "this paper introduces a `` quick and dirty '' method for making a first pass at the lisa data analysis problem .",
    "lisa will be sensitive to gravitational wave sources in the frequency range @xmath0 to @xmath1 hz , which nicely complements the frequencies range covered by the ground based detectors ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 hz ) .",
    "the data analysis challenges posed by lisa are very different from those encountered with the ground based detectors .",
    "unlike the situation faced by the ground based observatories , most of the sources that lisa hopes to detect have well understood gravitational waveforms - indeed many of them will be monochromatic and unchanging over the life of the experiment .",
    "the difficulty comes when we include lisa s orbital motion and the modulations this introduces into the signal .",
    "since lisa is designed to orbit at 1 au , the modulations introduce sidebands at multiples of the orbital frequency of @xmath4 .    the approach we investigate here works by correcting for the dominant , doppler modulation .",
    "this has the effect of re - assembling most of the fourier power of a monochromatic source into a single spike .",
    "since the correction depends on where the source is located on the sky , we are able to locate a source and its frequency .",
    "the doppler demodulation approach is familiar to radio astronomers , and has been discussed in relation to gravitational wave astronomy@xcite .",
    "doppler demodulation forms an integral part of ground based gravitational wave searches for continuous gravitational wave sources such as pulsars@xcite .",
    "however , the unique orbital motion of the lisa observatory , and the different frequency range that it covers , demand a separate treatment of the doppler demodulation approach to lisa data analysis .",
    "lisa will output a time series describing the strain in the detector as a function of time , @xmath5 .",
    "the strain will be a combination of the signal , @xmath6 , and noise , @xmath7 , in the detector : @xmath8 .",
    "because of lisa s orbital motion , a source that is monochromatic at the sun s barycenter will be spread over a range of frequencies . a monochromatic gravitational wave with frequency @xmath9 and amplitudes @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the plus and cross polarizations will produce the response@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13\\ , .\\ ] ] the amplitude modulation @xmath14 , frequency modulation @xmath15 and phase modulation @xmath16 are given by @xmath17^{1/2 } \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",

    "each of the modulations is periodic in the orbital frequency @xmath20 .",
    "the angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 give the sky location of the source , @xmath23 is the phase of the wave and @xmath24 au is the earth - sun distance .",
    "the frequency modulation , which is caused by the time dependent doppler shifting of the gravitational wave in the rest frame of the detector , is the dominant effect for frequencies above @xmath25 hz@xcite . ignoring the amplitude and phase modulation for now",
    ", pure doppler modulation takes the form @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\quad = \\re\\left ( a   \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty } j_n(\\beta ) e^{2\\pi",

    "if lisa were at rest with respect to the sky , each monochromatic source would produce a spike in the power spectrum of @xmath6 .",
    "while this would make data analysis very easy , it would also severely limit the science that could be done as it would be impossible to determine the source location or orientation .",
    "since lisa will move with respect to the sky , each source will have its own unique modulation pattern , and this pattern can be used to fix its location and orientation . on the other hand , the modulation makes the data analysis more complicated as the fourier power of each source is spread over a wide bandwidth @xmath36 .",
    "one approach to the data analysis problem is to demodulate the signal , thereby re - assembling all the power of a given source at one frequency .",
    "since each source has a unique modulation , each source will also require a unique demodulation .",
    "demodulating a particular source is not difficult if one happens to know its frequency , location , orientation and orbital phase .",
    "one could imagine searching through this parameter space and looking for spikes in the power spectrum corresponding to sources that have been properly demodulated .",
    "a more practical approach is to focus on the doppler modulation as it causes the largest spreading of the fourier power .",
    "consider the doppler modulated phase @xmath37 + \\varphi_0 \\ , .\\ ] ] we seek a new time coordinate @xmath38 in which this phase is stationary : @xmath39 thus , @xmath40 working to first order in @xmath41 we have @xmath42    taking the data stream from the detector over a one year period and performing a fast fourier transform allows us to write @xmath43 performing the coordinate transformation ( [ ctran ] ) we arrive at the new fourier expansion @xmath44 where the fourier coefficients @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 since the modulation has a limited bandwidth , an excellent approximation to @xmath45 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 \\ , .\\ ] ] the square brackets imply that we have taken the integer part of @xmath50 .",
    "consider the pure doppler modulation described in ( [ dop ] ) for the simple case where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is an integer ( the non - integer case is more involved , but the idea is the same ) .",
    "the source has fourier components @xmath53 so that @xmath54 using the neumann addition theorem , @xmath55 and the fact that @xmath56 , we find @xmath57 in other words , the doppler demodulation procedure re - assembles all the power at the barycenter frequency @xmath51 .",
    "the demodulation is less effective when applied to a real lisa source because it does not correct for the amplitude and phase modulations .",
    "our fourier space approach is very efficient if one is interested in a limited frequency range . it does not offer any great saving over a direct implementation in the time domain if one wants to consider all frequencies at once .",
    "hellings@xcite has recently implemented the doppler demodulation procedure in the time domain and found similar results to ours .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 0,135)@xmath58 ( 125,45)@xmath9    to illustrate how the doppler demodulation works we consider monochromatic , circular newtonian binaries as described in ref .",
    "figure 1 shows the power spectrum of @xmath6 before and after doppler demodulation for a source with @xmath59 hz , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we see that most of the power is collected into a spike of width @xmath62 about the barycenter frequency .",

    "the sources have @xmath63 hz , @xmath64 and @xmath65 hz , @xmath66 .",
    "the higher frequency source has an amplitude @xmath67 times larger than the lower frequency source .",

    "consider sources a and b described in table 1 .",
    "the amplitude of source b is 1.59 times larger than the amplitude of source a. figure 3 shows what happens when we demodulate source a and source b in turn . because the two sources overlap",
    ", their signals interfere with each other , and the demodulation is only able to detect the stronger of the two sources .",

    "we use the healpix@xcite hierarchical , equal area pixelization scheme to provide a finite number of sky locations to demodulate .",
    "we search for the maximum power contained in three adjacent frequency bins , and record this value for each sky pixel . rather than find the maxima across all frequencies ,",
    "we produce separate sky maps for frequency intervals of width @xmath68 .",
    "there is little point in trying to use smaller frequency intervals due to the interference effect discussed earlier .",
    "we begin by considering an isolated source ( i.e. no other sources with overlapping bandwidths ) with @xmath69 hz and @xmath70 . using sky pixels of angular size @xmath71 we arrive at the graph shown in figure 4 .",
    "the demodulation code produced the best fit values of @xmath72 hz and @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the degenerate fit for the sky location illustrates one of the drawbacks of the doppler demodulation method - it is unable to distinguish between sources above or below the equator .",
    "the errors in the source location , @xmath75 , are larger than the pixel size , and can be attributed to the amplitude and phase modulations which we have not corrected for .",
    "it should be noted that the error in the source location is not caused by instrument noise since we are working in the large signal - to - noise limit ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "indeed , instrument noise has little effect on the demodulation procedure since the noise is incoherent .",
    "the noise gets moved about in frequency space , but there is little power accumulation at any one frequency .",
    "when noise was added to the previous example at a signal to noise ratio of 5 , the frequency determination and @xmath22 determination were unaffected , while the error in @xmath77 grew to @xmath78 .    finally , we illustrate how the source interference phenomena discussed earlier limits our ability to locate sources that overlap in frequency .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show how the demodulation procedure is able to locate sources a and b when one of the sources is turned off .",
    "figure 7 shows what happens when both sources are present .",
    "we see that source b shows up clearly , while source a is washed out .",
    "the doppler demodulation procedure provides a quick way of finding the frequencies and sky locations of the brightest sources detected by lisa .",
    "the method has a number of limitations , the most serious being its inability to locate more than one source per bandwidth , and its inability to determine if a source is in the northern or southern hemisphere .",
    "despite these limitations , the doppler demodulation procedure will be a useful tool in the lisa data analysis arsenal .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank tom prince and the members of the montana gravitational wave astronomy group - bill hisock , ron hellings and matt benacquista - for many stimulating discussions .",
