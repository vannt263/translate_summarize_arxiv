    "bl lacertae objects are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , exhibiting strong , rapidly variable polarization and continuum emission , and core - dominated radio emission with apparent superluminal motion ( see e.g. kollgaard et al .",
    "1992 for references ) .",
    "these properties have led to the commonly accepted view that bl lacs are dominated by doppler - boosted synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet nearly along our line - of - sight ( blandford & rees 1978 ) .",
    "the line emission of bl lacs is absent or weak , making their redshift determination rather difficult .    in the current unified models of radio - loud agn ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) ,",
    "bl lacs are identified as low luminosity , core - dominated f - r i ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies ( rg ) viewed nearly along the axis of the relativistically boosted jet .",
    "this model appears supported by the comparison of their extended radio luminosity and morphology ( e.g. perlman & stocke 1993 ) , host galaxy luminosity and morphology ( e.g. wurtz et al .",
    "1996 ; hereafter wsy96 ) and space density and beamed luminosity functions ( e.g. padovani & urry 1990 ; morris et al . 1991 ; celotti et al . 1993 ) .",
    "knowledge of the properties of the host galaxies and environments where agn live is fundamental for the understanding of the formation of agn in galaxies .",
    "comparison of orientation - independent properties of bl lacs , such as the host galaxies and environment , with those of rgs , allow one to test the unified model based on orientation ( antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . the frequency of close companions will determine whether interactions are important for triggering of the bl lac activity , as seems to be the case for quasars ( e.g. heckman 1990 ; hutchings & neff 1992 ) .",
    "possible cosmological evolution in the properties of the hosts and environments can be studied by comparing agn properties at different redshifts .",
    "finally , the alternative gravitational lensing hypothesis for bl lac activity ( ostriker & vietri 1990 ) can be tested by measuring the predicted offsets between the bl lacs and their host galaxies .",
    "recent studies of bl lac hosts and close environments from the ground and with the hst ( see pesce et al 1995 ; falomo 1996 ; owen et al . 1996 ; wsy96 ; wurtz et al .",
    "1997 ; falomo et al .",
    "1997 ; scarpa et al 1999a ; urry et al . 1999a ; urry et al . 1999b , hereafter u99b ; heidt et al .",
    "1999 ) have shown that their host galaxies are luminous ( m@xmath5 23 to 24 ) and large ( r(e ) = 10@xmath37 kpc ) elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are on average @xmath61 mag brighter than l@xmath7 galaxies ( e.g. mobasher et al .",
    "1993 ) and of similar luminosity or slightly fainter than the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ; e.g. hoessel et al .",
    "intriguingly , bl lac hosts appear slightly fainter than f - r i hosts and resemble better typical f - r ii hosts .",
    "detections or claims of disk hosts and/or inner disks components have been made in a handful of sources ( e.g. ms 0205.7 + 3509 stocke wurtz and perlman 1995 ; oq 530 abraham et al 1991 ; pks 1413 + 135 , mchardy et al .",
    "1991 ; pks 0548 - 322 , falomo et al .",
    "1995 ; 1es 1959 + 650 , heidt et al . 1999 ; ) . while it is not unreasonable to find small inner disk structures similarly to what found in normal ellipticals , the objects with a disk dominated host galaxy are rather controversial ( for details",
    "see : falomo et al 1997 ; stocke et al 1992 ; lamer , newsam , and mchardy 1999 ; scarpa et al 1999a , b ) .",
    "close companions have been found around many bl lacs , some with signs of interaction , but the physical association has been confirmed only in some cases through spectroscopic measurements . bl lacs usually reside in poor clusters , unlike f - r i rgs .",
    "a modified unified model has therefore been proposed in which bl lacs either include partly f - r iis in addition to f - r is , or bl lacs avoid the brightest f - r is and the f - r is in rich clusters at low redshift ( wsy96 ) .",
    "this scenario seems also supported by recent measurements of radio polarization of bl lacs ( stanghellini et al 1997 ) that show signature of a f - r ii population .",
    "similarly to the case of quasars ( e.g. hutchings et al . 1994 ; rnnback et al . 1996",
    "; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) , the study of bl lac host galaxies is rather problematic because of the presence of the bright nucleus that swamps the light of the host galaxy , although the nucleus / host luminosity ratio of the bl lacs is smaller than that of quasars .",
    "the use of hst images can substantially improve the ability to study the host close to the nucleus , however , as we shall show in section 4.2.2 , hst data are usually not deep enough to properly investigate the external fainter regions of the host galaxies ( see also e.g. hutchings et al . 1994 ; bahcall et al 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on a large , homogeneous data set of observations of bl lacs secured mainly with sub - arcsec resolution from the nordic optical telescope ( not ) in la palma .",
    "we have observed the complete sample of 26 x - ray selected ( or high frequency peaked , hbl ) bl lacs derived from the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; stocke et al .",
    "this sample is almost complete for multiwavelength information and redshift ( although some redshifts are tentative and probably wrong , see the appendix ) and most of the objects are at z@xmath40.3 , ensuring the detection of the host in most cases with reasonable observing time .",
    "additionally , we obtained images for 26 bl lacs in the _ einstein _ slew survey ( perlman et al 1996 ) .",
    "these bl lacs are also of hbl type and are compared with the emss targets .",
    "based on the current data , we have previously published a separate study of the peculiar bl lac object ms 0205.7 + 3509 ( falomo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the samples of the objects observed . in section 3",
    "we give details of the observations , data reduction and describe the image analysis .",
    "results and discussion on the overall properties of the host galaxies , including comparison with previous studies of bl lacs and other types of agn are given in section 4 .",

    "the ipc slew survey ( perlman et al . 1996 ) was constructed using the _ einstein _ slew data taken when the satellite was moving from one target to the next ( elvis et al .",

    "6 we compare the radial profiles observed in this study of three bl lacs with those derived from hst images ( scarpa et al 1999b ) .",
    "the three objects were chosen to represent different well resolved ( ms 0257.9 + 3429 ) , poorly resolved ( 1es 1218 + 304 ) and unresolved sources ( ms 1402.3 + 0416 ) both in the not and hst images . while the hst data allow one to investigate the host much closer to the nucleus , the not images are clearly much deeper .",
    "this is partly due to the longer exposure times and to the favorable pixel scale of the not data .",
    "this translates into a better capability for the not images of mapping the faint outer regions of the galaxies .",
    "also , fig . 6 clearly shows the effect of different seeing on the psf in the ground based images ( 05 for ms 0257.9 + 3429 and 10 for 1es 1218 + 304 ) .",
    "an optimal characterization of the host galaxies would thus be obtained by combining the high resolution ( hst ) images with the deeper ground - based observations .",
    "the relevance of this point in a larger sample of bl lacs will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .      according to the unified schemes of radio - loud agn ( see e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , bl lacs and rgs of f - r i type morphology are identical objects seen along different angles with respect to the relativistic jet .",
    "a number of optical studies have reported on the optical properties of rgs ( see govoni et al 1999 and references therein ) .",

    "a general trend has been reported suggesting that f - r i rgs are on average brighter and in denser environments than those hosting f - r ii rgs",
    ". comparison among various samples is hindered by the selection procedure and by possible systematic effects introduced by the analysis ( e.g. extinction , k - correction , passband , method of measurement of galaxy magnitude , etc ) . in order to reduce as much as possible the systematic effects we compare our results with those obtained by govoni et al ( 1999 ) for a large sample of low redshift rgs .",
    "this sample includes 79 rgs of both f - r i and f - r ii type in the redshift interval 0.01 to 0.1 .",
    "@xmath0band imaging is used to investigate in detail the morphological and photometric properties of the radio galaxies .",
    "this includes the analysis of the luminosity profile using the same procedure and the corrections used in this work .",
    "the average host luminosity of the f - r i and f - r ii rg hosts are @xmath48 = -24.1@xmath30.6 and @xmath49 = -23.6@xmath30.7 .",
    "the bl lac hosts appear therefore on average slightly brighter than f - r ii hosts , but also slightly fainter than the f - r i rg hosts , which are in turn quite similar to bcgs in moderately rich clusters at z@xmath40.15 ( @xmath50 = 24.1@xmath30.3 ; hoessel et al .",
    "note that since the rgs are at lower redshift , any cosmological evolutionary correction makes the difference from fr i even larger .",
    "a similar trend was also noted by lamer mc hardy newsam ( 1999 ) comparing bl lacs and fr i galaxies in the near infrared .",
    "on the other hand the comparison between bl lac hosts and the whole sample of rg shows a general good agreement . in fig .",
    "7 we report the histogram and cumulative distribution of the absolute host magnitudes of the bl lacs and the rgs from govoni et al .",
    "the two distributions are rather similar with only a significant excess of more bright rg that are not present in the bl lacs .",
    "if we compare bl lacs with f - r i and f - r ii separately the agreement is formally good for f - r ii but not for f - r i. a k - s test yields formally p@xmath40 = 0.250 and 0.004 for f - r ii and f - r i respectively compared with bl lac host luminosities .",
    "since the selection procedure that identifies samples of bl lacs and of rg is different , we can not rule out that selection effects may introduce some bias .",
    "these effects should be related to correlations between host optical luminosity and x - ray and radio properties which are used to classify the objects .",
    "the present result indicates that from the point of view of host luminosities either the parents of bl lacs are rg of both types ( i and ii ) or for some reason brightest f - r i must be excluded from the parent population as proposed by wsy96 .",
    "the first association of bl lacs with f - r i was done on the basis of similar extended radio emission ( browne 1983 , wardle et al 1984 ; antonucci & ulvestad 1985 ) .",
    "there are however some observations ( e.g. kollgaard et al 1992 , murphy et al 1993 ) that indicate that at least some bl lac object may have diffuse emission more similar to that of f - r ii than f - r i. the same conclusion is reached from the kpc scale radio polarization study of six bl lacs ( stanghellini et al 1997 ) where the magnetic field is parallel to the radio jet axis for most of its length as found in f - r ii sources .",
    "if the radio morphology of these bl lacs be of f - r i type the magnetic field should be dominated by the component perpendicular to jet axis .",
    "our results therefore are consistent with the idea that bl lacs avoid the bcgs in rich clusters at low redshift ( wurtz et al.1997 ) although there are examples of bl lacs in very luminous hosts and members of group / clusters of galaxies ( see 1es 0414 + 009 and pks 0548 - 322 ; this study and falomo et al 1995 ; 1es1741 + 196 heidt et al 1999 ) .",
    "this idea is also supported by the narrow - angle tail radio morphology seen in many bl lacs and non - bcgs ( e.g. owen & laing 1989 ; perlman & stocke 1993 ) and by the correlation between cluster richness and the bcg and bl lac luminosity ( thuan & romanishin 1981 ; wurtz et al . 1997 ) .    on",
    "the other hand evidence is growing that also from the point of view of the extended radio luminosities many bl lacs are quite different from fr i and share the characteristic luminosity of fr ii sources ( cassaro et al 1999 ) .",
    "this evidence together with our results on the host luminosities led to argue that both types of rg form the parent population of bl lacs .",
    "it is well established that elliptical galaxies form families of homologous systems with characteristic parameters r(e ) , @xmath21(e ) and velocity dispersion @xmath51 .",
    "these are commonly represented in the fundamental plane ( see e.g. djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "we have investigated the properties of the bl lac hosts in the projected fundamental plane ( f - p ) concerning the central surface brightness @xmath21(e ) and the scale length r(e ) .",
    "surface brightness @xmath21(e ) derived from the fit ( see table 3 ) was corrected for galactic extinction , k  correction and for the ( 1+z)@xmath52 cosmological dimming .",
    "8 shows the correlation between @xmath21(e ) and log r(e ) for the bl lac hosts and the low redshift rg hosts ( govoni et al .",
    "it can be seen that the behavior of the emss and slew bl lac hosts are similar . both bl lac hosts and the rg hosts ( govoni et al .",
    "1999 ) follow the kormendy relation for giant massive ellipticals ( e.g. capaccioli et al . 1992 ) , with a best - fit correlation @xmath21(e ) = 16.45 + 4.6 @xmath10 ( log r(e ) ) .",
    "practically no host galaxy is in the ( scatter ) area at log r(e ) @xmath4 0.5 kpc .",
    "this confirms that the bl lac hosts are almost exclusively drawn from the population of giant ellipticals and not from normal field ellipticals .",
    "note that the bl lac hosts seem to avoid the area of the brightest and largest galaxies in the bottom right hand corner of fig .",

    "the resolved bl lac hosts lie within about 1 mag spread on the h  z relation , as do the rgs .",
    "based on this diagram we can estimate the redshift of the four objects with unknown redshift but resolved in our images . these are 0033 + 59 , 1106 + 24 , 2037 + 52 , and 2336 + 05 ( see fig .",

    "1999 ) with luminosities larger than m@xmath72 , none of the observed bl lacs are found in such a luminous galaxy .",
