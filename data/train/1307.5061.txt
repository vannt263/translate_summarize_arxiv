    "long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , whose durations are longer than 2 s , are considered to originate from core collapses of massive stars @xcite . in standard collapsar scenario , a relativistic jet launched from a central engine ( a black - hole ( bh ) accretion disk or a magnetar ) burrows through the progenitor , and finally punches out . then the prompt gamma rays are produced by some dissipation processes in the jet , although the mechanism is still uncertain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "so far , some lgrbs were associated with type ic supernova ( sn ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which might imply that collapsars come from co wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "they are plausible progenitors from the theoretical point of view in that they have no hydrogen and helium envelopes , and thus jets can penetrate them more easily @xcite .",
    "also , the typical observed duration of lgrbs , @xmath4 , is consistent with the accretion timescale of the wr progenitor envelope onto the central engine .",
    "the above wr model could not be applied to recently discovered ultra - long grbs ( ulgrbs ) , grb 101225a , grb 111209a , and grb 121027a @xcite .",
    "they all have observed durations of @xmath5 , which are much longer than the anticipated central engine lifetimes of co wr collapsars .",
    "there were a few proposals in the literature for the _",
    "christmas burst _ , grb 101225a , such as a tidal disruption of a comet by a galactic neutron star  @xcite , or an extragalactic outburst triggered by a stellar merger in a neutron - star binary system at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "however , at least the former model is now unlikely in terms of the energetics after the redshifts of these bursts are determined ; @xmath7 for grb 101225 , @xmath8 for grb 111209a , and @xmath9 for grb 121027a @xcite .",
    "other possible non - collapsar - jet scenarios are sn shock breakouts  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or tidal disruption of a star by the supermassive black hole at a galactic center @xcite",
    ". however , these models may be incompatible with the observed spectra and light curves ( see  [ subsec : other_scenario ] ) .    in the collapsar - jet scenario , a longer duration can be simply interpreted by fall - back accretion of a progenitor envelope  @xcite , or direct envelope collapse of a more massive and extended progenitor like blue supergiant ( bsg )  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the latter possibility . at first sight",
    ", the extended envelope seems problematic for the jet penetration , but the accretion of the massive envelope activates the central engine long enough for the jet to break out the progenitor .",
    "indeed , analytical and numerical calculations showed that relativistic jets from bsg collapsars can penetrate the progenitor envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this emission may reflect the contribution from an underlying sn and is an unique signature of ulgrbs .",
    "this underlying sn component is up to @xmath2 times brighter than hypernovae associated with lgrbs and is comparable to the so - called superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) .",
    "we investigate the possibility that such a slsn - like component is ascribed to a _ cocoon - fireball photospheric emission _",
    "( cfpe )  @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we already proposed the idea that such a cfpe may be a necessary counterpart of bsg grbs and estimated its basic properties using a simple analytical model .",
    "in this paper , we refine our model of the cfpe and explicitly show that the underlying sn component of grb 111209a afterglow is quite well explained by the cfpe .",
    "we also apply our model to the other two bursts , grb 101225a and grb 121027a .",
    "then we suggest that some fraction of the observed slsne might be originated from the cfpe of off - axis ulgrbs .",

    "we also apply our model to the other two bursts , grb 101225a and grb 121027a .",
    " [ sec : diss ] and  [ sec : sum ] are devoted to the discussions and summary . in appendix",

    "the jet breaks have not been confirmed until @xmath19 , which gives constraints on the jet opening angles ; @xmath20 ( grb 111209a ) and @xmath21 ( grb 121027a ) @xcite . for grb 101225a",
    ", x - ray afterglow is not detected after the end of the steep decay phase @xmath22 and no constraint is given to the jet opening angle @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature was found in the uv / optical / ir afterglow of grb 111209a  @xcite , which we mainly discuss in this paper .",
    ", some complex features ( rebrightening and decay ) are seen in the uv / optical / ir light curves .",
    "@xcite performed detailed temporal and spectral analysis of these features . on the contrary",
    ", we focus on the afterglow light curves after @xmath23 . ] for @xmath24 day , the u - band light curve exhibits a single power law decay with @xmath25 , which is similar to x - ray band , while the j - band light curve decays more slowly as @xmath26 .",
    "the difference between u - band and j - band temporal indices ( @xmath27 ) contradicts that predicted from the standard external shock model ( @xmath28 ) which can be seen from eq . .",
    "@xcite argued that these emissions may be supernova bump , which are clearly different from other grb - associated sn , and are as bright as the so called superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) , which are typically brighter than the normal sn by a factor of @xmath29 100 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "grb 101225a also showed very shallow temporal decay ( @xmath30 in r - band and @xmath31 in i - band ) for late - time grb afterglow .",
    "these are also ascribed to an underlying supernova component whose peak luminosity is comparable to the grb - associated hypernova , sn 1998bw @xcite .",
    "although such a sn - like bump has not been reported yet for grb 121027a , it may be an unique feature of ulgrbs .",
    ".observed characteristics of ulgrbs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     grb 121027a consists of the prompt phase for @xmath32 and the giant x - ray flare phase for @xmath33 . in this paper",
    ", we suppose that this giant x - ray flare is also related to the central engine activity , and both phases are due to the activity of the jets .",
    "we set the jet opening angle as @xmath34 , which is consistent with a constraint of @xmath21  @xcite . by adopting @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the observed prompt",
    "emission is roughly reproduced as @xmath37 and @xmath38 . and",
    "@xmath39 with those for grb 111209a , the calculated duration @xmath38 is larger than that of grb 111209a ( @xmath40 ) calculated in  [ subsec:111209a ] .",
    "this is because grb 121027a has higher redshift of @xmath9 than that of grb 111209a ( @xmath8 ) . ]",
    "the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta and the cocoon parameters are given as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively ( see table [ tab : parameter ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:121027a ] , we show the afterglow lcs in xrt ( left panel ) and uv / optical / ir band ( right panel ) . in the right panel , each color corresponds to g ( blue ) , r ( green ) , i ( magenta ) , and j ( red ) band , respectively .",
    "we find that the xrt lc for @xmath44 can be fitted well with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "for uv / optical / ir band , the observed data have been reported only at @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "provided that the observed fluxes at @xmath47 are attributed to the standard afterglow emissions , they are reproduced by setting @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( right panel ) .",
    "the cfpes are shown with thin - dashed lines , which slightly exceed the standard afterglow components in optical / ir bands at @xmath51 .",
    "for this burst , the standard afterglow components are relatively bright due to the high acceleration efficiency of relativistic electrons , @xmath52 ( see table [ tab : parameter ] ) .",
    "so the cfpes are almost buried compared to the standard afterglow components , although cfpes are as bright as the observed slsne .",
    "we predict that a slsn - like bump might have appeared at @xmath51 in the optical / ir afterglow light curve of grb 121027a .",
    "in the previous section , we show that a ulgrb with a slsn - like bump , in particular grb 111209a , can be interpreted by the collapsar - jet scenario of bsg progenitors .",
    "the prompt gamma - ray emissions and the standard afterglow emissions are attributed to a relativistic jet , while the slsn - like bump comes from a non - relativistic cocoon fireball . in this model , only the slsn - like component may be seen , if the observer locates along the off - axis direction from the ulgrb jet , due to the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "then we can propose that a fraction of slsne are originated from off - axis ulgrbs .",
    "indeed , the anticipated event rate of such off - axis ulgrbs can be not much less than that of the observed slsne @xcite .",
    "this conjecture can be tested , for example , by searching the orphan afterglow of a ulgrb associated with a slsn .",
    "after the relativistic jet is decelerated enough , it begins to spread sideways to become a mildly - relativistic spherical ejecta and afterglow emissions can be seen as an orphan afterglow for off - axis observers afterward it  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the simultaneous and the follow - up observations in optical or radio bands would play a key role for testing the proposed association . note that , by stacking the proposed slsne , we might also detect gev - tev neutrinos , which are produced during the jet propagation inside bsg progenitors  @xcite .      here",
    ", we present the parameter dependence of our model .",
    "first , let us discuss the jet propagation inside a progenitor .",
    "for a fixed jet efficiency @xmath39 , a broader jet opening angle @xmath53 gives a slower jet head .",
    "if the jet head can not reach the surface of the progenitor before the engine stops , i.e. , @xmath54 ( see appendix [ subsec : jet ] ) , the jet fails to penetrate the progenitor . in particular",
    ", we find that for a fiducial jet efficiency @xmath55 , jets fail to penetrate the progenitor bsg for @xmath56 . for twice energetic jets with @xmath35",
    ", they fail to penetrate for @xmath57 . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath58",
    ", there is a lower limit of @xmath39 for the jet penetration . for the bsg progenitor with @xmath34 ,",
    "jets are possible to penetrate the envelope for @xmath59 .",
    "cfpes are also affected by @xmath58 and @xmath39 .",
    "the duration and the luminosity of cfpes roughly scale with the internal energy @xmath60 , the baryon mass @xmath61 , and the initial cocoon - fireball radius @xmath62 as @xmath63 @xmath64 eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) can be easily derived if we remind the fact that @xmath65 is determined by the equality between the photon diffusion time and the dynamical time @xmath66 of the cfpe , while the luminosity is derived from the photon diffusion equation at @xmath67 .",
    "we find that for a fixed @xmath39 , @xmath61 increases with @xmath58 , while @xmath60 hardly changes .",
    "therefore , one can expect a longer and dimmer cfpe for a larger @xmath58 . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath60 increases with @xmath39 , while @xmath61 hardly changes .",
    "therefore , one can expect a shorter and brighter cfpe for a larger @xmath39 .",
    "we also study the progenitor dependence of our model . for that purpose , we fix the central engine parameters as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are the same as those used in  [ subsec:111209a ] and",
    "are applied to the massive ( @xmath68 ) bsg progenitor .",
    "we confirm that a lower mass bsg progenitor can reproduce the observed features of ulgrb prompt emissions .",
    "for example , if we consider a bsg with pre - collapse mass @xmath69 and radius @xmath70 @xcite , the duration and the isotropic energy of grb 111209a are roughly reproduced as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath73 .",
    "cocoon parameters are also calculated as @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in this case , the cfpes at @xmath76 have the peak magnitude of @xmath77 mag ( with extinction of @xmath78 mag ) in j - band and the duration of @xmath79 day .",
    "note that for the massive bsg progenitor case , the peak magnitude of the cfpe is @xmath10 mag ( with extinction of @xmath78 mag ) in j - band and the emission timescale is @xmath80 day ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:111209a ] ) .",
    "we find that while the duration of the cfpes slightly differs , the luminosity of the cfpes from the lower mass bsg becomes several times lower than those from the more massive bsg progenitor .",
    "thus , we can infer the mass or radius of a bsg progenitor from the observation of cfpes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we also find that wr progenitors can not explain the observed slsn - like bump in light of both the luminosity and the duration .",
    "a wr progenitor with zams mass @xmath81 and metallicity @xmath82 has mass @xmath83 and radius @xmath84 in the pre - collapse phase @xcite .",
    "we calculate the cfpes from this wr progenitor by applying our model with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which give the cocoon parameters as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "we find that the peak magnitude of the cfpes at @xmath76 becomes @xmath87 mag ( with extinction of @xmath78 mag ) in j - band , which is almost 100 times dimmer than those for the massive ( @xmath68 ) bsg progenitor case .",
    "the light curve peak is reached on @xmath88 in j - band , which is much earlier than that of the bsg progenitor case . from these results , we conclude that bright cfpes may be an unique characteristic of grbs from bsg progenitors ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting application of the bsg model is to population iii ( pop iii ) stars , metal - free stars formed dominantly at high redshifts .",
    "pop iii stars are considered to become massive bsgs in their pre - collapse phase because of their metal - free envelopes , although the typical mass has a large theoretical uncertainty , i.e. , @xmath89 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that pop iii grbs can be seen as ulgrbs , and they potentially dominate at higher redshifts if the bsg model holds . for broad mass range of pop iii bsg progenitors , many authors have argued that both prompt and standard afterglow signals of pop iii grbs would be detectable using future facilities @xcite .    as we have discussed so far , bright cfpes may be common characteristics of bsg grbs .",
    "in addition to the prompt and standard afterglow emissions , cfpes from pop iii grbs will be detectable even at @xmath90 with future facilities like _ jwst _ nircam @xcite , which will provide us valuable information about the star formation history in the high-@xmath91 universe .",
    "finally , we here discuss other possible scenarios proposed to explain ulgrbs .    for grb 101225a ,",
    "two different scenarios were proposed just after the discovery .",
    "one is the tidal disruption of a minor body by a galactic neutron star @xcite , and the other is related to the stellar merger of a neutron star with a helium star at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "now we know that the observed ulgrbs are extragalactic origin , the former galactic scenario is unlikely . on the other hand",
    ", the latter scenario predicts that afterglow emissions are suppressed as in grb 101225a , and thus can not be directly applied to grb 111209a and 121027a .    in collapsar - jet scenario ,",
    "a longer activity of a central engine can be realized by implementing a fall - back accretion  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite divide grb 121027a into a prompt phase with a duration of @xmath92 and an x - ray - flare phase with @xmath93 , and showed that the x - ray flare with a sharp rising can be explained by a fall - back accretion of falling back mass @xmath94 from the radius @xmath95 .",
    "although our model does not take into account the effect of fall - back accretion , the bsg model itself is compatible with this interpretation , since the fall - back accretion can naturally occur in massive bsgs .",
    "shock - breakout scenario can also reproduce the observed duration of ulgrbs by implementing a large breakout radius , @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "however , shock - breakout emissions would show relatively smooth light curves and quasi - thermal spectra  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is not the case for the observed ulgrbs .",
    "tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes can also give long lasting emissions  @xcite .",
    "however , the observed tidal disruption events have isotropic luminosities @xmath97 , which are orders - of - magnitude dimmer than ulgrbs ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "also , this scenario predicts a prompt light curve with temporal dependence @xmath99",
    "@xcite , which is inconsistent with the observed ulgrbs .",
    "ulgrbs have durations of @xmath100 , which is much longer than that of lgrbs ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the observed afterglow light curves show slsn - like bumps , which are @xmath2 times brighter than a grb - associated hypernova , sn 1998bw .",
    "such long durations are naturally explained , if we consider bsg collapsars rather than wr collapsars , since the accretion of a massive hydrogen envelope activates the central engine for a long duration . in the bsg model ,",
    "ulgrbs necessarily accompany slsn - like transients in afterglow phase , as shown in @xcite .",
    "they considered photospheric emissions from the expanding cocoon fireball , which is formed during the jet propagation in the progenitor and breaks out the progenitor along with the jet . in this paper , we refine our previous model for cocoon - fireball photospheric emissions ( cfpes ) , and interpret the observed slsn - like bump as the cfpe . for grb 111209a and grb 101225a , we find that if we have enough observations , i.e. , the duration , isotropic energy , x - ray and uv / optical / ir afterglow light curves , and slsn - like bump , the observed features of a ulgrb and slsn - like bump are reproduced quite well , for a given set of the progenitor model ; the jet opening angle , and the ambient gas density . for grb 121027a , uv / optical / ir afterglow data after @xmath101 are not published yet , and we predict that slsn - like bump might have been observed for @xmath102 days after the burst .",

    "we assume that a bi - polar relativistic jet is launched when the mass of the central bh becomes @xmath104 .",
