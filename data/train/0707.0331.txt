    "we know that the study of bloom - gilman quark - hadron duality is essential to understand the physics behind the connection between perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and non - perturbative qcd [ 1 ] . in 2000 , the new evidence of valence - like quark - hadron duality in the nucleon unpolarized structure functions @xmath2 was reported by jefferson lab . [ 2 ] . the well - known bloom - gilman quark - hadron duality [ 3 ]",
    "tells that prominent resonances do not disappear relatively to the background even at a large @xmath3 .",
    "it also means that the average of the oscillate resonance peaks in the resonance region is the same as the scaling structure function at a large @xmath3 value .",
    "the origin of the bloom - gilman quark - hadron duality has been discussed by rujula , georgi and politzer [ 4 ] with a qcd explanation . according to operator production expansion ( ope ) , it is argued that higher - twist effects turn to be small in the integral of the structure functions , and therefore , the leading - twist plays a dominate role to the moments of the nucleon structure functions [ 4 ] .",
    "so far , the nucleon structure functions and the higher - twist effects have already been carefully and systemically studied [ 5 ] .",
    "some detailed calculations for the higher - twist effects were carried out based on various theoretical approaches , like bag model [ 6 ] , qcd sum rule [ 7 - 8 ] , constituent quark model [ 9 ] , lattice qcd [ 10 ] , and chiral soliton model [ 11 ] .",
    "moreover , there are also several empirical analyses of the spin structure functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 at low @xmath3 .",
    "the higher - twist effects , like the ones of the twist-3 and twist-4 terms , have been extracted from the data [ 12 - 16 ] .",
    "those analyses can be more and more accurate because more and more precisely new measurements of the nucleon spin structure functions of @xmath4 [ 17 - 19 ] , and particularly of @xmath5 [ 15,16,20 ] , are available .",
    "+ usually , the contribution of the twist-3 @xmath1 is extracted from the measured @xmath6 by calculating the moment of @xmath7 we know that the first moment of @xmath4 can be generally expanded in inverse powers of @xmath3 in ope [ 5 ] .",
    "it is @xmath8 with the coefficients @xmath9 related to the nucleon matrix elements of the operators of twist @xmath10 . in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the leading - twist ( twist-2 ) component @xmath11 is determined by the matrix elements of the axial vector operator @xmath12 , summed over various quark flavors .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath13 term contains the contributions from the twist-2 @xmath14 , twist-3 @xmath1 , and twist-4 @xmath15 , respectively . thus [ 5 ] , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the nucleon mass . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath14 arises from the target mass corrections , and it is of purely kinematical origin .",
    "it relates to the third moment of the twist-2 part of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the other higher - twist terms , like @xmath1 and @xmath15 , result from the reduced matrix elements , which are of the dynamical origin since they show the correlations among the partons [ 7,21 ] . if the contribution of the twist-3 term is well defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , then the contribution of the twist-4 term , like @xmath15 , can be extracted according to eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "+ it should be mentioned that the method of eq . ( 1 ) to extract the twist-3 contribution @xmath1 ignores the target mass corrections to @xmath0 , since the relations @xmath20 are used . in general , the nucleon target mass corrections should be considered completely in the studies of the nucleon structure functions [ 22 ] , of the bloom - gilman quark - hadron duality [ 23 - 25 ] , and of the bjorken sum rule [ 26 ] at a moderate low @xmath21 ) .",
    "we know that the target mass corrections to the nucleon structure functions are of the pure kinematical origin .",
    "they are different from the other higher - twist effects from dynamical multi - gluon exchanges or parton correlations . before one can extract the higher - twist effects , it is important to remove the target mass corrections from the data [ 24 ] .",
    "there were several works about the target mass corrections to @xmath22 and @xmath6 in the literature [ 27 - 29 ] .",
    "recently , the expressions of all the electromagnetic and electroweak nucleon spin structure functions with the target mass corrections have been explicitly given in refs .",
    "[ 30 - 31 ] .",
    "+ in this work , in order to precisely extract the contribution of the twist-3 operators , the target mass corrections to eq .",
    "( 1 ) will be discussed . in section 2",
    ", we explicitly give the target mass corrections to the integral @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the advantage of the nachtmann moments is stressed . in section 3 , the numerical estimate of the target mass corrections to @xmath23 is given comparing to the result of the nachtmann moment .",
    "the last section is devoted for conclusions .",
    "here , we use the notations of piccione and ridolfi [ 30 ] for the spin structure functions and for their moments . we know that the well - known cornwall - norton ( cn ) moments are @xmath24 in refs .",
    "[ 30 - 31 ] , the target mass corrections to the nucleon spin structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are explicitly given in terms of the cn moments of the matrix elements of the twist-2 ( leading - twist ) operator and twist-3 one .",
    "up to twist-3 , the results are @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the reduced hadron matrix elements of the irreducible lorentz operators [ 29 - 30 ] : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the matrix elements of the operators : @xmath30 ( twist-2 ) and @xmath31 ( twist-3 ) can be written as [ 29 - 30 ] @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the general rank - n symmetric tensor which can be formed with one spin four - vector @xmath35 and @xmath36 momentum four - vectors @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is antisymmetric in @xmath39 , symmetric in all other indices .",
    "the two tensors must be traceless .",
    "a typical example for a twist-3 operator is @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes symmetrizing the indices and subtracting the trace , and @xmath42 is the dual gluon field strength [ 6 - 7 ] .",
    "we notice that the contribution of the leading - twist terms has a relation to the quark distributions functions",
    ". however , the contributions of the higher - twist operators ( like twist-3 ) have no partonic interpretation [ 31 ] . in eq .",
    "( 5 ) if we fix @xmath43 , then , @xmath44 comparing to eqs .",
    "( 2 - 3 ) , we see that @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) only the contributions of the leading - twist and twist-3 operators are considered .",
    "+ from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 - 6 ) , we see that @xmath47 clearly , @xmath23 contains the target mass corrections .",
    "it has mixed contributions from other higher - spin and twist-3 terms except for @xmath48(or @xmath1 ) .",
    "+ to get the twist-3 contribution of an operator with a definite spin , we need to consider the nachtmann moments .",
    "according to ref . [ 29 ] , the two nachtmann moments of the spin structure functions are defined as @xmath49g_1(x , q^2)\\nonumber \\\\ & -&y^2x^2\\frac{4n}{n+2}g_2(x , q^2)\\bigg \\ } ,   ~~(n=1,3,5, ... ),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath50g_2(x , q^2)\\bigg   \\ } , ~~(n=3,5, ... ),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nachtmann variable is [ 28 ] @xmath51 clearly , the two nachtmann moments are simultaneously constructed by using the two spin structure functions @xmath0 . according to eqs .",
    "( 5 - 6 ) , one can expand the two nachtmann moments up to the order of @xmath52 as @xmath53 eq .",
    "( 15 ) explicitly tells that , different from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 11 ) , one can get the contributions of the pure twist-2 with spin - n and the pure twist-3 with spin-(n-1 ) operators from the nachtmann moments .",
    "the above conclusion is valid when the target mass corrections are included .",
    "if the target mass corrections vanish , then eq . ( 11 ) turns to be @xmath1 .",
    "the advantage of the nachtmann moments , then , means that they contain only dynamical higher - twist effects , which are the ones related to the correlations among the partons . as a result",
    ", one sees that the nachtmann moments are constructed to protect the moments of the nucleon structure functions from the target mass corrections .",
    "it is clear that the nachtmann moments relate to the dynamical matrix elements of the operators with the definite twist and definite spin [ 17,21,24 ] .",
    "one may estimate the target mass corrections to the contribution of the twist-3 @xmath46 .",
    "we note that the nucleon spin structure functions are @xmath54 } { 2x[1+r_{\\sigma}(x , q^2)]},\\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_2(x , q^2)&=&\\frac{f_2(x , q^2)[-a_1(x , q^2)+a_2(x , q^2)/\\gamma ] } { 2x[1+r_{\\sigma}(x , q^2)]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the unpolarized structure function , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse virtual photon cross sections . in eq .",
    "( 16 ) , @xmath58 are the virtual photon asymmetry parameters . to analyze the target mass corrections to the contribution of the twist-3 @xmath46 numerically",
    ", we simply employ the empirical parameterization forms of @xmath59 [ 16,18 ] , of @xmath60 [ 32 ] , of @xmath2 [ 33 ] , and of the average data of @xmath61 [ 20 ] . here , we stress that the well - known wandzura and wilczek ( ww ) relation [ 34 ] for @xmath5 @xmath62 is valid [ 30 - 31 ] if only the leading - twist is considered .",
    "the target mass corrections to the twist-2 contribution do not break the ww relation .",
    "if the higher - twist operators , like twist-3 , are considered , the ww relation @xmath63 is no longer valid .",
    "thus , according to ref . [ 20 ] , one may write @xmath64 clearly , if only the twist-2 term is considered , @xmath65 . the non - vanishing value of @xmath66 results from the higher - twist effects . in ref .",
    "[ 20 ] , the average data of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are listed for the measured values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the measured ranges of the experiment are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "it is argued that @xmath73 is independent of @xmath3 in the measured region since @xmath74 depends only logarithmically on @xmath3 [ 5 ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath3-dependence of the structure function @xmath75 mainly results from @xmath76 [ 20 ] .",
    "another point made by e155 collaboration [ 20 ] is that the contributions of @xmath66 to the integral of eq .",
    "( 1 ) beyond the measured @xmath77 region , say @xmath78 and @xmath79 , are negligible .",
    "+ based on the above two arguments of ref .",
    "[ 20 ] , we calculate the ratio @xmath80 of the nachtmann moment to the value of eq . ( 1 ) @xmath81 for the proton and neutron spin structure functions , respectively . for the neutron structure function ,",
    "we simple use the relation @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the deuteron d - state probability .",
    "it should be mentioned that the target mass corrections to the deuteron ( spin one ) structure fucntions have been discussed in ref . [ 35 ] .",
    "it is found that the target mass corrections to @xmath84 and @xmath85 are precisely the same as in the spin-1/2 targets .",
    "the calculated results of @xmath80 are plotted in fig .",
    "clearly , the divergence of the two ratios from unity displays the target mass corrections . from fig .",
    "1 we see a sizeable role played by the target mass corrections .",
    "when the momentum transfer @xmath3 becomes small , the role increases obviously .",
    "the effect of the target mass corrections is about 30% for the average of the proton and neutron targets when @xmath86 .",
    "it decreases to about 10% when @xmath87 .",
    "we find that the values of the nachtmann moment @xmath88 , which contains no target mass corrections , are always smaller than those of @xmath23 which has the target mass corrections .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contribution of the twist-3 @xmath1 to the nucleon structure function extracted from eq .",
    "( 1 ) is overestimated .",
    "for example , at an average @xmath3 of @xmath89 of the e155 experiment [ 20 ] , the estimated @xmath90 from experiment data and eq .",
    "if the target mass corrections are taken into account , the central value of @xmath91 is reduced to about @xmath92 .",
    "this new value becomes even close to zero .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "1 shows that the ratio of the neutron is similar to that of the proton , and the target mass corrections to the neutron is only a little bit smaller than those to the proton .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties of @xmath1 in ref . [ 20 ] come from the statistical and systematic errors on measured @xmath93 . at a low @xmath3 value , say , @xmath94 , the measured @xmath95 is @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath3 increases to about @xmath97 , the measured @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , the errors on @xmath1 caused by the uncertainties of @xmath93 are much larger than the target mass corrections in our calculation . +    .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are the results of the proton and neutron , respectively .",
    ", width=384,height=288 ]",
    "in summary , we have explicitly shown the target mass corrections to the contribution of twist-3 extracted from eq .",
    "it is clear that the nachtmann moments are constructed by the two spin structure functions and do not governed by the target mass corrections .",
    "therefore , in order to precisely extract the contribution of the twist-3 @xmath1 at different @xmath3 values , one is required to employ the nachtmann moment @xmath88 .",
    "the numerical estimate ratios @xmath80 for the proton and neutron in fig . 1 indicate that the target mass corrections play a sizeable role to the integral of eq .",
    "thus , the equation gives the result which is different from the pure contribution of the twist-3 @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath1 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) are always overestimated because @xmath23 contains the mixed contributions of other twist-3 terms with higher - spin , except for @xmath48 ( or @xmath1 ) .",
    "numerically , the effect of the target mass corrections in the extracted @xmath1 ( or @xmath48 ) from eq .",
    "( 1 ) is about 30% for the average of the proton and neutron targets when @xmath99 or about 10% when @xmath87 .",
    "the corrections to the neutron are similar to those to the proton . as a result",
    ", we expect that one should take the nachtmann moment to precisely extract the contribution of twist-3 operator @xmath1 . with a very accurate value of @xmath1",
    ", one may further get the precise information of the other higher - twist operators , like twist-4 term @xmath100 . since the errors of the present data of @xmath101 are large , the uncertainties of the extracted values of @xmath102 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) are larger than the target mass corrections . a much more precise measurement of @xmath5 and @xmath103 is urgently required",
