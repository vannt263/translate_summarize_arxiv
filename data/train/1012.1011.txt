    "since the fundamental suggestion made by anderson in 1987 , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0 model ( @xmath1 m ) has been regarded as an effective hamiltonian description of the basic properties of the superconducting copper oxides.@xcite essential physical features of the insulating copper - oxide planes of these compounds are successfully reproduced by the spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( ahm),@xcite to which the @xmath1 m reduces when holes are absent . on the other hand , such insulating planes can turn superconducting if doped with mobile holes , whose presence is accounted for in the @xmath1 m by adding to the ahm a nearest - neighbor hole - hopping term .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 hamiltonian is @xmath3 where the summations run over nearest - neighbor sites on the square lattice , @xmath4 is the hole hopping amplitude , and @xmath5 the antiferromagnetic coupling between site @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 creates an electron , at site @xmath6 , of spin projection ( e.g. , along the @xmath9 axis ) @xmath10 avoiding double occupancy .",
    "therefore , in terms of the usual fermionic creation operator @xmath11 ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , are the spin-@xmath2 and the number operator respectively .    despite the simple form of the above hamiltonian , its study constitutes , even in presence of a single hole , a very difficult problem .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) , possible only for small system sizes ( i.e. , up to @xmath15 sites),@xcite approximated analytical treatments,@xcite as well as numerical approaches of various type,@xcite have been largely employed to gain insight into the physics of the one - hole @xmath1 m .",
    "specifically , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques based on imaginary time projection furnish , even for large systems , accurate ( exact in principle ) results at half filling ( i.e. , no - hole case ) or for @xmath4=0 ( i.e. , static - hole case).@xcite however , when @xmath16 these methods are affected by the sign problem , for which only essentially uncontrolled workarounds ( e.g. , fixed - node approximation ) exist .",
    "furthermore , being a 2d one , the model of our interest can not be tackled , due to the unfavorable scaling of the required computational resources , by using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite the accepted method of choice for 1d lattice models .",
    "variational monte carlo ( vmc ) schemes do not suffer from the sign problem ; on the other hand they are not strictly exact , their accuracy depending on the particular choice of the trial wave function ( wf ) . for the @xmath1 m with a single hole , specific",
    "variational wf s @xcite have been designed affording estimates of the hole dispersion relation in reasonable agreement with those , generally more accurate , obtained by qmc .",
    "recently , the suggestion was made of combining dmrg and monte carlo in order to design novel variational algorithms for tensor - network based ansatze applicable to systems of spatial dimension higher than one.@xcite the wf introduced by us,@xcite founded on entangled - plaquette states ( eps ) , has been successfully employed to study ground - state ( gs ) properties of lattice spin models with open or periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "such ansatz has been proven to yield estimates of physical observables of accuracy at least comparable to that obtainable with the best alternative techniques or trial wfs.@xcite the eps wf can be efficiently optimized for plaquettes of a given size , as well as systematically improved by adding more plaquettes and/or increasing their size.@xcite    in this paper we apply the eps ansatz to investigate the dynamics of a hole in a quantum antiferromagnet described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "specifically , we compute the hole energy dispersion curve @xmath17 , as well as the spectral weight of the quasi - hole state , for lattice sizes up to @xmath18 sites in the parameter - range @xmath19 ( the @xmath1 m is believed to be relevant to the cuprate superconductors for a value of @xmath20 ) . from the methodological standpoint , this study is considerably more challenging than that of the various ( un)frustrated spin models to which the eps ansatz has been recently applied with success.@xcite    the main goal of this work is to demonstrate the accuracy of the eps wf in describing the property of a mobile hole in the @xmath1 m .",
    "this is achieved by a systematic comparison of our results for the energy dispersion curve and the hole spectral weight with estimates computed by different approaches .",
    "furthermore , besides the mentioned methodological aspects we offer extremely accurate results for the hole spectral weight in the so called `` physical region '' ( i.e.,@xmath21 ) where the accuracy of qmc data , the most reliable ones obtained so far , becomes less satisfactory.@xcite assessing the reliability of the eps ansatz in a case ( i.e. , the @xmath1 m with one mobile hole ) for which a large number of results obtained with alternative trial states , or other methodologies are available in literature , is a fundamental step also in view of future applications of our wf to the long - standing problem of understanding the phase diagram of the @xmath1 m at finite hole concentration .",
    "the accuracy of the estimates presented here is clearly not a proof of the reliability of our variational choice when more holes are present , it constitutes , however , the necessary condition to consider the eps wf , with no need of essential adjustments , a promising option for the investigation of the finite hole concentration scenario .",
    "a direct study of the latter problem , given the paucity of reliable results obtained in the past , would render the assessment of the trustability of our ansatz problematic leaving , on the other hand , room for dubitative , definitely well - posed , questions such as : _ why results at finite hole concentration should be taken seriously if the reliability of the eps wf has not even been proved in the simpler single hole case ? _    on using a minimal eps ansatz based on @xmath22 @xmath23 entangled plaquettes , we obtain estimates of the hole dispersion curve in qualitative and semi - quantitative agreement with those computed by qmc .",
    "we achieve quantitative agreement , also for other observables , with an eps wf based on plaquettes comprising @xmath24 lattice sites .",
    "the accuracy of our findings for one hole confirms the flexibility of the eps ansatz , which can be applied with no substantial modifications to a large class of lattice models .",
    "more importantly , the eps wf used in this work is easily generalizable to the case of a finite hole concentration , where the sign problem renders qmc inapplicable , and the generalization of different trial states employed for one or two holes appears quite complicated.@xcite",
    "let us consider a square lattice of @xmath22 sites comprising one electron per site , a generic wf can be written as @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the eigenvalue of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the weight of a configuration of the system . the eps ansatz is constructed as follows :    \\i ) cover the systems with @xmath30 plaquettes in such a way that @xmath31 sites labelled by @xmath32 belong to the @xmath33 plaquette .",
    "\\ii ) express the weight of a global spin configuration as a product of variational coefficients @xmath34 in biunivocal correspondence to the particular configuration ( e.g. , spin state along the @xmath9 axis of the plaquette sites ) of the plaquettes .",
    "hence , taking into account explicitly the bipartite nature of the spin-@xmath2 square heisenberg antiferromagnet at half filling : @xmath35 being @xmath36 , according to the marshall - sign rule , the number of `` down '' spins in one of the two sublattices@xcite and @xmath37 the crucial part of the ansatz .",
    "analogously , in presence of a single hole , our eps wf is defined via @xmath38 here @xmath39 refers to the generic configuration containing one hole and @xmath40 electrons , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the hole momentum and the spatial position of the empty site respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the trial states adopted in this work naturally incorporate , for plaquettes including more than one site , electron - electron as well as electron - hole correlations .",
    "we estimate gs energies of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) via variational optimization of the states ( [ coeffh ] ) at half filling and ( [ coeffk ] ) in presence of a single hole .",
    "independent optimizations are carried on for each @xmath41 value by monte carlo sampling both the energy and its derivatives with respect to the varational parameters ( i.e. , the @xmath43 s ) .",
    "further details concerning the variational family of eps and the numerical technique adopted to minimize the energy are given in refs . and .",
    "although the eps ansatz is exact when a single plaquette as large as the system is employed , accurate results are already obtainable by using @xmath22 entangled ( i.e. , overlapping ) plaquettes comprising @xmath44 sites , the accuracy of the estimates being sensibly improvable increasing the plaquette size .",
    "specifically , we compute the hole energy dispersion curve @xmath45 defined by the difference between the @xmath46-dependent gs energy of the one - hole @xmath1 m and that of the ahm , and the hole spectral weight @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the normalized gs of the one ( zero ) -hole system .    we compare the eps results with exact ones for a @xmath50 lattice and with the most accurate available in literature , for larger systems . in this case",
    "the main features of the hole dispersion relation , namely the characteristic shape with a global minimum at @xmath51 and a nearly flat region around @xmath52 , are very well reproduced with an ansatz based on @xmath53 plaquettes , while the increasing of the plaquette size to @xmath54 gives rise to an approximately rigid shift , towards lower energies , of the band and an almost perfect agreement ( not reachable , to our knowledge , with other variational wf s ) with previous qmc studies for all the @xmath55 values considered in this work .",
    "moreover , with the @xmath54 eps , accurate estimates of the hole spectral weight are obtained , on the same footing , via the monte carlo method .",
    "the gs energies of the one - hole @xmath1 m on a @xmath50 lattice can be obtained , given the small system size , by using a single plaquette comprising all the lattice sites . in this case the eps ansatz is exact , the error bar of our estimates being only due to the limited number of configurations sampled , and reproduces , as expected , ed results.@xcite    clearly , for larger systems , the use of a single plaquette is not feasible , therefore , it is important to asses the accuracy of our wf for smaller plaquette size .",
    "the error relative to the exact result : @xmath56 of our estimate of the global energy minimum at @xmath57 is @xmath58% for the @xmath53 eps ansatz , decreasing down to less than @xmath59% when @xmath54 plaquettes are used . for this plaquette size ,",
    "our results compare favorably to those obtained with different trial states , even when larger lattices are considered .",
    "for example , the eps energy when @xmath51 on a @xmath60 lattice at @xmath61 is @xmath62 , while the wf including both spin - spin and momentum dependent spin - hole correlations adopted in ref .",
    "yields a value of @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath64% higher ) .",
    "sites with pbc at @xmath65 .",
    "eps estimates ( triangles ) are computed using square plaquettes of 9 sites .",
    "qmc results ( crosses ) are also shown for comparison.@xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]     sites with pbc at @xmath66 .",
    "eps estimates ( triangles ) are computed using square plaquettes of 9 sites .",
    "qmc results ( crosses ) are also shown for comparison.@xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]     sites with pbc at @xmath61 . eps estimates are computed using square plaquettes of 4 ( circles ) or 9 ( triangles ) sites .",
    "gfmc results ( crosses)@xcite are also shown for comparison.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as opposed to the case in which more holes are present and the sign problem is particularly severe , qmc techniques based on imaginary time projection , for the one - hole @xmath1 m , provide extremely accurate results , to our knowledge the most accurate in literature , when , due to the large system size , the ed of the hamiltonian is not possible .",
    "hence , a comparison of the eps wf against these approaches is in order .    the hole energy dispersion curve , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the @xmath67 lattice at @xmath65 .",
    "our estimates ( triangles ) , computed with the @xmath54 eps ansatz , are indistinguishable ( taking into account the error bars ) from available qmc ones@xcite ( crosses ) .",
    "around @xmath68 the curve is nearly flat , in agreement with other studies.@xcite it has to be mentioned that the degeneracy observed on the @xmath50 lattice between @xmath69 and @xmath70 is due to geometrical reasons@xcite and is no longer present when the lattice size increases .",
    "the hole dispersion relation for lower values of @xmath55 is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the main qualitative features of the curve ( e.g. , the position of the minimum ) appear independent of the value of @xmath55 .",
    "to illustrate further the accuracy of the eps wf , estimates of @xmath71 obtained with @xmath53 plaquettes ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) are also shown for @xmath72 . despite the relatively small number of variational coefficients utilized for this ansatz , the resulting dispersion relation is in close agreement with that found with @xmath54 plaquettes as well as with green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) results@xcite ( triangles and crosses respectively in the same figure ) and qmc ones.@xcite specifically , the hole band predicted by using such a minimal eps ansatz differs from the more accurate prediction achievable with @xmath54 plaquettes only by a rigid energy shift towards lower energy values .",
    "this energy shift ( albeit quantitatively different ) occurs for all the three values of @xmath55 considered here , pointing out how the eps ansatz , even in its simplest and economical implementation ( i.e. , when @xmath53 plaquettes are used ) , can provide reliable estimates of observable such as the effective mass , the band width , and generally all those obtainable from band energy differences .",
