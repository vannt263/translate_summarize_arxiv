    "in the absence of any clear deviation from the standard model ( sm ) predictions , considerable work has been done recently to search for processes that are forbidden or highly suppressed and may become a good playground to test any new physics lying beyond the sm .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath3 is a good example of this type of processes because it arises at the one  loop level in the sm .",
    "the l3 collaboration has searched for energetic photon events coming from single ",
    "photon @xmath1 decays .",
    "it was obtained a bound of one part in a million for the respective branching ratio @xcite .",
    "single photon events in @xmath1 decays have been associated to gauge boson and leptonic substructure @xcite , supersymmetric particles @xcite , a possible neutrino magnetic moment @xcite and the production of a higgs boson with its associated cp ",
    "odd majoron @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath4 is expected also to be sensitive to the possible anomalous electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 boson and the neutrinos .",
    "the latter point has become of increased interest after the recent evidence of oscillations in atmospheric neutrinos @xcite . in a recent study of the decay @xmath3 within the effective lagrangian approach @xcite ,",
    "the l3 bound was used to get direct constraints on dimension  six and dimension  eight operators associated with the anomalous electromagnetic properties of the neutrino . + though there is a great incentive in studying single ",
    "photon @xmath1 decays , to our knowledge its decay width has not been computed in the sm .",
    "we would like to stress that in order to disentangle new contributions to this process , it is important to count with a complete analysis of the sm contributions .",
    "our general aim is precisely to present explicit expressions of a calculation of the sm decay @xmath3 at lowest order in perturbation theory .",
    "as we will see below , the amplitude for this process can be written in terms of five independent @xmath5 gauge structures .",
    "some of them can be identified in terms of the so  called off  shell electromagnetic properties of the @xmath1 gauge boson and the neutrino .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath1 boson possesses both an anapole moment ( am ) and an electric dipole transition ( edt ) defined through the @xmath6 and @xmath7 couplings , respectively ( where @xmath8 stands for off  shell particles ) @xcite .",
    "a sm neutrino can have only off ",
    "shell electromagnetic properties characterized by the @xmath9 and @xmath10 couplings .",
    "the @xmath9 coupling corresponds to an am of the neutrino , which has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "it will be seen below that the @xmath10 coupling can be identified with a magnetic dipole transition ( mdt ) of the neutrino . in this paper",
    "we have found that the main contributions to the decay @xmath3 come precisely from the mdt and edt properties of the neutrino and the @xmath1 boson , respectively .",
    "in particular , the mdt of the neutrino plays an important role in this process .",
    "therefore , we will discuss with some extent its @xmath11 structure .",
    "for this purpose we will use a nonlinear gauge which allows us to separate in a transparent way the @xmath11 and @xmath5 gauge structures and , as a consequence , it will simplify considerably the calculation .",
    "in particular , we have found that there is no @xmath11 gauge link between the @xmath10 coupling and the box diagrams contributing to the decay .",
    "this result should be contrasted with the situation found in the calculation of the sm scattering amplitude of neutrinos with charged leptons and nucleons . in this case , the @xmath11 gauge structure of the @xmath9 coupling is directly linked to the box diagrams contributing to the scattering process @xcite .",
    "+ in the nonlinear gauge the decay @xmath3 receives contributions from reducible triangle diagrams characterized by the @xmath7 and @xmath10 couplings , as well as from box diagrams containing @xmath12 boson and lepton combined effects .",
    "it is well known that in many four  body processes the box diagrams contributions can be neglected compared with the triangle ones . however , this approximation fails when the triangle and box diagrams possess common @xmath5 gauge structures which induce form factors of the same order of magnitude . in particular , the tensor structures arising from the box diagrams will have a lorentz covariant decomposition inducing the mdt of the neutrino .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to neglect the box diagram contributions in the decay @xmath3 .",
    "our numerical result confirms that this decay is a sm highly suppressed process , about four orders of magnitude below the l3 bound @xcite .",
    "thus it leaves open a window to search for new physics effects in single ",
    "photon events , mainly in the neutrino sector .",
    "+ we have organized our presentation in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ cal ] we present the analytic expressions for the @xmath3 decay width . in sec .",
    "[ num ] we give details of the numerical analysis , and the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the decay @xmath3 is a sm one  loop prediction which receives contributions from all charged particles . within the conventional linear gauge",
    ", we can classify in five sets the feynman diagrams contributing to this decay at the one  loop level .",
    "the first three sets are characterized by reducible diagrams including the @xmath13 mixing term ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and the @xmath14 and @xmath15 couplings ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively ) , while the other two sets include box diagrams where the @xmath1 boson couples to charged leptons ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and to @xmath12 bosons ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . for the purpose of our calculation ,",
    "it is suitable using a nonlinear gauge in which there is no @xmath11 gauge ( nor @xmath5 gauge ) link between the @xmath10 coupling and the box diagrams .",
    "this task is a difficult one to fulfill in a linear gauge , where @xmath11 gauge independence and @xmath5 gauge invariance are only accomplished after adding up almost all the feynman diagrams involved in the calculation .",
    "furthermore , in this type of gauges a renormalization of the @xmath13 mixing term has to be done @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it can be shown that in the nonlinear gauge the amplitude for this mixing term vanishes for any value of the @xmath11 gauge parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we will show also that the @xmath10 coupling is by itself @xmath11 gauge independent and @xmath5 gauge invariant . + a nonlinear @xmath17gauge condition",

    "the @xmath12 boson and the charged ghosts sectors are separately @xmath5 gauge invariant , leading to naive ward identities .",
    "this procedure was later extended to remove both @xmath18 and @xmath20 vertices @xcite .",

    "we have made this task in different ways to get a reliable answer . in the case of the @xmath7 and @xmath10 couplings contributions ,",
    "we get simple analytical solutions for the corresponding amplitudes , so we programmed the required integrals in mathematica @xcite and fortran language together with the ff package .",

    "first , the @xmath10 coupling contribution to the decay width @xmath158 is @xmath159 gev . on the other hand",
    ", in the case of the @xmath14 coupling only the top quark family gives an important contribution , namely @xmath160 gev , while the remaining contributions are negligible small .",
    "this fact can be understood because the @xmath7 coupling contributions have a strong dependence on the mass gap existing in each fermion family .",
    "in particular , an exact mass degeneration implies a zero contribution .",
    "this nondecoupling effect of chiral fermions is well known in the sm and it is due to isospin breaking .",
    "this constitutes an important effect in radiative corrections proportional to @xmath161 . in the same footing",
    ", it is interesting to study a possible enhancement for the @xmath7 amplitude arising from a fourth family of chiral fermions with sm assignment of quantum numbers .",
    "the most promising scenario arises from a heavy top  like quark with a light bottom  like quark and a light tau  like lepton . in order to give an estimation of this contribution ,",
    "we have used the lep1 lower bounds for the tau  like lepton and the bottom  like quark : @xmath162 gev and @xmath163 gev ; also , a variation of @xmath164 in the 300850 gev range is assumed , where the upper limit for the top  like quark mass was taken from the @xmath165 constraint over the fourth family mass difference @xcite . the corresponding contribution , as a function of @xmath166 shows an enhancement of almost 5 times with respect to the third family contribution , this enhancement is rapidly reached at @xmath167 gev .",
    "finally , in the case of the box diagrams as well as the interference terms , their contribution is of the same order as that coming from the @xmath10 coupling .",
    "we have found that the main contribution of the box diagrams arises from the @xmath5 gauge structure corresponding to the neutrino mdt , whereas the @xmath5 gauge structures given in ( [ eqgs ] ) lead to a contribution of order @xmath168@xmath169 gev .",
    "+ in summary , considering all the terms in ( [ eqw ] ) and assuming lepton universality we have @xmath170 for the three sm neutrino species .",
    "the main contribution comes from the neutrino mdt @xmath5 gauge structure , while the @xmath1 boson edt contribution is two orders of magnitude below .",
    "we have presented a complete calculation of the sm decay @xmath109 using a nonlinear gauge .",
    "we have found that this decay is characterized by the off  shell electromagnetic properties of the neutrino and the @xmath1 boson : a neutrino mdt and a @xmath1 boson edt induced by the @xmath10 and the @xmath7 couplings , respectively .",
    "we found that the @xmath1 boson edt contribution may be enhanced by a fourth generation of chiral fermions ; however , this effect is not enough to increase significantly @xmath171 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the main contribution to the decay @xmath3 arises from the neutrino mdt .",
    "this contribution depends strongly on the momentum transferred by the @xmath1 boson but it is not sensitive to a possible neutrino mass .",
    "another interesting fact found in our calculation is that the box diagrams contributions can not be neglected because they induce a neutrino mdt @xmath5 gauge structure with a form factor of the same order of magnitude as that coming from the @xmath10 coupling .",
    "it is important to notice that this is true even though there is no @xmath11 nor @xmath5 gauge link between the @xmath10 and box diagrams .",
    "this scenario was foreseen in a recent study of the decay @xmath3 within the effective lagrangian approach @xcite : the operators inducing the @xmath7 coupling are suppressed with respect to the dimension  six and dimension  eight operators inducing the @xmath10 coupling and the box diagram contributions .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the dimension  six and dimension  eight operators contribute substantially to @xmath171 ) , as it was the case in our calculation . finally , we would like to point out that the decay @xmath0 leads to a branching ratio of the same order of magnitude than the one expected for the radiative decay @xmath172 @xcite . in this case , the experimental bound for the respective branching ratio is also about four orders of magnitude below the sm prediction",
    ". therefore , these decay modes of the @xmath1 boson should be of interest for people searching for deviations coming from new physics effects . +",
