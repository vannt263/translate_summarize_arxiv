    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) for mesons @xcite has been highly successful in describing the strong interactions of the pseudoscalar meson octet in the low - energy regime ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . the prerequisite for its success",
    "has been a consistent power counting establishing a straightforward connection between the loop expansion and the chiral expansion in terms of quark masses and small external four - momenta at a fixed ratio .",
    "state - of - the - art calculations have reached the next - to - next - to - leading , i  e , two - loop order accuracy @xcite . in general , due to the relatively large mass of the strange quark , the convergence in the three - flavour sector is somewhat slower in comparison with the two - flavour sector .",
    "the extension to processes including one ground state baryon in the initial and final states was performed in @xcite .",
    "it was found that , when applying the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath0 ) scheme of chpt @xcite , i  e , the same renormalization condition as in the mesonic sector , higher - loop diagrams can contribute to terms as low as @xmath1 in the chiral expansion , where @xmath2 denotes a small external momentum or a goldstone boson mass .",
    "hence , the correspondence between the loop and chiral expansions seemed to be lost .",
    "this problem was eluded in the framework of the heavy - baryon formulation of chpt @xcite , resulting in a power counting analogous to the mesonic sector .",
    "the price one pays for giving up manifest lorentz invariance of the lagrangian consists of a ) an increasing complexity of the effective lagrangian due to @xmath3 corrections and b ) the fact that not all of the scattering amplitudes , evaluated perturbatively in the heavy - baryon framework , show the correct analytical behaviour in the low - energy region .",
    "recently , several methods have been devised to restore a consistent power counting in a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the so - called extended on - mass - shell ( eoms ) renormalization scheme of @xcite which provides a simple and consistent power counting for the renormalized diagrams of manifestly lorentz - invariant chpt .",
    "the method makes use of finite subtractions of dimensionally regularized diagrams beyond the standard modified minimal subtraction scheme of chpt to remove contributions violating the power counting .",
    "this is achieved by choosing a suitable renormalization of the parameters of the most general effective lagrangian .",
    "so far the new method has been applied in the two - flavour sector to a calculation of the nucleon mass @xcite , the electromagnetic form factors @xcite , the sigma term and the scalar form factor @xcite . moreover",
    ", the eoms approach allows one to consistently include vector mesons as explicit degrees of freedom @xcite and to reformulate the infrared renormalization of becher and leutwyler @xcite so that it may also be applied to multiloop diagrams @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the application of the eoms scheme to a calculation of the baryon octet masses in the framework of three - flavor chpt .",
    "we will also discuss various nucleon sigma terms .",
    "in this section we will briefly specify those elements of the effective lagrangian in the three - flavour sector which are relevant for the discussion of the baryon masses and the nucleon sigma terms .",
    "we will not need to consider external fields except for the ( constant ) quark masses , because the sigma terms will be derived from the baryon masses using the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite .",
