    "many body systems are typically modeled by global hamiltonians that are sums of local interaction terms .",
    "frustration characterizes those situations for which it is impossible to satisfy simultaneously the minimization of all local interaction energies in the presence of the global constraint that imposes minimization of the total many - body energy  @xcite .    in interacting many - body systems frustration",
    "may be due either to complex geometrical configurations and/or competing interactions .",
    "these types of frustration are _ generic _ in that they are common to both classical and quantum systems alike . on the other hand quantum systems , due to the non - commutativity of different local hamiltonians ,",
    "may feature further , _ genuine quantum _ , sources of frustration with no classical counterpart  @xcite .",
    "in particular , quantum counterparts of classically unfrustrated systems can be frustrated  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for many - body quantum systems , a universal measure of total frustration encompassing all possible sources , generic and specifically quantum , should quantify the degree of incompatibility between global and local ground states associated , respectively , to the total many - body hamiltonian and to the local interaction terms .",
    "such a measure has recently been introduced , in refs .",
    "@xcite , exactly in terms of the overlap between the ground states of local interactions and the local reduced states obtained by partial trace from the global ground state of the total many - body hamiltonian .",
    "it provides a unified treatment of both generic and specifically quantum contributions to the total frustration of local interaction terms .",
    "quantum frustration is then singled out by the existence of a quantum lower bound to the total frustration that is realized in terms of the ground - state entanglement between the local interacting subsystem and the remainder of the total many - body system .    in the present work",
    "we first show how frustration relates not only to the global block entanglement across a bipartition of the total many - body system but also to the local entanglement among the constituents of the individual interaction terms .",
    "next , we show how these relations rule quantitatively the onset of ground - state dimerization and the formation of valence bond solids . for many - body hamiltonians sums of two - body terms ,",
    "the local interacting pairs are naturally identified as the elementary subsystems .",
    "we deduce a direct relation between quantum frustration of local pairs and the pair entanglement as measured by the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "herewith we are able to establish a relation between quantum frustration and entanglement monogamy  @xcite which imposes a strong constraint , without classical counterpart , on the shareability of quantum correlations . specifically , we investigate the interplay between generic and quantum frustration for an ample class of spin@xmath0 models with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - to - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions .",
    "these models feature both quantum frustration due to the non - commutativity of the different local interaction terms and generic frustration due to competing interactions on different length scales .",
    "we show that ground - state dimerization in these systems is realized exactly at the transition from generic to quantum frustration , i.e. at values of the hamiltonian parameters for which the total frustration becomes entirely due to the ground - state block entanglement .",
    "remarkably , such models are amenable to quantum simulation with systems of trapped ions  @xcite , ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , coupled cavity arrays  @xcite , superconducting qubits  @xcite , or nuclear magnetic resonance simulators  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as we will show in the following , changes in the ground - state patterns caused by changes in the frustration properties can be experimentally observed , e.g. in optical - lattice realizations , by measuring the quasi momentum distribution as quantified by the static structure factor  @xcite , or the interferometric visibility  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_frustration ]",
    "we introduce the universal measure of total frustration in terms of the global - to - local infidelity and describe its main features . in section  [ sec : entanglement ] we consider generic spin1/2 models with pairwise interactions on different length scales , discuss their frustration properties according to the degeneracy of the local ground spaces , establish rigorous conditions for the presence of quantum frustration , and derive an exact inequality on pairwise frustration based on entanglement monogamy . in section  [ sec : transition ] we use these results to investigate the transition from generic frustration to genuine quantum frustration in models with competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - to - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions , and identify different phases associated , respectively , to generic frustration and to genuine quantum frustration . in section  [ sec : observability ] we discuss the observable characterization of such frustration transitions in terms of the static structure factor and the direct observation of the universal measure of total frustration in terms of the interferometric visibility . summary and outlook are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "here we review the main aspects of a universal measure of total frustration expressed in terms of the incompatibility between local and global orders , and briefly discuss how this universal measure ( global - to - local incompatibility , or global - to - local infidelity ) connects to quantum entanglement .",
    "the class of many - body hamiltonians @xmath1 under investigation comprises all those that can be written as sums of different local terms : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for the global ( total ) system and @xmath4 are the local subsystems associated to the local interactions @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider one such local subsystem @xmath6 .",
    "denoting the remainder of the total system by @xmath7 , frustration of @xmath6 occurs when the local projection of the global ground state of @xmath1 , obtained by partial trace over @xmath8 , i.e. the reduced state of subsystem @xmath6 , fails to belong to the local ground state space of @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , such frustration is directly quantified in terms of the overlap between the projector @xmath9 onto the local ground state space of the local hamiltonian @xmath5 and the reduced local density matrix @xmath10 from the global ground state @xmath11 of the total hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the ensuing universal measure of total frustration @xmath12 is thus defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath13 the measure is uniquely defined as long as @xmath3 features a non degenerate global ground state space , while all local subsystems @xmath6 may feature local ground spaces of arbitrary degeneracy .",
    "if the global ground state is degenerate , then the measure can in general depend on which global ground state is actually considered .",
    "uniqueness is guaranteed by considering the _ a priori _ equiprobable statistical average , i.e. the convex combination of all possible degenerate global ground states with equal weights or , in other words , the maximally mixed global ground state ( mmggs )  @xcite .",
    "ground - state degeneracy in the presence of ordered phases with nonvanishing local order parameters is tied to spontaneous breaking of some symmetries of the total hamiltonian , while , by definition , the mmggs preserves all symmetries of the model . choosing a particular global ground state among the degenerate ones or the mmggs depends on whether one is interested in features of the frustration that are , respectively , either state- or model - dependent . in the following",
    "we will study frustration in different quantum spin systems featuring both non - degenerate and degenerate global ground states .",
    "majorization theory and the cauchy interlacing theorem provide an immediate link between frustration and entanglement .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show that @xmath12 is bounded from below by a quantity @xmath14 that depends uniquely on the reduced local density matrix @xmath15  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 the index @xmath18 denotes the rank of the local ground space projector @xmath9 and @xmath19 are the the first @xmath18 largest eigenvalues of the reduced local density matrix @xmath15 in descending order .    in the case of a non - degenerate global ground state @xmath11 the quantity @xmath14 coincides with the hilbert - schmidt distance between @xmath11 and the set of pure states with schmidt rank less or equal to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "this quantity is a proper entanglement monotone  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath20 , i.e. in the case of a non - degenerate ground space of the local interaction term @xmath5 , it coincides with the bipartite geometric entanglement introduced in ref .",
    "this is the ground - state entanglement between the local block @xmath6 and the remainder @xmath8 of the total many body system @xmath3 as measured by the hilbert - schmidt distance @xmath21 of the pure ground state @xmath22 from the set of the pure bi - separable states @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 therefore @xmath26 realizes a quantum lower bound to total frustration in terms of the bipartite geometric entanglement .",
    "the fact that the above measure of frustration is bounded from below by quantum entanglement when the many - body system features a pure , non - degenerate global ground state is a direct consequence of the fact that for pure states all quantum correlations reduce to entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "mixed states allow for quantum correlations more general than entanglement , such as the quantum discord , that can be present even in separable states .",
    "one needs to keep track of this important difference when considering the general case of degenerate global ground states . indeed , in order to introduce a measure of frustration that should not depend on the choice of one particular state among the possible degenerate ones , we need to introduce a reference global ground state that properly averages over all possible degenerate ground states and preserves all symmetries of the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "this can be achieved either by taking a coherent quantum superposition of all the degenerate ground states with equal amplitudes , or by introducing the maximally mixed global ground state ( mmggs ) , i.e. the convex combination of all the possible pure ground states with equal probability weights .",
    "in such a mixed state , correlations are not completely characterized by quantum entanglement alone , and the quantity @xmath14 turns into the sum of the ground - state block entanglement between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , as measured by the convex roof of the pure - state bipartite geometric entanglement , plus the classical correlations that are established between the local subsystem @xmath6 and an ancillary system when the latter performs a generalized quantum measurement on @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "relation  ( [ inequality ] ) allows for a more refined classification of frustration in the quantum domain than merely distinguishing between frustrated and non - frustrated systems , as in the classical domain .",
    "namely , we can now introduce the following classification of quantum systems according to frustration :    * frustration - free systems ( ff ) : + @xmath27 * inequality saturating systems ( ines ) : + @xmath28 * inequality non - saturating systems ( non - ines ) : + @xmath29    accordingly , if generic frustration is absent , the system is always in an ines ground state and thus either frustration - free if the ground state is classically correlated or genuinely quantum frustrated if it is quantum correlated .",
    "when the inequality is not saturated ( non - ines ) the system s total frustration in general comprises both generic and genuine quantum contributions .",
    "indeed , as we will show in the following , the interplay between generic frustration and genuine quantum frustration and the transition from non - ines to ines configurations correspond to transitions from phases with classical - like magnetic order to phases with genuine quantum order .",
    "let us consider translationally - invariant ( periodic boundary conditions ) many - body system consisting of @xmath30 elementary constituents , featuring generic two - body ( pairwise ) interaction terms with the only constraint that they preserve the parity symmetry along the three independent spin directions , so that the total many - body hamiltonian reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the pauli spin operators ( @xmath33 ) for the @xmath34-th spin and @xmath35 is the interaction coupling strength between spins @xmath36 along the @xmath37 direction . for such hamiltonians the elementary local interaction subsystems @xmath6",
    "are naturally identified as the ones made up by pairs of directly interacting spins with local hamiltonian @xmath38 whose energy eigenstates are the four maximally entangled bell states ( singlet and triplet states ) .    for such hamiltonians that include , among others , the ising , @xmath39 , and heisenberg models , it is possible to introduce a quantum generalization of the classical toulouse criteria for frustration - free systems  @xcite .",
    "the first step of this construction consists in defining a prototype model .",
    "a quantum spin hamiltonian of the type eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is a _ prototype _ model if there exists _ at least _",
    "one local ground state common to all local interaction terms @xmath38 and all pairwise couplings are ferromagnetic ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "having defined the prototype model , a quantum version of the toulouse criteria can be formulated as follows : + _ i )  the mmggs of a prototype models is ines for all pairwise interaction terms @xmath38 . _ + _ ii )  for all models obtained from a prototype model by local unitary operations and partial transpositions acting on any arbitrary subsystem , the mmggs is still ines on all pairwise interaction terms @xmath38 . _",
    "the quantum toulouse criteria allow to make predictions on the frustration of a model without requiring the complete and exact diagonalization of the system .",
    "in fact , they allow to state powerful exact relations between the degeneracy of the local ground spaces , entanglement , and the presence of quantum frustration in systems described by hamiltonians of the form eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "indeed , a key feature of a prototype model is that all interacting pairs admit at least one local ground state in common .",
    "then , the following holds :    if a many body system with pairwise local interactions satisfies the quantum toulouse criteria and the degeneracy of the ground space common to all local interacting pairs has dimension @xmath41 , then the system is necessarily frustration - free , i.e. : @xmath42    if a model satisfies the quantum toulouse criteria and the common ground space has dimension @xmath43 , then all interacting pairs admit as common ground state two out of the four maximally entangled bell states .",
    "obviously any linear coherent superposition of these two bell states is again a legitimate ground state of each local interacting pair .",
    "all possible superpositions include separable ones of the form @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the fully factorized state @xmath45 is a legitimate ground state of the total many - body hamiltonian , in close analogy to the situation that occurs at the factorization points of many - body hamiltonians in transverse fields  @xcite . by immediate inspection",
    ", the ground state @xmath46 has vanishing frustration , single - site entanglement , and pair block entanglement for all interacting pairs .",
    "moreover , since the total energy associated to @xmath46 is the sum of the minimum energies of all local pair interaction terms , any possible other total ground state must feature the same property and hence its projection onto any pair of interacting spins must belong to the pair local ground space , implying that its frustration vanishes on all pairs .",
    "exactly the same argument applies also to the cases of local ground space degeneracy @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we are thus left with the only non - trivial case of a local ground space degeneracy @xmath20 , corresponding to local pairs of interacting spins admitting one of the four bell states as a local ground state .",
    "in such a case , the quantum lower bound to frustration always coincides with the ground - state geometric entanglement between the local block ( pair ) @xmath49 and the rest of the system . dropping from now on the index @xmath20 , it reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the largest eigenvalue of the reduced local density matrix @xmath15 . from now on , without loss of generality , we will consider the case of anti - ferromagnetically interacting pairs of spins admitting as unique , non - degenerate ground state the antisymmetric singlet state : @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding projector onto the local ground space then reads @xmath53 exploiting the symmetry under parity along the three spin directions , the two - body reduced local density matrix takes the general form @xmath54 here @xmath55 denote the spin - spin correlation functions : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the spin operators and @xmath58 indicates the expectation value over the ground state of the system .",
    "consequently , the frustration of each interacting local spin pair reads @xmath59 and the quantum lower bound @xmath60 on the total frustration @xmath61 of each local interacting pair reads @xmath62 since the eigenvectors of @xmath63 are the four bell states we can establish a direct connection between the total frustration @xmath61 , the quantum lower bound @xmath60 , i.e. the ground - state entanglement between the local interacting pair @xmath64 and the remainder of the systems , and the entanglement of formation between the spins @xmath34 and @xmath65 in the pair , as measured by the concurrence @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "we have that the following inequality holds : @xmath67 where @xmath66 is the concurrence of the spin pair @xmath68 and we have exploited the explicit analytic form that it takes on the set of the four bell states .",
    "equality holds only when the frustration is ines , i.e. when @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , saturation of the inequality implies a direct correspondence between quantum frustration , a global feature of the pair as measured by its block geometric entanglement with respect to the remainder of the entire many - body system , and the local quantum entanglement within the pair .",
    "the more frustrated the subsystem @xmath68 is with respect to the remainder of the many - body system , the weaker is the internal entanglement between spins @xmath34 and @xmath65 forming the pair .",
    "moreover , since the quantum lower bound @xmath60 is the entanglement between the local pair and the remainder of the many - body system if and only if the global ground state is pure , from ineq .",
    "( [ epsconcurrence ] ) it follows for all pure global ground states that the stronger the entanglement between spins in the local pair , the weaker is the entanglement of the pair with the remainder of the many - body system .",
    "these relations allow for a restatement of frustration in terms of entanglement shareability . indeed , exploiting the coffman - kundu - wootters - osborne - verstraete monogamy inequality  @xcite that sets precise constraints on the entanglement that can be shared among many spins",
    ", we find the following _ `` frustration monogamy '' _ :",
    "@xmath70 in the above , @xmath71 denotes the subset of spins that interact with spin @xmath34 , while @xmath72 denotes the total spin system without spin @xmath34 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath73 is the tangle  @xcite . when the global ground state is non degenerate , it coincides with the squared concurrence measuring the single - site entanglement of spin @xmath34 with all other spins in the system . for spin systems described by hamiltonians of the form eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) the tangle takes the expression @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the local magnetization along the @xmath37 direction .",

    "these two limiting regimes are characterized by two simple antiferromagnetic orders that essentially coincide with those of the classical ising case .",
    "[ lattices ] summarizes this behavior pictorially in terms of the lattice structure . in the limit @xmath145 the lattice reduces to a single chain with lattice spacing @xmath101 and nn anti - ferromagnetic interactions , allowing for a simple anti - ferromagnetic order . in the limit @xmath151 the lattice effectively splits into two chains , each with lattice spacing @xmath98 and nn anti - ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "two simple anti - ferromagnetic orders are then established on each chain .",
    "however , in the quantum models a further intermediate regime is established in the central interval starting at the majumdar - ghosh point and extending to the right , i.e. with increasing values of @xmath103 . in this interval",
    ", we observe a smooth crossover in terms of a succession of small but sizable step - jumps in the behavior of the nn and nnn pair frustrations .",
    "this intermediate , central regime corresponds to the onset of a quantum order that is well distinguished from the two classical ( ising - like ) anti - ferromagnetic regimes discussed above .",
    "the lower and upper values of this interval are , respectively , the majumdar - ghosh point and the boundary point @xmath130 corresponding the last step - jump in the increasing behavior of @xmath117 and decreasing behavior of @xmath135 .",
    "the fact that a sharp change in the behavior in the frustration properties appears exactly at the majumdar - ghosh point may seem at first surprising , since the transition to the dimerized phase in the @xmath84 model , regardless of the anisotropy , occurs at a critical value @xmath152 much lower than @xmath99 .",
    "for example , in the case of the fully isotropic heisenberg model , @xmath153 , the critical value @xmath154 , as determined by extensive numerical investigations based on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and other numerical algorithms  @xcite . however , the frustration does not feature any sharp change when crossing @xmath155 .",
    "the smooth behavior of the frustration at @xmath155 and the appearance of step - jumps in the frustration when the system is in the intermediate quantum regime deserve further comments .",
    "let us first consider the physical origin of the step - jumps .",
    "one might conjecture that they are due to finite - size effects and that they should disappear when considering much larger chains .",
    "in fact , this is not the case , as can be already understood by considering chains of relatively small size .",
    "indeed , by looking at the structure of the ground state in correspondence to the occurrence of the step - jumps , we have verified by analyzing the numerical data obtained from exact diagonalization that at these points exact crossovers are realized between ground states of different parity .",
    "these crossovers are then responsible for the sudden increasing of the nn frustration and the corresponding sudden decreasing of the nnn frustration that are observed in the interval @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "this structure of ground - state crossovers appears similar to the one occurring in @xmath39 chains in transverse field @xmath157 , for values of @xmath157 below the factorizing field @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can draw a very close parallel between the two - site factorization of the ground state of the @xmath84 model at the majumdar - ghosh exact dimerization point @xmath99 , and the single - site factorization of the ground state of the @xmath39 model at the exact factorizing field @xmath158 .",
    "firstly , in both cases , the sharp change in the behavior of various physical quantities , including frustration and ground - state entanglement , that occurs exactly at the respective factorization points ( single - site factorization in the @xmath39 model at @xmath158 , two - site factorization in the @xmath84 model at @xmath99 ) , is always present , independently of the size of the system  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the finite - size @xmath39 chain , the crossovers occur between ground states of different parity and appear for @xmath159 .",
    "such crossovers are always present , but their number and position depend on the size of the system  @xcite .",
    "the crossovers terminate exactly at @xmath160 and @xmath161 . at each crossover , several physical quantities , including frustration and ground - state entanglement , feature step - jumps completely analogous to the ones that are featured in the central quantum regime of the finite - size @xmath84 model , i.e. in the region @xmath162 .",
    "the analogy is complete by observing that the crossovers terminate exactly at @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and that both exact ground state factorization and exact ground state dimerization are not associated to any quantum phase transition . indeed ,",
    "as already mentioned , both the majumdar - ghosh point in the @xmath84 model and the factorization point in the @xmath39 model occur independently of the size of the system .",
    "moreover , both points are always associated to a double degeneracy of the global ground state .    in the @xmath39 model , where all quantities can be evaluated analytically and",
    "controlled precisely both at finite - size and in the thermodynamic limit , it is possible to verify exactly that the number of the step - jumps increases while the height of the jumps decreases as the size of the chain increases ; in the thermodynamic limit the height of the jumps vanishes exactly and a fully analytic behavior is restored . unfortunately , the non - solvability of the @xmath84 model prevents us , at least at the moment , to establish whether the central quantum region extends indefinitely , i.e. the boundary point @xmath130 increases as the size of the chain diverges , and whether analyticity is restored in the thermodynamic limit .    concerning the smooth behavior of the frustration observed at @xmath155 in small chains , we remark that the dramatic change to _ exact _ ground state dimerization occurs at and only at @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , our investigation relies on exact diagonalization , which is feasible only for chains of rather limited size . to address larger sizes , one would need to resort to dmrg and related algorithms such as matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "however , the existing codes are not suitable , as they stand , for the evaluation of the frustration measure .",
    "the first stumbling block is that the dmrg algorithm needs profound modifications and improvements in order to compute reduced density matrices and projectors onto the local ground spaces , their eigenvectors , and their spectra , in the presence of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the second stumbling block is that , while dmrg allows to evaluate without much effort the correlation functions between neighboring sites , it works much less efficiently when one needs to compute correlation functions between non - neighboring spins in the chain .",
    "unfortunately , exactly such correlation functions are those needed in order to evaluate , for instance , the static structure factor .",
    "these difficulties have motivated us , whenever direct exact analytical evaluation proved to be impossible , to resort to exact diagonalization algorithms based on augmented lanczos methods .    in case of sufficiently large chains , the frustration measure is indeed expected to detect the transition to approximate dimerization by showing an inflection at @xmath155 , in the same way as it does in exactly solvable models that we are currently verifying , such as the 1-d @xmath39 model , or the 1-d kitaev and cluster - ising models of symmetry - protected topological order  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath165 model this behavior can become evident only once more powerful numerical techniques are developed in order to evaluate the frustration in chains of sizes much larger than the ones that are allowed by resorting to exact diagonalization .    .",
    "for @xmath145 nnn interactions are strongly suppressed and the lattice reduces to a nn interacting chain with lattice spacing @xmath101 . for @xmath151",
    "the lattice splits into two independent nn interacting chains , each with lattice spacing @xmath98.,width=245 ]",
    "the nature of the intermediate , central _ quantum regime _ in comparison to the two standard anti - ferromagnetic orders is best captured by studying the behavior of the static structure factor , as defined below and reported in fig .",
    "[ ssf_figure ] .",
    "indeed , as changes in the patterns of quantum frustration imply a transition between different lattice geometries , we can connect them to the quantum momentum distribution observed in experiments , which is quantified by the static structure factor @xmath166 : @xmath167 where @xmath101 is the lattice spacing , @xmath168 is the wave vector , and @xmath169 is the spin operator vector of the @xmath34th whose components are the three pauli spin-1/2 matrices . in most experimental situations",
    "direct access to the correlation functions for each pair can be extremely challenging .",
    "in such cases an `` averaged '' and `` collective '' information such as the static structure factor , that can be obtained from the analysis of the visibility which quantifies the contrast of the time - of - flight images  @xcite , may provide useful coarse - grained information on the changes in the quantum orders due to changes in the frustration patterns .    in fig .",

    "although the analysis of the static structure factor provides useful information about the behavior of the frustration measure , in general it can not yield complete information about the relation between the frustration and its quantum lower bound @xmath60 . indeed , while the existence of a direct relationship between the static structure factor and the frustration is due to a qualitatively similar dependence of both quantities on sums of correlation functions , a fact that can be immediately appreciated seen comparing eq .",

    "such schemes have been recently investigated and specialized to quantum simulators realized with atomic ensembles in optical lattices , either in terms of quantum switches  @xcite or multiparticle atomic interferometers  @xcite , and are close to experimental realizability  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a measure of frustration based on the global - to - local incompatibility overlap ( global - to - local infidelity ) quantifies efficiently both generic ( geometric , common to and equal for classical and quantum systems alike ) and genuinely quantum sources of frustration .    for a large class of hamiltonians",
    "we have proven that the presence of genuine quantum frustration is possible only if the ground states of the local interaction terms are non degenerate , that is , the rank of the projection operator onto the ground space of the local interacting subsystems is @xmath20 .    in such cases",
    "the total frustration can be related , via different upper and lower bounds , with two types of entanglement : the internal ( local ) entanglement between the constituents of the local interaction terms , and the block ( global ) entanglement between the local interaction terms and the remainder of the total many - body system .",
    "moreover , we have established a `` monogamy of frustration '' relation quantifying the trade - off on frustration due to the interplay between local and global entanglement .",
    "we have then applied these general results to spin hamiltonians with competing anti - ferromagnetic interactions on different length scales , thus featuring simultaneously generic and genuine quantum contributions to the total frustration .",
    "we have then shown that the quantum phase transition to exact ground - state dimerization and valence bond solids corresponds to an exact transition to genuine quantum frustration .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the total frustration as a function of the physical parameters of a generic class of many - body hamiltonians .",
    "we have identified three different regimes , two generic ones in which frustration due to geometry dominates and only one of the competing interaction terms is strongly frustrated while the remaining one is essentially frustration - free , giving rise to phases with a well defined , classical - like , anti - ferromagnetic order , and an intermediate one in which genuine quantum frustration is non - negligible , the total frustrations of the competing interaction terms are comparable , and a quantum valence bond solid phase is established with no definite magnetic order .",
    "we have further shown how these different many - body regimes can be clearly identified in an experiment by investigating the behavior of the static structure factor , a collective observable amenable to direct observation in time - of - flight experiments for quantum spin chains realized by atom - optical quantum simulators .",
    "finally , we have also briefly discussed the possibility of the direct observation of frustration , as quantified by our global - to - local incompatibility , by measuring the visibility in experiments with atomic interferometers .",
    "the investigation was carried out for one - dimensional systems with competing nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next - to - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions , but the methodological framework is general and in principle can be applied also to the study of systems with long - range interactions and/or to higher dimensions and different lattice geometries .    the concepts introduced in the present work might be particularly relevant to the investigation of systems that feature maximally quantum ( nonlocal ) and global orders , such as quantum spin liquids  @xcite featuring topological order  @xcite .",
    "topologically ordered phases do not break any symmetry of the many - body hamiltonian , do not admit local order parameters , and feature a robust ground - state topological degeneracy and a complex pattern of long - range ground - state entanglement .",

    "the global - to - local incompatibility overlap is defined in any spatial dimension ( at variance with topological entropy , which is not defined for one - dimensional systems ) , it is in principle computable in a clearly and unambiguously defined way ( topological entropy has to be computed by complex and extremely delicate subtraction schemes ) , and is amenable to direct observation by strategies relying on time - of - flight or interferometric experiments ( von neumann topological entropy is not directly accessible to experimental observation , and one should rely instead on the measurement of the two - rnyi topological entropy ) . on this basis , we are currently investigating the scaling behavior of frustration as a characterization of topological order  @xcite .    in general terms",
