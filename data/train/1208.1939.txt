    "the nonnegative reals @xmath2 under the usual multiplication give rise to two semirings with addition defined in two ways : first with the usual addition , and second where the role of addition is played by maximum .",
    "thus we consider the properties of nonnegative matrices with entries in two semirings , the semiring of nonnegative numbers with usual addition and multiplication called `` * nonnegative algebra * '' , and the semiring called `` * max(-times ) algebra * '' .",
    "our chief object of study is the * core * of a nonnegative matrix @xmath1 .",
    "this concept was introduced by pullman in  @xcite , and is defined as the intersection of the cones generated by the columns of matrix powers @xmath0 .",
    "pullman provided a geometric approach to the perron - frobenius theory of nonnegative matrices based on the properties of the core .",
    "he investigated the action of a matrix on its core showing that it is bijective and that the extremal rays of the core can be partitioned into periodic orbits .",
    "in other words , extremal rays of the core of @xmath1 are nonnegative eigenvectors of the powers of @xmath1 ( associated with positive eigenvalues ) .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper is to extend pullman s core to max algebra , thereby investigating the periodic sequence of eigencones of max - algebraic matrix powers .",
    "however , following the line of  @xcite , we develop the theory in max algebra and nonnegative algebra simultaneously , in order to emphasize common features as well as differences , to provide general ( simultaneous ) proofs where this is possible .",
    "we do not aim to obtain new results , relative to  @xcite , on the usual core of a nonnegative matrix .",
    "however , our unifying approach leads in some cases ( e.g. , theorem  [ t : tam - schneider ] ( iii ) ) to new and more elementary proofs than those given previously .",
    "our motivation is closely related to the litvinov - maslov correspondence principle  @xcite , viewing the idempotent mathematics ( in particular , max algebra ) as a `` shadow '' of the `` traditional '' mathematics over real and complex fields .    to the authors knowledge ,",
    "the core of a nonnegative matrix has not received much attention in linear algebra . however",
    ", a more detailed study has been carried out by tam and schneider  @xcite , who extended the concept of core to linear mappings preserving a proper cone .",
    "the case when the core is a polyhedral ( i.e. , finitely generated ) cone was examined in detail in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) , and the results were applied to study the case of nonnegative matrix in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .",
    "this work has found further applications in the theory of dynamic systems acting on the path space of a stationary bratteli diagram . in particular , bezuglyi  et  al .",
    "@xcite describe and exploit a natural correspondence between ergodic measures and extremals of the core of the incidence matrix of such a diagram .",
    "on the other hand , there is much more literature on the related but distinct question of the limiting sets of homogeneous and non - homogeneous markov chains in nonnegative algebra ; see the books by hartfiel  @xcite and seneta  @xcite and , e.g. , the works of chi  @xcite and sierksma  @xcite . in max algebra , see the results on the ultimate column span of matrix powers for irreducible matrices ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.3.11 ) , @xcite ) , and by merlet  @xcite on the invariant max cone of non - homogeneous matrix products .",
    "the theory of the core relies on the behaviour of matrix powers . in the nonnegative algebra ,",
    "recall the works of friedland - schneider  @xcite and rothblum - whittle  @xcite ( on the role of distinguished classes which we call `` spectral classes '' , algebraic and geometric growth rates , and various applications ) .",
    "the theory of max - algebraic matrix powers is similar .",
    "however , the max - algebraic powers have a well - defined periodic ultimate behaviour starting after sufficiently large time .",
    "this ultimate behaviour has been known since the work of cuninghame - green  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 27 - 9 ) , cohen  et  al .",
    "@xcite ( irreducible case ) , and is described in greater generality and detail , e.g. , by akian , gaubert and walsh  @xcite , gavalec  @xcite , de schutter  @xcite , and the authors   of the present paper . in particular , the cyclicity theorem of cohen  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) implies that extremals of the core split into periodic orbits for any irreducible matrix ( see subsection 4.2 below ) .",
    "some results on the eigenvectors of max - algebraic matrix powers have been obtained by butkovi and cuninghame - green  @xcite .",
    "the present paper also aims to extend and complete the research initiated in that work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : prel ]",
    "we introduce the basics of irreducible and reducible perron - frobenius theory in max algebra and in nonnegative linear algebra . in section  [",
    "s : key ] we formulate the two key results of this paper .",
    "the first key result is main theorem  [ t : core ] stating that the matrix core equals to the minkowski sum of the eigencones of matrix powers ( that is , for each positive integer @xmath3 , we take the sum of the eigencones associated with @xmath0 , and then we sum over all @xmath3 ) .",
    "the second key result is main theorem  [ t : periodicity ] stating that the sequence of eigencones of matrix powers is periodic and defining the period .",
    "this section also contains a table of notations used throughout the paper .",
    "section  [ s : core ] is devoted to the proof of main theorem  [ t : core ] , taking in `` credit '' the result of main theorem  [ t : periodicity ] ( whose proof is deferred to the end of the paper ) . in section  [ s : sameaccess ]",
    "we explain the relation between spectral classes of different matrix powers , and how the eigencones associated with general eigenvalues can be reduced to the case of the greatest eigenvalue , see in particular theorems  [ t : samespectrum ] and  [ t : reduction ] . in section  [",
    "s : extremals ] we describe extremals of the core in both algebras extending  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.7 ) , see theorem  [ t : tam - schneider ] . prior to this result",
    "we formulate the frobenius - victory theorems  [ t : fvnonneg ] and  [ t : fvmaxalg ] giving a parallel description of extremals of eigencones in both algebras . in section  [ s :",
    "eigencones ] , our first goal is to show that the sequence of eigencones of matrix powers in max algebra is periodic , comparing this result with the case of nonnegative matrix algebra , see theorem  [ t : girls ] .",
    "then we study the inclusion relation on eigencones and deduce main theorem  [ t : periodicity ] .",
    "the key results are illustrated by a pair of examples in section  [ s : examples ] .",
    "in this paper we are concerned only with nonnegative eigenvalues and nonnegative eigenvectors of a nonnegative matrix . in order to bring our terminology into line with the corresponding theory for max algebra we use the terms eigenvalue and eigenvector in a restrictive fashion appropriate to our semiring point of view .",
