    "for an even positive integer @xmath1 , zagier @xcite defines the function @xmath13 by @xmath14 and investigates its striking properties .",

    "* section 9 ) , zagier explains how one can gain the extra freedom and to allow @xmath4 to be odd : he suggests to consider a symmetrization @xmath16 where the summation is restricted to quadratic forms in one equivalence class @xmath17 which is an orbit in @xmath10 under the action of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 however , restricting to one class @xmath20 does not allow for a generalization to odd @xmath4 of one of important properties of @xmath0 which is discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 14 ) .",
    "namely , one can define a constant @xmath21 such that for every @xmath22 , for even @xmath23 , the generating function @xmath24 , where the sum is taken over all discriminants @xmath25 , is the @xmath26-expansion of a modular form of weight @xmath3 in kohnen s @xmath27-space .",
    "the functions @xmath0 are @xmath28-periodic , and their average values are calculated by zagier in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) .",
    "these are , up to a common multiple , @xmath26-expansion coefficients of h. cohen s eisenstein series . in order to state the result of this calculation ,",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the weight @xmath3 eisenstein series on @xmath30 introduced by h. cohen in @xcite : @xmath31 the summation runs over discriminants @xmath2 such that @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denote cohen s numbers .",
    "these are essentially the values at negative integers of dirichlet @xmath34-function of the quadratic character associated with the field extension @xmath35 .",

    "the result of zagier s calculation in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) can now be stated as the identity @xmath37 which holds for even @xmath1 .    in this paper",

    "namely , for even @xmath42 , we have @xmath45    by the same argument as in @xcite , our functions @xmath5 are @xmath28-periodic and continuous for @xmath42 , thus their average values make sense .",

    ", we have that @xmath55    the proof of theorem 1 is presented in section 2 .",
    "equality of constant terms of @xmath26-series in theorem 1 follows directly from the definition of cohen s numbers @xmath56 in @xcite .",
    "thus theorem 1 is equivalent to the term - by - term identity @xmath57 and that is what we prove in section 2 .",
    "this proof depends on two technical propositions ( proposition [ mult ] and [ fact ] in section 2 ) which claim a decomposition of a certain dirichlet series into an euler product , and calculate its euler factors .",
    "the proofs of these propositions are presented in section 3 of the paper .",
    "the value of genus character @xmath58 depends only on the class @xmath59 such that @xmath60 , not on the individual form @xmath61 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath62 where the sum is taken over all classes @xmath63 of quadratic forms of discriminant @xmath53 , and @xmath64 are introduced and briefly discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9 ) .",
    "in particular , since @xmath65 are periodic functions with period @xmath28 , so are our @xmath5 , and the integrals in the left of ( [ i d ] ) may be interpreted as average values of these functions . in section 4 , we address the case when @xmath48 .",
