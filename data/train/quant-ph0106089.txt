    "before the birth of quantum mechanics , optics and mechanics have long developed on parallel tracks , as light and massive entities were considered as waves and particles , respectively . at the beginning of the 20th century , with the introduction of quantum mechanics , waves and particles started to play an interchangeable role , with the concepts of photons and of de broglie wavelength .",
    "this gave rise to the birth of quantum optics and atom optics  @xcite .",
    "however , while an optical single - mode system has already been available since long ago , the same can not be said for matter waves .",
    "in fact , in the field of atom optics , only recently breakthroughs in the evaporative cooling of dilute alkali gases have allowed the generation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "the bec is a macroscopic occupation of the ground state of the gas and is one important paradigm of quantum statistical mechanics .    in recent theoretical and experimental investigations of bec ,",
    "one of the most important and urgent issues is the determination of the actual quantum state of the condensate .",
    "in fact , as in optics , the presence of many particles in a single mode makes it possible to inquire about the multiparticle quantum state of the mode . at first thought , a number state might seem a natural description of a condensate mode , but the actual state may well depend on the details of preparation . for example",
    "the demonstration of first - order interference @xcite and observations of normalized , spatial correlation functions @xcite near unity suggest coherent states , while the presence of collisions between atoms may lead to the formation of squeezed states @xcite .",
    "also the internal states of the condensate atoms allow precise manipulation of the bec state by interaction with light @xcite .",
    "few experimental methods of obtaining partial information about the state have been suggested @xcite . on the other hand , motivated by the success of quantum tomographic techniques in optics @xcite , more direct methods for measuring the quantum state of a bec",
    "were recently proposed @xcite .    in optical tomography ,",
    "the key point is the use of a reference field , namely the local oscillator @xcite .",
    "the latter , prepared in a coherent state , allows one to probe the desired state through the measurement of a set of probabilities @xcite .",
    "however , a difficulty arises if we try to adapt the same technique to a bec .",
    "in fact , while in optics it is easy to obtain a coherent reference field ( e.g. from a laser ) , the same is not actually available for atoms . nevertheless , recent progresses in this direction seem promising @xcite .",
    "hence , in the present paper , we provide a detailed study of the possibility to reconstruct the quantum state of a bec which includes both the scenarios : when a reference field is available and when it is not .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the tomographic principle and consider a suitable operator transform on the atomic system . in section iii",
    ", we consider the case of state reconstruction in the absence of a reference field , while in section iv the opposite case is analyzed . finally , in section v we comment the numerical results , and in section vi we conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "recently , we established  @xcite a quite general principle of constructing measurable probabilities , which determine completely the quantum state in the tomographic approach . for a more refined treatment",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider a quantum state described by the density operator @xmath0 , which is a nonnegative hermitian operator , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 we label the vector basis @xmath3 in the space of pure quantum states by the index @xmath4 which may represent any degrees of freedom of the system under consideration .",
    "formula  ( [ rhovv ] ) can be rewritten by using the hermitian projection operator @xmath5 in the following form @xmath6    on the other hand , in the space of states , there will be a family of unitary transformation operators @xmath7 depending on some parameters @xmath8 , that can be sometimes identified with a group - representation operators .",
    "it was shown @xcite that known tomography schemes can be considered from the viewpoint of group theory by using appropriate groups . more recently",
    "this concept has been developed obtaining an elegant group theoretical approach to quantum state measurement @xcite . here",
    ", we formulate the tomographic approach in the following way .",
    "let us introduce a `` transformed density operator '' @xmath9 its diagonal elements are still nonnegative probabilities @xmath10 these probabilities are functions of stochastic variable(s ) @xmath4 and parameter(s ) @xmath11 . as a consequence of the unit trace of the density operator , they also fulfill the normalization condition @xmath12 of course , in the case of discrete indices , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ normz ] ) should be replaced by a sum over discrete variables .    the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ wz ] ) can be interpreted as the probability density for the measurement of the observable @xmath13 ( the operator whose eigenstates are given by @xmath14 ) in an ensemble of transformed reference frames labeled by the index @xmath11 , if the state @xmath0 is given . along with this interpretation",
    ", one can also consider the transformed projector @xmath15 in terms of which the expression  ( [ wz ] ) for the probability @xmath16 takes the form @xmath17\\,.\\ ] ] these probability densities are also called  marginal \" distributions as a generalization of the concept introduced by wigner  @xcite .",
    "the tomography schemes are based on the possibility to find the inverse of eq .",
    "( [ wzpi ] ) . if it is possible to solve eq .",
    "( [ wzpi ] ) , considering the probability @xmath18 as a known function and the density matrix as an unknown operator , the quantum state can be reconstructed in terms of measurable positive definite probability distributions .",
    "this is the essence of state reconstruction techniques .    specifically , we consider two atomic sources whose atoms ( described by two bosonic modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) can be mixed through an atomic beam splitter @xcite , and assume that successively a phase shift @xmath21 can also be introduced between them .",
    "we shall specify these modes later . at the output",
    ", a detection of the number of atoms in both modes can be performed .",
    "this amounts to the possibility of measuring the probability distributions related to the transformed state @xmath22 where the transformation operator is given by @xmath23\\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath24 represents the transmission coefficient at the beam splitter .",
    "( [ prob ] ) plays the same role of eq .",
    "( [ rhosig ] ) , and , in the spirit of the tomographic principle , the set of  marginals \" associated to the transformed state will allow us to recover the original state .",
    "in the next two sections , as anticipated in the introduction , we shall distinguish two situations .",
    "we first treat the case where a reference field is not available .",
    "all we can do in this case is to consider two condensates belonging to the two modes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and put the constraint of total particle number conservation , i.e. @xmath25=0 $ ] , in order to infer their ( joint ) state .",
    "the latter is assumed to be a generic two - mode state of the type @xmath26 as a spin state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 states @xmath27 have all the properties of the eigenstates of @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 the effect of the beam splitter , including the phase shift , is a rotation by an angle @xmath35 about an axis @xmath36 of the angular momenta @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 on the other hand , the rotation ( [ jrot ] ) can be specified by means of the wigner - d function @xcite @xmath39 where now @xmath40 , @xmath35 , @xmath21 represent the euler s angles .",
    "then , the probability of @xmath41 counts at the first detector and @xmath42 at the second one is given by @xmath43 the measurement of the atomic number in both modes guarantees a unit efficiency .",
    "in fact , data for which the sum of counts is not @xmath44 can be disregarded . moreover , in eq .",
    "( [ wsex ] ) we have left the argument @xmath40 unspecified in the r.h.s . and omitted it in the l.h.s . since @xmath45 : the marginal distribution only depends on the two angles @xmath35 and @xmath21 .    following",
    "@xcite we will derive the expression for the density matrix of a spin state in terms of measurable probability distributions .",
    "this can be done by using the known integral product of three wigner - d functions over the rotation group and the orthogonality of the wigner-3@xmath46 symbols @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "finally , the density matrix elements can be expressed in terms of the marginal distribution as @xmath48 where the integration is performed over the rotation parameters , i.e. @xmath49 thus , eq .  ( [ rhows ] ) can be used to sample two - mode bec density matrix elements starting from the measurable probabilities @xmath50 and some known functions .",
    "recent progress in the generation of an atomic coherent source @xcite makes us hope about the possibility to have an atomic reference field @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall consider in this section the first mode as the condensate to be investigated , and the second one coming from a coherent atomic source .",
    "let @xmath0 be the state of mode 1 we want to reconstruct and @xmath51 the coherent state characterizing mode 2 .",
    "then , the probability of counting @xmath52 atoms in mode 1 for @xmath53 , will be @xmath54 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to the probability distribution for the measurement of the displaced number operator @xmath57 analogously to the photon number tomography @xcite . in that case",
    ", however , one has to collect number distributions by spanning the whole complex plane @xmath58 ; here , instead , we will simplify the procedure ( see also @xcite ) .    of course",
    ", the number of atoms in the condensate , though not fixed , will be finite , thus , it happens that @xmath59 for @xmath60 , with @xmath61 a suitable estimation of the maximum number of the condensed atoms . by virtue of this assumption",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ pnbdef ] ) as @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "let us now consider , for a given value of @xmath64 , the function @xmath65 as function of @xmath66 and calculate the coefficients of the fourier expansion @xmath67 @xmath68 . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ pnal ] ) and ( [ pns ] ) , we get @xmath69 where @xmath70    if the distribution @xmath65 is measured for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , then eq . ( [ pnsrho ] ) represents for each value of @xmath73 a system of @xmath74 linear equations between the @xmath74 measured quantities and the @xmath75 unknown density matrix elements . therefore , to obtain the latter we only need to invert the system @xcite @xmath76 where the matrices @xmath77 are given by @xmath78 .",
    "it is possible to see that such matrices satisfy the relation @xmath79 for @xmath80 , which means that from the exact probabilities satisfying eq .",
    "( [ pnsrho ] ) the correct density matrix is obtained . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ rhobec ] ) and ( [ pns ] ) we find that @xmath81 which may be regarded as the formula for the direct sampling of the condensate density matrix .",
    "in particular we see that the determination of the state of the condensate only requires the value of @xmath66 ( i.e. the phase between reference and condensate field ) to be varied .",
    "moreover , the presented reconstruction procedure involves laguerre polynomials in place of additional summations , which guarantee a better stability in the numerical manipulation of large set of data , with respect to analogous methods  @xcite .",
    "finally , the non unit efficiency @xmath82 in the detection process can be accounted for by considering a binomial convolution of the ideal probability @xcite @xmath83 and the consequent modification of the matrix @xmath84 .",
    "it is plausible , and it has been already suggested @xcite , that the state of a condensate with repulsive collisions be a squeezed state with reduced number fluctuations .",
    "hence in the following we will consider this situation .",
    "the single 1-mode state can be written as @xmath85 are given by @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the squeezing parameter , @xmath88 is the ( real ) displacement and @xmath89 denotes the hermite polynomials .",
    "a phase space representation of this state can be given by the @xmath90-function  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the complex amplitude of a coherent state .",
    "it yields @xmath93 for the case discussed in sec .",
    "iii , we have to consider  @xcite a two - mode squeezed state written in the angular momentum representation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath94 is a normalization factor and the coefficients @xmath95 are given in eq .",
    "( [ cn ] ) .",
    "since the quantity @xmath96 represents the mean number of atoms in mode 1 , it must be smaller then the total number of atoms @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the atomic coherent state basis for a system of angular momentum @xmath46 is defined by  @xcite @xmath97 then , one can define the @xmath90-quasiprobability distribution analogously to eq .",
    "( [ qdef ] ) @xmath98 for the state considered in eq .",
    "( [ psisq12 ] ) , it becomes @xmath99 this is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . instead , fig .",
    "1(b ) displays the @xmath90-function calculated from the reconstructed density matrix elements .",
    "we may see that the method of sec .",
    "iii is quite accurate , apart from some background noise .",
    "analogously , in fig .",
    "2(a ) we have plotted the ideal wigner function  @xcite of eq .",
    "( [ qone ] ) , while fig .",
    "2(b ) is its reconstructed version . in this case , the statistical error depends on the chosen value of @xmath64 . for @xmath64 close to zero the diagonal density matrix elements can be determined very precisely , whereas the off - diagonal elements strongly fluctuate .",
    "the opposite happens by increasing @xmath64 . to compensate for the fluctuations",
    ", the number of measurement events must be increased .",
    "another source of error stems from the truncation of the reconstructed density matrix at the value @xmath61 .",
    "it is worth comparing the previous results with those obtained in the case of a number state . for this purpose ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3(a ) the ideal wigner function for a number state . in this case , the wigner function becomes negative , displaying the highly non classical character of a fock state .",
    "as above , in fig .",
    "3(b ) we show the wigner function obtained by applying the reconstruction method of sec .",
    "iv to such a state : the two pictures are practically indistinguishable , showing the accuracy of the present method .    finally , as an instructive comparison we show in fig .",
    "4 the same wigner function of fig .",
    "2(a ) calculated when the state reconstruction takes place with a random phase relation between probe and condensate . as can be seen the state becomes randomized and diffused in phase , but its wigner function remains positive .",
    "this figure should be contrasted with fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "the apparent @xmath100 symmetry is not pertaining to the state @xcite , but rather due to the measurement method , which implies a preparation of the ( same ) state at each experimental run .",
    "to conclude , we have studied , through numerical simulations , the possibilities of a tomographic approach to the quantum state of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we have considered two possible scenarios , whether an atomic reference field is available or not .",
    "the corresponding methods turn out to be accurate and robust to detection inefficiency , and allow one to distinguish among various possible quantum states of the condensate .",
    "it is worth noting that the studied techniques allow direct sampling of the density matrix elements avoiding any ambiguities in the reconstruction procedure due to singularities @xcite .",
    "the key point remains the possibility to have a reference field and/or its state preparation .",
    "furthermore , we note the necessity to deal with a relatively small number of atoms in order to implement efficiently the numerical algorithms . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "we retain the possibility of measuring the true density matrix of a condensate accessible and worth considering .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that the presented procedures could also be considered for other fields like high energy heavy ion collisions where pions can condense as well @xcite .",
