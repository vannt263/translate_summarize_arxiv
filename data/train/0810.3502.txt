    "it is notable that the activation regime from the dielectric relaxation does not overlap with the activation regime obtained from the dc resistivity , rather it overlaps partly with the vrh regime. the results clearly indicate that the dc resistivities obeying the activation behavior do not play any significant role on the dielectric relaxation",
