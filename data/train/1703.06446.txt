    "the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) is a retrovirus that causes hiv infection and , over time , acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) @xcite .",
    "the most significant advance in medical management of hiv infection has been the treatment of patients with antiviral drugs , which can suppress hiv replication to undetectable levels . before 1996",
    ", few antiretroviral ( art ) treatment options for hiv infection existed .",
    "the treatment of hiv infection was revolutionized in the mid 1990s with the introduction of drug regimens that combine inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase and protease and two of three essential enzymes of hiv .",
    "combination of antiretroviral drugs , dramatically suppresses viral replication and reduces the hiv viral load to levels below the limits of detection of the most sensitive clinical assays , resulting in a significant reconstitution of the immune system @xcite .",
    "the _ global aids update 2016 _ of the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , reports that the global coverage of art therapy reached approximately 46% at the end of 2015 .",
    "the gains in treatment are largely responsible for a 26% decline in aids - related deaths globally since 2010 , from an estimated 1.5 million in 2010 , to 1.1 million in 2015 . despite this significant achievement",
    ", there has not been a decrease in new infections since 2010 , with more than 2 million new infections reported in 2015 @xcite . the world health organization s ( who ) global health sector strategy on hiv embraces innovation in the hiv response , recommending , for example , that people at substantial risk of hiv infection should be offered pre - exposure prophylaxis ( prep ) as an additional prevention choice , as part of comprehensive prevention .",
    "prep is the use of an antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of hiv infection by uninfected individuals .",
    "several trials among men who have sex with men , people who inject drugs , transgender people , women and serodiscordant couples ( one partner is hiv - positive and the other is hiv - negative ) have shown that when prep is taken , it is an effective and safe mechanism for preventing hiv - infection @xcite .    in @xcite , it is concluded that prep could prevent 2.7 to 3.2 million new cases of hiv in sub - saharan africa over 10 years , if it is targeted to the highest risk groups , and disinhibition could be prevented . in 2008 , the authors of @xcite claimed that prep represents the most powerful available biologic intervention for hiv prevention . in 2016 , who has welcomed a plan by the south african ministry of health to provide immediate antiretroviral treatment to all sex workers with hiv , and to offer daily oral prep to hiv - negative sex workers to prevent them from acquiring the infection @xcite . following who , making prep drugs available for safe , effective prevention outside the clinical trial setting is the current challenge .",
    "substantial gaps remain in understanding the trade - offs between the costs and benefits of choosing alternative hiv prevention strategies , such as the initiation of prep by high risk uninfected individuals @xcite .",
    "mathematical models of hiv that include prep are scarce @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", a mathematical model is used to estimate the effects of early diagnosis , early treatment and prep , on the hiv epidemic in south korea over the next 40 years , as compared with the current situation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors develop a mathematical model to simulate hiv incidence among men residing in los angeles county , ca , aged between 15 to 65 years old , who have sex with men .",
    "they claim that prep and test - and - treat yield the largest reductions in hiv incidence , and are highly cost - effective .",
    "another cost - effectiveness study was done in @xcite and the results showed that prep can be cost - saving if delivered to individuals at increased risk of infection . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new mathematical epidemiological model for hiv / aids transmission including prep , which generalizes the hiv / aids sub - model recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "first , we consider the mathematical model with no prep , calibrate the model to the cumulative cases of infection by hiv and aids from 1987 to 2014 reported in @xcite , and we show that the model predicts well the reality given in @xcite",
    ". in this model , the effective contact with people infected with hiv includes two modification parameters that account for the relative infectiousness of individuals with aids symptoms , in comparison to those infected with hiv with no aids symptoms @xcite , and for partial restoration of the immune function of individuals with hiv infection that use art correctly @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the infectiousness of the hiv - infected individuals under art treatment is a controversial subject .",
    "hiv treatment reduces the viral load in the blood , and also in other body fluids , such as semen and vaginal fluid .",
    "however , not all people living with hiv who take hiv treatment and have an undetectable viral load in the blood also have an undetectable viral load in their other bodily fluids : see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . in our paper , the values considered for the modification parameters are based on two different research studies : the first one is known as _ hptn 052 _ , where it was found that the risk of hiv transmission among heterosexual serodiscordant couples is 96% lower when the hiv - positive partner is on treatment @xcite ; and the other one , where it was proved that hiv - infected individuals under art treatment have a very low probability ( assumed inferior to @xmath1 ) of transmitting hiv @xcite .",
    "we prove the global stability of the endemic equilibrium and we provide numerical simulations , illustrating the calibration of the model to the hiv / aids situation in cape verde .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors evaluate the effect of early hiv treatment and optimization of care , hiv testing , condom distribution , and substance abuse treatment on hiv incidence from 2011 to 2021 , using cape verde as an example .",
    "however , they did not include prep for hiv negative groups at risk as a possible prevention measure . here",
    ", we show that inclusion of prep can reduce significantly the hiv incidence .",
    "we start by proving existence and global stability of the disease free equilibrium of the hiv / aids - prep model .",
    "moreover , we also prove existence of an unique endemic equilibrium and the global stability for some specific relevant cases .",
    "it is important , however , to highlight that prep is not for everyone @xcite .",
    "only people who are hiv - negative and at very high risk for hiv infection should take prep",
    ". moreover , prep is highly expensive and it is still not approved in many countries , e.g. , by the european medicines agency ( emea ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the number of individuals that should take prep is limited at each instant of time . in order to study this health public problem",
    ", we formulate an optimal control problem with a mixed state control constraint .",
    "optimal control theory has been successfully applied to several epidemiological models , e.g. , dengue @xcite , tuberculosis @xcite , ebola @xcite , cholera @xcite , and hiv / aids @xcite .",
    "however , we claim our work to be the first to apply optimal control to an hiv / aids model with prep . more precisely , we consider the hiv / aids - prep model and formulate an optimal control problem with the aim to determine the prep strategy that satisfies the mixed state control constraint and minimizes the number of individuals with pre - aids hiv - infection as well as the costs associated with prep .",
    "we solve the optimal control problem and provide numerical simulations , which show that it is possible to reduce the hiv incidence through prep and having into consideration the limitations related to the implementation of prep ( cost , epidemic context , program coverage and individual - level adherence ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sica : model ] , we consider the sica model for hiv / aids transmission proposed in @xcite and prove the global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium for the case when the associated aids - induced mortality is negligible .",

    "we prove existence of an unique endemic equilibrium point for @xmath4 and its global stability for a negligible aids - induced death rate and strict adherence to prep . through numerical simulations ,",
    "we investigate the impact of prep in the reduction of hiv transmission . in section  [ sec : optimal : control ] , we propose and analyze an optimal control problem with a mixed state control constraint .",
    "numerical simulations show that the extremal solutions combine a reduction of hiv transmission with limited number of individuals under prep at each instant of time .",
    "we end with section  [ sec : conclusion ] of conclusions and future work .",
    "in this section , we analyze a mathematical model for hiv / aids transmission with varying population size in a homogeneously mixing population , first proposed in @xcite , and prove the global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium for the case when the associated aids - induced mortality is negligible .",
    "the model subdivides human population into four mutually - exclusive compartments : susceptible individuals ( @xmath5 ) ; hiv - infected individuals with no clinical symptoms of aids ( the virus is living or developing in the individuals but without producing symptoms or only mild ones ) but able to transmit hiv to other individuals ( @xmath6 ) ; hiv - infected individuals under art treatment ( the so called chronic stage ) with a viral load remaining low ( @xmath7 ) ; and hiv - infected individuals with aids clinical symptoms ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "the modification parameter @xmath15 accounts for the relative infectiousness of individuals with aids symptoms , in comparison to those infected with hiv with no aids symptoms .",
    "individuals with aids symptoms are more infectious than hiv - infected individuals ( pre - aids ) because they have a higher viral load and there is a positive correlation between viral load and infectiousness @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath16 translates the partial restoration of immune function of individuals with hiv infection that use art correctly @xcite .",
