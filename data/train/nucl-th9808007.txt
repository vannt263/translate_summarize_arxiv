    "separation of scales is essential in most problems of physics because it allows the selection of relevant degrees of freedom with a perhaps limited set of dominant interactions .",
    "quantitative understanding then eventually requires a systematic treatment of the less relevant interactions , and methods to accomplish this are several . in nuclear physics this problem was faced early on when it was realized that the deuteron is large compared to the range of the nuclear force , and also in the analysis of slow - neutron scattering from bound protons , where the effects of the nuclear force had to be separated from those of the longer - range , electromagnetic interactions .",
    "this interest led to the treatment of interactions of short range by the equivalent techniques of boundary conditions @xcite , pseudo ",
    "potentials @xcite , and the effective range expansion @xcite . with time",
    ", these techniques came to be replaced by parametrizations of the nuclear force in terms of ( single , sometimes double ) meson exchange , which were perceived as more fundamental .",
    "meanwhile , the method of effective field theories ( efts ) has been developed in particle physics .",
    "the idea is to start from the most general lagrangian involving the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom and some chosen symmetries , short - range dynamics being described by local interactions with an arbitrary number of derivatives . under the assumption that these local terms have natural size",
    ", a power counting argument shows that there exist an expansion in energy that allows the computation of low - energy observables in terms of parameters that summarize the effect of short - range interactions .",
    "this approach is now viewed as the paradigm for understanding the successes of the electroweak theory and of chiral lagrangians .",
    "it is natural to ask what is the connection among these different methods .    in the last few years , the application of eft to the nuclear force problem @xcite has generated a lot of interest ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and further references ) . to a large extent ,",
    "the potential usefulness of the approach lies in the fact that the general chiral lagrangian allows a clear separation between pion effects constrained by the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd and shorter range effects that can not at present be calculated from the qcd dynamics .",
    "although a quantitative description of all nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) channels can be accomplished up to lab energies of about 100 mev @xcite and a qualitative understanding of otherwise mysterious nuclear regularities is possible @xcite , several questions regarding the scope of such approach remain unanswered , such as the role of cut - off _ vs. _ dimensional regularization , the usefulness of a dibaryon field , and the relation to the effective range expansion @xcite .",
    "these issues do not typically arise in particle physics where most applications of eft are to systems where the low - energy domain is perturbative that is , involves a finite number of diagrams in the effective theory .",
    "most of these issues are in fact more general than the @xmath0 problem itself , being independent of the complications generated by spin - dependent interactions , by several partial waves , or by ( long - range ) pion exchange .",
    "they arise from the necessity of summing up an infinite number of diagrams due to infrared quasi - divergences in any eft that contains heavy stable particles .    here",
    "i will therefore restrict myself to a system of two identical , stable spinless particles at energies much smaller than their mass , their internal excitation energy , and the range of their interaction .",
    "generalization to spin and non - identical particles is straightforward , and is directly relevant to strong interactions in any nuclear reaction at sufficiently low energies . in the case of @xmath0 scattering",
    ", relevance is limited to center - of - mass momenta much smaller than the pion mass .",
    "generalization to a potential with both long- and short - range components appropriate for example to charged systems and to @xmath0 strong interactions at center - of - mass momenta comparable to the pion mass will be presented in a separate publication .",
    "i will show in detail how the infinite number of interactions in the eft can be organized systematically by means of power counting , in any regularization scheme .",
    "the power counting itself depends on whether the underlying short - range dynamics is generic , or fine - tuned to display a shallow bound state , or fine - tuned to display a shallow amplitude zero .",
    "these three cases are treated in sect .",
    "3 , after some generalities are presented in sect .",
    "we are going to see that the eft method , when carried out to the end , is equivalent to the ( generalized ) effective range expansion .",
    "the schrdinger equation that results from renormalization of the eft problem will be derived in sect .",
    "4 . i will show that it involves a delta - function pseudo - potential of the type previously considered in nuclear physics , or , equivalently , boundary conditions at the origin .",
    "i will discuss the relation to the traditional potential approach in sect .",
    "necessary restrictions on the regularization scheme will be presented for the traditional approach to hold .",
    "a toy potential is played with in sect . 6 to illustrate some of the consequences of power counting , before conclusion in sect .",

    "the above discussion holds for any scheme where a cut - off mass scale appears explicitly .",

    "@xcite , is special because it defines the integral ( [ regbubbleany ] ) with @xmath342 and @xmath343 .",
    "it suffers from no errors generated by @xmath319 , but it forces the bare parameters to coincide with the renormalized ones and thus be unnaturally large . because no cut - off dependence is visible , if one works to @xmath263 terms it is not immediately apparent that @xmath344 has necessarily to be expanded in @xmath107 .",

    "@xcite that a fitting of the @xmath341 @xmath0 phase shift based on the effective range expansion worked much better than one based on the form @xmath344 , and a suggestion was made that the most useful expansion is that of @xmath345 rather than @xmath346 .",
    "one can understand the failure of the @xmath344 fit by noticing that the induced spurious shape parameter ( [ fakeshape ] ) is here @xmath347 , which is @xmath348 . since there is no regulator to blame the fine - tuning on",

    "_ can not _ substitute the perturbative treatment of corrections by the iteration of the whole potential without reducing the range of applicability of the theory from @xmath14 to the ratio of parameters in the power expansion of the contact interactions , which is @xmath349 .",

    "this is true of minimal subtraction or other subtraction schemes , for example the convenient one invented in ref .",

    "@xcite , the contamination problem of minimal subtraction can be avoided by using the dibaryon field , which in view of our regularization - independent arguments of sect .",
    "3 is not surprising .",
    "the point of using an eft is to describe low - energy physics with minimal assumptions about higher - energy behavior .",
    "the results of this paper hold regardless of the details of the physics that generates the short - range interactions .",
    "they will arise from exchange of ( possibly many ) particles of sufficiently high mass , perhaps in a theory without a small coupling constant .",
    "it might happen that this physics can be equally well described by some potential of range @xmath319 much smaller than the wavelength of the interacting asymptotic particles .",
    "therefore we expect that the eft results should be valid in the particular case of simple quantum - mechanical potentials .    here",

    "these poles cross @xmath357 when @xmath100 takes one of the values @xmath358 .",
    "the zeros of eq .",
    "( [ squaret ] ) , on the other hand , cross @xmath357 when @xmath100 takes one of the values @xmath359 .    for generic values of @xmath360",
    ", there is only one mass scale @xmath361 in the problem : @xmath362 and thus @xmath363 , @xmath364 , and @xmath365 .",
    "as expected , in this generic case the effective range parameters , bound state momenta , and positions of the zeros are all given by the natural mass scale @xmath14 .",

    "i have developed here power countings for efts with natural and unnatural short - range interactions that are manifestly independent of the regularization scheme .",
    "i have shown that the modern eft method applied to the problem of short - range forces is , _ after renormalization _ , completely equivalent to the ancient effective range expansion , and to the methods of pseudo - potentials and boundary conditions . some of the possible pitfalls in the implementation of eft method were also discussed .",
    "why , then , bother with the eft method ?",
    "efts are nowadays thought to be the rationale for the successes of field - theory based particle physics .",
    "we have therefore gained insight into the ancient techniques by seeing how they arise from renormalization in the modern conceptual framework without extra dynamical assumptions .",
    "but it can be argued that this conceptual gain is compensated by a practical loss , in that one can more simply stick to the ancient techniques with the same observable results .",
    "the gain is indeed marginal for the problem at hand , but there are advantages to a field - theoretical framework when other processes in the same energy scale are considered , and we want to treat them all consistently , free of off - shell ambiguities .",
    "power counting applies to these processes as well , although it has to be enlarged to accommodate new operators associated with other particles .",
    "for example , recently the three - body system has been attacked using the power counting of sect . 3.2 . in the case of nucleon - deuteron scattering",
    ", successful model - independent predictions can be achieved very easily @xcite .    yet",
    "the gain is potentially much more significant in more general cases where there are other , lighter degrees of freedom that generate longer - range forces .",
    "one should recall the reason why particle physics found its eft paradigm : symmetries play a dominant role in physics because they restrict the form of s - matrix elements ( and consequently also determine what the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom are ) , and a lagrangian framework is by far the easiest way to incorporate symmetries . the problem considered in this paper had very weak symmetry constraints essentially only on particle number and invariance under small lorentz boosts . in more interesting problems ,",
    "the role of symmetry is bound to be more important , and the eft method more convenient than the ancient techniques .",
    "we only need to return to the @xmath0 system to offer an example : at energies comparable to the pion mass the pion has to be retained as a degree of freedom , and ( approximate ) chiral symmetry is the most important constraint on pion interactions . at sufficiently low energies",
    "the inclusion of the pion is not mandatory , but can be carried out with minor adaptations to the power counting presented above @xcite .",
    "the eft method of chiral lagrangians is the only known , _ systematic _ way to treat this spontaneously broken symmetry , and it has been successful in dealing with low - energy phenomenology from pion - pion interactions to few - nucleon forces @xcite .",
    "i thank r. jaffe and e. lomon for prodding the investigation of the connection between eft and boundary conditions .",
    "extensive discussions with p. bedaque were indispensable for my understanding of @xmath105 counting and uses of the trans ... , er , dibaryon .",
    "helpful conversations with s. beane , t. cohen , r. furnstahl , d. kaplan , g. rupak , and b. serot , are gratefully acknowledged .",
