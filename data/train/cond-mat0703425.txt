    "superconducting circuits are promising because of their potential scalability and because many of their parameters are tunable over a broad range .    scaling up present - day circuit qed can be done by increasing the number of qubits , the number of oscillators , or both .",

    "the two diabatic states interact with a strength @xmath8 , so that the adiabatic states ( or : time - dependent eigenstates ) differ from the diabatic states .",
    "as is usual , the adiabatic energies are found as the time - dependent eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  ( [ h_lzstandard ] ) .",
    "these are @xmath9 , showing the archetypical avoided level crossing .",
    "the gap between these two adiabatic energies is at least @xmath10 , and the minimum occurs at time @xmath5 .",
    "more intriguing is the dynamics of the state @xmath11 as described by the hamiltonian  ( [ h_lzstandard ] ) . except around @xmath5 , the hamiltonian ( [ h_lzstandard ] )",

    "the dynamics at all times can be expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions @xcite . instead of presenting this dynamics in full glory here",
    ", we will give the following useful summary of the dynamics @xmath16 in terms of the exact scattering matrix ( or s - matrix ) @xmath17 here the quantity @xmath18 stands for @xmath19 and the stokes phase @xmath20 , with adiabaticity parameter @xmath21 and @xmath22 the euler gamma function .",
    "it follows that the probability @xmath23 that the atom ends up in the initially unoccupied level @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 this is the famous landau - zener transition probability .",
    "it is an exact result for all @xmath8 and @xmath7 . instead of using the properties of parabolic cylinder functions to derive this result , which is the standard method ,",

    "the latter method is less well known , but it is an important one , since it is this perturbation method that can be used to analyze landau - zener transitions in more complex systems as well @xcite , where an analysis in terms of special functions is not available .",
