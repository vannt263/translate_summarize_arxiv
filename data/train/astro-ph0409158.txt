    "observations of optical interstellar absorption lines toward early - type galactic stars have long been used to investigate the structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the milky way .",
    "for example , mnch ( 1953 ; 1957 ) examined interstellar nai  and caiiabsorption lines in the spectra of 112 distant , bright , early - type stars to determine if the velocity profiles showed any systematic features that would provide evidence for the large - scale distribution of interstellar clouds .",
    "these observations revealed substantial concentrations of interstellar gas toward perseus and cepheus that were coincident with the recently recognized spiral arm features of the milky way ( morgan , sharpless , & osterbrock 1952 ) .",
    "in addition to recognizing the advantage of using interstellar absorption lines toward clusters and associations to map large - scale ( @xmath7  pc ) interstellar structures in the galaxy , mnch ( 1953 ) also remarked that interstellar absorption line spectra show appreciable variation for stars within the same cluster . thus , interstellar absorption lines could also be used to examine the small - scale variations of interstellar structures ( @xmath8  pc ) in the diffuse ism .    recently , high spatial resolution radio and optical studies of the diffuse ism have found significant evidence for small - scale structures in the ism .",
    "observations of hi  21-cm absorption toward extended extragalactic radio sources ( dieter , welch , & romney 1976 ; diamond et al . 1989 ; faison et al . 1998 ; faison & goss 2001 ) and high - velocity pulsars ( frail et al .",
    "1994 ) have suggested the presence of structure in diffuse clouds on scales of tens of aus .",

    "these observations have revealed interstellar structure on scales of @xmath10  au for high proper motion stars , @xmath11  au for binary stars , and @xmath12  au for globular clusters .    at present , the precise nature of these small - scale features is not well understood .",
    "assuming spherical geometries , the hivolume densities of the small - scale clouds detected in 21-cm absorption are @xmath13(hi ) @xmath14  @xmath15 with inferred thermal pressures of p@xmath16  @xmath15  k ( heiles 1997 ) .",
    "thus , these small - scale features are significantly over - pressured with respect to the ambient ism and should dissipate on time - scales of @xmath17  yrs .",
    "consequently , they should not be a frequently detected component of the ism . in order to resolve this discrepancy ,",
    "several alternatives have been proposed .",
    "heiles ( 1997 ) suggested that the small - scale absorbing features may be cylinders seen face - on or disks seen edge - on , instead of having spherical geometries .",
    "deshpande ( 2000 ) has suggested that the small - scale hi  absorbers represent the tail - end of hierarchical structure in the ism and that the measured transverse size of the absorbing clouds is not necessarily indicative of the depth through the absorbing clouds . in the optical , studies of small - scale structure in the ism using interstellar nai  d  absorption",
    "are hindered by the fact that nai   is not a dominant ion in diffuse clouds .",
    "thus , it is possible that the structures detected using interstellar nai  d  absorption are not changes in the physical structure of the gas but rather caused by fluctuations in the physical conditions of the gas such as cloud temperature , pressure , electron density , and/or radiation field .",
    "thus , it is uncertain if the variations detected on small scales are caused by changes in the density of the interstellar gas , changes in the ionization balance , cloud geometry or a combination of all these effects ( pan , federman , & welty 2001 ) .    in order to further investigate the small - scale structure of the ism",
    ", we have used the hydra multi - object spectrograph on the 3.5-m wiyn at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) to obtain moderate resolution ( @xmath18  km  s@xmath2 ) interstellar nai  d  absorption spectra of 172 stars toward the double open cluster h and @xmath3  persei ( ngc  869 and ngc 884 , respectively ) .",

    "the analysis of these data is described in  3 .",
    "we interpret our results in  4 . in  5 , we summarize our results .",
    "the kpno wiyn observations of h and @xmath3 per were obtained in 1998 september and october using the hydra multi - object spectrograph in queue mode . using the red cable fibers ( 2@xmath20 diameter )",
    ", hydra can observe up to about 90 objects at a time over a 60@xmath21 diameter field with a minimum fiber separation of 37@xmath20 .",
    "two hydra configurations per cluster were observed in order to circumvent this minimum spacing limitation . as shown in figure  1 ,",
    "a total of 172 stars were observed with angular separations ranging from 11.5@xmath20 to 4950@xmath20 which would correspond to linear separations ranging from about 0.1 pc to 50 pc at the double cluster distance of @xmath222000  pc .",
    "the spectrograph was configured with the red bench camera , a tek 2048 ccd ( t2kc ) , the echelle grating , and an interference filter ( x17 ) providing spectral coverage from 5725 to 5965   at a 2.0 pixel resolution of 0.24   or 12  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we present the 150 moderate resolution ( 12  km  s@xmath2 ) spectra along the sightlines that show interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption in perseus spiral arm gas in figure  2 .    utilizing this instrumental setup , net exposures ranging from 1800 to 3600 s",
    "were taken of the h and @xmath3 per stars under clear sky conditions characterized by 12@xmath20 seeing .",
    "the individual ccd frames were background - corrected , flat - fielded , combined , and wavelength - calibrated using the noao iraf data reduction package in order to extract the net stellar spectrum yielded by each illuminated fiber . based on previous observations with this spectrograph and on data comparisons with the kpno coud feed spectrograph",

    "the resulting na i spectra of the 172 stars observed toward h and @xmath3 per have pixel - to - pixel s / n ratios ranging from @xmath2240 to @xmath22300 .",
    "the kpno coud feed spectrograph observations of stars in h and @xmath3 per were obtained in 2001 november and 2002 november using camera 5 with the echelle grating and a ford 3000@xmath261000 pixel ccd chip .",

    "a total of 24 stars were observed with spectra covering the region between @xmath275400 and 6800 . except for the very brightest stars ( for which exposure times of 1800 and 2700s were used ) individual exposures were 3600s long , with total exposure times ranging up to 5 hours . for the majority of the stars exposures",
    "were taken on different nights at different grating tilts to reduce the effect of any flaws in the ccd chip . however , due to poor weather it was not possible to get more than one exposure for 6 of the brighter stars in the sample .",
    "exposures of blank sky were obtained during each run for background subtraction purposes , and in addition observations of the stars @xmath28 aql and @xmath28 leo were obtained each night as a template for dividing out telluric absorption .",
    "these 24 stars were selected from the larger wiyn sample to provide good coverage of the clusters , and because they had sufficiently large ultra - violet fluxes ( as well as large @xmath29 ) to be observed using the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) satellite .",
    "reduction of the data was done with the noao iraf echelle data reduction package .",
    "the individual frames were first bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , then the scattered light was removed .",
    "the individual orders were then optimally extracted and cleaned of cosmic - ray hits using the variance weighted extraction method ( horne 1986 ; marsh 1989 ) .",
    "all of the resulting one - dimensional spectra then had the night sky background ( including nai  d  emission lines ) removed using appropriately scaled exposures of blank sky taken during each run .",
    "the sky - subtracted one - dimensional spectra were then wavelength calibrated , corrected for telluric absorption , shifted to heliocentric coordinates , summed , and finally continuum fitted using low - order polynomials .",

    "the resulting signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios for these observations are typically 4050 per pixel , with two faint stars having s / n - ratios of 3035 , and some of the brighter stars having s / n - ratios of 6080 per pixel .",
    "our analysis includes a discussion of the identification of stars used as background sources in our sample and an assessment of their cluster membership .",
    "we then describe the observed trends in the interstellar nai  d  absorption of the perseus spiral arm gas ( @xmath30  km  s@xmath2 ) toward h and @xmath3  per as revealed by our moderate resolution wiyn data and our high - resolution coud feed data . in the discussion and figures we primarily focus on examining the interstellar",
    "na i d2 absorption toward h and x per in order to better show the weaker features in the gas associated with the perseus spiral arm , although in our analysis we have also considered the weaker d1 profile .      before identifying the stars in our wiyn sample , we first examined the spectra and removed the stars which showed no interstellar nai  dabsorption in the perseus arm gas .",
    "after this was completed , 150 of 172 stars remained in our sample .",
    "the identification of these 150 stars was then made by searching the simbad database for stars within a 1@xmath31 radius of the positions of the @xmath32 hydra spectrograph fibers and yielded the identities of 88 stars in our sample .",
    "this search was subsequently repeated using search radii of 2@xmath31 and 4@xmath31 .",
    "even when the search radius relaxed to 4@xmath31 , the majority of stars ( 125 stars ) only have one designation in the simbad database .",
    "the remaining stars have either two ( 22 stars ) or three ( 3 stars ) possible designations . in order to determine which of the multiple stellar identifications were more likely",
    ", we examined the digital sky survey plates toward h and @xmath3  per and determined the stellar identification based on the positions and brightness of the stars .",
    "after the stars used as background sources in this study were identified , we investigated the cluster membership of the stars by comparing our list of identifications with that of slesnick , hillenbrand , & massey ( 2002 ) . in this manner , we determined a cluster membership of h  per , @xmath3  per , or neither for the stars in our sample .",
    "for stars in our sample that slesnick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) do not recognize as members of either h  per or @xmath3  per , we assigned the stars to either an h  per or @xmath3  per `` field '' based on the stars projected distances to the cluster cores ( h  per : @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; @xmath3  per : @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this resulted in 74 stars in our sample as being projected toward h  per and 76 stars lying projected toward @xmath3  per .",
    "after stars in our moderate ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ) resolution hydra sample were identified and assigned to one of the clusters , we can begin to examine the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  ( 5889 ) absorption toward each cluster .",
    "to investigate the variations in interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption toward each cluster , we sorted the spectra into declination bins and arranged them from east to west , roughly corresponding to their position on the sky .",
    "we present the interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption spectra toward @xmath3 and h  per in figures  2a & b , respectively . in figure  2",
    "we have labeled the spectra with the appropriate stellar identifications from the henry draper ( hd ; cannon & pickering 1918 ) , bonner durchmusterung ( bd ; argelander 1903 ) , and oosterhoff ( oo ; oosterhoff 1937 ) catalogs .",
    "the eleven unlabeled spectra in figure  2 have identifications , but they are not listed in the three aforementioned catalogs .",
    "where applicable , we have designated the cluster memberships of stars in figure  2 , as determined by slesnick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and also labeled stars within a @xmath37 radius of the respective cluster cores .    our hydra interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line profiles reveal a very complex velocity structure from point - to - point over the spatial extent of @xmath3 and h  per . in addition to the saturated interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption by local , low velocity gas ( @xmath38  km  s@xmath2 ) in the orion spiral arm , the spectra toward @xmath3 and h  per   show interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption at intermediate ( @xmath39  km  s@xmath2 ) and higher ( @xmath40  km  s@xmath2 ) velocities that is associated with the perseus spiral arm .",
    "as seen in figure  2 , all of these spectra show different interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption profiles for gas in the perseus spiral arm , i.e. , no two profiles are identical .",
    "the moderate resolution interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line spectra toward @xmath3 and h  per  can be classified as having one of three different shapes : ( 1 ) blended with no distinct peaks in the perseus arm gas ( e.g. , oo2794 , oo892 ) ; ( 2 ) one distinct peak in the perseus arm gas with an extended wing suggesting more components ( e.g. , bd@xmath4156560 , hd14162 ) ; and ( 3 ) two distinct peaks in the perseus arm gas ( e.g. , bd@xmath4156610 , hd14186 ) . the vast majority of the absorption line spectra ( @xmath42 ) toward h and @xmath3  per  fall into the second classification category .",
    "as we discuss in  3.3 , higher resolution ( @xmath4  km  s@xmath2 ) kpno coud feed spectra reveal a multitude of interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption components along any particular sightline . therefore , some care must be exercised to avoid over - interpreting the moderate resolution ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ) spectra .",
    "we discuss the moderate resolution interstellar nai  d@xmath23   absorption spectra toward each cluster in more detail below .",
    "the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line profiles toward @xmath3  per   ( figure  2a ) reveal a very chaotic structure in terms of both velocity and intensity variations in the perseus arm gas .",
    "as previously mentioned , we have arranged the spectra in figure  2a so that their location in the figure approximates the spatial distribution of the stars toward the cluster .",
    "thus , we will discuss variations in the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line profiles in terms of their strength , or optical depth ( @xmath43 $ ] ) , in a given velocity range as a function of their spatial distribution across the cluster .    in the northeastern region of @xmath3  per ,",
    "the interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption profiles are asymmetric . the interstellar absorption associated with the higher velocity ( @xmath40  km  s@xmath2 ) gas appears as an extended blue wing in the line profile and the intermediate velocity ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 ) gas appears as a bump on the line profile between the higher velocity component and the saturated low velocity orion arm gas .",
    "in contrast , the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption of perseus arm gas is more apparent toward the rest of the stars in this field . toward the core of @xmath3  per  the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption is stronger in both the higher and intermediate velocity components of the perseus arm gas .",
    "consequently , the majority of spectra along these sightlines seem to be double - peaked where the higher and intermediate velocity perseus arm components appear blended together as one component and the low velocity orion arm gas appears as the other component .",
    "an examination of figure  2a reveals one trend in these `` double - peaked '' spectra . in the upper left quadrant of figure  2a ( northeast region of @xmath3  per ) , the blended perseus arm component has a local minimum to the blue of @xmath45  km  s@xmath2 . in the lower right section of figure  2a ( southwest region of @xmath3  per ) , the local minimum lies to the red of @xmath45  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that absorption due to the intermediate velocity gas in the perseus arm becomes stronger with respect to the higher velocity perseus arm gas in the southwest .",
    "the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption profiles toward @xmath3  per  that show two distinct peaks in the perseus arm gas in addition to the low velocity orion arm gas ( e.g. , bd@xmath4156549 and bd@xmath4156610 ) are primarily located away from the cluster core .",
    "our moderate resolution interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line spectra toward h  per  ( figure  2b ) also reveal complex structure in the perseus arm gas .",
    "similar to our analysis of the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line profiles toward @xmath3  per , we have arranged the spectra shown in figure  2b so that their location in the figure approximates the spatial distribution of our sightlines toward the cluster .    although the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption profiles toward h  per  ( figure  2b ) are similar to those seen toward @xmath3  per   ( figure  2a ) , they generally show stronger interstellar nai  d@xmath23   absorption in the perseus arm gas . in the northern and eastern regions of h  per  the line profiles",
    "reveal very strong interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption where the higher and intermediate velocity perseus arm gas are blended into one component that has a line depth comparable to the orion arm gas .",
    "furthermore , there is little separation between the peak of the blended perseus arm component and the orion arm gas , indicating a substantial amount of intermediate velocity perseus arm gas . toward the core of h  per",
    "a noticeable separation appears between the perseus arm gas and the orion arm gas and the peak of the higher and intermediate velocity gas blend has shifted to the blue , suggesting that the intermediate velocity perseus arm component is decreasing in strength with respect to the higher velocity perseus arm gas .",
    "this apparent trend continues along the southwestern periphery of h  per .",
    "the gap between the perseus arm gas and the orion arm gas is even more pronounced than toward the core of h  per .",
    "it is also apparent in figure  2b that the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption in the higher velocity perseus arm gas in the southwestern region is strong and is very likely saturated .      in order to better understand the variations in intensity and velocity of interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption , we have also obtained high - resolution ( @xmath4  km  s@xmath2 ) spectra toward 24 of the brightest stars projected along the line - of - sight to h and @xmath3  per . in figure  3 , we present the high - resolution interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption spectra of stars toward h and @xmath3  per . we have arranged the spectra in figure  3 to show the relative positions of the background target stars , similar to our method of analysis for the moderate resolution data .",
    "the coordinate offsets provided in the lower left of each panel indicate the relative position of any particular sightline with respect to hd14250 , which lies approximately between the cluster cores .",
    "thus , stars to the west of hd14250 are projected toward h  per  and stars to the east of it are projected toward @xmath3  per . to aid in the comparison between the high - resolution and moderate resolution data , we have plotted the high - resolution spectra in figure  3 on the same intensity and velocity scale as the spectra presented in figure  2 .",
    "the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line spectra presented in figure  3 show the vast complexity of interstellar gas toward h and @xmath3  per  that was first noted by mnch ( 1953 ; 1957 ) .",
    "these high - resolution data reveal variations in interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption in an even more dramatic fashion than the moderate resolution data .",
    "the individual components change in number , velocity , and strength from sightline to sightline .",
    "for example , the moderate resolution interstellar nai  d@xmath23spectra of bd@xmath4156578 and bd@xmath4156571 , separated by @xmath27 25 , are quite similar ( see figure  2a ) ; the most apparent difference is slightly more interstellar absorption at intermediate velocities toward bd@xmath4156571 .",
    "it is difficult to discern from the moderate resolution data if this subtle variation is the result of a change in the relative intensity and/or velocity of the intermediate velocity gas in front of these stars or if the variation is indicative of an additional intermediate velocity component that is present toward bd@xmath4156571 , but not toward bd@xmath4156578 .",
    "the high - resolution coud feed spectra ( see figure  3 ) clearly reveal the presence of an extra intermediate velocity absorption component toward bd@xmath4156571 .",
    "thus , the moderate resolution ( @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 ) spectra provide a gross description of interstellar nai  d@xmath23   absorption toward the double open cluster , but the higher resolution spectra are necessary to understand the details of the interstellar absorption .    the high - resolution spectra shown in figure  3 do not reveal any apparent patterns in the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption toward h and @xmath3  per .",
    "in general , the high - resolution spectra reveal a multitude of interstellar absorption components along any given sightline and no two high - resolution spectra are identical . toward @xmath3",
    "per , eight of the ten sightlines lie within a @xmath37 ( @xmath4  pc ) radius of the cluster core .",
    "these sightlines have angular separations that range from @xmath47 ( @xmath48  pc ) to @xmath49 ( @xmath50  pc ) , with an average angular separation of @xmath51 ( @xmath52  pc ) .",
    "even these closely - spaced sightlines overwhelmingly show the chaotic interstellar absorption structure in the perseus arm gas with individual components varying in velocity and strength on the smallest angular scales probed .",
    "for example , bd@xmath4156574 and bd@xmath4156575 have an angular separation of @xmath53 ( @xmath54  pc at the distance to @xmath3  per ) , yet the interstellar absorption of intermediate velocity perseus arm gas toward bd@xmath4156574 is much more pronounced .",
    "in contrast to @xmath3  per , only four of the fourteen sightlines toward h  per  are projected within a @xmath37 ( @xmath4  pc ) radius of the cluster core with angular separations ranging from @xmath55 ( @xmath6  pc ) to @xmath56 ( @xmath57  pc ) and an average angular separation of @xmath58 ( @xmath59  pc ) .",
    "of these four stars , hd14134 and bd@xmath4156524 have the smallest angular separation of @xmath60 ( @xmath6  pc at the distance to h  per ) .",
    "the moderate resolution spectra toward these two stars are vaguely similar and show fairly strong interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption in the intermediate and higher velocity perseus arm gas .",
    "the high - resolution spectra , however , show dramatic differences .",
    "the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption spectrum toward hd14134 shows two saturated components at @xmath61 and @xmath62  km  s@xmath2  as well as a fairly well - defined gap between the perseus and orion arm gas .",
    "the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption spectrum toward bd@xmath4156524 , on the other hand , shows relatively strong absorption at all velocities associated with perseus arm gas such that no gap is apparent between it and the orion arm gas",
    ".    a comparison between the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption spectra toward @xmath3  per  with respect to the spectra toward h  per  does not reveal many obvious trends .",
    "it appears as if the interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption toward h  per  is generally more saturated than toward @xmath3  per .",
    "to further examine these spectra for any discernible patterns in the interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption , we created gray - scale images of the high - resolution spectra and arranged them spatially from west to east as shown in figure  4 .",
    "in this figure , we also indicate the average heliocentric velocities of h and @xmath3  per  at @xmath63 and @xmath64  km  s@xmath2  ( liu , janes , & bania 1989 ) , respectively . in this image ,",
    "strong nai  d@xmath23  absorption is black , more moderate absorption is gray , and low absorption is white .",
    "these absorption line images confirm the impression that there is more interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption toward h  per .",
    "the most noticeable feature in the spectral line images shown in figure  4 is the presence of enhanced interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption toward h  per  at @xmath65  km  s@xmath2  that is not seen toward @xmath3  per .",
    "we discuss the nature of this @xmath66  km  s@xmath2absorption in more detail in  4.3 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath66  km  s@xmath2   component that is only detected toward h  per , we also notice a component that in present in most , if not all , of our high - resolution spectra between @xmath45 and @xmath67  km  s@xmath2",
    ". this velocity component may be indicative of a large - scale interstellar structure toward h and @xmath3  per  associated with the perseus spiral arm .",
    "many observations have been reported that detail the structure seen in interstellar nai  absorption toward high proper motion stars , binaries , open clusters , and globular clusters . in this section ,",
    "we compare the interstellar nai  absorption toward h and @xmath3  per  with observations toward other open clusters and ob associations where it may be possible to use multi - object spectroscopy to investigate interstellar absorption toward a large number of sightlines .",
    "these comparisons may allow us to discern common properties of interstellar nai  absorption toward clusters of early - type stars .",
    "then , we investigate the question of what characteristics define an interstellar cloud . finally , we discuss the nature and origin of the @xmath66  km  s@xmath2  interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption component that is detected toward h  per , but not toward @xmath3  per .      among the first `` stationary '' or interstellar lines reported ( heger 1919 ) , nai  d  observations have a long history of being used to probe the structure of the ism .",
    "furthermore , the interstellar nai  d  absorption lines are among the strongest optical interstellar absorption lines typically detected .",
    "thus , we begin our discussion of the complex interstellar structure toward h and @xmath3  per  by examining past studies of interstellar nai  d  absorption toward open clusters and ob associations . through this",
    ", we can examine whether the velocity and intensity variations in interstellar nai  d  absorption toward h and @xmath3  per  are commonly seen toward clusters of early - type stars and how this affects our understanding of the ism in the galaxy .",
    "as mentioned previously , moderate resolution ( @xmath68  km  s@xmath2 ) interstellar caii  and nai  absorption observations toward 112 stars in the northern milky way were obtained by mnch ( 1953 ; 1957 ) as part of a larger program to determine if the interstellar lines in distant stars might reveal the large - scale structure of interstellar gas in the galaxy . of these stars , 16 are members of the perseus ob1 association and are projected toward h and @xmath3  per . mnch ( 1953 ; 1957 ) determined that the interstellar nai  d  absorption line spectra toward h and @xmath3  per  showed two distinct components : ( 1 ) a blue - shifted `` v '' component associated with interstellar gas in the perseus spiral arm and ( 2 ) a highly saturated `` r '' component associated with the local orion spiral arm gas . in particular , mnch ( 1953 ) noted that the shape of the line profiles of the perseus arm gas suggested that this `` v '' component resulted from the superposition of a number of fainter narrow lines and that the the shape of the `` v '' component varied widely from star to star in both velocity and intensity .",
    "the detailed analysis of these data shows that some of the interstellar nai  absorption in the `` v '' component with radial velocities that are comparable to those of the background stars and a component in the perseus arm gas that is systematically shifted to the violet with respect to stars by @xmath69  km  s@xmath2 . as seen in figure  4 , this component is detected in our high - resolution kpno coud feed spectra toward h and @xmath3  per  as an interstellar nai  d  absorption feature at heliocentric velocities between @xmath45 and @xmath67  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "mnch ( 1957 ) has suggested that this blue - shifted velocity component could be indicative of a coherent expansion of interstellar gas around the ob associations and open clusters in the perseus spiral arm .    in order to better understand the nature of the nai  absorption toward the perseus arm , mnch ( 1957 )",
    "compared the interstellar nai  d  profiles with hi  21-cm emission line data .",
    "mnch ( 1957 ) determined that the peaks seen in 21-cm emission had similar velocities to the troughs seen in nai  absorption , leading him to conclude that the observed nai  lines must predominantly arise in hi  regions .",
    "furthermore , mnch ( 1957 ) noted that the optical absorption line profiles show more variations on smaller scales than the 21-cm emission line profiles because the beam size of the radio observations ( @xmath70 ) samples many more interstellar clouds along the line - of - sight than an individual interstellar absorption sightline .",
    "thus , the hi  data may be able to provide information on the large - scale structure of the ism and absorption line studies are better suited to examine small - scale variations .      as much as h and @xmath3  per  are among the most studied nearby galactic clusters accessible to northern telescopes , the carina nebula ( ngc  3372 ) and its associated open clusters trumpler  16 and collinder  228 ( hereafter tr  16 and cr  228 , respectively ) are among the most studied southern objects .",

    "subsequent nai  observations toward stars in tr  16 and cr  228 ( whiteoak & gardner 1980 ; walborn 1982 ; garca & walborn 2000 ) have revealed complex interstellar nai  d  absorption toward the carina nebula in which none of the line profiles are identical .",

    "concluded that the interstellar nai  d  absorption at intermediate velocities ( @xmath81  km  s@xmath2 ) could be interpreted as arising in the front side of an expanding shell because these velocity components are similar to those seen in nebular emission lines .",

    "they also report that the structure of the interstellar absorption line profiles change on very small angular scales that may be attributed to small differences in distance to the stars .",

    "the differences in the absorption line profiles are most apparent for gas that is located in other spiral arms of the galaxy , however , nearby sightlines toward the pleiades and stars in orion also show considerable variations in the interstellar nai  d  profiles .",
    "furthermore , significant differences among the line profiles toward stars in each cluster can be seen down to the minimum projected stellar separations of @xmath120  pc ( e.g. , see figures  2 & 3 ) .",
    "thus , it would seem that the variations observed in interstellar nai  d  absorption toward stars in open clusters and ob associations are a relatively common phenomenon . as previously discussed , it remains uncertain if the differences in the interstellar nai  d  absorption line profiles are tracing density variations in interstellar gas , fluctuations in the ionization balance , the geometry of interstellar material , or a combination of these and other effects .",
    "the first interstellar absorption line reported was detected toward the spectroscopic binary @xmath119  ori by hartmann ( 1904 ) , who noted that the caii  k  line did not share in the periodic variations of the stellar lines but remained `` stationary '' throughout the observations .",
    "subsequently , stationary lines of caii  k  were detected in the spectra of other stars such as @xmath121  leo ( harper 1914 ) .",
    "this phenomenon was extended by heger ( 1919 ) when stationary lines of nai  d@xmath25  and d@xmath23 were discovered in the spectra of @xmath119  ori and @xmath122  sco .",
    "heger ( 1919 ) also noted that the velocities of the stationary nai  d  lines in these spectra matched the previously measured velocities of stationary caii  h  and k lines toward these stars within the observational errors .",
    "the origin of the stationary lines remained in dispute for approximately 25 years after their discovery .",
    "the two predominant theories to explain the nature of the stationary lines were that ( 1 ) the lines were due to absorption of the background stellar continuum by an intervening cloud of calcium and/or sodium in space or ( 2 ) that the lines were due to a calcium and/or sodium envelope that surrounded the stellar source . until 1923",
    ", the stationary lines had only been detected toward high temperature spectroscopic binaries  leo is not a spectroscopic binary .",
    "harper ( 1914 ) considered @xmath121  leo to be a spectroscopic binary based on a report by campbell & albrecht ( 1909 ) even though he was unable to determine a period for the star from his own data . ] with spectral types between b0 and b3 .",
    "based on this evidence , young ( 1920 ) concluded that the stationary lines are most likely produced in a low density gas that was associated with the binary systems .",
    "plaskett ( 1923 ) challenged this conclusion , however , when his investigation of the spectra of @xmath123 o - type and wolf - rayet stars revealed that stationary lines of caii  h  and k were present toward all of the stars in his sample regardless if the star were a binary or singular .",
    "furthermore , plaskett ( 1923 ) found that the velocities of the stationary h and k lines differed considerably from the velocities of stellar lines in the spectra by as much as @xmath124  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , plaskett ( 1923 ) concluded that diffuse gaseous matter containing ionized calcium ( and neutral sodium ) arise in a fairly widespread cloud of tenuous material that is not local to the background star , but was interstellar gas .",
    "the physical conditions of diffuse interstellar gas was first investigated by eddington ( 1926 ) . using general physical considerations , eddington ( 1926 )",
    "estimated that the diffuse interstellar gas had a density of @xmath125  g  @xmath15 , a temperature of @xmath126  k , and was uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy .",
    "thus , interstellar absorption lines should be present in the spectra of stars of all classes and the strength of the absorption should increase with distance to the background star . because the detection of interstellar absorption in the spectra of late - type stars is problematic due to the increasing strength and narrow width of stellar absorption lines , most investigations of interstellar absorption focused on the spatial distribution of the gas toward early - type stars .",
    "struve ( 1928 ) systematically measured the intensity of interstellar caii  k  toward 1718 early - type stars that ranged in apparent magnitude by 10.5  mag and found that the line strength linearly increased with apparent magnitude and presumably with distance . in order to determine the relative distances between the star and the center of absorption in a cloud by using the theory of differential galactic rotation ( lindblad 1927 ) , plaskett & pearce ( 1930 ) measured the stellar and interstellar caii  k  line velocities toward @xmath113  ob stars .",
    "plaskett & pearce ( 1930 ) found that the galactic rotational term of stars was approximately twice the galactic rotational term of the gas and concluded that the absorbing gas was uniformly distributed .",
    "photometric measurements of interstellar line intensities led to the conclusion that the interstellar gas was not homogeneous , but that the observed line profiles could be accounted for by making the hypothesis that interstellar gas occurs in discrete clouds which participate in the general galactic rotation in addition to having significant random motions ( wilson & merrill 1937 ) .",
    "the discovery of the ism through absorption line spectroscopy led to what can be described as a `` standard cloud '' model in which each velocity component comprising an interstellar absorption line profile in stellar spectra corresponds to an individual cloud with a radius of a few parsecs ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "statistically , about five of these standard clouds are detected per kiloparsec along any particular sightline ( hobbs 1974 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that advances in spectral resolution have radically altered this simple picture .",
    "as higher spectral resolutions are achieved , the number of discrete absorption components along any particular line - of - sight tends to increase .",
    "beals ( 1936 ) first reported the `` irregularity of structure '' in the interstellar absorption profiles toward stars in orion ( e.g. , @xmath119  ori and @xmath117  ori ) that indicated the presence of two interstellar clouds .",
    "as discussed in  4.1.6 , the ultra - high resolution observations of interstellar absorption toward stars in orion ( price et al .",
    "2001b ) reveal up to 10 and 12 interstellar clouds toward @xmath119  ori and @xmath117  ori , respectively .",
    "thus , the `` standard cloud '' model of the ism which was constructed on the interpretation of moderate resolution interstellar absorption spectra can not adequately describe the ism as viewed at ultra - high resolution .",
    "consequently , the definition of an interstellar cloud strongly depends upon the resolution with which it is observed .",
    "the view of the ism as determined from interstellar absorption is sharply contrasted with the appearance of the ism as determined from emission line imaging studies which reveals the ism to be comprised of loops , filaments , shells , and sheets of gas .",
    "thus , the relationship between interstellar structures seen in emission and interstellar clouds inferred from absorption is not clear .",
    "a fundamental problem in reconciling the differences between these views of the ism is pencil - beam nature of interstellar absorption line investigations and the larger beam sizes of hi  21-cm emission line surveys .",
    "one approach in attacking this problem is to map interstellar absorption lines of intervening gas toward open clusters and ob associations by obtaining many spectra along sightlines which probe a range of angular separations through the use of multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "we have seen in  4.1 that observations of interstellar nai  toward stars in open clusters ( e.g. , h & @xmath3  per , tr  16 & cr  228 , & the pleiades ) and ob associations ( e.g. , ara  ob1 & sco  ob1 ) reveal complex absorption line profiles . as shown in figure  2 , all of the sightlines toward the 150 stars in the vicinity of h and @xmath3  per  for which we have obtained wiyn hydra moderate resolution spectra exhibit different nai  d  line profiles for every sightline .",
    "the variations in the absorption line profiles are most easily seen in optically - thin perseus spiral arm gas with velocities between @xmath127 and @xmath66  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , these variations can be seen down to the minimum angular separation of @xmath128 which corresponds to a projected physical separation of @xmath129  pc at the distance to the perseus gas . as shown in figure  3 , the nai  d  profile variations are even more dramatic in our high - resolution kpno coud feed spectra toward 24 of the h and @xmath3  per  stars which have angular separations as small as @xmath5 ( @xmath48  pc ) .    in the `` standard '' cloud model ,",
    "each of the interstellar naiabsorption components seen toward h and @xmath3  per  represents an individual , spherical , isothermal cloud with a diameter of @xmath130  pc ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "thus , at the 2  kpc distance to the perseus spiral arm , the minimum angular size of a `` standard '' interstellar cloud along the line - of - sight would be @xmath131 .",
    "as seen in figure  3 , along any given sightline toward h and @xmath3  per  for which we have obtained high - resolution interstellar nai  absorption spectra , the approximate number of components it would take to adequately fit the line profile is @xmath132 for the gas in the perseus arm ( @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , the assumption that each detected interstellar nai  absorption component arises from within an individual cloud gives rise to a complicated situation where the ism of of the perseus spiral arm would appear to consist of hundreds of individual clouds .    given the size of a `` standard '' cloud and its projected angular diameter at the distance of h and @xmath3  per , it is not unreasonable to assume that some fraction of the absorption lines that are detected along different sightlines arise in the same `` cloud '' . some of the sightlines with the smallest angular separations between them have fairly distinct interstellar nai  absorption spectra .",
    "for example , hd  14443 and bd@xmath4156571 toward @xmath3  per  have an angular separation of @xmath133 .",
    "of the five easily discernible spectral components in the perseus arm gas toward hd  14443 ( see figure  5a ) , only those components with intensity minima at @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136  km  s@xmath2  appear to directly correspond to absorption features seen toward bd@xmath4156571 , i.e. , the shift in the absorption troughs at these velocities is less than 3.5  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "hd  14134 and bd@xmath4156524 in h  per  have an angular separation of @xmath137 . likewise ,",
    "as seen above , only three of the five obvious absorption components toward hd  14134 at @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140  km  s@xmath2  appear to directly correspond to features toward bd@xmath4156524 ( see figure  5b ) .",
    "thus , these data show that although some of the detected gas is seen toward adjacent stars , some is not .",
    "it remains uncertain , however , over what velocity interval we can legitimately call interstellar nai  absorption components toward different sightlines one cloud . for example , if we were to analyze each sightline toward h and @xmath3  per  in isolation , we would need at least 5 absorption components to adequately fit the interstellar absorption detected in the perseus arm gas , implying the presence of at least that many clouds along the line - of - sight .",
    "if we were to examine interstellar absorption spectra along two nearby sightlines , we would observe @xmath50 absorption components toward each star , but 23 of the components would be seen toward both stars . this effectively reduces the number of clouds along the line - of - sight in the perseus arm gas from 10 to 7 or 8 toward those two stars .",
    "it is only when a relatively large number of stars are included in the analysis that one can begin to discern the larger scale structures in the ism toward h and @xmath3  per .",
    "for example , we detect interstellar nai  d  absorption at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath141  km  s@xmath2toward most of the stars for which we have obtained high - resolution spectra that is suggestive of a large - scale interstellar feature toward the double cluster that appears to contain medium and small scale variations within it . furthermore , it is possible that the velocity dispersion of this cloud as a whole is larger than the velocity dispersion measured for the density peaks within this cloud that are determined from the individual spectra .",
    "thus , these individual density peaks could have heliocentric velocities that differ by several  km  s@xmath2 , but nevertheless are part of a larger cloud .",
    "the view that some of the differences in interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption detected among sightlines represents variations within larger scale absorption systems is not without precedent .",
    "the ultra - high resolution survey of interstellar absorption toward stars in orion ( price et al .",
    "2001b ) revealed @xmath142 varying velocity components toward stars in the trapezium .",
    "although these ultra - high resolution spectra reveal some similarities in the interstellar absorption profiles , they also reveal clear differences . despite the differences detected in the interstellar absorption features , price et al .",
    "( 2001b ) argue that the data are best explained if the individual velocity components comprise part of a larger interstellar absorption system .",
    "therefore , based on our moderate and high resolution spectra , as well as the qualitative comparison to the ultra - high resolution survey of interstellar absorption toward orion , the individual interstellar absorption components detected toward h and @xmath3  perprobably do not indicate the presence of many small spherical clouds , but rather larger sheets or systems of gas within which we observe variations in the strength , number , and velocity of components due to differences in the physical conditions on smaller scales and within which we detect differences in the gas density .    because nai  is not a dominant species in the ism",
    ", it is usually necessary to observe other interstellar lines in order to determine if the interstellar nai  absorption line components are tracing the physical structure or the physical conditions of the gas .",
    "we have obtained hi  21-cm emission line data toward h and @xmath3  per  from the low resolution drao survey ( lrds ) of the galactic plane ( higgs & tapping 2000 ) to directly compare the nai  d  line profiles with the hi  line profiles . in figure  6 , we show three hi  21-cm line profiles from the lrds that are roughly centered on h  per , @xmath3  per , and an area located between these two clusters . in general , the hi21-cm emission line profiles show smoother , more continuous variations in the perseus arm gas when compared to our coud feed interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption line spectra",
    ". these differences may be due to the @xmath143 beam of the lrds sampling many individual smaller clouds with different velocities along the line - of - sight .",
    "the hi  21-cm emission line profiles show three peaks in the perseus arm gas at velocities of @xmath144 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140  km  s@xmath2  which are similar to some velocity components detected in interstellar nai  absorption . the 21-cm emission at @xmath145  km  s@xmath2  is emission from gas that lies beyond the perseus arm .",
    "of particular interest is the @xmath146  km  s@xmath2  21-cm emission peak because interstellar nai  absorption is detected at velocities between @xmath147  km  s@xmath2  ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "we have examined the lrds hi  datacube of the h and @xmath3  perregion and find that an hi  feature having an angular diameter of @xmath148 ( @xmath149  pc ) and a velocity of @xmath150  km  s@xmath2  is roughly centered on h and @xmath3  per .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath151  km  s@xmath2  component represents an intervening interstellar cloud .",
    "in addition to comparing the interstellar nai  absorption line profiles with hi  21-cm emission toward h and @xmath3  per , we have also examined interstellar absorption from the @xmath152 and @xmath153 diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) . even though not one dib carrier has been positively identified since their discovery by heger ( 1922 ) ,",
    "recent developments indicate that most dib carriers are probably large carbon - bearing gas phase molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , fullerenes , and/or carbon chains ( salama et al .",
    "1996 ; foing & ehrenfruend 1997 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to assume that the dibs trace dense gas that could be indicative of individual clouds toward h and @xmath3  per . unlike the interstellar nai  profiles ,",
    "the dib profiles show little sightline - to - sightline variations and have velocities typically associated with local orion arm and low - velocity perseus arm gas . toward three closely - spaced stars ( angular separations @xmath154 ;",
    "projected linear separations @xmath155  pc ) , however , we have spectroscopically resolved a @xmath156 dib component associated with higher velocity gas in the perseus arm .",
    "our coud feed interstellar absorption spectra toward the two brightest of these stars , bd@xmath4156488 and bd@xmath4156508 ( see figure  7 ) , show an intense , narrow nai  absorption component at @xmath157  km  s@xmath2that is not detected toward any other of the sightlines toward h and @xmath3  per  for which we have obtained high - resolution spectra . because this strong @xmath138  km  s@xmath2 nai  absorption component and the perseus arm @xmath156 dib absorption are only detected toward a small ( @xmath158  pc ) region to the northwest of the core of h  per , it it likely that they trace an isolated interstellar cloud .",
    "although the above two examples show that some interstellar nai  d@xmath23absorption components seen in figure  7 appear to trace discrete clouds in the perseus arm gas , it is uncertain whether the interstellar naiabsorption components at other velocities do .",
    "the variations in the interstellar nai  line profiles at these other velocities may reflect environmental variations in parameters such as temperature , pressure , electron density , and/or radiation field .",
    "the physical conditions of the perseus arm gas , however , can not be determined solely from the interstellar nai  absorption lines .",
    "therefore , we have performed a cursory examination of the spectral types of stars toward h and @xmath3  peras cataloged by slesnick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in order to determine a rough estimate of the local background radiation field . as seen in figures  3 & 4 , even stars with small angular separations in the core of h ( e.g. , hd  14143 and hd  14134 ) and @xmath3  per  ( e.g. , bd@xmath4156571 and bd@xmath4156563 ) with identical spectral classifications",
    "show different interstellar nai  absorption line profiles , indicating that the local background radiation field is not the primary cause of the observed line profile variations . because these stars are not likely at the same distance in the perseus arm , it is also a possibility that the differences in the interstellar nai  line profiles are caused by distance effects .",
    "based upon the data we have examined , the most likely distribution of interstellar material toward h and @xmath3  per  is in the form of several large - scale structures at velocities of @xmath159 , @xmath134 , @xmath139 , @xmath135 , and @xmath66  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the lower velocity gas ( @xmath160  km  s@xmath2 ) is primarily associated with more local , orion spiral arm gas . the intermediate velocity gas ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 ) detected in these spectra is roughly centered on the mean heliocentric radial velocities of both h and @xmath3  per  ( liu , janes , & bania 1989 ) . as such",
    ", these absorption components most likely represent gas in the perseus spiral arm that is local to the clusters .",
    "furthermore , the intermediate velocity interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption at @xmath161  km  s@xmath2  is blue - shifted with respect to the mean heliocentric cluster velocities by @xmath132  km  s@xmath2 . as noted by mnch ( 1953 ; 1957 ) , this blue - shifted component could represent the front side of an expanding shell of gas around the double cluster .",
    "velocity variations among sightlines in this intermediate velocity gas could be due to the non - spherical geometry of an interstellar shell around h and @xmath3  per , such as the orion - eridanus superbubble that is suspected to produce the variable interstellar absorption detected toward @xmath119  ori ( price et al .",
    "these largeer scale interstellar structures have internal velocity dispersions due to turbulence on small scales ( elmegreen 1999 ; cho , lazarian , & vishniac 2002 ) and velocities due to bulk motions on larger scales . within these structures , small and medium scale variations in the physical conditions of the gas",
    "could lead to observed differences in the naicolumn . because recombination rates are strongly dependent upon density ( pquignot & aldrovandi 1986 ) , neutral species such as nai  would preferentially form in these regions of higher density ( lauroesch & meyer 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "this , coupled with the velocity differences among these structures , leads to the very large number of individual nai  components detected toward any particular sightline as well as the differences between sightlines in terms of both the strength and velocity of interstellar naiabsorption .",
    "the higher velocity ( @xmath162  km  s@xmath2 ) interstellar nai  d@xmath23  absorption , especially that which is only detected at @xmath163  km  s@xmath2  toward bd@xmath4156488 and bd@xmath4156508 and also corresponds to enhanced @xmath156 dib absorption , seems to arise in a canonical interstellar cloud ( @xmath164  pc ) .",
    "as discussed in  3.3 , we have detected an enigmatic interstellar nai  absorption component at @xmath65  km  s@xmath2  in the spectra of stars that are projected toward h  per  using our coud feed data ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "this absorption feature is not detected in the coud feed spectra of stars projected toward @xmath3  per . in order to determine the spatial distribution of the @xmath165  km  s@xmath2  absorption component ,",
    "we have re - examined the 150 hydra interstellar naiabsorption spectra toward h and @xmath3  per .",
    "this @xmath165  km  s@xmath2component is not resolved from the broad ( saturated ) absorption centered near @xmath166  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we use the stars in our coud feed sample to estimate the size of the @xmath165  km  s@xmath2absorber even though they have a more limited spatial distribution than the hydra sample . from the angular separations between hd  14092 and bd@xmath4156488 and between hd  14250 and bd@xmath4156485",
    ", we find that the minimum angular extent of the @xmath165  km  s@xmath2  velocity component is at least @xmath167 @xmath26 @xmath168 .",
    "the large angular size of the @xmath165  km  s@xmath2  interstellar naiabsorption component implies that the gas in which this feature appears lies at some distance in front of h  per .",
    "if the gas were relatively close to the cluster , we would expect to see some differences in the line profiles due to the ionizing radiation field from the massive stars in h  per .",
    "thus , the most simple explanation is that the @xmath165  km  s@xmath2  component arises in a discrete neutral cloud at an unknown distance in front of h  per . to confirm this hypothesis ,",
    "we have examined the 21-cm lrds datacube at heliocentric velocities between @xmath75 and @xmath169  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is an ideal method to search for an isolated cloud on large angular scales because these data simultaneously provide kinematic and spatial information on the hidistribution .",
    "we find a 21-cm hi  emission component at @xmath170  km  s@xmath2  that is projected toward h  per , but that is absent toward @xmath3  per , strengthening our conclusion that the @xmath165  km  s@xmath2interstellar nai  absorption feature arises in a gas cloud that lies in front of h  per .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that an investigation of the lrds hi  21-cm emission line profiles toward the cores of h and @xmath3  per , where the majority of stars observed with the coud feed are located , does not show any remarkable enhancements in the neutral gas at this velocity ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "this difference , or lack there - of , in the individual hi  21-cm emission line profiles may be the result of self - absorption of neutral hydrogen in the local gas that affects the shape of the 21-cm line profiles in this velocity range .",
    "we present moderate resolution ( 12  km  s@xmath2 ) interstellar nai  absorption line spectra along 150 sightlines toward the double open cluster h and @xmath3  per  that were obtained with the wiyn hydra multi - object spectrograph .",
    "additionally , we have used the kpno coud feed spectrograph to obtain high - resolution ( 3  km  s@xmath2 ) interstellar naiabsorption line spectra toward 24 of the brightest stars along the line - of - sight to h and @xmath3  per .",
    "these data have been used to examine the interstellar nai  absorption toward h and @xmath3  per  on angular scales from @xmath171 to @xmath172 which correspond to linear scales of 0.1  pc to 50  pc at the double cluster distance of @xmath173  pc . both the moderate and high - resolution spectra reveal complex interstellar nai  absorption toward h and @xmath3  per .",
    "a study of these spectra leads us to the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) multi - object spectroscopy of interstellar absorption toward open clusters is a powerful , but under - utilized tool to examine the structure of the ism .",
    "studies of interstellar absorption and its variations from sightline to sightline have historically been limited to obtaining one spectrum at a time , making it difficult and time consuming to investigate the structure of the ism over a range of scale lengths .",
    "\\(2 ) the moderate resolution wiyn hydra data are remarkable because they show that no two interstellar nai  absorption line profiles are alike over the range of scale lengths probed .",
    "the high - resolution kpno coud feed spectra reveal even more complexity in the perseus arm gas than the moderate resolution hydra spectra with the number , velocity , and strength of individual components changing from sightline to sightline .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained by previous investigations of interstellar nai  absorption toward open clusters and ob associations in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , it seems that the variations which are detected in interstellar nai  absorption line profiles are relatively common .",
    "\\(3 ) the `` standard '' cloud model of the ism in which every individual absorption line component toward each sightline represents an individual interstellar cloud is not applicable to these data .",
    "if each interstellar nai  absorption component detected in our coud feed dataset represents an individual interstellar cloud , the perseus arm gas toward h and @xmath3  per  would appear to consist of many small clouds .",
    "given the finite size of an individual interstellar cloud , the number distribution of clouds along the line - of - sight to h and @xmath3  per , and the range of angular separations of our sightlines , it seems probable that some sightlines should intersect the same parcel of gas .",
    "the difficultly lies in determining over what velocity interval and change in intensity it is appropriate to call interstellar nai  absorption components toward different sightlines one cloud .",
    "it is distinctly possible that the ism in the perseus arm gas is comprised of sheets of gas that have large internal velocity dispersions .",
    "fluctuations in the density within these sheets of gas could give rise to the variations observed in our interstellar absorption line data .",
    "ultra - high resolution interstellar absorption surveys toward orion reveal extremely complex line profiles toward any individual star ( price et al 2001b ) .",
    "although numerous velocity components are detected toward stars in the orion sample , price et al .",
    "( 2001b ) are able to group absorption components into larger absorption systems based upon similarities in velocity and in na@xmath174/ca@xmath175 ratios .",
    "\\(4 ) because nai  is not a dominant species in the ism , it is uncertain if the observed variations in the interstellar absorption line profiles trace changes in the physical structure or the physical conditions of the gas . therefore , other interstellar lines need to be observed , such as caii , ki , or diagnostic uv lines .",
    "although our moderate and high resolution data do not cover these more traditional diagnostic lines , we have also examined the interstellar absorption from the @xmath152 and @xmath156 dibs .",
    "these dibs most likely trace dense gas that could be indicative of individual clouds . toward three closely spaced stars ,",
    "we have spectroscopically resolved a @xmath156 dib component in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "our high - resolution interstellar nai  absorption spectra toward the two brightest of these stars reveal a nearly saturated , narrow absorption component at @xmath157  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is likely that this strong nai  component traces an individual interstellar cloud .",
    "\\(5 ) the comparison between the high - resolution spectra toward @xmath3  per  and h  per  does not reveal many obvious differences between the two clusters",
    ". in general , the interstellar nai  absorption toward h  per  seems more pronounced .",
