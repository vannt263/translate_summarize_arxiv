    "two exotic relatives of the proton and neutron @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) were discovered by cdf collaboration at fermilab @xcite .",

    "the mass of bottomed baryon @xmath11 is @xmath12 mev @xcite , and the mass differences @xmath13 are all larger than @xmath14 , thus the dominate decay modes of these exotic bottomed baryons are the strong decays @xmath15 , which are similar to the ones of charmed baryons @xmath16 . in this paper",
    ", we will combine the chiral dynamics and mit bag model to study the strong decays of the heavy baryon @xmath0 .    the light quark contribution to the qcd lagrangian _",
    "q = |q(i d - m_q)q ,  ( q = u , d ,  s ) has an approximate su(3)@xmath17 @xmath18 su(3)@xmath19 flavor chiral symmetry , because the current quark masses are all very small on the typical hadron energy scale .",
    "it was known early on that this symmetry must be spontaneously broken by the qcd vacuum , so that the physical spectra of hadrons made up of light quarks have only su(3)@xmath20 symmetry . moreover , due to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , there exist eight pseudoscalar bosons ( called goldstone bosons , which include three @xmath21 s , four @xmath22 s , and one @xmath23 ) .",
    "their couplings to hadrons at low energies are determined by partial conservation of axial - vector current ( pcac ) and current algebra .",
    "the chiral properties of a heavy hadron is dictated by its light quark contents .",
    "for the heavy baryon , a heavy quark @xmath24 will combine the two light quarks to form baryons @xmath25 .",
    "however , the two light quarks can form a symmetric sextet or an antisymmetric antitriplet in flavor su(3 ) space .",
    "for the ground state baryons , the su(3 ) symmetric sextet diquarks have spin 1 whereas the su(3 ) antisymmetric antitriplet diquarks have spin 0 . thus for the su(3 ) symmetric sextet there are both spin @xmath26 baryons ( @xmath27 ) and spin @xmath28 baryons ( @xmath29 ) . for the su(3 ) antisymmetric antitriplet there is only spin @xmath26 baryons ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "once the flavor su(3 ) contents of these heavy baryons are determined , their couplings to goldstone bosons can be immediately written down following the standard formalism of chiral dynamics .",
    "the mit bag model @xcite is a simple relativistic model of hadrons which is consistent with some of the essential features of qcd , namely confinement , gluon degree of freedom , and gauge invariance .",
    "it has been applied to describe hadron spectroscopy @xcite and various transitions where momentum transfers are not large @xcite .",
    "the greatest success of the mit bag model lies in its description of ground state hadrons formed with light quarks , where agreement with the experimental data is remarkable .",
