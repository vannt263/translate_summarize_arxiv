    "according to the standard model of cosmology , supported by a large amount of observational data , during its evolution the universe has experienced two phases of accelerated expansion , the inflationary one at early times and the current one at late times @xcite . in order to explain these accelerated phases one should introduce small deviations to the standard physics paradigm , and there are two main directions that one can follow .",
    "the first is to maintain general relativity as the gravitational theory and alter the content of the universe by introducing novel , exotic forms of matter fields , either as inflaton field(s ) @xcite or as dark energy sector @xcite .",
    "the second way is to modify the gravitational sector , constructing a theory that possesses general relativity as a particular limit , but with additional degrees of freedom that can drive an accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "although most of the works in modified gravity start from the usual gravitational description based on curvature and modify the einstein - hilbert action , with the simplest example being the @xmath1 scenario @xcite , one could equally well construct gravitational modifications starting from the torsion - based description of gravity .",
    "in particular , one could start from the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite , in which the gravitational lagrangian is the torsion scalar @xmath2 , and build various extensions , with the simplest example being the @xmath0 theory @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly enough , although tegr is completely equivalent with general relativity at the level of equations , @xmath0 does not coincide with @xmath1 gravity , and thus its cosmological application has led to novel features , either at inflationary stage @xcite or at the late - time accelerated epoch @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , unimodular gravity @xcite is an interesting gravitational theory , which can be considered as a specific case of general relativity . in particular , while in standard general relativity the origin of the cosmological constant is not well understood @xcite , in unimodular gravity it arises as the trace - free part of the gravitational field equations , as long as the determinant of the metric is fixed to a number or a function .",
    "the great theoretical advantage of this procedure is that since the trace - free part of the field equations is not related to the vacuum expectation value of any matter field , one can fix its value without facing the cosmological constant problem .",
    "hence , one can use unimodular gravity in order to describe the inflationary regime @xcite and the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "additionally , one can start from unimodular gravity in order to construct extensions , such as unimodular @xmath1 gravity @xcite and unimodular @xmath0 gravity @xcite , which prove to have interesting cosmological implications .    in the present work we are interesting in investigating inflationary cosmology in the framework of unimodular @xmath0 gravity .",
    "specifically , we study the lagrange multiplier method to represent the action of unimodular @xmath0 gravity and we build its reconstruction procedure . in addition",
    ", we extract the observables of the inflationary regime , namely the spectral index of the curvature perturbations and its running , the tensor spectral index , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , showing that they are in very satisfactory agreement with observations .",
    "finally , we study the instability of the de sitter solution , by investigating its perturbations , showing that a graceful exit can always be realized for specific parametric regions , which is an advantage of inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity .    the plan of the work is the following . in sec .

    "furthermore , one uses the curvatureless weitzenbck connection @xcite @xmath6 , instead of the standard torsionless levi - civita one , and thus the gravitational field is described not by the curvature tensor but by the torsion one , which reads as @xmath7 the lagrangian of such a theory is just the torsion scalar @xmath2 , which is constructed by contractions of the torsion tensor , namely @xcite @xmath8 since in @xmath1 gravity one extends the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , namely the ricci scalar @xmath9 to an arbitrary function @xmath1 , one can follow a similar procedure in the context of teleparallel gravity , i.e. generalize @xmath2 to @xmath0 obtaining the @xmath0 gravitational modification @xcite : @xmath10 , \\label{actiontotft}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , with @xmath13 the planck mass .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath0 gravity arise by variation of the total action @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the matter action , in terms of the vierbeins , and they write as @xmath16 where the `` super - potential '' tensor @xmath17 is defined in terms of the co - torsion tensor @xmath18 .",

    "in the previous section we presented unimodular @xmath0 gravity and we analyzed the procedure with which one can reconstruct the specific @xmath0 form that can generate a given scale - factor evolution . hence , in the present section we will apply these in inflationary cosmology , in order to investigate inflation realization in unimodular @xmath0 gravity .",
    "additionally , we will extract various inflation - related observables , such as the scalar and tensor spectral indices , the running spectral index , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , and we will compare them with observational data .      in every inflationary scenario one needs to calculate the values of various inflation - related observables , such as the scalar spectral index of the curvature perturbations @xmath82 , the running @xmath83 of the spectral index @xmath82 , where @xmath84 is the absolute value of the wave number @xmath85 , the tensor spectral index @xmath86 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath87 , since these quantities are determined very accurately by observational data , and thus confrontation can constrain of exclude the scenarios at hand . in principle , the calculation of the above observables requires a detailed and lengthy perturbation analysis .",

    "should instead introduce the `` hubble slow - roll '' parameters @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 positive integer ) , defined as @xcite @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 the e - folding number , and where @xmath100 is the scale factor at the beginning of inflation and @xmath101 the corresponding hubble parameter ( inflation ends when @xmath102 ) . in terms of the first three @xmath95 , which are straightforwardly extracted to be @xmath103\\ ! , \\label{xivbb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the inflationary observables write as @xcite @xmath104 obviously , in cases where both the potential - related slow - roll parameters and the hubble slow - roll parameters can be defined , the final expressions for the observables @xmath87 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 coincide .    in the present work we are interested in investigating inflationary cosmology in the framework of unimodular @xmath0 gravity . similarly to usual @xmath0 gravity , and in contrast with @xmath1 gravity , in this case there is not a conformal transformation to the einstein frame @xcite , where one could find the effective scalar potential and then use it in order to calculate the potential - related slow - roll parameters .",
    "hence , in order to calculate the inflationary observables we must use the hubble slow - roll parameters ( [ epsvbb])-([xivbb ] ) , and then insert them into expressions ( [ eps111bb])-([eps444bb ] ) .",
    "let us first provide the kinematical expressions for inflation realization . without loss of generality we focus on two basic inflationary scale - factor evolutions , namely the de sitter and the power - law ones .",
    "the investigation of arbitrary evolutions is straightforward .",
    "for the de sitter inflation the scale factor has the well - known exponential form @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the constant hubble parameter at the inflationary stage . in this case , following the procedure of the previous section , and in particular relations ( [ dtdatu ] ) and ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) , we find @xmath110 similarly , for the power - law inflation the scale factor has the form ( [ apowergener ] ) , namely @xmath111 where @xmath56 is the value of @xmath57 at time @xmath58 and @xmath112 is a constant . in this case , and as was analyzed in the previous section , in expressions ( [ eq:2.1200 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.14 ] ) , we obtain @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 $ ] . note that in the limit @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 , the power - law expansion ( [ apowergener2 ] ) gives the de sitter expansion ( [ desittat ] ) , with @xmath119 .",
    "hence , we can study both cases in a simultaneous way , using ( [ eq:2.1200bb ] ) , and thus the unimodular metric ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) becomes @xmath120 .",
    "\\label{eq:2.11}\\ ] ] in summary , for @xmath121 we re - obtain the de sitter expansion , while for @xmath122 , i.e. for @xmath123 , the power - law inflation is realized .",

    "finally , for @xmath128 , i.e. for @xmath129 , accelerated expansion , and thus inflation , is not realized .",
    "let us now investigate the observables in the case of power - law inflation . as it was shown in @xcite , it is more convenient to use the e - folding number @xmath130 as the independent variable ( for related considerations , see  @xcite ) . hence , for every function @xmath22 we have that @xmath131 , where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath130 .",

    "however , one can see that the power - law inflation is a quite simple scenario and thus the expressions for the observables , although in agreement with observations , are simple and one does not have large parametric freedom to change their values .",

    "in this section we are interested in investigating the graceful exit from inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity . in general ,",
    "if the de sitter solution describing the inflationary stage is unstable , then the graceful exit from inflation can be realized .",
    "when the de sitter inflation occurs the hubble parameter is described by @xmath233 , where @xmath109 is a positive constant . in order to examine the instability of the de sitter solution",
    ", we consider the perturbations of the hubble parameter , which can be expressed as @xmath234 with @xmath235 a constant . in ( [ eq:4.1 ] )",
    "the term @xmath236 describes the perturbations from the de sitter solution , i.e. the constant part @xmath109 of the hubble parameter , and thus we assume @xmath237 .",
    "note that in this way we can quantify the instability of the de sitter solution .",
    "if we obtain a positive solution of @xmath235 then the value of @xmath238 increases in time during inflation , and thus the de sitter solution is unstable .",
    "consequently , the inflationary stage ends successfully and the universe can enter the reheating stage and its standard thermal history .",
    "let us focus on the specific scenario analyzed in subsection [ specificmodel ] .",

    "hence , we can always find parametric regions which correspond to @xmath245 , and thus to a graceful exit from the inflationary regime .",
    "we close this section by making some comments on the difference between the present scenario of inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity and @xmath143 inflation ( starobinsky inflation ) , focusing on the graceful exit . in particular , in @xmath143 inflation , for the flat flrw geometry , by differentiating an equation derived from the gravitational field equations in the absence of matter @xcite , in terms of @xmath29 , one finds @xmath248 where @xmath249 . inserting ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) , with @xmath250 , into eq .",

    "( [ eq:4.9 ] ) that even if there exists a real solution for @xmath252 , it would be a non - positive solution , which implies that through the perturbative analysis the instability of the de sitter solution does not appear . in summary , the de sitter solution for @xmath143 inflation would be more stable than that for inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this difference between @xmath143 inflation and inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity acts as an advantage for the latter .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated the inflationary realization in the context of unimodular @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the action of the theory is based on the @xmath0 modification of teleparallel gravity , in which one imposes the unimodular condition through the use of lagrange multipliers .",
    "hence , we have developed the general reconstruction procedure of the @xmath0 form that can give rise to a given scale - factor evolution .",
    "having presented the general machinery , we have applied it in the inflationary regime . in particular , we have extracted the hubble slow - roll parameters that allow us to calculate various inflation - related observables , such as the scalar spectral index and its running , the tensor - to - scalar ratio , and the tensor spectral index .",
    "then , we examined the particular cases of de sitter and power - law inflation , of starobinsky inflation , as well as inflation in a specific model of unimodular @xmath0 gravity .",
    "as we showed , in all cases the predictions of our scenarios are in a very good agreement with observational data from planck probe .",
    "apart from the very satisfactory agreement with observations , the scenario of inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity has the additional advantage that it always allows for a graceful exit for specific regions of the model parameters , as it can be seen by examining the instability of the de sitter phase .",
    "this is in contrast with inflationary realizations in curvature - based modified gravity , such as the starobinsky inflation , where a graceful exit is not guaranteed .",
    "the above features make inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity a successful candidate for the description of the early universe .",

    "<S> we investigate the inflationary realization in the context of unimodular @xmath0 gravity , which is based on the @xmath0 modification of teleparallel gravity , in which one imposes the unimodular condition through the use of lagrange multipliers . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the general reconstruction procedure of the @xmath0 form that can give rise to a given scale - factor evolution , and then we apply it in the inflationary regime . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the hubble slow - roll parameters that allow us to calculate various inflation - related observables , such as the scalar spectral index and its running , the tensor - to - scalar ratio , and the tensor spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> then , we examine the particular cases of de sitter and power - law inflation , of starobinsky inflation , as well as inflation in a specific model of unimodular @xmath0 gravity . </S>",
    "<S> as we show , in all cases the predictions of our scenarios are in a very good agreement with planck observational data . finally , inflation in unimodular @xmath0 gravity </S>",
    "<S> has the additional advantage that it always allows for a graceful exit for specific regions of the model parameters . </S>"
