    "markov partitions are a powerful tool in the study of hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of manifolds .",
    "explicit constructions of markov partitions for hyperbolic toral automorphisms of the  @xmath1-torus  @xmath2 in the work of adler and weiss  @xcite are an important paradigmatic example , and in special situations the tight connection between the geometry of the map and the partition found in  @xcite is extended to automorphisms of  @xmath3 with  @xmath4 by manning  @xcite . on the other hand , maps of objects that are not quite manifolds arise naturally in dynamics , notably as attractors of smooth maps in work of bowen  @xcite and williams  @xcite .",
    "thus a natural extension of the classical theory of smooth maps of compact manifolds concerns maps of solenoids ; a useful overview and the history may be found in a paper of takens  @xcite .",
    "the simplest solenoids are algebraic : compact groups that are locally isometric to products of local fields .    the structure of a tangent space comprising a product of local fields including non - archimedean ones may be used to study various dynamical properties of automorphisms of solenoids : exotic orbit - growth properties by chothi , everest , miles , stevens and the first author  @xcite ,  @xcite ; entropy and structure of  @xmath5-actions of entropy rank one by einsiedler and lind  @xcite ; topological entropy by lind and the first author  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to study geometrically natural markov partitions like those used by abramov  @xcite and wilson  @xcite for one of the simplest examples in which non - archimedean directions arise in the tangent space , and to study how the structure of those partitions changes in expansive cones .",
    "this gives a simple geometrical instance of the ` subdynamics philosophy ' of boyle and lind  @xcite .",
    "a combinatorial instance of the same kind of structure appears in work of miles and the first author  @xcite , where it is shown that directional zeta functions detect the non - expansive set for systems of entropy rank one .    in order to do this ,",
    "we describe the structure of the space obtained by taking the invertible extension of the  @xmath6-action generated by  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 on the additive circle in a geometric way . to simplify matters we concentrate on this one example : the same kind of construction works in those systems of entropy rank one with an adelic covering space , but is significantly more involved . in principle the markov and generating properties of the partitions can be shown from our geometric description , but for brevity we deduce some of these properties from wilson s results .",

    "the isomorphism is then defined by sending  @xmath88 to the point  @xmath89 .",
    "this isomorphism respects the metric structures ( nearby points in  @xmath32 correspond to nearby points in the projective limit ) and is equivariant with respect to the automorphisms we study .",
    "the automorphisms  @xmath90 and  @xmath91 on  @xmath38 preserve  @xmath37 and therefore define automorphisms of  @xmath73 .    to see how the group  @xmath32 works ,",

    "there are three non - expansive lines  @xmath109 ( containing maps like  @xmath12 , which behaves like an isometry on the  @xmath1-adic direction ) ,  @xmath110 ( containing maps like  @xmath11 , which behaves like an isometry on the  @xmath92-adic direction ) and  @xmath111 ( which does not contain any lattice points , but has a sequence of lattice points  @xmath112 converging to it with the property that the real lyapunov exponent  @xmath113 of the map  @xmath114 converges to zero as  @xmath115 ) .",
    "it is clear that there can not be a single finite partition that is generating for all the maps  @xmath104 as  @xmath116 varies inside an expansive cone because the set of topological entropies of the maps in a cone is unbounded .",
    "thus , what we mean by `` stable '' is that the markov partition for  @xmath104 is constructed in a uniform manner across all  @xmath117 .",
    "we will see later that the geometry of how the map acts on an atom of the partition is uniform across each expansive cone but changes at each non - expansive direction .",

    "much of the proof of theorem  [ theorem : stablemarkovpartitions ] will use results from wilson  @xcite that conceal the geometry of the actions . in order to see how the maps act geometrically",

    "the expansive region  @xmath143 is particularly simple because the system  @xmath144 is ( at each point with  @xmath145 ) simply the invertible extension of the map  @xmath146 on the circle , and  @xmath123 is the usual partition into intervals of width  @xmath147 on  @xmath87 lifted to  @xmath32 .",

    "this ( and other steps flagged below ) may in principle be extracted from wilson s paper  @xcite but we prove it here to show how the map works .",

    "we need some notation for the sets arising as the map is iterated .",
    "the first iteration is straightforward , and we can write @xmath173 for  @xmath174 the next iteration is more complicated , because the image involves reduction modulo  @xmath37 .",

    "moreover , @xmath257 as  @xmath258 , so  @xmath256 is a generating markov partition in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "away from the positive and negative quadrants  @xmath143 the behaviour of  @xmath165 under the map  @xmath164 is more complicated . in particular , as seen in figure  [ fig : multby3over2a ] , an atom in  @xmath259 need not be a rectangle even in expansive directions .",

    "* exercise  6.1 ) ) ; he also shows that an atom in  @xmath264 lies inside a cylinder defined by small intervals in many coordinates in the description  , so @xmath265 it follows that  @xmath256 is a generating markov partition for  @xmath104 .",
    "there are three non - expansive directions , but only two of them contain non - trivial lattice points : example  [ example : one ] shows that  @xmath130 is not generating under  @xmath11 ; the other direction  @xmath266 is similar .",
