    "open development platforms like android and the facebook platform have resulted in the availability of hundreds of thousands of third - party applications that end users can install with only a few clicks . consequently , end users are faced with a large and potentially bewildering number of choices when looking for applications .",
    "users installation decisions have privacy and security ramifications : android applications can access device hardware and data , and facebook applications can access users profile information and social networks . as such , it is important to help users select applications that operate as the user intends .",
    "android and facebook use permission systems to control the privileges of applications .",
    "applications can only access privacy- and security - relevant resources if the user approves an appropriate permission request .",
    "for example , an android application can only send text messages if it has the ` send_sms ` permission ; during installation , the user will see a warning that the application can `` send sms messages '' if the installation is completed .",
    "these permission systems are intended to help users avoid privacy- or security - invasive applications .",
    "unfortunately , user research has demonstrated that many users do not pay attention to or understand the permission warnings  @xcite .",
    "a major problem here is that users do not know what permission combinations are typical for applications .",
    "our work is a first step in the direction of simplifying permission systems by means of statistical methods .",
    "we propose to identify common patterns in permission requests so that applications that do not fit the predominant patterns can be flagged for additional user scrutiny . towards this goal",
    ", we apply a probabilistic method for boolean matrix factorization to the permission requests of android and facebook applications .",
    "we find that while applications with good reputations ( i.e. , many ratings and a high average score ) typically correspond well to a set of permission request patterns , applications with poor reputations ( i.e. , less than 10 ratings ) often deviate from those patterns .",
    "the primary contribution of this paper is the first analysis of permission request patterns with a statistically sound model .",
    "our technique captures the concept of identifying `` unusual '' permission requests .",
    "our evaluation demonstrates that our technique is highly generalizable , meaning that the found clustering is stable over different random subsets of the data .",
    "we find that permission request patterns can indicate user satisfaction or application quality .",
    "android and the facebook platform support extensive third - party application markets .",
    "they use permission systems to limit applications access to users private information and resources .",
    "the android market is the official ( and primary ) store for android applications .",
    "the market provides users with average user ratings , user reviews , descriptions , screenshots , and permissions to help them select applications .",
    "android applications can access phone hardware ( e.g. , the microphone ) and private user information ( e.g. , call history ) via android s api .",
    "permissions restrict applications ability to use the api .",
    "for example , an application can only take a photograph if it has the ` camera ` permission .",
    "developers select the permissions that their applications need to function , and these permission requests are shown to users during the installation process .",
    "the user must approve all of an application s permissions in order to install the application .",
    "several studies have examined android applications use of permissions .",
    "barrera et al .",
    "surveyed the @xmath0 most popular applications and found that applications primarily request a small number of permissions , leaving most other permissions unused  @xcite .",
    "they used self - organizing maps ( a dimensionality reduction technique ) to visualize the relationship between application categories and permission requests ; based on this analysis , they concluded that categories and permissions are not strongly related .",
    "their focus was on visualization and their findings are not applicable to identifying unusual permission request patterns ; they relied on the minimization of a euclidian cost function to find a low dimensional visualization of the data , whereas we use a generative probabilistic model to learn request patterns . felt et al .  and chia et al .",
    "surveyed android applications and identified the most - requested permissions  @xcite .",
    "chia et al .  also found several correlations between the number of permissions and other factors : a weak positive correlation with the number of installs , a weak positive correlation with the average rating , a positive correlation with the availability of a developer website , and a negative correlation with the number of applications published by the same developer .",
    "we expand on these past analyses , and our analysis of permission requests is by far the largest study to date .",
    "other research has focused on using machine learning techniques to identify malware .",
    "sanz et al .",
    "applied several types of classifiers to the permissions , ratings , and static strings of @xmath1 applications to see if they could predict application categories , using the category scenario as a stand - in for malware detection  @xcite .",
    "shabtai et al .  similarly built a classifier for android games and tools , as a proxy for malware detection  @xcite .",
    "zhou et al .  found real malware in the wild with droidranger , a malware detection system that uses permissions as one input  @xcite .",
    "although our techniques are similar , our goal is to understand the difference between high - reputation and low - reputation applications rather than to identify malware .",
    "applications may be of low quality or act in undesirable ways ( i.e. , be risky ) without being malware .",
    "additionally , our approach only relies on permission requests ; unlike these past approaches , we do not statically analyze applications to extract features , which makes our technique applicable to platforms where code is not available ( such as the facebook platform ) .",
    "enck et al .  built a tool that warns users about applications that request blacklisted sets of permissions  @xcite .",
    "they manually selected the blacklisted patterns to represent dangerous sets of permissions .",
    "in contrast , we advocate a statistical whitelisting approach : we propose to warn users about applications that do not match the permission request patterns expressed by high - reputation applications .",
    "these two approaches could be complementary ; human review of the statistically - generated patterns could potentially improve them .",
    "the facebook platform supports third - party integration with facebook .",
    "facebook lists applications in an `` apps and games '' market alongside information about the applications , including the numbers of installs , the average ratings , and the names of friends who use the same applications . through the facebook platform",
    ", applications can read users profile information , post to users news feeds , read and send messages , control users advertising preferences , etc .",
    "access to these resources is limited by a permission system , and developers must request the appropriate permissions for their applications to function .",
    "applications can request permissions at any time , but most permission requests are displayed during installation as a condition of installation .",
    "chia et al . surveyed facebook applications and found that their permission usage is similar to android applications : a small number of permissions are heavily used , and popular applications request more permissions  @xcite .",
    "we collected information about 188,389 android applications from the official android market in november 2011 .",
    "this data set encompasses approximately @xmath2 of the android market , which contained 319,161 active applications as of october 2011  @xcite . to build our data set , we crawled and screen - scraped the web version of the android market .",
    "each application has its own description page on the market website , but the market does not provide an index of all of its applications . to find applications description pages , we first crawled the lists of `` top free '' and `` top paid '' applications .",
    "these lists yielded links to 32,106 unique application pages .",
    "next , we fed 1,000 randomly - selected dictionary words and all possible two - letter permutations ( e.g. , `` ac '' ) into the market s search engine .",
    "the search result listings provided us with links to an additional @xmath3 unique applications .",
    "once we located applications description pages , we parsed their html to extract applications names , categories , average rating score , numbers of ratings , numbers of downloads , prices , and permissions .",
    "chia et al . provided us with a set of 27,029 facebook applications  @xcite .",
    "they collected these applications by crawling socialbakers  @xcite , a site that aggregates statistics about facebook applications .",
    "after following socialbakers s links to applications , they screen - scraped any permission prompts that appeared .",
    "they also collected the average ratings and number of ratings for each application .",
    "one limitation of this data set is that it only includes the permission requests that are shown to users as a condition of installation ; they did not attempt to explore the functionality of the applications to collect secondary permission requests that might occur later . as such , our analysis only incorporates the permission requests that are shown to users as part of the installation flow .      as an overview , we provide global statistics of the application datasets .",
    "we investigate overall application features , such as the price , ratings , and most popular permissions .",
    "the characteristics of these features play a role in our analysis of permission request patterns ( section  [ sec_exps ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab_globalperms ] lists the 15 most frequently requested android permissions , and table  [ tab_fb ] depicts the 15 most frequently requested facebook permissions .",
    "as these indicate , a small number of permissions are widely requested , but most permissions are infrequently requested ."
