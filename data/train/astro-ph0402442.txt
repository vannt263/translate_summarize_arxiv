    "as a step on the road toward the ultimate goal of detecting primordial gravitational waves , upcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization experiments will target the distortion to the acoustic polarization induced by gravitational lensing . as with the polarization induced by gravitational waves ,",
    "the gravitationally lensed polarization contains a component with handedness , the so - called @xmath0 mode component @xcite . unlike gravitational waves",
    ", gravitational lensing provides a guaranteed signal . in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "the predicted amplitude of the @xmath0 modes can only vary at the tens of percent level within current constraints @xcite .",
    "moreover these fine variations provide an opportunity to measure the dark side of the universe , namely the dark energy and neutrino dependent growth of structure , as well as another handle on the reionization optical depth @xcite .",
    "although both the intrinsic distribution and the density perturbations that lens the cmb are expected to be gaussian , the lensed distribution is non - gaussian at second order in the perturbations .",
    "the non - gaussianity is therefore relatively small in the temperature distribution @xcite .",
    "however because the @xmath0 modes are generated by the lensing itself , its non - gaussianity is a first order effect but fortunately one that is precisely calculable .",
    "gravitational lensing therefore also provides a unique testing ground for experimentally extracting a non - gaussian signal in the presence of foregrounds and systematic errors .",
    "ultimately , the non - gaussianity of the lensed polarization also provides the key to mapping the dark matter @xcite and hence the separation of the lensing and gravitational wave @xmath0 mode components @xcite .    for the upcoming generation of experiments",
    ", the non - gaussianity will provide an important source of uncertainty for power spectrum measurements .",
    "fisher information studies have shown that the information contained on cosmological parameters in the @xmath0 mode power spectrum under the gaussian approximation unphysically exceeds that contained in the two underlying gaussian fields @xcite .    in this paper , we study the origin and quantify the impact of the non - gaussian sample variance on @xmath0 mode power spectra measurements .",
    "the basic reason for the large sample variance is that the fluctuations that lens the cmb are mainly on degree scales .",
    "all of the arcminute scale @xmath0 modes fluctuate jointly with the lens and so precision measurements will require many degree scale patches not simply many arcminute scale patches .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : bmodes ] by briefly reviewing the generation of @xmath0 modes through gravitational lensing .",
    "we calculate the non - gaussian sample covariance in  [ sec : covariance ] and explore its impact on measurements in  [ sec : impact ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : discussion ] . for illustrative purposes we employ throughout a fiducial cosmology",
    "that is consistent with wmap determinations : an initial scale invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations with amplitude @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , a baryon density @xmath7 and a matter density @xmath8 in a flat @xmath9 cosmology .",

    "we illustrate this effect with monte carlo realizations of the polarization field and lenses from the power spectra of the fiducial cosmology .",

    "the non - gaussian covariance manifests itself here as a positive correlation from bin to bin , and a higher variance than one would expect from gaussian statistics alone .",

    "the sample covariance of band powers provides the ultimate limitations for measuring the @xmath0 mode power .",

    "mode leakage will require experiment - specific monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the @xmath0 modes in the lensed cmb polarization substantially degrades the amount of information contained in the @xmath0 mode power spectrum .",

    "as experiments move from the upper limit and first detection stage to using the @xmath0 mode power spectrum to constrain the properties of dark components such as the neutrinos and dark energy , this non - gaussianity will have to be included in the analysis . by quantifying the sample covariance , we have provided the analytic and numerical tools that will be the basis for such an analysis .",
    "the advantage of the monte carlo approach is that it can be straightforwardly applied to any estimator of @xmath0 power .    in principle",
    ", one can include the sample covariance in an effective @xmath98 as is done for power spectrum errors of the temperature field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however since the computation of the covariance is much more costly than the computation of the @xmath0 power spectrum , minimization in a large - dimensional cosmological parameter space is impractical even with monte carlo markov chain techniques . since most of the parameters affecting the high redshift universe will be fixed prior to these measurements from the @xmath99 and @xmath19 mode spectra , as a first order correction one can follow the fisher matrix approach and calculate the effect in a fiducial model .",
    "more specifically , given the correlation matrix ( @xmath72 ) and the relative variance degradation ( @xmath100 ) in a fiducial model , one can scale the covariance matrix to the model @xmath0 mode spectrum ( @xmath101 ) as calculated from boltzmann codes .",
    "this approach would capture the main scaling of the covariance through the amplitude of the lensing power spectrum .",
    "implementing such a pipeline though is beyond the scope of this paper .",
