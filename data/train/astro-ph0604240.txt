    "dust plays a major role in the dynamics of star formation .",
    "the determination of its properties and distribution is hence a major challenge towards a better understanding .",
    "there are two widely used methods ( star counts and colour excess ) to determine the distribution and column density of dust in the interstellar medium .    the original idea of using star counts to measure dust extinction dates back to wolf @xcite .",
    "later bok @xcite improved the accuracy by implementing star counts at the completeness limit of the images .",
    "the difference between the measured and intrinsic colour of a star ( colour excess ) was used by lada et al .",
    "@xcite to determine the extinction .",
    "this approach was optimised by lombardi & alves from multi - band photometry .",
    "recently lombardi investigated how the two methods can be optimally combined .",
    "star counts gauge extinction at a given wavelength .",
    "the colour excess requires the knowledge of the reddening law to obtain an extinction measurement .",
    "further the reddening law is required to transform these values into the widely used optical extinction ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this transformation law is not known _",
    "a priori_. there is reasoning that a universal extinction law is valid for the diffuse interstellar medium ( draine ) . in translucent and dense regions ,",
    "however , processes like coagulation of dust grains and mantle growth can lead to a change in the dust properties ( whittet et al .",
    "@xcite ; cambrsy et al . ;",
    "del burgo et al .",
    "@xcite ; del burgo & laureijs @xcite ) , which could result in a different extinction law ( larson & whittet @xcite ) .",
    "ultraviolet and cosmic ray radiation has also some influence in the density and properties of dust grains ( e.g. del burgo & cambrsy @xcite ) .",
    "froebrich et al .",
    "showed that the near infrared extinction powerlaw index ( @xmath0 ) within dark clouds can vary significantly from the value obtained for the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is the following .",
    "we describe an easy - to - use and fast method to determine @xmath0 from multi - filter broad - band observations ( sect.[theory ] ) .",
    "this method is applied in sect.[ic1396w ] to an example cloud ( ic1396w ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of using the determined @xmath0 instead of the standard value of 1.85 ( draine ) , for density profile analyses of dark clouds . in sect.[exttest ] we present a technique to test the accuracy of extinction determination methods by artificial photometric catalogues based on the model of stellar population synthesis of the galaxy by robin et al . .",
    "we finally discuss systematic uncertainties introduced into extinction maps when using colour excess methods ( sect.[distcorr ] ) .",
    "our conclusions are then put forward in sect.[conclusions ] .",
    "there are several possible methods to determine the near infrared extinction power law index ( @xmath0 ) . in this section",
    "we describe techniques based on star counts , colour excess and a combination of both .",
    "the description is done in a general way , in order to adapt the procedure to different datasets .",
    "we discuss in detail the uncertainties of each method .      each method discussed below",
    "will determine @xmath0 as a function of two variables @xmath2 .",
    "those can be extinction and/or colour excess .",
    "hence we can write @xmath3 . each variable consists of @xmath4 different values ( pixels in the extinction and/or",
    "colour excess maps ) .",
    "following taylor , we describe the difference of the individually measured @xmath0 values from the mean value as :    @xmath5    a possible estimator of the variance of @xmath0 , defined as @xmath6 can thus be expressed by the following equation : @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to the estimators of the variance of the variables @xmath2 .",
    "they can be estimated as the square of the noise in the input extinction and/or colour excess maps .",
    "the estimator of the covariance of the two input variables @xmath10 can be determined from the extinction and/or colour excess maps as follows : multiply both images and determine the mean pixel value of the product image in an extinction free region .",
    "note that in an extinction free field the mean values @xmath11 and @xmath12 are zero .    in the next three subsections we introduce three different methods to determine the function @xmath3 and the resulting estimator of the variance ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "extinction mapping using accumulative star counts allows us to determine the extinction at wavelength @xmath14 where the photometry is obtained ( e.g. wolf @xcite ; cambrsy et al .",
    "@xcite ; froebrich et al . ) .",
    "it is assumed that extinction has been measured with two different filterbands at reference wavelengths ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "also we assume the extinction has a power - law dependence @xmath16 in the wavelength range of interest .",
    "then , the unknown index @xmath0 can be determined from :    @xmath17    to estimate the uncertainty of @xmath0 we introduce two parameters : 1 ) @xmath18 , which corresponds to the ratio of the estimators of the variance in the two star count maps , i.e. @xmath19 2 ) @xmath20 , which corresponds to the ratio of the estimator of the variance in the star count map at @xmath21 and the estimator of the covariance of the two star count maps , i.e. @xmath22 . the estimator of the variance of @xmath0 can then be expressed as :    @xmath23 \\label{deltabeta1}\\ ] ]    figure[err_bet ] ( top - left ) shows , as an example , the relative uncertainty @xmath24 versus @xmath0 for typical star counts in j- and h - band 2mass data .",
    "the three different lines in fig.[err_bet ] ( top - left ) denote extinction measurements @xmath25 of 4 , 6 and 10@xmath26 . for 2mass data in the area of ic1396w",
    "we have determined @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see below ) .",
    "it is found that a high accuracy for the extinction measurements is required to obtain a good signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) for @xmath0 ; for typical values of @xmath29 at least a @xmath30 detection of the extinction in the j - band is needed to determine @xmath0 with an accuracy of 40% .",
    "note that this is valid for a single measurement only ( 1 independent pixel in the extinction map ) .",
    "the s / n can be improved by averaging over several independent measurements ( see below ) .",
    "+      the most simple approach of a colour excess method is to measure the apparent brightness of a star at two different wavelengths , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and compare the colour @xmath31 - @xmath32 with the theoretical value for main sequence stars or the colour of stars measured in an extinction free control field @xmath33 - @xmath34 ( e.g. lada et al .",
    "the colour excess @xmath35 is defined as :    @xmath36    if we assume that this colour excess is entirely due to extinction and , as for the star count analysis , a constant @xmath0 is valid , we can determine the extinction at @xmath37 by    @xmath38    measuring @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , we as well can determine the extinction at @xmath37 :    @xmath41    the right hand side of both equations should essentially give the same value .",
    "we can define the colour excess ratio @xmath42 and obtain the following equation for @xmath0 :    @xmath43    fig.[bet_r ] shows the solution of eq.[betacolour ] for some filter combinations .",
    "these plots allow us to estimate @xmath0 for a certain filterband combination and measured colour excess ratio .    since @xmath0 can not be determined analytically from eq.[betacolour ] , we assume that @xmath44 provides a solution of eq.[betacolour ] with sufficient accuracy ( the function @xmath45 could be a polynomial of order @xmath46 )",
    ". then we can determine the estimator of the variance of @xmath0 using :    @xmath47 \\left ( \\frac{\\partial { \\bf b}(r)}{\\partial r } \\right)^2   \\label{deltabetacol1}\\ ] ]    note that the partial derivative @xmath48 can directly be obtained from eq.[betacolour ] by using the inverse function theorem .",
    "we define the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "average values based on 2mass data for ic1396w are @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that these values depend on the intrinsic scatter of the stellar colours , the spacial distribution of stars and the photometric uncertainties in the data , and are hence subject to change slightly with position . in fig.[err_bet ] ( top - right ) the resulting relative uncertainty of @xmath0 for this example is plotted .",
    "similar to the star counting technique , high s / n colour excess maps are required to reliably estimate @xmath0 .",
    "we note , however , that for the same dataset usually a higher s / n is achieved for the colour excess method than for the star counting ( see e.g. cambrsy et al @xcite ) .      if observations at only two wavelengths @xmath15 are available , we do not necessarily need to determine @xmath0 solely from star counts .",
    "we can combine star counts and colour excess .",
    "if we measure the extinction @xmath53 by star counts , the colour excess @xmath54 , and assume that @xmath0 is constant in the wavelength range of interest , then @xmath0 can be determined as :    @xmath55    as for the other two methods , we can estimate the uncertainty associated to the procedure .",
    "similar to those we define the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and obtain the estimator of the variance of @xmath0 :    @xmath58 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{\\rm cosc } } - \\frac{2}{\\gamma_{\\rm cosc } } \\left [ 1 - \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1 } \\right)^{-\\beta } \\right ] \\right\\ } \\label{eq11 } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    figure[err_bet ] ( bottom ) shows two examples of the relative uncertainty of @xmath0 when determined from the combination of star counts and colour excess .",
    "both cases combine j - band star counts and @xmath59 colour excess . in fig.[err_bet ] ( bottom left ) j - band star counts are used as a measure of the s / n . in fig.[err_bet ] ( bottom right ) the @xmath59 colour excess is used .",
    "values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained for the example ( ic1396w ) .      if observations at three wavelengths are available and we assume that there is a constant @xmath0 , in principle a variety of other possible combinations of colour excess and star counts emerges .",
    "one can combine colour excess between two of the wavelengths with star counts at a third wavelength .",
    "also two other combinations using purely colour excess are possible .",
    "since the procedure for the determination of @xmath0 and its uncertainty , as well as the results are very similar to the techniques described in the above paragraphs , we refrain from presenting them here .      the analysis so far is implicitly carried out using the simplifying assumption that extinction and colour excess measurements are carried out at monochromatic wavelengths .",
    "usually the observations are , however , obtained using broadband filters .",
    "does this influence our results ?",
    "firstly we note that extinction and colour excess measurements are obtained by averaging data over a number stars in a certain area .",
    "for example the colour excess maps of ic1396w ( presented below ) are determined using on average 25 stars at each position .",
    "the average spectral energy distribution of these stars indeed will change the reference wavelength of the used filter . for nir observations , as used here , the reference wavelength will be shorter as the reference wavelength of the used filter .",
    "second we note that all determination procedures for @xmath0 and its uncertainty depend on the ratio of two wavelength .",
    "a change of this ratio would imply systematic off - sets in our determined @xmath0-value .",
    "since for all nir filters the shift in reference wavelength is toward shorter wavelength , the resulting change in the wavelength ratio will be small .    to estimate this",
    "we have convolved black body curves with temperatures between 2000k and 12000k with 2mass filter profiles .",
    "it is found that the resulting shift in the reference wavelength ratio is at most 0.5% .",
    "this generally results in about 3% systematic off - sets for the value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is hence much smaller than the determined statistical noise , which is in the order of 30% or higher .",
    "thus , the use of broad band filters does not influence our results .",
    "in general all methods described here have similar uncertainties when applied to the same wavelength range .",
    "but it is possible to determine the method leading to the highest s / n in @xmath0 for any particular dataset .",
    "however , there might be additional systematic uncertainties ( see sect.[distcorr ] for a discussion ) .",
    "figure[err_bet ] allows us to compare the different methods . in the left panels",
    "the relative uncertainties of @xmath0 are plotted as a function of the s / n in the j - band star count map .",
    "note that for purely star counting the uncertainties are larger as for the combination of star counts and colour excess . in the right panels of fig.[err_bet ]",
    "the relative uncertainties of @xmath0 as a function of the s / n in the @xmath59 colour excess map are plotted .",
    "we find that the scatter is smaller when combining colour excess and star counts instead of using the colour excess ratio .",
    "this is especially the case towards smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that for our example ( ic1396w ) the combination of j - band star counts and @xmath59 colour excess provides the best @xmath0-map .",
    "note that this might change for other datasets , since the estimator of the variance of @xmath0 depends on the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "even when using the best method to determine @xmath0 , the uncertainties based on individual measurements ( one independent pixel in the extinction / colour excess maps ) are rather large even for high s / n extinction data .",
    "however , several pixels may be averaged to decrease the uncertainties .",
    "although a simple averaging over adjoining pixels would decrease the spatial resolution it is in general a good approach in regions were no apparent changes of @xmath0 are seen in the data ( i.e. the scatter of @xmath0-values is consistent with the statistical expectations ; 68% of the data points are within the 1@xmath26 error bars , etc . ) . if a dependency of @xmath0 on the column density is found ( as for ic1396w , see below ) , we suggest to apply the following method to determine how @xmath0 depends on the column density within individual clouds .",
    "+   +    * * accumulated star counts or its combination with colour excess : * for each independent pixel @xmath0 is plotted against extinction ( e.g. @xmath53 ) . a running mean in this diagram",
    "can then be used as representation of the relation @xmath0-@xmath53 .",
    "alternatively mean values of @xmath0 in certain @xmath53-bins can be fit by an appropriate function to establish the relation @xmath0-@xmath53 . * * colour excess : * the determination of the extinction from colour excess requires the knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , as a first step for each independent pixel the value of @xmath0 is plotted against the colour excess ( e.g. @xmath64 ) .",
    "similar to the accumulated star count method we establish the relation @xmath0-@xmath65 using a running mean or by fitting an appropriate function .",
    "this relation then can be used to determine the extinction from the colour excess and to determine e.g. the relation @xmath0-@xmath53 .",
    "in order to illustrate the @xmath0-determination procedure and its implications on extinction and cloud column density profiles , we present in this section an example , the small cloud ic1396w .",
    "this object is part of the cepob2 association , about 8 in size and at roughly 750pc distance ( e.g. froebrich & scholz ) .",
    "the position of the cloud in the sky and the 2mass detection limits facilitate our analysis in the way that there is only a negligible fraction of foreground stars to the cloud .",
    "hence we do not need to remove foreground stars when determining extinction maps .      in the top panel of fig.[ic1396w_extmaps ]",
    "we show the three extinction maps ( @xmath25 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) for this cloud obtained from accumulative star counts .",
    "the contours start at 0.15mag extinction at the filter wavelength and increase by this amount .",
    "the basic structure ( central peak and small extension to the east ) of the cloud is the same in all three filters .",
    "the extinction maps obtained from the colour excess maps show a slightly different structure ( see bottom panel of fig.[ic1396w_extmaps ] ) .",
    "in particular we can trace much better the outer areas of the cloud .",
    "there is an apparent small offset between the star count and colour excess extinction maps .",
    "this can be explained by possible differences in the selection of the control field ( for the colour excess an apparently iras emission free field south of the cloud was chosen , in contrast to the surrounding 1@xmath68x1@xmath68 field for the star counts ) .",
    "+          in the top panel of fig.[ic1396w_beta ] we show the @xmath0-maps of the cloud , as determined from the star counts in jh , hk and jk and using eq.[eq1 ] .",
    "the bottom left panel of fig.[ic1396w_beta ] displays the @xmath0-map obtained from the @xmath59 and @xmath69 colour excess maps and eq.[betacolour ] .",
    "the two remaining maps are determined using the combination of star counts , colour excess and eq.[eq10 ] . in the bottom middle panel",
    "we combine j - band star counts with @xmath59 colour excess , and in the bottom right panel h - band star counts and @xmath69 colour excess . in all cases only pixels are shown , where the used extinction or colour excess is 3@xmath26 above the noise .",
    "the first thing to note is that @xmath0-maps obtained using colour excess cover a larger area , indicating the superiority of the colour excess method to the star count method in the nir , in terms of s / n in the extinction maps .",
    "we also see a structure in the @xmath0-map that agrees well with the structure in the extinction maps .",
    "this suggests a dependence of @xmath0 on the column density in this cloud . in the outer regions of the cloud values for @xmath0 close to the canonical value for the interstellar medium of 1.85 ( draine )",
    "are found . in the centre of the cloud , where extinction is higher",
    ", @xmath0 drops to significantly smaller values , partly even below 1.0 . when using solely star counts to determine @xmath0 a smaller area is above the @xmath70 noise level and no structural information can be obtained .",
    "however , the combination of j - band star counts and @xmath71 colour excess agrees very well with the @xmath0-map obtained solely from colour excess .",
    "the small offset in the absolute @xmath0-values is due the different control fields used ( see discussion above ) .",
    "we note , however , that differences in @xmath0 within a single cloud can be easily determined by our method .",
    "the correct absolute value for @xmath0 requires a carefully chosen comparison field , which is free of extinction .      how does the change of @xmath0 influence column density profiles of the cloud ?",
    "we plot in fig.[ic1396w_profile ] the column density profile ( normalised to the peak ) from east to west across the cloud at a declination of 57.93@xmath68 .",
    "the solid line shows the profile from j - band star counts and the dotted line from @xmath59 colour excess ( converted with a constant @xmath0-value ) .",
    "there is a significant difference between the two profiles .",
    "the small peak in the east shows a much higher column density relative to the main peak when using colour excess instead of star counts .",
    "note that this difference is unchanged when varying @xmath0 , as long as a constant value is used for the whole cloud .",
    "we used our @xmath0-map obtained from the combination of j - band star counts and @xmath59 colour excess to convert the @xmath59-map into column density .",
    "the resulting profile is shown in fig.[ic1396w_profile ] as dot - dashed line .",
    "it is obvious that this dramatically changes the column density profile which now much more closely matches the profile obtained solely from star counts .",
    "note that we obtain the same result when using the @xmath0-map obtained from colour excess only ( dashed line ) .",
    "this example shows that the column density structure of clouds can differ significantly depending on the method used to determine the extinction maps .",
    "this in particularly holds when changes of @xmath0 are found within the cloud .",
    "thus , extinction maps from accumulative star counts or colour excess ( using the correct @xmath0 values ) should be favoured when investigating the structures / profiles of the denser parts of clouds , where changes of @xmath0 are more frequently observed .",
    "when investigating the outer areas of clouds , where @xmath0 is very close to the ism value , or at least constant , colour excess extinction maps provide the better solution due to their higher signal to noise .",
    "given the possible large uncertainties in the determination of @xmath0 , it is worthy to know the uncertainties of the underlying extinction maps from star counts or colour excess determination procedures . in particular any systematic effect",
    "should be investigated and corrected for . here",
    "we introduce a scheme to test the reliability of the extinction determination methods . a detailed discussion about the influence of the box size to the measured extinction , systematic offsets in colour excess methods and limitations for reliable foreground star detection is given .",
    "we used the model of stellar population synthesis of the galaxy by robin et al . to generate artificial data .",
    "this model allows us to generate artificial photometric catalogues for a given region in the sky .",
    "constraints for the limiting magnitude in each filterband can be applied .",
    "we performed all our simulations using 2mass catalogue magnitude limits ( j@xmath72=16.5 , h@xmath73=16.0 , k@xmath73=15.5 ) .",
    "as position we selected ( @xmath74=81@xmath68 , @xmath75=0@xmath68 ) .",
    "this coincides with the position of the dr21 star forming region and hence the quantitative results of this study can be applied for this area . for any other region in the sky",
    "only the qualitative part of the analysis can be applied ; for quantitative results the simulations described here have to be applied to the specific area .",
    "as mentioned , we determine only the extinction at a certain wavelength when using accumulative star counts , or we can determine the colour excess between two wavelengths .",
    "the conversion into optical extinction requires the knowledge of the extinction law . since we know",
    "the extinction law applied to generate the artificial data ( mathis ) , we are able to directly compute the optical extinction .",
    "this is what finally is used to estimate the reliability of our extinction determination procedure .",

    "we created an artificial catalogue , simulating a squared 0.5@xmath68x0.5@xmath68 cloud in the centre of a 2@xmath68x2@xmath68 field .    for each of these artificial datasets we determined the extinction map for the central 1@xmath68x1@xmath68 field and measured the mean and median extinction of the cloud in the central 0.25@xmath68x0.25@xmath68 .",

    "this can be explained since the noise should be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of stars in each box , and then inversely proportional to the box size . as box size for all subsequent analysis we chose 1.2 , which ensures on average 25 stars per box .",

    "the noise is given in magnitudes of @xmath1 . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     we have performed several tests in order to disentangle the different components contributing to the noise in the extinction maps .",
    "in particular : a ) the artificial coordinates of the stars in the field ; b ) the set of stars in the control field ; c ) the set of stars in the area of the cloud . the contribution to the noise from each of those three components can be determined from the scatter in the synthetic extinction maps , by varying one component and fixing the other two .",

    "this ensures that no foreground stars are present and we should be able to fully recover the applied extinction values of our artificial clouds , given the fact that we know the reddening law applied to the artificial data ( mathis ) . using accumulated star counts",

    "fig.[offset ] shows the variation of the offset with @xmath1 . in the following we discuss their cause .    for small extinction values ( @xmath80mag ) the deviations are smaller than 1@xmath26 . for higher extinction ( @xmath1 up to 7mag )",

    "this implies the reddening of the stars due to the dust in the cloud itself is the cause of the offsets .",

    "accumulative star counts ( solid lines ) and colour excess ( dashed lines ) extinction maps , prior to foreground stars selection , are shown .",
    "there are obvious differences between the two methods .",
    "the star counting method shows a steady decline of the measured extinction with increasing cloud distance . for the colour excess method at first only a very small decline with cloud distance",
    "is observed . after a certain critical distance",
    ", however , the measured extinction drops to zero .",
    "this is the distance at which more than half of the stars in the field are foreground to the cloud , and the median colour represent foreground stars .",
    "the higher the extinction in the cloud the smaller is the maximum distance up to which a cloud can be detected using colour excess since less background stars are detected in the field .    when investigating distant clouds , it is hence of advantage to use the star count extinction maps for foreground star identification . in our example in fig.[distance ]",
    "it is observed that we are not able to identify foreground stars in a 10mag @xmath1 cloud with a distance larger than 2kpc when using colour excess extinction maps .",

    "extinction maps from colour excess are usually less noisy but are less reliable for distant clouds .",
    "thus the extinction map that possesses the larger extinction values should be used for the foreground star selection .",
    "3 .   now one needs to iterate the first two steps until no further foreground stars are found .",
    "foreground stars can not be identified in regions without extinction .",
    "we thus have to consider the accumulated star count diagram of the foreground stars when determining the extinction map using star counts . using the colours of the identified foreground stars and monte - carlo techniques , a colour offset for background regions",

    "5 .   for a most accurate calibration determine the distance correction using the cloud distance and coordinates , as well as the completeness limit of the observations",
    "* we have explained _ how _ a map of the near infrared extinction powerlaw index can be determined from colour excess , star counting , or a combination of both .",
    "a detailed analysis of the uncertainties of each method is performed .",
    "we find that generally high s / n extinction measurements are required for a precision determination of @xmath0 .",

    "the resulting offsets , however , can be determined with the knowledge of the cloud position , distance and extinction , as well as the completeness limit of the photometric catalogue .",
