    "the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics insists that an entropy of a black hole plus a thermodynamic entropy of fields outside the horizon does not decrease @xcite , where the black hole entropy is defined as a quarter of the area of the horizon .",
    "namely it says that an entropy of the whole system does not decrease .",
    "it interests us in a quite physical sense since it links a world inside a black hole and our thermodynamic world .",
    "in particular it gives a physical meaning to black hole entropy indirectly since it concerns the sum of black hole entropy and ordinary thermodynamic entropy and physical meaning of the later is well - known by statistical mechanics .",
    "frolov and page proved the generalized second law for a quasi - stationary eternal black hole by assuming that a state of matter fields on the past horizon is thermal one and that a set of radiation modes on the past horizon and one on the past null infinity are quantum mechanically uncorrelated .",
    "the assumption is reasonable for the eternal case since a black hole emit a thermal radiation ( the hawking radiation ) .",
    "when we attempt to apply their proof to a non - eternal black hole which arises from a gravitational collapse , we might expect that things would go well by simply replacing the past horizon with a null surface at a moment of a formation of a horizon ( @xmath0 surface in _ figure _ [ fig : background ] ) .",
    "however , the expectation is disappointing since the assumption becomes ill in this case .",
    "the reason is that on a collapsing background the thermal radiation is observed not at the moment of the horizon formation but at the future null infinity and that any modes on the future null infinity have correlation with modes on the past null infinity located after the horizon formation .",
    "the correlation can be seen in the equation ( [ eqn : multi ] ) of this paper explicitly .",
    "thus , their proof does not hold for the case in which a black hole arises from a gravitational collapse . since astrophysically a black hole is thought to arise from a gravitational collapse , we want to prove the generalized second law in this case .    in this paper",
    "we prove the generalized second law for a quasi - stationary black hole which arises from a gravitational collapse . for this purpose",
    "we concentrate on an inequality between functionals of a density matrix since the generalized second law can be rewritten as an inequality between functionals of a density matrix of matter fields as shown in the sec .",
    "[ sec : gsl ] .",
    "we seek a method to prove that a special functional of a density matrix can not decrease under a physical evolution .",
    "( it is a generalization of a result by sorkin @xcite . ) to apply it to the system with a black hole and derive the generalized second law as its consequence we need to establish a property of physical evolution of matter fields around the black hole .",
    "thus , for concreteness , we investigate a real massless scalar field semiclassically in a curved background which describes gravitational collapse and calculate conditional probabilities which , as a whole , have almost all information about behaviors of the scalar field after the formation of the horizon .",
    "( the probability we seek is a generalization of one calculated by panangaden and wald . )",
    "using the result of the calculation , it is shown that a thermal density matrix of the scalar field at the past null infinity evolves to a thermal density matrix with the same temperature and the same chemical potential at the future null infinity , provided that the initial temperature and chemical potential are special values specified by the background geometry .",

    "these are generalizations of results of and @xcite respectively .",
    "now we make a comments on frolov and page s statement that their proof of the generalized second law may be applied to the case of the black hole formed by a gravitational collapse .",
    "their proof for a quasi - stationary eternal black hole is based on the following two assumptions : ( 1 ) a state of matter fields on the past horizon is thermal one ; ( 2 ) a set of radiation modes on the past horizon and one on the past null infinity are quantum mechanically uncorrelated .",
    "these two assumptions are reasonable for the eternal case since a black hole emit a thermal radiation . in the case of a black hole which arises from a gravitational collapse",
    ", we might expect that things would go well by simply replacing the past horizon with a null surface at a moment of a formation of a horizon ( @xmath0 surface in _ figure [ fig : background ] _ ) .",
    "however , a state of the matter fields on the past horizon is completely determined by a state of the fields before the horizon formation ( @xmath16 in _ figure _ [ fig : background ] ) , in which there is no causal effect of the existence of future horizon .",
    "since the essential origin of the thermal radiation from a black hole is the existence of a horizon , the state of the fields on the null surface has not to be a thermal one .",
    "hence the assumption ( 1 ) becomes ill in this case .",
    "although the above replacement may be the most extreme one , an intermediate replacement causes an intermediate violation of the assumption ( 1 ) due to the correlation between modes on the future null infinity and modes on the past null infinity located after the horizon formation .",
    "the correlation can be seen in ( [ eqn : multi ] ) explicitly .",
    "thus we conclude that their proof can not be applied to the case of the black hole formed by a gravitational collapse .",
    "finally we discuss a generalization of our proof to a dynamical background . for the case of a dynamical background @xmath95 and @xmath68",
    "are changed from time to time by a possible backreaction .",
    "thus , to prove the generalized second law for the dynamical background , we have to generalize theorem [ theorem : stability ] to the dynamical case consistently with the backreaction .",
    "once this can be achieved , theorem [ theorem : general ] seems useful to prove the generalized second law for the dynamical background .",
