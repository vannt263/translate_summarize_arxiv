    "the optical spectra of fullerene superconductors in the normal state were found to exhibit some unusual features @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity , @xmath0 , deviates considerably from the simple drude behavior expected for conventional metals : the spectral weight of the drude peak is reduced by about an order of magnitude and transfered to a mid - infrared ( mir ) region around @xmath3 ev .",
    "this suggests that the strong interaction effects due to the coulomb and electron - phonon interactions should be important in the optical spectra of the fullerenes . understanding this unusual behavior in the optical conductivty , therefore ,",
    "could reveal important information about the fullerenes and contribute to understanding other physical properties of the material .",
    "the optical conductivity @xmath0 represents the rate at which electrons absorb the incident photons at energy @xmath6 , and is a useful probe in determining electronic characteristics of the material under study . for an ideal free electron gas , where the interactions between the electrons , and between the electrons and phonons are neglected , and the impurity scattering rate @xmath7",
    ", @xmath0 collapses to a delta - function , @xmath8 , where the coefficient @xmath9 represents the total spectral weight . in this case , the optical conductivity sum rule , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the density and @xmath12 is the mass of the electrons , is exhausted entirely by the delta function drude contribution alone . when the material becomes dirtier , the drude peak of the optical conductivity acquires the lorentzian shape with the width of @xmath13 .",
    "the conductivity sum rule is still exhausted by the drude part alone when only the impurity scatterings are present in the system .",
    "the total weight @xmath9 , however , can change as the inpurity scatterings or other interactions are introduced when we consider a finite bandwidth , because the projection to a restricted basis set disregards all excitations to higher energy than the bandwidth .",
    "when other interactions are present , the free - carrier drude weight is reduced by the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , and the missing spectral weight from the drude part is transfered to a higher energy region of @xmath0 reflecting the excitation of incoherent scatterings .",
    "the experimentally measured @xmath0 in the normal state @xmath16 shows a remarkable reduction of drude weight and , concomitantly , a pronounced mir absorption below the inter - band absorption peak : degiorgi @xmath17 found a pronounced mir peak around 0.06 ev and analysized that the drude weight is reduced to about @xmath18 of the total intra - band spectral weight @xcite , while iwasa @xmath17 observed the mir absorption peak around 0.4 ev and determined that the drude weight is reduced to about 0.6 of the total intra - band spectral weight @xcite .",
    "although their results show somewhat different drude weight and mir absorption energy each other , the pronounced suppression of the drude weight and the accompanying mir absorption imply strong electron - phonon and/or electron - electron interactions in this material .    in order to understand this unusual feature in @xmath0 of doped fullerenes , gunnarsson @xmath19 studied the effects of the electron - phonon interaction on @xmath0 assuming that the migdal theorem is valid @xcite .",
    "they showed that the electron - phonon interaction leads to a narrowing of the drude peak by the factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant , and a transfer of the depleted drude weight to a mir region at somewhat larger energies than the phonon energy .",
    "their results , however , are far from sufficient to describe experimental observations .",
    "therefore , they hinted that the coulomb interaction between conduction electrons , which is neglected in their study , could lead to futher reduction of the drude weight and more pronounced mir absorption . on the other hand , one of the present authors recently found , by studying the nmr coherence peak supression in the fullerene superconductors , that the coulomb interaction between conduction electrons , characterized by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the effective coulomb interaction and @xmath24 is the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , should be included in addition to the electron - phonon interaction to understand the various experimental observations in fullerenes in a coherent way @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , included the electron - electron as well as electron - phonon interactions at the presence of the impurity scatterings in the present paper , to better understand the experimentally obsered unusual features in the optical spectra of the fullerene superconductors in the normal state .    for fullerene superconductors , the fermi energy @xmath25 ev and the average phonon frequency @xmath26 ev , where @xmath27 is the bandwidth .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 for fullerenes unlike conventional metals , where @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath28 , the phonon vertex correction becomes important because the migdal theorem does not hold @xcite , and the frequency dependence of the effective coulomb interaction , @xmath30 , should be considered because the frequency scale at which @xmath31 varies is comparable with that of electron - phonon interaction @xcite . in this present work , concerned with the effects of the coulomb and electron - phonon interactions on the optical spectra in the narrow band fullerene superconductors , the vertex correction is incorporated in calculating the electron self - energy @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction , modelled in terms of the onsite hubbard repulsion , is included on an equal footing with the electron - phonon interaction , and considered fully self - consistently in calculating the effective electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "the effective electron - electron interaction becomes frequency dependent through the screening .",
    "the impurity effects are included with the @xmath32-matrix approximation .    through the relation ( ip )",

    "then , the optical conductivity can be obtained by calculating the current - current correlation function , @xmath41 , using the renormalized green s function obtained from solving eq.@xmath42 ( [ s1 ] ) self - consistently .",
    "the calculated optical conductivity shows a strong reduction of drude weight and a broad mir absorption , although the mir feature around 0.06 ev is less pronounced and broader compared with experimental observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we present the eliashberg - type formalism in the matsubara frequency to calculate the renormalized green s function with the impurity , electron - phonon , and coulomb interactions included self - consistently .",

    "the coulomb interaction suppresses the drude part substantially by inducing @xmath6 dependence of the renormalization function @xmath37 in the low frequency region .",
    "we think that the large reduction of drude weight like the degiorgi experiment is a result of the strong coulomb interaction between conduction electrons in addtion to the electron - phonon interaction",

    "it is generally accepted that the fullerene superconductor could be characterized by the phonon - mediated @xmath107-wave superconductor @xcite . however , a few experiments like optical conductivity still remain not understood by the electron - phonon scattering together with the disorder effects .",
    "our motivation lies in that the fullerene superconductors have such a narrow bandwidth that the phonon frequency , the coulomb interaction , and the fermi energy are all comparable , @xmath108 . in order to consider properly the coulomb interaction and the narrow bandwidth of fullerene superconductors , the self - consistent eliashberg - type coupled equations are solved to obtain the renormalized green s function .",
    "the theory includes the frequency dependent screened coulomb interaction together with the electron - phonon interaction and includes the vertex correction via nambu s method . in order to treat the vertex function exactly",
    ", analytic continuation is performed via the iterative method of mixed repersentation which is developed by takada .",
    "once we get renormalization function @xmath37 in real frequency , we can calculate optical conductivity in normal states .",
    "as we expected , the electron - phonon interaction is not suffficient to resolve the substantial reduction of drude weight and pronounced mir peak .",
    "the strong coulomb interaction induces @xmath6 dependence in renormalization function @xmath37 . as a result , the drude form in optical spectra",
    "is distorted accompanying the reduction of drude weight .",
    "when the impurity effect is enhanced , the mir absopption induced by strong coulomb interaction merge together with the mir peaks due to electron - phonon scattering showing large reduction of drude weight and mir peak around @xmath3 ev . although it is not sufficent to explain experimentally founded results ,",
    "our result is close to degiorgi s experiment .",
    "we improve gunnarsonn s calculation by considering the electron - electron interaction and finite bandwidth effects explicitly . in conclusion ,",
