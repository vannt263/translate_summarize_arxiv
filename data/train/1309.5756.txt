    "in ref.@xcite , the nel state was considered because it is the natural ground state for @xmath13 .",
    "however , here we are interested in the theoretical ( fundamental ) problem of how much entanglement between distant spins can be generated from separable states and a global switch of couplings .",
    "the whole class of separable states is enormous as well as the class of product states of several spins .",
    "thus we examine here the canted order pure initial state @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this initial state may be prepared in several ways .",
    "the most obvious way is to have an _ uncoupled _ hamiltonian and a magnetic field varying in direction from site to site which tilts spins accordingly . even with a magnetic field varying only in one ( say the @xmath17 ) direction",
    ", one can prepare the above state for @xmath18 as the ground state of the coupled hamiltonian @xmath19 with @xmath20 increasing with the site number , the ground state is a chain in which each spin is tilted counter - clockwise with an angle @xmath21 compared with the left neighboring spin ( fig .  [ cantedstate ] ) .",
    "after nel order , a canted order is a next level of generalization that we can make for an initial product state of a spin chain .",
    "we are motivated by the scope of solving for the entanglement of the distant end spins analytically for the given initial state .",
    "it is with this view of making analytic progress that we let the system with the canted order initial state evolve with the @xmath11 hamiltonian .",
    "one can regard this as an instantaneous change ( or a quench ) from an uncoupled hamiltonian with local magnetic fields or the hamiltonian @xmath22 to the @xmath11 hamiltonian . also note that in ref.@xcite it was found that @xmath23 with @xmath24 is worse in terms of generating entanglement in comparison to the case of @xmath10 .",
    "this can be regarded as another motivation for evolving the system with @xmath11 hamiltonian .",
    "so one first prepares a canted order initial state of a few spins by one of the means described in the previous section and then , at time @xmath12 suddenly switches on a @xmath11 hamiltonian interaction between them .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement produced between spins @xmath25 and @xmath1 as a function of time due to this @xmath11 hamiltonian , @xmath26 .    )",
    ".,width=264 ]     + to make progress , we first use the jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , to write the hamiltonian in terms of fermionic operators and then diagonalize @xmath26 to get the fermionic operators in the heisenberg picture @xmath30 @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to study the entanglement generated between the distant ends of the chain ( @xmath34 ) we find the reduced density matrix in the basis @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we will show the evaluation of one matrix element , say @xmath40 , and the rest of the elements are found similarly .",
    "the matrix element @xmath40 is @xmath41 where we used @xmath42 .",
    "hence @xmath43 now we have 3 cases , first if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 second , if @xmath46 , then @xmath47    where we used @xmath48 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 similarly we can find analytic expressions for all the matrix elements of @xmath51 .",
    "however , these expressions , of the form of eq.([analytic ] ) , have themselves to be evaluated numerically by virtue of the long products involved . this evaluation can be carried out efficiently even for very large values of @xmath1 .",
    "after having determined the elements of @xmath51 , we are now in a position to compute the entanglement between spins @xmath25 and @xmath1 as a function of time .",
    "one way of quantifying the entanglement is to compute the concurrence , which is a measure of entanglement for two qubits @xcite .",
    "however , note that this entanglement will , in the end , be used for teleporting arbitrary quantum states between two registers so that it is the  fully entangled fraction \" rather than some measure of entanglement , which is the more relevant figure of merit .",
    "one would first apply the entanglement purification protocol in which a given number of copies of the state @xmath51 can be converted , by local actions at both ends and classical communication , to a smaller number of maximally entangled states which can then be used for teleportation @xcite . in order to test the possibility of the purification procedure we use the _ fully entangled fraction _",
    "defined as @xmath52 where the maximum is taken over all maximally entangled states @xmath53 .",
    "the purification procedure is possible if @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we were to use the state @xmath51 itself for teleportation , then the fidelity of the teleported state is given by @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we will thus also compute the fully entangled fraction @xmath56 for @xmath51 as a function of time and the canting angle @xmath21 , as this is much more indicative of the eventual application in connecting quantum registers , namely teleportation .",
    "+ figs  [ cantedordern24 ] and [ cantedordern50 ] show the dynamics of the fully entangled fraction and the concurrence of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath21 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 spins respectively .",
    "clearly , at around a scaled time very close to @xmath59 ( in fact the time is slightly larger than @xmath60 ) and for the nel state , a state @xmath51 with the highest fully entangled fractions @xmath61 ( for @xmath57 ) and @xmath62 ( for @xmath58 ) is generated , which will not only directly allow one to teleport a state with a fidelities of @xmath63 ( for @xmath57 ) and @xmath64 ( for @xmath58 ) , but also enable entanglement purification ( using many copies of @xmath51 ) to obtain a state giving perfect teleportation fidelity .",
    "we focused here on the first emergence in time of long range entanglement .",
    "we note the sharp peak in the entanglement at @xmath65 which corresponds to the nel state .",
    "this means that the proposed scheme generates entanglement for a nel state and not for the general canted order state .",
    "the narrowness of the peak in @xmath21 , fig .",
    "[ peakwidth ] , is especially striking implying essentially that unless a canted order state is _ extremely close _ to the nel state it is ill - suited for generating any long distance entanglement .",
    "this uniqueness of the nel state among all the canted order states is one of our principal findings that adds to the knowledge with respect to ref.@xcite , where the high entanglement generating ability of only the nel state was noted .",
    "we will attempt to provide an explanation of this effect in the section on discussions in a later part of the paper .     and @xmath1 of the chain for @xmath57 as a function of the canting angle @xmath21 .",

    "there may be other states which are easy to prepare as initial states in practice in various physical realizations .",
    "as long as their entanglement is not long range to start with , the quench induced dynamics still serves its purpose of generating long distance entanglement .",
    "we can thus look at an initial state which is a product of states where spins are entangled only with their nearest neighbors , namely a product of bell states .",
    "we now consider the following product of bell states as the initial state @xmath68 the above state can be implemented using cold atoms in an optical superlattice formed by two independent lattices with different periods . applying a spin - dependent",
    "energy offset results in pairs of singlets .",

    "we note that the behavior is similar to the case of nel state .",
    "it shows that the initial state of a series of bell pairs act very similarly to the nel state in terms of entanglement generation ( maximally entangled fractions of @xmath89 and @xmath90 at times close to ( slightly higher than ) @xmath59 .     versus the chain length , ( b ) the time at which the first peak of entanglement occurs versus the chain length.,width=529 ]    ) .",

    "in any experimental implementation , some disorders will be present and might affect the resulting entanglement @xcite . to measure the robustness of our scheme we consider two types of disorder .",
    "first we study the effect of a small disorder in the preparation of the initial nel state .",
    "we consider a random single spin flip with a probability @xmath94 , i.e. the initial density matrix is @xmath95 figure  [ canteddisorder ] shows the resulting fully entangled fraction for @xmath57 and @xmath58 with probabilities @xmath96 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "the entanglement at @xmath97 is not seriously affected with such disorder with a spin flip probability as large as @xmath98 and @xmath97 is also unchanged .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this scheme for generating entanglement is also robust to randomness in the couplings throughout the chain for an initial nel state .",
    "we consider the effect of such disorder for an initial series of bell pairs .",

    "figure  [ singletsdisorder ] shows the resulting entanglement for @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "the entanglement is not seriously suppressed for an average offset as large as @xmath104 of the @xmath4 and @xmath97 is nearly unchanged .",
    "spin models with the possibility of long time coherent dynamics are now being realized in some physical systems such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and trapped ions . here",
    "we outline the schematics of an implementation with ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "firstly a spin chain in an appropriate state has to be prepared .",
    "1d tubes of light trapping atoms in a lattice are now quite routine @xcite .",
    "the initial state can be prepared by dimerizing the lattice to a series of double wells .",
    "simply dimerizing it would produce a series of bell states as in ref.@xcite , which would be the starting state for the scheme discussed in section [ bs ] .",
    "further , by having a magnetic field gradient between the two wells of the lattice , one can also prepare a series of @xmath105 or @xmath106 in double wells , and thereby the spin texture of one of the nel states when many such wells are arranged in a series in a superlattice @xcite .",
    "the local control which is now possible in combination of digital spatial light modulators and microwave pulses @xcite should also enable one to prepare arbitrary spin textures if the results of section [ canted ] are to be verified .",
    "the sudden quenching ( switching on ) of the interactions is done by lowering the barriers between neighboring wells at time @xmath12 in a time - scale much faster ( say , a @xmath107 ) than @xmath108 , which has been achieved quite recently @xcite . in our setup , an open ended spin chain ( in other words , a hard wall boundary )",
    "is required for the reflections .",
    "this should be achievable quite soon using the technique of digital light modulators which can eventually influence potentials at the scale of lattice site separations @xcite . the readout of spins of the end sites to verify the entanglement should be achievable using quantum gas microscope technique @xcite .",
    "entangling distant spins is desirable for connecting separated quantum registers through teleportation .",
    "we find that it can be achieved by exploiting the dynamics of a spin chain after a quench .",
    "we find that obtaining a high entanglement can depend sensitively on the initial magnetic order .",
    "for example , an initial nel state is an excellent resource , while more general canted order states hardly give any entanglement .",
    "additionally , we found that a state composed of a product of singlets represent an excellent resource for generating entanglement when quenching the system by the @xmath11 hamiltonian .",
    "our scheme can be implemented experimentally using , for example , ultracold atoms in optical lattices in which most of the requirements have been achieved lately , and an outline for the implementation is discussed in section [ impl ] .",
    "of course , the entanglement , while long range , is _ not distance independent _ in this scheme  it falls with the length @xmath1 of the chain .",
    "this dependence , as well as the time needed to achieve the peak in entanglement , is plotted in fig.[scaling ] .",
    "note that for an initial product of bell states , for shorter chains , the entanglement produced is slightly lower than that produced from the nel state  though it catches up asymptotically as @xmath1 increases .",
    "moreover , note from the slope of the line in fig.[scaling](b ) that the time needed is always linear in @xmath1 i.e. , @xmath109 . with the velocity of a spin flip in the @xmath11 chain being @xmath110 ,",
    "this is the time needed for a spin flip to travel half the length of the chain .",
    "note also from fig.[scaling](a ) that even for very large chains ( @xmath111 ) the maximally entangled fraction remains above @xmath112 ( i.e. , still useful for distillation ) .    before concluding we provide the reader with some intuitive understanding of our results .",
    "firstly , let us first clarify the non - triviality of our results .",
    "basically , it is known ( and expected ) that a non - zero entanglement will develop between complementary blocks of a spin chain after a quench , simply because of entangled quasiparticles crossing the boundary between the blocks @xcite . however , the spins at the two ends are  non - complementary \" parts of the chain . the part of the chain between the two spins serves as an environment .",
    "thus for a state of the ends to be significantly entangled , it is required that the intervening chain be in the _ same state _ corresponding to distinct states of the end spins .",
    "to further clarify the situation , note that the hamiltonian here conserves the number of spin flips .",
    "thus states @xmath113 and @xmath114 of the end spins can not have any coherence between them as they necessarily involve a different number of flips in the part of the chain between the spins .",
    "the only possibility of coherence is between the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 of the spin chain .",
    "however , though dynamics may produce the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 at the end spins , it is not guaranteed that the rest of the spin chain will be in the same state irrespective of whether the state @xmath115 or @xmath116 is generated between the end spins  without that , there would be no entanglement between the end spins .",
    "it is highly nontrivial to ensure that the dynamics results in the central part of the chain being in the same state corresponding to @xmath115 and @xmath116 states .",
    "because of reasons presented below , the hamiltonian governing our dynamics and our initial state ensures this .",
    "it is additionally nontrivial that the amount of the entanglement between the end spins would be high .",
    "why this is the case is explained in the following paragraphs .",
    "we now proceed to explain the result that apart from states very close to the nel state , any other canted order state gives a vanishing entanglement and fully entangled fraction .",
    "this is because of the principal mechanism through which entanglement is generated from the nel state . for simplicity",
    ", we will present our explanation for odd @xmath1 chains . as shown in fig.[expl",
    "] , each up spin is the location of a fermion .",
    "the evolution is due to a free fermion model , so each fermion starts evolving in the chain as if other fermions were absent except for the phase factor the wave - function acquires upon pairwise exchange of fermions .",
    "each fermion evolves in a superposition of left and right moving fermions , doing a so called quantum walk on the chain .",
    "this moving in a superposition of left and right creates , for example , from a configuration @xmath117 in 3 successive sites a configuration of the form @xmath118 , which , after factoring out the @xmath119 of the central site , is an entangled state @xmath120 .",
    "this is how each fermion acts as a source of an entangled state in the chain @xcite .",
    "we will now justify why the simultaneous walk of all the fermions together then creates a highly entangled state between sites @xmath25 and @xmath1 at an optimal time . at time @xmath92 , where @xmath121 is the velocity of fermions , the fermion at the exact centre of the chain will create , with some finite probability , a bell state @xmath120 between the sites @xmath25 and @xmath1 because of the symmetry of the left and right walk .",
    "this is the @xmath91 fermion in fig.[expl ] , which shows the distribution of this fermion after a quantum walk for a time @xmath92 .",
    "note , from fig.[expl ] that this fermion swaps its position with an equal number ( in this case 3 ) of other fermions during its traversal to both the left and the right ends of the chain .",
    "thus the relative phase between the left ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) and the right ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) components is @xmath122 .",
    "the same holds for a fermion originating at any other site of the chain as both the left moving and the right moving components cross either an even number or an odd number of fermions ( for example , in fig.[expl ] the @xmath93 fermion crosses 1 fermion on the left and 5 fermions on the right to reach the ends ) .",
    "moreover , the initial placement of fermions on odd sites of the chain also ensures that the relative phase between the single fermion transition amplitudes ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) from their original site to the left and the right ends ( when no other fermion is present ) is also @xmath122 as each fermion acquires a factor of @xmath125 per hop .. ] for example , the @xmath93 fermion shown in fig.[expl ] has 2 hops to reach the left end , giving a phase @xmath126 , while it has 10 hops to the right end , which gives a phase @xmath127 .",
    "thus the fermions originating on an arbitrary site of the chain , would , in general , contribute entangled states of the form @xmath128 to the end sites ( this contribution , in general , could be mixed with @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 can both be taken to be real and positive ( the global phase outside @xmath128 does not matter as each fermion starts from a distinct location and has a distinct evolution , so that the entangled state stemming from each fermion is incoherently added up to those from the others to generate the final state of the two end spins ) . in general @xmath131 , as clear for the @xmath93 fermion in fig.[expl ] ( only for the central fermion , for example for @xmath91 in fig.[expl ] , is @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus the coefficient of the off - diagonal term @xmath133 contributed by each fermion is @xmath134 , which is positive , and add up together to make a substantial off - diagonal term of the total density matrix .",
    "the entanglement is substantial because this off - diagonal term is substantial .",
    "now imagine that there is a small probability of @xmath135 for a fermion to be absent from a site were it was supposed to be present .",
    "this is a small deviation from the nel state .",
    "this causes a state of the form @xmath136 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 both real and positive , to be generated because if the left moving component of a fermion s state crosses an even number of other fermions then the right moving component crosses an odd number of other fermions and vice - versa . in fig.[expl ] , for example , if the fermion at the @xmath137 site was absent , then the central @xmath138 fermion would cross 2 fermions on its left , while it would still cross 3 fermions to its right .",
    "this will reduce the off - diagonal term by subtracting a proportion @xmath139 from it .",
    "a very similar result holds when an extra fermion is present at a site were it was not supposed to be .",
    "imagine , for example , the state of the @xmath140 site in fig.[expl ] was up instead of being as depicted .",
    "while this extra fermion itself will still create a state @xmath128 , as can be verified by counting its number of hops and fermion crossings in reaching the ends , _ all _ other fermions will now contribute a state @xmath136 , by virtue of one extra fermion being now being crossed on either its leftward or its rightward walk to the ends .",
    "thus overwhelmingly the presence of an extra fermion still results in contributions @xmath141 to the original state . as there are @xmath1 sites in which a single spin flip error can occur , as soon as @xmath142 , the contributions of the form @xmath143 become of the order of unity and cancel contributions of the form @xmath144 arising from the error - free nel state .",
    "thus for very low errors of the magnitude @xmath142 about the nel state , the entanglement completely vanishes .",
    "the canted ordered state , in fact , can be regarded as quite a systematic error whose probability @xmath135 increases from the left to the right of the chain , and thereby @xmath145 falls so rapidly with @xmath1 .",
    "thus the generated entanglement is quite rapidly lost as canting angles start deviating from the nel ordered state .",
    "the starting resource of bell states is a case were we are starting with states @xmath146 on neighboring sites , which is as entangled as the state that is created after a one step ( left and right in superposition ) evolution of a single fermion from the nel state .",
    "the similarities of the resources near the starting point of the evolution is thereby responsible for both the product of bell states and the nel state being excellent resources for establishing entanglement .",

    "<S> we study the problem of entangling two spins at the distant ends of a spin chain by exploiting the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system after a sudden global quench . as initial states we consider a canted / spiral order product state of the spins , and singlets of neighboring pairs of spins . </S>",
    "<S> we find that within the class of canted order initial states , _ no _ entanglement is generated at any time _ except _ for the special case of the nel state . while an earlier work had shown that the nel state is indeed an excellent starting resource for the dynamical generation of long distance entanglement , the curious fact that this is the sole point within a large class of initial product states of the spins was not noted . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we find that an initial state which is a series of nearest neighbor bell states , and well motivated by some physical realizations , is also a good starting resource for end to end entanglement in a similar way to the nel state . the scheme is shown to be robust to random single spin flip in the initial nel state as well as randomness of the couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement induced between distinct parts of a many - body system due to the nonequilibrium dynamics following quenches have attracted much attention recently . </S>",
    "<S> this has been largely motivated by experimental developments which allow for the realization of long time nonequilibrium dynamics  notably with ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the potential for realizing such dynamics in ion traps has been also pointed out in both theoretical studies @xcite , as well as the realization of spin chains @xcite . some studies have examined the time development of entanglement between complementary blocks of a one dimensional spin system @xcite as well as between _ proximal _ spins @xcite . however , in the field of quantum information , it is most desirable to achieve long range entanglement , i.e. , the entanglement between two individual spins separated by a significant distance . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is essential for teleportation of a quantum state over a distance @xcite and thereby to link well separated quantum registers . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this point , studies have also been made of the creation of long - range entanglement between the end spins of a spin chain through the nonequilibrium dynamics that follows a quench . </S>",
    "<S> the first study in this context considered a chain of harmonic oscillators which were suddenly coupled @xcite . for spin chains , </S>",
    "<S> the first study in this context considered a sudden quench in the ising anisotropy parameter of a @xmath0 model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was a _ global quench _ in the sense that all couplings of the hamiltonian of a system were changed in the _ same way _ by the quench . </S>",
    "<S> such quenches may be easier to realize in systems with limited local addressability such as for ultracold atoms in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can also suddenly change a local coupling , as may be easier in gate controlled systems such as quantum dots coupled to leads , and for a spin chain version of such systems , called kondo systems , the mechanism to generate entanglement has also been worked out @xcite . other mechanisms to generate entanglement between distant spins may involve kicked systems @xcite or long distance state swap induced quantum gates @xcite , which also seems feasible in optical lattices and solid state spin chains in diamonds ( see also alternative mechanism for entanglement distribution through the latter in ref.@xcite ) . alternatively , there are also various _ </S>",
    "<S> static mechanisms _ for generating long distance entanglement between the end spins of a spin chain @xcite-@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that generating entanglement between the end spins of a spin chain is a slightly different problem than directly using a spin chain as a data - bus for transferring quantum states , on which much work has been done ( e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) . without really going into the details of the comparison of the various methods for the generation of long distance entanglement , here we wish to consider the question of whether entanglement can be generated between distant spins while starting off with a _ product _ state or a state were entanglement is initially very local ( e.g. a product of bell states ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism will be the unitary dynamics induced by a global quench . within a wide class of product states , we will find that a certain state emerges as the _ only one _ which generates a non - zero entanglement between distant spins . </S>",
    "<S> this study illustrates how important the initial magnetic order in the spin chain is , if one is to generate a long distance entanglement from a global quench . while such sensitivity is not good from a practical point of view , it is nonetheless really important to be aware of this so that one is adequately careful about the preparation of the initial state in any physical realization of this protocol . on the other hand we will find that starting with a linear array of local singlets is also a good starting point for the generation of long distance entanglement and this might for certain realizations , provide a more practical starting point . + an earlier work @xcite considered a one dimensional chain of @xmath1 spin-@xmath2 systems described by the @xmath0 hamiltonian , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling strength , @xmath5 is the anisotropy parameter and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pauli operators acting on a site @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that quenching the anisotropy parameter from @xmath9 , which corresponds to a nel state , to @xmath10 , which is the @xmath11 hamiltonian , resulted in the evolution of the end spins to a highly entangled state without requiring any local control of the spins . </S>",
    "<S> it is precisely to generalize this work that we consider two initial states : a canted / spiral order product state and a product of singlets . </S>",
    "<S> the preparation of the initial states as the ground state of a hamiltonian is now not our principal concern , but it is clearly possible with uncoupled and dimerized hamiltonians . with the system placed in the above initial states by some means , we assume that a @xmath11 hamiltonian is switched on at time @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the system then evolves according to the @xmath11 hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we then study analytically the entanglement generated between the distant ends of the chain due to the dynamics following our quench ( here by quench we mean the sudden switching on of the couplings so as to make the system behave as a @xmath11 spin chain ) . </S>"
