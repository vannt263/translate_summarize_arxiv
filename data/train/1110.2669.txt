    "alloying elements with complementary qualities in order to tailor their physical behavior for specific technological purposes has been a major route in material development since the antiquity .",
    "cluster research is no exception to this trend .",
    "after decades of systematic studies of the size and structural dependence of the most wide variety of properties of monoelement particles , the interest has actually been moving progressively over the past years towards investigations on finite - size binary alloys.@xcite the magnetism of transition - metal ( tm ) clusters opens numerous possibilities and challenges in this context .",
    "for example , one would like to understand how to modify the magnetic characteristics of clusters , in particular the saturation magnetization and the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) , as it has been done in solids .",
    "this would indeed allow one to design new nanostructured materials from a microscopic perspective .",
    "nevertheless , it also true that controlling composition , system size , and magnetic behavior sets serious difficulties for both experiment and theory .",
    "pure tm clusters such as fe@xmath9 , co@xmath9 and ni@xmath9 show spin moments , orbital moments , and maes that are enhanced with respect to the corresponding periodic solids.@xcite still , the possibilities of optimizing the cluster magnetic behavior by simply tuning the system size have been rather disappointing , particularly concerning the mae , which remains relatively small despite being orders of magnitude larger than in solids@xcite due to the rather weak spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in the @xmath10 atoms .",
    "this is one of the motivations for alloying @xmath10 tms with @xmath11 and @xmath12 elements which , being heavier , are subject to stronger so interactions . in this context",
    "it is useful to recall that large nanoparticles and three dimensional solids of these elements are non - magnetic .",
    "however , at very small sizes the @xmath11 and @xmath12 clusters often develop a finite spontaneous low - temperature magnetization , due to the reduction of local coordination and the resulting @xmath7-band narrowing.@xcite the first experimental observation of this important finite - size effect has been made by cox _",
    "et al . _ by performing stern - gerlach - deflection measurements on rh@xmath9 clusters . in this work",
    "the average magnetic moments per atom @xmath5 = @xmath13@xmath14 have been experimentally determined for @xmath15@xmath16 atoms.@xcite in view of these contrasting features one expects that @xmath10-@xmath11 and @xmath10-@xmath12 alloy clusters should show very interesting structural , electronic and magnetic behaviors .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the ground - state properties of the small ferh clusters in the framework of hohenberg - kohn - sham s density functional theory.@xcite besides the general interest of the problem from the perspective of @xmath10-@xmath11 nanomagnetism , these clusters are particularly appealing because of the remarkable phase diagram of ferh bulk alloys.@xcite in the case of @xmath17 the magnetic order at normal pressure and low temperatures is antiferromagnetic ( af ) .",
    "as the temperature increases this @xmath18 phase undergoes a first order transition to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , the @xmath19 phase , which is accompanied by a change in lattice parameter .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature @xmath20 increases rapidly with increasing external pressure p , eventually displacing the fm @xmath19 phase completely for @xmath21  gpa ( @xmath22 for @xmath17 at normal pressure ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 decreases very rapidly with decreasing rh content . at low pressures the fm @xmath19 phase undergoes a fm to paramagnetic ( pm ) transition at ( @xmath23).@xcite in addition ,",
    "the properties of @xmath24-ferh bulk alloys have been the subject of first principles and model theoretical investigations.@xcite in particular these show that the relative stability of the fm and af solutions depends strongly on the interatomic distances .",
    "such remarkable condensed - matter effects enhance the appeal of small ferh particles as specific example of @xmath10-@xmath11 nanoscale alloy .",
    "investigations of their magnetic properties as a function of size , composition , and structure are therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : teo ] the main details of the theoretical background and computational procedure are presented .",
    "this includes in particular a description of the strategy used for exploring the cluster energy landscape as a function of geometrical conformation and chemical order .",
    "the results of our calculations for ferh clusters having @xmath8 atoms are reported in secs .",
    "[ sec : stmagn ] and [ sec : comp ] .",
    "first , we focus on the interplay between structure , chemical order and magnetism in the most stable geometries for different cluster sizes .",
    "second , we analyze the concentration dependence of the cohesive energy , the local and average magnetic moments , and the spin - polarized electronic structure . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] with a summary of the main trends and an outlook to future extensions .",
    "the calculations reported in this work have been performed in the framework of hohenberg - kohn - sham s density functional theory,@xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the exchange and correlation energy is described by using both the spin - polarized local density approximation ( lda ) and perdew and wang s generalized - gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the vasp solves the spin - polarized kohn - sham equations in an augmented plane - wave basis set , taking into account the core electrons within the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite this is an efficient frozen - core all - electron approach which allows to incorporate the proper nodes of the kohn - sham orbitals in the core region and the resulting effects on the electronic structure , total energy and interatomic forces .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath10 orbitals of fe , and the @xmath26 and @xmath11 orbitals of rh are treated as valence states .",
    "the wave functions are expanded in a plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off @xmath27  ev . in order to improve the convergence of the solution of the selfconsistent ks equations the discrete energy levels are broadened by using a gaussian smearing @xmath28  ev .",
    "the validity of the present choice of computational parameters has been verified.@xcite the paw sphere radii for fe and rh are @xmath29   and @xmath30   , respectively .",
    "a simple cubic supercell is considered with the usual periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the linear size of the cell is @xmath31 = @xmath32@xmath33   , so that any pair of images of the clusters are well separated and the interaction between them is negligible . since we are interested in finite systems , the reciprocal space summations are restricted to the @xmath34 point .",
    "although the potential advantages of alloying magnetic @xmath10 elements with highly - polarizable @xmath11 or @xmath12 elements can be grasped straightforwardly , the problem involves a number of serious practical challenges . different growth or synthesis conditions can lead to different chemical orders , which can be governed not just by energetic reasons but by kinetic processes as well .",
    "for instance , one may have to deal with segregated clusters having either a @xmath11 core and a @xmath10 outer shell or vice versa .",
    "post - synthesis manipulations can induce different degrees of intermixing , including for example surface diffusion or disordered alloys .",
    "moreover , the inter atomic distances are also expected to depend strongly on size and composition .",
    "typical tm - cluster bond - lengths are in fact @xmath32@xmath35% smaller than in the corresponding bulk crystals . taking into account that itinerant @xmath36-electron magnetism is most sensitive to the local and chemical environments of the atoms,@xcite it is clear that controlling the distribution of the elements within the cluster is crucial for understanding magnetic nanoalloys .",
    "systematic theoretical studies of binary - metal clusters are hindered by the diversity of geometrical conformations , ordered and disorder arrangements , as well as segregation tendencies that have to be taken into account .",
    "this poses a serious challenge to both first - principles and model approaches . in order to determine the interplay between cluster structure , chemical order and magnetism in ferh clusters we have performed a comprehensive set of electronic calculations for clusters having @xmath37 atoms . in the present paper we focus on the most stable cluster structure and magnetic configuration , which are determined by exploring the ground - state energy landscape.@xcite",
    "this is a formidable task , since one needs to consider a large , most possibly complete and unbiased set of initial structures .",
    "such a thorough geometry optimization must include not only the representative cluster geometries or topologies , but also all relevant chemical orders .",
    "this requires taking into account all distributions of the fe and rh atoms for any given size and composition .",
    "these two aspects of the problem of determining the structure of nanoalloys are discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "the different cluster topologies are sampled by generating all possible graphs for @xmath38 atoms as described in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) . for each graph or adjacency matrix",
    "it is important to verify that it can be represented by a true structure in @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "a graph is acceptable as a cluster structure , only if a set of atomic coordinates @xmath40 with @xmath41 exists , such that the interatomic distances @xmath42 satisfy the conditions @xmath43 if the sites @xmath44 and @xmath45 are connected in the graph ( i.e. , if the adjacency matrix element @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 otherwise ( i.e. , if @xmath48 ) . here",
    "@xmath49 refers to the nearest neighbor ( nn ) distance , which at this stage can be regarded as the unit of length , assuming for simplicity that it is the same for all clusters .",
    "notice that for @xmath50 all graphs are possible cluster structures .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 , the different structures are the tetrahedron , rhombus , square , star , triangular racket and linear chain.@xcite however , for @xmath52 there are graphs , i.e. , topologies , which can not be realized in practice .",
    "for instance , it is not possible to have five atoms being nns from each other in a three dimensional space .",
    "consequently , for @xmath52 there are less real structures than mathematical graphs .",
    "the total number of graphs ( structures ) is 21 ( 20 ) , 112 ( 104 ) , and 853 ( 647 ) for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively.@xcite    for clusters having @xmath55 atoms all these topologies have indeed been taken as starting points of our structural relaxations . out of this large number of different initial configurations the unconstrained relaxations using vasp lead to only a few geometries , which can be regarded as stable or metastable isomers . for larger clusters ( @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 ) we do not aim at performing a full global optimization .",
    "our purpose here is to explore the interplay between magnetism and chemical order as a function of composition for a few topologies that are representative of open and close - packed structures .",
    "taking into account our results for smaller sizes , and the available information on the structure of pure fe@xmath9 and rh@xmath9 clusters , we have restricted the set of starting topologies for the unconstrained relaxation of ferh heptamers and octamers to the following : bicapped trigonal bipyramid , capped octahedra , and pentagonal bipyramid for @xmath3 , and tricapped trigonal bipyramid , bicapped octahedra , capped pentagonal bipyramid and cube for @xmath56 .",
    "although , the choice of topologies for @xmath3 and @xmath4 is quite restricted , it includes compact as well as more open structures .",
    "therefore , it is expected to shed light on the dependence of the magnetic properties on the chemical order and composition .",
    "the dependence on concentration is investigated systematically for each topology of fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 by varying @xmath59 and for each size @xmath1 , including the pure fe@xmath9 and rh@xmath9 limits .",
    "moreover , we take into account all possible non - equivalent distributions of the @xmath59 fe and @xmath60 rh atoms within the cluster . in this way ,",
    "any _ a priori _ assumption on the chemical order is avoided .",
    "obviously , such an exhaustive combinatorial search increasingly complicates the computational task as we increase the cluster size , and as we move away from pure clusters towards alloys with equal concentrations . finally , in order to perform the actual density - functional calculations we set for simplicity all nn distances in the starting cluster geometry equal to the fe bulk value@xcite @xmath61   .",
    "subsequently , a fully unconstrained geometry optimization is performed from first principles by using the vasp.@xcite the atomic positions are fully relaxed by means of conjugate gradient or quasi - newtonian methods , without imposing any symmetry constraints , until all the force components are smaller than the threshold @xmath62  mev /  .",
    "the convergence criteria are set to @xmath63  ev /  for the energy gradient , and @xmath64   for the atomic displacements.@xcite the same procedure applies to all considered clusters regardless of composition , chemical order , or total magnetic moment . notice that the diversity of geometrical structures and atomic arrangements often yields many local minima on the ground - state energy surface , which complicates significantly the location of the lowest - energy configuration .",
    "lattice structure and magnetic behavior are intimately related in tms , particularly in weak ferromagnets such as fe and its alloys.@xcite on the one side , the optimum structure and chemical order depend on the actual magnetic state of the cluster as given by the average magnetic moment per atom @xmath5 and the magnetic order . on the other side ,",
    "the magnetic behavior is known to be different for different structures and concentrations .",
    "therefore , in order to rigorously determine the ground - state magnetic properties of ferh clusters , we have varied systematically the value of the total spin polarization of the cluster @xmath65 by performing fixed spin - moment ( fsm ) calculations in the whole physically relevant range .",
    "let us recall that @xmath66 where @xmath67(@xmath68 ) represents the number of electrons in the majority ( minority ) states .",
    "in practice we start from the non - magnetic state ( @xmath69 ) and increase @xmath65 until the local spin moments are fully saturated , i.e. , until the fe moments in the paw sphere reach @xmath70 and the rh moments @xmath71 ( typically , @xmath72 ) .",
    "the above described global geometry optimizations are performed independently for each value of @xmath65 .",
    "these fsm study provides a wealth of information on the isomerization energies , the spin - excitation energies , and their interplay .",
    "these are particularly interesting for a subtle magnetic alloy such as ferh , and would therefore deserve to be analyzed in some more detail . in the present paper we shall focus on the ground - state properties by determining for each considered fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 the most stable structural and magnetic configuration corresponding to energy minimum as a function of @xmath65 and of the atomic positions.@xcite",
    "once the optimization with respect to structural and magnetic degrees of freedom is achieved , we derive the binding energy per atom @xmath73/ n$ ] in the usual way by referring the total energy @xmath74 to the corresponding energy of @xmath59 fe and @xmath60 rh isolated atoms .",
    "moreover , for each stationary point of the total energy surface ( i.e. , for each relaxed structure having a nearly vanishing @xmath75 ) we determine the vibrational frequencies from the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix .",
    "the latter is calculated from finite differences of the analytic gradients of the total energy . in this way we can rule out saddle points to which the local optimization procedure happens to converge on some occasions .",
    "only configurations which correspond to true minima are discussed in the following . finally , a number of electronic and magnetic properties for example , the magnetic energy @xmath76 , the local magnetic moments @xmath77 integrated within the wigner - seitz ( ws ) or bader atomic cells of atom @xmath44,@xcite and the spin polarized density of electronic states ( dos ) @xmath78 are derived from the self - consistent spin - polarized density and kohn - sham spectrum .",
    "[ sec:2 ] in this section we discuss the ground - state structure , chemical order , binding energy , and magnetic moments of fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 clusters having @xmath79 atoms .",
    "the main emphasis is here on understanding how the various electronic , structural and magnetic properties depend on the chemical composition of the alloy .",
    "first , each cluster size @xmath80 is analyzed separately , since a strong dependence on @xmath80 is expected in the small size , non - scalable regime .",

    "remarkably , the rh local moments in rh@xmath114 are the largest among all the heptamers",

    "also in rh@xmath110 one finds quite large local moments , which are actually larger than the rh moments in most fe doped clusters .",
    "this shows that for these sizes the fe atoms do not necessarily increase the rh moments by simple proximity effects ( see tables [ tab:7 ] and [ tab:8 ] ) .",

    "the local fe moments are strongly enhanced with respect to pure fe@xmath9 ( @xmath128 in fe@xmath114 or fe@xmath110 ) reaching values up to @xmath129 , particularly when the fe atoms are in a rh rich environment .",
    "as in the smaller clusters , this is a consequence of a charge transfer from the fe to the rh atoms , which increases the number of polarizable fe @xmath7-holes . notice that some kind of interaction between the fe atoms seems to favor this effect , since the largest @xmath130 are found for clusters having 2 or 3 fe atoms rather than for the single fe impurity .",
    "large fe moments are also found in bulk ferh alloys.@xcite    to conclude this section it is interesting to compare the cluster results with available experiments and calculations for macroscopic alloys.@xcite band structure calculations for the periodic fe@xmath131rh@xmath131 alloy having a cscl structure yield an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state , which is more stable than the ferromagnetic solution.@xcite this is qualitatively in agreement with experiments showing af order when the rh concentration is above or equal to 50%.@xcite in contrast our results for small clusters show a fm - like order for all rh concentrations , even for the pure rh clusters .",
    "this is a consequence of the reduction of local coordination number and the associated effective @xmath7-band narrowing , which renders the stoner criterion far easier to satisfy , and which tends to stabilize the high - spin states with respect to the low - spin af states .",

    "hexamers the energy differences between the low - lying isomers are more important and only in one case , fe@xmath160rh@xmath81 , magnetism appears to be crucial for stabilizing the actual optimal structure . a similar strong interplay between structure , chemical order and magnetism is expected for larger ferh clusters .",
    "in the previous sections the structure and spin moments of ferh alloy clusters have been discussed as a function of 3@xmath7/4@xmath7 concentration . although these properties are intimately related to the size and composition dependence of electronic structure , it is in general very difficult to achieve a physical transparent correlation between global and microscopic behaviors .",
    "nevertheless , it is very interesting to analyze , at least for some representative examples , how the electronic structure depends on the composition of magnetic nanoalloys .",
    "to this aim we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] the spin - polarized @xmath7-electron density of states ( dos ) of representative ferh octamers having the relaxed structures illustrated in table  [ tab:8 ] .",
    "results for pure fe@xmath110 and rh@xmath110 are also shown for the sake of comparison .",
    "in all the clusters , the dominant peaks in the relevant energy range near @xmath161 correspond either to the fe-@xmath10 or to the rh-@xmath11 states .",
    "the valence spectrum is largely dominated by these @xmath7-electron contributions .",
    "in fact the total dos and the @xmath7-projected dos are difficult to tell apart .",
    "first of all , let us consider the dos of the pure clusters .",
    "our results for rh@xmath110 with a cube structure are similar to those of previous studies.@xcite they show the dominant @xmath7-electron contribution near @xmath161 , with the characteristic ferromagnetic exchange splitting between the minority and majority spin states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we also included the dos for rh@xmath110 with a bco structure , since it allows us to illustrate the differences in the electronic structure of compact and open geometries .",
    "moreover , the dos of pure rh@xmath110 with bco structure is very useful in order to demonstrate the dependence of dos on fe content , since the structures of fe@xmath57rh@xmath115 with @xmath162 are similar to the bco .",
    "both fe@xmath110 and rh@xmath110 show relatively narrow @xmath7-bands which dominate the single - particle energy spectrum in the range @xmath163 .",
    "the spin polarization of the dos clearly reflects the ferromagnetic order in the cluster .",
    "putting aside the exchange splitting , the peak structure in the up and down dos @xmath164 are comparable .",
    "there are even qualitative similarities between the two elements . however , looking in more detail , one observes that the effective @xmath7-band width in fe@xmath110 ( about 4  ev ) is somewhat smaller than in rh@xmath110 ( about 5  ev ) . moreover , in rh@xmath110 the dos at @xmath161 is non - vanishing for both spin directions and the finite - size gaps are very small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dos ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the majority @xmath7-dos is fully occupied in fe@xmath110 , with the highest majority state lying about 0.5  ev below @xmath161 . in addition",
    "there is an appreciable gap ( about 0.1  ev ) in the corresponding minority spectrum .",
    "these qualitative differences are of course consistent with the fact that fe@xmath110 is a strong ferromagnet with saturated moments , while rh@xmath110 should be regarded as a weak unsaturated ferromagnet .",
    "the trends as a function of concentration reflect the crossover between the previous contrasting behaviors . for low fe concentration ( e.g. , fe@xmath81rh@xmath123 )",
    "we still find states with both spin directions close to @xmath161 .",
    "the magnetic moments are not saturated , although the fermi energy tends to approach the top of the majority band .",
    "moreover , the majority - spin states close to @xmath161 have dominantly rh character .",
    "small fe doping does not reduce the @xmath7-band width significantly . notice the rather important change in the shape of the dos in fe@xmath81rh@xmath123 as compared to the dos in rh@xmath110 .",
    "this is a consequence of the change in topology from cubic to bicapped octahedron ( bco ) .    for equal concentrations ( fe@xmath160rh@xmath160 ) the first signs of @xmath7-band narrowing and enhanced exchange splitting start to become apparent .",
    "the spin - up states ( majority band ) which in fe@xmath81rh@xmath123 contribute to the dos at @xmath161 now move to lower energies ( 0.3 ev below @xmath161 ) so that the majority band is saturated .",
    "only spin - down ( minority ) states are found around @xmath161 , although there is a significant gap in @xmath165 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) . in the majority band rh dominates over fe at the higher energies ( closer to @xmath161 ) , while fe dominates in the bottom of the band . in the minority band",
    "the participation of rh ( fe ) is stronger ( weaker ) below @xmath161 and weaker ( stronger ) above @xmath161 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the rh local moments are smaller than the fe moments .",
    "finally , in the fe rich limit ( e.g. , fe@xmath123rh@xmath81 ) , the majority - band width becomes as narrow as in fe@xmath110 , while the minority band is still comparable to rh@xmath110 .",
    "the exchange splitting is large , the majority band saturated and only minority states are found close to @xmath161 . as in fe@xmath110 , @xmath165 shows a clear gap at @xmath161 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "however , the rh contribution to the minority states below @xmath161 remains above average despite the relative small rh content .",
    "the fe contribution largely dominates the unoccupied minority - spin dos , in agreement with the larger local fe moments .",
    "the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of small fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 clusters having @xmath166 atoms have been investigated systematically in the framework of a generalized gradient approximation to density - functional theory .",
    "for very small sizes ( @xmath50 atoms ) the binding energy @xmath89 shows a non - monotonous dependence on concentration , which implies that the ferh bonds are stronger than the homogeneous ones .",
    "however , for larger sizes the ferh and rhrh bond strengths become comparable , so that @xmath89 depends weakly on concentration for high rh content .",
    "the magnetic order of the clusters having the most stable structures is found to be fm - like .",
    "moreover , the average magnetic moment per atom @xmath5 increases monotonously , which is almost linear over a wide range of concentration with fe content .",
    "consequently , the energy gain @xmath121 associated to magnetism also increases with the number of fe atoms .",
    "the largest part of the spin polarization ( about 90% ) can be traced back to the local @xmath7 magnetic moments within the paw sphere of the atoms .",
    "the @xmath167 and @xmath168 spin polarizations are almost negligible in general .",
    "a remarkable enhancement of the local fe moments is observed as result of rh doping .",
    "this is a consequence of the increase in the number of fe @xmath7 holes , due to charge transfer from fe to rh , combined with the extremely reduced local coordination .",
    "the rh local moments are important already in the pure clusters ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , they are not significantly enhanced by fe doping .",
    "however , the overall stability of magnetism , as measured by the total energy gained by the onset of spin polarization , is found to increase with increasing fe content .",
    "a further interesting aspect , particularly for future studies is the role of spin - orbit ( so ) interactions on the magnetism of nanoalloys .",
    "we have performed some representative calculations by taking into account spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in order to explore their effect on the ground - state structure , chemical order and spin moments .",
    "for example in fe@xmath123 , fe@xmath118rh@xmath118 and rh@xmath123 we find that the changes in the ground - state energy resulting from so interaction are typically of the order of 0.2 ev for the whole cluster .",
    "this is often comparable to or larger than the energy differences between the low - lying isomers .",
    "the so energies are very similar for different structures , so that the ground - state structures remain essentially the same as in the scalar relativistic ( sr ) calculations . the changes in the bond lengths and in the spin moments resulting from soc are also very small ( e.g. , @xmath169 0.01@xmath6 and @xmath170 0.001 in fe@xmath118rh@xmath118 ) . as a result ,",
    "the conclusions drawn from our sr calculations on the relative stability and local spin moments seem to be unaffected by the spin - orbit contributions .",
    "ferh clusters are expected to develop a variety of further interesting behaviors , which still remain to be explored .",
    "for instance , larger cluster should show a more complex dependence of the magnetic order as a function of concentration .",
    "in particular for large rh content one should observe a transition from fm - like to af - like order with increasing cluster size , in agreement with the af phase found in solids for more than 50% rh concentration .",
    "moreover , the metamagnetic transition observed in bulk ferh alloys also puts forward the possibility of similar interesting phenomena in nanoalloys as a function of temperature .",
    "finally , the contributions of orbital magnetism and magnetic anisotropy deserve to be explored in detail as a function of composition and chemical order , even for the smallest sizes , particularly because of their implications for potential applications.@xcite    it is pleasure to thank dr .",

    "this yields a total energy differences of 1.75 mev and 0.25 mev , respectively . in the above calculations the changes in average bond length ( bond angle )",
    "amounts to 10@xmath172  ( 10@xmath173 degrees ) .",
