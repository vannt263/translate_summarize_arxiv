    "temporal meson correlation functions in euclidean time can be related to meson spectral functions by analytic continuation . furthermore using the maximum entropy method one can extract the spectral functions from meson correlators calculated on a finite lattice @xcite .",
    "the method was applied at zero @xcite as well as non - zero temperature @xcite . in such an analysis one",
    "usually uses all time slices in the correlation function not just the long distance part .",
    "therefore one is sensitive to short distance physics which may be affected by lattice artifacts .",
    "the lattice distortion of the correlators at short distances translates into lattice artifacts in the spectral functions for large energies .",
    "so far only wilson gauge action and wilson ( clover ) fermion action have been used to study meson spectral functions .",
    "the lattice artifacts seen in numerical simulations for this combination of actions turns out to be quite different from what is expected in the free theory @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study cutoff effects of meson spectral functions using different gauge and fermion actions .",
    "we consider the temporal correlators of meson currents @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 for pseudo - scalar and vector channels . for temperature",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=230 ]    although this relation is valid _ a priori _ only in the continuum , it has been shown recently that in the limit of a non - interacting theory it holds on the lattice @xcite as well .",
    "we use quenched domain wall fermon correlators on dbw2 gauge configurations from the rbc collaboration .",
    "furthermore , we calculate tree - level clover fermion correlators on quenched 1-loop tadpole - improved symanzik lattices and on partially - quenched 2 + 1 flavor asqtad fermion lattices from the milc collaboration .    to extract the spectral function we use the maximum entropy method .",
    "we also parametrize the spectral functions as a sum of delta functions @xmath6 and determine the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 using constrained curve fitting techniques@xcite which allows for better systematic control of the results .",
    "we start the discussion of our numerical results with the case of domain wall fermions .",
    "here we performed calculations at three different lattice spacings , @xmath9 gev and valance quark mass around the strange quark mass .",
    "for the coarsest lattice we see a two peak structure in the spectral functions with the second peak located around 2gev .",
    "the positions of the peaks are reasonably reproduced using a two exponential fit . in fig .",
    "[ dwf2.0_fig ] we show our results for finer lattices , @xmath10 gev for the pseudo - scalar and vector spectral functions .",
    "we see a three peak structure , with the first excited state being close to the position of the physical excited states of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "the third peak is likely to be a lattice artifact .",
    "we also performed a simple two exponential fit of the corresponding meson correlators .",
    "the results of the fit are shown as the vertical line and as a band .",
    "the ground state mass from the fit ( statisitcal error @xmath13% not shown ) is in reasonable agreement with the mem analysis while for first excited state there is larger statistical uncertainty indicated by the band . to see whether or not the second and third peak correspond to physical resonances or lattice artifacts , we calculated the spectral functions at @xmath14 gev .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ dwf3.0_fig ] which shows that the ground state peak did not shift ( apart from a small shift due to slightly larger quark mass ) while the second and the third peaks have moved roughly as @xmath15 .",
    "this indicates that these peaks are lattice artifacts .",
    "similar results were found for the wilson action @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite they were interpreted as bound states of wilson doublers . for dwf , however , such an interpretation is more difficuilt to apply . for this lattice spacing",
    "we have also performed a constrained fit with three exponentials .",
    "the ground state mass shown as the vertical line in fig .",
    "[ dwf3.0_fig ] was obtained from a simple uncostrained fit which was then used as a prior for the constrained fit .",

    "absent dynamical quarks , all hadrons are absolutely stable ( i.e. have zero width ) no matter how large their mass is .",
    "if dynamical quarks are present , hadrons may decay , and the higher the mass the larger the width .",
    "therefore higher lying resonances merge into a continuum . to check this we performed calculations in quenched and partially - quenched qcd using the clover action .",
    "more precisely we used gauge configurations with symanzik action generated by the milc collaboration as well the dynamical 2 + 1 asqtad configurations . in both cases",
    "the lattice spacing was @xmath16 .",
    "we use the tree - level value for the clover coefficient , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 which corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "results for the spectral functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ wilson_fig ] .",
    "as one can see , the spectral functions for quenched and partially quenched qcd are very similar , indicating that for quark masses around the strange quark mass effects due to quenching are quite small .",
    "in addition we have also calculated meson spectral functions wit hyp smeared clover action in @xmath20 partially - quenched qcd , i.e. we have applied hyp smearing on the dynamical configuations before calculating the meson correlators .",
    "we have performed calculations at several quark masses . from extrapolation of",
    "the pseudo - scalar mass squared to zero we determine the critical hopping parameter to be @xmath21 ( statistical error only ) .",
    "the purpose of calculation with hyp smearing was to see whether the smoothing of the gauge fields removes the artificial peaks , and the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ wilson_fig ] .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the lattice artifacts are reduced but not removed completely by hyp smearing . however , as a by - product we observe that number of exceptional configurations as well as the number of cg in the fermions matrix inversions are greatly reduced . in fact",
    "we did not observe any exceptional configurations in a sample of 59 configurations down to quark masses @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the strange quark mass ) .",
