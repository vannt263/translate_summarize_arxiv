    "the ising model @xcite is commonly used as a benchmark to test and improve new algorithms and methods for computer simulation in models of statistical mechanics .",
    "for instance , monte carlo methods such as metropolis @xcite , swendsen - wang @xcite , wang - landau @xcite , single histogram @xcite and broad histogram @xcite have all been used to calculate the critical exponents of this model .",
    "the ising model has also been employed to study social behavior and many of these models and others can be found out in @xcite .",
    "g. grinstein _",
    "@xcite have argued that non - equilibrium stochastic spin systems on regular square lattices ( sl ) with up - down symmetry , fall into the same universality class of the equilibrium ising model .",
    "the correspondence was observed for several models that do not obey detailed balance and on other regular lattices @xcite .",
    "the majority - vote model with two states ( mv2 ) is a non - equilibrium model proposed by m.j .",
    "oliveira in @xmath9 which does not obey detailed balance .",
    "this model follows a stochastic dynamics with local rules and with up - down symmetry , and on a regular lattice shows a second - order phase transition with critical exponents @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 consistent @xcite with those of the equilibrium ising model @xcite . however , lima _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have studied mv2 on voronoi - delaunay random lattices with periodic boundary conditions , and they obtained exponents different from those obtained on regular lattices , in disagreement with the conjecture suggested by g. grinstein _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "simulations on both _ undirected _ and _ directed _ scale - free networks @xcite , random graphs @xcite and social networks @xcite , have attracted interest of researchers from various areas .",
    "these complex networks have been studied extensively by lima _",
    "_ in the context of discrete models ( mv2 , ising , and potts model ) @xcite .",
    "recently , the equilibrium ising model was studied on a class of hierarchical scale - free networks , namely the apollonian networks ( ans ) @xcite , and it was shown that , on these networks , no phase transition is observed for these models .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the mv2 model on normal and redirected ans . by means of numerical simulations we found that mv2 model in ans",
    "network displays a clear second - order phase transition .",
    "this demonstrates that , on these networks , mv2 and the ising model do not fall in the same universality class , therefore contradicting grinstein hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the remainder of our paper , is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present our model and some details about the monte carlo simulation as well as the calculations performed in the evolution of the physical quantities . in section 3 , we do an analysis over the simulations performed and discuss the obtained results .",
    "finally in section 4 , we present our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "our network is ans type composed of @xmath13 nodes , where @xmath14 is the generation number @xcite . to introduce a level of disorder",
    "we redirect a faction @xmath2 of the of the links .",
    "the redirecting results in a directed network , preserving the out - going node of the redirected link but changing the incoming node . in the limit of @xmath15 we have the apollonian networks , while in the limit @xmath16 we have something similar to random networks @xcite .",
    "note however , that the number of outgoing links of each node is preserved , therefore , even in the limit @xmath16 the network still have hubs that that are the most influent nodes .",
    "for @xmath15 we have the standard apollonian networks .",
    "these networks display a scale free degree distribution and a hierarchical structure .",
    "the critical properties of percolation and potts models on these networks have been investigated @xcite and its was shown that in the thermodynamic limit there is no phase transition , with the ordered phase prevailing for any finite temperature .    on the mv2 model , the system dynamics is as follows .",
    "initially , we assign a spin variable @xmath17 with values @xmath18 at each node of the network . at each step",
    "we try to spin flip a node .",
    "the flip is accepted with probability @xmath19 , \\label{eq_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the sign @xmath18 of @xmath21 if @xmath22 , @xmath23 if @xmath24 . to calculate @xmath25 our sum runs over the number @xmath26 of nearest neighbors of @xmath27-th spin .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) means that with probability @xmath28 the spin will adopt the same state as the majority of its neighbors . here",
    ", the control parameter @xmath29 plays a role similar to the temperature in equilibrium systems , the smaller @xmath1 greater the probability of parallel aligning with the local majority .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulation on the ans with various systems of size @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we wait @xmath35 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) in order to reach the steady state , and then the time averages are estimated over the next @xmath36 mcs .",
    "one mcs is accomplished after all the @xmath37 spins are investigated whether they flip or not .",
    "we carried out @xmath38 to @xmath39 independent simulation runs for each lattice and for a given set of parameters @xmath40 . to study the critical behavior of the model we define the variable @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the magnetization @xmath42 , susceptibility @xmath43 and the reduced fourth - order cumulant @xmath44 @xmath45_{av } , \\label{eq_2}\\ ] ] @xmath46_{av } , \\label{eq_3}\\ ] ] @xmath47_{av } , \\label{eq_4}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 stands for a thermodynamics average .",
    "the results are averaged over the @xmath49 ( av ) ans independent simulations .",
    "these quantities are functions of the noise parameter @xmath1 and obey the finite - size scaling relations @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the usual critical exponents , @xmath53 are the finite size scaling functions with @xmath54 being the scaling variable . from this scaling relations we obtained the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively . moreover , the value of @xmath55 for which @xmath43 has a maximum is expected to scale with the system size as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
