    "one - dimensional solitons , when viewed in two spatial dimensions , become line solitons which are uniform along the line direction ( called transverse direction ) .",

    "it was shown numerically in @xcite that when a one- or two - dimensional periodic potential is included in the continuous nls equation , this transverse instability can be completely eliminated if the line soliton bifurcates from certain symmetry points of the dispersion surface .",
    "but in the corresponding discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equations , discrete line solitons in one - dimensional lattices are numerically found to be still transversely unstable @xcite , highlighting the difference between continuous and discrete nls models .    in this article",
    ", we analytically investigate transverse stability of line solitons in the dnls equations on two - dimensional ( square ) and one - dimensional ( stripe ) lattices .",

    "these results hold for both focusing and defocusing dnls equations via a staggering transformation . for unstable line solitons ,",
    "their unstable eigenvalues are also derived asymptotically .",
    "we also investigate the transverse stability of line solitons numerically both near the anti - continuum limit and away from it . near the anti - continuum limit , the numerical results fully agree with the analytical results . away from the anti - continuum limit ,",
    "we reveal additional bifurcations of unstable eigenvalues which can not be captured by the theoretical analysis .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2d ] , we consider the transverse stability of discrete line solitons on a two - dimensional lattice . we show that the entire solution family bifurcating from the @xmath1 point is transversely unstable , whereas the solution family bifurcating from the @xmath0 point is transversely stable in the anti - continuum limit . in section [ sec:1d ] , we consider the transverse stability of discrete line solitons on a one - dimensional lattice , and show that they are always unstable . numerical results and their comparison with the theory are reported in section [ sec : num ] .",
