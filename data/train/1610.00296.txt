    "the kuramoto model has been used to study the dynamics of synchronization in a wide variety of physical , chemical , and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "the model s governing equations can be written ( unconventionally , but most usefully for our purposes ) in the following dimensionless form : @xmath0 for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the phase of oscillator @xmath3 , and the sum is over all of @xmath3 s neighbors @xmath4 , as determined by the coupling graph . by rescaling time in eq .  , we have normalized the coupling strength to unity without loss of generality .",
    "the term @xmath5 can then be interpreted as the scaled natural frequency of oscillator @xmath3 .",
    "the motivation for this unusual notation is that we are going to regard @xmath6 as a fixed frequency vector and @xmath7 as an adjustable parameter controlling the spread of the natural frequencies .",
    "for instance , the components of @xmath8 could be chosen independently at random from a prescribed probability distribution .",
    "then increasing @xmath9 would allow us to increase the  width \" of the set of frequencies @xmath10 .",
    "we will occasionally write @xmath11 for brevity",
    ".    in the simple case where @xmath12 and all the oscillators have @xmath13 , the model has a stable fixed state with @xmath14 for all @xmath3 , for a broad class of coupling graphs .",
    "now imagine increasing @xmath9 slightly to produce some variation among the @xmath15 . starting from an initial condition @xmath16 and assuming a sufficiently small but nonzero @xmath9 , the system will asymptotically approach a stable periodic solution of eq .",
    "in which all the oscillators run at the same constant frequency @xmath17 for all @xmath3 , for some constant @xmath18 .",
    "we call such a solution a stable phase - locked state .",
    "but when @xmath9 gets too large , the natural frequencies @xmath19 will become too disparate for the coupling to lock the oscillators to a common @xmath18 .",
    "so as @xmath9 increases , we eventually lack any stable phase - locked solution .",
    "this desynchronization transition occurs at what we call the _ locking threshold _",
    ", at a parameter value given by the _ critical value _ of @xmath9 ( alternatively , the critical width ) .",
    "its calculation has been a focus of many prior studies of the kuramoto model . among these ,",
    "a major point of variation has come from the choice of coupling topologies .",
    "the manner in which the oscillators are connected can have drastic effects on the behavior of the critical @xmath9 , as has been demonstrated in work on complete graphs , one - dimensional chains and rings , two - dimensional square grids , three - dimensional cubic lattices , @xmath20-dimensional hypercubic lattices , random graphs , small - world and scale - free networks , and so on .",
    "for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a tractable situation where the dependence of the critical @xmath9 on topology , as opposed to dimension , can be well characterized .",
    "namely , if we have a one - dimensional lattice of oscillators with nearest - neighbor coupling , how does the critical @xmath9 depend on the choice of boundary condition ?",
    "if oscillators 1 and @xmath21 are coupled , we call this the _ ring _ topology and denote its locking threshold by @xmath22 . alternatively , if oscillators 1 and @xmath21 are not connected , we call this the _ chain _ topology and write its corresponding locking threshold as @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively , one might expect a ring and a chain to have similar locking thresholds , especially when @xmath21 becomes large .",
    "after all , the two topologies differ only by a single edge . on the other hand ,",
    "that single edge is responsible for a topological ( and hence _ qualitative _ , not merely quantitative ) change in the lattice s connectivity structure .",
    "for that reason it could conceivably have a very potent effect .",
    "although the setting of one - dimensional lattices may seem overly simplistic , it has the advantage that both rings and chains of oscillators have been studied extensively , using various techniques to analyze their dynamics and bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the main question is this : if we have a chain and a ring subject to the same initial condition @xmath16 and the same vector of base frequencies @xmath24 , what limits can be placed on the ratio @xmath25 ?",
    "in particular , must a ring always be `` more stable '' than a chain , leading to @xmath26 ?",
    "in addition to variation in the connectivity structure , another source of variation in kuramoto - like systems comes from altering the coupling function .",
    "for instance , we could replace the pure sine function in eq .   with a more general periodic function .",
    "as we will see , the following analysis allows for such a generalization , though at the cost of introducing a different type of special structure .    to motivate this structure ,",
    "let us look at the governing equation for an internal oscillator @xmath3 ( meaning an oscillator with @xmath27 ) in a one - dimensional kuramoto chain or ring : @xmath28 because sine is odd , eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath29 so if we want to generalize from sine to a more general function @xmath30 , mathematically speaking we have two plausible choices : either @xmath31 or @xmath32    equation   is a generalization of the kuramoto model that has often been studied in the past , motivated by its physical and biological applications  @xcite .",
    "however , we believe it is instructive to consider the alternative eq .   as well , and will devote most of our attention to it below . where the distinction becomes important",
    ", we will say eq .   represents _ standard coupling _ , and eq",
    ".   represents _ telescopic coupling _ , thanks to some convenient cancellation properties it enjoys .",
    "we will restrict attention to continuously differentiable coupling functions @xmath30 that are @xmath33-periodic , and will also demand that @xmath30 is nonconstant and has at least one zero .",
    "although telescopic coupling is unconventional , it coincides with standard coupling when @xmath30 is an odd function , as commonly assumed in the physics literature . in that sense ,",
    "telescopic and standard coupling schemes are on equal footing as generalizations of kuramoto s sinusoidal coupling . actually , considering the vast literature that focuses on pure sine coupling , even that special case remains of interest . our results for telescopic coupling will include the traditional sine case while extending it to a new and wider family of models .",
    "one possible objection is that telescopic coupling injects a directionality to a chain or ring . to see this , note that swapping the oscillators and natural frequencies `` left to right '' ( @xmath34 for @xmath35 ) changes the governing equations for telescopic coupling , but not for standard coupling .",
    "but such a directionality may be reasonable in some contexts .",
    "for example , there are a number of physical and biological systems which have been modeled as directed chains of oscillators , such as central pattern generators for the swimming rhythm of lamprey  @xcite .",
    "a related point in favor of telescopic coupling is that it eases the analysis of oscillator arrays whose coupling functions @xmath30 lack odd symmetry .",
    "although some results have been obtained for non - odd coupling on a chain  @xcite , these are rare .",
    "much of the existing research in this field has relied on the oddness of the coupling function and struggled otherwise . as we will see , telescopic coupling handles non - odd functions without difficulty .",
    "to begin the analysis , we calculate the critical width @xmath23 above which the chain has no phase - locked solutions @xcite . after including the chain boundary terms , and assuming telescopic coupling as in eq .",
    ", the dynamics are given by @xmath36 by definition , for @xmath37 , the system evolves to a stable locked state , and conversely , locking is impossible for @xmath38 .",
    "so if we find a condition on the existence of a locked state , we get a condition on @xmath23 .",
    "recall that locking occurs when @xmath17 for all @xmath3 , for some @xmath18 .",
    "if we simply sum all @xmath21 of the differential equations above and then divide by @xmath21 , we find @xmath39 where we took advantage of telescoping nature of telescopic coupling .",
    "let @xmath40 this allows us to rewrite our condition for locking as @xmath41 sum the first @xmath3 equations and telescope them to obtain @xmath42 let us define @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "this yields @xmath46 which is an exact condition on finding a locked state in the chain topology .",
    "in particular this means that @xmath23 corresponds to the supremum of all @xmath9 s where the above equation is satisfied and the solution @xmath47 is stable .",
    "this condition is equivalent to one found previously for sine coupling  @xcite .",
    "next we check that condition is satisfiable for the class of @xmath30 under consideration .",
    "our biggest demand on @xmath30 was that it be continuously differentiable and periodic .",
    "continuous periodic real - valued functions are bounded and attain their maximum and minimum , so we know that both @xmath30 and @xmath48 attain their upper and lower bounds .",
    "let us define the bounds @xmath49 and @xmath50 we also requested that @xmath30 be non - constant and cross zero , so @xmath51    given a particular realization of @xmath52 s , we can define @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "so @xmath55 represents the largest positive value of @xmath56 if it exists and 0 otherwise , with @xmath57 similarly defined for negative values , enforcing @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we know that all locked states disappear at a critical point of @xmath59 we formally take @xmath60 ; notice that @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 for all @xmath3 , which is only possible if all the @xmath52 are identical . also note that since @xmath63 and @xmath64 represent global bounds on @xmath30 , then no equilibrium _ at all _ can exist when @xmath65 however , for @xmath66 we can always find a set of @xmath67 that will satisfy the prior equations .",
    "this makes @xmath23 the true point between a locked state existing and disappearing .",
    "however , knowing a phase - locked state exists does not ensure it is stable .",
    "fortunately , it is not hard to show if @xmath68 , then a stable locked state exists . for any @xmath69 there",
    "exists some point @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; otherwise @xmath30 could never climb from @xmath73 to @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath48 is bounded , there are only finitely many @xmath70 which could work for each @xmath73 in the bounded domain @xmath74 $ ] . and",
    "since @xmath48 is continuous , then @xmath48 will be positive in a neighborhood of @xmath70 , so our point selection can take advantage of this .",
    "ergo there exists some open set @xmath75 where @xmath30 restricted to @xmath75 always has positive derivative and is surjective onto @xmath76 for a visual example , see fig .",
    "[ lambdaplot ] .    returning to our original question ,",
    "if @xmath77 we can select a set of @xmath67 out of @xmath75 in a well - defined way , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "a theorem of ermentrout  @xcite then guarantees that such a solution is asymptotically stable .",
    "therefore , eq",
    ".   really does define @xmath23 , below which at least one stable locked state exists and above which none do .",
    "the next step is to obtain an upper bound on @xmath22 , the locking threshold for a ring .",
    "although the interior of a chain looks the same as a ring , they differ at the boundary terms , as seen in the following equations : @xmath80 nevertheless , several steps in the following argument will be the same as for the chain .",
    "for example , locked states still satisfy @xmath81 for some @xmath18 , and we can still telescope the equations , yielding @xmath82 again .",
    "similarly , @xmath83 which can be telescoped into @xmath84 here , @xmath56 and @xmath67 are defined exactly as in the last section .",
    "hence , if we put the same choice of @xmath8 s on a ring and a chain , they would have the same vectors @xmath85 .",
    "also notice that @xmath86 therefore , we can write @xmath87    equations like this have been found before for the special case of sine coupling  @xcite .",
    "although eq .   has a compact form , demonstrating that solutions to it exist and calculating them explicitly is a difficult endeavor ; hence our more modest goal is to establish a bound on @xmath22 .",
    "let us define @xmath88 , and @xmath57 as before .",
    "since @xmath89 represent global extrema , the ring can have a locked state only if @xmath90 for all @xmath3 .",
    "this yields @xmath91 because we have been careful to use the same @xmath56 here as in the chain case , eq .   can be directly compared to eq .   to give the bound @xmath92",
    "if @xmath93 , then we have that @xmath94 if otherwise @xmath95 , then @xmath96 together these facts imply @xmath97    thus we have found a rigorous upper bound on the `` advantage '' of a ring over a chain , with the bound depending exclusively on the shape of the coupling function @xmath30 . also notice that the arguments of the @xmath98 function are a nonnegative real number and its reciprocal , so this upper bound is always at least 2 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath30 is odd and @xmath99 then @xmath100 so eq .   is tight in certain cases . we will discuss the linear stability of states on the ring later , but since we need a solution to exist before it can be stable , the bound is valid .",
    "now that we have the upper bound on the ratio of the critical widths , it is natural to want to check how sharp it is . the results shown in fig .  [ wedgeplot ]",
    "do exactly that .",
    "we generate many different realizations of the base frequency vectors @xmath8 , and then plot the numerically obtained @xmath23 and @xmath22 on a scatterplot , and draw a solid line to denote our predicted boundary .",
    "we first test an odd coupling function , namely sine ; then we test several non - odd coupling functions . for the regimes being tested , a lot of points congregate at our upper bound , but as expected , none actually trespass it .",
    "but what about the lower dashed line representing @xmath101 ?",
    "it is tempting to think that this line should also be respected ; after all , a ring has an additional coupling connection , and it has no free ends . with this extra edge to provide more coupling between the oscillators , one intuitively expects that a ring should always lock more easily than a chain .",
    "moreover , the difference in boundary conditions means that the ring permits topologically twisted states  @xcite that would be impossible for the chain .",
    "this too would naively suggest that the ring is always more susceptible to locking than the chain is",
    ".    however , fig .",
    "[ wedgeplot ] indicates that some cases lie below the dashed line . in such cases",
    "the chain locks when its matched ring does not .",
    "apparently the naive intuition above is wrong .",
    "we now confirm this surprising result by constructing a counterexample .",
    "in fact , the critical width of a chain is _ not _ always less than that of a matched ring . here is a counterexample .",
    "say we have @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and we have obtained a realization of @xmath8 s such that @xmath105 .",
    ".   immediately implies that @xmath106 , and we can satisfy this system with @xmath107 .",
    "now consider what the corresponding locked state would be for the ring .",
    "by assumption , such a state must exist ; if @xmath102 is true , we should be able to produce a locked solution to the ring equations   with @xmath108 .",
    "such a solution would then satisfy the following system : @xmath109 notice that if we subtract the second or third equation from the first , we get @xmath110    from here , we realize we have no choice . it must be that @xmath111 and @xmath112 which yields the desired contradiction , since it gives @xmath113 which violates eq .",
    "( 14 ) .",
    "the contradiction shows that even though we have a locked state for a chain , none exists for the ring .",
    "so sometimes @xmath114 .",
    "because this counterexample uses the sine function , it works for both the standard and telescopic coupling models .",
    "unfortunately , trying to come up with a genuine lower bound for @xmath25 is surprisingly involved , given that such shenanigans can be found in the small-@xmath21 cases .",
    "although small @xmath21 is problematic , the large-@xmath21 regime is more tractable",
    ". let us fix @xmath21 to be large but finite , and choose some realization of @xmath8 .",
    "if we start with @xmath68 , we are guaranteed a phase - locked solution @xmath115 to the chain equation , satisfying @xmath116 for all @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , we are guaranteed to be able to choose these @xmath67 from the set @xmath75 as defined earlier .",
    "we seek to construct an approximate phase - locked solution to the ring based on this chain solution .",
    "the coupling function @xmath30 is @xmath33-periodic , so let us define @xmath118 thus @xmath119 . since we insisted that @xmath30 cross zero and be both nonconstant and periodic , there exists some point @xmath120 $ ] such that @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ". we can then define @xmath123 as a value close to @xmath124 .",
    "this will represent our attempted solution to the ring equation .    first notice that @xmath125 and so we find    @xmath126    but recall that @xmath30 is continuously differentiable , so there is some finite upper bound on the derivative @xmath127 . in other words , for any @xmath70 and @xmath128 , then @xmath129 therefore , @xmath130 which implies @xmath131 so @xmath132 is an approximate solution to the ring equations that becomes exact as @xmath21 approaches infinity .",
    "figure  [ normplot ] shows the convergence of this approximate solution for the ring to that for the chain .",
    "we numerically construct pairs of solutions that get closer as @xmath21 gets large .",
    "this all makes sense , since an infinitely long chain should be identical to an infinitely long ring .    concerning stability",
    ", remember that the set @xmath75 is open , so for any @xmath133 , then for sufficiently small @xmath128 then @xmath134 . so this ring solution @xmath132 also lies entirely in @xmath75 for large enough @xmath21 .",
    "this is almost enough to cite ermentrout and establish the stability of this solution  @xcite .",
    "however , we have an additional phase difference in our dynamics , @xmath135 in our proposed solution this quantity is sent to @xmath136 , which by construction has @xmath137 , and so stability is secured .    to summarize ,",
    "if we have a stable locked solution to the chain of oscillators for large @xmath21 , then there is a nearby stable locked solution for the ring of oscillators .",
    "hence , the naive lower bound @xmath138 is valid in the asymptotic case @xmath139 .",
    "our prior argument relied very little on telescopic coupling .",
    "in fact , we can use a similar method to show an equivalent result using the standard coupling   instead of telescopic coupling  .",
    "however , this requires the additional constraint of @xmath140 or @xmath141 ( where @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) .    to derive the relevant results ,",
    "suppose that we have some set of @xmath142 which satisfy the standard coupling equations for the chain and are locked at @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath143 using the fact that @xmath144 , the condition for locking on a ring becomes @xmath145 if we try plugging in @xmath146 , with @xmath147 defined the same as before , then the sum terms will evaluate to @xmath148 modulo @xmath33 .",
    "if we use the continuity arguments from before for @xmath149 , then @xmath150 for @xmath151 , then @xmath152 and for @xmath153 , then @xmath154 hence , as @xmath155 this solution becomes exact .",
    "the reason we restricted @xmath148 was because we wanted @xmath156 , which was only guaranteed if @xmath157 mod @xmath33 .    by periodicity and continuity ,",
    "if @xmath158 , then there is always some @xmath159 such that @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "so without loss of generality , if we had a chain solution @xmath162 , we could pick another solution where all the phase differences have positive slope in @xmath30 . and for sufficiently large @xmath21 , the same would hold true for the ring , since we are perturbing only slightly and we already assumed @xmath163 for the boundary term .",
    "therefore , given any existing locked solution for the chain with standard coupling ( even an unstable solution ) , this argument guarantees the existence of a _",
    "stable _ locked solution for the chain and a stable approximate solution for the ring , also with standard coupling .",
    "this means the large-@xmath21 limit gives @xmath138 for standard coupling , just as it did for telescopic coupling .",
    "but unlike the more convenient case of telescopic coupling , we can no longer construct a locked solution in the first place nor can we put clean upper bounds on @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "our main results have put a limit on the relative behavioral difference between a ring and a chain of phase oscillators . as noted in the introduction , it is generically hard to predict the conditions on synchronization .",
    "as we have shown , even a single additional connection can cause a _ doubling _ of the locking threshold , emphasizing its sensitivity to topology .",
    "however , simply putting limits on the synchronization criterion is often good enough for practical purposes .",
    "this is especially true for our particular comparison , since an analytic criterion is exactly known for a chain , but no equivalent has been demonstrated for a ring .",
    "our analysis was facilitated by the introduction of the telescopic coupling scheme .",
    "thanks to its convenient analytic properties , a large collection of different results which typically require sine , odd , or some other heavily restricted coupling function have been generalized to a new family of @xmath30 s . and as we noted earlier , telescopic coupling and standard coupling have equally legitimate mathematical claims to being a generalization of the sine - based kuramoto model .",
    "moreover , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ modelschematic ] , these two coupling schemes exactly overlap in the case of odd @xmath30 .    regarding future directions , one possibility is to ask whether the results generalize to higher dimensions .",
    "telescopic coupling introduces a directionality to a one - dimensional chain .",
    "the natural extension to higher - dimensional lattices would be to introduce a directionality along each axis .",
    "it is not hard to do such a thing , and when we do , we extend the same cancellation properties enjoyed by odd @xmath30 to generic @xmath30 . what results might come of this ?",
    "although we distinguished between the two coupling schemes and , we have not made much effort to connect their behaviors for @xmath30 non - odd .",
    "but hints of a connection are present .",
    "for example , the two plots on the right side of fig .  [ wedgeplot ] both seemingly obey our predictions , even though only one of them used our preferred telescopic coupling .",
    "the other came from standard coupling , about which we were unable to make comparably strong statements .",
    "unfortunately , we made little progress in computing exact relationships between the two schemes .",
    "given that the telescoping scheme is much easier to work with , any general connection could potentially shed a lot of light on the standard case .",
    "finally , the fundamental question of this paper could be generalized in an ambitious way . given a network of oscillators on a connectivity graph @xmath164 , how does the locking threshold @xmath9 change with the addition or removal of a single edge ?",
    "we chose both the graph and the edge very carefully in this paper , but some of our logic might still be relevant to this larger problem . considering the close relationship between the power grid and the kuramoto model , this question might bear on current issues of power grid resilience  @xcite .",
