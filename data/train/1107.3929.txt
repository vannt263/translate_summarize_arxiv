    "the carrier concentration in semiconductors is commonly measured using the hall effect based on the lorentz force exerted on moving charged particles in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite . in conventional finite - gap semiconductors , the low - temperature hall resistivity @xmath1 directly measures either the electron or the hole density . however , in compensated semiconductors , where electrons and holes coexist , the hall resistivity is determined by _ both _ types of carriers and , in particular , becomes zero in a fully compensated material .",

    "we show that the measured carrier concentration increases linearly with the magnetic field which is related to the degeneracy of the zero - energy ll shared equally between electrons and holes .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath29 it is worth emphasizing that we can apply the two - carrier model despite the presence of electron - hole puddles , which would result , for conventional nonrelativistic charge carriers , in spatial separation and related percolation phenomena in electron and hole regions . in the two - dimensional case , the percolation over electron puddles blocks unavoidably the transport for holes , and vice versa",
    "the case of graphene is dramatically different .",
    "the crucial point is that for graphene the borders between @xmath14 and @xmath13 regions are actually transparent , and electrons and holes transfer smoothly into each other , which is referred to as klein tunneling @xcite . at specific magic angles of incidence ( including normal incidence )",
    "the transmission probability is 100%  .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field does not destroy the klein tunneling but just shifts the magic angles @xcite .",
    "it can be assumed that tunneling from one electron puddle to the other electron puddle always remains possible even for carriers incident to an oblique angle ( the same holds for hole transport ) .",
    "thus , even under a nonuniform distribution of electron - hole puddles , we can apply our two - carrier model to graphene .",

    "since , at the cnp , half of the possible electrons states and half of the hole states are filled , respectively , we expect @xmath45 electron states and @xmath45 hole states occupied per unit area .",

    "interestingly , we only observe about 30  @xmath46 of the expected electron and hole concentration @xmath45 in our data extracted from the hall experiments .",
    "in contrast to low magnetic fields , where the qhe is not yet developped and all charge carriers can be considered as mobile , we now have to take into account localized charge carriers in the tails of the lls in the quantized regime .",
