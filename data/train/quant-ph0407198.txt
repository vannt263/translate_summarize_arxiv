    "brukner and zeilinger in a series of papers represent a new information - based interpretation of quantum mechanics which its foundation is established on the informative propositions [ 1 - 8 ] .",
    "they emphasize that information is the most fundamental notion in quantum mechanics and the other elementary concepts like randomness and entanglement are secondary in quantum mechanics , because all of these concepts can be deduced from definite rules of information .",
    "brukner and zeilinger also believe that shannon information [ 9 ] can not be considered as an adequate measure of uncertainty for quantum measurements , since it can be derived considering the classical requirements . unlike shannon s approach",
    ", they do not think about any communication channel for transmission of information ; rather their discussion concentrates on the information content of an isolated system .",
    "correspondingly , they define a measure of information which its value depends on the experimental context .",
    "yet , the _ total _ information is a major concept in their interpretation which is defined as the total knowledge that an _ experimentalist _ possesses before a complete set of mutually complementary experiments are performed [ 2 , 4 ] .",
    "in contrast to the shannon information , the _ total _ information of a quantum system is invariant under the change of a transformation from one complete set of complementary variables to another .",
    "this means that the total information does not change when one observes the quantum phenomena in different ways [ 4 ] .",
    "the new measure of information introduced by brukner and zeilinger , can be applied to describe the information content of a quantum system in various situations .",
    "the entanglement swapping procedure indicated in [ 7 ] is an example . in some way",
    ", it is used to express the necessary and sufficient conditions for violation of a bell inequality in an information - theoretical language .",
    "other authors used the measure in the context of state estimation [ 10 ] or quantum random access codes [ 11 ] .",
    "nevertheless , some critiques have also been appeared in different papers [ 12 - 16 ] .",
    "the main purpose in all these works is to show that shannon entropy is an adequate and consistent measure of information in both the classical and quantum regimes ( in the latter case , in the form of von neumann entropy ) .",
    "so , some persons believe that there is no need to define an alternative measure of information .",
    "but , these engaging criticisms do not explain why the brukner - zeilinger measure of information can not be regarded as a proper definition in quantum domain .",
    "furthermore , to the present authors knowledge , it has been remarked up to now no concrete criticism on the very conceptual basis of their interpretation .    in brukner and zeilinger s interpretation , two mutually connected themes can be identified .",
    "the first is based on this attitude that quantum systems carry finite information and that the finiteness of information is a fundamental principle in _ nature _ which is inherently irreducible .",
    "so , it is expected that anything in the quantum domain can be either extracted from or explained by the notion of information .",
    "the other theme is that any quantum event can be described by a specific definition of a measure of information .",
    "this allows one to represent the information content of a quantum system via a vector in the space of information which changes with a corresponding change of the experimental setup , but its length is conserved .",
    "this means in turn that the total information content of a quantum system is conserved and does not change under a transformation in the information space .    in this paper",
    "we are going to analyze the key issues of brukner and zeilinger s interpretation of quantum mechanics . in section 2 ,",
    "the basic elements of their interpretation are reviewed .",
    "then , in section 3 , we critically assess their interpretation .",
    "our main focus in this section is on the meaning of information in their approach to verify that to what extent ( if any ) they could coherently explain the peculiarities of quantum world .",
    "subsequently , in section 4 , we will show that once one is going to interpret brukner and zeilinger s measure of information in a real extension of the spin measurement , it can not quantify the amount of uncertainty in a suitable manner .",
    "the first topic in brukner and zeilinger s interpretation is that the whole physical description is based on _",
    "propositions_. application and selection of propositions is not arbitrary in their attitude ; rather it depends on what we want to learn about nature and what knowledge about nature we intend to discuss with others .",
    "emphasizing the role of propositions in physical description , brukner and zeilinger persist in a fundamental point which is a basic element in their interpretation : a quantum system is a construct based on complete list of propositions together with their truth values",
    ". a proposition , they assert for example , could be ( 1 )  the velocity of the object is @xmath0  or ( 2 )  the position of the object is @xmath1  .",
    "but since in quantum mechanics it is usually impossible to determine simultaneously the truth values of two arbitrary propositions , if the proposition ( 1 ) is definite , then the proposition ( 2 ) is completely indefinite and vice versa .",
    "the two propositions , here , are mutually exclusive .",
    "brukner and zeilinger consider this as a special case of quantum complementarity . in this way , a new language",
    "is represented for the physical description of quantum formalism , a language in which the propositions construct the _ essence _ of quantum systems instead of merely describing them .",
    "this is a starting point for critical arguments about their interpretation .",
    "the language of propositions in quantum mechanics is similar to the language which is used for the description of classical systems , except for the complementary situations which must also be taken into account in the quantum description .",
    "while we can always assign definite truth values to all propositions in ( deterministic ) classical theories , one can not assign simultaneously definite truth - values to mutually exclusive propositions in quantum mechanics .",
    "but even in cases that the truth values of two mutually exclusive propositions can not be assigned simultaneously , we can always specify the amount of information about them .",
    "so , according to brukner and zeilinger , this reveals a more fundamental notion which is _ knowledge _ and _ information _ : we can quantify our information about descriptive propositions in both the classical and quantum domains .",
    "what is changed , however , in passing from classical to quantum world is the replacement of the definite truth values with the finite amounts of information .",
    "they believe that this is the least expense which could be paid for the change in the epistemological structure of classical physics . in this view",
    ", information is regarded as _ the most fundamental notion _ [ 8 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",

    "can be subdivided to constituent propositions until we reach a final limit .",
    "the individual system that represents the truth value of one single proposition only , is called elementary system . beyond this limit",
    ", information is irreducible .",
    "so the principle of quantization of information states that [ 1 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ an elementary system carries 1 bit of information .",
    " _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for a complex system , consisting of @xmath2 elementary systems",
    "this principle is generalized to [ 1 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ n elementary systems carry n bits .  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the principle of quantization of information does not make any statement about how the @xmath2 bits of information are distributed over the @xmath2 systems .",
    "brukner and zeilinger consider this principle for systems with both independent and entangled subsystems .",
    "for example , for a spin-@xmath3 system ( like an electron ) there are always three complementary or mutually exclusive propositions for describing the spin situation .",
    "these are :  the spin along @xmath4 is up ( down ) ",
    ",  the spin along @xmath5 is up ( down )  and  the spin along @xmath6 is up ( down )  , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 are mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "complete information about one of the propositions is possible only through complete ignorance of two others .",
    "also for any other two - valued observable , there are three complementary propositions for describing the state of system , even though these propositions are not related with three space directions .",
    "now this question arises as to how the amount of information ( or the amount of uncertainty ) could be quantified in a statistical prediction ?",
    "brukner and zeilinger remark that in classical measurements in which it is assumed that the classical system has predetermined physical properties before a measurement is performed , the shannon information is an appropriate measure of uncertainty which can be defined as the following relation for @xmath9 possible outcomes :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a probability vector in the probability space with length @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the probability of occurrence of the outcome @xmath14 in a given measurement . for quantum measurements , however ,",
    "they introduce a new measure of information which is defined as [ 2 , 3 ] :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a normalization factor . in general , for a system in which maximally @xmath17 bits of information can be encoded , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for an elementary system which can carry only one bit of information , @xmath20 .",
    "then , one can reach the following relation :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the probabilities defined for a dichotomic observable and @xmath24 .",
    "if one of the probabilities is one , @xmath25 reaches its maximal value of 1 bit of information which is equivalent to the complete certainty .",
    "if both probabilities are equal , @xmath25 takes its minimal value of 0 bits of information which implies a complete uncertain ( or a complete random ) situation .",
    "we can write the measure of information ( 3 ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 . moreover",
    ", one can generalize the relation ( 3 ) , if the vector @xmath28 is defined in the information space as @xmath29 , where , e.g. , @xmath30 denotes the probability of finding the spin - up result along the @xmath31-direction .",
    "vector @xmath28 characterizes the information state of an elementary system which is , in schrdinger s terminology , a _ catalog of knowledge _ about a set of three mutually complementary propositions [ 4 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` it is assumed that the catalog @xmath28 is a complete description of the system in the sense that its knowledge is sufficient to determine the probabilities for the outcomes of all possible future measurements .

    ", the total information of an elementary system is defined as a sum of the individual measures of information over a complete set of mutually complementary propositions    @xmath32    where , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since an elementary system carries 1 bit of information , the total information is also equal to one .",
    "so , in different experimental setups where the components of @xmath28 adopt different values , the total information is always constant and equal to one for pure states .    in brukner and zeilinger s interpretation , an entangled state is also important from this point of view that an entangled system has more information than its individual constituents [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] .",
    "for example , consider the following singlet state for a pair of spin - half particles which is known as one of the four entangled bell states :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , e.g. , is the spin - up state of particle 1 along @xmath38-direction ( which can be chosen arbitrary ) .",
    "the total information represented by the entangled state ( 5 ) is @xmath39 .",
    "this means that two bits of information are carried by the whole system , corresponding to statements about the results of joint observations , `` the two spins are the same along @xmath1 '' and `` the two spins are the same along @xmath40 '' .",
    "the truth values of these propositions is false - false . since any product state of two particles ( like each single term in relation ( 5 ) ) carries only one bit of information , for any entangled state we have @xmath41 can be calculated for any set of spin measurements of two particles along two arbitrary directions . for more details , see for example [ 7 ] . ] .",
    "this is an important information condition which is the characteristic feature of entangled states .",
    "entanglement here is believed to be a secondary concept which its advantage is only due to its information content .    in this interpretation , wave function is only a mathematical representation which contains encoded information about a quantum system .",
    "our knowledge about a system gives it the possibility of being in a place at a given moment . in the measurement process , the quantum state which represents that knowledge changes",
    "this change is instantaneous , but it is only a change in our knowledge .",
    "our information about all of the other spatial points also changes instantaneously . however , there is nothing to be transmitted in a physical manner : there is no faster than light signalling .",
    "in addition , the total information content of the system remains constant [ 4 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` unlike a classical measurement , a quantum measurement thus does not just add ( if any ) some knowledge , it changes our knowledge in agreement with a fundamental finiteness of the total information content of the system .

    "brukner and zeilinger determine the rotation matrices for euler angles , with assumptions : ( 1 ) the invariance of the total information under rotation and ( 2 ) the homogeneity of rotational angles ( in the sense that adding a constant value to any of three rotational directions , does not change the physics of the problem and the location of vector @xmath43 in the information space remains unchanged ) [ 4 ] .",
    "according to these two assumptions , they show that for a spin - half particle , angular momentum generates the rotation .",
    "correspondingly , they want to extend a new formulation of quantum mechanics which is constructed on the information space , instead of an abstract vector space .",
    "moreover , they show that the following dynamical equation in quantum mechanics ,    @xmath44   \\tag{6}\\ ] ]    can be derived for an _ _ elementary system  _ _ from the time evolution of catalog of knowledge @xmath28 , in the information space [ 4 ] . in relation ( 6 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the density matrix and the hamiltonian of system , respectively .",
    "a key assumption here is that , for an isolated system with no information exchange with the environment , the total information of system is conserved in time .",
    "i.e. ,    @xmath47    there are still unsolved problems which are to be solved , as mentioned by themselves too .",
    "the measure of information defined in relation ( 2 ) has not yet been studied for continuous variables .",
    "one should also elucidate that in the information space , e.g. , how momentum can be inferred as the generator of transformation and how the schrdinger equation can be reformulated consistently .",
    "there is also no complete set of complementary observables for infinite hilbert spaces .    to sum up",
    ", the ultimate goal in brukner and zeilinger approach is to show that information is a fundamental notion which not only the inherent nature of quantum particles and quantum processes are based on its concept , but also a new formulation can emerge from its foundation .",

    "it is , however , important to remember that all features of this interpretation can not be categorized as instrumentalist or phenomenalist perspectives . as an instance",

    "nonetheless , one sees no clear definition of information and its conception in this interpretation .",
    "( a detailed discussion of this subject is given in appendix . )",
    "the principle of finiteness of information is also a matter of controversy .",
    "indeed , how can one verify that a quantum system must essentially have a finite information content ? many people may still be interested to know why we should have such a constraint about the possible measurement results .",
    "as many people , for example , are still curious to know why the thermodynamic systems inherently tend to go towards most probable states according to the second law of thermodynamics . since , one may some day discover a thermodynamic force which will explain the underlying reason of this tendency .    yet , there are some people who believe that an _ unlimited _ amount of information can be coded in a given quantum state .",
    "this can precisely be illustrated by wiesner s quantum multiplexing argument which states that one can always code two distinct one - bit messages into a spin-@xmath3 system [ 17 ] .",
    "however , the spin state is not an observable and there is no _ accessible _ information larger than a single bit .",
    "no observer can read both bits , but it is only possible to read one bit of information in any proper choice of measurement .",
    "the finiteness of gaining knowledge about the properties of a system is not a specific feature of quantum mechanics only .",
    "information constraints also exist for classical systems [ 18 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "any argument about the finiteness of information is contingent upon the fact that how one interprets the probability , not upon the fact that how one determines the quantity of information .",
    "brukner and zeilinger consider the randomness as an intrinsic property for quantum systems .",
    "but , they conclude this not as a possible interpretation of probability coming from outside the theory . instead , they believe that this is a natural consequence of the principle of finiteness of information .",

    "this can be defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the probability of the occurrence of a dichotomic result and @xmath56 is variance for binomial distribution [ 2 , 4 ] .",
    "then , for @xmath9 outcomes with the probabilities @xmath57 of the individual occurrences , they deduce the relation ( 2 ) as an appropriate measure of information .",
    "a crucial point here is that their measure of information requires not only that probabilities are known , but also that the number of possible outcomes @xmath58 is known ( see relation ( 2 ) ) . in turn , the value of @xmath9 is determined by @xmath17 which is defined as the maximum bits of information that can be encoded in a quantum system [ 2 , 4 ] . as a matter of fact",
    ", this means that two different notions of total information are to be taken into account in brukner and zeilinger s interpretation :    \\1 ) a total information @xmath17 defined as an input of the relation ( 2 ) which is determined by knowing the number of possible outcomes @xmath9 ,    \\2 ) a total information @xmath59 which is an output of relation ( 2 ) as the sum of the individual measures of information .",
    "considering those cases where @xmath17 bits of information can be maximally encoded , brukner and zeilinger define @xmath18 , or @xmath60 [ 2 ] .",
    "but , where is basically @xmath17 coming from ?",
    "the answer is that if one supposes @xmath9 equiprobable events which each event could occur with the same probability @xmath61 , @xmath17 would be precisely the shannon information @xmath62 for @xmath63 . here",
    ", @xmath17 is essentially endowed with a counterfactual meaning of information in the shannon sense of definition .",
    "one may consequently interpret that brukner and zeilinger s measure of information in ( 2 ) does need a form of the so - called microcanonical shannon entropy as an input .",
    "so , @xmath17 and @xmath59 are not principally the same and it is expected that they should not be the same numerically in some circumstances too .    to elaborate this point more palpably ,",
    "let us consider that in a _",
    "real _ experiment , there will be a non zero probability of non - detection for measuring each spin component of a spin half particle .",
    "suppose also that , _ ideally _ , the spin of particle would be expected to be up along @xmath1 .",
    "then , if the overall efficiencies of the measuring apparatuses are assumed to be the same along different directions , one can describe the statistics of the three possible events of spin up detection ( @xmath64 ) , spin down detection ( @xmath65 ) and no detection ( @xmath66 ) along @xmath1 , @xmath40 and @xmath31 with the following probabilities , respectively :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 denotes the overall efficiency ;",
    "@xmath69 , e.g. , is the probability of non - detection along @xmath1 and the detection probabilities are defined as before .",
    "using the relation ( 2 ) , one can obtain the individual information functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 along @xmath1 , @xmath40 and @xmath31 , respectively , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 :    @xmath75 ;   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "i_{2 } & = & i_{3}=\\dfrac{3\\log _ { 2}3}{2}\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\eta -\\frac{2}{% 3}\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( \\eta -\\frac{2}{3}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ]   \\tag{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after some simple algebra , one can get    @xmath76    the ratio of @xmath77 plotted as a function of @xmath68 is shown in figure1 . for @xmath78 ( perfect efficiency ) , the number of possible outcomes @xmath9 reduces to @xmath50 ( i.e. , there is no non - detection event ) and the relation ( 3 ) will be the appropriate expression for each individual measure of information .",
    "then , @xmath79 describes the total information content of an elementary system ( in our example , a spin half particle ) , according to brukner and zeilinger s interpretation .",
    "however , for @xmath80 , there are three possible outcomes and while in such an experiment @xmath17 denotes that a value of @xmath81 bits of information can be maximally encoded ( according to their definition ) , @xmath82 is given by ( 10 ) which depends on the efficiency factors of measuring devices .",
    "since , in different experiments @xmath68 may not be the same , @xmath42 can not be considered as a _ conserved _ value in principle .",
    "specially , for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath42 exceeds the maximal possible amount of information , i.e. , @xmath85 bits that can be encoded in an individual spin half particle .",
    "this is in contrast to what is expected for @xmath42 in the brukner and zeilinger s sense of definition [ 3 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` independent of the various possibilities to encode information , the total information content of the system can not fundamentally exceed the maximal possible amount of information that can be encoded in an individual observable .

    "its description is also clear for the above example .",
    "let us define @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 as the corresponding shannon uncertainties along the directions @xmath1 , @xmath40 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "then , one can obtain :    @xmath89    while for @xmath78 , @xmath86 indicates that there is no uncertainty about the value of the spin component of particle along @xmath1 , it increases as @xmath68 is being reduced to @xmath90 .",
    "this is the point where we have the maximum uncertainty of one bit for the spin component along @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath87(@xmath91 ) reaches its maximum value of @xmath92 bits ( which is the same value of @xmath17 ) for @xmath93 . nevertheless , as @xmath68 approaches to zero , all the uncertainties @xmath94 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 decrease , because the probabilities of detection along different directions approaches to zero .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath86 and @xmath87(@xmath91 ) are plotted against @xmath68 in figure 2 .",
    "the above example shows that the shannon and the brukner - zeilinger measures of information may have very different descriptions even for simple cases , when merely the primary definitions are extended to more concrete circumstances .",
    "it casts doubt upon the fact that whether the latter measure of information can retain its significance for more realizable physical examples .",
    "brukner and zeilinger s interpretation has brought up some provoking topics .",
    "statements about the essential nature of information , the finiteness of the information content of a quantum object , the possibility of deriving the quantum dynamics from an information basis and the definition of a new measure of information , all are interesting subjects which call for careful analysis . considering information as a fundamental notion",
    ", however , this interpretation encounters some difficulties and leaves us alone with not answered basic questions .",
    "it is not clear why a quantum object should have a finite information content in its essence , how the information vector evolve when one measures a physical quantity , and what really means as an instantaneous change in information during the measurement . here",
    ", we are confronted with a complex , multidimensional notion of information which its foundation is not clear .    on the other hand , brukner and zeilinger s definition of a new measure of information may lose its significance , when an elementary system is treated realistically in the spin measurements . here ,",
    "the possible number of outcomes @xmath9 may discriminate the value of the total information content in ideal and non - ideal measurements .",
    "so , one is encountered this basic question that what does an elementary system actually mean , when its information content can not be conserved in real practice ?      * * appendix**information is a notion with different concepts , and each concept has its own application(s ) [ 20 , 21 , 22 ] .",
    "it is hardly possible that a single concept of information can account for the various applications of this extensive field .",
    "however , it is worth looking into a special notion of information here : information with _ semantic _",
    "concept is something capable of providing knowledge [ 20 ] . in routledge encyclopedia of philosophy , one reads [ 23 ] `` the term information has various senses in ordinary discourse , including knowledge ..... and propositional content ..... information in these senses has semantic features , such as reference and truth - value . ''",
    "the main aspect of semantic information is about what a message or proposition means . in this sense , knowledge and semantic information",
    "are relative notions . to have knowledge about a system",
    ", we should describe the information content of that system by using the descriptive propositions .",
    "once information is available , knowledge can be built in terms of justified information .",
    "as stated by dretske in his semantic theory of information ( see [ 24 ] , p. 45 ) : `` a state of affairs contains information about x to just that extent to which a suitable placed observer could learn something about x by consulting it '' ( quoted also in [ 20 ] ) .",
    "dretske also qualifies information as a semantic concept in virtue of the intentionality inherent in its transmission .",
    "information receives its intentional character from the lawful regularities on which it depends ( for example , the laws of physics in the domain of physics ) .",
    "yet , it is not relevant in this view to ask where the intentional character of laws comes from ( see [ 24 ] , p. 77 and also [ 20 ] ) .",
    "this makes some conceptual difficulties regarding a well - defined relation between information and the physics from which information stems .",
    "floridi also analyzes the meaning of semantic information in terms of well - formed , meaningful and truthful data with a propositional orientation [ 22 ] . here ,",
    "`` well - formed '' means that data have been put together correctly according to some given rules and `` meaningful '' means that the data must also comply with the meanings of propositions .",
    "so , the semantic content in his view is formed on the basis of the well - formed and meaningful data represented by propositions with definite truth values which in turn are used to talk about the world and describe it .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` [ s]emantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem .",
    "the significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages . ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the shannon measure of information is purely quantitative .",
    "it only deals with amounts of information and disregards questions related to information content or the meaning of information .",
    "shannon information is commonly described as a study of information at the _ syntactic",
    "_ level , which can be studied by the mathematical theory of communication , also known as communication theory or information theory . according to syntactic concept , information theory is introduced with the application of random variables and probability distributions , so it is a mathematical theory .",
    "it has applicability to a variety of fields like communication theory , thermodynamics , computer science and algorithmic complexity [ 20 ] .",
    "the concept of information can also be treated physically . by the term _ physical _ ,",
    "we mean that information either can be transmitted via a physical entity ( i.e. , a signal ) , or is an objective property of the system which can be described by the physical laws , or both . according to this view",
    ", information is transmitted from one point to another point via a physical entity , i.e. , an information - bearing signal .",
    "this is in opposition to a semantic view where states that to establish an informational link between two distant locations , it is only necessary that one can have a knowledge at one location by looking at the other one .",
    "this point is similar to what is declared by brukner and zeilinger in one of their articles [ 4 ] :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` when the state of a quantum system has a non - zero value at some position in space at some particular time , it does not mean that the system is physically present at that point , but only that our knowledge ( or lack of knowledge ) of the system allows the particle the _ possibility _ of being present at that point at that instant .
