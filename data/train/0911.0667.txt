    "spatially homogeneous ( sh ) cosmologies are one of the main cornerstones of general relativity . on the one hand",
    ", they provide a rich supply of case studies for the effects that solutions of the einstein equations of general relativity can ( and will ) produce ; in particular , the behavior of sh cosmologies gives the necessary input to model the behavior of our actual universe . on the other hand , there are convincing arguments that the dynamics of generic solutions of the einstein equations close to spacelike singularities are built on the dynamics of sh cosmological models  @xcite .",
    "an sh cosmological model is a solution of the einstein equations that is independent of the spatial variables in a suitable frame ( see sec .",
    "[ sh ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "therefore , for these models , the einstein equations reduce to an autonomous system of non - linear ordinary differential equations . as first recognized by collins  @xcite , provided the system possesses the appropriate regularity , the equations can be analyzed using the potent methods of dynamical systems theory . since then , our knowledge of the ( qualitative ) dynamics of sh cosmological models has increased substantially , see  @xcite for reviews .    until recent years , the analysis of sh cosmologies has been largely restricted to isotropic matter sources like perfect fluids ( including dust ) and scalar fields .",
    "however , the results available for anisotropic matter sources , such as electromagnetic fields  @xcite , collisionless ( vlasov ) matter  @xcite , elastic materials  @xcite , and viscous fluids  @xcite , suggest that the dynamics of sh cosmological models are in fact sensitive to the choice of matter model , not merely quantitatively , but also qualitatively . a first step towards a systematic analysis of the influence of the matter model on the ( asymptotic ) dynamics of solutions",
    "was taken in  @xcite : by analyzing bianchi type  i solutions ( see sec .",
    "[ sh ] for the definition ) of the einstein - matter equations for a large class of ( anisotropic ) matter models that includes perfect fluids as a special case , it was shown that the qualitative dynamics of solutions ( and the asymptotics towards the initial singularity , in particular ) strongly depends on specific properties of the matter source .",
    "differences between perfect fluid solutions and anisotropic matter solutions even exist when the matter model resembles a perfect fluid very closely  @xcite , which suggests that , at least within the family of matter models considered , the perfect fluid model is ` structurally unstable ' .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of  @xcite to the higher bianchi types of class  a. sh cosmologies of these types , especially the type  ix solutions , are of particular interest",
    ". the important question of whether a cosmological model will expand forever or will recontract ( and eventually recollapse ) arises within this class of models .",
    "moreover , the understanding of type  ix solutions with their oscillatory behavior ( mixmaster behavior ) toward the initial singularity is regarded as one of the keys towards a better understanding of singularities in general relativity in general .    in this work",
    "we restrict to sh cosmologies that are locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) ; in particular , the isometry group of the spacetime is four - dimensional , see appendix  [ lrsexplained ] .",
    "the main result of the present paper can be summarized as follows : the folklore statement `` matter does not matter '' has clear limitations , which can be specified rigorously .",
    "the qualitative dynamics of ( sh lrs ) cosmological models is in fact matter - dependent ; cosmological models with anisotropic matter satisfying specific properties exhibit a completely different qualitative behavior than the corresponding perfect fluid solutions . the two most striking facts that we derive are the following .",
    "* there exist physically viable matter models such that the behavior of generic solutions toward the initial singularity is oscillatory ; this is in stark contrast to the behavior of vacuum and perfect fluid solutions .",
    "these models are lrs bianchi type  ii and  ix models .",
    "* there exist physically viable matter models such that `` closed - universe - recollapse ''  @xcite does not hold ; lrs bianchi type  ix solutions ( closed cosmologies ) need not necessarily recollapse ; there exists an open set of initial data such that the associated solutions expand forever .    by ` physically viable ' matter models we mean matter models that satisfy the standard energy conditions , the weak energy condition , the dominant energy condition , and the strong energy condition in particular .",
    "note that perfect fluid solutions of bianchi type  ix necessarily recollapse provided the strong energy condition holds .",
    "it is important to note that there exist important explicit examples of matter models that are directly covered by our analysis , e.g. , elastic matter and collisionless ( vlasov ) matter with massless particles , and matter models to which our techniques extend in a straightforward way , e.g. , magnetic fields and vlasov matter with massive particles ; we refer to sec .",
