    "we discuss a possible alternative definition of the current possible in euclidean space , and show why such a current is unacceptable .",
    "we begin by reminding the reader of the form of the free finite - element lattice dirac equation than in ref .",
    "@xcite , and correspondingly , a different definition of spinors in ( [ spinors ] ) and a change of sign in the unitary time evolution operator @xmath0 , ( [ timeevolution ] ) . ] : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the electron mass , @xmath3 is the temporal lattice spacing , @xmath4 is the spatial lattice spacing , @xmath5 represents a spatial lattice coordinate , @xmath6 a temporal coordinate , and overbars signify forward averaging : @xmath7 by transforming this into momentum space we find that the momentum expansion of the canonical dirac field is @xmath8 where the spinors are normalized according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and where @xmath12 in ( [ fourier ] ) @xmath13 is the eigenvalue of the dirac transfer matrix @xmath14 notice that we may solve ( [ lambda ] ) for @xmath15 : @xmath16 we take @xmath17 , the number of lattice points in a given spatial direction , to be odd , so that @xmath18 is periodic on the spatial lattice",
    ". it follows from ( [ fourier ] ) that the canonical lattice anticommutation relations for the dirac fields @xmath19 are satisfied if ( @xmath20 , the length of the spatial lattice )    @xmath21    and all other anticommutators of these operators vanish .    at this point",

    "it is instructive , and very simple , to consider the schwinger model , that is the case with dimension @xmath65 and mass @xmath66 .",

    ", we will find it useful to expand @xmath51 in powers of the temporal lattice spacing @xmath3 ( but not in the spatial lattice spacing @xmath4 ) .",

    "if we use the expression for the current in ( [ current ] ) and keep only terms of @xmath85 , we find @xmath86 thus , to leading order in @xmath3 , the vacuum expectation value of the divergence of the current is ( averaging in @xmath87 is implicit ) @xmath88\\tilde\\alpha^{(j)}_{m_j , m'_j } , \\label{vectoranomaly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 .",
    "not only is this not zero , it is not gauge invariant , for under a gauge transformation , @xmath90 this seems to be a conundrum , because the current was explicitly constructed to be gauge invariant .",
    "the resolution lies in the recognition that since the canonical field @xmath81 is covariant under time - independent gauge transformations , @xmath91 the states created by that operator must transform likewise .",
    "that is , we require @xmath92 this suggests we supply the following factor in computing the vacuum expectation values : @xmath93 because @xmath94 then , the derivative operator that occurs in ( [ vectoranomaly ] ) becomes @xmath95 since the term with @xmath96 does not contribute .    in the next order in @xmath3",
    "it appears that a nontrivial contribution could emerge .",
    "it is the following gauge - invariant structure ( here only the the leading term in @xmath97 is written down ) : @xmath98 this is a nonlocal term without a continuum analogue , because its gauge invariance depends on the periodic boundary conditions on the spatial lattice .",
    "however , to this order , since @xmath99 , a simple inspection shows that the coefficient of this term is zero .",
    "the axial current is defined just as in ( [ current ] ) with the additional factor of @xmath100 .",
    "we compute the divergence analogously to ( [ vectoranomaly ] ) , except here the first apparently nonzero term is @xmath101 : @xmath102 \\tilde\\alpha^{(k)}_{m^{\\vphantom{\\prime}}_k , m'_k } \\tilde\\alpha^{(l)}_{m^{\\vphantom{\\prime\\prime}}_l , m''_l}. \\label{axialanomaly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the diagonal property of @xmath103 in the perpendicular coordinates [ see ( [ eq : d ] ) ] , ( [ axialanomaly ] ) is zero .",
    "so , to @xmath85 both the vector and axial - vector currents are nonanomalous .",
    "this may be a bit surprising since when @xmath67 an axial - vector anomaly emerges in @xmath104 dimensions .",
    "we are presently trying to understand this state of affairs by carrying out an exact calculation with @xmath67 in @xmath77 dimensions .",
    "it is extremely interesting to compute commutators of the current defined by ( [ current ] ) , and compare with the anomalous commutators in the continuum@xcite : @xmath105\\rangle = is\\bbox{\\nabla}\\delta({\\bf x } ) + { id}\\bbox{\\nabla}\\nabla^2\\delta({\\bf x}),\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the quadratically divergent schwinger term , and @xmath107 for the bjorken - johnson - low regularization .",

    "( that is , the base-@xmath17 number @xmath113 is converted to a base-10 value of the abscissa . )",
    "it is apparent that the leading - order behavior of this commutator is a first derivative of the delta function , as expected .    to make this comparison quantitative",
    ", we fit this result to the functional form expected in the continuum .",
    "the lattice analog of the dirac delta function is @xmath114 so we take as a trial function @xmath115 when @xmath66 , the coefficients @xmath116 do not depend on the lattice spacing @xmath4 ; they will presumably remain finite in the continuum limit , @xmath117 .",
    "the functions @xmath118 are inserted to force each term in the series to be of the same order in @xmath4 as the commutator ( [ comm ] ) , namely @xmath119 : @xmath120 therefore , in the continuum limit , the first term in the series ( [ fit ] ) will be quadratically divergent , the second will be finite , and the rest will vanish , as expected .    to perform the fit , the problem is first converted from a three - dimensional to a two - dimensional representation .",

    "[ fig1 ] is projected onto a plane orthogonal to the @xmath121 , @xmath122 plane and to the diagonal of the matrix .",

    "similarly , the result for the coefficient of the third derivative term in the commutator is in approximate agreement with the agreement with the bjl result @xcite ; but seems to be closer to that of chanowitz @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that the results are regularization dependent , given the divergent nature of the commutator .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this calculation will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is illuminating to calculate physical quantities such as the magnetic moment or the axial - vector anomaly by doing perturbation theory on the lattice .",
    "that is , we calculate quantities such as vacuum polarization by using weak - coupling perturbation theory together with the lattice propagators given in ( [ diracgreen ] ) and ( [ photongreen ] ) .",
    "we illustrate this idea in the simple context of the schwinger model , two - dimensional qed .",

    "we begin by discussing the schwinger model ( @xmath65 electrodynamics ) in the continuum . to calculate the anomaly it is essential to work with massive qed@xmath124 and then take the massless limit to avoid infrared singularities .",
    "the vacuum polarization is then @xmath125 we require that @xmath126 be transverse : @xmath127 contracting on the indices gives @xmath128 which is easily expressed using feynman parameters as @xmath129 for the @xmath130 theory , we require that @xmath131 . this implies the presence of a subtraction constant @xmath132 , which for the @xmath66 theory is the square of the boson mass , or the anomaly . rather than introduce a feynman parameter",
    "we could obtain this result by setting @xmath133 in ( [ vp ] ) and performing the momentum integration explicitly .",
    "we have , then , for the unsubtracted vacuum polarization @xmath134 which again gives the usual result , @xmath135 .",
    "we now describe the analogous calculation in the finite - element lattice framework .",

    "in the text we simply assumed a form of the current ( [ current ] ) which was manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "we are at liberty to do so , because the minkowski finite - element equations of motion are not derivable from a lagrangian .",
    "the current can not be derived from the dirac equation , but is an independent source for the maxwell equations , see ref .",
    "@xcite . however , if one were to work in euclidean space - time ( periodic in all four directions ) , it is possible to construct an action from which the equations of motion are derivable , and which therefore supplies a lattice current .",
    "the fermion part of that action is ( a factor of @xmath170 is absorbed in going to euclidean space ) @xmath171 if we vary ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath172 we obtain the euclidean dirac equation @xmath173 where , as in ( [ action ] ) , a four - dimensional scalar product is implied .",
    "given an action , we can construct a conserved vector current by making a local gauge transformation @xmath174 because the dirac equation , and hence the action , is invariant under the global version of ( [ gt ] ) , @xmath175 , we must have by the action principle @xmath176 from which we read off the conserved current @xmath177 ( the same result , of course , can be obtained by varying @xmath63 with respect to @xmath178 . ) the expression for this euclidean current has been simplified by deleting constant terms . it is easy to verify explicitly that this current is both conserved and gauge invariant .",
    "similarly , by making a chiral transformation , @xmath179 we can construct the axial - vector current @xmath180 , which has the form of ( [ eculidcur ] ) with the replacement @xmath181 by construction , these currents possess no anomalies .",
    "however , they appear to be completely unacceptable , because they are horribly nonlocal .",
    "in particular , they possess no minkowski analogues , in the sense that it is not possible to analytically continue back to real unbounded times .",
