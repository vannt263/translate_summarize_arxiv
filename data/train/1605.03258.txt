    "<S> the theory is in good agreement with experimental data for excess ( over the crystal state ) thermodynamics of molecular glass formers . </S>",

    "<S> this scenario has observable consequences : ( i ) a dynamical cross - over of the relaxation time and ( ii ) the fragility index defined by the ratio of the excess heat capacity and excess entropy at the glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> the kauzmann temperature of vanishing configurational entropy , and the corresponding glass transition temperature , shift upward when the electric field is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature shift scales quadratically with the field strength . </S>"
