    "computer - mediated feedback is essential .",
    "as is well known , in both cesium clocks that realize the si second and in the most stable optical atomic clocks , the atom or atoms in the atomic clock are passive  they do not `` tick''so the clock needs an active oscillator and other components in addition to the atom(s ) .",
    "an atomic clock operates a feedback loop in which a guessed hypothesis steers the rate of ticking of its oscillator .",
    "an atomic clock s components include @xcite :    1 .",
    "an active _ oscillator _ radiating at microwave or optical frequencies , cycling through phases adjustable over a narrow range of frequency ( picture a driven pendulum ) .",
    "2 .   a controllable `` gear box",
    ", '' called a frequency _ synthesizer _ , that produces an output frequency at a variable ratio to that of the oscillator , 3 .",
    "one or more passive resonant atoms illuminated by radiation from the oscillator ; 4 .   a real - time computer that controls the oscillator and the synthesizer ; 5 .",
    "detectors of the unforeseeable outcomes of interaction of the atom(s ) with the oscillator s radiation that write records into the computer memory ; 6 .   a formula encoded in the computer memory that defines the how the computer steers the oscillator frequency and the synthesizer in response to deviations of accumulating recorded evidence from an hypothesized _ aiming point_.    in designing an atomic clock to realize the si second , one encounters , among others , the following two problems .",
    "( a ) the resonance exhibited by the atom or atoms of the clock varies with the details of the clock s construction and the circumstances of its operation ; in particular the resonance shifts depending on the intensity of the radiation of the atoms by the oscillator .",
    "( b ) the oscillator , controlled by , in effect , a knob , drifts in relation to the knob setting .",
    "problem ( a ) is dealt with by introducing a wave function parametrized by radiation intensity and whatever other factors one deems relevant .",
    "the second is then `` defined '' in terms of the resonance the `` would be found '' at zero temperature ( implying zero radiation ) @xcite . for a clock using cesium 133 atoms ,",
    "this imagined resonance is declared by the general conference of weights and measures to be 9 192 631 770 hz , so that the si second is that number of cycles of the radiation corresponding to that imagined resonance @xcite .",
    "problem ( b ) is dealt with by feedback that adjusts a `` knob '' that controls the oscillator , in response to detections of scattering of the oscillator s radiation by the atom or atoms of the clock , so that the oscillator is steered toward an aiming point at which the detection rate is sensitive to small displacement of the oscillation from the aiming point .",
    "cs at 0 k from chosen wave function ( dashed line ) .",
    "feedback steers oscillator frequency @xmath1 toward an aiming point for which the detection rate is sensitive to a small change in the oscillator frequency .",
    "[ fig : mut ] ]    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mut ] , the drift of the oscillator is indicated by variation in the detection rate ( which , apart from some statistical variation , varies with changes in the oscillator frequency relative to the resonance of the radiated atoms ) . the aiming point is set at a fixed detection rate , chosen to be sensitive to variation in the oscillator frequency relative to the resonance of the atoms as radiated by the oscillator .",
    "the function illustrated by the bell - shaped curve , which would be obtained from experimental data , is coded into the computer to express detection rate _",
    "vs_.  deviation of the oscillation from the resonance of the radiated atom(s ) .",
    "the aiming point for the oscillator frequency differs from the imagined frequency at 0 k for two reasons : ( a ) it differs from the resonant peak for the atom(s ) radiated by the oscillator to get a more sensitive response , and ( b ) that resonant peak differs by an amount depending on a chosen wave function from the defining imagined resonance at 0 k. the synthesizer gears the output frequency of the clock to the oscillator so as to account for the ratio of the resonance hypothesized at 0 k to the aiming point for the oscillator .",
    "computer - mediated feedback used in an atomic clock requires logic open to an inflow of inputs beyond the reach of calculation . to model the logic of a computer that communicates with the other devices in a feedback loop , we modify a turing machine to communicate with external devices , including other such machines .",
    "one thinks of a turing machine , modified or not , as making a record on a tape marked into squares , each square holding one character of an alphabet .",
    "operating in a cyclic sequence of ` moments ' interspersed by ` moves ' , at any moment the machine scans one square of the tape , on which it can read or write a single character .",
    "a move as defined in the mathematics of turing machines consists ( only ) of the logical relation between the machine at one moment and the machine at the next moment @xcite , thus expressing the logic of a computation , detached from its speed , so that that two computations executing at different speeds can be represented in their logic by the same sequence of moves . in a feedback loop ,",
    "however , computational speed matters , and so we let the moves of the modified turing machine be stepped by ticks of a clock .",
    "a step occurs once per period of revolution of the clock hand .",
    "this period is adjustable , on the fly .",
    "a cycle of the modified turing machine corresponds to a unit interval of the readings of its clock .    to express communication between turing machines",
    ", we postulate that the modified turing machine can receive externally supplied signals and can transmit signals , with both the reception and the transmission geared to the cycle of the machine .",
    "in addition , the modified turing machine registers a count of moments at which signals are received and moments at which signals are transmitted .",
    "at a finer scale , _ the machine records a phase quantity in the cycle of its clock , relative to the center of the moment at which a signal carrying a character arrives .",
    "we call such a machine an _ open machine_. an open machine can receive detections and can command action , for instance the action of increasing or decreasing the frequency of the variable oscillator of an atomic clock .    in contradistinction to an open machine , one might speak of the usual turing machine ( which turing called an automatic machine @xcite ) as _ closed_. calculations performed on a closed machine proceed from start to halt by a succession of moves made according to a pre - programmed rule , closed to outside influences , neither receiving anything nor commanding any action .",
    "such `` closed '' calculations correspond to logic in which atomic propositions never change their truth values .",
    "in contrast , calculations performed on an open machine communicating with detectors and actuators proceed by moves made according to a rule that can be modified from outside the machine in the course of its operation",
    ". these calculations can respond to received influences , such as occurrences of outcomes underivable from the contents of the machine memory , so that the open machine writes commands on a tape read by an external actuator .",
    "the wider physical world shows up in an open machine as both ( 1 ) unforeseeable messages from external devices and ( 2 ) commands to external devices .",
    "we picture the records made by a real - time computer in a feedback loop as written on the tape of an open machine .",
    "the segmentation into moments interspersed by moves is found not just in turing machines but in any digital computer , which implies    the logical result of any computation is oblivious to variations in speed at which the clock steps the computer .",
    "* corollary 2.1*. _ no computer can sense directly any variation in its clock frequency .",
    "_    although it can not directly sense variation in the tick rate of its clock , the logic of open machine , thought of as stepped by an atomic clock , can still control the adjustment of the clock s oscillator by responding to variations in the detection rate written moment by moment onto its turing tape .",
    "a flow of unforeseeable detections feeds successive computations of results , each of which , promptly acted on , impacts probabilities of subsequent occurrences of outcomes , even though those subsequent outcomes remain unforeseeable . the computation that steers the oscillator depends not just on unforeseeable inputs , but also on a steering formula coded into a program .    * remarks * :    1 .   to appreciate feedback",
    ", one needs to distinguish any formula as as written from what it expresses .",
    "for example a formula written along a stretch of a turing tape as a string of characters can name a wave function @xmath2 that depends on a time variable @xmath3 . like a formula chalked on a blackboard ,",
    "the formula containing @xmath2 , once written , `` sits motionless , '' in contrast to the time variation that the formula expresses .",
    "2 .   although unchanged over some cycles of a feedback loop , a steering formula does not stay put for ever .",
    "a feedback loop operates in a larger context , in which steering formulas are subject to evolution .",
    "sooner or later , the string of characters that expresses the steering formula is apt to be overwritten by a characters expressing a new formula .",
    "occasions for rewriting steering formulas are routine in clock networks , including those employed in geodesy and astronomy .",
    "3 .   noticing feedback raises an opportunity to improve the short - term stability of an atomic clock .",
    "recall that the oscillator is steered in frequency by responding to deviations in detection rate from an assumed operating point .",
    "if the clock keeps a record of these deviations , the record could be used to make corrections to the clock s readings that takes the deviations into account , thereby improving the corrected stability of the clock .",
    "because open machines ( and computers ) are stepped through phases by clocks , signals communicating logical symbols from one open machine to another must arrive at a computer during a certain phase and not during other phases .",
    "a reading @xmath4 of the clock of an open machine @xmath5an @xmath5-reading  has the form @xmath6 where an integer @xmath7 indicates the count of cycles and @xmath8 is the phase within the cycle .",
    "thus the clock reading of an open machine passes through an integer value as the phase of the clock hand passes through zero .",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath9 .",
    "we define a _ channel _ from @xmath5 to @xmath10 , denoted @xmath11 , as a set of pairs , each pair of the form @xmath12 .",
    "the first member @xmath6 is an @xmath5-reading at which machine @xmath5 can transmit a signal and @xmath13 is a @xmath10-reading at which the clock of machine @xmath10 can register the reception of the signal .",
    "a _ repeating channel _ is defined to be a channel @xmath11 such that @xmath14)(\\exists m , n , j , k ) ( m+\\ell j.\\phi_{a,\\ell},n+\\ell k.\\phi_{b,\\ell } ) \\in \\abr,\\ ] ] for theoretical purposes , it is convenient to define an _ endlessly repeating channel _ for which @xmath15 ranges over all integers .",
    "again for theoretical purposes , we sometimes consider channels for which the phases are all zero , in which case one may omit writing the phases .",
    "when two - way repeating channels @xmath11 and @xmath16 link open machines @xmath5 and @xmath10 , a lower bound on the clock reading at which @xmath5 can receive an acknowledegment from @xmath10 comes from the following    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * definition of echo count : * suppose that at its reading @xmath17 an open machine @xmath5 transmits a signal at to an open machine @xmath10 , and the first signal that @xmath10 can transmit back to @xmath5 after receiving @xmath5 s signal reaches @xmath5 at @xmath18 ; then the quantity @xmath19 will be called the echo count @xmath20 at @xmath7 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    thus @xmath21 is a lower bound on the cycle count at which @xmath5 can receive an acknowledgement of a transmission sent at @xmath5-reading @xmath7 to @xmath10 . in the theoretical case in which receptions occur at null phases , echo counts are integers .",

    "models taking part in the steering of physical clocks contribute to the generation of echo counts as evidence that , one acquired , can stimulate the guessing of new models that come closer to the aiming point .",

    "in steering , evidence of deviations from the aiming point combine with hypotheses concerning how to steer @xcite .",
    "for example , consider a case of an aiming for two open machines @xmath5 and @xmath10 , as in the first example of sec .",
    "[ sec : typei ] . recall that the open machine @xmath5 is modeled by a given worldline with given clock readings@xmath4 .",

    "machine @xmath10 must predict ahead by at least @xmath91 .",
    "that is , steering deviations by one open machine are measured in part by their effect on receptive phases of other open machines , so that steering of one machine requires information about receptive phases measured by other machines , and the deviations from an aiming point must increase with increasing propagation delays that demand predicting further ahead .    as is clear from the cluster of five machines discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : typei ] , the aiming - point phases can not in general all be taken to be zero .",
    "for any particular aiming - point phase @xmath152 there will be a deviation of a measured phase quantity @xmath102 given by @xmath153 whatever the value of @xmath152 , adjustments to contain phases within tolerable bounds depends on phase changes happening only gradually , so that trends can be detected and responded to on the basis of adequate prediction . +",
    "* remarks : *    1 .",
    "while it is often convenient to assume that cycle counts of open machines are free of uncertainty , recognizing uncertainty in measured phases and their deviations from aiming point has an immediate and interesting implication . for logic to work in a network , transmission of logical symbols",
    "must preserve sharp distinctions among them ; yet the maintenance of sharp distinctions among transmitted symbols requires responses to fuzzy measurements . 2 .",
    "the acquisition of logical synchrony in digital communications involves an unforeseeable waiting time , like the time for a coin on edge to fall one way or the other @xcite .",
    "here we touch on questions of type iii . up to this point",
    "we have looked at one or another manifold with metric @xmath42 as some given hypothesis , whether explored on the blackboard or coded into an open machine to serve in steering toward an aiming point . for it use in steering",
    "we think of @xmath42 as `` given''one might say for use `` ballistically , '' without any `` piloting . '' but type - iii questions recognize that unforeseen deviations of phases outside of tolerances can happen , and an aiming point based on a hypothesized metric tensor can be found to be unreachable . recognizing that an hypothesis of a metric tensor can reach the end of its useful life calls for `` piloted '' hypothesis making , recognizing that each hypothesis of a metric tensor field is provisional , to be revised as prompted by deviations outside allowed tolerances assigned for steering toward an aiming point that incorporates that metric tensor field .",
    "drawing on measured phases as evidence in order to adjust a hypothesis of a metric tensor is one way to view the operation of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite . while ligo sensitivity drops off severely below 45 hz , the arrangement of five open machines of prop .",

    "except locally , einstein synchronization is unavailable to the curved spacetimes of general relativity @xcite .",
    "still , general relativity holds fast to the image of a predictable future , seemingly unwelcoming of surprise , as if what i do not foresee within my ( relativistic ) future is the fault of my ignorance , which i can hope to remedy .",
    "but if explanations in terms of wave functions are undetermined by any amount of evidence , and therefore are subject to surprises that prompt their revision , how do we float the future on any ` river of time ' ?    by accepting unforeseeable events , and by reflecting within itself a range of guesses that respect given evidence , logical synchronization",

    "_ how freedom of choice of wave function for atomic clocks implies freedom of choice in the smoothing of a metric tensor as an explanation of clock readings .",
    "_ both for arrangements of clocks near and on earth and for cosmological endeavors , one has occasion to choose a metric tensor field consistent with one or another body of experimental evidence of clock readings in the form of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "clock readings come with error bars on phases contribute evidence used in choosing a metric tensor field .",
    "think of two error bars separated by a variable distance ; as the distance shrinks the range of slopes of lines consistent with error bars increases .",
    "the resulting indeterminacy in the metric tensor thus involves a scale over which smoothing is applied , and at short scales of time and distance the room for choice of both spacetime curvature and clock - rate variation grows while maintaining consistency with experimental data .",
    "how chosen wave functions for atomic clocks affect spacetime curvature .",
    "_ additional freedom of metric tensor fields chosen to explain clock readings arises because , as sketched in [ sec : clk ] , a chosen wave function references the si second to an imagined resonance at absolute zero temperature .",
    "one might hypothesize a fine - scale variation in the 0 k offset of atomic clocks from from moment to moment and clock to clock as what we have called a clock - adjustment field @xcite , or one might smooth this adjustment field .",
    "this difference between the smoothed and unsmoothed clock - adjustment fields implies a difference in the corresponding metric tensor fields chosen to explain clock readings .",
    "if the smoothed readings underlie an hypothesized metric tensor field @xmath28 , then the unsmoothed readings would correspond to a metric tensor field as expressed by a conformal transformation @xmath154 , where @xmath155 and @xmath95 is the 4-dimensional spacetime coordinate of some assumed chart .",
    "the two metric tensor fields , even if differing only slightly , can imply markedly different spacetime curvatures because towo powers of derivatives  e.g .",
    "a term @xmath156that appears in relating the curvature of one spacetime to that of the other @xcite .",
    "thus the smallness of the clock shift @xmath157 is multiplied in its effect on curvature by the rapidity of its variation as expressed in these derivatives .",
    "further development of group representations of freedom of choice in explanations of given evidence .",
    "_ as we have seen above , unforeseeability brings open choices of explanations that respect given evidence , such as the choice of a wave function , resolved by guesswork .",

    "one learns quantum mechanics starting ` the other way ' : given a wave function and a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) expressing a measurement procedure , one learns to calculate probabilities of outcomes .",
    "but an atomic clock poses an ` inverse problem ' of arriving at a quantum model from given probabilities .",
    "if one knew the hilbert space and a sufficient set of measurement operators , the density operator ( or the wave function ) could be determined , provided that the quantum state under study could be prepared repeatedly @xcite .",

    "thus the logic of quantum tomography is circular , which raises the question : given probabilities abstracted from laboratory work , how is one to arrive at a wave function without assuming knowledge of measurement operators that itself presupposes knowledge of some density operators ?",
    "quantum theory reflects within the grammar of its mathematical language a distinction between experimental results and their explanations .",
