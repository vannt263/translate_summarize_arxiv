    "the heating mechanism of the solar corona is one of the most mysterious issue in astrophysics @xcite . in the corona",
    ", the temperature rises to a few million degrees . to maintain such a high temperature in the corona in spite of cooling by heat conduction and radiative losses ,",
    "a continuous supply of thermal energy is necessary .",
    "x - ray observations from space experiments ( e.g. skylab ) have shown that the corona is not uniform and consists of many bright loops .",
    "two promising models for coronal heating @xcite are : heating by small scale flares triggered by magnetic reconnection , and heating by the dissipation of alfvn waves that propagate in the magnetic flux tubes @xcite .",
    "however , there are other types of waves such as acoustic , slow - mode and fast - mode waves which are strongly damped or reflected at the steep density and temperature gradients of chromosphere and transition region . as an origin of alfvn waves",
    ", @xcite considered a photospheric random motion propagating along an open magnetic flux tube in the solar atmosphere , and performed mhd simulations for solar spicule formation and the coronal heating .",
    "they have shown that alfvn waves transport sufficient energy flux into the corona .",
    "@xcite estimated the energy flux carried by transversal oscillations generated by spicules and compared by the result of @xcite .",
    "they indicated that the calculated energy flux is enough to heat the quiet corona and to accelerate the high - speed solar wind .",
    "there are many proposed mechanisms for the dissipation of alfvn waves .",
    "interaction of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves with inhomogeneous plasmas in which has density gradients in both x- and z - directions , can leads to a number of very interesting physical phenomena , such as mode coupling @xcite , resonant absorption @xcite , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite , and phase mixing @xcite .",
    "these phenomena can affect the mhd wave dynamics and cause enhanced dissipation and heating of astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the idea is that when a density gradient of a medium is perpendicular to the magnetic field , the alfvn speed is a function of the transverse coordinate . on each magnetic field line ,",
    "alfvn waves propagate with their local alfvn speed . after a certain time and distance , as height increases , perturbations by alfvn waves of neighboring magnetic field lines become out of phase and have different wavelengths , causing large gradients in alfvn wavefront in the direction of the inhomogeneity , that is the phase mixing .",
    "dissipation then appears allowing the energy in the wave to heat the plasma .",
    "phase mixing of propagating alfvn waves in a stratified atmosphere , particularly , in solar spicules has been studied by @xcite .",
    "they concluded that dissipation of propagating alfvn waves can occur in space rather than in time .",
    "moreover , they found that the calculated damping times are much longer than spicule life times . @xcite",
    "have studied the phase mixing of alfvn waves in the case of shear flows and fields .",
    "it is determined that the shear flow and field can enhance the damping of standing alfvn waves . @xcite",
    "have showed that the enhanced phase mixing can occur both with density gradients and sheared magnetic fields .",
    "spicules are one of the most fundamental components of the solar chromosphere .",
    "they are seen in spectral lines at the solar limb at speeds of about @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 propagating from photosphere into the magnetized low atmosphere of the sun @xcite .",
    "their diameter and length varies from spicule to spicule having the values from @xmath2  km to @xmath3  km and from @xmath4  km to @xmath5  km , respectively .",
    "the typical lifetime of them is @xmath6 min .",
    "the typical electron density at heights where the spicules are observed is approximately @xmath7 m@xmath8 , and their temperatures are estimated as @xmath9 k @xcite .",

    "recently , @xcite based on _",
    "hinode_/sot observations estimated the oscillation period of spicule axis around @xmath13 s. they concluded that the energy flux stored in spicule axis oscillations is of order of coronal energy loss in quiet sun . despite the large body of theoretical and observational works devoted to the spicules , their ejection mechanism is not clear yet , and observations with high spatial resolutions are needed to distinguish their origin . @xcite",
    "investigated the statistical properties of alfvnic waves in solar spicules based on sot / hinode observations .",
    "they observed a mix of upward and downward propagating as well as standing waves .",
    "they found the occurrence rate of @xmath14 for standing waves .",
    "they concluded that in some spicules there are waves propagating upward and downward to form a standing wave in the middle of the spicule .",
    "@xcite performed the numerical simulations of the propagation of alfvnic pulses in two dimensional magnetic field geometries .",
    "they concluded that for an alfvnic pulse the time at which different parts of the pulse emerge into the corona depends on the plasma density and magnetic field properties .",
    "moreover , they discussed that this mechanism can interpret spicule ejection forced through the transition region .",
    "@xcite studied the upward propagation of a velocity pulse launched initially below the transition region .",
    "the pulse quickly steepens to a shock .",
    "they concluded that such a model may explain speed , width , and heights of classical spicules .",
    "this can be a motivation to study the phase mixing of upward propagating alfvn waves .",
