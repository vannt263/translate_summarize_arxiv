    "a novel type of extensive air shower ( eas ) array ( the prisma project ) has been proposed some years ago @xcite to study cosmic ray spectrum and mass composition in the `` knee '' region .",
    "existing experimental data in the knee region contradict each other and new approaches to the so - called `` knee problem '' are needed to solve this complicated and old problem .",
    "the prisma project is based on an idea that the main eas component - hadrons has to be measured first of all .",
    "special detectors ( en - detectors ) have been developed for this purpose .",
    "it was proposed to combine the central part of the prisma array with the lhaaso project @xcite by introducing the en - detectors in the center of lhaaso array .",
    "the en - detectors will make the lhaaso array sensitive to the hadronic eas component thus making it more powerful and informative .",
    "we used the corsika program @xcite ( ver .",
    "6.900 ) for eas simulations with qgsjet and gheisha models . calculations were performed for two primaries : proton and iron and for two altitudes : near sea level ( 170 m a.s.l . ) and high mountain 4300 m a.s.l . as a first step we made calculations for fixed primary energies from 10tev through 10pev and zenith angles @xmath0 .",
    "we present here results for the number of hadrons and produced by them thermal neutrons inside a ring of 50 m radius around the eas axis as a function of primary energy .",
    "the distributions over these numbers are also obtained .    as any other monte - carlo program for eas simulation , corsika can not process particles with very low energies .",
    "we used following cuts for particles : 50mev for hadrons , 0.5gev for muons , 60kev for electrons and gammas .",
    "the mean number of evaporation neutrons @xmath1 produced by hadrons in 3-m layer of surrounding soil and/or construction materials has been calculated using an empirical relationship between them and the parent hadron energy ( in gev ) : @xmath2 this relationship originated from secondary particles production in hadronic interactions and was obtained taking into account experimental data @xcite and atomic mass a dependence of neutron production : @xmath3@xcite .",
    "therefore , the total number of produced secondary neutrons should be summarized over all hadrons : @xmath4 it is easy to see that due to slow dependence on hadron energy and due to slow change of hadron mean energy with primary energy , @xmath5 can be simplified to : @xmath6 the latter means that the total number of evaporation neutrons produced in eas should be more or less proportional to the number of high - energy hadrons reaching the observation level .",
    "the great bulk of these neutrons are thermalized later . thus recording thermal neutrons by detectors spread over big enough area one could recover the number of hadrons in eas",
    "this idea is a basis of the prisma project .",
    "mean numbers of produced neutrons and hadrons inside a ring of 50 m as a function of primary energy are shown in fig . 1 for primary proton and iron and for near sea level .",
    "as one can see , all dependencies can be fitted with power law functions .",
    "all indices for protons are close to 1 : @xmath7 at sea level and @xmath8 at 4300 m. for iron the indeces are little bit steeper at these energies .",
    "small difference between primary proton and iron at the highest energy makes us sure that recovery of primary energy would be more adequate in the knee region .",
    "one can also see that the mean number of neutrons at sea level and at 4300 m a.s.l .",
    "differ by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "the latter means that at yangbajing level the array threshold energy can be lower by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "mean numbers of hadrons and secondary evaporation neutrons inside ring of 50 m radius as a function of primary energy at sea level for proton and iron primaries and at 4300 m for primary proton.,width=321 ]        there are shown in fig .",
    "2 the distributions of different eas components numbers inside 50 m around the axis for 2 primary energies : 30tev and 1pev .",
    "an interesting issue here is rather high mean number of produced neutrons in comparison with hadrons and muons .",
    "the latter means that thermal neutrons could be a better primary energy estimator than muons or high energy hadrons .",
    "figure 2 also presents that at high altitude , within the primary energy range 30tev-10pev , the secondaries have higher quantities and then lead to higher energy resolution than ones at sea level .",
    "it is necessary to test these simulation results at different altitudes .",
    "we have made several tests with the prisma prototypes in moscow .",
    "our test results are consistent with the simulations . a prototype of the prisma project array ( protoprisma ) @xcite has been developed and started running on a base of the nevod - decor detector at national research nuclear university mephi in moscow ( 170 m a.s.l .",
    "it consists now of 32 inorganic scintillator @xmath11 situated inside the experimental building at a level of 4th floor just around the nevod water pool .",
    "the neutron recording efficiency of the en - detector is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the detectors have a cylindrical shape with the scintillator area equal to 0.36 @xmath13 .",
    "it is now our standard en - detector made on a base of commercial polyethylene ( pe ) water tank of 200 liters volume .",
    "the scintillator thin sheets are situated on its bottom and are viewed by a single 6  pmt ( feu-200 ) .",
    "the scintillator compound zns(ag)+ lif enriched with @xmath14 up to @xmath15 is very effective scintillator for heavy particle detection .",
    "it produces 160000 photons per a neutron capture through the reaction @xmath14(n , a)t + 4.8 mev .",
    "it allows us to collect more than 50 photoelectrons from pmt photo - cathode per n - capture . due to thin scintillator layer ( 30 @xmath16 )",
    ", a single relativistic charged particle produces very small signal .",
    "but , in a case of eas passage , correlated signals from many particles are summarized and can be measured .",
    "therefore , the same detectors are used to measure two eas components : hadronic ( neutrons ) and electromagnetic .",
    "that is why we call them as en - detectors ( electron - neutron ) .",
    "the array consists now of 2 clusters of 16 detectors each .",
    "the clusters have their own triggering system and work independently .",
    "coincidence of 2 or more hit detectors within time of 2 @xmath17s produces a simple trigger and on - line program preprocesses data , selects eas events and marks them in accordance with different mathematical trigger conditions .",
    "all pulses are integrated with a time constant of 1 @xmath17s and are digitized using 10 bits flash adc with a step of 1 @xmath17s . in a case of powerful enough eas , full pulse waveform of 20 ms duration is stored .",
    "for energy deposit measurement in a wide range we use 2 signals from each detectors : from the last 12th dynode and from an intermediate 7th dynode as well . due to this",
    "we have the energy range more than @xmath18 .",
    "delayed pulses from thermal neutrons captures are measured in each detector in the time gate 0.1 - 20 ms .    in order to test our simulations at sea level ,",
    "we have processed the experimental data accumulated for 2 winter months with the aim to check eq.(1 ) normalization factor .",
    "it is obvious that absolute value of neutron yield depends on the experimental conditions . in our case",
    "the array is not situated in open air , but inside the building .",
    "therefore , the result can be regarded as an estimation only .",
    "detailed neutron yield measurements will be performed later when the next prisma prototype will be running in yangbajing area in real conditions .",
    "mean number of recorded neutrons as a function of eas size ( @xmath19 ) is shown in fig . 3 in comparison with full - scale monte - carlo simulations made using corsika ( with the parameters mentioned above ) and the protoprisma array simulations .",
    "for neutron production we use a formula similar to eq.(1 ) but with a normalization factor taking the our neutron recording efficiency into account .",
    "the efficiency can be estimated as follows : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a probability for neutrons produced in soil ( concrete ) to escape to air @xcite and @xmath22=0.028 is a ratio of total detectors area ( 13.5 @xmath13 ) to the array area ( 484.5 @xmath13)(coverage ) . taking these efficiencies into account one can transform eq.(2 ) to : @xmath23 this relationship was used in the simulations of the experiment . the normalization factor ( c )",
    "was varied to adjust it to the experimental points .",
    "points in fig.3 were obtained with c=0.625 .",
    "agreement is rather well ( note that due to limited statistics for the highest eas energies corresponding calculated points at the right tail are little bit lower ) .",
    "mean number of recorded neutrons as a function of eas size for moscow site .",
    "histogram - experiment , points - simulations.,width=321 ]    as one can see , the mean number of recorded neutrons in the protoprisma experiment is @xmath24 1.6 times lower than expected one",
    ". the reason could be found in the experimental details : detectors are placed inside building ( not in open air ) , the structure of the array is asymmetrical and the detector coverage in 2 clusters are different @xcite and finally , an existence of a large water pool inside the array affects undoubtedly on the neutrons yield making it lower .",
    "in the frames of russian - chinese collaboration monte - carlo eas simulations have been performed and absolute normalization to the experiment has been done .",
    "we obtained rather low yield of neutrons at the protoprisma location in moscow due to specifics of the experiment .",
    "nevertheless , even at such yield and even at sea level it is possible to obtain some new results using the novel type of eas array .",
    "we are looking forward to make such experiment at high altitude in yangbajing region .",
    "it would make us possible to check the method at high altitude , to make calibration using the argo - ybj facilities and to measure real neutron yield in the future experiment site .",
    "the present calculations show that the number of produced neutrons at yangbajing level is by a factor of 10 higher than that at sea level in eas of equal energy .",
