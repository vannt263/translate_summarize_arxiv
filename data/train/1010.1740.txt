    "the cooler synchrotron cosy @xcite at the forschungszentrum jlich in germany can accelerate protons and deuterons up to about 3.7 gev / c .",
    "both , unpolarized and polarized beams are available .",
    "excellent beam quality can be achieved using electron- and/or stochastic cooling .",
    "cosy can be used as an accelerator for external target experiments and as storage ring for internal target experiments .",
    "the strangeness production experiments have been performed at the internal spectrometer anke by the cosy - anke collaboration , at the internal cosy-11 spectrometer by the cosy-11 collaboration , at the external tof facility by the cosy - tof collaboration and at the external big karl spectrometer by the cosy - momo and cosy - hires collaborations .",
    "extensive measurements of kaon - pair production have been performed at several cosy facilities . total and differential",
    "cross sections are now available for a variety of reactions .",
    "the world data set of total cross sections for kaon pair production is shown in fig .",
    "[ kaon - pair ] , left panel , as a function of the excess energy @xmath5 . the @xmath6 reaction ( black symbols )",
    "has been studied by the cosy-11 @xcite and cosy - anke @xcite collaborations at excitation energies between 3 and 108 mev . the closely related reaction @xmath7 ( green )",
    "has also been studied by cosy - anke @xcite .",
    "in addition the reaction @xmath8 ( red ) has been investigated by cosy - anke @xcite using a deuterium cluster - jet as neutron target .",
    "the momentum of the non - observed proton spectator and the excess energy @xmath5 have been reconstructed from the four - momenta of the detected deuteron and kaon pair .",
    "the @xmath9 ( pink ) reaction has been measured by the cosy - momo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 reaction studied by cosy - anke is an ideal isospin zero filter",
    ". it could be sensitive to the production of the scalar meson @xmath11 .",
    "but the total cross section ( blue point ) amounts only to 5  pb @xcite .",
    "the high energy @xmath6 result ( open circle ) has been measured at saturne @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of @xmath12 pairs has been measured by cosy - anke @xcite at three excess energies @xmath13 and 108  mev .",
    "the internal anke spectrometer detects simultaneously slow positive and negative particles in the side detectors and fast positive particles in the forward detector . the spectrum taken at @xmath14  mev ( @xmath15   gev ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ kaon - pair ] , right panel .",
    "all three spectra show a strong peak which is due to the production of the @xmath16 meson which decays with about 50  % into @xmath12",
    ". the prompt @xmath12 distribution can be described by a 4-body phase - space distribution modified by the @xmath1 and @xmath17 final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "all three distributions show a low mass enhancement over the fit curves .",
    "this enhancement has been discussed as a coupled channel effect due to the @xmath18 channel whose threshold ( dashed vertical line ) is about 8 mev above the @xmath12 threshold @xcite .",
    "the important @xmath17 fsi has been observed by comparing the invariant mass distributions of @xmath17 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath19 production changes by an order of magnitude within 50  mev .",
    "the same holds true if one compares @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath17 fsi can be described by assuming an imaginary scattering length of 1.5  fm .    in fig .",
    "[ kaon - pair - phi - tot ] , the left panel shows the total cross sections for @xmath6 as a function of the excess energy @xmath5 .",
    "the data are from cosy-11 @xcite , cosy - anke @xcite and saturne - disto @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve represents a pure 4-body phase - space calculation .",
    "the dot - dashed curve includes the @xmath1 fsi and the solid curve includes the @xmath17 fsi . the right panel shows the total cross section for @xmath0 production as a function of the corresponding excess energy @xmath5 .    the data can not be described by a pure three - body phase - space behavior .",
    "but the inclusion of the @xmath1 fsi is sufficient to reproduce the energy dependence @xcite .",
    "another important result is the angular distribution of the @xmath0 decay into @xmath12 at @xmath22  mev which is a pure @xmath23 distribution in the jackson frame .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 meson is tensor polarized with @xmath24 along the beam axis as expected near threshold due to conservation laws @xcite . comparing the total cross sections for @xmath0- and @xmath25-production at corresponding excess energies",
    "@xcite yields a ratio @xmath26 which is about eight times larger than the prediction @xmath27 @xcite based on the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule .",
    "the @xmath12- and @xmath0-production was also studied by the cosy - momo collaboration at the magnetic spectrograph big karl using the @xmath28 reaction @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass distributions measured at three excess energies , 35 , 40 and 55 mev , can be described by pure phase - space distributions .",
    "effects due to a possible @xmath29 fsi are not visible . in comparison to the @xmath30 reaction @xcite",
    "the @xmath0 peak is less pronounced .",
    "the surprising result of the @xmath31 study is that the the @xmath0 meson is tensor polarized with @xmath32 along the beam axis @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath25 meson is unpolarized in the corresponding reaction @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath26 of total cross sections for @xmath34 and @xmath35 at corresponding excess energies is about a factor 20 larger @xcite than predicted by the ozi - rule @xcite .",
    "exclusive measurements of hyperon production have been performed using the associated strangeness reactions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 by the cosy-11 , cosy - anke and cosy - tof collaborations .",
    "the aim of those measurements is to understand ( i ) the reaction mechanism , ( ii ) to study the effect of @xmath40 resonances and ( iii ) to study the fsi between the outgoing nucleon and hyperon .",
    "the cosy - tof detector enables exclusive measurements with a large solid angle in the laboratory system and almost @xmath41 in the c.m .",
    "recent measurements of the reaction @xmath36 at three bombarding energies @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ dalitz - plot ] in the form of dalitz plots .",
    "the dalitz plots show strong deviations from a homogeneous phase - space distribution .",
    "the data can be described using the isobar model of sibirtsev ( concept outlined in @xcite ) which takes into account the @xmath4 fsi and the contribution of three @xmath40 resonances , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the exclusive measurements of @xmath36 and @xmath37 by cosy - tof provide also differential cross sections @xcite in the cms , jackson and helicity frames , see fig .",
    "[ ang - distr - lambda ] .",
    "in addition , first measurements with polarized proton beams have been performed .",
    "the cosy - tof data will be used for a detailed partial wave analysis by the bonn - gatchina pwa group .    in fig .",
    "[ canu - schulte - wissermann ] @xcite the total cross sections for @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite are shown as a function of the corresponding excess energy @xmath5 .",
    "the dashed curves representing a three - body phase - space @xmath45 dependence describe the @xmath37 data and there is no evidence for a @xmath46 fsi .",
    "however , the @xmath36 data can only be described by including the @xmath4 fsi .",
    "the right panel shows the ratio of the @xmath36 to @xmath37 total cross sections as a function of the excess energy .",
    "the new experimental values from cosy - tof @xcite confirm the general trend towards a ratio of 2.2 measured at high energies @xcite .",
    "the large increase of the ratio towards low energies is well described by the @xmath4 fsi .",
    "the first measurement of the reaction @xmath38 close to threshold has been performed by cosy-11 @xcite , by detecting the @xmath47 in coincidence with the neutron .",
    "the total cross sections at @xmath48 and 60 mev were astonishingly high compared to those for @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the energy dependence of the reaction @xmath38 close to threshold has been studied recently by cosy - anke @xcite by detecting @xmath47 in coincidence with @xmath49 from the decay of the @xmath50 and by detecting @xmath51 coincidences .",
    "in contrast to the cosy-11 results @xcite the total cross sections for @xmath38 are very much smaller ( factor 50 at @xmath52  mev ) and slightly smaller than those for @xmath37 ( @xmath53 ) . the energy dependence can be described by a three - body phase - space calculation @xcite , with no evidence for a @xmath54 fsi .",
    "details can be found in the contribution of yu .",
    "valdau to these proceedings .",
    "a recent determination of the total cross section for @xmath38 at @xmath55 mev from inclusive @xmath47 data by cosy - hires @xcite yielded also a value smaller than expected from the cosy-11 results .",
    "but the result is in conflict with the exclusive measurement by cosy - anke @xcite .",
    "possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 fsi in the reaction @xmath36 has been studied with a high invariant mass resolution by the cosy - hires collaboration @xcite .",
    "the kaons were detected at @xmath58 using the magnetic spectrograph big karl @xcite .",
    "the double differential cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ hires - spectrum ] as a function of the missing mass , i.e. the invariant mass of the @xmath4 system .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by a huge fsi enhancement near the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "a narrow @xmath59 dibaryon resonance predicted near 2100  mev @xcite is not visible .",
    "the data can be described by factorizing the reaction amplitude in terms of a production amplitude and a fsi enhancement factor ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ hires - spectrum ] ) .",
    "taking for the enhancement the inverse jost function yields the spin - averaged effective range parameters of the @xmath4 interaction , i.e. the scattering length @xmath60  fm and the effective range @xmath61  fm .",
    "the dashed curve is the corresponding phase - space distribution without fsi enhancement .",
    "taking the free @xmath4 scattering data @xcite in a combined fit into account yields the possibility to disentangle the spin singlet and triplet effective range parameters of the @xmath4 system @xcite .",
    "however , this result should be considered with respect to the theoretical uncertainties of the jost - function approach @xcite .",
    "a direct determination of the spin singlet and triplet effective range parameters requires polarization measurements as proposed by gasparyan et al .",
    "@xcite and planned by cosy - anke and cosy - tof .",
