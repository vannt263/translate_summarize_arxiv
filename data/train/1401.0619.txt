    "the extraction of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) pion source function using the cartesian surface - spherical harmonic decomposition technique  @xcite in conjunction with model comparisons has permitted the decoupling of the spatio - temporal observable into its spatial and temporal aspects , and the latter into source lifetime and emission duration  @xcite . however , an interpretation of pion correlations in terms of pure hydrodynamic evolution is complicated by significant contributions from later stages of the reaction , such as decays of long - lived resonances and anomalous diffusion from rescattering  @xcite .",
    "a purer probe of the fireball decay can be obtained with kaons , which suffer less contribution from long - lived resonances .",
    "the lower yields , however , make kaon measurements more difficult .",
    "a one - dimensional kaon source image measurement by phenix recently reported an even heavier tail than in pions  @xcite , but this measurement corresponds to a fairly broad range of the pair transverse momentum @xmath0 , which makes the interpretation complicated .",
    "a different aspect of the fireball expansion can be addressed by studying the -dependence of the source size .",

    "we present recent star 3d analyses  @xcite of the shape and -dependent size of the kaon source at mid - rapidity , extracted from bec using low transverse momentum like  sign kaon pairs in @xmath1=200 gev central au+au collisions .",
    "the kaon source shape was analyzed using 4.6 million 020% central events from 2004 , and 16 million 020% central events from 2007 .",
    "the dependent analysis was carried out using 6.6 million 030% central events from 2004 .",
    "the position of the primary vertex along the beam line was constrained to be @xmath2@xmath330 cm .",
    "kaon tracks with a low transverse momentum ( 0.1@xmath3@xmath31.0 gev/@xmath4 ) were selected in the star time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , within a 0.5 t quasi - uniform magnetic field provided by the solenoid surrounding it .",
    "the identification of kaons is based on fractional energy loss @xmath5 . in the source shape analysis , candidates were required to fulfill the kaon hypothesis to the extent of @xmath6 and to be rejected as pions or electrons as @xmath7 or @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the deviation from the normalized distribution of particle type @xmath10 at a given momentum . only pairs with 0.2@xmath3@xmath30.36 gev/@xmath4 were accepted . in the dependent analysis ,",
    "kaon pairs were collected in two bins : 0.2@xmath3@xmath30.36 gev/@xmath4 and 0.36@xmath3@xmath30.48 gev/@xmath4 , with a slightly different kaon selection of @xmath11@xmath3@xmath12@xmath32.0 and @xmath130.5@xmath3@xmath12@xmath32.0 , respectively . since",
    "proton and kaon bands are well separated in both bins , protons are also effectively removed by these cuts .    from an experimental point of view , the 3d correlation function is defined as the ratio of the 3d relative momentum distribution of charged kaon pairs to pairs from mixed events , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the difference between the momenta of the two particles in the pair center - of - mass system ( pcms ) .",
    "the source function @xmath16 is the probability of emitting a pair with a spatial separation @xmath17 .",
    "it is linked to the correlation function via the koonin - pratt equation  @xcite , @xmath18 where the kernel can be expressed in terms of the relative wave function , @xmath19 , and encodes the quantum correlation as well as final state interactions .",
    "source imaging methods numerically invert the above equation without any assumption for the source shape  @xcite . in the 3d case",
    "when the source and correlation functions are handled direction - dependently , the longitudinally co - moving system ( lcms ) is often used : the coordinate axes @xmath20-@xmath21-@xmath22 form a right - handed _ out - side - long _ cartesian coordinate system oriented so that the @xmath22-axis is parallel to the beam direction and @xmath20 points in the direction of the pair total transverse momentum . the correlation and source functions",
    "can be expanded in cartesian harmonics basis elements @xmath23  @xcite , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the solid angle in @xmath28 ( @xmath17 ) space , as @xmath29    the limited statistics of charged kaons prevented us from carrying out an imaging study .",
    "we found , however , that all the moments except for @xmath30=0 and @xmath30=2 are consistent with zero , and that the direction independent correlation function r(q ) agrees with @xmath31 within statistical errors .",
    "therefore a 3d gaussian function , @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] was applied as a trial function for the source , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the characteristic radii of the source in the _ out _ , _ side _ and _ long _ directions , and @xmath35 represents the overall correlation strength .",
    "while @xmath35 may be sensitive to feed - down from long - lived resonance decays , remainder sample contamination or track splitting / merging not removed by purity and track quality cuts , the radii are virtually independent of these effects . technically , the fit is carried out as a simultaneous fit on the even independent moments up to @xmath30=4 , yielding @xmath36=1.7 in the source shape analysis , @xmath36=1.1 and @xmath36=1.3 in the 0.2@xmath3@xmath30.36 gev/@xmath4 and 0.36@xmath3@xmath30.48 gev/@xmath4 bins in the -dependent analysis , respectively .",
    "the shape assumption was tested using a double gaussian trial function and by pushing the fit parameters to the edges of their errors .",
    "other systematic errors were obtained under varying conditions including magnetic field , data collection periods , charge and various sample purity selections .",
    "the systematic errors are largely governed by the limited statistics available .",
    "the source function profiles in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions are shown on figure  [ fig : src ] ( circles ) .",
    "the two solid curves around the gaussian source function profiles represent the error band arising from the statistical and systematic errors on the 3d gaussian fit .",
    "note that the latter becomes important for large @xmath37 values only .",
    "the 3d pion source functions from phenix   @xcite are shown for comparison purposes ( squares ) . while the gaussian radii are similar ,",
    "there is a strinking difference between the source shapes of the two particle species , especially in the _ out _ direction .",
    "note that the phenix and star pion measurements are fully consistent  @xcite .",
    "we have used the star tune of the therminator blast - wave model  @xcite to gain a better understanding of this difference .",
    "the simulation reproduces the source function profiles with emission duration @xmath38=0 ( solid upward - pointing triangles ) .",
    "however , with resonance contribution switched off , therminator gives a distribution that is narrower than the measurement ( empty triangles ) . also note that the pion source function is reproduced with therminator only when non - zero emission duration is assumed  @xcite .",
    "recent simulations with the hydrokinetic model ( hkm )  @xcite show good agreement in the _ side _ direction , although it is slightly over the measurements at larger radii in _ out _ and _ long _ ( downward - pointing triangles ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : kt ] shows the dependence of the gaussian radii in lcms ( @xmath39=@xmath40 ,  @xmath41=@xmath42 and @xmath43=@xmath44 ; @xmath45 is the lorentz boost in the outward direction from the lcms to the pcms frame ) as a function of the transverse mass @xmath46 .",
    "phenix kaon data @xcite are also shown .",
    "the perfect fluid hydrodynamics calculations from the buda - lund model  @xcite and the hkm with glauber initial conditions  @xcite are plotted for comparison purposes . while pions are well described by the buda lund model in the whole interval shown  @xcite ,",

    "no significant non - gaussian tail has been observed .",
    "comparison with the therminator model calculations indicates that , although the transverse extent of the source is similar to pions , the shape and the size in the longitudinal direction is very different .",
    "this can be attributed to resonance decays , but also indicates that kaons and pions may be subject to different freeze - out dynamics . although the gaussian radii follow -scaling in the outward and sideward directions , the scaling appears to be broken in the longitudinal direction .",
    "thus the hydro - kinetic predictions  @xcite are favored over pure hydrodynamical model calculations .",
    "the agreement of hkm simulations with both the source shape and the radii suggests that rescattering in the hadronic phase may also give a non - negligible contribution to the observed source characteristics .",
