    "in this article , the ffs method is used to calculate switching rates for biochemical networks simulated with the gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is an application to chemical reactions of the kinetic monte carlo technique @xcite , first introduced by bortz _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the system is specified by a set of chemical components @xmath4 and a list of allowed reactions , together with their rate constants .",
    "the concentrations @xmath5 of all the components are assumed to be homogeneous in space ; the state of the system at any instant in time is defined by @xmath6 .",
    "the concentrations @xmath6 are propagated stochastically in time , assuming each reaction to be a poisson process .",
    "this time propagation is consistent with the chemical master equation , so that a gillespie simulation is in fact a numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "an important feature of the gillespie algorithm , and of other methods for simulating reaction networks , is that the distribution of states , _",
    "i.e. _ the phase space density , is not known _ a priori _ , but is an output of the simulation .",
    "the phase space density can be obtained by solving the chemical master equation @xcite , but this is generally a demanding task , which is indeed often the motivation for carrying out a gillespie simulation .    transition path sampling ( tps ) has been developed to study rare events in condensed - matter systems . in tps ,",
    "paths belonging to the tpe are obtained by importance sampling in trajectory space .",
    "new paths connecting stable states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are generated by making changes to existing paths .",
    "a new path is accepted or rejected according to its weight in the tpe , which depends on the phase space density of its initial point , as well as the transition probability for each subsequent step . without prior knowledge of the stationary distribution of states ,",
    "however , this approach can not conveniently be applied .",
    "the ffs algorithm which we present in this article differs fundamentally from these methods . rather than generating transition paths one at a time ,",
    "many paths are grown simultaneously , in a series of layers , each of which forms the basis for the next one .",
    "prior knowledge of the stationary distribution of states is not required .",
    "ffs is well suited for convenient and efficient calculation of switching rates in biochemical reaction networks .",
    "the ffs method is not limited to reaction networks : although it can not be used for systems with deterministic dynamics , it is applicable to any stochastic dynamical scheme , such as langevin or brownian dynamics . in this context , it could be used to study rare events in soft condensed matter systems such as protein folding and crystal nucleation , or non - equilibrium processes such as dna or rna stretching .",
    "the expression for the rate constant that is used in the ffs algorithm is the same as that described by van erp _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs between two phase space regions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which must both be `` stable '' in the sense that if the the system is placed outside these regions , it will rapidly evolve in time towards one of them . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are characterized by the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 denotes all co - ordinates of the phase space : in the case of the gillespie algorithm the concentrations of all the system components ) , such that : @xmath10 we also define the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which depend not only on @xmath13 but also on the history of the system : @xmath14 if the system was more recently in @xmath2 than in @xmath3 , and is zero otherwise , while @xmath15 if the system was more recently in @xmath3 than in @xmath2 , and is zero otherwise .",
    "thus @xmath16 for any point on any path in phase space .",
    "the rate constant @xmath17 for transitions from region @xmath2 to region @xmath3 is given by : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the average number of trajectories per unit time entering region @xmath3 , coming directly from @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ which were in @xmath2 more recently than they were in @xmath3 ) .",
    "here , the overbar denotes an average over all phase space points , with their associated histories .",
    "the flux @xmath19 in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is difficult to obtain accurately from a simulation because the system makes few , if any , spontaneous crossings from @xmath2 to @xmath3 in a typical run . to alleviate this problem ,",
    "a parameter @xmath0 is chosen , such that the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be written as : @xmath22 an increasing series of values of @xmath0 , @xmath23 , is then chosen , such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these must constitute non - intersecting surfaces in phase space .",
    "it is not necessary for @xmath0 to be the reaction coordinate , merely that @xmath26 and @xmath27 describe the two stable states ( the exact positioning of these surfaces is not critical ) .",
    "moreover , the system should not reach any @xmath28 before it has crossed the preceding surface @xmath29 .",
    "defining @xmath30 as the probability that a trajectory which passes through @xmath31 coming directly from @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ having been in @xmath2 more recently than it last crossed @xmath29 ) , will subsequently reach the surface @xmath28 before returning to @xmath2 , equation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be written as : @xmath32 expression ( [ eq6 ] ) indicates that the total flux from @xmath2 to @xmath3 is simply the total flux from @xmath2 to @xmath33 , multiplied by the probability that a trajectory reaching @xmath33 from @xmath2 will eventually arrive in @xmath3 , before returning to @xmath2 .",
    "a key point is that @xmath34 can be expressed as the product of the probabilities of reaching each successive interface from the previous one , without returning to @xmath2 : @xmath35 so that @xmath36 expressions ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq6])-([eq8 ] ) are used in the ffs method to calculate @xmath17 .",
    "the first stage of the ffs algorithm involves the choice of the parameter @xmath0 and values for @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath23 . in any one chemical reaction step ,",
    "the system must be able to cross at most one surface @xmath29 .",
    "of course , some choices of @xmath0 will lead to more efficient path sampling than others , but we shall demonstrate in the next sections that for a typical genetic switch , a rather simple definition of @xmath0 gives very satisfactory results .",
    "it is also convenient to define a series of `` sub - surfaces '' @xmath37 , in between each pair of surfaces @xmath29 and @xmath28 , such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    a simulation",
    "is then carried out starting from a point in region @xmath2 .",
    "after an equilibration period , the value of @xmath0 is monitored during a run of length @xmath40 .",
    "whenever the trajectory crosses the surface @xmath33 , coming directly from @xmath2 , a counter @xmath41 is incremented .",
    "if @xmath41 is less than a user - defined number @xmath42 , the phase space co - ordinates of the system are also stored .",
    "the run is then continued . after simulation time @xmath40 ,",
    "one is left with a collection of @xmath42 points at or just beyond @xmath33 , as well as a measurement of the flux @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure is illustrated schematically in figure [ fig1 ] : crossings of surface @xmath33 that are labeled with a black circle contribute to @xmath41 and to the collection of points at @xmath33 . during this run",
    ", it is replaced in @xmath2 , re - equilibrated , and the run continued . ]",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the next stage of the algorithm .",
    "the collection of points at @xmath33 is used to initiate a large number @xmath44 of short simulation trial runs . in each of these trials , a phase space point from the collection at @xmath33 is chosen at random .",
    "this is then used as the starting point for a simulation run , which is continued until the system crosses either @xmath45 or @xmath26 . during this run ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 , @xmath46 , achieved by the system is recorded .",
    "counters @xmath47 for all the sub - surfaces @xmath48 are then incremented by one .",
    "after @xmath44 trials , a good estimate is obtained for @xmath49 , for @xmath50 .",
    "we note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    during the trial procedure outlined above",
    ", one also makes a new collection of @xmath53 points at or just beyond the surface @xmath45 : these are the final phase space points of those trial runs starting from @xmath33 which make it to @xmath45 .",
    "the number @xmath54 of trials must be large enough to generate @xmath53 points at @xmath45 .",
    "the values of @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 for all the subsequent surfaces @xmath57 are chosen by the user : the @xmath56 should be large enough to allow good sampling of the phase space .",
    "the trial run procedure is repeated for each subsequent surface @xmath29 , starting from the collection of @xmath56 phase space points generated by the successful runs from @xmath58 .",
    "eventually @xmath27 is reached , and one is left with a series of histograms @xmath59 , for @xmath60 and @xmath61 . using equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , these histograms can be fitted together to obtain a smooth curve @xmath62 @xcite , the value of which at @xmath63 is @xmath34 .",
    "the rate constant @xmath17 is obtained on multiplying @xmath34 by the flux @xmath64 calculated in the first stage of the algorithm .",
    "it is important to remark that the ffs algorithm does not assume that the distribution of phase space points at the interfaces @xmath65 is equal to the stationary distribution of states .",
    "for the example which we present in this paper , this turns out to have significant consequences for the transition mechanism .",
    "we have applied the ffs method to a simplified model of a genetic toggle switch @xcite .",
    "this model could be regarded as a minimal representation of the lysis - lysogeny switch in bacteriophage @xmath0 @xcite ; a synthetic switch of this type has also been constructed _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model switch consists of two proteins @xmath66 and @xmath67 and their corresponding genes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 form homodimers @xmath68 and @xmath69 which can bind to the dna strand ( here labeled @xmath70 ) and influence transcription . when the dimer @xmath68 is bound to the dna , gene @xmath3 is not transcribed , while @xmath69 , when bound , correspondingly blocks transcription of gene @xmath2 : thus @xmath66 and @xmath67 mutually repress one another s production .",
    "both proteins are also degraded in the monomer form .",
    "we consider two versions of this switch : the `` general '' switch , in which both dimers can bind simultaneously to the dna , forming the species @xmath71 , and the `` exclusive '' switch , in which only one dimer can be bound at any time . the exclusive switch models the case where the operator regions of genes @xmath2 and @xmath3 are overlapping .",
    "the switch is represented by the set of reactions ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "@xmath72    the asterisk indicates that reaction ( [ equationc ] ) happens only for the general switch . here",
    ", we study a symmetrical version of the switch : the rate constants for the reactions on the left and right - hand sides of scheme ( [ eq9 ] ) are identical .",
    "these are all expressed in terms of the protein production rate constant @xmath73 ( for reactions ( [ equationd ] ) and ( [ equatione ] ) ) , so that the unit of time in our calculations is @xmath74 . the rate constants for both the forward and backward dimerization reactions ( [ equationa ] ) are @xmath75 . binding to",
    "the dna occurs with rate constant @xmath75 and dissociation of the complex with rate constant @xmath73 ( reactions ( [ equationb ] ) and ( [ equationc ] ) ) . finally , the rate constant for protein degradation , reactions ( [ equationf ] ) , is @xmath76 .",
    "these parameters are chosen such that in a simulation using the gillespie algorithm , the switch flips between the @xmath66- and @xmath67-rich states at a rate that can be measured by brute - force simulation .",
    "this allows us to test the ffs method .",
    "the model is , of course , highly simplistic : our aim is here to demonstrate the ffs scheme using a simple example .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the results of gillespie simulations of the model genetic switch , in the general ( a ) and exclusive ( b ) cases .",
    "the difference @xmath77 in the total copy numbers of the two proteins , @xmath78 , is plotted as a function of time , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are defined by : @xmath81 of course , @xmath82 for the exclusive switch . noting the different scales on the time axis , the exclusive switch ( b ) has a much lower flipping rate than the general switch ( a ) , in agreement with previous work @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath83 of obtaining a particular value of @xmath77 is shown in the insets , demonstrating clearly that both the general and exclusive switches are bistable .    using long brute - force gillespie simulations ,",
    "the rate constant for the transition from the @xmath66-rich to the @xmath67-rich state was obtained for each switch .",
    "we define phase space region @xmath2 to be where @xmath84 , and region @xmath3 to be where @xmath85 .",
    "the system flips stochastically between the state where @xmath14 and @xmath86 ( _ i.e. _ it was most recently in @xmath2 ) and that where @xmath87 and @xmath15 ( it was most recently in @xmath3 ) .",
    "the times @xmath88 between flipping events are distributed according to a poisson distribution @xmath89}$ ] , where @xmath90 since the switch is symmetrical in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the rate constant @xmath17 can conveniently be measured by fitting the cumulative distribution @xmath91 to the function @xmath92}$ ] .",
    "this procedure resulted in values of @xmath93 for the general switch and @xmath94 for the exclusive switch ( using simulation runs of total length @xmath95 [ 12546 flips observed ] and @xmath96 [ 8808 flips observed ] respectively ) .",
    "we next re - calculated @xmath17 using ffs .",
    "the surfaces @xmath23 , were defined in terms of @xmath77 : _ i.e. _ @xmath97 .",

    "the rate constant @xmath17 is in good agreement with the brute - force simulation result .",
    "an additional test is provided by measuring @xmath145 and @xmath62 using the brute - force runs , to provide a second brute - force estimate for @xmath17 .",

    ", we have analysed the flipping mechanism .",
    "the ffs method generates a collection of switching trajectories ( members of the tpe ) .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a sample of five of these transition paths , for the general switch ( a ) and the exclusive switch ( b ) , plotted as a function of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . to obtain these paths",
    ", we begin with the collection of partial trajectories that reach @xmath27 from @xmath155 and trace these back via the intervening surfaces to @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig5 ] that in the general switch , protein @xmath66 is lost before protein @xmath67 is gained , so that the transition passes through a region of phase space where both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are low .",
    "however , this is not the case for the exclusive switch .",
    "an important quantity associated with transition paths is the committor , @xmath156 .",
    "this is the probability that a new simulation trajectory fired from point @xmath9 will reach region @xmath3 before @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we have measured @xmath157 for points along the trajectories in the transition path ensembles generated using ffs , for the general and exclusive switches .",

    "@xmath151 measures the difference in the number of _ free _ protein molecules : it is similar but not identical to @xmath77 .",
    "a key point is that for the general switch ( figure [ fig6]a(i ) ) , the operator makes two important changes of state , from @xmath159 to @xmath160 early in the transition process , and later from @xmath160 to @xmath161 .",
    "both of these changes influence @xmath150 .",
    "for the exclusive switch ( figure [ fig6]a(ii ) ) , however , the operator is intermittently in states @xmath159 and @xmath161 during the transition",

    ", points are grouped according to their operator state . for each @xmath150 and operator state , the histograms in figure [ fig6](c ) show the probability distribution function @xmath166 .",
    "clearly , for points on a constant @xmath150 surface , the operator state and the number of free molecules are correlated : when @xmath66 is bound to the dna , on average , a larger @xmath167 is required to obtain a particular value of @xmath150 than when @xmath67 is bound .",
    "this shows that @xmath150 , and hence the reaction co - ordinate , depends not only upon the difference in copy number @xmath167 , but also on the state of the operator .",
    "importantly , the plots of figure [ fig6 ] ( b ) and ( c ) are not symmetric on making the transformations @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "this demonstrates that the distribution of transition paths does not follow the steady state phase space density , which is symmetric on interchanging @xmath66 and @xmath67 , since the switch is by construction symmetric @xcite .",
    "it also means that the tpe for the reverse transition , from @xmath3 to @xmath2 , would occupy a different region of phase space , as compared to the tpe for the transition from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( see also supplementary material ) .",
    "the origin of this asymmetry is that the dynamics of our system involves irreversible reactions ( reactions ( [ equationd]-[equationf ] ) ) .",
    "indeed , our system does not satisfy microscopic reversibility .",
    "finally , figure [ fig6 ] clearly demonstrates why the elimination of the operator state @xmath71 for the exclusive switches enhances its stability with respect to that of the general switch . in the general switch ,",
    "as soon as a @xmath69 dimer is produced by some rare fluctuation , it can bind to the dna , switch off the production of @xmath66 and thereby accelerate the flipping of the switch .",
    "for the exclusive switch , however , any @xmath69 dimer that is produced must wait for a second fluctuation by which @xmath68 is released from the dna , before it can bind .",
    "this is the origin of the enhanced stability of the exclusive switch .",
    "this article presents the forward flux sampling ( ffs ) method for the calculation of the rates of rare events in stochastic kinetic simulation schemes such as those used for biochemical reaction networks .",
    "in contrast to previously developed methods for sampling the transition path ensemble @xcite , ffs does not require knowledge of the phase space density .",
    "it is this feature that makes it possible to study rare events in biochemical networks .",
    "our algorithm samples the tpe in a way that is , to our knowledge , new : many paths are grown simultaneously from state @xmath2 to state @xmath3 in a series of layers of partial paths , each layer forming the basis for the next .",
    "the phase space separating stable states @xmath2 and @xmath3 is traversed by the algorithm in a `` ratchet - like '' manner , making the method highly suitable for very rare events , where one - at - a - time path generation tends to be inefficient .",
    "ffs is not applicable to systems whose dynamics is deterministic .",
    "it could be used , however , in combination with any stochastic simulation technique .",
    "this will make it useful for a wide range of problems in soft condensed matter systems , including rare events and non - equilibrium processes .    we have demonstrated our method using stochastic simulations of a simple genetic switch consisting of two mutually repressing genes .",
    "following earlier work @xcite , we compare the case where both protein products can bind simultaneously as dimers to the dna ( the general switch ) , to that where each protein dimer excludes the binding of the other ( the exclusive switch ) .",
    "the results obtained using ffs are in good agreement with those of long brute - force simulations for both switches .",
    "the computational time required for the ffs calculations is far less than for the brute - force simulations , and in addition , does not increase as the rate constant decreases . indeed , using ffs",
    "we could simulate a switch that was too stable to be studied using brute - force calculations . by analysing the transition path ensembles we were able to discover the differences between the flipping mechanisms for the general and exclusive switches .",
    "these allow us to understand the origin of the enhanced stability of the exclusive switch .",
    "the ffs method will be easily applicable to many important biochemical switches , for which prediction of the rates and pathways of switching should lead to a better understanding of the design principles underlying their stability .",

    "<S> the average number of spontaneous transitions from the lysogenic to the lytic state for bacteriophage @xmath0 , for example , is about one in @xmath1 bacterial generations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> new methods are therefore required to model such important but rare events in biochemical networks </S>",
    "<S> .    techniques for the simulation of rare events have been developed in the field of soft condensed matter physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments focus on the transition path ensemble ( tpe ) . for a rare transition between stable states @xmath2 and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , this is the set of all ` reactive ' trajectories leading from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( transition paths ) . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the tpe gives detailed information on the transition mechanism and leads to a prediction of the rate constant . </S>",
    "<S> transition path sampling ( tps ) methods have been developed to generate members of this ensemble in a computationally efficient way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tps has been applied to a wide variety of problems , including chemical reactions in solution , conformational transitions in biopolymers and protein folding @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> biochemical switches , however , differ fundamentally from these problems . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall discuss , in simulations of reaction networks the stationary distribution of states is generally not known _ a priori_. as a result , tps methods can not straightforwardly be applied .    in this article , we present a new scheme for sampling the tpe and computing the rate constant . </S>",
    "<S> this `` forward flux sampling '' ( ffs ) method is efficient and straightforward . it does not require prior knowledge of the phase - space density and can be applied to simulations of biochemical networks . </S>",
    "<S> the method could also be implemented in any other stochastic dynamics scheme . to our knowledge , ffs constitutes a novel approach to sampling the tpe . rather than generating transition paths one at a time ( as in tps ) , </S>",
    "<S> a large number of paths are grown simultaneously from state @xmath2 to state @xmath3 in a series of connected layers .    as an application of the ffs method </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the spontaneous flipping rate of a simple genetic switch , consisting of two mutually repressing genes . </S>",
    "<S> we show , in agreement with previous work @xcite , that the stability of this switch is greatly enhanced when the operator regions for the two genes are mutually exclusive , and that this is due to an important change in the flipping mechanism . </S>"
