    "<S> the simplest scenario for the three known light neutrinos that fits the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficit and a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) picture of the universe requires them to be highly degenerate with @xmath0 1 - 2 ev . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an so(10 ) grand unified model with an s@xmath1-horizontal symmetry that leads naturally to such a scenario . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit numerical analysis of the quark and lepton sector of the model shows that it can lead to desired mass differences to fit all data only for the small angle non - adiabatic msw solution to the solar neutrino puzzle .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3ex = .5 cm = 4ex = = .35 in = .35 in    umd - pp-94 - 95    * an so(10 ) @xmath2 s@xmath1 scenario for naturally degenerate neutrinos * + [ 6 mm ]    * dae - gyu lee and r. n. mohapatra * + _ department of physics , university of maryland + college park , maryland 20742 _ + [ 4 mm ]    in the two recent papers , it has been pointed out by caldwell and one of the authors ( r.n.m.)@xcite that if the existing data on solar@xcite and atmospheric neutrino@xcite deficit is confirmed and if the presently popular mixed dark matter ( mdm)@xcite model of the universe requiring a few ev neutrino as its hot component is taken seriously , then the simplest three - light neutrino ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) mass matrix that fits all data has the following form :    @xmath6    where @xmath7=2 ev , s@xmath8 , s@xmath9 , @xmath10 ev and @xmath11 .2 to .002 ev . </S>",
    "<S> here we have assumed that the solar neutrino puzzle is solved by the small angle msw ( mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein)@xcite solution@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note the high degree of degeneracy among the three neutrino species . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate implication of this is that if the neutrinos are majorana particles , the neutrinoless double beta decay would be measurable in the current generation experiments involving @xmath12@xcite and @xmath13@xcite thereby providing a test of the degenerate neutrino hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> it is then perhaps not premature to search for gauge models which can generate this highly degenerate neutrino spectrum@xcite in a technically natural manner . </S>",
    "<S> such degeneracy is suggestive of a horizontal symmetry , which will contain all three neutrinos in one irreducible representation . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry however must be broken in the charged lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> since the see - saw mechanism@xcite generally connects the neutrino masses with the charged fermion masses , the horizontal symmetry breaking in the charged fermion sector will cause mass differences between the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> such mass differences are of course required and from equation ( 1 ) , we see that these must be very tiny . </S>",
    "<S> a simple scaling argument then says that the see - saw scale must be in the range of @xmath14 gev or so . </S>",
    "<S> such mass scales have their natural place in grand unified theories and we will consider so(10 ) as the flavor grand unifying theory in order to understand the required neutrino spectrum .    turning now to the horizontal symmetry , an obvious choice is to consider it to be @xmath15 as has been done in several recent papers@xcite . in this letter , we consider a somewhat more economical group based on the permutation group @xmath16 as our horizontal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the symmetry is softly broken so that there is no domain wall problem . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in this model , the fermion sector is completely specified by fifteen arbitrary parameters , twelve of which are fixed by the charged fermion sector ( i.e. by six quark masses , three ckm angles and three charged lepton masses ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the neutrino mass matrix is then such that only the small angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem ,    before presenting the details of the model , let us first review the basic strategy given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that when the conventional see - saw mechanism for neutrino - masses@xcite is implemented in gauge models such as so(10 ) or the left - right symmetric models , it gets modified to the following form@xcite @xmath17 where    @xmath18    @xmath19 is the scale of su(2)@xmath20-breaking and @xmath21 is breaking scale of parity . therefore , unless special care is taken to break parity symmetry at a scale higher than the su(2)@xmath20 or u(1)@xmath22 , @xmath23 ( since @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light neutrino masses are then given by : @xmath25    recall that the conventional see - saw formula omits the first term ( which , as just mentioned , is justified only under special circumstances ) leading to an approximate quadratic scaling relation between neutrino and up - quark mass ( or in some instances charged lepton masses ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will however keep both the terms in the present discussion . </S>",
    "<S> now notice that if due to some symmetry reasons , @xmath26 , then a degenerate neutrino spectrum emerges .    before discussing the fermion masses , </S>",

    "<S> let us now turn to the implication of s@xmath37-symmetry for the charged fermion and neutrino masses , which is the main contribution of this paper . </S>",

    "<S> it has irreducible representations with dimension @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . </S>",

    "<S> we also assume a softly broken u(1)@xmath48 symmetry so that the complex @xmath49 s have only one coupling to the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath44 s therefore have vev s given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> turning now to the @xmath52 s , we choose only the ( mass)@xmath53 of @xmath54 negative and large so that the ( @xmath55 ) submultiplet of it ( the numbers denote representation under the group @xmath31 ) acquire a vev @xmath56 that breaks @xmath31 down to the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two @xmath52 s ( @xmath57 ) have large (  @xmath58 ) positive masses so that their ( * 2,2,15 * ) components acquire induced vev s of order of the electroweak scale without any fine tuning@xcite due to the presence of s@xmath59 u(1)@xmath48 invariant terms such as @xmath60 in their potential ( where i=1,2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a term of the form @xmath61 also induces non - zero vev s to the ( * 2,2,15 * ) submultiplets of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote these @xmath52-vev s by @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath54 coupling in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) leads after symmetry breaking to the degenerate neutrino masses .    </S>",
    "<S> the charged fermion and dirac - neutrino mass matrices can now be written as follows . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 where @xmath66 where @xmath67 s and @xmath68 s are products of type @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar matrices can be written down for @xmath71 and @xmath72 by replacing @xmath67 s by @xmath73 s , @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath68 s by @xmath76 s . </S>",
    "<S> this way of writing makes it clear that there are a total of 18 parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can choose a basis in which the up - quark mass matrix is diagonal , thereby getting rid of three parameters and we are left with fifteen parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we will now fit these parameters so that the six quark masses , three charged lepton masses and three ckm angles are reproduced . in order to proceed , </S>",
    "<S> we first extrapolate these parameters from the electro - weak scale to the scale @xmath77 , where their values are :    @xmath78    we have chosen all masses to be positive . </S>",
    "<S> we do the fitting as follows . in the basis where @xmath79 is diagonal </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the first choice leads to six constraints on the original ( before choosing the up - quark basis ) nine parameters leaving three arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> we choose them to be @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the @xmath84 equation leaves three arbitrary parameters chosen to be @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . the @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> are then determined by three equations that relate them to @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 which of course are easily expressed in terms of the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath94 is then completely determined . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalizing it as usual i.e. @xmath95 , where @xmath96 diag(@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , the three angles that parameterize @xmath97 are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , note that , in the basis in which @xmath79 is diagonal , @xmath98 mixing arises predominantly from the ( @xmath99 ) sector due to the fact that @xmath100 is block diagonal and fitting @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 leads a prediction for @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for negative @xmath102 , two sets of solutions for the mixing matrix @xmath103 correspond to the correct charged lepton masses . </S>",
    "<S> only one of them leads to the desired @xmath104-@xmath4 mixing angle and we choose this one ; the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 not fixed by the up - quark sector , are then varied to obtain the required mass difference squares between @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 to fit the data .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now briefly discuss the dependence of our solutions on the three parameters @xmath81,@xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> requiring @xmath108 implies that , @xmath109 ; if we further assume that the non - degenarate part of the contribution to the neutrino masses have a hierarchical structure between the first and the second generation leading to @xmath110 , this leads to @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown the dependence of the @xmath104- @xmath4 mass difference on @xmath82 for the above choices of @xmath83 and @xmath81 and we see that the desired range comes only for @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> we give below the detailed solution for the neutrino masses and mixings for this case . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have written @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the direct @xmath115 contribution . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath116 and    @xmath117    note that , for @xmath118 gev and @xmath119 , this predicts @xmath120 ev@xmath53 for @xmath121 2 ev , @xmath122 ev@xmath53 , which are in the range required to solve both the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficit for the values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 given above . in particular , we wish to note the preference of theory for the small angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite interesting in view of the recent conclusions@xcite that the large angle msw solutions have a discouragingly large @xmath125-fit .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to remark that our solutions do not depend on the choice of sign for the up quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that we lose the desired values of masses and mixings if we choose @xmath126 to be negative for both signs of the cabibbo angle .    in conclusion , we have constructed an so(10 ) @xmath2 s@xmath37 model , which leads to a degenerate neutrino mass scenario including correct mixing angles required to fit atmospheric and solar neutrino data as well as the hot dark matter in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> a critical test of the model is the observation of a non - zero signal in neutrinoless double data decay in the current generation of @xmath127ge and @xmath128te experiments . </S>",
    "<S> also our model prefers only the small angle msw solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , a result which is already indicated in recent analyses and will surely be tested once more data accumulates .    10    d.o . </S>",
