    "a quantum quench ( or non - adiabatic change in the system hamiltonian ) of an isolated many - body system generally leads to a state that is far from equilibrium . in particular , a thermal state @xmath0 does not generally evolve into a canonically distributed ( gibbs ) state by unitary dynamics under a different hamiltonian @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there is much interest in the study of these highly excited quenched states , especially when the quench is done about a quantum critical point , because of the possibility of observing universal phenomena @xcite , dynamical phase transitions @xcite , quantum revivals or thermalization @xcite , and singular behavior in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "also , when the quench involves interaction parameters that couple different subsystems within a system , non - trivial correlations and entanglement may be generated between these subsystems @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been suggested that quench - based protocols may be used to measure entanglement entropies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when a quantum quench is viewed as a thermodynamic process , it can lead to dynamically - generated quantum fluctuations that are described by generalized fluctuation relations @xcite .",
    "for example , the work done on a quenched isolated system is described by a probability distribution whose characteristic function takes the form of a two - time correlation function @xcite .",
    "this correlation function can be expressed in terms of free energy differences of a system in effective thermal equilibrium @xcite .",

    ", we continue previous investigations on the work done in quenched quantum chains .",
    "in particular , our emphasis is on the theoretical analysis of the statistics of work done in arbitrary quenches of the ground and thermal states of the xy model following the formalism developed in ref .",
    "work statistics have been studied in other quenched systems such as the transverse field ising model @xcite , the xxz model @xcite and integrable field theories @xcite , luttinger liquids @xcite , low - dimensional quantum gases @xcite , critical spin - boson models @xcite , and optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies have recently been complemented by experimental interferometric measurements of the probability distribution of work done on quenched gases of two - level systems @xcite .",
    "such measurements have also been viewed from a quantum information perspective , where the measurement of work done is considered as a generalized quantum measurement ( a positive operator valued measure or povm ) @xcite .",
    "the results of this study can be divided into two main parts . in the first part ,",
    "we report a calculation of the average work done in an isolated quenched xy chain ( section [ averagework ] ) .",
    "when the system is initially in a canonically distributed state @xmath2 , the quench is associated with the production of a so - called irreversible entropy @xmath3 , which may be interpreted as a measure of the irreversibility of the quench @xcite .",
    "indeed , in an instantaneous quench @xmath4 can be expressed mathematically as the relative entropy ( kullback - leibler divergence ) between the probability distributions of work done in the forward quench protocol and the reversed protocol ( with initial and final hamiltonians swapped ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath4 has been recently proposed as an experimentally accessible quantity that may be used to establish the arrow of time in isolated quantum systems @xcite .",
    "we give an exact solution for @xmath3 for arbitrary sets of pre- and post - quench hamiltonian parameters and examine sharp increases in irreversible entropy production about quantum criticality .",
    "second , we calculate the fluctuation in the work done in an arbitrary ground state quench and obtain exact contour integral representations in the thermodynamic limit ( section [ workfluc ] ) .",
    "we find that the work fluctuation is generally not an analytic function of the pre - quench ( but not post - quench ) hamiltonian parameters along the quantum critical lines .",
    "for quenches done on thermally mixed states , a numerical analysis reveals that this non - analytic behavior is weakened in the sense that singular behavior begins to appear in higher - order derivatives .",
    "these results suggest that quench protocols may be used to locate quantum critical points in systems with unknown phase diagrams .",
    "past investigations of quenches in the one - dimensional xy model have focused on the time evolution ( quench dynamics ) of correlation functions @xcite , the loschmidt echo @xcite , defect production @xcite , and entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical analyses of the work statistics have been performed for quenches along the transverse field ising line of the xy model @xcite , and we therefore emphasize in this paper the effects of anisotropy on the average work and work fluctuations .",
    "still , we are able to report some new exact formulas for the average work and work fluctuation along the ising line to complement these previous studies .",

    "we study how field quenches are modified by anisotropy and how the behavior of anisotropy quenches depend on whether the transverse field is above or below the critical threshold .",
    "first , we consider small transverse field quenches @xmath82 at fixed anisotropy and low temperature @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ sfig : fieldquench ] shows how the irreversible entropy is pronounced for quenches in the vicinity of the critical field due to the increased amount of irreversible work done in defect production as the energy gap closes @xcite .",
    "accounting for anisotropy in the xy model reveals additional features of @xmath3 than previously observed along the ising line .",
    "for instance , the production of irreversible entropy is greatest about the multicritical points at the intersection of the xx and critical field lines ( seen as the peaks at @xmath84 of the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ sfig : fieldquench ] ) . also , we observe the different effect of anisotropy on small @xmath85 field quenches deep in the ferromagnetic @xmath28 and paramagnetic phases @xmath86 . in the former , where ferromagnetic order is established along the @xmath6- and @xmath7-directions , increasing anisotropy from @xmath87 decreases the irreversible entropy production , while in the latter increasing anisotropy increases @xmath88 .",
    "second , we take a look at the case of anisotropy quenches @xmath89 at fixed field and low temperature @xmath83 . in fig .  [",
    "sfig : anisotropyquench ] we see that irreversible entropy production peaks when the quench is done about the isotropic xx line .",
    "however , this peak is most prominent when the quench is done within the critical region @xmath28 , again mirroring the increased dissipated work at criticality .",
    "however , unlike the previous case of field quenches , less irreversible entropy is produced when the anisotropy quench is done about the multicritical points ( @xmath90 ) than when done across the critical xx line at low transverse fields @xmath28 .",
    "that is , in a given anisotropy quench about the isotropic xx region , an increasing transverse field suppresses the production of excitations .     for small magnitude",
    "ground state quenches @xmath91 along the @xmath92 line .",
    "three critical lines are crossed , which correspond to peaks in the irreversible work .",
    "these peaks become sharper as the temperature is decreased to zero ( the inset shows the peak at @xmath93 ) . ]    _ _ non - zero temperature__in the limit of infinite temperature @xmath94 the irreversible entropy @xmath3 vanishes trivially as @xmath95 and @xmath96 vanish individually . in this extreme case ,",
    "the pre- and post - quench states are both maximally mixed and have zero relative entropy .",
    "in contrast , when the pre - quench state is prepared at a finite non - zero temperature , the temperature dependence of the average work and free energy change are difficult to study analytically because of their hyperbolic dependence on the energy spectrum @xmath97 .",
    "still , the integrals for the irreversible entropy and irreversible work per spin are readily evaluated by quadrature methods and we performed empirical studies of the temperature dependence of these quantities .",
    "for instance , in the case of small magnitude quenches @xmath91 beginning at @xmath92 , peaks in the irreversible work per spin @xmath98 can be examined as three critical lines are crossed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irrentropy ] ) . as in the case of quenches along the ising line @xcite ,",
    "these peaks are caused by increased defect production as the excitation gap closes at criticality .",
    "additionally , it turns out that the irreversible work per spin @xmath99 saturates to a constant value in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature , that is , it does not diverge at any temperature .",
    "this result implies that the total irreversible entropy , like a thermodynamic entropy , scales extensively at all finite temperatures @xmath100 as @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , for these small magnitude quenches , the irreversible work vanishes at high fields and large anisotropy at all temperatures as the relative parameter changes @xmath101 and @xmath102 become smaller @xcite .     along the @xmath92 line , the irreversible work peaks at some non - zero temperature @xmath103 away from criticality ( top ) .",

    "[ fig : irrentropy ] the irreversible work per spin @xmath99 does not have a monotonic dependence on temperature .",
    "since the irreversible work is the difference of two quantities ( the average work done and effective free energy change ) with different temperature dependence , it is reasonable to anticipate such non - monotonic behavior .",
    "indeed , observations from several numerical evaluations of the irreversible work reveals that @xmath99 peaks at some non - zero temperature @xmath103 away from criticality . for several small magnitude quenches , including the previous case along the @xmath92 line ( fig .",
