    "with the possibility to perform transport measurements on nano- down to atomic - scale junctions using mechanically - controllable break - junctions  @xcite or scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite various fundamental questions on electron transport as well as practical problems concerning device functionality have arisen . with shrinking system size",
    "the junctions have become considerably smaller than the mean free path of a transmitted electron , reaching the ballistic transport regime . in this regime",
    "various effects such as the geometric arrangement of the atoms , the chemical composition , the magnetic order , vibrations , correlation effects , or the magnetic anisotropy can play an important role due to the reduced coordination number of the participating atoms . in the context of spin - dependent transport , for example , there is a strong interest in understanding how the spin - valve effect scales to systems of atomic- or molecular - scale  @xcite . in nanoscale junctions ,",
    "new transport effects can also arise such as the ballistic anisotropic magneto - resistance ( bamr)@xcite . in order to successfully address such issues a theoretical description needs to properly take into account the electronic structure of the system which is typically obtained by first - principles methods based on density functional theory .",

    "[ fig : tgeo ] , resulting in the famous landauer conductance formula@xcite .",
    "basically two different groups of techniques have been developed to solve the transport problem : wave - function and green s function ( gf ) based methods which are equivalent in case of non - interacting charge carriers@xcite . among the wave function based methods the transmission through such a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) system can be calculated by means of the transfer matrix method@xcite , solving the lippmann - schwinger equation@xcite , or by wave function matching@xcite .",
    "the gf methods are usually based on keldysh , kadanoff and baym s non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf)@xcite . beyond the standard non - interacting electron approach ,",
    "there has been work incorporating e.g.  inelastic scattering on vibrations@xcite or treating correlation effects through self - energies@xcite .",
    "an alternative way of calculating quantum transport is by using the kubo approach as formulated by baranger and stone@xcite , relating the current to the dynamical polarization@xcite .",
    "based on these three general approaches all codes differ in the way the electronic structure is described . in the first implementations based on density functional theory ( dft ) ,",
    "the electrodes were treated as jellium which were coupled to the scattering region  @xcite .",
    "large systems up to devices can be described using semi - empirical tight - binding methods for the electronic structure @xcite while approaches using dft for both the description of the electrodes via self - energies and the scattering region promise the highest accuracy@xcite .    among these implementations",
    "various dft methods have been applied .",
    "transport codes based on green s functions rely on a localized basis set limiting this approach to basis sets of numerical orbitals such as gaussians@xcite , localized orbitals@xcite , or wavelets@xcite .",
    "the application of flexible and accurate plane - wave dft methods for transport calculations is usually realized in connection with the scattering approach for the conductance  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the efficient gf method for the transport calculation can be used if the extended states in the plane - wave expansion are mapped onto maximally localized wannier functions@xcite ( mlwfs ) .",
    "this approach combines plane - wave calculations with the use of a minimal basis set suitable for quantum transport calculations@xcite .",
    "when one is dealing with low - dimensional systems and subtle band structure effects such as spin - orbit coupling the accuracy of electronic structure description becomes crucial .",
    "therefore , the application of a highly precise all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave code is desirable . to our knowledge",
    "no such dft transport scheme has been reported and only a few codes allow to incorporate spin - orbit coupling@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a method to calculate transport through 1d nanoscale structures following the landauer - bttiker approach .",
    "the underlying electronic structure of the studied system is obtained from dft within the 1d version@xcite of the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method ( flapw ) , as implemented within the fleur code.@xcite the 1d - flapw method is specifically tailored to treat 1d structures avoiding supercell calculations : the periodicity is explicitly taken into account only along the nanostructure s axis ( @xmath3-axis in the following ) , while the wavefunctions in the vacuum surrounding the system are forced to obey an exponential decay in - plane.@xcite since the flapw wavefunctions are intrinsically delocalized in real space we perform a mapping of the electronic structure of the system onto a set of localized wannier functions ( wfs ) , which allows to solve the transport problem in real space efficiently .",

    "we use and compare two different sets of wfs , namely , the maximally - localized wannier functions ( mlwfs),@xcite which are uniquely defined by fulfilling the condition of maximal localization in real space , and the so - called first - shot wannier functions ( fswfs),@xcite being much easier to obtain computationally and although non - unique , still capable of describing the transport properties of a system correctly in many cases . a special approximation we include in our transport scheme is the so - called `` locking technique '' , which allows to use separately calculated leads and scattering regions and to combine those into one quantum transport calculation , achieving an accurate treatment of leads and scattering region at reduced computational cost .    as a first application we have calculated the electronic structure and the ballistic transport properties of a non - magnetic pt monowire with a single stretched bond in the middle of the chain which acts as a source of scattering . for this rather simple system",
    "we demonstrate the quality of our mlwfs and fswfs , the locking technique to obtain the hamiltonian of the open system , and show the possibility of decomposing the transmission function in terms of orbital symmetry .",
    "we further investigate the influence of spin - orbit - coupling ( soc ) on the transmission of the pt wire .",
    "we find a substantial change of the conductance of one quantum of conductance at the fermi level for a perfect wire due to the strength of soc in @xmath4-transition metals such as pt .    in order to include the effect of large spin - polarization we have chosen a ferromagnetic co monowire with a single stretched bond , a prototypical magnetic system , and calculate the magnetoresistance from the conductance in a parallel and antiparallel alignment of the co electrodes .",
    "we obtain a rapid decrease of the magnetoresistance with the separation between the two co monowires which is due to the fast decay of transmission from the highly spin - polarized localized states of @xmath5 and @xmath6symmetry .",
    "finally , we have studied scattering from a single impurity atom in a monowire due to soc .",
    "we have chosen two configurations : ( i ) a non - magnetic pt atom in a ferromagnetic co wire and ( ii ) a magnetic co atom in a non - magnetic pt wire . in both cases ,",
    "we have compared the conductance obtained in the scalar - relativistic approximation and upon including soc .",
    "we find a strong influence of soc on the transmission due to the induced splitting of bands .",
    "in addition , the conductance depends sensitively on the magnetization direction in the system being either along the wire axis or perpendicular to it .",
    "while in case ( ii ) the resulting ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance displays values of 7 % due to spin - orbit interaction mediated scattering into both spin - channels for the symmetry breaking out - of - chain quantization axis , in case ( i ) the values of bamr reach as much as 100% , reflecting the giant value of the ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance of the pure co chain .",

    "the aim of the approach introduced here is to combine the accuracy and speed of state - of - the - art dft electronic structure calculations based on the one - dimensional version of the flapw method as implemented in the ` fleur ` code,@xcite and the capability of the negf - formalism described above to treat the whole transport problem in an efficient way . especially for transport phenomena driven by magnetism or spin - orbit coupling ( soc )",
    "a precise description of the electronic structure is necessary .",
    "typical systems currently under scrutiny in experiment include geometries with a low coordination number which favors magnetism and gives rise to strong soc due to unquenching of the orbital moment.@xcite    the major problem in combining an lapw or a plane - wave based electronic structure method with the real - space transport schemes lies in the fact that normally several hundreds of delocalized basis functions per atom are used in such codes in order to achieve the required accuracy .",
    "in our implementation we use the machinery of wannier functions ( wfs ) , constructed out of flapw wavefunctions,@xcite which proved to be an efficient connection between the two , conceptually independent , computational methods .",
    "the main advantage in such a `` link '' can be attributed to two factors : ( i ) using the gauge freedom of wannier functions they can be enforced to be rather localized in real space , and ( ii ) an `` exact '' mapping of the _ ab initio _",

    "on the other hand , for a pt impurity in a co chain we find that the presence of an impurity , although reducing somewhat the bamr of the pure co chain , still leads to values of bamr of about 100% , which originates from hybridization between the @xmath85 and @xmath88 states moderated via soc by the direction of the magnetization .",
