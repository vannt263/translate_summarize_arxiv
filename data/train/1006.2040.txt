    "one intuitive but powerful picture of this effect represents pulses subject to a spatial compression which locally increases the power density @xcite , pretty much as cars in a highway get closer to each other as their speed is decreased .",
    "the dependence of nonlinearity on group velocity has been recently observed in phcw for third harmonic generation @xcite and for spm and three photon absorption @xcite .",
    "efficient four - wave mixing ( fwm ) was reported recently in 1.3 mm long , iii - v semiconductor phcw @xcite , with a conversion efficiency comparable to that of about 1 m - long highly nonlinear fiber @xcite and about 2 cm - long chalcogenide fiber photonic wire @xcite .",
    "that result confirms the theoretical prediction @xcite of enhanced ( fwm ) on the basis of the square group index scaling factor .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that a simple square group index scaling , to model the fwm enhancement , does not actually take into account several fundamental features of the phenomenon .",
    "the first feature is that the group index in the waveguide is a function of frequency and , therefore , it is not the same for the various waves involved in the fwm .",

    "moreover , the modal superposition of the interacting fields must be also considered . in phcws",
    "this overalap is a function of frequency ; in particular , as the frequency approaches the bandgap , the mode spreads into the hole region as shown in fig .",
    "[ sfig:1 ] , where the intensity distribution of the electric field within a cell of the phcw is shown at three different wavelengths . finally , the phcws mode is not constant but periodic along the propagation direction and so , differently from other photonic waveguides ( slabs , fibers etc . ) , the careful determination of the nonlinear effective coefficients is more complicated @xcite .    in this paper , an accurate calculation of all nonlinear effective coefficients necessary to evaluate the fwm interaction in the sl regime of a phcw ,",
    "is carried out .",
    "the derivation is performed through a perturbation approach , similarly to @xcite , directly from maxwell s equations .",

    "we demonstrate rigorously the explicit dependence of the nonlinear enhancement on the group index and that in four - wave mixing ( where the fields involved have different group indexes ) the dispersive nature is rigorously accounted for by the geometric mean of the group indexes of the modes involved .",
