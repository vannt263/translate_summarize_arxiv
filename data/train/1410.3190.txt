    "precision control of the geometrical features , such as the size , layout , morphology , at the nanometer scale are important in realizing valuable functionalities @xcite . in this context , the nanophotonics fabrication - principles and techniques have been providing interesting and important light - assisted , self - controlled nanostructures ; nanoparticle array formation @xcite , light emission from indirect - transition - type semiconductors ( such as silicon ) @xcite , appearances of photosensitivity at wavelengths longer than the long - wavelength cutoff @xcite , etc . in these light - assisted material formations",
    ", while elemental physical processes indeed involve optical near - field interactions at the nanometer - scale , the system is open to environment and thus is accompanied with energy flow and environmental fluctuations . for these systems ,",
    "stochastic modeling @xcite is very useful in order to obtain deeper understandings of the underlying physical processes as well as to gain design principles for future devices and systems @xcite . in the present paper ,",

    "figure [ fig : device1 ] shows the cross - sectional structure of the photovoltaic device of poly-(3-hexyl thiophene ) ( p3ht ) and zno sandwiched by ag and indium tin oxide ( ito ) electrodes . a p3ht layer ( about 50 nm thick ) and a zno layer ( about 100 nm thick ) are used as p - type and n - type semiconductors , respectively , and an ito film ( about 200 nm thick ) and an ag film ( a few nanometers thick ) are used as two electrodes .",
    "this multi - layered film with an area of 30 mm@xmath2 is deposited on a sapphire substrate in series . at the last stage of the fabrication process of the multi - layered device",
    ", ag was deposited on the ag thin film .",
    "the ag is deposited by radio frequency ( rf ) sputtering under light illumination while applying a reverse bias dc voltage , @xmath3 v , to the p3ht / zno p - n junction .",
    "the wavelength of the incident light is 670 nm , which is longer than the cut - off wavelength @xmath4 nm of p3ht . under light illumination , optical near - fields",
    "are locally generated on the ag surface .",
    "they induce coherent phonons and form a coupled state with them , which is called a _ virtual exciton - phonon - polariton _",
    "@xcite or the _ dressed - photon - phonon ( dpp ) _",
    "@xcite . if the dpp field extends to the p - n junction , the two - step excitation process of electrons occurs ( see @xcite and sec.7.2.1 of @xcite ) and then electron - hole pairs are created at the p - n junction . as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : device2 ] , by the reverse bias voltage , the electrons and holes are separated from each other .",
    "the positive holes are attracted to the ag film , which make the ag film be positively charged .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that due to randomness in ag deposition process by rf sputtering , the density of ag deposits will spatially fluctuate .",
    "since the optical near - fields are generated by short - ranged light - matter interaction , the optical near - fields will also become spatially inhomogeneous in the film . in the local area of the ag surface , where the optical near - field is effectively induced ,",
    "more positive holes are generated and transferred into the area .",
    "in such an area , which is more positively charged than other areas , the subsequent deposition of ag will be suppressed , since the sputtering ag is positively ionized by passing through the argon plasma used for rf sputtering .",
    "such a feedback mechanism induced by optical near - fields will lead to the unique and nontrivial granular structure of the ag film and such a self - controlled pattern formation was indeed observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "ion on the electrode is suppressed by positive charge accumulated in the ag clusters on the surface . ]",
    "naruse et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a stochastic cellular automaton model on a square lattice @xcite such that each cell has one of the two values 0 and 1 , which represents a vacancy and an occupation by an ag grain , respectively .",
    "time evolution of ag clusters in random deposition of ag@xmath5 grains on a lattice has been numerically simulated .",
    "it was assumed in their model that the repulsive force acting on an ag@xmath5 grain when it is deposited on a site in the lattice is simply proportional to the total number of occupied sites in the eight neighbors ( _ i.e. _ the moore neighborhood in the square lattice ) .",
    "this model works well as a minimal model for the inhomogeneous pattern formation of ag film on an electrode of the photovoltaic device , while a role of spatially inhomogeneous charge - distribution due to the heterogeneous effect of optical near - fields was not clarified .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose a nonequilibrium statistical - mechanics model on an @xmath6 square lattice @xmath7 , in which two kinds of stochastic variables at each site @xmath8 evolve in discrete time @xmath9 ; the number of deposited grain on the site @xmath10 and the amount of charge per site @xmath11 .",
    "these two variables are dynamically coupled as explained below .",
    "it is known that the effective potential of optical near - field is well - described by a yukawa function of a distance @xmath12 , @xmath13 . here the interaction range @xmath14 is proportional to the size of the matter which generates the optical near - field under light illumination @xcite . in the present situation , the range @xmath14 will be approximately equal to the size @xmath15 of ag - clusters . hence growth of sufficiently large clusters",
    "is required in order to realize the situation such that the optical near - fields generated on the ag surface reach the p - n junction and electron - hole pairs are created ( see fig.[fig : device2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the charge increment of a cluster of ag - deposited sites depends on the cluster size @xmath15 , which is a functional of @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce a characteristic size @xmath17 of the cluster at which the charge increment of a cluster caused by the optical near - fields is maximized .",
    "moreover , we assume existence of a characteristic size - variation @xmath18 such that if the cluster size @xmath15 deviates from @xmath17 by much larger than @xmath19 , that is , if @xmath20 , then the effect of the optical near - fields for charging cluster becomes very small .",
    "these assumptions are due to the basic property of dpps , the optical near - fields coupled with phonons , called the _ size - dependent resonance _ , and here we use the gaussian function @xmath21 \\label{eqn : f2}\\ ] ] to represent such size dependence ( see fig.2.6 in sec.2.2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in our numerical simulation , we perform exact calculation of long - ranged repulsive coulomb interaction between the ag@xmath5 grain being deposited on a site and positively charged ag clusters formed on the surface .",
    "the main result of our numerical simulation of the model is that , when the lattice size @xmath22 is large but finite , there are following two distinct mesoscopic states .",
    "state a : if ag clusters on the surface are formed with a proper size @xmath15 such that @xmath23 , then the optical near - fields are induced effectively to increase the charge of clusters and hence the total positive charge on the surface increases monotonically in time .",
    "it causes strong suppression of further deposition of ag@xmath5 grains on the surface and then the deposition will be stopped . as a result , a nontrivial and unique ag film is formed .",
    "state b : if sizes of ag clusters on the surface tend to deviate from @xmath17 by more than @xmath19 , the optical near - fields are not induced effectively . in this case the charge on surface will be saturated at a low level , and the suppression of deposition of ag@xmath5 grains on the surface remains weak .",
    "hence the random deposition process will continue without any self - control and ag film formation is rather trivial ; as long as laser light is irradiated the density of ag grains on the surface gradually increases .",
    "we will show that if we change some parameters of model , for instance , a parameter @xmath0 which denotes the incident light power per site , then there occurs a transition from state b to state a , and then the self - controlled formation of ag file is realized .",
    "we remark that in the real experiments the p - n junction was reversely biased with a fixed voltage ( @xmath24 v )",
    ". therefore , the positive charge on the ag surface is bounded and it will be saturated . in order to simplify the model , however , we do not take into account such an effect in the present study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] the setting of the present model , the algorithm of processes , and the quantities which we will calculate are explained .",
    "the results of numerical simulations are given in sec.[sec : results ] .",
