    "at present the theory of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) is well developed and its predictions are in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "we recall that the sr is created by charged particles , which are moving with velocities @xmath0 along circles of radius @xmath1 in an uniform magnetic field @xmath2 , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the particle energy , @xmath5 is the charge , and @xmath6 the rest mass .",
    "the radiation frequencies @xmath7 are multiples of the synchrotron frequency @xmath8 the spectral sr - intensity ( sr - intencity for a fixed radiation frequency ) has maximum for harmonics with @xmath9 .",
    "two limiting cases , the non - relativistic ( @xmath10 ) and  the relativistic limits ( @xmath11 ) , are of particular interest .  in the non - relativistic case ,",
    "only the first harmonic @xmath12 is effectively emitted .",
    "the sr - intensity has a maximum in the direction of the magnetic field . in the relativistic case , the integral sr - intensity ( spectral sr - intensity summed over the spectrum )",
    "is concentrated in the orbit plane within a small angle @xmath13  @xmath14  .",
    "thus , as the electron energy increases , the integral sr - intensity tends to be concentrated in the orbit plane .",
    "any polarization component of the integral sr - intensity has the same behavior .",
    "these results were first derived in the framework of classical theory .",
    "consideration in the framework of quantum theory does not change essentially results of the classical analysis , since quantum corrections are small @xcite",
    ".    however , one ought to say that the analysis of angular dependence of the spectral and the integral sr - intensities was not done before in detail .",

    "ii we analyze in detail angular dependence of the integral sr - intensity . in sect .",
    "we study peculiarities of the angular dependence of the first harmonics sr .",
    "studying spectral sr- intensities ( see sect.iv ) , we have discovered their unexpected angular behavior , completely different from that of the integral sr - intensity .",
    "namely , one can see that for any given synchrotron frequency , maxima of the spectral sr - intensities recede from the orbit plane with increasing particle energy .",
    "there exist limiting angles ( at @xmath15 ) for the maxima , which depend on the synchrotron frequency .",
    "thus , in contrast with the integral sr - intensity , the spectral ones have the tendency to deconcentrate themselves on the orbit plane .",
