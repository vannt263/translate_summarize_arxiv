    "indeed , barger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the issue of whether there is a need for a substantial population of as - yet undetected highly - obscured agns depends critically on how the low - energy and high - energy xrb measurements tie together .",
    "regardless , the combination of the theoretical modelling predictions for a population of highly - obscured agns missing from the deep x - ray surveys and the possible observational evidence for a substantial unresolved fraction of the xrb has inspired observers to try to quantify the fraction of obscured agns that may be being missed .",
    "deep mid - infrared ( mir ) and radio images are an obvious avenue for searching for highly - obscured agns , since extinction in the mir and radio is small . various approaches using mir or x - ray data ( e.g. , alonso - herrero et al .  2006 ; polletta et al .  2006 ) , the combination of mir and radio data ( e.g. , martnez - sansigre et al .  2005 ) , or the combination of mir , radio , and x - ray data ( e.g. , donley et al",
    ".  2005 ) have been adopted , and a candidate population of highly - obscured agns has been identified .",
    "however , the various selection effects in these approaches mean that a reliable upper limit on the number of highly - obscured agns that are undetected even in the @xmath11  kev band has not yet been obtained .    in this paper , we take an alternative approach to look for highly - obscured agns at high redshifts using a pure microjansky radio survey selection .",
    "ultradeep radio surveys are very useful for tracing the evolution of dust - obscured galaxies and agns .",
    "in contrast to optical surveys , which may omit dusty sources , and submillimeter surveys , which currently have low spatial resolution and are limited to small areas for any significant depth , the 1.4  ghz surveys do not suffer from extinction , provide subarcsecond positional accuracy , and cover large areas .",
    "although the jansky and millijansky radio source populations are dominated by powerful agns , at the microjansky level , the radio source population is increasingly dominated by star - forming galaxies , which produce non - thermal radio continuum at 1.4  ghz through synchrotron emission from supernova remnants . in local star - forming galaxies and radio - quiet agns , it is well - known that the radio power is tightly correlated with the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity ( e.g. , helou et al .  1985 ; condon et al .  1991 ; condon 1992 ) , probably as a result of both being linearly related to the massive star formation rate . if we assume that this correlation continues to hold at high redshifts ( note that there is some observational support that the correlation does extend to @xmath13 from the work of appleton et al .",
    "2004 , though the number of galaxies at the higher redshifts is relatively low ) , then we can use this relation to estimate the total fir luminosity of a galaxy from its radio power alone . indeed , even with the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", this is still the most robust way to estimate a galaxy s total fir luminosity , due to the limited mips sensitivities at 70 and 160  @xmath14 m and the uncertainties in the conversion from 24  @xmath14 m luminosity to total fir luminosity . although estimating total fir luminosities from 24  @xmath14 m data has been advocated ( e.g. , appleton et al .",
    "2004 ; marcillac et al .  2006 ) , the conversion depends on the assumed shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which is expected to change as a function of dust temperature and metallicity .    using their _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) data , dale et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a total range in rest - frame 8  @xmath14 m ( which corresponds to observed - frame 24  @xmath14 m at @xmath15 ) to total fir luminosity ratios of more than a factor of 20 .",
    "when they excluded the metal - poor dwarfs , the total range dropped to a factor of 10 , which they argued should be taken as a minimum systematic uncertainty for total fir luminosities inferred from rest - frame 8  @xmath14 m fluxes alone .",
    "they cautioned that if the metal abundance of the population can not be inferred a priori , then the uncertainties may be considerably higher .",
    "likewise , they found that the rest - frame 24  @xmath14 m to total fir ratio spans a factor of 5 in the sings sample .",
    "in addition to our assumption that the fir - radio correlation continues to hold at high redshifts , the other possible concern with our procedure of estimating the total fir luminosities of the radio sources using the fir - radio correlation is the presence of radio - loud agns .",
    "for these sources , the radio continuum will be in excess of the level expected from star formation , and we will overestimate their total fir luminosities .",
    "fortunately , however , since we are only interested in obtaining upper limits on the number of highly - obscured agns , this is not a major concern for our present analysis , and we have conservatively not made any effort to remove such sources from our sample .",
    "finally , we note that even in the case of the radio - quiet agns , we are not able to separate out the agn contribution to the fir luminosity from the star - forming contribution . however , since local radio - quiet agns are empirically observed to follow the fir - radio correlation , we have an upper limit on the agn fir emission , which is sufficient for our analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we use the ultradeep 1.4  ghz observations of the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ; richards 2000 ) , for which we have obtained very complete spectroscopic identifications , to study the properties of the radio sample .",

    "2003 , but we have not applied that correction here . )    to calculate the contribution to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) from a given sample , we summed the fluxes in the @xmath155 radius circle and divided by the corresponding area .",
    "we did not exclude any sources from the summations , even if a source were not significantly detected in a particular band or had a measured negative flux in the band .",
    "this simple averaging is not optimal , since the errors in the x - ray fluxes are smaller at smaller off - axis angles , but it avoids weighting the smaller central region more highly .    to estimate the uncertainties on our surface brightness measurements , we first generated a grid of 60,000 points in the @xmath155 radius area that are separated from each other by more than @xmath161 ( the aperture diameter used to measure the counts in the x - ray sources ) and are located more than @xmath162 away from any known x - ray source .",
    "we next measured the fluxes in each of our four x - ray passbands at these 60,000 positions .",
    "this serves as our base file .",
    "then , for each sample for which we want to determine the uncertainties , we randomly generate a number ( which matches the number of sources in the sample ) of integers between 1 and 60,000 and use the fluxes corresponding to those positions in our base file .",
    "we do this 1000 times , which gives us 1000 flux values for each of the four passbands .",
    "we then order those values from the most negative to the most positive and use the 68% confidence interval to determine our uncertainties .",
    "( most of our uncertainties are much smaller than the data points . )    in figure  [ figxraysb ] , we show the ebl from the x - ray sources in the alexander et al .",

    "we chose this determination to compare with since the a2 or cosmic x - ray experiment instrument was especially designed for accurate measurements of the xrb over a very wide sky solid angle ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "1980 ; boldt 1987 ; gruber et al .  1999 ) , and the design of its detectors allows the internal instrumental background to be separated from the xrb with almost absolute accuracy ( rothschild et al .",
    "1979 ; boldt 1987 ) .    however , for this work , we are not interested in accurately determining the resolved fraction of the xrb .",
    "such an analysis would require integrating the known @xmath164 distribution to take into account the rare , bright sources that are not sampled in this deep pencil - beam survey , extrapolating the number counts to take into account the sources with fainter fluxes , and deciding which of the xrb measurements to compare with .",
    "indeed , this was done by moretti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and there is very good agreement between their result and the revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measurement .",
    "rather , it is sufficient for us to measure the x - ray surface brightnesses from the known x - ray sources in the cdf - n and see that they are roughly consistent with the heao1/a2 xrb measurement . in other words , we are not concerned with uncertainties at the @xmath165% level .",
    "our aim is just to see roughly what fraction of the x - ray light comes from the various populations .",
    "we begin by considering only the alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ) x - ray sources that are not radio sources in the richards ( 2000 ) catalog . in figure  [ figxraysb ] , we show the computed x - ray surface brightnesses from these sources with open diamonds .",
    "we find that they contribute @xmath166% of the x - ray light in the @xmath5  kev band .",
    "next , we examine how much the total radio sample contributes to the x - ray light . in figure",
    "[ figxraysb ] , we show our computed x - ray surface brightnesses for this sample with solid squares .",
    "we see that the radio sample also contributes @xmath167% of the x - ray light in the @xmath5  kev band . in other words , radio sources to the richards ( 2000 ) 1.4  ghz flux limit of 40  @xmath14jy are markers for half of the x - ray light at these high energies .",
    "this contribution is the same as the contribution from the x - ray sources that are not detected at these radio fluxes .",
    "however , most of the light contributed by the radio sample comes from the x - ray  luminous radio sources . to show this , we next measure the x - ray surface brightnesses of the sample of radio sources without x - ray ",

    "thus , although some of the radio sources are contributing additional x - ray light that is not already in the x - ray sample , such contributions are very small .",
    "this immediately tells us that the current radio source population can not account for the background light that has been suggested may be missing at these energies .",
    "indeed , the percentages are about a factor of 5 lower than those predicted for @xmath171  @xmath7 sources at these energies in typical xrb synthesis models ( e.g. , comastri , gilli , & hasinger 2006 ) .    however , the inverse statement that some of these non  x - ray  luminous or x - ray  undetected radio sources contain highly - obscured agns is true .",
    "we can see this by comparing the shapes of the x - ray surface brightness measurements for the various samples with the shape of the xrb . to make it easier to do the comparisons , in figure  [ figxraysb ] , we normalize the 1.4 photon index of the xrb to the surface brightnesses in the highest energy bin for all but the x - ray sample and the x - ray sample without radio counterparts ( to avoid cluttering up the figure too much ) .",
    "we can see that the shape of the surface brightness measurements for the radio sample is slightly softer than that of the xrb , while the shape of the surface brightness measurements for the x - ray sample without radio counterparts is slightly harder than the xrb . however , the shapes of the surface brightness measurements for the non  x - ray  luminous radio sample and the x - ray  undetected radio sample both appear much harder than that of the xrb .",
    "this result suggests that these two populations are consistent with containing highly - obscured agns .",
    "one might wonder how the shapes of the x - ray surface brightness measurements for the non  x - ray  luminous radio sample and for the x - ray  undetected radio sample vary with redshift .",
    "we show this in figures  [ figxraysbz]a and b for the redshift intervals @xmath172 _",

    "small offsets have been applied in the @xmath175-direction to the diamonds and to the triangles for clarity .",
    "the uncertainties are again the 68% confidence intervals .",
    "we normalize the highest energy bins of the @xmath176 and @xmath177 samples to the 1.4 photon index of the xrb for comparison . in both figures",
    ", we can see that the lowest redshift interval sample _",
    "( squares ) _ is quite soft due to the contributions from star - forming galaxies , while the higher redshift interval samples are hard due to the obscured nature of the sources .",
    "since in  [ secuplim ] we focused on the @xmath140 radio - identified ulirg sample , we now repeat our source - stacking analyses using only these data .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ figulirgsb ] .",
    "we use solid squares to denote the x - ray surface brightnesses measured for the @xmath140 ulirg sample with x - ray  luminous ( @xmath2 or @xmath3  ergs  s@xmath4 ) counterparts in the alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ) catalog .",
    "these sources contribute @xmath178% of the x - ray light in the @xmath5  kev band , which shows that sources with ulirg radio powers are responsible for contributing a very substantial fraction of the xrb .",
    "we use open triangles to denote our measurements for the @xmath140 non  x - ray  luminous ulirgs .",
    "these contribute only @xmath179% of the x - ray light in the @xmath5  kev band .",
    "finally , we use open squares to denote our measurements for the @xmath140 ulirgs with no x - ray detections at all in the alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ) catalog .",

    "we see that the shape of the x - ray  luminous ulirgs is quite well matched to the xrb , while the shapes of the non  x - ray  luminous ulirgs and the x - ray  undetected ulirgs are considerably harder , rising steeply towards the higher energies .",
    "again , this is consistent with these samples being highly obscured .",
    "however , even if we interpret them as such , their contributions to the @xmath5  kev light are very small , and they are unlikely to contribute substantially to the xrb at even higher energies .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the nature and evolution of microjansky radio sources using a highly spectroscopically complete , deep vla survey of the hdf - n region .",
    "we supplemented the spectroscopic identifications with photometric redshifts measured from the rest - frame ultraviolet to mir spectral energy distributions .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "@xmath181 we found that the fraction of radio sources that can be optically spectroscopically identified is fairly independent of radio flux , with about @xmath0% identified at all fluxes .",
    "we spectrally classified the galaxies into four spectral types : absorbers , star formers , seyfert galaxies , and broad - line agns .",
    "@xmath181 we did not confirm the existence of an x - ray  radio correlation for star - forming galaxies in either the hard or soft x - ray bands .",
    "previous claims of such a correlation appear to be the result of selection effects .",
    "@xmath181 we did not observe any correlation between 1.4  ghz flux and @xmath1 magnitude , which helps to explain the uniformity of the spectroscopically identified fraction with radio flux .",
    "previous claims of the existence of such a correlation were likely due to the much shallower optical observations that were used in those studies .",
    "@xmath181 we also did not observe any correlation between 1.4  ghz flux and redshift for the spectroscopically and photometrically identified sources . the redshift distribution is consistent with being invariant with radio flux , though we may be missing the higher redshift tail of the redshift distribution function due to optical spectroscopic bias",
    ".    @xmath181 the observed invariance in the rest - frame colors and only small amount of change in the absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies suggests that radio observations sample the same type of host galaxies at all redshifts and that the host galaxy properties are not evolving much with redshift .",
    "@xmath181 there is dramatic evolution in the radio powers of the host galaxies with increasing redshift , and similar optical galaxies are hosting more powerful radio galaxies at higher redshifts . a quantitative description the evolution of the 1.4  ghz luminosity function can be found in cowie et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "@xmath181 assuming that the locally determined fir - radio correlation holds at high redshifts , we estimated total fir luminosities for the radio sources .",
    "we note that these will be overestimates in the case of radio - loud agns , but we conservatively did not try to remove the radio - loud agns from the sample , since we are only determining upper limits . for the radio sources with total fir luminosities comparable to quasar - like bolometric luminosities , we obtained an upper limit of 1.9 for the ratio of candidate highly - obscured agns to x - ray  luminous sources .",
    "@xmath181 we measured the x - ray surface brightnesses for various x - ray and radio populations within a @xmath155 radius circle to determine their contributions to the x - ray light . for the known x - ray sources in the cdf - n , we found our measurements to be ( coincidentally ) consistent with the heao1/a2 xrb measurement made by revnivtsev et al .",
    "we found that the richards ( 2000 ) radio sample contributes half of the @xmath5  kev light , which is also how much the x - ray sources without radio counterparts contribute .",

    "the non  x - ray  luminous and x - ray  undetected subsamples contribute only @xmath169% and @xmath170% , respectively .",
