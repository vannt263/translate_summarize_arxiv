    "advances in submillimeter telescopy have enabled the discovery of flattened structures , in some cases clearly keplerian disks , surrounding massive ( @xmath2 ) protostars @xcite . the logical inference  that high mass star formation ( hmsf ) proceeds through disk accretion  raises a question : can such disks process rapid mass accretion , or do they fragment to produce secondary stars ? we seek to answer this question by estimating the criterion for disk fragmentation in the vicinity of a massive star .",
    "if massive - star disks typically do not fragment , then disk accretion poses little barrier to massive star formation .",
    "conversely if disk fragmentation occurs , then accretion onto the central star may be ( partially ) choked off , as suggested by @xcite in the context of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei .",
    "moreover each massive star that forms from a fragmenting disk may be surrounded by smaller stars that began as disk fragments .",
    "it is therefore important to evaluate models for hmsf in light of the disk fragmentation criterion .    the current work uses and extends the results of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter ml05 ) , who showed that protostellar disks around low mass stars are strongly stabilized against fragmentation by a combination of viscous heating and irradiation by the central protostar .",
    "massive star formation is fundamentally different , however , in three important ways .",
    "the rapid rise of luminosity with mass implies that stellar irradiation is far more intense ; this tends to stabilize disks against fragmentation .",
    "however , massive stars must accrete quickly to form at all ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and rapid accretion favors fragmentation . these effects compete to set the critical radius outside of which disks fragment . whether fragmentation actually occurs depends on the initial disk radius , which itself depends on the physical state of the gas prior to accretion .",
    "we discuss disk fragmentation in ",
    "[ dfrag ] , considering the stabilizing effect of viscous heating (  [ visc ] ) before incorporating irradiation by the central star (  [ irrad ] ) .",
    "this combination allows us to identify (  [ nomodel ] ) the disk radius at which fragmentation sets in .",
    "the @xcite core collapse model is examined in more detail in  [ coremod ] : we compute angular momentum scales in  [ angmom ] using formulae derived in the appendix . in  [ coreval ] we calculate expected fragmentation radii for a range of masses in the core collapse model .    turning to the consequences of fragmentation",
    ", we examine in  [ fragments ] the likely properties of stars born within fragments and the possibility that fragmentation limits accretion . in  [ observations ]",
    "we compare our results with observed regions of hmsf .",
    "we shall concentrate on fragmentation due to local gravitational instabilities , which set in when toomre s parameter @xmath3 descends toward unity . here",
    "@xmath4 is the disk s surface density , @xmath5 its orbital frequency , and @xmath6 is its adiabatic sound speed .",
    "( we shall frequently refer to the isothermal sound speed @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ratio of specific heats . )",
    "observational inferences of massive circumstellar tori @xcite indicate that they may be subject to _ global _ instabilities as well .",
    "we discuss this possibility briefly in  [ finitemass ] ; however the local instabilities tend to occur first , and their relation to fragmentation is better understood .",
    "several authors have identified the fragmentation boundary in terms of a cooling time .",
    "following @xcite and ml05 , we convert this criterion to a critical mass accretion rate at a given midplane temperature .",
    "the cooling time @xmath9 is the ratio of the internal energy per area , @xmath10 $ ] , to the dissipation rate per unit area  which , in steady accretion , is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the flux through each disk face . eliminating @xmath4 , the maximum accretion rate is @xmath13 for later convenience we write this in terms of the isothermal sound speed @xmath7 . extrapolating from @xcite s two - dimensional simulations for a stiff equation of state , ml05 estimate @xmath14 for the case of a three - dimensional , @xmath15 disk . using smoothed - particle hydrodynamics , @xcite have simulated just such a disk , finding @xmath16 to lie between 6 and 7 when it fragments .",
    "assuming also @xmath17 , this implies @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath20 , the critical temperature is then significantly ( 1.6 times ) higher than ml05 estimated .    at face value",
    "this weakens the conclusion , reached by ml05 , that fragmentation is unattainable in low - mass protostellar disks .",
    "however , more recent simulations show that disks remain stable at shorter @xmath9 depending on how abruptly cooling is implemented ( e.  harper - clark 2006 , private communication ) . due to uncertainties in the aforementioned cooling factor , and in light of the stringent resolution requirements for collapse outlined by @xcite , we consider the value of @xmath16 obtained by @xcite to be uncertain by up to a factor of two .",
    "we shall therefore be conservative , by adopting the stricter ml05 criterion that fragmentation occurs when @xmath21 since the mass accretion rate is comparable to @xmath22 in the core collapse scenario , where @xmath23 is the ratio of pressure to density in the core , equation ( [ cscrit ] ) implies , qualitatively , that a disk fragments if its sound speeds falls below the effective sound speed of its parent core ( see equation [ [ cs_versus_sigma_for_frag ] ] below ) .",
    "this point was made for thermally supported cores by ml05 , and equation ( [ cscrit ] ) simply extends the rule to turbulent cores .",
    "equation ( [ cscrit ] ) is conservative in the sense that fragmentation may also occur at somewhat higher values of @xmath24 .",
    "it is even more conservative given that @xmath8 declines from @xmath25 at the higher temperatures relevant to massive star formation .",
    "we shall make several other conservative estimates in order to show that disk instability is all but inevitable during massive star formation .",
    "when assessing disk stability in a given scenario , we first calculate the midplane temperature profile @xmath26 of the disk given its central mass @xmath27 , central luminosity @xmath28 , and accretion rate @xmath29 . for this",
    "we adopt the @xcite @xmath30 parametrization of viscosity , in which the steady mass accretion rate is @xmath31 for the choice of critical temperature made in equation ( [ cscrit ] ) this corresponds to @xmath32 at the onset of fragmentation .",
    "we keep @xmath30 fixed at 0.30 throughout our analysis , as this correctly reproduces the fragmentation boundary , although this is an overestimate for stable disks .",
    "having identified the _ fragmentation radius _ as the location where the disk sound speed falls to the critical value in equation ( [ cscrit ] ) , we then compare this to the characteristic disk radius @xmath33 for accreting gas with specific angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "we set the viscous accretion rate equal to the accretion rate from the envelope , and let @xmath17 .",
    "we then check whether the disk can remain in this steady state with two models for heat generation . in  [ visc ]",
    "we ignore the luminosity from the protostar and find a minimum value for @xmath35 using only the viscous generation of heat .",
    "next , in  [ irrad ]",
    ", we include the flux from the protostar received at the disk surface , and again solve for the midplane temperature as a function of radius .",
    "figure [ jforcores ] plots the ratio @xmath38 as given by equations ( [ < j^2>-angular ] ) and ( [ < sigma^2>-angular ] ) for a turbulent core profile , a critical bonnor - ebert sphere , and a thin shell .",
    "the results are very close to power laws in @xmath36 : @xmath39 the spin parameter @xmath40 makes reference to the velocity dispersion @xmath41 at radius @xmath42 , rather than the mean velocity dispersion @xmath43 within @xmath42 . for this",
    "we use the scaling @xmath44 to derive @xmath45 with this correction factor accounted for , @xmath46 is still very close to a power law of @xmath36 : @xmath47 ( the last line is unchanged , as there is no correction for a thin shell . ) these formulae were quoted in  [ angmom ] .",
    "we now return to the derivation of equation ( [ < j^2 > ] ) ; equation ( [ < sigma^2 > ] ) is treated below .",
    "the @xmath48 component of the specific angular momentum of the core is @xmath49 here , as below , we use subscripts 1 and 2 to indicate functions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 . on ensemble averaging of the second line , the last two terms in equation ( [ j^2-initform ] ) become zero thanks to the @xmath53 in equation ( [ dv - dr ] ) .",
    "the first two terms are equal , thanks to spherical symmetry ; thus @xmath54 spherical symmetry allows us to replace @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 , so @xmath59 the first two terms within the brackets are zero , as spherical symmetry requires them to be even in the space coordinates while @xmath60 is odd ; the surviving term yields equation ( [ < j^2 > ] ) .    to prove equation ( [ < sigma^2 > ] ) we write @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the center of mass velocity .",
    "in equation ( [ j^2-initform ] ) we replace @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and we bring the first term into similar form by multiplying it by @xmath65 : @xmath66 the second line follows from the first by noting that the integral is antisymmetric under interchange of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "when averaged , it yields equation ( [ < sigma^2 > ] ) ."
