    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in f - doped lafeaso near 25 k @xcite along with the ability to essentially double @xmath4 either by application of hydrostatic pressure @xcite or by substitution of rare earths @xcite has given rise to a new sense of optimism within the high temperature superconductivity community .",
    "first of all , these materials break the tyranny of copper , offering high transition temperatures without requiring the presence of copper oxide .",
    "secondly it is not at all clear ( experimentally ) what the mechanism for superconductivity in these materials is , although there are a multitude of exotic and intriguing theoretical predictions .",
    "unfortunately , the growth of single crystals of these compounds , specifically the superconducting variants , has proven to be difficult .",
    "single grains as large as 300 @xmath10 m have been characterized as part of polycrystalline pellets ( synthesized at 3.3 gpa ) @xcite and free standing crystallites @xmath11 100 @xmath10 m across have been grown out of high temperature salt solutions ( again at high pressures ) .",

    "this means that superconductivity in the ( ba@xmath13k@xmath14)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system not only breaks the tyranny of copper , it also implies that the superconductivity of these feas - based compounds is not intimately associated with oxide physics .",
    "in addition to this conceptual simplification , there is a profound experimental simplification as well : bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is an intermetallic compound and can be grown in single crystal form utilizing conventional growth from a metal solvent , or flux . in this paper",
    "we present crystallographic , as well as anisotropic thermodynamic and transport data on single crystals of the non - superconducting parent compound , bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 as well as on superconducting ( ba@xmath1k@xmath2)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",

    "once the furnace reached 500 @xmath16c the sn was decanted from the ( ba@xmath13k@xmath14)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals . whereas the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 growth was cooled from 1000 @xmath16c , when the potassium doped growths were taken to 1000 @xmath16c there was a clear attack on the silica wool as well as on the silica tube and a greatly reduced amount of k in the resulting crystals . in order to avoid this loss of k ,",
    "@xmath17 growths of ( ba@xmath13k@xmath14)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 were only heated to 850 @xmath16c . even with this precaution in place , we found it necessary to use excess k in the growth to compensate for losses due to the combination of potassium vapor pressure and reactivity .",

    "the diffraction patterns were recorded while the temperature was varied between 10 k and 300 k. the mosaicity of the investigated bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystal was @xmath23 fwhm in the rocking curve of the @xmath24 reflection .",
