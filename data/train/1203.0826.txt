    "one dimensional magnetic systems are recognized as an ideal playground for the search of novel states of matter . indeed , by varying the interactions ( near neighbour , next nearest neighbour ) various states can be stabilized and have been the focus of experimental studies in the recent past , where high field magnetization experiments have played a central role .",
    "their experimental exploration has in turn induced some theoretical developments to understand the observed properties .",
    "various models for one - dimensional magnetic systems with different spin hamiltonians have been theoretically investigated .",
    "it is only in the last 10 - 15 years that experimentalists are coming up with actual realizations of different model systems .",
    "clearly , real systems are quite often much more complex compared to simple models . in such cases , further efforts by theorists based on information pertaining to a real system , often lead to an improved understanding of its properties . among the various chain - like @xmath15 , antiferromagnetic ( af ) systems investigated , a compound with a `` diamond - chain '' geometry has been under focus recently .",
    "the system consists of isolated chains of corner - shared diamonds ( squares ) . with the presence of antiferromagnetic couplings and possibility of frustrated nearest - neighbour interactions ( due to the two edge - shared triangles within a diamond ) , exotic physics might result . in practice , cu@xmath0(co@xmath0)@xmath16(oh)@xmath16 or",
    "azurite is the only compound investigated with the diamond chain structure .",
    "measurements of the susceptibility , heat - capacity , and high - field magnetization in this compound have revealed it to be a prototypical substance for the frustrating diamond - chain model.@xcite high - field magnetization data evidence the presence of a @xmath17 magnetization plateau . if one considers the chain to  comprise of alternating dimers and monomers , this plateau is thought to arise due to complete polarization of the monomers by the applied magnetic field . as for the correct model which could describe the experimental data ,",
    "the initial work suggested all the interactions to be antiferromagnetic .",
    "however , inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite actually suggested that one of the interactions between the spins comprising the dimer and the monomer was ferromagnetic .",
    "in contrast , later numerical studies @xcite found that all the experimental data could be explained by considering a model where all the interactions were antiferromagnetic ( and therefore strongly frustrated ) and there also existed an interaction between the monomers",
    ". motivated by this work , we thought it would be interesting to search for other systems with a similar geometry , the studies on which might help to elucidate the physics behind the unusual features of azurite .",
    "one such possible system could be ba@xmath0cu@xmath0sc@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bcso)*. *    at first sight , the structure of bcso is quite appealing .  consider the cuo@xmath18 plaquette as a unit .",
    "now imagine a square made up of four such units with cu at the vertices .",
    "if we arrange these squares in a corner - sharing configuration , we will get the classic diamond - chain .  in bcso ,",
    "the only difference with respect to the classic diamond - chain is that the adjacent squares have their planes orthogonal to each other ( rotated about the diagonal ) .",
    "given that there has been hardly any experimental / theoretical work pertaining to bcso except for structural studies @xcite and a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) investigation , @xcite bcso therefore appears to be a fit case for further investigation .",
    "there are two important issues that need to be addressed .",
    "( i ) are the magnetic linkages as simple as suggested by the structure ?",
    "the magnetism would therefore be that of a low - dimensional compound .",
    "( ii ) what are the dominant magnetic interactions and what are their relative magnitudes and signs ?    with the above considerations in mind we have undertaken a detailed investigation of bcso .",
    "bulk techniques such as susceptibility , heat capacity and neutron diffraction have been used to establish the gross nature of magnetism in the material .",
    "local probe @xmath8sc nmr has helped us to determine local magnetic and structural properties via a measurement of the @xmath8sc nmr shift and the line shape .",
    "the main outcome of the above measurements is that bcso does not show any signs of low - dimensionality in the temperature range investigated 1.8 k-300 k.  on the contrary , clear evidence of af order at @xmath10 = 16 k from the bulk ( @xmath19100% as shown from zero - field @xmath9sr ) of the sample is seen while susceptibility data at high-@xmath6 ( 100 k-300 k ) are indicative of ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper * *  * * is to reconcile this apparent contrast between the expectations based on atomic arrangements and the observed lro and to provide a basis for understanding * *  * * ferromagnetic interactions at high-@xmath6 but af order at low-@xmath6 .  in order to address these issues , we have carried out density functional theory based electronic structure calculations .",
    "we have as well calculated various exchange interactions in the generalised gradient approximation gga  +  u  framework ( here , u is the on - site coulomb repulsion energy ) .",
    "the results of these calculations enable us to resolve the apparent surprises of the experimental data .",
    "the main conclusion is that the strongest magnetic interaction in bcso is between a cu and its nearest neighbour and is ferromagnetic .",
    "the diagonal interactions ( in the diamond ) as also the next - nearest neighbour interactions along the chain are af and substantial ( about half the magnitude of the nearest neighbour couplings ) . the observed lro appears to be due to comparably strong couplings between neighboring chains . due to the frustration generated by a mixture of comparable f and af couplings , the system is susceptible to loss of lro in moderate applied magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .  following the section on experimental details",
    ", we present the results of our various measurements corresponding to the paramagnetic state of bcso .  while the x - ray diffraction and neutron diffraction data validate the structure of  bcso , bulk susceptibility and heat capacity help characterize the magnetic interactions and the lattice properties .",
    "we next discuss results which establish the onset of lro in bcso at @xmath6 @xmath1916 k.  this is followed by presentation of the results for the @xmath6-region below the ordering temperature including the effect of an applied magnetic field on the ordering temperature .",
    "this is followed by a discussion section which uses the results of our electronic structure calculations which are instrumental in obtaining a coherent understanding of the experimental data .",
    "the important conclusions are given in the last section .",

    "a small change in the slope of the magnetization is observed at @xmath68 k at @xmath84 koe .",
    "the change can be clearly seen in the derivative of magnetization with field .",
    "this probably arises from a spin - flop transition .      in order to understand the field sensitive ordering in this system , we performed heat - capacity measurement in different fields upto @xmath75 koe using the heat - capacity set - up ( attached to the ppms ) by the thermal  relaxation method .",
    "4(a ) shows @xmath7 versus @xmath85 the @xmath7 has two contributions , lattice and magnetic . in order to separate the lattice contribution ,",
    "it is normally useful to make measurements on an isostructural non - magnetic analog of the given system ( possibly by replacing the cu atoms by zn and mg atoms ) .",
    "however , neither is there is any report of a non - magnetic analog of bcso nor did we succeed in preparing such a compound .",
    "we then went ahead and analyzed the lattice part of the @xmath86data in the @xmath87 k region using the debye model.@xcite the data could not be fit with a  single debye temperature , but we were able to fit the data to the following formula in the @xmath30range @xmath63 k to @xmath88 k , which contains a linear combination of two debye integrals .",

    "the  obtained parameters are @xmath93 @xmath94 k@xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 k. although the fit is good , the magnetic heat - capacity , obtained from @xmath7 by subtracting the lattice contribution , has a broad maximum at about @xmath65 k which seems unphysical .",
    "the entropy change calculated from magnetic specific heat is about @xmath98 j / mol k cu , which is smaller than that expected ( @xmath992 ) for @xmath15 systems .",
    "extracting the lattice contribution by fitting to a debye model in a lower range ( say 40 - 100 k ) might help to remove the 30 k broad anomaly .",
    "however , the entropy change in that case would be even smaller .",
    "this suggests the existence of a magnetic contribution to heat - capacity at temperatures much higher than @xmath71 ( the deviation from cw law in the magnetic susceptibility begins above 100 k ) .",
    "this is in tune with our electronic structure calculations ( presented in a latter section ) which suggest the existence of long - range ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "a sharp anomaly is observed at@xmath100 k ( as in @xmath45 )  which is a clear indication of ordering . in fig .",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath102 is plotted as a function of @xmath6 for various magnetic fields .",
    "the peak moves to lower temperatures as the applied field is increased until it is smeared out and more - or - less disappears when the applied field is @xmath32 koe .",
    "the @xmath71 s ( peak positions ) obtained from @xmath102 vs @xmath6 data are in agreement with those obtained from @xmath45 data ( see fig .",
    "@xmath78 ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath60 k anomaly ( in zero field ) there is also a broad maximum around @xmath76 k in the @xmath103 vs @xmath6 data .",
    "while this , in principle , could be due to some change in the spin - order , we did not find any evidence of this in our @xmath9sr data down to @xmath104 k. another possibility is that it is a schottky anomaly from @xmath105 defects .",
    "however , no significant field - dependence is seen for the low@xmath54 anomaly .  but this could be simply because it gets masked by the large contribution from the heat capacity from the af part .",
    "for the same reason , any curie - like upturn in the low@xmath54 susceptibility is overwhelmed by the large susceptibility of the af part .",
    "@xmath106 shows the refinement of the nd pattern at @xmath33 k. cell parameters obtained by nd are in fair agreement with the xrd results .",

    "magnetic reflection @xmath112",
    "@xmath113 @xmath114 gets completely suppressed under fields of @xmath67 koe and above , indicating a suppression of magnetic ordering . considering that only one magnetic bragg peak was clearly observed and the associated uncertainties in determining the integrated peak intensities ( in the presence of a background ) , we feel that the obtained magnetic moment values are in tune with those from our bulk magnetisation data in high fields .",
    "the above results then clearly suggest that the bcso system must have significant three - dimensional magnetic interactions which lead to the observed lro .",
    "further , our observations indicate the presence of competing magnetic  interactions / frustrations .",
    "both these suggestions are later validated by our electronic structure calculations .",
    "while the bulk probe data provide important input concerning the physical properties of the system , local probes such as @xmath9sr and nmr enable us to obtain a deeper look at the system often giving fine details which are not accessible otherwise .",
    "strong evidence of a conventional magnetic ordering is provided by @xmath9sr data taken in zero applied field .",
    "indeed , as reported in fig .  8 ,",
    "clear oscillations of the time evolution of the muon polarization ( the `` asymmetry''of the muon decay  @xcite ) are observed at 1.5  k. the signal combines several frequencies , as seen from the fourier transform spectra of fig .",
    "this is a clear - cut signature of the existence of well defined internal fields on several inequivalent muon stopping sites .",
    "these local fields cause a coherent precession of the muon spin components perpendicular to the local field direction , averaging to a 2/3 value of the total spin polarization for a powder sample .",
    "these well defined oscillations are therefore characteristic of a magnetic long - range ordered state at low temperature .",
    "also , the magnetic order arises from the bulk ( nearly 100 % ) of the sample .",
    "the precession frequency @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 mhz / t and @xmath122 is the average magnitude of the local field at the _",
    "_ i__th muon site .",
    "in addition , the long - time asymmetry in our background - free experiment tends to the remaining non - oscillating 1/3 part of the total asymmetry which , in a static picture , accounts for the powder averaged fraction of the muon spin components that lie parallel to the local magnetic field .",
    "this 1/3 value is therefore typical of the absence of strong dynamical effects in this system .",
    "the existence of multiple sites is in tune with the structure since there are 3 inequivalent oxygen sites and , usually , in oxides , muons bind to an oxygen at a distance @xmath123  .",
    "note that there can be more magnetically inequivalent muon trapping sites than the number of inequivalent oxygen ions .",
    "typical spectra in a narrow @xmath6-range around the magnetic transition are displayed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "a slowly relaxing gaussian asymmetry originating solely from quasi - static nuclear dipolar fields , dominates the paramagnetic regime above the transition temperature ( see the 16.58  k data ) .",
    "it is found to sharply replace the oscillating asymmetry in the selected narrow @xmath6-range .",
    "this underlines the sharpness of the transition which can be estimated to be at @xmath124  k from this plot , in fair agreement with that extracted from the zero field susceptibility and heat - capacity data .",
    "the @xmath6-variations of the frequency of the oscillations can be followed up to the magnetic transition ( fig .",
    "9 ) and scale with each other .",
    "this shows that once the order is established at @xmath71 no further variation ( even minute ) of the magnetic structure occurs down to the lowest probed temperature .    after normalizing the frequencies ( these track the order parameter ) to their value at @xmath125  k",

    "the full width at half maximum at the lowest temperature measured ( @xmath31 k ) is about @xmath164 oe from the spectrum at @xmath165 khz while the total spread of the line is close to 5000 oe .",
    "this is a measure of the field distribution seen at the @xmath8sc site .  from the crystal structure",
    ", it appears that @xmath8sc is hyperfine coupled to three cu ions of which two are equivalent .",
    "the total hyperfine coupling was found to be -4.5 koe .",
    "therefore , the coupling per cu is about -1.5 koe/@xmath81 .",
    "therefore with a 1 @xmath81 magnetic moment localized at each cu site , one would expect the total spread of the line to be around 4.5 koe consistent with our observation .",
    "in typical cases where antiferromagnetic ordering is observed , a single nmr line splits into two below the ordering temperature .",
    "this happens due to the internal field ( at a magnetic site ) either adding to or opposing the external magnetic field .",
    "however , one needs single crystals in order to observe the abovementioned splitting .  in the present case",
    ", we have polycrystalline samples ( efforts to align these powders in an external field were not successful ) .  here",
    ", a rectangular lineshape might be expected in the ordered state if the internal field at the @xmath8sc sites is small compared to the applied field",
    ".  since there are inequivalent @xmath8sc sites due to local distortions / defects as already suggested by the room - temperature nmr spectrum in addition to a quadrupolar broadening ,  it results in a generic dome - shaped lineshape .",
    "in contrast to our @xmath9sr measurements which were done in zero field , our nmr measurements have been done in various applied fields .  here , we are able to track the changes in the magnetic state due to an applied field .",
    "there are two main pieces of information that are obtained : ( i ) there is a decrease of the ordering temperature due to an applied field . in fig .",
    "@xmath162 , the measured nmr spectra at a fixed frequency at @xmath158 khz ( i.e. @xmath166 koe ) in the @xmath30range from @xmath66 k to @xmath31 k are shown . in this field ,",
    "the signal is retained down to @xmath31 k ( see also the inset of fig .",
    "@xmath162 ) due to the absence of ordering .",
    "( ii ) there is possibly a change in the spin - ordering as a function of temperature in the ordered state .  as we see in the inset of fig .",
    "11 , a broad feature ( indicated by an arrow mark ) is present at @xmath167 k and it vanishes progressively as the temperature is increased to @xmath168 k. in the variation of bulk magnetization with @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath76 ) , there is a change in the slope of @xmath79 at @xmath169 koe , which is smeared out in @xmath79  isotherms at high-@xmath6 .",
    "so , the appearance of the broad feature in the nmr spectrum might be associated with the spin - flopped phase .",
    "in addition we have also plotted the spectra measured at @xmath167 k at different frequencies @xmath170 khz , @xmath171 khz , @xmath172 khz , and @xmath173 khz in fig . @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "the line width at @xmath31 k is smallest for highest frequency and/or field ( where there is no ordering ) and progressively increases at lower fields where the internal field distribution affects significantly the line shape .",
    "particularly the line shape of the spectra corresponding to @xmath170 khz and @xmath171 khz ( which are in magnetic fields below @xmath161 koe ) are different from the shape of the spectrum measured at @xmath176 khz .",
    "this means that internal field below @xmath161 koe ( where a spin - flop transition is observed ) is different from the internal fields above @xmath65 koe .",
    "this change might be associated with the spin - flop transition observed in @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the information obtained from the local probe measurements mentioned above could be summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , the existence of lro at 16 k from the bulk of the sample is confirmed by @xmath9sr in zero field .",
    "the linear scaling of the nmr shift with the measured susceptibility ensures that the @xmath6-dependent part of the measured susceptibility is in fact the intrinsic spin susceptibility confirming the sample to be free from magnetic defects / impurities .",
    "the loss in the intensity of the nmr signal well above the ordering temperature is indicative of the presence of short - range order or a large @xmath6-regime of slow fluctuations .",
    "the field dependence of the ordering is also exhibited in the nmr measurements .  in order to throw light on the various magnetic interactions which are important in bcso ,",
    "it is necessary to make an effort on the theoretical front .",
    "this is carried out in the next section following which we arrive at a fuller understanding of bcso .",
    "our analysis of the electronic structure of ba@xmath0cu@xmath0sc@xmath1o@xmath2 are carried out in the framework of the tight - binding linearized muffin tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) within local density approximation to the density functional theory@xcite .",

    "while the system is metallic in lda ( see the dos in the inset ) , inclusion of coulomb correlations , within lsda+u makes the system insulating .    as the six band manifold",
    "is well separated from the rest , so a tight - binding model with a single cu _",
    "_ d__@xmath183 orbital per cu site would be a good approximation to the full band structure close to the fermi level .",
    "we have employed nmto downfolding method to construct a low energy , few band tight - binding model hamiltonian for this system .",
    "the down - folding method consists of deriving a few - orbital effective hamiltonian from the all - orbital lda hamiltonian by downfolding the inactive orbitals into the tails of the active orbitals kept in the basis chosen to describe the low energy physics .",
    "this method results in renormalized effective interactions between the active orbitals ( here cu-__d__@xmath183 ) retained in the basis . in the present case the low - energy bands form an isolated set of bands and",

    "14 and we note that the agreement with the full band structure is remarkable thereby justifying our low energy model hamiltonian .",
    "table @xmath68 shows the various dominant effective hopping integrals between cu ions at site @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "these have been abbreviated as @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a number indicating the path shown in fig .",
    "1 we gather from table @xmath192 that the strongest hopping is @xmath193 between cu2 and cu2 in a particular diamond . as anticipated ,",
    "cu2 and cu1 hopping in the diamond is weak due to its geometry , while unexpectedly cu1 - cu1 coupling along the chain is quite strong . in order to obtain insights on the cu1 - cu1 hopping @xmath194",
    "we have plotted the cu1 wannier function in fig .",
    "we find from the figure that cu1-__d__@xmath183 strongly antibinds with the neighboring oxygens which in turn antibind with cu2 and again via oxygen to cu1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the oxygen tails bend in order to strengthen the cu - o bonding and therefore the cu1-o - cu2-o - cu1 super - super - exchange path ( sse ) resulting in a dominant @xmath194 interaction which is otherwise prohibited by symmetry .",
    "table @xmath68 also reveals that in addition to the intra - chain hoppings the inter - chain hoppings are quite dominant .    guided by the various hopping strengths we have computed twelve exchange interactions for three different u values and the results of our calculations",
    "are presented in table @xmath68 . the antiferromagnetic contribution to the exchange using second - order perturbation",
    "is given by @xmath195 and is also listed in table @xmath68 ; here @xmath196 are various hoppings and @xmath197 is the effective coulomb interaction taken to be 4 ev in our calculations . from table 2",
    "we gather that the dominant exchange interaction @xmath198 is ferromagnetic , while @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 are antiferromagnetic .",
    "as expected , antiferromagnetic @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath201 decrease with increasing @xmath204 values .",
    "further , inter - chain interactions @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 are ferromagnetic .",
    "we note both intra - chain as well as inter - chain interactions are substantial accounting for the magnetic long range order seen for this system .",
    "the high temperature behaviour is dominated by the strong nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath198 .",
    "this strong ferromagnetic exchange follows from the anderson - goodenough - kanamori rules goodenough , kanamori as the @xmath208 is 86.84@xmath209 ( close to 90@xmath209 ) . at low temperature further long range interaction",
    "dominates primarily mediated by oxygen via super - super exchange and accounts for the antiferromagnetic behaviour .",
    "an estimate of the asymptotic curie - weiss temperature @xmath210 obtained from the calculated exchange interactions within the mean field approximation @xcite yields @xmath210 = 96 k , 68 k and 55 k for @xmath204 = 4 , 6 , 8 ev respectively , in good agreement with our experimental result ( 65 k ) .",
    "our work on ba@xmath0cu@xmath0sc@xmath1o@xmath2 was motivated by its crystal structure which suggested the possibility of exotic magnetic behaviour due to the apparent diamond - chain - like configuration of the magnetic cu atoms . whereas our detailed work has demonstrated the dominance of 3d magnetic interactions , there are several interesting features in the magnetism of this compound .",
    "the high-@xmath6 magnetic susceptibility is curie - weiss - like with a positive asymptotic weiss temperature suggestive of _ ferromagnetic _ interactions .  in contrast",
    ", the ordering is found to be antiferromagnetic with the magnetic moments at the cu1 and cu2 sites are aligned opposite to each other .",
    "this has to be seen in light of our electronic structure calculations which indicate comparable cu1-cu1 and cu2-cu2 interactions .",
    "a possible scenario that we have discussed in this paper is that the stronger cu1-cu2 ferromagnetic interaction ( this exchange coupling is of the order of 160 k ) drives the high-@xmath6 curie - weiss behaviour while the weaker cu1-cu1 and the cu2-cu2 antiferromagnetic exchanges ( of the order of 50 k ) drive the transition to af order at low-@xmath6 .",
    "the sensitivity of the transition temperature to an applied magnetic field ( a field of 70 koe was sufficient to decrease the @xmath10 from @xmath60 k to zero while one might have naively expected this to happen in a field of about 240 koe ) is , at first sight , somewhat puzzling and indicates the presence of competing interactions .",
    "this is also suggested by the heat - capacity measurements where the observed entropy change due to the af ordering is found to be smaller than the expected value of @xmath2112 .",
    "another interesting aspect is the change in slope in the low - temperature @xmath4 vs @xmath5 isotherms .",
    "this , coupled with the observed difference in the @xmath8sc nmr lineshapes at 1.2 k in various applied fields points towards a change in the spin ordering with increasing applied field , at around 23 koe .  our detailed electronic structure calculations have indicated the presence of a dominant ferromagnetic interaction as also several , somewhat weaker antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "these calculations then enable us to qualitatively reconcile with our experimental data .",
    "we note that our @xmath9sr measurements were done in zero field and the absence of  any change in spin ordering seen there is not in contradiction with the above data .",
    "a yet another interesting feature has to do with the crystal structure .",
    "since the @xmath8sc nucleus has @xmath212 its nmr spectrum should be a quadrupole powder pattern provided the site symmetry of the @xmath8sc nucleus is lower than cubic .  in ba@xmath0cu@xmath0sc@xmath1o@xmath2 , there are sco@xmath132 octahedra with only a slight deviation from the perfect octahedral environment ( i.e. , only a small crystalline electric field gradient _ efg _ at the center of each octahedron ) .",
    "accordingly , the room temperature nmr spectrum of @xmath8sc in ba@xmath0cu@xmath0sc@xmath1o@xmath213 exhibits weak satellite intensities suggesting that many of the sites feel a negligible _ efg _ while the remaining give rise to a quadrupole - broadened powder pattern , presumably due to structural distortions around them .     to conclude ,  our extensive measurements coupled with  _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations ( where we have determined the relative strengths and the signs of the exchange interactions between various copper ions and also the asymptotic weiss temperature @xmath210 ) have helped in developing a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic properties of ba@xmath214cu@xmath0sc@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we find that our work shows that the system is complex and a naive assessment of the crystal structure / atomic arrangement to arrive at a conclusion regarding the magnetic dimensionality can be misleading and a theoretical determination of the various important magnetic couplings is essential for a complete picture .",
