    "adiabatic passage processes have been successfully studied in several areas of physics , such as quantum optics , ultracold atoms , and light propagation in coupled waveguide systems . in quantum optics ,",
    "two techniques have been extensively studied , the so - called stimulated raman adiabatic passage @xcite ( stirap ) and the rapid adiabatic passage @xcite ( rap ) . in both cases ,",
    "an eigenstate of an atomic system interacting with a specific sequence of laser pulses is modified in time and adiabatically followed , achieving a complete and robust transfer of population between two internal atomic levels of the system .",
    "adiabatic passage processes have been extended to the external degrees of freedom of ultracold atoms,@xcite being proposed for the transport of single atoms between the most distant traps of a system of three tunneling - coupled potential wells , the so - called spatial adiabatic passage .",
    "subsequently , spatial adiabatic passage processes have also been discussed for the transport of electrons,@xcite bose ",

    "light guiding in waveguides has been broadly studied , being tir waveguides the most technologically developed.@xcite however , the introduction of photonic crystals ( phcs ) @xcite provided a new way of light guiding by means of linear defects , consisting in rows with unitary cells with a modified geometry,@xcite which could be integrated in much smaller sizes than the traditional tir waveguides .",

    "in particular , we will investigate the sound propagation in systems of two linear defects in sonic crystals ( scs).@xcite scs are a particular case of pcs that consist of solid scatterers embedded in a fluid host medium .",

    "we will present the considered physical system consisting of two coupled linear defects in a sc , and we will calculate the allowed bands into the band gap and their corresponding supermodes .",
    "we will also distinguish between two different frequency ranges inside the band gap , one where two supermodes coexist , and another range with only one supermode available . in section [ sc_twosmode ] , for the frequency range in which both supermodes exist , we will study spatial adiabatic passage processes through the coupled - mode equations , and we will design a coherent multifrequency adiabatic splitter , in subsection [ sc_cmas ] , and a phase difference analyzer , in subsection [ sc_pda ] . in section [ sc_onesmode ] , we will focus on the frequency range with only one supermode , for which we will design spatial adiabatic passage processes that will make the system behave as a coherent multifrequency adiabatic splitter and as a coupler .",

    "[ sc_fig2](b ) there is another band ( light gray solid line or orange color in the online version ) which significantly overlaps in frequencies with the a band .",
    "this band corresponds to a higher order supermode of the system with an antisymmetric transverse profile within one waveguide ( see fig .",
    "[ sc_fig2](b ) ) .",

[ sc_fig2](b ) ) , the s supermode is localized in the linear defect with smallest radius ( @xmath44 in the figure ) whereas the a supermode stays localized in the linear defect with larger radius ( @xmath45 in the figure ) . in general , the transverse amplitude profiles of the supermodes can be modified by changing the difference between the radii sizes : the more different the radii of two defects are , the more localized the supermodes are in one of the defects .",
    "thus , if one of the supermodes of the system is excited , either the s or the a , by smoothly changing the radii of the linear defects along the propagation direction it is possible to adiabatically follow the initially excited supermode of the system , which , due to the radii modification , will smoothly change its transversal amplitude profile along the propagation direction.@xcite this adiabatic following , which corresponds to the so - called spatial adiabatic passage process,@xcite allows for the control of the sound propagation along linear defects in scs",
    ". if the radius modification is not smoothly performed , sound waves will not be able to adiabatically follow the change of the transverse profile of the initially excited supermode along the propagation direction , exciting other supermodes of the system and we would lose the control of sound propagation .",
    "it is important to remark that spatial adiabatic passage processes have the advantage that they are robust in front of variations of the parameter values . in our case , fluctuations in the size of the defects are not critical to perform a spatial adiabatic passage process ,",
    "only a smooth enough variation of the radii size is needed to adiabatically follow the considered supermode .",
    "the propagation of sound along two defects for frequencies in which both s and a supermodes exist ( light gray shadow in figs .

    "whereas when @xmath76 , the condition @xmath77 is fulfilled and @xmath62 is equal to either @xmath78 or @xmath79 , depending on the sign of @xmath80 . in this way , by changing the difference between the radii of the linear defects , it is possible to modify the mixing angle @xmath62 from either @xmath78 or @xmath79 , corresponding to the s and a supermodes localized in only one of the defects , to @xmath81 , where the s and a supermodes are equally spread between the two linear defects .",

    "in this section we will apply the previous ideas coming from the coupled - mode theory in order to obtain a robust @xmath82 coherent superposition of sound waves at the output of a sc with two coupled linear defects . to this aim",
    ", we need to modify the mixing angle @xmath62 from either @xmath78 or @xmath79 to @xmath81 .",

    "this is the case of the coherent multifrequency adiabatic splitter , where by designing a structure with two linear defects starting with very different radii of the defects , @xmath126 and @xmath44 , and ending with defects of the same size , @xmath127 , it is possible to modify the transverse profile of the a supermode from being very localized in one of the defects to equally spread in the two linear defects . in fig .",

    "although the results here show a narrower range of working frequencies and a bit higher oscillations of the total power reaching the output as compared to the one presented in section [ sc_cmas ] , the structure can be significantly shortened ( approximately @xmath130 times with respect to the one presented in section [ sc_cmas ] ) .",
    "additionally , given the short length of the splitter , it is possible to design a structure made of two of them , one after the other , with the second one rotated by @xmath131 degrees with respect to the first one . by doing this ,",
    "sound waves initially in one of the linear defects are completely transferred to the other linear defect by adiabatically following the a supermode , see fig .",

    "we have demonstrated for the first time to the best of our knowledge the possibility to apply spatial adiabatic passage processes to the field of sound waves propagation in linear defects .",
    "sonic crystals with two linear defects that change their geometry along the propagation direction are designed in order that the sound waves adiabatically follow a supermode of the system .",
    "two different frequency ranges within the band gap are studied .",
    "first , a frequency range in which two supermodes of the system coexist . for this frequency range ,",
    "two structures have been designed working as a coherent multifrequency adiabatic splitter and as a phase difference analyzer .",
    "second , a range of frequencies in which only one of the supermodes exists . in this range of frequencies ,",
    "a reduction in length of the designed structures is possible since transitions to any other supermode are strongly suppressed .",
    "a coherent multifrequency adiabatic splitter and a coupler have been designed for this range of frequencies .",
    "it is important to note that since these applications are based on spatial adiabatic passage processes , they are robust and do not depend on specific parameter values of the physical system .",
    "additionally , the equations for sound propagation in sonic crystals can be directly related to the te or tm modes for light propagation in two - dimensional systems .",
    "therefore , the applications here discussed could be easily extended to the field of light propagation in photonic crystals with linear defects .",
    "furthermore , the applications described through the coupled - mode equations could also be extended to other kinds of optical waveguides such as standard tir waveguides .",
