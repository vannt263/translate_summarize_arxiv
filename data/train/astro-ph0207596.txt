    "metal deficient stars are believed to be the oldest stars in the galaxy , and their surface abundances have probably not changed ( except for radioactive decay ) since these stars were formed .",
    "moreover , their age can be regarded as the galactic age and a lower limit to the cosmic age . as a chronometer ,",
    "this method is particularly appealing since it avoids the usual galactic chemical evolution model dependence @xcite associated with solar - system radio cosmochronometry .",
    "the th or u on the surface of an old low - metallicity halo star were probably generated in a single nucleosynthesis event .",
    "hence , the surface abundance of radioactive element @xmath8 ( r = th or u ) is given to a very good approximation by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is time since nucleosynthesis and @xmath11 is the mean life of the r - element , _",

    "* ) r - process elements in metal deficient stars have been interpreted as evidence for a universal @xmath1-process abundance distribution in operation in the early galaxy . in particular , more recent observations @xcite all show similar abundance distributions for @xmath20 elements .",
    "this feature is often referred to as the `` universality '' of the @xmath1-process .",
    "hence , it is generally believed that , at least for @xmath20 elements , the astrophysical site and associated yields of r - process nucleosynthesis are unique . based upon this assumption ,",
    "@xcite estimated the ages of several stars using the ratio of th / eu at the time of formation of the solar system as the initial production ratio [ even though solar - system material has experienced multiple supernovae before its formation and has experienced th decay ] .",
    "the analyses of these stars all indicated similar present ages of about 14 gyr @xmath21 4 .",
    "there are , however , some reasons to question the assumption of a universal @xmath1-process abundance curve .",
    "the material out of which these metal poor stars were formed is likely to have experienced only one or two supernovae before incorporation into the star .",
    "depending upon which particular progenitor supernova was in operation , there might be substantially different abundance distribution curves for these stars , compared to the ensemble average represented in solar - system material ( cf .",
    "* ) . moreover , quite recently , @xcite have reported the observation of peculiar r - process elements in the metal deficient star cs31082 - 001 .",
    "this is the first star for which a uranium line was also detected .",
    "this star has the strange feature , however , that the ratio of th to eu is greater than that of solar material .",
    "this would imply ( on the bases of th / eu ) that this star is younger than the sun .",
    "this seems unlikely in view of its low metallicity , [ fe / h ] @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , the th / eu age is in contradiction with the u / th age for this star which is 12 @xmath21 3 gyr .",
    "further evidence of th / eu uncertainty is apparent in the recent data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have reported on r - process element abundance distributions in two other metal - deficient stars .",
    "these stars also show different abundance distribution patterns for @xmath2 .",
    "even the stars studied in sneden et al.(1996 ) and sneden et al.(2000 ) may show deviations from a universal @xmath1-process distribution for lighter z @xmath23 56 nuclei .",
    "for example sneden et al.(2000 ) noted divergence from the solar r - process for a few elements in cs22892 - 052 .",
    "@xcite also noted some divergence in the star bd + 17 3248 , but those data are somewhat uncertain .",
    "this , together with meteoritic evidence , has been taken as an indication @xcite that two different @xmath1-process environments could be in operation .",
    "all in all , the observational data seem to indicate that the universality of r - process elements may be broken for @xmath2 elements and possibly z @xmath24 56 as well .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to clarify the astrophysical model dependence for these stellar r - process chronometers .",
    "several previous investigations @xcite of the uncertainties in actinide chronometers can be found in the literature .",
    "the paper by @xcite and @xcite were primarily directed toward understanding the nuclear uncertainties .",
    "for example , @xcite considered 32 different models for @xmath1-process actinide production based upon different nuclear physics input for fission barriers , nuclear masses , beta - decay rates , etc . in @xcite , it was found that the pb abundance was useful to constrain nuclear models .",
    "these calculations , however , were made in the context of schematic `` canonical event '' models which were constrained to reproduce solar - system @xmath1-process abundances .",
    "hence , universality for all elements up to z=82 was imposed . in another related work ,",
    "@xcite have attempted to clarify the age of cs31082 - 001 in the context of a specific `` neutrino - driven wind '' model , but with only electron fraction and the outer boundary temperature as free parameters . @xcite",
    "even shows on the basis of the astrophysical observations that the production of the elements with @xmath25 is not robust .",
    "all of these works have demonstrated some uncertainties in the th / eu chronometer , while better results are obtained using the u/ th chronometer .",
    "the present work differs from the previous works in two important ways : 1 ) unlike @xcite and @xcite , our focus is on the astrophysical rather than nuclear uncertainties ; 2 ) rather than to focus on a particular wind model as in @xcite and @xcite , we consider wide range of plausible astrophysical models and parameters all of which reproduce the universality in the abundances for 56 @xmath23 z @xmath23 75 noted in observations .",
    "we also explicitly considerneutrino interaction effects .    from the observations and our theoretical calculations ,",
    "we conclude that the astrophysical site for r - process nucleosynthesis is probably not unique , even though there is an observed universality of abundances .",
    "that is , a variety of astrophysical models can be constructed which reproduce the same apparent universal abundance curve for elements with @xmath0 , but which give large variations in abundances for elements with @xmath2 and/or @xmath26 .",
    "hence , it is dangerous to use the th / eu chronometer to estimate the age of metal deficient stars .",
    "moreover , the production ratio of the th / eu chronometer is strongly dependent upon the nucleosynthesis environment . on the other hand ,",
    "we demonstrate that the u / th production ratio is almost independent of the nucleosynthesis environment , confirming that this ratio is robust as a chronometer .    in what follows , we first review in more detail the recent observational results for metal deficient halo stars in section 2 . results of theoretical calculations",
    "are shown in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we will summarize the viability of the nuclear cosmochronometers .",
    "as noted above , it has been shown @xcite that the star cs22892 - 052 confirmed the previously noted fact @xcite that r - enhanced stars show an abundance distribution which is similar to that of solar r - process material for z@xmath2756 elements    several lighter elements ( z@xmath2856 ) , which would also be generated in the r - process , were also detected in this star .",
    "these elements , however , showed a different abundance distribution from that of solar material .",
    "the agreement between the heavier elements ( z@xmath2756 ) and scaled solar - system abundances has been reported for other metal deficient stars [ e.g. hd115444 @xcite , hd126238 , hd186478 , hd108577 @xcite ] . in addition , there is also evidence ( sneden et al .",
    "2002 ; aoki et al . 2003 ) that the europium isotope ratios in several r - process enhanced stars are consistent with the solar r - process isotope ratio .",
    "this further enhances the evidence of a single universal abundance curve for @xmath20 elements .",
    "hence , at least for z@xmath2756 elements , it is generally believed that astrophysical site for r - process nucleosynthesis is unique .",
    "if one can therefore assume that the solar - system and metal - deficient stars have the same abundance distribution when they form , then one can use the solar - system abundances as the initial production ratio .",
    "this approach has the problems that the material in the solar system represents an average of the ejecta from many supernovae , and the th and u present when the solar system formed will have decayed from its initial production ratio . nevertheless , this method is still useful as a means to estimate an upper limit on the age of these stars .",
    "several works have estimated the ages of those metal deficient stars using a scaled solar th / eu value @xcite .",
    "however , as noted above , @xcite have reported on a uranium line for the star cs31082 - 001 .",
    "although their abundance distribution shows a similar pattern to the solar system for 56 @xmath23 z @xmath23 75 elements , there are large differences for z @xmath29 75 elements .",
    "in addition to the fact that the th / eu abundance ratio is larger than in the sun , this star has less pb than in solar material @xcite .",
    "these two facts are strange because u and th decay into pb . as noted above",
    ", these facts would indicate that this star is much younger than the sun in spite of its lower metallicity .",
    "moreover , this age is , however , in conflict with the u / th age fot this star .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite have reported on r - process elements in several more metal - deficient stars which were observed using the subaru / high dispersion spectrometer(hds ) .",
    "of particular interest are the stars hd6268 and cs30306 - 132 @xcite .",
    "these two stars show a large th / eu ratio which is comparable to that of solar material in spite of their lower metallicity .    in summary ,",
    "the observations all seem to indicate the following : 1 ) for 56@xmath23z@xmath2375 elements : the r - process abundance distribution appears to obey a universal curve ; 2 ) for z@xmath2975 and some z@xmath2356 elements : the r - process abundance distribution may not always coincide with a universal abundance curve .",
    "all of this implies that the r - process nucleosynthesis environment may not be unique even though a universal abundance curve is produced for 56 @xmath23 z @xmath23 75 . in the next section",
    "we seek to explain these trends in the context of models for the @xmath1-process .",
    "we wish to clarify the dependence of the abundance distribution on the astrophysical environment .",
    "although it is generally believed that the astrophysical site for the r - process is an explosive event , the precise environment has not yet been unambiguously identified .",
    "type ii sne or neutron - star mergers have been proposed as two possible sites ( e.g. mathews & cowan 1990 ) with the neutrino - energized wind above the proto - neutron star @xcite being the currently most popular paradigm [ see however qian and woosely ( 1996 ) , cardall and fuller ( 1997 ) and meyer et al.(1998 ) ] . in the following , we base our schematic parameter study on two dynamical models",
    "one is the neutrino - energized wind model @xcite .",
    "the other is an exponential model .",
    "we believe that these parameter studies should approximate the gamut of possible r - process models such as might also occur , for example , in neutron - star mergers or prompt supernova explosions .      for the wind model , we use a spherical steady - state flow apploximation for the neutrino - driven wind ( cf . qian & woosley 1996 ; qian 2000 ; takahashi & janka 1997 ; otsuki et al .",
    "the hydrodynamic flow is deduced from the following non - relativistic equations : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the rate at which matter is ejected by neutrino heating from the surface of the proto - neutron star , and @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant . in equation ( [ eeq ] ) , @xmath35 is the protoneutron star mass , the total energy @xmath36 is fixed by a boundary condition on the asymptotic temperature @xmath37 @xmath38    for simplicity , in the present work we utilize an adiabatic ( constant entropy ) wind rather than to compute the neutrino heating explicitly ( e.g. as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is adequate for our purpose which is to sketch the dependence of the abundances on the nucleosynthesis environment .",
    "nevertheless explicit charged and neutral - current neutrino - nucleus interaction effects on abundances are included as described below .    using this model , we can calculate time profiles of temperature , matter , and the neutrino density for material flowing away from the proto - neutron star .",
    "these are then input into a nucleosynthesis network where the neutron density and abundance yields are computed .",
    "the coordinate r was chosen such that when @xmath39 , @xmath40 km . that way all trajectories experience the same initial neutrino luminosity .",
    "there are several theoretical calculations for r - process nucleosynthesis with a longer timescale than that of the wind models , e.g. in prompt supernovae .",
    "to model this we have used the following parameterized temperature and density profile . @xmath41 @xmath42 here , s is the entropy and @xmath43 is the dynamical timescale .",
    "our nucleosynthesis code is based upon the dynamical network calculation described in meyer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but with several important modifications .",
    "for one , an extensive light - element neutron - rich reaction network has been added as described in teresawa et al . ( 2001 ) and orito et al . (",
    "this light - element network can be important for high - entropy short dynamical timescale environments .",
    "we also compute the alpha - rich freezeout and the @xmath1-process in a single network rather than to split this calculation into two parts as was done in woosley et al .",
    "some results of our calculations for various parameters are shown on fig .",
    "1 . the calculations shown on this figure are for a constant neutrino luminosity of @xmath44 erg sec@xmath45 . in fig.2",
    ", we show the dependence on neutrino luminosity .",
    "we have included effects of neutrino - nucleus interactions on the nucleosynthesis yields . for more details of this code , see terasawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and reference there in .",
    "a sample of model parameters studied in the present work are summarized in table 1 and figures 1 - 3 . as noted below",
    ", most of these models reproduce the observed universality of elemental abundances for @xmath46 . for illustration",
    "we also show the implied europium isotope fraction + @xmath47 .",
    "most of these models are also consistent with the observed isotope fraction of @xmath48 ( sneden et al . 2002 ; aoki et al . 2003 ) .",
    "figures 1a - d and 2 illustrate the dependence of the nucleosynthesis yields on various parameters of the wind models .",
    "note , that all of these models are constrained to reproduce the observed universal abundances for @xmath49 as shown by the dots on figure 1a .",
    "we have not included the decay back to pb from long - lived u and th .",
    "here we only require that the initial production of pb is less than the observed pb to account for this decay back . ultimately , a quantitative account of pb is important ( schatz et al .",
    "2002 ) for constraining the nuclear physics input to the r - process and will be considered in a subsequent work .",
    "figure 1a shows the effects of entropy .",
    "changing the entropy essentially alters the neutron - to - seed ratio as the @xmath1-process begins .",
    "note , that all of these models show an almost identical abundance distribution for @xmath50 elements .",
    "clearly , the observed universality of the r - process is maintained for these elements . on the other hand ,",
    "elements with @xmath2 show much different distributions .",
    "obviously , the th / eu ratios would be substantially different for models with different entropy , even though the universal abundance distribution for @xmath51 elements is obtained .",
    "we have also studied effects of altering the electron fraction ( fig .",
    "1d ) and the dynamical time scale ( fig .",
    "these parameters similarly affect the neutron - to - seed ratio at the onset of the @xmath1-process , and produce nearly equivalent results to those shown on figure 1a , i.e. the abundance distribution for @xmath52 elements is unaffected , while elements with @xmath2 are significantly altered .",
    "note that varying @xmath53 has the smallest effect on the distribution , and hence , does not by itself give a fair representation of the model uncertainties .",
    "the asymptotic temperature @xmath37 at which neutron captures freeze out also affects the abundance distribution as shown in figure 1b . in this case",
    ", the freezeout temperature essentially determines the @xmath1-process path at the termination of the @xmath1-process .",
    "a discussion of this dependence on asymptotic temperature also appears in terasawa et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and wanajo et al .",
    "note , that in all three of the models chosen , the abundances between @xmath54 are consistent with the universal curve . in this case , however , both elements with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are substantially different .    in figure 2",
    "we also show the dependence upon neutrino luminosity .",
    "neutrino - induced beta - decay can also affect the abundance distribution .",
    "the main effect of neutrino luminosity in these models is to provide neutrino - induced neutron emission . for @xmath57 ,",
    "this helps to smooth the abundance distribution , especially just above the r - process peaks .",
    "neutrino interactions however can also significantly affect the heavy @xmath58 abundances .",
    "this is because neutrino capture on neutrons can increase @xmath53 and decrease the neutron to seed ratio .",
    "results for the exponential models are shown in fig .",
    "3 . if the dynamical timescale becomes longer than around 1.5 seconds , the yields begin to differ from the universal pattern .",
    "the longest dynamical timescale case shows a different pattern even for @xmath46 elements . it also shows a eu isotopic ratio which is inconsistent with the observed values .",
    "these differences relate to the fact that near freezeout neutron captures are in competition with beta decay in these models .",
    "hence , the r - process path at neutron capture freeze out is different .",
    "as discussed below , if we could resolve nuclear physics uncertainties , the observed abundance distribution might discriminate between short and long timescale astrophysical sites for the r - process .",
    "both observations and our theoretical calculations indicate that the observed universality of the @xmath1-process does not imply a unique astrophysical site for r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "that is , a variety of conditions can lead to the same observed universal abundance distribution in the @xmath59 region .",
    "the reason for the universality of the @xmath54 elements can be traced to the fact that there are no significant nuclear shell closures along the @xmath1-process path for the progenitor nuclides of these elements .",
    "the @xmath1-process path corresponding to @xmath60 equilibrium essentially flows along a fixed neutron separation energy given approximately as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass density of material in units of g @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the temperature in units of @xmath65 k , and @xmath66 is the neutron number fraction . in the models shown on figures 1a - d , there are no waiting points for the progenitors of @xmath0 elements .",
    "the progenitor nuclei have larger neutron capture cross sections .",
    "hence @xmath67 equilibrium is maintained longer for these elements .",
    "moreover , for a variety of astrophysical conditions the r - process path at freezeout is so far from stability that the final abundance distribution is dominated by the effects of beta - delayed neutron emission which leads to the same universal curve .",
    "our theoretical calculations show that the ratio of th to eu ( or to any other stable r - process nuclei for 56@xmath23z@xmath23 75 ) is strongly dependent upon the nucleosynthesis environment .",
    "table 1 summarizes th / eu ratios calculated in different environments most of which reproduce the observed universality and have initial th / eu ratios greater than that presently observed in cs22892 - 052 .",
    "these th / eu ratios vary by almost two orders of magnitude rendering an uncertainty in the inferred ages of at least a factor of 2 .    to estimate the age of a metal deficient star using the th / eu chronometer , one must therefore unambiguously identify the astrophysical site at which they were generated .",
    "this is particularly true for the oldest metal - poor stars whose initial composition is likely to have been enriched by only a single supernova event .",
    "the details of that particular supernova event are likely to be different from one metal poor star to another .",
    "therefore , it is dangerous to estimate the ages of metal deficient stars using the th / eu ratio .",
    "one can not predict the initial th / eu production ratio without identifying its nucleosynthesis environment .",
    "we note , however , that the sensitivity of light - element abundances and pb to parameters ( e.g. fig .",
    "1d ) might be used to help identify this environment .      on the other hand , because th and u are neighboring actinide nuclei , and because both are the result of an extensive alpha decay chain ( cowan , thieleman , and truran 1991 ) , one would anticipate that some of the above model dependence for this chronometric pair might be removed .",
    "we have studied various models of different entropy , @xmath53 , and freezeout temperature under the constraint that the abundances of 56 @xmath23 z @xmath68 75 elements be consistent with the observational results , and also that the initial production ratio of th and u to eu should be significantly larger than the presently observed value in cs22892 - 052 of @xmath69 ( cowan et al 1999 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes various models .",
    "three of the models shown in figures 1 - 3 are ruled out by these criteria .",
    "the ratio of @xmath70u/@xmath71th for each of these models is given .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that all models yield almost the same value of the u / th ratio even though the th / eu ratios are vastly different .",
    "these representative models all lead to a production ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "thus , our calculations indicate that u and th are nearly always generated in the same ratio as long as enough th and u are generated to be consistent with the observed abundances . since the stellar age only depends logarithmically of the production ratio by eq .",
    "1 , this is sufficiently accurate to determine the stellar age to @xmath73 or about @xmath74 gyr .",
    "hence , the u to th production ratio does not particularly depend upon details of the nucleosynthesis environment . using this chronometer ,",
    "one can , therefore , estimate the age of metal deficient stars without much astrophysical uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , the u to th ratio does , however , depend upon nuclear theoretical models [ e.g. @xcite ] , i.e. mass formulae , beta - decay rates , alpha - decay rates , and particularly @xmath75 -delayed fission and neutron emission @xcite .",

    "our theoretical calculations indicate that the coincidence of the observed abundance distribution for @xmath78 elements with the solar r - process abundances does not necessarily mean that all @xmath1-process events occur in the same universal environment .",

    "hence , it is not possible to predict the initial production ratio of th to eu in each metal deficient star without somehow independently identifying each production environment .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is substantial uncertainty when using the th / eu chronometer to estimate the ages of metal deficient stars .",
    "we note that the reason for the uncertainty is that in realistic ( e.g. sn wind ) r - process models , one tends to run out of neutrons as actinide elements are being formed . it might be possible , however , that an r - process environment could occur in which there were abundant neutrons present as the actinide nuclei are synthesized . in this case",

    "another possibility to reduce the th / eu uncertainty is that a combination of light - element ( z @xmath28 56 ) abundances and pb - region abundances @xcite might help to identify the environment .",
    "we also note that variations of the light - element abundances are quite natural in neutrino - driven wind models even when a universality of heavier elements is imposed .",
