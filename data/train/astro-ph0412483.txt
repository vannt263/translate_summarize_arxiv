    "our understanding of the origin of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has continued to advance rapidly in the years since the first x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite and radio @xcite afterglows were discovered .",
    "in particular the nearby afterglow from  has solidified the grb - supernova connection @xcite , and provided the first grb with a well determined expansion rate @xcite .",
    "this event has presented a unique opportunity to test afterglow models @xcite , and to explore the environment around a grb .",
    "afterglow models invoke gas - rich environments around at least some of the grbs .",
    "several basic properties of this circumburst medium are presently unknown , and need to be addressed in order to better understand the afterglow and its evolution . for example , in the simplest emission models , the density of the ambient medium is related to the afterglow flux density @xcite .",
    "especially , if grbs exist in both gas - poor and gas - rich environments , that could explain why afterglow is absent in some grbs .",
    "direct observations of the circumburst medium associated with grbs would thus provide an important test of the fireball model .",
    "another issue is the density profile of the medium into which the grb ejecta expands .",
    "current models postulate a medium in which density is governed by the mass - loss of the progenitor star ( @xmath6 ) . at present",
    "however , some observations instead point to a uniform density in order to explain the evolution of the afterglow lightcurve @xcite . in a few cases ,",
    "strong damped ly@xmath7 absorption has been found indicating  column densities as high as 5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 cm@xmath1 @xcite . during",
    "the expansion of the grb ejecta , the circumburst medium is likely to go through different stages of ionization .",
    "perna & loeb ( 1998 ) suggest that as a consequence ( optical ) absorption lines will vary in their ew with time .",
    "the rate of this variation can constrain the size of the absorbing region . similarly , in the radio the fraction of molecular and atomic gas should be governed by the effective ionization , and might therefore vary in a similar way .",
    "one way to investigate the circumburst medium is via atomic or molecular absorption studies in the radio .",
    "another way is to measure the deceleration of the expanding fireball . in this paper",
    "we present both late time very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of the afterglow of  and similar epoch  and oh absorption observations taken with the arecibo telescope .    assuming a lambda cosmology with @xmath10  km / s / mpc , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the angular - diameter distance of  at @xmath13 is @xmath14mpc , and 1 milliarcsec corresponds to 2.85 pc .",

    "other telescopes used were the effelsberg 100-m telescope , the phased vla , the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , the 305 m arecibo telescope , the westerbork ( wsrt ) tied array , and the noto and medecina telescopes of the consiglio nazionale delle ricerche . in all some 56 individual and combined antennas",
    "each of 25 m or more in diameter were employed with a combined collecting area of 0.12 km@xmath15 .",
    "most antennas were on - source for a period of 5.5 hours .",
    "all stations recorded with 256 mbps with 2 bit sampling in dual circular polarization with the exception of noto which had only a right - circular polarization receiver available .",
    "the observations were correlated at the joint institute for vlbi in europe ( jive ) .    the nearby ( 1.5@xmath16 ) source j1051 + 2119 was used for phase - referencing with a 2:1 minute cycle on source : calibrator . the weak calibrator j1048 + 2115",
    "was observed hourly to check on the quality of the phase referencing .",
    "self - calibration with a 1 hour solution interval was used to further refine the calibration and remove some slow - changing atmospheric phase errors .",
    "the final image has an rms noise of 24 @xmath17jy / beam .",
    "this is substantially higher than the expected thermal noise of 8@xmath17jy / beam , in part because of partial loss of signals from arecibo and westerbork for reasons not completely understood .",
    "we fit a symmetric , two - dimensional gaussian to the measured visibilities on  and find a size of 0.176 @xmath18 0.08 mas . as in @xcite",
    "the error of the size is estimated from signal - to - noise ratios and from monte - carlo simulations of the data using identical ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) coverage , similar noise properties , and a gaussian component of known size added .",
    "the standard deviation of the recovered sizes , modelfitted in the same way as we treat the observations , was found to be 0.053 mas .",

    "these observations are consistent with those reported by @xcite , and impose an even stronger limit on the proper motion .",
    "this limit argues against the cannonball model for grbs proposed by @xcite .",
    "single dish observations of grb  030329 were carried out with the l - band wide receiver of the 305  m arecibo radio telescope on 2003 november 30 , for a total of 2  hr .",
    "the simple position - switched observations utilized all four interim correlator boards to observe various l - band frequencies .",
    "the bandwidth of each board was 12.5  mhz .",
    "while the first two boards were set to observe the frequency of the redshifted @xmath2721  cm h  i line , recording each linear polarization with 2048 spectral channels , the other two boards were set to observe simultaneously the orthogonal polarizations at the frequencies of the redshifted @xmath2718 cm mainline oh transitions ( 1665 & 1667  mhz ) and the 1720  mhz satellite oh transition with 1024 spectral channels per polarization .",
    "following the editing out of data suffering from radio frequency interference , the total on - source integration time for the redshifted @xmath2721  cm h  i and the 1720  mhz satellite oh transitions was 30  min each .",
    "for the redshifted @xmath2718 cm mainline oh transitions , the on - source integration time was 50  min .",
    "figures  2 , 3 , and 4 show pairs of total - intensity spectra of the grb  030329 centered at the optical heliocentric velocity that corresponds to the frequency of the redshifted @xmath2721  cm h  i line , the redshifted @xmath2718  cm oh mainlines , and the redshifted @xmath2718  cm oh satellite line at 1720  mhz , respectively .",

    "spectra is 1.02 , 0.32 , and 0.57  mjy  beam@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the bottom plot in each figure is a five - channel smoothed version of the respective top spectra .",
    "the velocity resolution in these spectra is 8.80 , 14.98 , and 14.50  km  s@xmath25 , and the rms noise level of each spectrum is 0.482 , 0.224 , and 0.282  mjy  beam@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "no emission or absorption is seen in any of the arecibo spectra .",
    "we can derive a 3@xmath28 limit on the  opacity of @xmath29 with a velocity resolution of 8.8  km  s@xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to a column density limit of @xmath2 cm@xmath1 assuming a spin temperature of 100 k , and uniform coverage .",
    "if the spin temperature is higher or the line is shallow and wide , then this limit could be higher . given the extreme energies involved in the grb , enough to cause a sudden ionospheric disturbance in the earth s atmosphere @xcite some 740 mpc away , it could well be that nearly all the  along the line - of - sight in the host galaxy has been ionized and not yet recombined .",
    "further research in this area is needed .    in a similar manner",
    "we can place a 3@xmath28 upper limit on the 1667 mhz oh mainline opacity of @xmath30 with a velocity resolution of 15.0  km  s@xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to an oh column density limit of @xmath31 cm@xmath1 assuming a uniform covering factor , and an excitation temperature of 10 k. we can further deduce a limit on molecular hydrogen using the relation @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 10@xmath34 @xmath35 @xcite , of @xmath36 cm@xmath1 .",
    "the continuum flux density of the grb  030329 at 1.4  ghz at the time of these observations was @xmath37  mjy .",
    "the various spectra reported here show a higher continuum flux density , because of a 15  mjy continuum source located at an angular distance of about 3  arcmin from the grb  030329 , i.e. , within the primary beam of the arecibo radio telescope .",
    "our measured size of 0.176 @xmath18 0.08 mas is quite close to the size of 0.172 @xmath18 0.043 found by @xcite , indicating a possible slowing of the burst at late times .",
    "this trend was already apparent from the average expansion velocities derived from the angular size measurements on april 22 and june 20 .",
    "the entire history of expansion for  is shown in fig .",
    "the first measurement at 15 days comes from a model - dependent estimate of the quenching of the scintillation @xcite .",
    "the late time curvature may indicate that between 83 and 217 days ,  has transitioned into a non - relativistic expansion .",
    "alternatively , it is possible ( but somewhat contrived ) that the intrinsic surface brightness profile has changed in a way to compensate for the expansion . for all epochs",
    "we fit a two - dimensional gaussian model since our resolution does not permit us to discriminate between a gaussian , ring , disk , or more complex profile .",
    "a gamma - ray burst drives a relativistic blast wave into a circumburst medium of density @xmath38 whose radius @xmath39 is related to the energy of the explosion approximately by @xmath40 , where @xmath0 is the bulk lorentz factor of the fireball .",
    "more complete treatments are given by @xcite .",
    "the density profile of the circumburst medium is generally taken to be either a @xmath41 wind , or a constant density ism , such as one might find beyond the termination shock of the progenitor s stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the deceleration at late times currently favors the ism model of @xcite which shows a break in the expansion rate ( see their figures 4 and 6 ) . unfortunately , the large uncertainty in our measurement of the size of  at late times does not permit us to discriminate strongly between the various models .",
    "@xcite place the termination shock of the wolf - rayet wind at a distance of 0.4 pc from the progenitor . beyond",
    "that they predict a fairly constant density out to the red supergiant shell at a radius of 1.7 pc . with a current diameter of 0.5 pc for  ( radius of 0.25 pc ) at day 217",
    "it is near the termination shock , especially if the progenitor had a shorter lifetime , or a relatively high density ism has stalled the shock .      from 8.4 ghz vlba observations on april 6",
    "@xcite derived a 3@xmath28 limit on the linear polarization of 0.16 mjy / beam , corresponding to a limit on the fractional polarization of @xmath51.0% . in a contemporaneous optical observation @xcite",
    "measure a polarization of 2.2+/-0.3% .",
    "the decrease in polarization at lower frequencies has been explained as the result of the source being optically thick at 8.4 ghz at these early times since the maximum degree of linear polarization of an optically thick synchrotron source is 12% while the maximum polarization of an optically thin synchrotron source is about 80% @xcite . to look for any change in polarization with time as the source transitions to optically thin at 8.4 ghz we have analyzed the very sensitive , late time phased vla observations for polarimetry .",
    "we find no detection at either epoch and place 3@xmath28 limits of @xmath51.8% and @xmath54.7% on 2003 jun . 20 and 2003 nov . 1 respectively .",
    "the total intensity measured with the vla on these epochs is 3.11 @xmath18 0.03 and 0.75 @xmath18 0.02 mjy respectively .    the emission mechanism for the grb afterglow is widely accepted to be synchrotron radiation , which is intrinsically linearly polarized if there is an ordered component to the magnetic field , or if the magnetic field is generated at the internal shocks @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of 80 @xmath18 20% polarization in the prompt @xmath0-ray emission from grb 021206 @xcite , although controversial @xcite , has led to an increased interest in modeling the time and frequency dependent behavior of the polarization from the afterglow @xcite .    to have an observed polarization of @xmath55% in the late time afterglow ( see  2.2 )",
    "could be explained as the result of highly disordered magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "propagation effects can also reduce the intrinsic linear polarization below detectable levels . a faraday screen produced by ionized",
    "gas and magnetic fields can cause gradients in the observed polarization angle across the source , leading to depolarization if the resolution element of the telescope , or the size of the source if unresolved , is large compared to the gradients .",
    "the rotation measures ( @xmath42 ) can be related to the line - of - sight magnetic field , @xmath43 , by    @xmath44    where @xmath43 is measured in mg , @xmath45 in @xmath46 , d@xmath47 in pc , and the upper limit of integration , @xmath48 , is the distance from the emitting source to the end of the path through the faraday screen along the line of sight . we can estimate the minimum magnetic field needed to produce a gradient across the source . to produce a 90@xmath16 rotation at 8.4 ghz",
    "requires a rm of 1200 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "assuming a density within the red supergiant shell of 0.2 @xmath46 @xcite and a path length of 2 pc , then the magnetic field strength required is @xmath49 mg .",
    "this field strength is similar to the equipartition field strengths @xcite have found from modeling the radio emission from colliding - wind wolf - rayet ( wr ) binary systems , although the field strengths in these systems have probably been enhanced by the collision .",
    "faraday screens in the grb environment are considered in more detail by @xcite .",
    "while no detection of atomic ( ) or molecular ( oh ) material is found towards , the limits of @xmath2 cm@xmath1 are not particularly constraining .",
    "observations of more shielded molecules like nh@xmath50 towards future bursts at early times would be of interest , and given the expected strength of a nearby afterglow of @xmath3350 mjy or more , could yield detections , or place interesting limits on the amount of material in the grb environment .",
    "although grb 030329 has faded considerably , it may still be detectable with vlbi techniques .",
    "even crude estimates of the size could differentiate between the predictions of wind and constant - density environments at these late times .",
    "radio re - brightening of  has been predicted by @xcite , and @xcite estimate a level of 0.6 mjy 1.7 years after the burst .",
    "this re - brightening might occur as the counterjet becomes non - relativistic and therefore radiatively isotropic .",
    "this brightening will be accompanied by a temporary rapid growth in the size of the source as two , well - separated jets become visible , and by a change in the light centroid @xcite .",
    "if such a re - brightening occurs then a precise size estimate at late times becomes readily achievable with existing facilities .",
    "rather surprisingly , we find no detectable linear polarization from  at cm wavelengths to limits as low as 1%",
    ". this could indicate less order than expected in the magnetic fields of the external shock that drives the afterglow , or a faraday screen that depolarizes the radio emission .",
    "all of these limits are from 8 days or more after the burst . given the rhessi result @xcite of large polarization from the @xmath0-rays , and predictions of some fireball models , it would be well worth searching for polarization from the prompt optical and radio emission ( _ e.g. _ , granot & taylor 2005 ) .",
    "in the near future the _ swift _ satellite should dramatically increase the number of grbs with measured redshifts , revealing some that are nearby . in future vlbi studies of grb afterglows at redshifts less than 0.1",
    "it should be possible to image the structure of the afterglow .",
    "fireball models of heating by a single relativistic shock front predict that at late times the fireball should look like a ring @xcite .",
