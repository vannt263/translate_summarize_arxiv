    "energetic electrons are ubiquitous in plasmas , and bremsstrahlung radiation is one of their most important energy loss mechanisms @xcite . at sufficiently high energy , around a few hundred megaelectronvolts in hydrogen plasmas , the loss associated with the emission of bremsstrahlung radiation dominates the energy lost by the fast electron through elastic collisions .",
    "bremsstrahlung can also strongly affect electrons at somewhat lower energies , around a few tens of megaelectronvolts , particularly in high - density plasmas where the magnetic field is not too strong .    an important electron acceleration process",
    ", producing energetic electrons in both space and laboratory plasmas , is the runaway mechanism @xcite .",
    "this requires an electric field of intermediate strength , parallel to the magnetic field in a magnetized plasma : it must be stronger than a critical field to overcome the friction force that fast electrons experience due to collisions @xcite , while sufficiently weaker than the dreicer field , above which the entire electron population will promptly be accelerated @xcite",
    ". a fraction of the charged particles can then detach from the bulk population and accelerate to high energy , where radiative losses become important .",
    "disruptions in fusion devices can induce strong , time - dependent electric fields , leading to the generation of runaway electrons ( res ) with energies reaching several tens of megaelectronvolts  it has been proposed that runaway electrons in iter @xcite would be able to reach energies on the order of 100 mev @xcite .",
    "these electrons could severely damage plasma facing components .",
    "a key issue for iter and other future tokamaks is therefore to increase the understanding of the dynamics of these relativistic electrons , with the specific goal of reducing their energy and destructive potential @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the energy carried away by synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation can be important in limiting the energy of res .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced during disruption mitigation when large amounts of high - atomic - number gas ( e.g. neon or argon ) is injected , leading to an increase in the effective charge of the plasma .",
    "kinetic modeling of electron runaway , accounting for the synchrotron radiation reaction , is required to obtain an accurate description of runaway electron distributions .",
    "inclusion of the synchrotron radiation reaction has been found to both limit the growth rate of the re population @xcite and lead to the formation of non - monotonic features in the high energy tail of the distribution @xcite . similarly to synchrotron radiation , bremsstrahlung radiation is expected to change the fast electron distribution .",
    "the reaction force on test particles has been extensively studied and it was pointed out that bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation are both effective in controlling the energy of runaway electrons  @xcite . a quantitative study of how bremsstrahlung affects the runaway electron distribution function , however , is yet to be carried out . in this work , we will recap the kinetic description of the bremsstrahlung process in optically thin plasmas .",
    "this serves to illustrate the physics involved , and also acts as a foundation for the derivation of a simplified model operator , valid for typical runaway scenarios and allowing a quantitative study of the effect of bremsstrahlung on runaway electron dynamics .",
    "this , together with a description of the linearized two - dimensional kinetic equation used in the study , is contained in section [ sec : bremsstrahlung ] .    by extending the numerical tool code @xcite , we will in section [ sec : effect_on_dist ]",
    "study the effect of bremsstrahlung on the distribution of electrons in 2d momentum - space . from the distribution",
    "we will deduce the impact on the evolution of the fast - electron population , as well as how the synergy between bremsstrahlung and synchrotron affect the dynamics .",
    "we show that , because of the sensitive interaction between synchrotron force and pitch - angle scattering  @xcite , a higher effective charge of the plasma does not tend to favor bremsstrahlung over synchrotron , unlike the results previously reported  @xcite .",
    "in particular we derive a simple rule - of - thumb for when bremsstrahlung is more important than synchrotron for the evolution of the runaway population , and verify its validity numerically .",
    "the plasma parameters considered in this work primarily reflect those of electron runaway in tokamak plasmas , but the validity of the model and the conclusions ( presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) are applicable to a broader range of plasma parameters .",
    "the kinetic theory of inelastic processes is well understood , and is described in detail in monographs on the subject such as ref .  .",
    "yet , in this section we shall provide a brief but self - contained description of the kinetics of bremsstrahlung reactions , presented in a form that is suitable for the purposes of the present study .",

    ", reactions are accurately described only by relativistic quantum theory . in this picture ( in lowest - order perturbation theory ) , bremsstrahlung is a binary interaction between two charged particles , resulting in the emission of a photon .",
    "the frequency of the bremsstrahlung radiation is assumed to far exceed the plasma frequency , so that collective radiation effects can be neglected , and the plasma is assumed to be optically thin .",
    "these conditions impose no significant restriction ; as the photon energies are primarily of the same order as the incident electron energy , they correspond to frequencies of the order @xmath1hz .",
    "the question of the optical depth will be briefly discussed in sec .",

    "in addition , both @xmath45 and @xmath44 are generally logarithmically divergent expressions in the low - photon energy contributions ( physically corresponding to a large number of low - energy photons being emitted , carrying a finite total energy ) . while the last issue can be resolved by cutting the integral off at photon wavelengths comparable to the dimension of the system , the evaluation of the cross - section is often computationally expensive .    due to the infeasibility of integrating a detailed description of the bremsstrahlung process into current kinetic - equation solvers ( because of its computational intensity )",
    ", we will in the next section introduce a simplified model of the bremsstrahlung collision operator in eq .  , retaining some of its essential physical features while neglecting others .",
    "this will allow efficient solution of a kinetic equation suitable for runaway electrons , letting us quantify the importance of bremsstrahlung in magnetized plasmas where it , as an energy loss mechanism , competes primarily with synchrotron radiation .",
    "finally , to clarify the difference between the elastic and inelastic collision operators , the reason that the principle of detailed balance does not apply in the inelastic case is that it relates the bremsstrahlung cross - section to the reverse process where a photon is absorbed ( inverse bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "however , as we assume the plasma to be optically thin , the emitted photons will promptly leave the plasma before interacting again with the energetic electrons .",
    "the validity of this assumption is readily verified : the multi - mev bremsstrahlung photons ( having frequencies @xmath46 much larger than the plasma frequency ) primarily interact with the fast electrons through compton scattering , for which the photon mean free path is of the order @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the classical electron radius . as we are interested in runaway electron beams with typical densities @xmath49 m@xmath50 and typically populating space with linear dimension of order @xmath51-@xmath52 m , it is clear that emitted photons will not significantly interact again with the runaway electrons ( the ratio of beam dimension and photon mean free path @xmath53 being @xmath54 ) .",
    "we may therefore neglect the presence of the photon distribution for the present study of runaway electron dynamics .",
    "due to the complexities of fully modeling bremsstrahlung interactions in the kinetic equation , we will seek a simpler form .",
    "_ ad - hoc _ , we will assume a certain analytic form for the collision operator , and to uniquely specify its value we will demand that certain conditions  consistent with properties of the full collision operator in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : collision rate ] ) and ( [ eq : collision operator ] )  are satisfied",
    ". as we are interested in investigating the competition between accelerating electric field and bremsstrahlung as a slowing - down mechanism , it will be useful to look for a bremsstrahlung operator in the form of an effective single - particle force .",
    "such a force would take the form of an operator @xmath55 where @xmath56 can be identified as the reaction force associated with the bremsstrahlung interactions .",
    "a condition that uniquely defines @xmath56 can be found by requiring that the model operator @xmath57 produces the same total radiated energy as the full collision operator for an arbitrary distribution function .",
    "the energy rate of change is defined as ( using @xmath58 for the particle energy ) @xmath59    due to the symmetry in performing the integration over all variables , we may let @xmath60 in the first term of eq .",
    ", yielding @xmath61 the large mass difference between ions and electrons allows approximations to be made when calculating the energy radiated by the electron population , making it advantageous to treat the electron - ion and electron - electron interactions separately . in the electron - ion contribution",
    ", the characteristic speed of an ion in a population near equilibrium is much smaller than the electron velocities , @xmath62 , assuming @xmath63 and @xmath64 to be of the same order .",
    "therefore , as the differential cross - section is a function of the center - of - mass energy and hence varies over scales of order the incident electron momentum , we may approximate the ion population as delta - distributed , @xmath65 .",
    "conservation of energy allows us to relate @xmath66 when neglecting ion recoil effects , which are formally of order @xmath67 .",
    "consequently , we obtain a simpler relation for the energy loss rate : @xmath68 for electron - electron interactions , the expression in eq .",
    "is symmetric with respect to permutations of @xmath69 and @xmath70 when integrated , as we now consider identical particles .",
    "therefore , we may replace @xmath71 by @xmath72 and @xmath73 by @xmath74 , yielding the energy rate @xmath75 where now @xmath76 .",
    "this can be simplified to a form similar to the electron - ion case under the assumption that the fast - electron population can be treated as a perturbation to a sufficiently cold equilibrium . in that case",
    ", we may write @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the equilibrium solution and the perturbation @xmath79 includes the fast - electron population . in eq .",
    "we then find the term @xmath80 .",

    "therefore , as long as the electron temperature satisfies @xmath83 , the first term , quadratic in the equilibrium distribution , is negligible  @xcite .",
    "the remaining two terms can be combined due to the symmetry between @xmath20 and @xmath16 inside the integral , leaving the expression @xmath84 here , it has further been assumed that @xmath85 , since the energies of the fast electrons far exceed the thermal energy .",

    "is @xmath86 giving the same answer as @xmath87 for any distribution function @xmath88 , provided that we choose the bremsstrahlung reaction force as @xmath89 while a component orthogonal to the momentum unit vector @xmath90 would be consistent with the condition @xmath91 , it can be ruled out on a physical basis since the force arises from the interaction with spherically symmetric background particle populations ( delta - distributed in our linearized high - energy limit treatment ) , hence lacking any preferential direction except for that of the particle motion . by the same argument",
    "the force must also be independent of pitch - angle , and therefore represents isotropic friction .",
    "a few remarks are in order regarding the approximation used above .",
    "the form in eq .   for the bremsstrahlung force",
    "is commonly employed as a simple model for electron slowing - down by bremsstrahlung  @xcite , corresponding to the so - called radiation cross section often found in the literature @xcite .",
    "while this form for the reaction force is both well - established and elementary , the derivation provided here illustrates the conditions for its validity , and also highlights the physics that is lost : in treating the bremsstrahlung collision process in the manner described above , two effects have been neglected .",
    "first , it is clear that the force operator in eq",
    ".   describes only a continuous slowing - down of the electrons .",
    "since the photons emitted in bremsstrahlung interactions often have energies of the same order as the incident electron , the slowing - down would in reality occur in leaps rather than continuously .",
    "in addition , as the photons are emitted in random directions and momentum is transferred to the target , the electrons are also deflected in the process ( corresponding to a change in the pitch - angle ) , even though for an ensemble of electrons the angular deviation averages to zero .",
    "this would , akin to elastic coulomb scattering , diffuse the electron distribution in momentum space , an effect which is not captured in the above treatment .    finally , we remark that no energy is transfered from the electrons to the ions ( which are assumed to be infinitely heavy ) , making eq",
    ".   an accurate measure of the energy lost from the fast - electron population due to electron - ion bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "however , in electron - electron interactions , energy will be transferred from the energetic electron not only to the photon , but also to the slow target particle .",
    ".   is a lower bound for the energy loss of the fast - electron population .",
    "this can be compared to elastic scattering : since in that case @xmath92 , the integral in eq .",
    "would vanish identically .",
    "however , electron slowing - down still occurs due to the energy transfer to the slow target electron , which would not be captured by this treatment .",
    "also note that , due to conservation of energy and since no energy is transfered to the ion species , @xmath93 denotes the total power emitted from the plasma as ( bremsstrahlung ) x - rays . by construction",
    "this is true also for @xmath94 , limited only by the validity of the linearization procedure outlined above .      in this section",
    "we give explicit expressions for the bremsstrahlung reaction force . due to the fundamental limitations of the model operator derived in the previous section",
    ", we will seek no greater accuracy in the cross - sections than that provided by the born approximation in relativistic quantum theory . as we only consider fully ionized plasmas",

    "the presence of the bump effectively limits the maximum energy obtained by the runaways . since our bremsstrahlung radiation reaction force is isotropic , it does not exhibit the same pitch - angle dependence as the synchrotron force .",

    "it thus exhibits features from both the pure - synchrotron and pure - bremsstrahlung bumps , but is accompanied by a strong reduction in the particle energy at the bump peak ( what we will refer to as the _ bump location _ ) , compared to the other two cases .",
    "the dynamics in the presence of both synchrotron and bremsstrahlung forces can be understood by the following argument : the synchrotron reaction force , proportional to @xmath142 at large energies , acts mainly to limit the perpendicular momentum of the fast electrons , while allowing them to accelerate in the parallel direction .",
    "however , once the electrons reach an energy for which @xmath143 the spherically symmetric bremsstrahlung reaction force will stop them from being further accelerated in the parallel direction .",
    "as the electron distribution builds up in this region of momentum space , the increasing perpendicular gradient will cause a diffusive perpendicular momentum flux of electrons due to pitch - angle scattering , making the synchrotron force increasingly significant .",

    "we can find a similar estimate for the maximum electron energy in the presence of bremsstrahlung ( neglecting synchrotron effects ) by considering force balance on a test particle .",
    "there are primarily three forces acting on an electron in the high energy limit : the accelerating force of the parallel electric field , collisional friction , and the bremsstrahlung reaction force .",
    "the maximum electron energy can be expected to approximately coincide with the momentum for which the forces balance , above which friction will be greater than the accelerating electric field .",
    "this yields the condition @xmath146 where we have used the high energy limit of both the bremsstrahlung reaction and collisional friction forces .",

    "this method provides qualitative insight into the effect of bremsstrahlung on the distribution function , and allows for quantitative predictions of the maximum energy attainable by runaway electrons .",
    "in particular we have investigated the effect of bremsstrahlung radiation losses in combination with synchrotron radiation losses .",
    "we show that the inclusion of bremsstrahlung losses leads to non - monotonic ( `` bump '' ) features in the electron distribution function .",
    "similar features have previously been described in the presence of synchrotron radiation , but bremsstrahlung leads to much stronger gradients in the magnitude of the momentum , as well as more significant spreading in pitch - angle .",
    "the combined effect of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung therefore leads to a bump that limits the particle energy more efficiently than in the case of pure synchrotron radiation reaction . from force balance considerations we derived an expression for the maximum electron energy , which shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations using code .",

    "\\gtrsim b[t]^2 $ ] is fulfilled , the effect of bremsstrahlung radiative losses on the electron distribution function are expected to be more important than synchrotron radiative losses .",
    "the importance of bremsstrahlung compared to synchrotron was found to be insensitive to plasma composition due to the similar parametric dependence on ion species of the bremsstrahlung reaction rate and pitch - angle scattering ( related to the efficacy of synchrotron losses ) .",
    "this means that for typical tokamak - runaway scenarios we expect synchrotron radiation losses to dominate . in an iter - like plasma with @xmath193 t , for example , the required electron density for significant stopping power due to bremsstrahlung ( as compared to synchrotron losses )",
    "is of order @xmath194m@xmath50 , which is significantly larger than the expected operational density of order @xmath195m@xmath50 .",
    "however , in the case of massive gas injection for disruption mitigation , density increases of this order are possible , and in such scenarios it will be important to account for the bremsstrahlung losses , as well as synchrotron radiation losses , when modeling the slowing - down of fast electrons .",
    "note , finally , the limitations of the present study ; we have considered steady - state solutions of the distribution function at low electric fields ( @xmath187 of order unity ) , where particle fluxes in momentum space are in balance . in transient processes , such as the initial slowing - down following a spike in the electric field strength , or other acceleration process , it is conceivable that the balance between bremsstrahlung and synchrotron losses is temporarily shifted before quasi - equilibrium is established .",
    "this typically happens on a time - scale of a few ( relativistic ) collision times @xmath196m@xmath192)$]s .",
    "furthermore , as we have treated bremsstrahlung as a continuous process , the details of the shape of the distribution functions as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dists_s_b_sb ] and [ fig : dists_nb2 ] should be considered only indicative .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment accounting for the finite photon energies is likely to lead to a broader bump on the runaway tail due to the diffusive nature of the resulting electron motion .",
    "however , we expect the qualitative trends ( bump - on - tail formation , approximate location of the local maximum ) to be well represented by the model adopted here .",
    "finally , we have restricted this study to consider only fully ionized plasmas . in post - disruption plasmas with runaway mitigation by massive gas injection of high-@xmath95 atoms , where temperatures are often below @xmath52ev ,",
    "both the bremsstrahlung and elastic scattering cross - sections are modified to account for the presence of bound electrons , due to incomplete screening of the charged nucleus at large incident energies .",
    "these effects would act to increase both the synchrotron ( because of enhanced pitch - angle scattering ) and bremsstrahlung losses compared to the predictions of our model , and a more detailed description of the atomic physics involved would be required for a more accurate simulation of such scenarios .",
