    "the planetary nebula ( pn ) swst  1 ( swings & struve 1940 ) is believed to be in the incipience of this stage of evolution , because of its small angular diameter ( kwok et al 1981 ; aaquist & kwok 1990 ) and high electron density , found by various studies to have a value in the range @xmath9  @xmath11  3@xmath1210@xmath13 to 10@xmath14  @xmath1 ( flower et al .",

    "the central star of swst  1 , hd 167362 , has been classified as spectral type [ wc9 ] ( crowther et al .",
    "1998 ) , a class of h - deficient , c - rich pn central stars that exhibit emission lines indicative of strong winds , although its emission lines are weaker than typical members of this class ( tylenda et al .  1993 ; grny & tylenda 2000 ) .",
    "while the evolutionary origin of this class of stars is still unclear , it may be related to late thermal pulses ( e.g.  herwig et al .",

    "( _ fuse _ ) spectrum probes material along a narrow `` pencil - beam '' toward the central star , and therefore samples a very small portion of the nebula compared to emission line studies .",
    "the _ fuse _ waveband includes the resonance lyman and werner bands of molecular hydrogen , several lines of and ( which we use to derive the fe abundance in swst  1 ) , and  @xmath161088.46 , which has been used previously to derive the ge abundance of five pne ( sterling et al .",

    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "we discuss the method of analysis in  3 , and present the voigt component fits used to derive the column densities , central velocities , and doppler spread parameters of several nebular species . in  4 , we use these results to investigate properties of the ionized gas , such as the electron density and gas phase iron abundance . we also examine neutral and molecular gas in swst  1 (  5 ) , deriving an upper limit to the column density of nebular molecular hydrogen in the line of sight , and investigating the excitation of the fine structure levels .",

    "the design ( moos et  al . 2000 ; sahnow et  al . 2000 ) consists of four prime focus telescopes and rowland - circle spectrographs with microchannel plate detectors .",
    "two of the channels are coated with al : lif , which provides optimal throughput for the spectral range 10001187  , while the other two have sic coatings for optimal reflectivity below 1000  .",

    "we used calfuse  ( v2.0.5 ) , the standard reduction pipeline available at johns hopkins university , to calibrate the raw data .",
    "the exposures were then cross - correlated and co - added in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we rebinned the data by three pixels , which improved the average s / n to @xmath1115 - 25 per rebinned sample , depending on the region of the spectrum .",
    "this increased the effective pixel size from @xmath11  7  m  to @xmath11  20  m , corresponding to a velocity sampling interval of @xmath11  6.0  km  s@xmath19 near 1000    and @xmath11  5.2  km  s@xmath19 near 1150   .",

    ", the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath6 are forced to be the same for all lines from a given level ( although the central velocities may differ by a small offset , particularly for lines measured by different instruments ) .",
    "simultaneous fitting is especially important for the medium - resolution _ fuse _ spectrum , where saturation may not be evident due to instrumental broadening .",
    "we use this technique in several cases to test the importance of saturation effects , and to constrain the parameters of mildly saturated lines which , if modeled individually , would otherwise be highly uncertain .",
    "this procedure is most useful when the fitted lines have significantly different @xmath28-values , and at least one is not saturated .",
    "we use a different line fitting method in this paper than in previous work for the same dataset ( sdb ) .",
    "while we measure several more nebular lines in swst  1 than sdb reported , our two studies have lines of , and in common . by comparing our table  1 with table  1 of sdb",
    ", one may note that the column densities we measure here are systematically higher than those of sdb , by about 0.3  dex ( a factor of two ) .",
    "this is not due to differences in the atomic data used ; indeed , the @xmath28-values for  @xmath29 are _ larger _ in morton ( 2003 ) than morton ( 1991 ) .",
    "the difference is likely due to the fact that we account for saturation effects in the present study .",
    "we consider the results presented in this paper to be more robust than those of sdb , since we utilize simultaneous fitting , and more recent atomic data ( morton 2003 ) and solar abundances ( asplund et al .  2004 ) .      given the low excitation of the swst  1 emission line spectrum ( dm01 ; dfp87 ) , it is not surprising that the only nebular species we detect in the _ fuse _ spectrum are neutrals and low ions : , , , , , and . of these ions",
    ", s@xmath30 requires the highest energy to create ( 23.3 ev ) , which is quite modest by pn standards .",
    "there is no evidence of absorption from more highly ionized species .    in table  1",
    ", we show the results of the line fits for all detected nebular species .",
    "two lines are listed in column  1 when a simultaneous fit was performed , while one line is recorded otherwise .",
    "the quoted 1-@xmath31 error estimates include continuum placement and statistical fit uncertainties .",
    "we estimated the statistical errors with monte carlo simulations of the absorption line profiles  100 artificial spectra were generated for each profile , with the data points modified within the errors of the gaussian noise . in most cases , the systematic errors from continuum placement dominate the uncertainties .    for lines arising from different levels of the same ion",
    ", we further constrain their fits by forcing the lines to have the same @xmath26 and @xmath27 , although the column densities of the levels are allowed to differ .",
    "this is a useful constraint for ions which exhibit absorption lines from several excited levels ( , , and ) , some of which may be saturated . since the excitation energies of the ground term levels for these three ions ( @xmath32  ev ) are small compared to the gas temperature ( 0.9  ev for @xmath33  k ; dm01 )",
    ", the same value of @xmath27 should apply for lines from all the observed levels of these ions .",
    "the results of table  1 are presented graphically in figures  2a and 2b , where the continuum - normalized profiles are displayed versus heliocentric velocity ( all velocities reported in this paper are in the heliocentric frame ) .",
    "note that the line of sight toward swst  1 intersects two interstellar components , one near @xmath34  km  s@xmath19 , and the other at + 20  km  s@xmath19 ( these are seen most clearly in the profile fits to and ) .",
    "these absorbing clouds are well - separated in velocity from nebular absorption . the profiles of  @xmath351250.58 , 1253.81 and  @xmath351304.86 , 1306.83 are from stis data , while all others are from the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "the total model fit to each line profile ( convolved with the instrumental spread function ) is shown as a thick , solid line ; thin , dashed lines represent individual component fits _ before _",

    "nearby absorption from other species is indicated in the figures .",
    "the central velocities we measure agree well with the findings of dinerstein et al .",
    "( 1995b ) , who used high resolution observations of the  @xmath355889 , 5895 doublet to find a heliocentric velocity of @xmath36  km  s@xmath19 for the circumstellar gas .",
    "this agreement is somewhat surprising , since ionized species will not necessarily absorb at the same velocity as neutral sodium , which has an ionization potential of only 5.1  ev .",
    "note that the species with the most aberrant nebular velocities , and , are blended with a heavily saturated interstellar component , and @xmath26 is highly uncertain .",
    "sulfur absorption lines are useful for calibrating the abundances of other elements , as well as for determining the average electron density @xmath9 along the line of sight .",
    "while the excited levels of the @xmath37 ground term are scantly occupied in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , their populations can be significant in the physical conditions of pne .",
    "nebular resonance lines are often blended with saturated ism components , but lines from the excited levels do not suffer from this effect .",
    "the column densities of the excited levels can thus be used to determine the column density of the ground state , under the usual assumption of statistical equilibrium .",
    "since the nebular components of the resonance transitions of at @xmath351012.50 , 1190.20 are lost in the saturated ism components and blends with other species , we use absorption lines of @xmath38 and @xmath39 to extrapolate the ground state column density , and subsequently derive the total ionic column density .",
    "the populations of these levels are also sensitive to @xmath9 , and we use the column density ratios to derive the line of sight electron density",
    ".    voigt component fits to and profiles are depicted in figure  2a , with the fit parameters detailed in table  1 .",
    "we detected absorption from both excited levels of , at @xmath161015.78 and @xmath351021.11 , 1021.32 , in the _ fuse _ spectrum . since only one @xmath38 line provided useful information ( the other lines in the _ fuse _ and stis wavebands are too severely blended and/or saturated to significantly constrain the fit ) , we chose to simultaneously fit @xmath38 and @xmath39 , fixing @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but allowing the column densities of the two levels to differ .    the ground term of consists of a single level , so its ionic column density is given by the simultaneous fit of  @xmath351250.58 , 1253.81 .",
    "@xmath161259.52 is more heavily saturated , and does not significantly constrain the ionic column density when simultaneously fit with the other lines of the multiplet .",
    "the two lines we fit are mildly saturated , and therefore the derived column density is not well determined , but this ion does not contribute a significant amount of the total column of s.      in order to extrapolate the ground state population of from those of the excited levels , we used the 5-level task `` nebular.ionic '' by shaw & dufour ( 1995 ) in iraf , assuming the electron temperature @xmath40  k and density @xmath41  @xmath1 derived from nebular emission lines ( dm01 ) .",
    "however , at such a high density , the predicted ratio @xmath42  @xmath43@xmath44/@xmath43@xmath39 )  =  0.96 ( hereafter , @xmath45 refers to the population ratio of the @xmath46 to the @xmath47 levels above the ground state ) is nearly a factor of two smaller than the observed value of 1.74@xmath480.38 .",
    "note that saturation effects in @xmath38  @xmath161015.78 can not explain the discrepancy , for if this line were saturated , then @xmath49 would be even larger than the observed value .",
    "furthermore , line - fit uncertainties are unable to bring the observed and predicted line ratios into accord  forcing the column densities to have a ratio of 0.96 leads to an inferior fit ( higher @xmath50 ) for any value of @xmath27 .",
    "we therefore explored the sensitivity of @xmath49 to the adopted atomic data and physical parameters .",
    "using more recent transition probabilities for ( nahar 1993 ) than the default values for the nebular.ionic task ( mendoza & zeippen 1982 ) has almost no effect on the relative populations of the ground term levels .",
    "however , it should be noted that both sets of values assume ls coupling , which predicts the same relative oscillator strengths of lines within a multiplet .",
    "we also found that varying the electron temperature within a reasonable range ( 515@xmath51  k ) has little effect on the predicted level populations . on the other hand , @xmath52 is sensitive to the assumed electron density , and increases as @xmath9 decreases . in table  2 , we show the predicted values of @xmath53 and @xmath49 for @xmath40  k and a range of electron densities .",
    "the model agrees best with the observed @xmath54 at @xmath55  @xmath1 , with the 1-@xmath31 errors allowing for the range @xmath5613600  @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that the observed column density ratio @xmath49 is inconsistent with an electron density as high as reported by dm01 , @xmath41  @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that dm01 derived the electron density from the optical doublet ratio [ ]  @xmath164072/@xmath166725 .",
    "the @xmath57 lines have high critical densities , and are therefore biased toward dense regions of the nebula .",
    "other density diagnostics , such as [ ]  @xmath58 and [ ]  @xmath59 , imply @xmath60  @xmath1 , but are unreliable since they are near their high density limits .",
    "therefore , the [ ]  @xmath164072/@xmath166725 density indicator is the most reliable one measured by dm01 . using the same diagnostic ratio ,",
    "dfp87 also derived a high electron density , @xmath61  @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible that the more highly ionized portion of the nebula has a lower density than that occupied by singly ionized species .",
    "however , this argument is weakened by the fact that flower et al .",
    "( 1984 ) derived @xmath61  @xmath1 from iue observations of ]  @xmath62 .",
    "is it possible that the nebular gas along the line of sight to the central star of swst  1 has a significantly lower density than other regions of the nebula ?",
    "since the absorption occurs along a `` pencil beam '' sample of the nebular gas in front of the central star , and thus samples a much smaller portion of the nebula than emission line studies , the electron density could be this low if the nebula is inhomogeneous .",
    "other results (   4.2 , 5.1 ) indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "we adopt @xmath0  @xmath1 and @xmath40  k to derive @xmath63 ( see table  2 ) .",

    "the adopted column densities for the ground term levels of are summarized in table  3 .      since the _ fuse _",
    "observations do not provide a means of directly determining the overall column density of ionized gas @xmath6(h@xmath65 ) , we derive the fe abundance in swst  1 by using sulfur as a reference element .",
    "s is particularly useful for this purpose , since it is not significantly depleted into dust in the diffuse ism ( e.g.  sembach & savage 1996 ; welty et  al .",
    "1999 ) , nor is it affected by nucleosynthesis in the progenitor star .",
    "because we do not observe all ionization stages of fe , we use appropriate ionic ratios as surrogates for the elemental abundances . and have a similar ionization potential range to and ( 7.930.7 ev for fe@xmath65 and fe@xmath30 , 10.434.8 ev for s@xmath65 and s@xmath30 ) , and therefore we assume that @xmath43fe@xmath65  +  fe@xmath30)/@xmath43s@xmath65  +  s@xmath30 )  @xmath11  ( fe / s ) .",
    "we use the recommended solar abundances of asplund et al .",

    "the column densities of some of these levels could not be measured directly , because absorption lines from the levels were undetected or saturated .",
    "therefore , we computed the populations for these unobserved levels with models .",
    "we describe the methods used in the following subsections , before presenting the derived fe abundance",
    ".      only resonance transitions of are detected , despite the fact that this ion has several low - energy levels which may be significantly populated .",
    "the populations of the excited levels must therefore be predicted by models in order to correctly compute the total ionic column density .",
    "iron is not included in the nebular.ionic task , so we use xstar ( kallman & bautista 2001 ) photoionization models to calculate fe ionic level populations .",
    "xstar utilizes atomic data from the iron project ( hummer et  al .",
    "1993 ; see bautista & kallman 2001 and references therein ) , and computes populations of numerous levels for each ion .",

    "while fe@xmath65 may reside in the photodissociation region as well as the region , we find a relatively small total column density of fe@xmath65 compared to fe@xmath30 , so that uncertainties in the level populations have little effect on the derived fe abundance .",

    "( we cite only a lower limit for @xmath156 , since the ratios become insensitive to the precise value for @xmath171  k. ) it is interesting to note that optical and near - infrared line ratios indicate that stellar continuum fluorescence is important in _ all four _ of these pne ( bd+30@xmath1313639  aller & hyung 1995 , rudy et al .",

    ", yielding lower temperatures ( @xmath172400  k ) and much higher densities ( log(@xmath168/@xmath173 ) for these pne .",
    "the reason for this difference is not clear .",
    "one possible source of the discrepancy is the correction for c / o , which is uncertain by as much as a factor of 23 in pne .",
    "another factor is that the _ iso _ observations were taken with a larger entrance aperture than the _ kao _ data , and may include a greater contribution from more extended , cooler gas , where the stellar radiation field is weaker and collisional excitation dominates .",
    "thus , the contribution of the fluorescently excited component may be diluted compared to that seen by _",
    "kao_.    this effect has probably been seen , albeit not recognized , in other sources such as the @xmath174  oph cloud ( liseau et al . 1999a ) and carina nebula ( mizutani et al .  2004 ) , where excess emission is seen in the 145  @xmath10 line compared to the predictions of pdr models and other diagnostics of gas temperature . indeed , liseau et al .",
    "( 1999a ) specifically suggest that an unidentified nonthermal pumping mechanism may be responsible ( also see liseau et al .",
    "our _ fuse _ observations of swst  1 provide an explanation for this widespread puzzle .",
    "many of the physical properties that we derive from the _ fuse _ spectrum of swst  1  the electron density , the high gaseous iron abundance , and the absence of nebular h@xmath5 absorption  differ dramatically from values derived previously from emission lines .",
    "however , _ fuse _ probes only a `` pencil - beam '' of gas in the line of sight to the central star , a small portion of the nebula compared to emission line studies ; the differences therefore suggest that the absorption line of sight is not representative of conditions elsewhere in the nebula .",
    "these results indicate a non - uniform distribution of ionized and molecular material in swst  1 , either due to a highly asymmetrical global structure , or extreme clumping .",
    "it is possible that global structure can explain the observations .",
    "the images of the optical emission in dm01 suggest a toroidal morphology , tipped with respect to our line of sight .",
    "( assuming that the optical nebula is really a circular ring , the observed aspect ratio implies an inclination of @xmath1160  from pole - on . ) in this case , the _ fuse _ spectrum looks through a polar cone in which the gas has mostly been evacuated .",
    "the line of sight to the central star , which traverses this cone , would then be a region deficient in both molecules and dust , where the gas density is low compared to the toroidal ring .",
    "alternatively , small - scale clumping may be responsible for the nebular inhomogeneities .",
    "in fact , such clumpiness may be quite common in pne .",
    "for example , odell et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find numerous knots in nearby pne , and gonalves et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discuss 50 pne with detected low ionization structures .",
    "small - scale structure may form quite early in the evolution of a pn , from instabilities created during the interaction of the fast and slow winds ( dwarkadas & balick 1998 ) or with the passage of the ionization front ( e.g.  garca - segura & franco 1996 ) .",
    "condensations in the progenitor s envelope during the agb phase could also contribute to knots in the ejecta ( dyson et  al .",
    "1989 ) , although huggins & mauron ( 2002 ) find a lack of evidence that this occurs .",
    "recent studies have shown that pne with h - deficient central stars ( such as swst  1 ) may be particularly likely to form clumpy nebulae .",
    "acker et al .  ( 2002 ) and pea et al .  ( 2003 ) find that pne with [ wc ] central stars tend to exhibit a higher degree of turbulence ( which implies the presence of small - scale instabilities ) than those with h - rich stars .",
    "indeed , the high metal abundance and mass - loss rates of [ wc ] central stars likely prolong the momentum - conserving phase of the nebula ( acker et  al .",
    "2002 ) , which is prone to nonlinear thin shell instabilities ( dwarkadas & balick 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , clumpy winds from [ wc ] central stars , as detected by grosdidier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , can create or enhance inhomogeneities in the nebula . while grosdidier et  al .",
    "did not detect inhomogeneous outflows from the central star of swst  1 , they acknowledge that their observations were insufficient to detect wind variability on timescales longer than about an hour .",
    "however , they detected clumpy winds from the central stars of ngc  40 and bd+30@xmath1313639 , which are similar to that of swst  1 .",
    "since the angular scale of swst  1 is so small that even _ hst _",
    "images can not fully resolve its intrinsic structure , it is not possible to assess whether the non - uniform distribution of nebular material is due to global asymmetries or clumping .",
    "however , it is clear that the nebula is inhomogeneous , and the sight line to the central star does not intersect material with the properties exhibited by emission lines .",
    "the spatial segregation of h@xmath5 into dense regions , implied by the absence of uv h@xmath5 absorption in an object with near - ir h@xmath5 emission , is not unexpected in view of the fragility of h@xmath5 molecules to photodissociation and the intensity of the stellar uv radiation field .",
    "tielens ( 1993 ) estimated that the lifetime of h@xmath5 molecules outside of dense knots  where self shielding and dust extinction protect them from photodissociation  is on the order of a few years , and therefore predicted that h@xmath5 in pne must be confined to dense clumps .",
    "recent high spatial resolution observations of h@xmath5 and co emission in the helix and ring nebulae , where small linear dimensions can be resolved , have confirmed this expectation ( huggins et al .",
    "2002 ; speck et al .",
    "even given the relative youth of swst  1 ( estimated as @xmath11  300 yr by dm01 ) , the timescales for the propagation of photodissociation fronts are sufficiently short ( e.g.  hollenbach & natta 1995 ) that the h@xmath5 will be largely dissociated along paths which do not contain condensations with @xmath175  @xmath8 .",
    "the origin of the inhomogeneities in the gas phase fe abundance and the corresponding dust - to - gas ratio in swst  1 is less clear .",
    "our results show a difference of @xmath176 dex between the gas phase fe abundance in the uv absorption column and the emitting gas , where it is depleted by about a factor of @xmath177 , similar to values found in the warm ionized ism and regions ( sembach & savage 1996 ; welty et al .",
    "1999 ; rodrguez 2002 ) .",
    "the low optical fe@xmath30 abundance is corroborated by likkel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find similarly low fe@xmath30/h@xmath65 from near - infrared [ ] lines in swst  1 .",
    "further evidence for the presence of dust in swst  1 comes from the detection of thermal dust emission in the infrared .",
    "swst  1 exhibits the dual dust chemistry that is typical of pne with [ wc ] central stars ( cohen et  al .",
    "2002 ) , as indicated by the presence of features from both o - rich ( aitken et  al .  1979 ; zhang & kwok 1990 ) and c - rich dust ( roche et  al .",
    "1996 ; szczerba et al .",
    "the o - rich grains dominate by mass : silicates account for about 95% of the dust , with the other 5% giving rise to the aromatic emission bands usually attributed to pahs ( casassus et al .",
    "2001 ) . on general considerations , fe should be strongly depleted in regions with abundant silicate grains ( draine 2003 ) , and has also been found to be underabundant in nebulae with c - rich dust ( e.g. shields 1978 ;  perinotto et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "there are two possible scenarios that could produce the observed difference in fe depletion between the absorption column and the emitting regions .",
    "if the ejected material initially had a uniform dust - to - gas ratio , then the dust must have been destroyed more efficiently in lower density regions of the nebula .",
    "alternatively , variations in dust formation or growth efficiency in a clumpy outflow could have caused a non - uniform dust - to - gas ratio , and the initial inhomogeneity remains imprinted on the evolving nebula .",
    "the main dust destruction agents in nebulae are shocks and energetic stellar photons .",
    "although the central star of swst  1 drives a fast wind ( 900  km  s@xmath19 ; dm01 ) , the wind - shocked gas should lie in the central cavity , and be highly ionized and heated to @xmath178  k ( e.g.  chu et al .",
    "shocks moving into the dense optically emitting material would be much slower ( tielens 1993 ) , and therefore less able to destroy the dust .",
    "the fact that we measure radial velocities for the uv absorption lines that are consistent with the overall expansion velocity of the optical emitting gas ( dm01 ) argues that the absorbing gas was not accelerated by a shock .",
    "in addition , the ionization balance seen from the uv absorption lines is consistent with that indicated by the emission lines .",
    "therefore , based on kinematic and excitation arguments , shock processing of the gas and dust in swst  1 seems improbable .    unlike h@xmath5 molecules , dust grains are relatively robust with respect to evaporation by stellar radiation , with the exception of small grains ( containing fewer than 2030 atoms ) that have small heat capacities relative to the energies of typical stellar uv photons .",
    "these small grains can not re - radiate the absorbed photon energy via an equilibrium process , and can undergo large temperature fluctuations .",
    "such grains , whether carbon or silicate - based , can be heated to temperatures exceeding the sublimation temperature of refractory elements after absorbing just one or two high - energy photons ( e.g.  guhathakurta & draine 1989 ) .",
    "observational studies have drawn mixed conclusions about radiative destruction of dust in pne . observed gas phase depletions of elements such as fe and mg",
    "do not show any clear trends with nebular age ( middlemass 1988 ; perinotto et al .",
    "similarly , it does not appear that dust - to - gas ratios derived from infrared emission are lower in older , more evolved pne ( hoare et al .  1992 ) .",
    "such arguments depend on comparing different objects , which may not be appropriate if the initial dust formation efficiency differs among their progenitor stars .",
    "another approach is to search for evidence of dust destruction within specific nebulae . in this regard , the fact that the dust - to - gas ratios derived for the ionized and neutral ( pdr ) regions in ngc  7027 agree to within a factor of two is taken as evidence against dust destruction in the ionized gas by hoare et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is evidence for a `` depletion gradient '' in some pne in the sense that some refractory elements ( e.g.  al , ca , and mg ) are less depleted in regions of higher than those of lower ionization , suggesting that atoms have been released from grains into the gas phase by the stellar radiation field ( kingdon et al .",
    "1995 ; kingdon & ferland 1997 ) .    in swst  1",
    ", we find very disparate gas phase fe depletions in different regions of the nebula _ with the same ionization states _ , which makes it seem unlikely that there has been a substantial difference in the amount of radiative dust destruction between these two regions .",
    "this indicates that the disparate fe depletions are most likely caused by initial inhomogeneities in the dust formation or growth efficiency in the agb outflow .",
    "such inhomogeneities could be caused by low temperature structures ( e.g.  starspots ) in the atmosphere of the progenitor agb star , as suggested by frank ( 1995 ) and soker & clayton ( 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the grain growth efficiency is higher in denser regions of a clumpy outflow ( e.g.  dorfi & hfner 1996 ) , so that the grain size distribution would be skewed toward larger radii in dense gas .",
    "if the density inhomogeneities are preserved into the pn phase , dust in the more rarefied gas is more susceptible to photodestruction because of the smaller grain size distribution .",
    "this implies that radiative dust destruction could have been more efficient in lower density regions of swst  1 , even though the incident radiation field is similar for the low and high density gas ( as indicated by the comparable ionization balance of the absorbing and emitting gas ) .",
    "the dust deficit in the gas probed by the uv absorption lines may have a direct influence on the amount of h@xmath5 present , since the primary channel for h@xmath5 formation is through grain surface reactions .",
    "the removal of this mechanism for reforming h@xmath5 is likely to lower the equilibrium h@xmath5 abundance that can be maintained in the presence of a dissociating and ionizing radiation field ( aleman & gruenwald 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , although we attribute the extreme contrast in the h@xmath5 abundance primarily to photodestruction , it is possible that the dust inhomogeneities amplify and maintain the spatial variations in molecular material .",
    "germanium ( @xmath179 ) isotopes can be produced by slow neutron(_n_)-capture nucleosynthesis ( the _ s_-process ) in pn progenitor stars during the agb phase of evolution .",
    "nuclei created by the _ s_-process may be convectively transported to the stellar envelope along with carbon during third dredge - up ( tdu ; e.g.  busso et  al .",
    "the fact that we find an enhanced ge abundance relative to solar in swst  1 implies that the _ s_-process and tdu were efficient in the progenitor star .    we measure a ge enrichment [ ge / s ]  =  @xmath1080.06 , or [ ge / fe ]  =  @xmath110 , which can be compared with theoretical models of stellar _",
    "s_-process enrichments , given the metallicity . the s abundance derived by dm01 and",
    "dfp87 implies that the progenitor star of swst  1 may have had a metallicity as low as @xmath180 .",
    "however , the o and ne abundances indicate that the metallicity is closer to solar .",
    "the derived ge overabundance is slightly larger than predicted by recent theoretical models of the _ s_-process in this metallicity range ( busso et  al .",
    "2001 ; busso 2003 , private communication ; goriely & mowlavi 2000 ) . however , many uncertainties exist in the strength of tdu and in the effect of convective overshoot and rotation on the _ s_-process ( e.g.  herwig et  al .  2003 ; siess et  al .",

    "we find [ fe / s ]  =  @xmath800.12 or @xmath183 , depending on the adopted @xmath28-values .",
    "the gaseous iron abundance is insensitive to uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath69 , and is high in comparison to interstellar medium values , and to the fe abundance derived from optical [ ] emission lines in swst  1 ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 and [ fe / s]@xmath4 ) .",
    "this indicates the presence of marked inhomogeneities in the dust - to - gas ratio in different regions of the nebula .",

    "thus , the elemental ge abundance lies at the low end of the range suggested by sdb .",
    "we re - derive [ ge / s ] and find a value of 0.72@xmath480.06 .",

    "apparently , little of this molecular material lies along the line of sight to the central star .",
    "the low electron density , non - detection of nebular h@xmath5 , and high gaseous fe abundance derived from the _ fuse _ spectrum of swst  1 implies that the gas lying in the direction of the central star has markedly different properties from the regions of the nebula sampled by emission lines . since the _ fuse _ spectrum samples only the gas along the line of sight toward the central star , this indicates that both the ionized and molecular gas in swst  1 are non - uniformly distributed .",
