    "furthermore , we can clearly demonstrate that this difference arises due to the finite thickness effect , or the fact that slmos@xmath0 actually contains three planes of atoms .",
    "specifically , eq . ( [ eq_d3 ] ) shows that nearly 36% of the bending modulus , or 3.49 ev , arises from the contribution of the two - body snn interactions between s atoms that lie on the same plane . because there are two planes of s atoms in slmos@xmath0",
    ", we find that each plane of s atoms contributes about 1.75 ev to the bending modulus .",
    "this value is similar to the 1.4 ev value for monolayer graphene@xcite .",
    "however , due to the three planes of atoms , slmos@xmath0 receives additional , out of plane contributions to its bending modulus .",
    "specifically , the fnn mo - s interactions contribute about 3.09 ev , or 32% of the total bending modulus , while the three - body ( angular ) mo - s interactions between mo and s atoms on the same plane , contributes 2.75 ev , or about 29% of the bending rigidity .",
    "not surprisingly , the three - body interactions between s atoms on different planes contributes only 0.29 ev , or about 3% to the total bending modulus .",
    "overall , the two - body ( pair ) terms contribute about 6.58 , or 68% of the total bending rigidity .",
    "this means that the angular ( three - body ) contribution in slmos@xmath0 of about 29% is smaller than the 41% contribution that the dihedral angles were found to make to the bending modulus in monolayer graphene@xcite .",
    "[ 1.0 ] from molecular mechanics method for zigzag ( triangles , blue online ) and armchair ( circles , red online ) directions .",
    "the analytic result , @xmath116 , is shown by the dashed line .",
    "deviations between molecular mechanics and analytic results are due to nonlinearity at large bending curvature.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    to validate the analytic results , we compute the bending modulus of slmos@xmath0 using the same sw potential using the molecular mechanics method . fig .",
    "[ fig_energy_density ] shows the strain energy density for slmos@xmath0 nanotubes .",
    "the tubes are obtained by rolling up the slmos@xmath0 into a cylindrical structure , with the middle mo atomic layer purely bent .",
    "both armchair and zigzag tubes are calculated .",
    "the energy is calculated for this ideally rolled up tube structure without optimization ( energy minimization ) , because the optimization is not considered in the above analytic derivation . as we have pointed out above , the optimization of the shift degree of freedom between the mo and s planes of atoms does not contribute to the bending modulus .",
    "however , the optimization of the whole unit cell ( with one mo and two s atoms ) can slightly decrease the total energy of the system , and represents a more accurate value .",
    "our analytic value of 9.61 ev is about 16% larger than the value ( 8.03  ev ) obtained from the mm method with optimization and relaxation of all degrees of freedom . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_energy_density ] denotes the analytic result , @xmath117 , with @xmath118  ev .",
    "good agreement is observed between the analytic result and the numerical data for curvature smaller than 0.12 .",
    "some obvious discrepancy appears for curvature larger than 0.12 , which is due to the neglect of nonlinear terms in the analytic derivation .",
    "it should be noted that for graphene , the analytic result agrees with the molecular mechanics calculation up to a curvature value around 0.25,@xcite which is much larger than the value of 0.12 reported here .",
    "this is quite reasonable , considering the finite thickness and more complicated tri - layer configuration in slmos@xmath0 .",
    "finally , we compare our result with those that can be obtained by taking recent experimental measurements for the elastic properties of slmos@xmath0 , and using them in the classical bending modulus expression for thin elastic structures , @xmath5 .",
    "to do so , we note that recently ,  @xcite have found @xmath119 n / m for slmos@xmath0 , while  @xcite found @xmath120 n / m for slmos@xmath0 . given those values , we consider @xmath121 to range from 120 - 240 n / m , while taking @xmath122@xcite , and the thickness @xmath123   . taking these values",
    "gives an experimental range for the bending modulus @xmath3 from 6.62 to 13.24 ev .",
    "our obtained value of 9.61 ev clearly fits into this range .",
    "in conclusion , we derived an analytic formula for the elastic bending modulus of the slmos@xmath0 , which does not require the definition of a thickness for slmos@xmath0 .",
    "the obtained elastic bending modulus is 9.61  ev for slmos@xmath0 , which is significantly larger than the elastic bending modulus of graphene , is found to be within the range of values that are obtained using thin shell theory with experimentally obtained values for the elastic constants of slmos@xmath0 .",
    "it is found that the finite thickness of the slmos@xmath0 plays a key role in determining its bending properties . specifically , while each monolayer of s atoms has a bending rigidity ( 1.75 ev ) similar to that of monolayer graphene ( 1.4 ev ) , the additional pairwise and angular interactions between mo and s atoms contributes 5.84 ev to the bending modulus of slmos@xmath0 .",
