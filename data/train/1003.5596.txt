    "the 850 @xmath1 m polarization pattern of omc-3 measured with scuba and studied by @xcite shows that a helical magnetic field ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the change in orientation between the polarization data and the filamentary axis to the south of omc-3 could be accounted for by either a bend of the filament or the presence of a second filament , oriented roughly orthogonal to the primary isf .",
    "if the latter interpretation is correct , then polarization vectors realigning with the filamentary axis are expected south of omc-3 .",
    "if the filament continues to bend , then any orientation of vectors to the filament axis is possible .",
    "our initial motivation for this project was to measure the 850 @xmath1 m polarization pattern of omc-2 with the aim to better understand the structure of the magnetic field south of omc-3 .",
    "then , with the availability of 350 @xmath1 m polarization data by @xcite and estimates of the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the line - of - sight ( los ) at several places along the filament , a global comparison with the 850 @xmath1 m polarization vectors observed in both regions can be made .",

    "[ polmap ] we have identified this faint condensation by `` mms11 '' .    with the data in omc-2 , we now see that a realignment of the polarization pattern with the filamentary structure is effective just to the south of omc-3 , near fir1 .",

    "given the strong flux emission along certain lines of sight , the region of fir 1 and fir 2 was distinguished from the region of fir 3 to fir 5 .",
    "the region of fir 6 was combined with the southernmost part of the map ; these two areas contain a lot of pixels where no polarization was detected .",

    "@xcite imaged co outflows at @xmath79 resolution near several protostellar sources in omc-2 and omc-3 .",
    "the outflow properties including their lengths are summarized in their table 1 .",
    "we have directly used figures 3 to 6 of their work to estimate the central coordinates and position angles of the molecular outflows spread along the filaments .",
    "unbiased h@xmath4 surveys for protostellar jets in orion a were also conducted by @xcite .",
    "the positions , p.a.s , and lengths of the h@xmath4 features are listed in the table 3 of @xcite .",
    "since it was shown by @xcite that some of the jets can not be associated with omc-3 cores , only those associated with cs cores in omc-3 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are considered in the following analysis .",
    "all existing data associated with driving sources in omc-2 and omc-3 were used with the 850 @xmath1 m data to produce a map where the polarization pattern is superimposed on jets and outflow p.a.s .",
    "figure [ jo ] shows such a map where co outflows and h@xmath4 jet lengths are appropriately scaled .",
    "co outflows originating from mms2/mms3 , mms5 , mms7 , mms8 , mms9 , mms10 , fir1bc , fir2 and fir3 are shown as red lines and marked with a red full square symbol .",
    "this symbol shows the location of the @xcite dust condensations , but because many possible progenitors can be seen through fir1bc and fir2 , they only indicate the geometrical centers of these flows .",

    "all of the h@xmath4 jets included here are members of the `` certain '' group defined by @xcite where flows are identified on morphological grounds .",
    "the coordinates are thus representative coordinates , meaning that if there is a candidate driving source , its position is given ; alternatively , if the location of a possible driving source is suggested on morphological grounds like for example , the geometric center of an apparently bipolar h@xmath4 configuration , this position is given .    on this basis a statistical study of the angular offsets on the pos between jets or outflows p.a.s and the p.a.s of the polarization vectors was carried out .",
    "the closest vectors on either side along the projected lengths were selected with the distance between polarization vectors and flows being never higher than 18.6@xmath80 ; more typically , the distance is a few @xmath80 .",
    "each selected vector was used no more than one time .",
    "each resulting mean angular offset is thus the difference between the p.a . of the outflow / jets and the mean of subsets of two to nine polarization p.a.s .",
    "finally , we note that no jets are seen in the region south of fir6 @xcite and that the co observations of @xcite did not cover this region .",
    "a summary of our results is given in table [ jets ] where designations of the flows , the coordinates of the central source or of the central position , estimates of their p.a.s , estimates of the mean p.a.s of subsets of submm vectors in their vicinity and offsets between these p.a .",
    "estimates are displayed .",
    "a histogram of the angular offsets between each polarization position angle and jet / outflow orientation on the pos can be seen in figure [ histo_jo ] .",
    "a histogram of the mean angular offsets from table [ jets ] is also shown by a dashed line . with only twenty mean offset estimates , it is difficult to argue that the distribution is random rather than normal .",
    "so to make a first test , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the 161 angular offsets is shown in figure [ ks ] .",
    "the straight dotted - line is the cdf expected for an infinite perfectly random sample .",
    "the distribution of the complete flow sample follows this line reasonably closely . with this sample",
    "we find that , statistically , the null hypothesis from a kolmogorov test is accepted , meaning that the observed distribution is compatible with a random distribution and that the group of flows we compiled could be randomly oriented with respect to the polarization pattern of omc-2 and omc-3 .",
    "similarly , a @xmath81 test applied to the observed distribution compared to the random distribution shows with great probability that these two distributions are similar .",
    "based on the statistical tests presented in section [ jetsout ] , we conclude that no correlation is evident between the relative orientation of jets or outflows and polarization vectors on the pos .",
    "this conclusion is similar to that of @xcite in the taurus molecular cloud complex , an active star - forming region containing no massive stars . in their study , using absorption polarimetry data , these authors show that t tauri stars as a group are apparently oriented randomly with respect to the local magnetic field .",
    "this indicates that even if the cloud s magnetic field is dominant at large scale , its influence largely decreases on the much smaller scale of individual objects unless the orientation of these individual objects has changed since birth .",
    "the situation seems to be the same in the omc-3/2 regions .",
    "this scenario also implies that if turbulence generated by the outflows is able to misalign grains in the envelopes of the cores , this effect can not be seen on the pos with the resolution of the jcmt . for a distance @xmath82 pc ,",
    "this means that , independently of their orientation relative to the line of sight , the energy injected by co ouflows and h@xmath4 jets into the clouds appears not to have any impact on the polarization patterns which are observed with the presence of jets and outflows on scales of @xmath83 au .",
    "in addition , detections of polarized co emission are now available . a good introduction about the subject and a summary of some results is given by @xcite .",
    "some detections were established by @xcite in ngc 1333 iras 4a ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by @xcite toward the galactic center and in the molecular clouds s140 and dr21",
    ". when the optical depth , @xmath11 , and the spatial distribution of the gas and of the magnetic fields are favorable , it is possible to detect co polarization vectors perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "except in the `` 2 pc ring '' where the optical depth @xmath11 is relatively high , positive detections found in the other regions are consistent with orientations of magnetic fields inferred by submm dust polarimetry .",
    "thus , at the scales of their spatial resolution , these works suggest that the energy injected by jets and flows should have no substantial impact on the net polarization produced by dust grains aligned in the clouds .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the omc-3 north region where the well - defined polarization pattern suggests that whatever the inclination angle relative to the line of sight of the jets and flows , as well as their orientation on the pos , the energy injection rate has no influence on the alignment of dust grains seen at the scale of the observations . in mms7",
    "the outflow is oriented perpendicular to the 850 @xmath1 m polarization vectors covering this area .",
    "this means that if the situation is the same as in ngc 1333 iras 4a @xcite , polarized co emission vectors should be seen perpendicular to these vectors . in mms8 , 9 & 10 , the analysis of the situation is different since in this part of the sky the polarization pattern orientation may be due to another superimposed crossing filament or by a bend of the filament ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the association of jets and outflows with their probable progenitors is not always certain because of overlapping effects on the sky , a better understanding of the magnetic field structure producing the submm polarization pattern observed in the southern part of omc-3 and in the northern part of omc-2 added to polarized co emission observations could help to constrain these associations .",
    "the analysis of the situation in omc-2 is not exactly the same since some of the high intensity regions are devoid of detections .",
    "however , in regions where polarization vectors have a s / n ratio such that @xmath84 the general conclusion about the relative orientation of the jets / outflows with the submm polarization vectors discussed above is still valid .",
    "the second - order structure function of the polarization angles is defined as the average of the squared difference between the polarization angle measured at two points separated by a distance @xmath85 ( see equation ( 5 ) given by * ? ? ?",
    "once applied to a grid of pixels containing polarization position angle information , a fit to the square root of this function , namely , the angular dispersion function ( adf ) , gives a method to estimate the turbulent contribution to the total angular dispersion .",

    "abundances of molecular species and clumping studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggest an evolutionary effect from north to south along omc-2/3 .",
    "the two regions could have different ages and omc-3 could be younger than omc-2 .",
    "this could explain why omc-2 and omc-3 are so different from the point of view of submm polarization data .",
    "on the other hand , the situation is not so clear since takahashi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that some intermediate mass objects can be at a more evolved stage in omc-3 than in omc-2 .",
    "another explanation could invoke some effects of the radiation field .",
    "since omc-3 is at an higher distance to omc-1 than is omc-2 , the local isrf dominated by the bright stars located in the nebulae in front of omc-1 could be more efficient to shape the omc-2 region than the omc-3 region .",
    "the two regions , omc-2 and omc-3 , could have the same age but the erosion produced by the local isrf could be stronger on omc-2 than on omc-3 .",

    "we find no specific correlation meaning that the decrease of the polarization degree observed appears independent of turbulent flows or turbulent effects that could be present into the densest regions of the cloud . on the other hand , the variation of the the mean polarization degrees , @xmath101 , with the turbulent angular dispersion estimates",
    ", @xmath87 , of the regions considered in table [ subregions ] and shown in figure [ pmeanvsb ] suggests an anti - correlation between the two parameters .",
    "if this trend is real , it would mean that , independently of the ordered magnetic field structure component , the mean polarization degree observed in a given region could be a function of the turbulent magnetic field component . to test this hypothesis",
    "we did a linear fit of the form @xmath102 , to the eight points displayed in figure [ pmeanvsb ] .",

    "if the trend observed in omc-2/omc-3 is consistent with the polarization properties of omc-1 we use the turbulent dispersion parameters , @xmath87 , estimated by @xcite in their table 1 and figure 3 of @xcite where median polarization ratios are displayed for different wavelengths and for several regions .",
    "the mean polarization percentage observed at 350 @xmath1 m by @xcite is @xmath111 with a dispersion @xmath112 . using figure 3 shown by @xcite and a wavelength ratio of 1.3 , a mean polarization of about 3.5 @xmath113",

    "a similar trend was observed along the pipe nebula by @xcite with @xmath116-band visible polarization data collected for about 12000 stars . in this case",
    "the dispersion of several subsets of polarization position angles is used to estimate the turbulence of regions having a mean density @xmath117 @xmath118 and is compared to the mean polarization degrees of the subsets of data .",
    "the regions probed in the pipe nebula have densities about an order of magnitude lower than the density considered in our calculations where submm data would mostly probe the inner fields embedded in the filaments .",
    "the estimates of the mean field strength displayed in table [ subregions ] for regions mms1 to mms7 and fir3 to fir5 are of the same order .",
    "this result dismisses the hypothesis that the dust grain alignment efficiency could decrease with the magnetic field strength .",
    "in addition , mean inclination angles of the magnetic field from the los were estimated by @xcite to vary from about @xmath119 to about @xmath120 in three dense regions displayed along omc-2/omc-3 .",
    "if these inclination angles are representative of the mean inclination angle of the magnetic field along the filaments and if the grains are aligned with roughly the same efficiency everywhere then the degree of polarization would not be very sensitive to this parameter .",
    "these two points do not dismiss the possibility that the mean polarization degree of some regions could be a function of the level of turbulence in the region , but nor do they rule out the possibility of complex structures of an ordered magnetic field component . in cases where the large scale magnetic field dominates over the turbulence it could be that some superposition effects along the loss would produce a decrease of the polarization degree with an increase of the polarization position angle dispersion over some regions .",
    "these aspects are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the turbulent - to - mean magnetic field strengths ratios displayed in table [ subregions ] imply intensities of the turbulent magnetic component about 6 to 7 times lower than the mean magnetic field component into the omc-3 filaments .",
    "this ratio supports the steady state magnetic field approach proposed by @xcite and applied to the omc-3 region as discussed by @xcite . in the work of @xcite the maximum polarization degree is calibrated with submm observations and dust grains",
    "are aligned perpendicular to the magnetic fields .",
    "the combination of toroidal with poloidal magnetic fields components leads to superposition effects along the same line - of - sight .",
    "this geometrical effect decreases the net polarization on the pos and renders uniform magnetic fields indistinguishable from a helical field geometry .",
    "the model can reproduce the @xmath121 density profile is the radial distance , in cylindrical coordinates . ]",
    "observed by @xcite and could explain the depolarization observed along the spine of the filament .",
    "a similar approach was followed by @xcite with a focus on molecular cloud cores and shows that tangling of the magnetic field orientations by the effects of gravity could produce polarization maps showing an significant angular dispersion from the mean uniform field . since it is not clear that omc-2 is a clear case of a magnetically dominated region with respect to the turbulence , it would be interesting to test under which conditions steady - state magnetic models could reproduce the polarization properties observed in this region .",
    "the statistical results shown in figure [ pmeanvsb ] discussed above in section [ depol ] suggest that turbulence could be a parameter regulating the mean degree of polarization observed in a given polarization map .",
    "one open question would be to understand to what extent mhd models could reproduce such a decrease of polarization .",
    "@xcite present results for turbulent , isothermal , three - dimensional simulations of sub / supersonic and sub / super - alfvnic cases .",
    "dust grains are assumed perfectly aligned and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "depolarization is due to the dispersion increase of the polarization position angles and is a function of the mhd regime considered as well as of the orientation of the initial uniform magnetic field with respect to the los .",
    "the dust total intensity is assumed to be proportional to the column density .",
    "the high resolution of the simulations provides less homogeneous magnetic field structures and higher density contrasts than previous models .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite show that under peculiar conditions depolarization could occur if grains embedded in dark clouds are aligned by radiative torques ( rats ) such that their long axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field . in their model ,",
    "the nonturbulent field is about 2 times stronger than the fluctuating magnetic field , a condition encountered in omc-2 ( see table [ subregions ] ) and the ordered component is assumed to be uniform and in the pos",
    ". this condition may exist along the length of the omc-2 and omc-3 filaments @xcite .",
    "additionally , the results proposed by @xcite are valid for clouds without embedded massive stars , a condition valid in omc-2/3 where forming stars are of intermediate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or lower mass .",
    "two interesting extensions to the @xcite work were proposed by @xcite and by @xcite but the analysis of the simulations is focused on the effects of rats on depolarization rather than on the effects of the turbulent regimes on depolarization .",
    "alignment by rats is not considered by @xcite but an anti - correlation between the polarization degree and the column density , with exponent @xmath122 is predicted , due to random cancellation of polarization vectors along the los .",
    "this value is close to some values obtained on larger scales in omc-2 and omc-3 under conditions which are discussed in more detail in the following section .",
    "comparisons done by @xcite between four different mhd regimes show a degeneracy between the alfvnic mach number and the angle between the mean magnetic field and the los .",
    "they discuss the effects of different resolutions on the structure function of the polarization angle and the applicability of these structure functions to the determination of turbulent cut - off scales .    a comparison of the @xmath123 resolution 850 @xmath1 m p.a .",
    "histogram displayed in figure [ anghistot ] with the results of figure 4 of @xcite would reject the presence of super - alfvnic modes in omc-3 and probably in omc-2 as well .",
    "this inference would be consistent with the lack of correlation between jets / outflows and polarization vectors discussed in section [ joimpact ] .",
    "but , as suggested in other regions by @xcite , this would not rule out the presence of super - alfvnic modes at smaller scale , in cores of about 0.25 pc in size in the omc-2/3 regions for a distance to the clouds of about @xmath124 pc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally ,",
    "because of the resolution of our data , a direct comparison of our results with the structure function of the polarization position angle calculated for different mhd regimes is not done .",
    "figure [ pmeanvsb ] illustrates that the mean polarization degree of any region could be controlled by the mhd regime but it does not give any indication about the possible effect of the mhd regime on the level of depolarization .",
    "figure [ bvsslopes ] shows an absence of correlation between the power index of the @xmath100 relation and the turbulence parameter , @xmath87 , however , and suggests that one or more phenomena other than turbulence should be considered . to inform this discussion ,",
    "we consider possible variations in column density structure and the power law index , our best quantifier of depolarization .",
    "estimates of the power indices of the five subregions from table [ subregions ] are shown as a function of the column density contrast , @xmath125 , in figure [ slopesvsdc ] . on a statistical basis",
    ", the variation of the power index with the @xmath126 is estimated by considering the several maps obtained by masking high intensity pixels above specific cutoffs .",
    "these variations of the power indices with the @xmath126s are shown by the solid lines in figure [ slopesvsdc ] .",
    "the highest @xmath126 values are derived from our original maps ( figure [ polmap ] ) . to establish the power index of lower column material , for which we assume lower fluxes to be a proxy",
    ", we methodically masked the highest pixels by using a step of 33 @xmath127/18.6@xmath114 in column density and then recalculated the @xmath126 and power index of the resulting @xmath100 relation . by repeating this process , we are able to assess the impact of lower and lower column material on @xmath77 .",
    "we stopped at the level of @xmath128 of the peak in omc-3 ( 71 of 116 pixels were used in the process ) and 30@xmath113 of the peak in omc-2 ( 108 of 135 pixels ) . below these values , divergences were observed in the estimates of @xmath77 , likely due to the small sampling statistics .    in omc-3",
    ", the power index shows almost a linear decrease from @xmath129 down to @xmath130 .",
    "the upper value suggests a first regime reflecting the statistical level of depolarization obtained when the cores and the high density flux regions are included and well represented .",
    "the lower value suggests another regime corresponding to the statistical level of depolarization obtained when the high density flux regions are avoided .",
    "along omc-2 , only a small range of variation is observed with @xmath131 , perhaps reflecting the fact that polarization was not detected in many of the brightest regions .",
    "the two regimes are illustrated by the two horizontal dashed lines shown in figure [ slopesvsdc ] .",
    "to test the possibility of two regimes , we applied the same process in reverse , preferentially masking the lowest flux pixels until reaching 31@xmath113 of the peak in omc-3 ( 31 of 116 pixels were used in the process ) and 30@xmath113 of the peak in omc-2 ( 25 of 135 pixels ) .",
    "the subsequent variations of the power index of the @xmath100 relation with the @xmath126 are plotted on figure [ slopesvsdcup ] . here again the effect of the cores seems to be under represented on larger scale in omc-2 and the power index is constant and about -0.6 in the density contrast range @xmath126 @xmath132 to @xmath133 . once the lowest density structures are avoided , however , a second regime appears and the power index is constant and about -0.4 in the density contrast range @xmath126 @xmath134 to @xmath135 .",
    "in omc-3 the power index is constant and about -0.4 in the density contrast range @xmath126 @xmath136 to @xmath137 . below a @xmath126",
    "@xmath136 the power index increases from about -0.4 to -0.2 showing the effects a reduction of the coverage mapping centered around high density regions could produce .    finally , when comparisons are done between the five subregions , the effect of the presence of the cores on the measured power index is clearer .",
    "the two regions fir3 to fir5 and mms1 to mms7 are consistent with the first regime where the cores are included since the maximum intensity pixel used to normalize the intensity of the @xmath100 relation are the same as those used in omc-2 and omc-3 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the relatively low density region fir6 and south of fir6 appears consistent with the second regime where the effects of the cores are avoided .",
    "departures from the two regimes are observed in the mms8 to mms10 and particularly fir1 & fir2 regions .",
    "the maximum intensity pixels used to normalize the intensity of the @xmath100 relation are small in these regions compared to the one used in region fir6 and south to fir6 .",
    "this makes the sizes of the samples of regions mms8 to mms10 and fir1 & fir2 too small to be representative of the density structure of one of the two apparent regimes observed on larger scale .    in conclusion ,",
    "if representative of the column density structure of the molecular cloud , the presence of cores can lead to two distinct regimes of depolarization : one with a shallower power index reflecting the cores and a steeper value representative of lower column density material .",
    "we note , as pointed out in observational works ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that dust alignment by rats could be a promising ingredient for understanding depolarization . in this framework , a possible explanation for the shallower power index in cores could be the growth of larger , non - spherical grains in dense , cold condensations . as a consequence",
    "the upper cutoff of the power - law distribution of grain sizes will be higher in maps including cores than without cores and the power index of the @xmath100 relation be lower ( see figure 6 in the work of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an alternative explanation could be an enhancement of gravity high enough to distort the magnetic field orientations in the cores .",
    "this mechanism will tend to decrease the net polarization and the values of the power index will change accordingly ( see * ? ? ? * and details given in section [ steadystate ] ) .",
    "we note that our analysis could be subject to a bias if the resolution of the instrument is too small to properly sample the column density structure of the clouds .",
    "because the @xcite interferometric mapping in omc-2/3 precludes any multi - core scenario , the analysis of our data should not be subject to a bias due to intercept of cores along the same los , a possibility discussed by @xcite .",
    "850 @xmath1 m scuba polarization data of omc-2 were homogeneously reduced in combination with archived data of omc-3 .",
    "our main results are :    \\1 . in omc-2",

    "the mean degree of polarization is lower in omc-2 than in omc-3 .",

    "a comparison of the offsets between p.a.s of co outflows / h@xmath4 jets and polarization vectors suggests that no specific orientation of these outflows relative to the polarization patterns can be found .",
    "this fact suggests that if dust grains are generally aligned with their long axis perpendicular to the magnetic field , there is no correlation between outflows and the mean magnetic field orientation on the pos , at least to the @xmath123 beam resolution of our data .",
    "\\4 . based on the hypothesis that turbulence is present along the filaments , second order structure functions of the polarization position angle show that omc-3 is a less turbulent region than omc-2 .",
    "omc-3 appears to be a clear case of a magnetically dominated region with respect to the turbulence .",
    "however for omc-2 , it is not clear that this is the case . in omc-2 and",

    "estimates of the projected magnetic field strengths associated with the objects mms6 and fir4 are calculated to be 0.19 mg and 0.13 mg , respectively .",
    "a more in - depth analysis provides estimates of the power index , @xmath77 , also known as the depolarization parameter , the dispersions obtained about the mean field orientation @xmath88 and with the angular dispersion fitting method @xmath87 , the turbulent - to - mean magnetic field strength ratio @xmath138 for five regions along omc-3 and omc-2 .",
    "we find an anti - correlation between @xmath101 , the mean polarization degree , and the turbulence parameter @xmath87 , meaning that the level of turbulence in a region could regulate the mean polarization degree observed .",
    "no specific correlation is found between @xmath77 and the turbulence parameter @xmath87 .",
    "when steady state models are considered , two scenarios can explain the polarization at the southern edge of omc-3 : a bent filament and a second filament oriented almost orthogonal to the integral shaped filament ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it remains to be quantified how the relative effects of steady state and turbulent magnetic field models contribute to the observed polarization in omc-2 .",
