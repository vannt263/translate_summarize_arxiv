    "in low - dimensional superconducting ( sc ) systems ( ultra - thin films , wires and josephson arrays ) , fluctuations of the sc order parameter field lead to broadening of the transition to the sc state , and give rise to anomalous transport properties in the adjacent normal phase @xcite . while close to or above the critical temperature @xmath6 thermally excited fluctuations dominate these conduction anomalies , quantum fluctuations are expected to dominate at low temperatures @xmath7 , where superconductivity is weakened due to , e.g. , the effect of a magnetic field , disorder or repulsive coulomb interactions .",
    "their most dramatic manifestation is the onset of a superconductor  insulator transition ( sit ) when an external parameter such as magnetic field or thickness is tuned beyond a critical point @xcite .",
    "a striking signature of the fluctuations regime , which attracted much attention in the recent years , is the anomalous enhancement of transverse thermoelectric effects in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 . in particular ,",
    "a substantial nernst effect measured far above @xmath6 , e.g. , in the underdoped regime of high-@xmath6 superconductors @xcite and disordered thin films @xcite . as the nernst signal ( a voltage developing in response to a temperature gradient in the perpendicular direction ) is typically small in ordinary metals , its magnification in such systems has been attributed to the dynamics of thermally excited gaussian sc fluctuations @xcite , or mobile vortices above a kosterlitz - thouless @xcite transition @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies were also extended to the quantum critical regime of sc fluctuations @xcite .    conceptually , the above mentioned theoretical models share a common intuitive idea : in the phase - disordered , vortex liquid state ( which is qualitatively equivalent to a regime dominated by dynamical gaussian fluctuations ) , vortex flow generated parallel to a thermal gradient ( @xmath8 ) naturally induces an electric field ( @xmath9 ) in the perpendicular direction .",
    "consequently , the general expression for the nernst coefficient @xmath10 is overwhelmingly dominated by the first term in the numerator , dictated by the off - diagonal peltier coefficient @xmath1 : sc fluctuations typically do not contribute to the second term due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with ordinary metals , where the two terms almost cancel .",
    "measurement of the nernst signal is therefore often regarded as a direct probe of @xmath1 , which is an interesting quantity : while being a transport coefficient , it is intimately related to thermodynamic properties .",
    "in particular , it was found ( both experimentally and theoretically ) to be proportional to the diamagnetic response @xcite : @xmath11 . in the clean limit ( i.e. for galilean invariant systems ) , it was shown to encode the entropy per carrier @xcite .",
    "perpendicular to the plane , and a temperature difference between the top ( @xmath12 ) and bottom ( @xmath13 ) sc wires .",
    "dashed lines represent josephson coupling .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    note , however , that even in the case where eq .",
    "( [ nernst_def ] ) is dominated by the first term , the overall contribution to @xmath14 is not determined by @xmath1 alone , but rather by its product with the electric resistivity @xmath15 .",
    "observation of a large nernst signal therefore necessitates a reasonably resistive normal state .",
    "this indicates that a large nernst signal is a subtle effect : on one hand it requires the presence of superconducting fluctuations , and on the other hand requires the superconducting fluctuations to be _ dynamic _ in order to produce a sizable voltage drop .",
    "a conjunction of these competing tendencies occurs in the fluctuations dominated regime .",
    "moreover , the nernst effect is expected to serve as a sensitive probe of a sit .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that when the normal state adjacent to the sc transition is an insulator , @xmath1 can _ not _ be directly deduced from @xmath14 : unlike most cases studied in the literature thus far , @xmath15 can not be assumed constant .",
    "rather , it possesses a significant dependence of its own on the deviation from the critical point , and on @xmath2 ( in particular , a _ divergence _ in the @xmath16 limit ) . as a result , although @xmath1 is bound to vanish for @xmath16 by the third law of thermodynamics , @xmath14 may in principle approach a finite value in this limit .    motivated by the above general observations , in the present paper we develop a theory for the transverse thermoelectric coefficients and their relation to diamagnetism in the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) superconducting device depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which the geometry dictates an appreciable nernst effect in the fluctuations - dominated regime .",
    "the device considered is a two - leg josephson ladder subject to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 , where a small temperature difference between the legs induces voltage along the ladder due to transport of vortices across the junction @xcite . at low @xmath2 ,",
    "one expects vortex transport to be dominated by quantum tunneling .",
    "this system serves as a minimal setup for observing transverse thermoelectric effects @xcite .",
    "the relative simplicity of the model describing the quantum dynamics of sc fluctuations allows an explicit evaluation of @xmath1 , @xmath14 and the magnetization density @xmath4 in a wide range of parameters .",
    "in particular , we investigate their behavior when the wires parameters are tuned through a sit , and find a prominent peak in @xmath14 close to the transition , which becomes progressively enhanced @xcite at low @xmath2 .",
    "we further confirm the proportionality relation between @xmath1 and @xmath17 , however the prefactor is @xmath18 , with @xmath5 the plasma energy scale , rather than @xmath19 as found in the 2d case @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we set up the model . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarize our main results and conclusions .",

    "[ fig1 ] , which consists of two sc wires of length @xmath20 parallel to the @xmath21 direction separated by a thin insulating layer of width @xmath22 , which allows a weak josephson coupling @xmath23 per unit length . in each of the separate wires ( @xmath24 ) , the 1d quantum dynamics of fluctuations in the phase of the sc condensate is governed by a hamiltonian of the form ( in units where @xmath25 ) @xmath26\\ ; ;    \\label{hn}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the collective phase field , and @xmath28 its conjugate field ( obeying @xmath29=i\\pi \\delta ( x^{\\prime } -x)$ ] ) which denotes cooper pair number fluctuations .",
    "this model can be viewed as describing , e.g. , the continuum limit of a josephson chain @xcite , where the josephson coupling ( @xmath30 ) and charging energy ( @xmath31 ) between adjacent sc grains are related to the parameters of @xmath32 by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the grain size .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ hn ] is a low - energy approximation of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "as will be shown later , to get non - trivial transverse thermoelectric effects we will need to keep corrections to @xmath32 involving , e.g. , higher derivatives of the fields .",
    "such corrections take into account , for example , fluctuations in the current density within the finite width of the wires ( @xmath36 ) , and coupling of the collective modes to microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the josephson coupling between the wires is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the deviation of the vortex density in the junction area from a commensurate value : @xmath39 in which ( for @xmath40 ) @xmath41 is the flux quantum . assuming the hierarchy of scales @xmath42 ( with @xmath2 an average temperature of the system ) , @xmath43 [ eq .",

    "additional perturbations such as inter - wire charging energy @xcite and disorder @xcite generate a transition to an insulating @xmath16 phase for sufficiently large @xmath44 .",
    "since , as shown below , in both extreme phases the nernst effect is strongly suppressed , we focus our attention on the _ intermediate _",
    "@xmath2 regime , where temperature exceeds the energy scale associated with all these perturbations .",
    "in addition to @xmath43 , we introduce a weak backscattering term due to disorder of the form @xmath46 where overline denotes disorder averaging .",

    "a current is induced along the legs of the ladder . alternatively , if one maintains open boundary conditions , a voltage develops along the wires due to the nernst effect .",

    "to summarize , we studied the transverse thermoelectric coefficients due to quantum sc fluctuations in a josephson two  leg ladder , and their relation to diamagnetism .",
    "most importantly , we predict a large nernst signal , particularly at moderately low temperatures ( @xmath121 ) where a pronounced peak is predicted close to the sit . this behavior reflects a subtle interplay between diamagnetism ( favored in the sc phase ) , and dynamical phase - fluctuations ( which proliferate in the insulator ) .    a crucial step in the derivation of the leading contribution to the transverse peltier coefficient @xmath1 relies on a correction to the hamiltonian which violates lorentz invariance of the model for quantum phase fluctuations in the sc wires .",
    "such terms are indeed necessary to couple the charge current to the thermal current : the correlation between them is at the heart of the peltier effect .",
    "this point can be understood also from a different angle , implementing the language of vortex physics : it is in fact possible to view @xmath1 as a dual of the ordinary ( longitudinal ) thermopower @xmath122 , which is known to encode the specific heat ( or entropy ) of charge carriers . in a dual representation",
    ", electric current in the transverse direction plays the role of a  voltage \" applying a _ longitudinal _ ( magnus ) force on the vortices , which balances the force imposed by the temperature gradient.the latter is proportional to the entropy of the vortices .",
    "hence , @xmath1 vanishes in the case where vortices carry no entropy ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we finally note that the remarkably simple relation to the entropy per carrier @xmath123 , derived for clean ( galilean invariant ) systems @xcite , does not hold here .",
    "indeed , this relation can be recovered , e.g. , employing the boltzmann equation for an ordinary conductor in the limit @xmath124 ( with @xmath125 the cyclotron frequency and @xmath126 a mean free time @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath127 the same calculation yields @xmath128 . in our case ,",
    "the latter limit is appropriate : while translational invariance holds in the @xmath21-direction , charge conductance along the @xmath129-direction is governed by weak tunneling between two discrete points , @xmath130 .",
    "we hence expect @xmath131 , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ alpha_xy_general ] ) .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we note that a qualitatively similar behavior of the nernst effect is expected to hold in 2d sc films , or an infinite stack of such ladders ( which is essentially equivalent to an anisotropic ultrathin sc film ) .",
    "possibly , it can also explain some properties of the existing data : see , for example , fig . 3 in the paper by pourret _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the nernst signal measured in nbsi films exhibits an increase ( and sharpening ) of the peak for @xmath132 .",
