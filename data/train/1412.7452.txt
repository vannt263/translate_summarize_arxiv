    "an energetic particle entering a solid metal will initiate a collision cascade upon scattering with an atomic nucleus , and this process often induces complex shockwaves .",
    "recent experimental observations suggest that small dislocation loops may be formed within individual displacement cascades during in - situ tem with 150-kev self - ion irradiation of w @xcite , which stimulates fundamental questions on how the formation of these extended defects and other defect distributions are related to the underlying cascade morphology .",

    "neglecting electronic losses amounts to an energy shift which is related to the difference between the true pka energy and the md cascade energy ; the latter of which is essentially equivalent to the damage energy in the norgett - robinson - torrens ( nrt ) displacement model @xcite .",

    "the deviation arises from the fact that the efficiency of in - cascade sia - vacancy recombination is energy dependent . in the low - energy regime ( @xmath28 ) , in - cascade recombination increases with energy .",
