    "modern cosmology witnessed a revolution in 1980 with the advent of cosmological inflation @xcite .",
    "the paradigm has stood the test of theoretical and observational challenges in the past two decades @xcite . in spite of its cosmological successes to solve horizon and flatness problems",
    ", it still remains a paradigm in search of a viable theoretical model .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that efforts are underway to derive inflationary models from string theory , a consistent quantum field theory around the planck s scale .",
    "the discovery of nonperturbative solutions , in string theory , called d - branes @xcite has given rise to new hopes in this direction .",
    "the d - brane cosmology is a subject of intense study at present .",
    "it ranges from inflation on a non - bps brane because of tachyon condensation to inflation due to the motion of a d3-brane towards an anti - d3-brane @xcite .",
    "efforts also have been made to study inflation due to geometric tachyon arising from the motion of a probe brane in the background of a stack of either ns5-branes or the dual d5-branes @xcite .",
    "these models are constructed in the framework of effective field theory and assume an underlying mechanism for the stabilization of various moduli fields .",
    "an important step towards a realistic inflationary model in string theory emerged from the realization that background fluxes can stabilize most of the modulus fields .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fluxes in a warped compactification , using a klebanov - strassler ( ks ) throat @xcite , can stabilize the dilaton and complex structure moduli of type iib string theory compactified on an orientifold of a calabi - yau threefold .",
    "in fact it was demonstrated in ref .  @xcite that all the closed string moduli can be stabilized by a combination of fluxes and nonperturbative effects .",
    "the nonperturbative effects are mainly responsible for stabilizing the khler moduli ; they arise , via gauge dynamics of either an euclidean d3-brane or from a stack of @xmath5 d7-branes wrapping super - symmetrically a four cycle in the warped throat .",
    "the warped volume of the four cycle controls the magnitude of the nonperturbative effect since it affects the gauge coupling on the d7-branes wrapping this four cycle .",
    "the above formalism could lead to the construction of a realistic inflationary model @xcite , in string theory , which is built upon the compactification data ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the inflaton potential can be obtained by performing string theoretic computations involving the details of the compactification scheme . in this setup inflation",
    "is realized by the motion of a d3-brane towards a distant static anti - d3-brane , placed at the tip of the throat .",
    "the position of the moving brane in the compactification manifold is identified with the inflaton field . to be more precise ,",
    "the location of the mobile brane can be labeled with five angular coordinates and one radial coordinate , @xmath6 .",
    "the canonical inflaton field @xmath1 is expressed by a constant re - scaling of this radial coordinate .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the embedding of the d7-branes as given in @xcite was considered .",
    "it was assumed that at least one of the four - cycles carrying the nonperturbative effects descend down a finite distance into the warped throat .",
    "it was then shown that the presence of a d3-brane gives rise to a perturbation to the warp factor affecting a correction to the warped four cycle volume .",
    "moreover , this correction depends on the position of the d3-brane and thus the superpotential for the nonperturbative effect gets corrected by an overall position - dependent factor . the total potential , that the mobile d3-brane experiences , is the sum of the potential ( f - term ) coming from the superpotential and the usual d - term potential contributed by the interaction between the d3-brane and the anti - d3-brane .",
    "when the corrections to the nonperturbative superpotential is taken into account , the issue of volume modulus stabilization needs to be re - analyzed .",
    "this has been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite and the viability of inflation was investigated in this modified scenario .    the model in ref .",
    "@xcite is described by a two - field potential @xmath7 in terms of the inflaton @xmath1 and the volume modulus @xmath8 .",
    "if the mass of the modulus is much larger than the hubble rate , the field @xmath8 approximately evolves along the instantaneous minima determined by the condition @xmath9 .",
    "one can obtain an effective single - field potential with respect to @xmath1 by integrating out @xmath8 in this way .",
    "however , we need to be careful for the fact that the actual trajectory is determined by the direction along the velocity of the fields .",
    "we shall introduce a new rotated field @xmath3 along the background trajectory and show that the usual single - field description holds for @xmath3 and not for @xmath1 . as a result the single - field description in terms of @xmath1 underestimates the total amount of e - foldings even by one order of magnitude .",
    "this reflects that fact that the amount of inflation is sensitive to the slight change of the potential and also of model parameters .",
    "we shall also calculate the spectra of density perturbations generated in this model .",
    "again the spectral index @xmath10 is determined by the slow - roll parameter @xmath4 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "thus we show that the correct single - field description in terms of @xmath3 is crucially important to study the perturbation spectra as well as the background dynamics .",
    "in this section we review the derivation of the scalar potential @xcite on a mobile d3-brane .",
    "the fluxes for the compactification of type iib string theory on an orientifold of calabi - yau theory are chosen such that the internal space has a warped throat region .",
    "for example , the local geometry is taken to be the warped deformed conifold which is a subspace of complex dimension three in a four dimensional complex space defined by the constraint @xmath12 where @xmath13 are coordinates in the four dimensional complex space and @xmath14 is real and corresponds to the deformation parameter . when the region of relevance for the d - brane inflation is chosen to lie far from the tip of the throat",
    ", the deformed parameter can be neglected .",
    "we can then choose @xmath15 as the three independent complex coordinates for the position of the d3-brane ( open string moduli ) and use the conifold constraint to express @xmath16 in terms of these three coordinates .",
    "the throat can be glued into a compact space , which is assumed to have a single khler modulus @xmath17 .",
    "one can take the khler potential to be [ kapot ] k= ( _ i=1 ^ 4    @xmath18 , is ricci - flat .",
    "thus the metric of the deformed conifold can be written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the metric on the einstein space @xmath21 , which can be expressed in terms of five angular coordinates .",
    "these angular coordinates and the real radial coordinate @xmath6 are the basis for the complex coordinates @xmath13 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the @xmath22 supergravity f - term scalar potential involving the dewolfe - giddings khler potential @xmath23 and the super potential @xmath24 is given by [ knew ] v_f = e^^2 k , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "these d7-branes wrap a four - cycle in the warped throat preserving supersymmetry which is specified by the embedding equation @xmath40 .",
    "the presence of the d3-brane also leads to a perturbation to the warp factor which results in a correction to the warped four - cycle volume .",
    "this correction has been found to be d3-brane position dependent and , in fact , is responsible for the pre - factor @xmath41 in @xmath42 @xcite . in ref .",

    "the potential , @xmath44 , thus is a complicated function of the khler modulus , the radial and the five angular coordinates of the mobile d3-brane .",

    "similarly , the five angular coordinates , which describe the position of the d3-brane on the base of the throat , are periodic coordinates on a compact space .",
    "thus , the potential in these fields is either constant or has discrete minima for some fixed values of these five fields .",
