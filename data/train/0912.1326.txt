    "x - ray observations of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars provide an important means of determining physical conditions in their powerful metal - rich winds and in hot wind - blown bubbles which can surround the star .",
    "x - ray observations yield information on the temperature , emission measure , and luminosity of hot plasma that can be used to test models of wr x - ray emission , which are largely based on the idea that the x - rays arise in shocked winds .",
    "photoelectric absorption of low - energy x - rays can reveal the presence of gas along the line - of - sight toward the star that is difficult to detect by other means .",
    "high - resolution grating spectra can be obtained for the brightest wr x - ray sources and are capable of constraining the location of the x - ray emittng plasma relative to the star , wind parameters , and wind element abundances .",
    "it has been nearly three decades since wr stars were discovered to be x - ray sources by the _ einstein observatory _",
    "( seward et al . 1979 ) .",
    "however , the origin of the x - ray emission is still not totally understood and more than one process may be involved . in the case of single wr stars ( and single ob stars ) , most theoretical work has focused on x - ray production in shocks that are formed in the wind via line - driven instabilities ( lucy & white 1980 ; lucy 1982 ; owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ; baum et al . 1992 ; feldmeier et al . 1997 ; gayley & owocki 1995 ) .",
    "such x - ray emission is expected to be soft ( kt @xmath4 1 kev ) and x - ray emission lines lines in optically thick winds are predicted to be asymmetric with blueshifted centroids ( owocki & cohen 2001 ) .",
    "alternate models which attribute shock production to plasmoids moving through the wind have also recently been proposed ( waldron & cassinelli 2009 ) .",
    "the emission of wr binaries is potentially more complex than single stars since it may consist of intrinsic stellar wind - shock emission plus x - rays from a colliding wind shock between the two stars ( prilutskii & usov 1976 ; luo et al .",
    "1990 ; stevens , blondin , & pollock 1992 ; usov 1992 ) .",
    "the maximum x - ray temperature of an adiabatic colliding wind shock is proportional to the square of the wind speed perpendicular to the shock front ( luo et al .",
    "values kt@xmath5 @xmath6 2 kev are expected for typical wr wind speeds of v@xmath7 @xmath8 1000 - 5000 km s@xmath9 .",
    "attempts to confirm x - ray wind - shock models observationally have yielded mixed results .",
    "some evidence supporting the colliding wind picture in massive binaries has been obtained from _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ grating observations of x - ray bright systems such as @xmath10 vel ( wc8 @xmath11 o7.5 ; skinner et al .",
    "2001 ; schild et al .",
    "2004 ) and wr 140 ( wc7 @xmath11 o4 - 5 ; pollock et al . 2005 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiative wind shock picture for single massive stars has not yet found broad observational support .",
    "perhaps the best evidence for x - ray production in radiative wind shocks has come from grating observations of the o4f supergiant @xmath12 pup , which reveal wind - broadened emission lines ( hwhm @xmath13 600 - 1600 km s@xmath9 ) with blueshifted centroids ( cassinelli et al .",
    "2001 ) and a substantial emission measure contribution from low - temperature plasma ( kahn et al .",
    "however , grating spectra of other ob stars show narrower unshifted symmetric emission lines that are more difficult to reconcile with radiative wind shock predictions ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2002 ; schulz et al .",
    "2000 ; cohen et al .",
    "2008 ; skinner et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "compelling evidence for x - rays from radiative wind shocks in single wr stars is currently lacking .",
    "but , very few sensitive pointed observations of single wr stars exist and there are no single wr stars yet known that are bright enough in x - rays to acquire good - quality grating spectra in reasonable exposure times .",
    "even so , ccd observations without gratings are feasible and moderate resolution ccd spectra capable of distinguishing between cool plasma that could arise in radiative wind shocks and hotter plasma due to other processes such as colliding winds can be readily obtained .",
    "we have thus initiated an x - ray survey of single wr stars with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ aimed at broadening the observational data base and determining their basic properties such as x - ray temperature and luminosity .",
    "our initial targets included both nitrogen - rich wn stars and carbon - rich wc stars .",
    "they were selected from the viith catalog of galactic wolf - rayet stars ( van der hucht 2001 , herafter vdh01 ) , giving preference to objects lying closest to the sun with low a@xmath2 and no evidence for binarity .",
    "so far , we have observed four apparently single carbon - type wc stars and , surprisingly , none was detected ( skinner et al .",
    "2006 ; 2009 ) .",
    "these are wr 5 ( wc6 ) , wr 57 ( wc8 ) , wr 90 ( wc7 ) , and wr 135 ( wc8 ) .",

    "observation of wr 135 for which we obtained log l@xmath14(0.5 - 7 kev ) @xmath15 29.82 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "this is @xmath132 - 3 orders of magnitude below typical x - ray emission levels of wr binaries and x - ray detected wn stars that are not known to be binaries .",
    "a non - detection of the wc5 star wr 114 was also reported by oskinova et al .",
    "sensitive observations of a broader sample of single wc stars are still needed , but the lack of detections in these exploratory observations already suggests they are either intrinsically faint x - ray emitters , or perhaps x - ray quiet .",
    "in contrast , high - confidence x - ray detections have been obtained for some apparently single wn stars ( skinner et al .",
    "2002a , b ; ignace et al . 2003a",
    "; oskinova 2005 ; naz et al .",
    "these detections are confined primarily to spectral subtypes of wn6 and earlier .",
    "very little is yet known about the x - ray properties of wn7 - 9 stars .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of subtypes wn6 and earlier span a wide range log l@xmath14 @xmath8 31 - 33 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "it is remarkable that wn6 stars themselves have l@xmath14 values spanning nearly two orders of magnitude . in those cases where good x - ray spectra of early wn subtypes ( @xmath15wn6 ) exist ,",

    "the cool plasma is compatible with radiative wind shock predictions but the hot plasma is not .",
    "the existence of x - ray emission in late wn7 - 9 stars has not been thoroughly investigated .",
    "but , there are indications that their x - ray luminosity levels are low . an _ xmm - newton _ observation of wr 40 ( wn8 ; gosset et al . 2005 ) yielded a non - detection with a conservative upper limit log l@xmath14 @xmath15 31.6 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "but , an archival _ rosat _ pspc image ( rp200150n00 ) reveals a marginal detection of the wn9 star wr 79a at a 12.2@xmath18 off - axis position , which was our primary motivation for reobserving it at higher sensitivity with _ xmm - newton_.    we report here on sensitive x - ray observations of four wn stars of spectral subtypes wn2 - wn9 , namely wr 2 ( wn2 ) , wr 18 ( wn 4 ) , wr 134 ( wn6 ) , and wr 79 ( wn9 ha ) .",

    "table 3 summarizes the x - ray properties of the four newly - detected wn stars and three wn stars from the _ chandra _ archive ( wr 20b , wr 24 , and wr 136 ) .",
    "there is very good agreement between the x - ray positions and the optical positions of the wn stars given in the _ hst _ guide star catalog ( gsc ) .",
    "radial offsets between the x - ray and optical positions are @xmath150.3@xmath19 for the new detections , being within the 1@xmath23 range of _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ positional accuracy .",
    "similar offsets were obtained for the archive detections .",
    "there is thus no reason to doubt that the x - ray sources are the optically - identified wr stars .",
    "no significant x - ray variability was detected in any of the targets , but sampling in the time domain spans less than @xmath1310 hours for the four new detections and @xmath41 day for the archive sources .",
    "thus , variability on longer timescales exceeding one day can not yet be ruled out .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the four new detections are shown in figure 5 and the archive spectra in figure 6 .",
    "all spectra show some absorption below @xmath130.8 kev as well as prominent emission lines or line complexes indicative of thermal emission .",
    "the most prominent lines are the unresolved mg xi he - like triplet at 1.33 - 1.35 kev ( maximum line power temperature log t@xmath5 = 6.8 k ) and the unresolved si xiii triplet at 1.84 - 1.86 kev ( log t@xmath5 = 7.0 k ) .",
    "the higher temperature s xv line at 2.46 kev ( log t@xmath5 = 7.2 k ) is also seen in all stars , but is very faint in wr 2 . the high - temperature line from he - like ar xvii ( log t@xmath5 = 7.3 k ) ,",
    "is detected in several stars and is quite strong in wr 20b .",
    "faint emission near 3.9 kev in the wn6h stars wr 20b and wr 136 may be due to he - like ca xix ( log t@xmath5 = 7.5 k ) but we classify this line only as a possible detection . the fe k@xmath26 complex ( fe xxv ; 6.67 kev log t@xmath5 = 7.6 k )",
    "is detected in wr 20b , wr 134 , and wr 136 .",
    "this line is a signature of very hot plasma , which is undoubtedly present in these latter three wn6h stars .",
    "we have attempted to fit the spectra with various emission models , including the xspec variable - abundance optically thin plasma model @xmath27 ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) and the constant temperature plane - parallel shock model @xmath28 ( borkowski et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "all models included a photoelectric absorption component ( xspec model @xmath29 ) which was used to determine the equivalent neutral h column density n@xmath30 .",
    "element abundances are expected to deviate strongly from solar composition in wn stars as the result of advanced nucleosynthesis .",
    "h is depleted along with c and o , while he and n are enriched ( van der hucht et al .",
    "1986 ; hereafter vcw86 ) .",
    "because of the moderate ccd spectral resolution of acis - s and epic and limited total source counts , we are not able to place tight constraints on element abundances using the x - ray spectra . we have thus adopted the generic wn abundances of vcw86 ( table 4 ) as starting values in spectral fits using the @xmath27 and @xmath28 models .",
    "selected elements were allowed to deviate from the vcw86 values to improve the fits , as detailed in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "the total x - ray absorption likely includes constributions from solar abundance material in the interstellar medium and stellar wind absorption from material enriched with heavy elements .",
    "the ccd spectra do not provide sufficient information to disentangle solar and nonsolar absorption , and we have thus modeled x - ray absorption using solar abundances ( xspec @xmath29 ; anders & ebihara 1982 ) .",
    "our main spectral analysis results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) single - temperature optically - thin plasma models ( 1 t @xmath27 ) do not provide acceptable fits , even if abundances are allowed to vary , ( ii ) two - temperature models ( 2 t @xmath27 ) are acceptable but the goodness - of - fit statistic ( @xmath31 ) is sensitive to abundances ; ( iii ) all stars show both a cool ( kt@xmath16 @xmath0 1 kev ) and hot ( kt @xmath1 2 kev ) plasma component , ( iv ) most stars show x - ray absorption in excess of that expected from their optical extinction a@xmath2 , ( v ) fits using isothermal plane - parallel shock models are not as good as 2 t @xmath27 ( wr 20b excepted ) .      in all cases , the 2 t model requires a cool component at kt@xmath16 @xmath13 0.3 - 0.6 kev plus a hotter component at kt@xmath17 @xmath1 2 kev .",
    "the best - fit value of kt@xmath17 for wr 2 is sensitive to the s abundance , which is not well - constrained by the data .",
    "we thus quote only a lower 90% confidence bound on kt@xmath17 for wr 2 .",
    "the respective normalization values ( @xmath32 ) for each component show that most of the emission measure in wr 2 , wr 18 , and wr 79a is associated with the cooler component , while the hotter component clearly dominates in wr 134 and wr 136 .",
    "the best - fit neutral - h absorption column density ( n@xmath30 ) is a factor of @xmath132 - 4 lower in wr 2 than in the other three stars . using the conversion n@xmath30 @xmath33 2.22 @xmath21 10@xmath34 a@xmath35 @xmath36 ( gorenstein 1975 )",
    ", it is apparent from table 4 that the x - ray derived n@xmath30 is consistent with that expected from a@xmath35 = 1.58 mag for wr 2 ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , the n@xmath30 for wr 18 , wr79a , and wr 134 is a factor of @xmath82 - 4 greater than anticipated from a@xmath35 , implying the presence of x - ray absorbing gas ( e.g. the wind ) that does not contribute significantly to the optical extinction .",
    "excess absorption is also present in the archive detection wr 20b .",
    "some improvement in the 2 t @xmath27 fits was obtained by allowing elements with detectable line emission ( n , ne , mg , si , s , fe ) to deviate from the generic wn values ( table 4 and 5 notes ) .",
    "in particular , our fits of several stars were improved by using s abundances larger than the value given in vcw86 ( which was based on cosmic mass fraction ) .",
    "given the expectation that wr star x - ray emission may arise in shocked winds , we attempted to fit the spectra of all detections except wr 18 with @xmath28 in order to determine if a simplistic constant - temperature shock model could reproduce the spectra .",
    "there are insufficient counts in wr 18 to establish a clear preference between thin plasma models and shock models .",
    "the @xmath28 fits used data from the atomic plasma emission database ( aped ) to calculate the spectrum ( xspec option @xmath37 2.0 ) .    for the new detections ,",
    "reasonably good @xmath28 fits were obtained for both wr 2 and wr 134 , but we do not find a clear preference for @xmath28 over the 2 t @xmath27 model in either case . for wr 2 ,",
    "@xmath28 gives shock temperatures in the range kt@xmath38 @xmath13 1.5 - 3.5 kev , but in order to obtain acceptable fits the abundances of elements with line emission above 2 kev ( most notably s and ar ) must be increased to very high values .",
    "when abundances are fixed at the generic wn values , @xmath28 underestimates the hard flux above 2 kev .",
    "when abundances are allowed to vary , the model attempts to correct for this flux deficit by running up the s and ar abundances while at the same time keeping kt@xmath38 @xmath13 2 kev .",
    "this is likely a consequence of attempting to fit a multi - temperature plasma with an overly simplistic constant - temperature shock model . for wr 134 , high shock temperatures kt@xmath38 @xmath39 10 kev",
    "are required and even with such high temperatures the @xmath31 fit statistic is not as good as obtained with 2 t @xmath40 .    for the archive detections , the @xmath28 fits for wr 24 and wr 136 are reasonably good above 1 kev but the shock model underestimates the observed flux of the softer emission below @xmath131 kev .",
    "wr 20b provides an interesting exception because the @xmath28 model actually provides a better fit to its spectrum than 2 t @xmath27 ( table 5 notes ) .",
    "the inferred shock temperature kt@xmath38 = 3.9 kev is quite high .",
    "however , the soft emission below 1 kev that can not be accurately reproduced with @xmath28 in the other stars is not detected in wr 20b ( fig .",
    "thus , the good results obtained with @xmath28 for wr 20b may simply be a consequence of its higher absorption .      * wr 2 ( wn2 ) * :   wr 2 is a new _ chandra _ detection and is the earliest wn subtype in our sample .",

    "it may not be a coincidence that wr 2 has little or no excess absorption given that it has the highest effective temperature of the four newly - detected stars ( t@xmath47 = 141 kk , hamann et al .",

    "of the four stars observed , wr 2 shows the coolest emission . assuming its cool plasma originates in wind shocks , we equate the best - fit temperature of the cool component with the shock temperature , that is kt@xmath16 = 0.32 [ 0.24 - 0.45 ] kev = kt@xmath51 . for an adiabatic shock the maximum shock temperature is kt@xmath51 = ( 3/16)mv@xmath52 , where v@xmath51 is the shock velocity perpendicular to the shock front ( luo et al .",

    "the slightly higher values kt@xmath16 @xmath13 0.6 kev for the other three stars give shock speeds v@xmath51 @xmath13 480 km s@xmath9 .",

    "so there is sufficient wind kinetic energy to power the soft x - ray emission even at a rather low conversion efficiency from kinetic to radiative energy .",
    "but , numerical models show that forward shocks decay with radius ( feldmeier et al .",

    "we now consider another star , wr 20b , which is an interesting case because of the good fit obtained with an isothermal plane - parallel shock model .",
    "the best - fit shock temperature kt@xmath51 = 3.86 [ 2.97 - 6.53 ] kev is too high to explain by radiative wind shocks , but is plausible for colliding wind shocks .",
    "if the wind of wr 20b is shocking onto an unseen companion , then the inferred shock velocity perpendicular to the interface is v@xmath51 = 1216 [ 1067 - 1582 ] km s@xmath9 .",

    "but , if magnetic fields of sufficient strength exist then they could confine the ionized wind into two oppositely directed streams which collide near the magnetic equator and form a magnetically - confined wind shock ( mcws ) .",
    "this mechanism is of interest because it is capable of producing hot x - ray plasma over a range of temperatures up to several kev ( babel & montmerle 1997 ) and could potentially explain the hotter plasma seen in the wn star spectra .",
    "a rough estimate of the field strength needed to confine the wind can be obtained using the confinement parameter @xmath58 = b@xmath59r@xmath60/@xmath48v@xmath7 where b@xmath61 is the field strength at the magnetic equator ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) . for @xmath58 @xmath13 1",
    "the wind is marginally - confined by the b - field , for @xmath58 @xmath62 1 the wind overpowers the field and is not confined , and for @xmath58 @xmath63 1 the wind is strongly - confined .",

    "these fields are for marginal confinement and larger fields would be needed for strong confinement . without concrete evidence for strong b fields in wr stars ,",

    "our four new detections and archive sources were selected on the basis that they are so far not known to be close ( spectroscopic ) binary systems .",
    "thus , any attempt to explain their x - ray emission by invoking an unseen companion is not strongly motivated on observational grounds .",

    "wr 134 has been regarded as a possible close binary system because of its known 2.25 day periodic line profile changes .",
    "this issue has been previously discussed by morel et al .",

    "could potentially explain the hard x - ray emission in wr 134 .",
    "hard x - rays could be produced by the wr wind accreting onto a compact object or by the wind shocking onto the surface of a normal ( nondegenerate ) stellar companion .",

    "the possibility of a low - mass companion was previously considered in our analysis of the similar wn - type star wr 6 ( skinner et al .",

    "the sample of single wn stars for which x - ray parameters have been reliably determined from good - quality ccd spectra is not yet large enough to establish any clear correlations between stellar and x - ray properties .",
    "other factors such as uncertain distances , bolometric luminosities , and mass - loss parameters hinder correlation studies and can mask dependencies",
    ".    however , x - ray observations now span the full range of spectral subtypes from wn2 to wn9 and a few notable trends are beginning to emerge .",
    "as figure 8 shows , there is an apparent falloff in l@xmath14 toward later wn7 - 9 subtypes .",
    "the wn9 ha star wr 79a has the lowest l@xmath14 of any detected single wn star so far . and , the wn8h star wr 40 was undetected in a previous _ xmm - newton _ observation at an upper limit log l@xmath14 @xmath0 31.6 ergs s@xmath9 ( gosset et al . 2005 ) .",

    "the apparent decrease in l@xmath14 for wn7 - 9 subtypes is surprising because it is in the opposite sense of l@xmath3 , which is larger for wn7 - 9 stars than wn2 - 6 stars ( table 1 ; hamann et al .",

    "we plot l@xmath14 versus l@xmath3 in figure 9 .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates that even though the wn and wc stars observed to date have similar l@xmath3 , the wc stars ( all undetected ) are at least 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less luminous in x - rays . considering only the detected wn stars , one might be tempted to argue for a weak increase in l@xmath14 with l@xmath3 .",
    "but , the absence of x - ray detections for three wnl stars with high l@xmath3 ( wr 16 , 40 , 78 ) is clearly at odds with this picture .",

    "thus , some other stellar parameters besides l@xmath3 are critical for determining x - ray luminosity levels in these wn stars , and wind properties may play a key role .",

    "1999 ) .",
    "thus , there is no doubt that _ some _ wr binaries are x - ray luminous .",
    "but , are _ all _ wr binaries x - ray luminous",
    "? we do not yet know the answer to that question because it can be very difficult to distinguish a closely - spaced binary from a single wr star .",
    "it is very likely that some wr stars currently classified as single objects are in fact close unresolved binaries .",
    "also , a high x - ray luminosity is not strictly required in a colliding wind wr binary system . for an adiabatic colliding wind system",
    "the luminosity scales roughly as l@xmath14 @xmath71 @xmath77@xmath78d@xmath9 where @xmath48 and @xmath79 are the mass - loss rate and wind - speed of the dominant component and d is the binary separation ( luo et al .",
    "1990 ; stevens et al . 1992 ) .",
    "binaries with lower mass - loss rates or wide separations are expected to have lower l@xmath14 , all other factors being equal .",
    "based on the above , which wn stars in our sample are good binary candidates ?",
    "wr 24 would appear to be a very good candidate because of absorption lines in its optical spectrum ( vdh01 ) and its high l@xmath14 and l@xmath3 .",
    "in fact , its position in the ( l@xmath3,l@xmath14 ) diagram is almost identical to that of the known binary wr 147 ( fig .",
    "wr 20b is also a good candidate because of its exceptionally high x - ray luminosity , even when computed using the lowest current distance estimate of d = 2.37 kpc .",
    "searches for close companions in these two stars are certainly justified .",
    "apart from wr 20b and wr 24 , there are no other stars in our sample having high log l@xmath14 @xmath6 33.0 ergs s@xmath9 that could signal binarity . a particularly interesting case is wr 79a ( wn9 ha ) .",
    "this star would seem to be a good candidate for binarity based on absorption lines in its spectrum and the possible presence of nonthermal radio emission ( cappa et al .",
    "but its x - ray luminosity log l@xmath14 = 32.14 ergs s@xmath9 is at the low end of the detected wn stars .",
    "if wr 79a is indeed a binary then its l@xmath14 is much less than other known wn binaries , or its distance has been underestimated .",
    "wr 134 is another intriguing example . based on its known 2.25 day spectroscopic variability",
    "it would seem to rank as a strong binary candidate . as noted in section 4.4 ,",
    "the high temperature of its hot x - ray component is indeed consistent with that expected if the wind of wr 134 were shocking onto a companion at terminal speed .",
    "but there are questions as to whether the x - rays could escape if produced in a closely - spaced colliding wind binary system , and the x - ray luminosity of wr 134 ( log l@xmath14 = 32.66 ergs s@xmath9 ) is not as high as other known wn binaries .",
    "thus , the existing x - ray data for wr 134 do not provide an indisputable case for binarity . further observations of wr 134 aimed at determining whether its x - ray emission is modulated at the 2.25 day optical period would be useful since colliding wind binaries such as @xmath10 velorum and wr 140 do show orbital x - ray modulation ( willis , schild , & stevens 1995 ; zhekov & skinner 2000 ; pollock et al . 2005 ) .",
    "our pilot survey has so far detected all four wn stars observed .",
    "in contrast , x - ray observations at similar sensitivity levels did not detect any of the four wc stars in our sample , and a fifth went undetected in another _ xmm - newton _ program ( sec . 1 ) .",
    "why is it that most wn stars are detected as x - ray sources , but wc stars are not ?",
    "an important clue to solving this puzzle may lie in the excess x - ray absorption seen in the spectra of most of the wn stars ( sec .",
    "such excess absorption has been seen in other wn stars such as wr 6 ( wn4 ; skinner et al .",
    "the wind is likely responsible for most of this excess .",
    "x - rays produced within the wind must overcome the wind opacity to escape , and the opacity increases toward lower photon energies , all other factors being equal .",
    "thus , softer x - ray photons will be more heavily absorbed and the softest photons detected will have emerged from the wind at large distances from the star .",
    "the wind opacity in wc stars is much higher than in wn stars due to metal - enrichment . for a given set of mass - loss parameters ,",
    "x - rays of a given energy will have more difficulty escaping a wc wind than a wn wind . as a specific example",
    ", we consider a generic wr star with a typical mass - loss rate of @xmath48 = 2 @xmath21 10@xmath22 m@xmath50 yr@xmath9 and v@xmath7 = 1800 km s@xmath9 .",
    "adopting canonical wn and wc abundances ( vcw86 ) and bm92 cross - sections , the radius of optical depth unity for an x - ray photon of energy e = 1 kev is @xmath813 times greater for a wc star than for a wn star . even at higher energies",
    "e = 3 kev the r@xmath49 ratio is still a factor of @xmath811 . thus ,",
    "unless x - rays of moderate energy e @xmath13 1 - 3 kev are formed very far out in the wind of a wc star ( at thousands of solar radii ) they will be absorbed .",
    "this is perhaps the most plausible explanation for the absence of wc star x - ray detections at present . but",
    "a larger sample of wc stars needs to be observed in order to determine if hard x - rays might escape through the wind in some cases .",
    "the best candidates for such observations would be wc stars with higher t@xmath80 and lower wind densities ( lower @xmath48 and higher v@xmath7 ) , which would conspire to reduce wind opacity .",
    "the most important results of this study are the following :    1 .",
    "x - ray emission has been detected from four recently - observed wn stars ranging in spectral type from wn2 - wn9 , none of which is so far known to be a binary system .",
    "archive data provide detections for an additional three wn6h stars .",
    "it is thus now established that both wne and wnl stars are x - ray sources .",
    "the spectra of all stars are similar .",
    "all show an admixture of cool ( kt@xmath16 @xmath0 1 kev ) and hot ( kt @xmath1 2 kev ) x - ray plasma and prominent emission lines from ions such as si xiii and s xv .",
    "x - ray luminosities are typically log l@xmath14 @xmath8 32.5 ergs s@xmath9 , but there is a rather large scatter of @xmath461 dex around this value . some of this scatter is likely due to uncertain distances for many wr stars .",
    "most of the detected wn stars show x - ray absorption in excess of that expected from published a@xmath2 estimates ( wr 2 being an exception ) .",
    "a plausible explanation for the excess absorption is that the x - rays are formed within the wind and are strongly absorbed by the wind at lower energies .",
    "the presence of high - temperature plasma in supposedly single wn stars is not predicted by radiative wind shock models .",
    "other mechanisms are thus required to explain the hotter plasma .",
    "close companion models are not clearly justified given the lack of evidence for binarity .",
    "magnetic wind confinement models provide some promise , but the presence of magnetic fields in wr stars has so far not been demonstrated .",
    "further theoretical work is needed to develop models that can account for such hot plasma .",
    "although the sample of wn stars observed in x - rays is small , there is a noticeable trend toward lower l@xmath14 in the later wn7 - 9 subtypes .",
    "this is in the opposite sense of l@xmath3 , which increases toward later wn7 - 9 subtypes .",
    "thus , other factors besides l@xmath3 determine x - ray luminosity in single wn stars .",
    "wind properties appear to be important , and sensitive x - ray observations of a broader sample of wn stars , particularly at low terminal wind speeds , are needed to determine if l@xmath14 depends on wind parameters .",

    "<S> we summarize new x - ray detections of four nitrogen - type wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars obtained in a limited survey aimed at establishing the x - ray properties of wn stars across their full range of spectral subtypes . </S>",
    "<S> none of the detected stars is so far known to be a close binary . </S>",
    "<S> we report _ chandra _ detections of wr 2 ( wn2 ) , wr 18 ( wn4 ) , and wr 134 ( wn6 ) , and an _ xmm - newton _ detection of wr79a ( wn9 ha ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations clearly demonstrate that both wne and wnl stars are x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss _ chandra _ archive detections of the wn6h stars wr 20b , wr 24 , and wr 136 and _ rosat _ non - detections of wr 16 ( wn8h ) and wr 78 ( wn7h ) . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of all wn detections show prominent emission lines and an admixture of cool ( kt @xmath0 1 kev ) and hot ( kt @xmath1 2 kev ) plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the hotter plasma is not predicted by radiative wind shock models and other as yet unidentified mechanisms are at work . </S>",
    "<S> most stars show x - ray absorption in excess of that expected from visual extinction ( a@xmath2 ) , likely due to their strong winds or cold circumstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> existing data suggest a falloff in x - ray luminosity toward later wn7 - 9 subtypes , which have higher l@xmath3 but slower , denser winds than wn2 - 6 stars . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a clue that wind properties may be a more crucial factor in determining emergent x - ray emission levels than bolometric luminosity . </S>"
