    "the @xmath0-process of nucleosynthesis is responsible for over half the elements with @xmath2 but to date no self - consistent model for an astrophysical site for the production of these elements has been identified .",
    "the two candidates most discussed in the literature are the neutrino driven wind of type ii supernovae @xcite and ejecta from neutron star mergers @xcite .",
    "the former site is attractive because it occurs on a timescale such that it could reasonably account for observations in metal poor halo stars e.g. @xcite and could produce roughly the right amount of material @xcite . furthermore , the neutrinos from the protoneutron star set the electron fraction to a relatively low value and this , combined with the high entropy , makes it a promising site . although attempts to produce the @xmath0-process elements this way initially succeeded , subsequent refining of the models indicated that the conditions were a near miss , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in addition , self - consistent inclusion of the neutrinos in a reaction network demonstrated that electron neutrino capture on neutrons during the course of alpha particle formation drove the electron fraction up to values unacceptable to the @xmath0-process @xcite .",
    "the other primary candidate for the production of @xmath0-process elements , the ejecta from neutron star mergers , is a viable candidate for producing some of these elements .",
    "however as a dominant @xmath0-process site , it would be difficult to reconcile with the observations from metal poor stars , e.g. @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 process has more than one component , as suggested by meteoritic evidence @xcite and observations of the low mass end of the @xmath0-process distribution , then neutron star mergers could well contribute .",
    "here we discuss another possible site for the @xmath0 process , which is in the winds from accretion disks in gamma ray bursts .",
    "gamma ray bursts represent an emerging new area in nucleosynthesis research .",
    "the leading candidate sites for these objects are rare supernovae , such as a collapsars @xcite , and for the short bursts , neutron star - neutron star mergers @xcite . in either case",
    ", the system likely forms an accretion disk surrounding a black hole .",
    "some nucleosynthesis will occur in the jet @xcite , some will occur as explosive burning @xcite and still more will occur in the outflow , perhaps a wind @xcite , from the accretion disk .",
    "the rate of gamma ray bursts is estimated to be quite low , @xmath3 per year in the galaxy , e. g. as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however since their origin is not yet fully understood , they may well represent one end of a continuum of objects .",

    "[ fig : neutsph],width=302 ]    the possibility of obtaining an @xmath0 process in an accretion disk wind is closely tied to understanding the neutrinos which are emitted copiously from the disk .",
    "neutrinos are involved in all charge - changing interactions @xmath6 @xmath7 both in the disk and in the outflow from the disk . in order to make the outflow neutron rich ,",
    "either electron capture or electron antineutrino capture must dominate . in the case of disks with high accretion rates where",

    "although the electron antineutrinos which come from the surface shown in [ fig : spectra]a have higher temperature than the neutrinos , the area of the antineutrino surface is very small , so the number of antineutrinos is not large and a significant number of those seen in [ fig : spectra]a are coming directly from inverse beta decay in the free streaming region . in the higher accretion rate disk ,",
    "the situation is quite different . because the antineutrino surface has grown , and the antineutrinos have higher temperature than the neutrinos , the antineutrino flux is larger and more energetic than the neutrino flux . in these models",
    "the electron neutrino temperature at the neutrino surface varies with position but is around @xmath14 to @xmath15 while the temperature at the antineutrino surface is around @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xcite . in even lower accretion rate disks ( not shown here ) , e.g. popham , woosley , fryer ( 1999 ) @xcite , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the neutrinos are barely trapped and the antineutrinos are not trapped at all .",
    "we study the effect of the charge - changing interactions on the outflow from the disk by using a parameterization for the wind , as in @xcite .",
    "the velocity is taken to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 for the first , vertical part of the trajectory and the starting position of the material is @xmath22 .",

    "[ fig : yevsr ] , we show outflow from two different types of disk models , dpn @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    it can be seen from these figures that the neutrinos influence the electron fraction in opposite directions in the two models . in the more moderate accretion rate model @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath4 , the large flux of neutrinos shown in fig [ fig : spectra ] raises the electron fraction to quite high values .",
    "however in the higher accretion rate model , @xmath13 , @xmath4 , the large flux of antineutrinos decreases the electron fraction to quite low values , even in the case of a high entropy outflow . also interesting is the low entropy case in fig .",
    "[ fig : yevsr]b , where the electron fraction remains quite low regardless of the influence of the neutrinos .",
    "this is due to the electron degeneracy of the material at a high density and low entropy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : outflow ] , we survey a number of different outflows , by plotting the electron fraction measured at a little under an mev against entropy for several different values of @xmath25 . in all cases",

    "[ fig : outflow],width=302 ]    the plus signs show the effect of a slow outflow parameter @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino capture rates completely overwhelm the electron and positron capture rates , and the system finds a weak equilibrium such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is antineutrino capture on protons and @xmath36 is neutrino capture on neutrons .    again we see that a slow outflow from a high accretion rate disk will produce a low electron fraction due to the neutrino interactions , although for any outflow a low entropy will also create a low electron fraction . for the lower accretion rate disk and slow outflows",
    ", the neutrinos always make the material more proton rich and in fact it is only the case of low entropy and minimal neutrino interactions that produces a low electron fraction .",
    "although there are two regions of parameter space which will produce very neutron rich winds , this is not a guarantee of a successful @xmath0 process , so in this section we investigate this possibility .",
    "we take the high accretion rate model @xmath13 , @xmath4 and an outflow with a fairly low entropy , s=10 and @xmath30 and a final velocity of @xmath37 .",
    "this is the same trajectory as shown as the solid line in fig .",

    ", @xmath4 will produce much higher electron fractions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : outflow]a , it can be seen that the material which has been irradiated by a large neutrino fluence because of its slow acceleration ( @xmath28 ) is very proton rich .",
    "this type of outflow will produce primarily nickel , but it will also produce some nuclei on the proton rich side of the valley of beta stability as well , such as @xmath40 , @xmath41,@xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for still lower accretion rate models , such as @xmath44 , @xmath19 the outflow will have an electron fraction which is closer to @xmath45 , although the neutrinos may drive the electron fraction up to as much as @xmath46 .",
    "winds of this type with entropies of order @xmath47 may have an unusual nucleosynthesis pattern with large overproduction factors of elements such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "lower spin parameter models are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the winds from accretion disks surrounding black holes in the context of gamma ray bursts are a new arena in which to investigate nucleosynthesis . the most important parameters which determine the elements formed in the outflow from the disk are the accretion rate and black hole spin parameter .",
    "this is because the density and temperature of the disk determine where the neutrinos and antineutrinos become trapped .",
    "neutrinos become trapped before antineutrinos , and in some disks only neutrinos are trapped , not antineutrinos . in these disks",
    "the wind is proton rich , from the reaction @xmath54 , and produces considerable nickel-56 , but also elements on the proton rich side of the valley of beta stability .",
    "however as the accretion rate increases , a sizable region of trapped antineutrinos can develop , and these antineutrinos cause the wind to become neutron rich .",
    "this happens because the higher temperature antineutrinos cause @xmath55 to be faster than the corresponding reaction for neutrinos .",
    "if the outflow is is slow enough , for example in our parameterization at around @xmath28 , or has low entropy @xmath1 , then the electron fraction is sufficiently low that @xmath0-process elements are produced in the outflow .",
