    "this work is devoted to the study of stabilization in coalition forming in a collective of individual actors under the influence of external fields .",
    "the model rests on the natural model of coalition forming @xcite inspired from the statistical physics model of spin glasses @xcite , through which the system of countries is compared to a collection of interacting spins ",
    "tiny magnetic dipoles that interact with each other and align themselves in a way to attain the most `` comfortable '' position , the one that minimizes their energies . while the presentation addresses the coalition forming in an aggregate of countries , the discussion and the results",
    "can be applied to any type of political , social or economical collectives where the association of actors takes place based on their bilateral propensities .",
    "this work subscribes to the growing field of modeling complex social situations using statistical physics @xcite which has started over thirty years ago with @xcite .",
    "later , a study of collective decision making combining social psychology hypotheses with recent concept of statistical physics @xcite set the frame of using spin hamiltonian .",
    "then , the coalition as a form of aggregation among a set of actors ( countries , groups , individuals ) has been studied using concepts from the theory of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "various social applications of the model were suggested @xcite .",
    "the dynamical analogue of this model was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the model of coalition forming among countries leans on the existence of strong and static bilateral geographic - ethnic propensities linking the countries .",
    "those propensities have emerged during the ongoing historical interactions between neighbor countries and appear to favor either cooperation or conflict .",
    "their spontaneous and independent evolution have produced an intricate circuit of bilateral bonds which causes contradictory tendencies in the simultaneous individual searches for optimal coalitions .",
    "due to stronger interactions with a common ally , conflicting countries may be brought to cooperate momentarily despite their natural tendency to conflict .",
    "such a situation produces an endeavor of the concerned countries to escape from the unfavorable cooperation leading to instabilities , which in turn produce a break down of the current coalitions inducing the formation of new ones .",
    "the origin of such instability is twofold , either coming from spontaneous fluctuations or directed by external attraction towards a global alliance .",
    "the extremely disordered dynamics of coalitions and fragmentation in western europe in past centuries belong to the first kind , while the building up of the soviet and nato global alliances is of the second kind .    in this work",
    "we aim to study the instability of coalition forming among countries , which , in contrast to physical entities , are rational actors that are able to maximize their individual benefits through a series of choices within a decentralized maximization process .    on this basis",
    ", coalitions are formed through the short range interactions between the countries  the attraction or repulsion based on the unalterable historical bonds between them . according to the principle that `` the enemy of an enemy is a friend '' , the countries are assumed to ally to one of two competing coalitions .",
    "allying to the same coalition is unfavorable to the countries which went through historical rejection . as a result ,",
    "such countries seek to affiliate with the opposite coalitions .",
    "alternatively , allying to the opposite coalition is unfavorable to friendly countries .",
    "countries which belong to the same coalition are expected to cooperate even if their natural propensity is to conflict .",
    "such a contradiction results in a potential instability .",
    "our previous study @xcite focused on studying the effects of instabilities arising in the coalition forming among rational actors as a function of the bonds structure , the optimal and non - optimal stabilizations as well as the robustness of the stability .    in this work",
    "the model is extended to investigate the mechanisms by which the setting of a global alliance produces attraction in an aggregate of individual countries otherwise connected by their natural bilateral propensities .",
    "in particular , the focus is on how those new interactions can eventually stabilize the intrinsically unstable process of coalition forming keeping the short range nature of interactions .",
    "global attraction is ensued from a global external field set over the system of countries , which in turn polarizes the countries interests and produces incentive unifications under two opposing _ global alliances_. the resulting coalitions are affected by the net bilateral balance between the new motivations and the traditional historical ones .",
    "we focus on how the interactions produced by attraction to global alliances overwhelm the current instability among the countries .",
    "the results provide new theoretical tools that enable to measure the efficiency of a global attraction in forming stable alliances , as well as to theoretically design new effective global attractions that can yield stability .",
    "the study of stabilization of coalitions using global alliances was started in @xcite .",
    "the authors describe spontaneous formation of economic coalitions given a random distribution of propensity bonds , and illustrate new exchanges between the countries incited by the global alliances .",
    "those exchanges , along with an additional parameter of economical and military pressure , are viewed as the ones that produce additional bilateral propensities yielding new stable coalitions .    in the current work",
    ", we develops further the research on coalition forming under a global external field .",
    "we address the stabilization by unique factors  such as economical , political , social , ecological , as well as by multi - factor stabilization , where the influence of several independent factors is equiprobable .",
    "based on the new formulation , we investigate the remarkable historical cases of conflicts in western europe .",
    "the multi - factor stabilization is an innovative concept both in political sciences where it explains the complexity of coalition forming , and in statistical physics where it illustrates how a stable disorder arises from an anti - ferromagnetic coupling achieved by the interlocking of two opposite ferromagnetic states .",
    "some forms of such mixed phases of ferromagnetism have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the spin glass model in statistical physics is an idealized model of bulk magnetism represented by a collection of interacting spins ",
    "atoms acting as a tiny dipole magnet with a mixture of ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "those magnets interact with each other seeking to align themselves parallel or anti - parallel in order to minimize their energies .",
    "the collection of spins forms a disordered material in which the competing interactions cause high magnetic frustration",
    " changes of spins at no energy cost , with a highly degenerate ground state .    the ising model of a random bond magnetic system can be described as follows .",
    "the model consists of @xmath0 discrete variables @xmath1 , called spins , that can be in one of two states _ up _ or _ down_. figure ( [ spin_glass ] ) shows schematically the case of @xmath2 spins with identical amplitude of the propensity bonds located on a lattice and interacting at most with their nearest neighbors .",
    "the spins for which a shift of the state cost no energy are defined as frustrated .",
    "-spins with mixed pair interactions .",
    "the pair propensity bonds are denoted by @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and states of the spins are denoted by the arrows .",
    "frustrated spins are marked by both up and down arrows .",
    "this spin glass phase yields an unstable disorder.,width=220 ]    the natural model of coalition forming is formally identical to the ising model with pure or mixed anti - ferromagnetic couplings in a particular geometry of the lattice .",
    "the model considers a system of @xmath0 countries whose historical interactions have defined propensity bonds between them , which are either positive ( ferromagnetic - like ) or negative ( anti - ferromagnetic - like ) . to each country labeled with an index @xmath5 ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath0 ,",
    "is attached a discrete variables @xmath7 which can assume one of two state values @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the values correspond to the country s choice between the two possible coalitions .",
    "the same choice allies two countries to the same coalition , while different choices separate them into the opposite coalitions .",
    "combination of states of all the countries @xmath10 forms a state configuration that defines an allocation of coalitions . here , by symmetry , both configuration @xmath11 and it s inverse @xmath12 define the same coalitions .",
    "bilateral propensities @xmath13 have emerged from the respective mutual historical experience between the countries @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "the propensities measure the amplitudes and the directions of the exchange between two countries  cooperation or conflict .",
    "@xmath13 , which is symmetric , is zero when there are no direct exchanges between the countries .    product @xmath15 measures the benefit or the gain from the interactions between both the countries as a function of their choices . aimed to maximize this measure ,",
    "the countries seek to ally to the same coalition when @xmath16 is positive and to the opposing ones , otherwise .",
    "thus , depending on the direction of the primary propensity , the conflict can be beneficial to the same extent as the cooperation .",
    "the sum of the benefits from all the interactions of country @xmath5 in the system makes up the net gain of the country : @xmath17 thus , a configuration @xmath11 that maximizes the gain function defines the country s most beneficial coalition setting .    for the sake of visualization , we depict the system of countries through a connected weighted graph with the countries in the nodes and the bilateral propensities as the weights of the respective edges ( see figure ( [ trian_natural_m ] ) ) .",
    "we take red ( dark ) color for the @xmath18 choice and blue ( light ) color for the @xmath19 choice .    ,",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 with negative mutual bonds . , width=144 ]    the total gain of the system of countries is identical to the hamiltonian of an ising random bond magnetic system which represents the energy of the system . for a configuration @xmath11",
    ", we have for system s gain : @xmath22    in physical systems , the hamiltonian  the function that determines the physical properties of the spin system , is precisely concerned with minimization of the system s energy .",
    "this physical analogy allows to address the bilateral propensities between the countries as mean of maximization of the countries individual gain ( minimization of their energy ) and as the principal guide in the coalition forming .",
    "a major difference between the model of spins and the model of rational countries is the long horizon rationality of the countries in contrast to the spins , which are only able to foresee only the immediate effect of their shifts .",
    "countries have the ability to maximize their individual benefits through a series of planned changes while assuming possible losses in the intermediate phase .",
    "the ising model , indeed , can be represented through the natural model where the countries rationality is limited to observation of an immediate gain , optimizing only their local maximums .",
    "when the most beneficial coalition configurations of different countries do not coincide , the maximization of individual gains induces competitions for the beneficial associations . among the countries with complete rationality which are aware of attainability of a better configuration , those competing interactions cause endless instability in the system .",
    "however , the system may remain stable when some actors have limited rationality ",
    "being unaware of possibility to attain a better configuration , they are satisfied having reached a local maximum .    figure ( [ trian_nat_config ] )",
    "shows the triangle of conflict in a configuration where it is stable when the countries @xmath20 s and @xmath21 s rationality is limited to immediate improvements ; any change cause a loss in their gain .",
    "the triangle is unstable when the countries are fully rational : their most beneficial configurations @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , do not coincide . here , at any coalition configuration , at least two of the countries improves their gain when the other changes . as a result , aiming in their best configurations and being able to forecast an improvement at any step , the countries may make changes that impair the gain in the immediate steps .",
    "s and @xmath21 s rationality is limited to immediate improvements ; any change cause a loss in their gain .",
    "the triangle is unstable when the countries are fully rational : their most beneficial configurations do not coincide and the countries , being able to forecast an improvement , make changes that impair the gain in the immediate steps . ,",
    "width=144 ]    it is interesting to note that for the case of equal propensities over the edges , the triangle of conflict is unstable for any limited rationality actors , including the spins , due to zero - value gain produced in the cyclic geometry resulting in no - cost frustrations .",
    "the system of countries is said to be unstable if in any configuration of the countries states there is a country which is able to forecast an improvement of its gain",
    ".    negative product on a circle means an unpaired negative coupling where two neighbors are found to be connected both though positive and negative branch in the circle .",
    "this creates an everlasting competition between the neighbors for the exclusive arrangement to ally with the positive branch .",
    "the countries thereby continuously shift their respective choices producing the instability .    in statistical physics the necessary condition of instabilities in spin glasses",
    "@xcite reads that @xmath26 indeed , the spin glasses instability is a result of frustrations , and a negative circle can appear to be stable as soon as a shift increases the spin energy preventing the spin flop .",
    "in contrast to the spin glass model where changes are limited to the spontaneous no - cost fluctuations , in the natural model where the instability is due to the rationality of actors , changes may impair the immediate gain . in the theoretical interpretation of the model",
    "where the complete rationality of all countries is assumed , the terms ( [ stab_spins ] ) are also the sufficient condition of the instability in the model  the condition of endless competitions among the countries for the beneficial configurations .    formally , the theoretical terms of instability in the natural model are as follows .",
    "denote a circle of countries by @xmath27 and the countries composing the circle by @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29    let us remark that , in the theoretical interpretation of the model where the complete rationality of all countries is assumed , the instability is not value - dependent but is determined by the signs of the propensities  the distribution is such that involves a negative circle .",
    "at the same time , any local maximum strictly depends on the propensities values .",
    "global alliance model starts from a global principle which represents an external field polarizing the interests of the countries .",
    "this leads to the emergence of two opposing global alliances .",
    "the countries attach themselves to one or to the other based on their pragmatic interests with respect to the global principle . the new interactions , while favor either cooperation or conflict , stimulates contributions to the countries mutual propensities .",
    "the new prospectives unify or separate the countries based on the pragmatic motivations which in combination with the historical concerns allow other distributions of coalitions .    here",
    "we address the role of the global alliances in forming of stable coalitions among the countries or other rational actors . whether the system is unstable or there is an optimal or local maximum stable configuration , the new exchanges between the countries incited by the global alliances impact the stability . for the sake of simplicity of presentation , we assume the extensive rationality of the countries . while in such theoretical interpretation the instability is not value - dependent , the effect from the globally generated additional propensities on the stability is subject to the values of primary propensities .",
    "therefore , in spite of the extensive rationality of the countries , in the presentation we address the model with arbitrary range of values .",
    "let us define the global alliance model formally .",
    "the global alliance unifies the countries that support the global principle , while its opponents are unified under the opposing global alliance .",
    "denote the two alliances by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "a country s individual disposition to the alliances is determined by the countries cultural and historical experiences and is expressed through the parameter of _ natural belonging_. the natural belonging parameter of country @xmath5 is @xmath32 if the country has natural attraction to alliance @xmath30 , @xmath33 for @xmath31 .    by making a choice among the two possible state values @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 , country @xmath5 chooses to belong to either alliance @xmath30 or @xmath31 . the choice of @xmath18 allies the country to alliance @xmath30 and the choice of @xmath19 allies it to alliance @xmath31 .",
    "any particular distribution of two countries among the alliances creates new interactions between the countries whose directions depends on the natural disposition of the countries .",
    "namely , if the countries are attracted to the opposing alliances , the exchange will be negative as soon as they ally to the same alliance .    those new exchanges between any two countries @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath14 define additional propensity between the countries .",
    "the propensity is the amplitude of the exchange @xmath34 in the direction @xmath35 that favors either cooperation or conflict . for the purpose of this presentation",
    "we assume that the exchange amplitudes are unchanged .",
    "the overall propensities between the countries , involving both the historical inclinations and the propensities resulting from the new exchanges , are determined as follows @xmath36 respectively , the net gain of country @xmath5 is @xmath37    thus , in the presence of external incentives of the global alliances , the couplings between the countries obtain new guidance .",
    "the countries adjust their states to the best benefit with regards to the new propensities .",
    "the new choice of coalition is determined by both spontaneous reactions and planned interactions , which enable coupling based on a planned profit .",
    "here we address the stabilization of coalition forming in the system where rational countries have no optimal configuration of coalitions , and where , as result , the spontaneous stabilization can not be attained .",
    "global alliances based interactions in such systems enable stable coalitions among the actors even if they remain of short - range nature . such interactions , however , being a complex superposition of several factors of countries objectives , must satisfy particular stability constraints .",
    "consider two opposing global alliances @xmath30 and @xmath31 in a system of @xmath0 countries .",
    "a particular factor of the countries interests produces specific dispositions to the global alliances which encourage new exchanges between the countries .",
    "the appropriate amplitudes of the exchanges enable the stabilization among the countries , the _ uni - factor stabilization_.    with respect of unique factor of stabilization , the necessary and sufficient condition stability ( reformulated terms  ( [ stab_countr ] ) ) is that @xmath38    now we state the existence of a stable coalition within the global alliance model .",
    "the presence of global alliances , regardless of the global principle that produced them , enables a stable coalition among countries .    in order to prove this statement ,",
    "let us first observe that the product of the additional propensities @xmath39 on any circle is always positive .",
    "indeed , given circle @xmath27 , @xmath40 this implies that on any circle , the number of negative couplings produced by the global alliances is even . if the system is unstable , than there is at least one negative circle .",
    "we define the new interaction amplitude as follows . for each couple @xmath41 whose @xmath42 we take @xmath43 if the primary propensity is negative and @xmath44 for the positive original coupling .",
    "when @xmath45 , we take @xmath44 .    making the new propensities negative for the negative global couplings and positive for the positive ones ,",
    "guarantees that there is an even number of negative couplings on the circle .",
    "this remains invariant for each circle in the system , which implies that the construction produces non - negative product on any circle in the system .",
    "the stability condition ( [ glob_total_prop_eq ] ) holds true which concludes the proof of the statement .      a typical examples of the uni - factor stabilization is stabilization of the triangle of england , spain and france ( [ engspfr ] ) during historical events of @xmath46 @xcite .

    "the franco - russian relationship built up during the french revolutionary and the napoleonic wars is are rather `` neutral - negative '' with @xmath103 , as well as the interactions of france with italy and austria who had experienced series of military conflicts . the opposition between italy and austria tied to the mutual territorial claims is estimated to be `` significantly - negative '' with @xmath104 ) .",
    "figure ( [ fiar ] ) shows the system of the countries in its natural model .",
    "the model has two negative circles and so is unstable which appears through the historical changes before the rise of the italian question .",
    "the instability originates from the fact that france gets identical benefits from the alliance with russia and italy as from the opposing alliance with austria .    an external field in the model results from the principle of independent state of italy .",
    "the respective opposing global alliances are @xmath30 which associates the countries that support the independence of italy , and @xmath31 which unifies the countries opposing the independence .    here , two respective factors influencing the historical series of events must be distinguished : external politics with the military goals , and internal politics involving the social concerns of the countries ( their governing classes ) .",
    "denote the two factors by @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "with respect to their external goals , italy and france , as well as russia , agree to the relevance of an independent state of italy . yet , in the social concerns the governing classes of france , russia and austria agree in their rejection of socialist ideas springing over all the italy .",
    "therefore , the respective parameters of the countries natural belonging to the alliances are distributed as follows . with the natural belonging parameter @xmath105 referring the external goals and @xmath106 referring the internal social politics , for france @xmath107 and @xmath108 , for italy @xmath109 and @xmath110 , for russia @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and for austria @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the global alliance motivated propensities are given is the following chart :     primary & -1 & -2 & -1 & -1 & 1 +    on @xmath75 & @xmath115 & @xmath116 & @xmath117 & @xmath118 & @xmath119 +    on @xmath76 & @xmath120 & @xmath121 & @xmath122 & @xmath123 & @xmath124 +    the historical chronicle of the four countries is concluded in three phases : a phase of no global alliances , or the natural model phase , and two phases of global alliances rose due to the italian question , where in the first one the external and military concerns come to picture and in the second one the internal social concerns rise over the countries .    as we have seen in figure ( [ fiar ] ) , the system in its natural model is unstable , where france fluctuates between russia and austria .",
    "let us evaluated the amplitudes of the military exchanges between the countries through numerical values providing the relative magnitudes of interactions .",
    "russia has equally `` moderate '' interest in military cooperation with both france and austria , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "italy and france are `` strongly '' interested in the conflict having italian land at stake , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , while the interest between austria and france is `` moderately - strong '' with @xmath129 .",
    "a sympathy of russian to italian state comes up in the `` basic '' interest , @xmath130 .",
    "the new propensities between the countries with respect to the external politics interests are shown in the following table :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the result system with the french change in favor of cooperation with austria is shown in figure ( [ fiar2 ] ) . as we can see the modified system includes three negative circles .",
    "the change of france put russia in an unfavorable position moving it away from a most beneficial coalition configuration . at the same time , italy and austria found themselves in a satisfactory state .",
    "coalitions in a collective of individual rational actors such as countries , when formed spontaneously are rare to stabilize .",
    "the probability that the system becomes stable vanishes exponentially with the size of the system . in reality ,",
    "stabilization among countries as rational actors is more likely to happen under the external incentive of global alliances and is more practical . the impact of the global principle on the economical , political , social or any other factor of the countries interests produces new , intended , interactions between the countries .",
    "in contrast to the spontaneous primary interactions , those interactions are intended in the sense that they are based on the directed view of the countries s needs and interests .",
    "superposed with the spontaneous ones , the interactions guarantee the stabilization once their amplitudes satisfy the constraints of positive circuits of propensities .",
    "one of the interesting directions for further research in the context of the global alliance model is to study the general effect from the global attractions , that is the general interaction amplitudes .",
    "while some global attractions represent efficient mediators , the others may be less successful or even harmful with respect to the system s stability .",
    "because either they become obsolete , or provide no sufficient motivations , or they acts with harmful intentions , the global alliance may fail to stabilize an unstable system , and even may destabilize a stable system .",
    "it is interesting to study those effects from general perspective of the system s total gain ( energy ) , which can be reduced or augmented by the global alliances .",
    "the study should help shed the new light on conflicts in post colonial africa and middle east which , being under the influence of external fields , continuously cycle in series of contentions ."
