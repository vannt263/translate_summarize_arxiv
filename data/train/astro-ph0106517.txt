    "such disks should soon evolve into protoplanetary disks .",

    "the polarization pattern indicates that the disk is seen almost edge - on causing the band of enhanced extinction in between the scattering lobes . at the very center ,",
    "the polarization vectors are aligned linearly .",
    "this could be either due to photons scattered back from the envelope onto the disk or because of multiple scattering in the outer disk regions .",

    "[ fig_cores]b ) .",
    "the high - velocity line wings from the inner parts of the disk expected for a keplerian disk are not recovered in the data because of the small band width .",

    "the cb26 disk compared to the solar system . the grey scale image and contours show the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission from the cb26 disk as observed with ovro . for comparison ,",
    "the solar system is represented by the orbits of jupiter and neptune and the kuiper belt ( 4070au ) . ]    from ovro millimeter interferometric observations we discovered and resolved the thermal dust continuum and @xmath16co line emission from the circumstellar disk in cb26 which was recently implied by high - resolution nir polarimetric observations .",
    "the disk is seen edge - on as predicted by the nir observations and matches well the extinction lane at the center of the bipolar nir reflection nebula .",
    "it has a fwhm diameter of ( 220@xmath5320)au and a maximum ( traced ) diameter of @xmath3400au .",
    "the ( projected ) scale height remains unresolved ( @xmath5420au ) .",
    "for the first time , we directly detect a warp in a young circumstellar disk .",
    "the warp affects the disk outside @xmath55au . like in many extra - galactic disks , such a warp could be caused by a small external disturbance like , e.g. , an encounter with a nearby star .",
    "however , the actual cause of the warp is not known .",
    "the 1.3 mm dust emission from the inner @xmath56au of the disk is highly optically thick , and only a lower limit to the total disk mass @xmath47m@xmath1  can be derived from the 3 mm emission . due to the high optical depths , no constraints on the dust opacity spectral index @xmath40  and possible planetesimal growth in the inner undisturbed part of the disk can be drawn .",
    "the dust emission from the outer parts of the disk is optically thin and arises from small classical grains .",
    "however , since the outer disk is obviously disturbed as indicated by the warp and has much lower particle densities , this does not exclude that particle growth in the inner disk has already taken place .",
    "the small disk envelope , which extends above and below the plane of the disk and may be related to an yet undetected outflow or a disk wind , contains @xmath57m@xmath1 .",
    "further @xmath34m@xmath1  are contained in a more extended envelope ( @xmath58au in diameter ) which extends mainly to the north - east and may represent the remnant , nearly dispersed protostellar core from which this system has formed @xcite .",
    "strong @xmath16co emission shows that the disk must be still gas rich , that it is rotating , and has a kinetic temperature of order 30k outside @xmath56au .",
    "the rotation curve is consistent with keplerian rotation around a ( 0.35@xmath530.1)m@xmath1  star . with a total luminosity of @xmath8l@xmath1 , its large disk and its close connection with the parental cloud core ,",
    "the cb26 system resembles an intermediate m type ttauri star of age @xmath59yrs .",
    "the lack of a dense , centrally peaked cloud core with spectroscopic infall signatures as well as of a prominent molecular outflow indicates that the system has already passed its main accretion phase .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this is a young protoplanetary disk .    if compared to the solar system today , the cb26 disk is @xmath60   times larger than the outer kuiper belt ( fig . [ fig_solsys ] ) .",
    "however , the optically thick and undisturbed part inside the warp has approximately the size of the kuiper belt . the total mass in the cb26 disk ( if all the gas is still there ) is at least 10 times higher than the planetary mass in the solar system .",
    "however , the dust mass in the cb26 disk could be comparable or lower than the rocky mass in the solar system .",
    "these numbers depend critically on the dust properties which are not well - known .",
    "altogether , the cb26 system appears like a 23 times lower - mass equivalent to the early solar nebula at the verge of forming planetesimals and probably planets .",
