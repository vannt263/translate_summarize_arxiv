    "<S> it is seen here that in the near - equilibrium regime , all the curves merge into each other and approach the ca value which is approximately @xmath73 in this limit . </S>",

    "<S> the optimal efficiency exhibits a universal form , independent of @xmath66 and given by @xmath80.,width=302 ]    [ fig2 ]    so far we have observed that the use of jeffreys prior implies that efficiency at optimal work approaches ca value for arbitrary bath temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> further , the efficiency also approaches a universal form for a class of priors , for nearly equal bath temperatures . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we show that application of bayes theorem can restore the efficiency back to the exact ca value even for the latter choice . </S>",
    "<S> bayes theorem gives a prescription to convert the prior probabilities @xmath81 into posterior probabilities . </S>",

    "<S> so using posterior probabilities , a well defined expression for average work is obtained even if the prior is non - normalisable in the asymptotic limit . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , given the value of external parameter @xmath11 and assuming canonical probabilities @xmath96 to find the system in @xmath10th state , we infer the probability @xmath97 about the value of @xmath11 , if the system is actually found in the @xmath10th state . remarkably , the work given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ finalw ] ) attains optimal value exactly at the ca efficiency , regardless of the value of @xmath66 in the prior . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the average work @xmath98 shows the same dependence on efficiency @xmath34 as found for the classical otto cycle in @xcite .    in conclusion , we have argued the emergence of ca value as the efficiency at optimal work in quantum heat engines within a bayesian framework . </S>",
    "<S> this effect of incorporating bayesian probabilities leading to classical thermodynamic behavior in quantum systems has not been addressed before and may shed new light on the connection between information and thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> due to current interest in small scale engines , the observation of similar curves ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) as obtained in some recently proposed models of these engines , points to an interesting link between finite time models and our model based on the idea of prior information . </S>",
    "<S> addressing these issues would hopefully lead to a broader perspective on the performance characteristics of small engines and also help to understand the limits of their performance based on principles of information . </S>"
