    "by improving a lattice action , one hopes that calculations at a fixed lattice spacing will be closer to their continuum values than with the original action , and similarly that calculations of a fixed accuracy can be performed on coarser lattices than those required , for example , by the wilson action . for the present work",
    ", we consider an action which has classical errors beginning only at @xmath2 , and which is also tadpole - improved@xcite .",
    "this action has been used to compute the spectrum of light hadron masses@xcite , and it was found that hadron mass ratios are considerably improved compared to wilson action results at comparable lattice spacings . in this work",
    "we address the question of whether matrix elements are similarly improved by considering the vector current renormalization factor and vector meson decay constant .",
    "we use an improved gauge field action which involves a sum over 1@xmath32 plaquettes as well as 1@xmath31 plaquettes@xcite , and an improved fermion action which contains next - nearest - neighbour interactions@xcite , @xmath4 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "the presence of three timesteps in a single term of the action introduces artifacts@xcite , such as oscillations in meson mass functions near the source .",
    "however on our lattices , the plateau itself is not altered .",
    "in the continuum , the @xmath0 meson decay constant @xmath6 is defined as follows : @xmath7 on a lattice , matrix elements of the vector current get renormalized by a factor @xmath8 , @xmath9 where the dots represent finite lattice spacing effects . for the improved action ,",
    "the @xmath10 terms vanish identically and terms proportional to the coupling are kept small by the tadpole factor . by considering the ratio of the local vector current @xmath11 to the conserved vector current @xmath12",
    ", we can compute the renormalization factor , @xmath13 we will consider a variety of choices for the initial and final states in this ratio , and the differences in the resulting values for @xmath8 will reflect the finite lattice spacing effects .",
    "we have performed calculations at two values of @xmath14 with the improved action which correspond to lattice spacings of 0.4fm and 0.27fm as derived from the string tension . for comparison",
    ", we have also used the wilson action to calculate at the same lattice spacings . for the gauge fields we used pseudo - heatbath updating with periodic boundary conditions ;",
    "the first 4000 sweeps were discarded and then 250 sweeps ( 200 sweeps ) were discarded between each pair of improved ( wilson ) configurations that was kept .    a stabilized biconjugate gradient algorithm was used for the fermion matrix inversion at three choices of the hopping parameter . due to the modest number of lattice sites ,",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions were used for fermions propagating in the time direction but periodic boundaries were used in all spacial directions .",
    "the source was placed two timesteps away from the boundary .",

    "( [ ratio ] ) , @xmath22    the extrapolation to the chiral limit was done linearly in @xmath23 .",
    "the results of wilson calculations by other groups are also shown .",
    "notice that for both actions , @xmath8 at fixed @xmath24 is approximately independent of the amplitude used , except for the decay amplitude which predicts a smaller value for @xmath8 . for fixed lattice spacing ,",
    "the improved action does give improved values of @xmath8 ; in fact the improved action matches the wilson predictions for @xmath8 when the lattice spacing is larger by a factor of about three .",
    "figure  [ fig : sinz ] shows that the dependence on @xmath25 is also quite similar for the two actions .",
    "figure  [ fig : fvnoz ] shows the _ lattice _ decay constant ( i.e. without @xmath8 ) .",
    "again , we find that the improved action does give improved results when compared to wilson calculations at the same lattice spacing , and that the improved prediction is similar to the wilson prediction at 1/3 of the lattice spacing .",
    "our best determination of the decay constant comes from the product of @xmath8 and @xmath26 , and this is shown in figure  [ fig : fv ] .",
    "the cluster of data points which lie above the experimental result rely on tadpole - improved perturbation theory to estimate @xmath8 .",
    "notice that the completely nonperturbative determinations of @xmath27 are quite flat over a substantial range of lattice spacing , and that for both the wilson and improved actions the result is near experiment .    in summary , we have found that the @xmath1 classical and tadpole improvements of our action manifest themselves in vector current matrix elements in essentially the same way as in masses@xcite .",
    "improved action results for @xmath27 and @xmath8 are consistent with wilson action computations done at a lattice spacing about 1/3 the size .",
