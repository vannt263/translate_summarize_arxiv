    "the nonlinear dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators has attracted considerable attention in recent years .",
    "such coupled oscillators are used to model many physical , chemical , and biological systems such as coupled p - n junctions @xcite , josephson - junction arrays @xcite , the charge - density waves @xcite , chemical - reaction systems @xcite , and biological - oscillation systems @xcite .",
    "they exhibit diverse bifurcations , multistability , chaos , pattern formation , and so on .",
    "the coupled nonlinear oscillators studied here are coupled inverted pendulums , consisting of @xmath0 identical inverted pendulum coupled through some interaction mechanism .",
    "we first consider a constituent element of the coupled dynamical system , i.e. , a single parametrically forced pendulum with a vertically - oscillating suspension point .",
    "it can be described by a normalized equation of motion @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a normalized angle with range @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a normalized damping parameter , @xmath9 is the normalized natural frequency of the unforced pendulum , and @xmath2 is the normalized driving amplitude of the vertical oscillation of the suspension point , respectively .",
    "this parametrically forced pendulum has an `` inverted '' stationary state , corresponding to the vertically - up configuration with @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that as the parameter @xmath2 is increased , the inverted pendulum undergoes a cascade of `` resurrections , '' i.e. , it becomes stabilized after its instability , destabilize again and so forth _ ad infinitum _ @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied bifurcations and transitions to chaos associated with such resurrections of the inverted pendulum @xcite . for each case of the resurrections , the stabilized inverted state exhibits an infinite sequence of period - doubling bifurcations accumulating at a period - doubling transition point @xmath11 , beyond which chaos sets in .",
    "consequently , an infinite series of period - doubling transitions to chaos occur successively with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) map @xcite , where only single period - doubling transition to chaos takes place .",
    "however , the critical scaling behaviors at each @xmath12th period - doubling transition point @xmath13 @xmath14 are the same as those for the 1d map .",
    "in this paper we study the critical behaviors of period doublings in the system of @xmath0 @xmath1 symmetrically coupled inverted pendulums by varying the driving amplitude @xmath2 and the strength @xmath3 of coupling between the inverted pendulums , and also compare them with those for the abstract system of the coupled 1d maps @xcite .",
    "the `` coupling effect '' of the strength and range of coupling on the critical behaviors are particularly investigated .",
    "both the structure of the critical set and the critical scaling behaviors for the coupled inverted pendulums are found to be the same as those for the coupled 1d maps found by one of us ( kim ) and kook @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
