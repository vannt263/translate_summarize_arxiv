    "since the discovery of the polarized broad line region ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) , the standard model for the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 is of a seyfert 1 nucleus hidden behind a thick obscuring torus . there is much observational support for this model ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "contrary to the powerful nuclear activity observed at some other wavelengths , the weakness of the observed x - ray luminosity and failure to detect any direct component , even up to 20 kev , strongly suggests that the direct x - ray radiation from the central source is blocked entirely from our direct view ( koyama et al 1989 ; mulchaey et al 1995 ) .",
    "the lack of low energy absorption in the x - ray spectrum was interpreted as evidence that the observed x - rays are the scattered radiation of a hidden seyfert 1 nucleus ( e.g. , elvis & lawrence 1988 ) . however , extended soft x - ray emission ( @xmath4 kpc ) is resolved with the rosat hri ( wilson et al 1992 ) , and an asca spectrum shows thermal emission , probably coming from the spatially extended circumnuclear starburst , dominates in the soft x - ray band ( ueno et al 1994 ) .",
    "the asca spectrum then no longer looks like a seyfert 1 , indicating very steep thermal emission below 3 kev ( which now agrees with the einstein observatory ipc measurement by monier & halpern 1984 ) and only above 3 kev , where a flat continuum ( @xmath5 ) with strong iron k lines ( ueno et al 1994 ) is seen , is emission presumed to originate from the active nucleus",
    ".    based on the unification model , a large equivalent width ( ew ) of the iron k line was predicted by krolik & kallman ( 1987 ) .",
    "this was later verified by a ginga observation ( @xmath6 kev , koyama et al 1989 ; smith et al 1993 ) .",
    "the line centroid energy of the iron k line was @xmath7 kev which suggested a blend of cold and ionized lines , but it could not be resolved at the spectral resolution of the ginga lac ( turner et al 1989 ) .",
    "a subsequent bbxrt observation resolved the iron k line feature into three components for the first time ( marshall et al 1993 ) .",
    "they were identified with cold fe ( less ionized than fexvii at 6.4 kev ) , fexxv and fexxvi .",
    "several attempts to explain the iron k line feature have been made ( band et al 1991 ; marshall et al 1994 ) , assuming that all x - ray emission is scattered light from the active nucleus and the scattering medium is optically thin in order to account for the lack of low energy absorption .",
    "the observed continuum above 3 kev is unusually flat compared with that in seyfert 1 galaxies observed with asca ( @xmath8 ; nandra et al 1996 ; reynolds 1996 ) .",
    "together with the presence of a strong 6.4 kev line , this instead suggests that reflection from cold , thick matter is an important component , as observed in other seyfert 2 galaxies such as ngc6552 ( fukazawa et al 1994 ) and the circinus galaxy ( matt et al 1996a ) . to account for the three line components , matt , brandt & fabian ( 1996 ) proposed a composite scenario in which two distinct reflections from an optically thick torus and an optically thin , warm scattering mirror together compose the observed x - ray spectrum of ngc1068 .",
    "we report here the discovery of a compton shoulder on the 6.4 kev fluorescence iron k line and a spectral analysis of the asca pv data based on the model by matt et al ( 1996b ) .",
    "we assume the distance of ngc1068 to be 22 mpc throughout this paper .",
    "ngc1068 was observed on 1993 july 24 with asca ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) during the performance verification ( pv ) phase .",
    "initial results have been published by ueno et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use only the solid state imaging spectrometer ( sis ; s0 and s1 ) data , because of their superior spectral resolution for resolving the iron k line complex .",
    "the source data of 38 ks are extracted from a circular region of a radius 3.2 arcmin , and the background data are taken from a source - free field in the same detector .",
    "spectral fits are performed with the s0 and s1 data jointly while the figures presented are made by summing both detectors for display purposes .",
    "errors on each spectral parameter are given at the 90 per cent confidence level for one interesting parameter .",
    ".four gaussian fit to the iron k line complex .",
    "the line width of each component is assumed to be @xmath9 ev , since no significant broadnening ( @xmath10 ev ) is found .",
    "the ews are with respect to the single power - law continuum with galactic absorption ( see text ) .",
    "line - intensity ratios to the 6.4 kev line ( i / i@xmath11 ) are also shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the 210 kev fluxes of the two components estimated from the best - fit model are @xmath12  for the cold reflection , and @xmath13  for the warm scattered continuum .",
    "confidence contours of the corresponding luminosities are given in fig .",
    "4 , using a distance of 22 mpc .",
    "the best - fit values in the 210 kev band are @xmath14  for the cold reflection continuum and @xmath15  for the warm reflection continuum , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the luminosity is integrated over @xmath16 for the cold reflection because of the assumed geometry whilst over @xmath17 for the warm reflection .",
    "however , for a direct comparison of observed intensity between the two components , the cold reflection luminosity multiplied by 2 is shown in fig .",
    "if significantly large absorption ( say , @xmath18 ) or a starburst component is included in the fit , the value of @xmath19 would be reduced slightly .",
    "fitting the data in a higher energy band ( e.g. 410 kev ) gives poorer constraints on @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "results are consistent with those in fig .",
    "4 , although the warm reflection component is not necessary at the 90 per cent confidence level .",
    "a rough estimate of the intrinsic x - ray luminosity can be obtained using the warm scattering luminosity @xmath21  derived from the composite model fit . for highly - ionized iron such as fexxv and fexxvi",
    ", resonant scattering plays an important role in making the ew large , if the scattering medium is optically thin ( band et al 1991 ; matt et al 1996 ) , but it is easily suppressed below the large observationally inferred values ( table 2 ) when the column density is , say , larger than @xmath22  ( e.g. , see matt et al 1996b ) .",
    "this indicates that the optical depth of the warm scattering mirror is small enough to allow efficient resonant scattering . thus assuming a scattering depth ( @xmath23 ) of 0.002@xmath24 so that the column density of the scattering mirror is @xmath25 , and the fraction of the sky occupied by the scattering mirror , @xmath26 , the intrinsic luminosity is estimated to be @xmath27  in the 210 kev band , where the density and depth of the scattering medium are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and @xmath19 is the measured luminosity of the warm reflection continuum . this estimate is entirely independent of data in other wavebands .",
    "there are further possible ways to estimate the intrinsic luminosity . using the correlation between x - ray and [ oiii]@xmath30 luminosities ( log@xmath31}/{\\rm log}l_{\\rm 2 - 10kev } \\sim -1.8 $ ] ) derived by mulchaey et al ( 1995 )",
    ", the 210 kev luminosity would be @xmath32 .",
    "note that the [ oiii ] flux was measured with a large aparture ( 1015 arcsec , see whittle 1992 ) containing the strong starburst region which could contribute some fraction of the flux .",
    "the estimate from the above , x - ray based , argument is consistent with this value . for a comparison ,",
    "the far infrared luminosity measured with iras is @xmath33(e.g . , david , jones & forman 1993 ) ,",
    "although this does contain a significant contribution from the circumnuclear starburst .",
    "the detection of the compton shoulder of the 6.4 kev iron fluorescent line is strong evidence that we are seeing reflection from optically thick , cold matter .",
    "the presence of the neutral calcium line supports this .",
    "the flat 410 kev continuum ( @xmath34 ) suggests that cold reflection is a major component of the observed x - ray emission from the active nucleus which dominates the observed radiation only in the energy band above 3 kev .",
    "in fact , the fit with the composite model of cold and warm reflections ( section 2.2 ) indicates that @xmath35 per cent of the total 210 kev flux comes from cold reflection .",
    "presumably the cold reflection occurs at the inner surface of the optically - thick , obscuring torus which entirely blocks the direct radiation from the central source in our direction ( ghisellini , haardt & matt 1993 ; matt et al 1996b ) .",
    "for such a geometry only part of the reflection surface is visible to us .",
    "if that fraction is @xmath36 , the observed luminosity is described as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total albedo of a cold reflector subtending a solid angle of @xmath16 . using values of @xmath39(see section 2.2 and fig .",
    "4 ) , @xmath40 ( in the 210 kev band ) , and @xmath41  ( see section 3.1 ) , @xmath36 is then found to be @xmath42 .",
    "the small value for @xmath36 suggests a high inclination of the obscuring torus ( close to edge - on ) if its inner surface is the reflecting source .",
    "alternatively a torus of a small radial / axial ratio ( pier & krolik 1993 ) is also possible , if it is not nearly edge - on .",
    "recent water maser observations by gallimore et al ( 1996 ) and greenhill et al ( 1996 ) suggest a high inclination @xmath43 degrees of the maser disk which is on a pc scale with a toroidal geometry and is identified with the x - ray absorbing gas torus at large optical depth ( i.e. , @xmath44 , koyama et al 1989 ) . a rather broad [ oiii]@xmath30 emission - line cone ( projected opening angle @xmath45 6580@xmath46 , cecil , bland & tully 1990 ; evans et al 1991 ) also favours an edge - on torus over one with a large scale - height .",
    "another possible cold reflector is the cold gas in the bulge and disk of the host galaxy ( fabian 1977 ) .",
    "strong 6.4 kev line emission is observed from molecular clouds in our galactic centre , where a strong iron k line emitter is sgr b2 , @xmath2 pc away from the galactic centre .",
    "the x - ray spectrum there also shows a complex of iron k lines ( koyama et al 1996 ) .",
    "as the stellar disk of ngc1068 is almost face - on , contrary to the torus , radiation from the central source escaping from the torus can pass through some of the cold gas clouds in the host galaxy .",
    "the likely distances of cold clouds from the active nucleus and the disk - like geometry make the covering factor small , and consistent with the small @xmath36 .",
    "if this is the case , future high spatial resolution mission like axaf would resolve a conical shape to the iron k line emission .",
    "the cold reflection spectrum has been studied by many authors ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ; reynolds et al 1994 ) .",
    "the cold reflection - dominated spectrum in ngc1068 predicts that a spectral break due to compton down - scattering would be observed around 30 kev .",
    "this is consistent with the cgro / osse upper limit and may be observable with high quality data from rxte and sax .",
    "cold reflection is a unique phenomenon at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "warm scattering is much more relevant to the observed optical / uv scattering .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity of the warm - scattered continuum is @xmath47 , which implies a scattering fraction in the warm matter to be @xmath48 .",
    "various other observations of ngc1068 suggest that the scattering fraction is approximately 1 per cent ( summarized in pier et al 1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray scattering fraction appears to be an order of magnitude lower .",
    "pier et al ( 1994 ) deduced the bolometric luminosity of ngc1068 to be @xmath49 , where the scattering fraction is 0.01@xmath50 .",
    "since they assumed that the whole hard x - ray emission above 2 kev ( as observed with bbxrt , marshall et al 1993 ) is scattered by the warm mirror , contrary to our result , their estimate has been modified slightly .    if the two higher energy lines are due to fexxv and fexxvi , the ionization parameter of the warm scattering matter , @xmath51 , is about several hundreds ( kallman & mccray 1982 ; krolik & kallman 1987 ; band et al 1991 ) , where @xmath52 is a distance of the scattering medium from the central source . assuming @xmath53 ,",
    "the column density can be written as @xmath54 . since @xmath55 , @xmath56 if @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( e.g. , evans et al 1991 ) are taken , then the size of the scattering region is approximately @xmath59 pc .",
    "this is large enough to be visible to us without occultation by a pc - scale torus ; direct x - ray imaging of this is impossible at present as the angular size is the order of 0.1 arcsec ( @xmath60 11 pc at d = 22 mpc ) .",
    "the size of the optical / uv scattering nebula observed by spectropolarimetry with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) is several tens pc or up to 200 pc ( antonucci et al 1994 ; capetti et al 1995 ) , the warm x - ray mirror is therefore smaller . the column density @xmath61 , which is small enough to allow efficient production of the resonant scattering lines of fexxv and fexxvi as mentioned in section 3.1 . to maintain the high value of @xmath62 in order to emit the highly ionized iron lines over a large scale , a low mean electron density such as @xmath63 @xmath64",
    "is required .",
    "we have discussed x - ray scattering from a warm medium in the context of the standard unification model as proposed by krolik & kallman ( 1987 ) and matt et al ( 1996b ) , i.e. , the scattering medium is located outside the obscuring torus and is directly visible to us . however , there are some problems : ( 1 ) a very small scattering fraction @xmath65 ; ( 2 ) disagreement of line energies discussed below ; and ( 3 ) the location of the region where the higher energy lines are formed .",
    "we note that the line energies for the two higher energy lines ( 6.61 kev and 6.86 kev ) disagree with the energies of the resonant lines of fexxv , 6.70 kev , and fexxvi , 6.97 kev , ( see table 1 ) whilst that of the cold iron k line agrees with 6.40 kev perfectly .",
    "the shift of the line energies are @xmath66 ev for fexxv and @xmath67 ev for fexxvi .",
    "we have checked that there are no significantly strong iron lines at the observed energies from any other ionization states ( e.g. , beiersdorfer et al 1993 ) .",
    "interestingly , the shift of the two line energies are similar to each other ( @xmath68 per cent lower than rest energies ) .",
    "if the redshift is due to the doppler effect from receding warm scattering matter , then the radial velocity is @xmath0 40005000 .",
    "the optical polarized broad h@xmath69 line is also redshifted but only by 600  ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) from the narrow line component , which is explained as scattering in outflowing wind ( krolik & begelman 1986 ; balsara & krolik 1993 ) . as the discrepancy between the velocities is too large , the same outflowing wind is perhaps not an explanation .",
    "it should be noted however that the x - ray lines are produced in the mirror itself whilst the polarized broad line is scattered by the mirror .",
    "the location of the gas emitting the two higher energy lines is an issue .",
    "it is supposed to lie outside the torus .",
    "systematic studies of seyfert 1 galaxies with asca show that a large fraction of them show evidence for partially ionized gas in the line of sight , implied by absorption edge feature mainly due to oxygen , ovii and oviii ( reynolds 1996 ) . a recent study of the warm absorber in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( otani et al 1996 ) suggests that the ovii and oviii absorbers occupy distinct regions",
    "; the variability study locates the ovii absorber @xmath70 pc far from the central source , and the oviii absorber in the broad - line region .",
    "if we observed this object from a different viewing angle , the ovii warm absorber would be seen as a scattering mirror .",
    "however , the ionization state implied from ovii ( @xmath71 a few tens erg cm s@xmath72 ) is too low for the emission of fexxv and fexxvi .",
    "if ionized gas in the nucleus of ngc1068 has a similar ionization structure to that of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , the gas emitting the highly - ionized iron line should be located well within the torus like the oviii absorber so that it would not be visible to us directly . if this is the case , the radiation emitted from the inner hot gas , including resonantly scattered fexxv and fexxvi lines , is also scattered into our line of sight by the cold reflecting matter .",
    "the line emission would be compton scattered and then end up having line energies shifted lower as observed .",
    "scattered continuum radiation would have the same shape as the cold reflection continuum .",
    "we do however know that the optical / uv mirror ( see e.g. , miller , goodrich & mathews 1991 ) is located outside the torus and is at least directly visible to us , so we should see some x - ray continuum scattered from it .",
    "( it is unlikely that this mirror is sufficiently ionized to produce the high ionization x - ray iron lines . )",
    "this may reconcile the small value of @xmath73 .",
    "importantly , the ew with respect to the warm reflection continuum , discussed before ( e.g. , table 2 , sections 2.2 and 3.1 ) , is now meaningless since the spatial orgin of the lines and continuum is not the same .",
    "uncertainties in the geometry of the inner nucleus and the mirrors make it difficult to estimate the expected luminosities from each component .",
    "a further possibility , which can increase the predicted ew of the lines from highly ionized iron , is that there is velocity shear in the warm mirror .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1 , the ew decreases as the column density of the mirror increases as the line is absorbed .",
    "this assumes that the scattering medium is all at the same velocity .",
    "if , however there is shear such that the velocity doppler - shifts the line by more than its spectral width ( natural and thermal ) over a typical mean free path , corresponding to a column of @xmath74 , then much of the line is not resonantly absorbed in other parts of the mirror .",
    "a larger ew then arises from greater optical depths than assumed in section 3.1 ( see fig .",
    "9 in matt et al 1996 for an indication of the effect ) . for a mirror gas temperature of about @xmath75 ,",
    "the velocity shear needs to exceed about @xmath76@xmath77 for this to be significant .",
    "the upper limit on the width of the line ( @xmath78  ev ; table 1 ) limits the extent of this effect . in this case",
    "the intrinsic luminosity can be less than we estimated in section 3.1 .",
    "higher resolution spectroscopy resolving the individual line shapes will test and discriminate between these hypothesis .",
    "given the complex geometry and the possible complexities in the formation of the iron and other x - ray lines , we expect it to reveal that ngc  1068 has a rich and interesting spectrum .",
    "we thank all the member of the asca pv team for maintenance and operation of the satellite and y. taniguchi for useful discussion .",
    "the data analysis are carried out using ftools and xspec provided by the guest observer facility of nasa / goddard space flight center .",
