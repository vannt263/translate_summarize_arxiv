    "the elliptic flow at midrapidity , originally called out - of - plane emission or squeeze - out , has attracted a lot of attention during the last years .",

    "its centrality dependence has been considered as an experimental proof that during the expansion of the system the almond shaped initial spatial configuration of the overlap region is transformed into an elliptic flow with a _ positive _ @xmath0 value , which is predicted by viscous hydrodynamics @xcite . at lower energies",

    "this came as a surprise because blocking of the in - plane emission by spectator matter should show only a moderate dependence on the compressibility of the nuclear eos .",

    "this translates into a stronger force into the y - direction .",
    "the density gradients and consequently the forces are stronger for a hard eos ( hm ) as compared to a soft one ( sm ) .",
    "this explains quantitatively the dependence of @xmath0 on the hadronic eos .",
    "the scattering of participant protons with the spectator matter produces an elliptic flow as well , but this component is almost independent on the eos .",
    "the agreement of the qmd calculations with data for a soft eos adds to the circumstantial evidence that the soft eos describes correctly the matter at a density obtained by beam energies of the order of 1 agev , an observation that has already been made by analysing the @xmath3 production data @xcite .",

    "<S> recently it has been discovered that the rapidity dependence of the elliptic flow , @xmath0 , of charged particles shows the strongest sensitivity to the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) which has been observed within a microscopic model . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence on the nuclear eos is predicted by quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) calculations @xcite which show as well that the absorption or rescattering of in - plane emitted particles by the spectator matter is not the main reason for the eos dependence of the elliptic flow at mid-rapidity.the reason are different density gradients ( and therefore different forces ) in the direction of the impact parameter ( x - direction ) as compared to the direction perpendicular to the reaction plan ( y - direction ) , due to the presence of the spectator matter .    </S>",
    "<S> the stronger density gradient in y - direction accelerates the particles more and creates therefore a negative @xmath0 . </S>"
