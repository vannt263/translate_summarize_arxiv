    "one of these phenomena is the quasi - elastic ( qe ) excitation which is dominated by the single particle dynamics , well described by the mf approach in terms of one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) excitations .",
    "experimentally , the qe excitation is obtained by using probes which interact weakly with the system and by controlling the kinematical conditions in such a way that only one of the particles composing the system is directly struck by the external probe .",
    "this produces a relatively small perturbation of the system which however responds as a whole because the knocked particle is linked to the other ones .",
    "the total response is related to the characteristics of the interaction among the particles .    in the electron excitation of the atomic nuclei , the region where the nuclear response is quasi - elastic",

    "the inelastic electron scattering cross section shows an evident peak at higher energies than those of the giant resonance region .",

    "these two facts lead to the interpretation of the peak as produced by the elastic scattering of the electron with a single nucleon .",
    "an ideal experiment on a free nucleon produces a narrow peak positioned exactly at @xmath2 . understanding the deviation from this situation means understanding the nuclear electron excitation mechanism and the nuclear many - body dynamics .",

    "this separation is somewhat artificial but it is useful to better determine and clarify the various approximations and uncertainties done in the study of the qe peak .    the description of the reaction mechanism is based upon the plane wave born approximation and the use of the traditional electromagnetic one - body operators , and we shall discuss the limits of all these approximations considering the distortion of the electron wave functions , the presence of meson exchange currents and the relativistic corrections to the one - body operators .",

    "these are called transverse components and they are usually expressed in spherical coordinates : @xmath40 to calculate the cross section one has to square the scattering amplitude , to average on the initial states and to sum over the final ones . since the electron energies @xmath41 are much bigger than its rest mass @xmath42 , it is common to use the so called ultrarelativistic approximation consisting in neglecting the terms depending on @xmath42 .",

    "this provides the exact solution for the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "the situation is more difficult to handle in the case of inelastic scattering since the electromagnetic field generated by the nucleus is not any more static because it is produced by a transition from the ground to the excited state . in the most sophisticated treatment developed up to now , the one - photon exchange scattering amplitude ( [ amplitude1 ] ) is calculated using the electron wave functions obtained by solving the dirac equation with a coulomb potential generated by the target nucleus ground state .",
    "this treatment is called distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) and its validity in the description of low lying states has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "there are two major effects that the dwba adds to the pwba description .",

    "the asymptotically measured initial and final momenta @xmath82 and @xmath83 are smaller than the effective momenta of the electron around the nucleus .",
    "this is an interpretation of the phenomenon based upon a pwba description of the process , since dwba wave functions are not eigenstates of the momentum operator of the electron . in this simplified picture",

    "this produces a transferred momentum larger than that of the pwba .",

    "the difference between the pwba momentum transfer and the effective one increases with the charge @xmath86 of the target nucleus and diminishes when the electron energy @xmath87 increases .",
    "the second dwba effect is of quantum mechanical nature and consists in the focusing of the electron wave function onto the nucleus causing an increase of the flux and an enhancement of the cross section .",
    "this effect is partially compensated by the reduction of the cross section due to the @xmath88 shift .    in the dwba expression of the cross section",

    "their alignment is compatible with an exact straight line ( see fig . [ dwba ] ) .",
    "for this reason the alignment of the cross sections on a rosenbluth plot can not be considered a proof of the validity of pwba .",
    "the major effect of the distortion on a rosenbluth plot consists in a rotation of the line around the intersection point with the @xmath54 axis .",

    "these considerations are valid for a fixed value of the excitation energy .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the full energy dependence of the responses has been studied .",
    "the distortion effects on @xmath1ca consists mainly of a shift to higher energies and it can be rather well described in terms of @xmath88 .",
    "the situation in @xmath89pb is more complicated since the focusing of the wave function plays an important role .",

    "different type of form factors can reproduce the elastic scattering data with the same degree of accuracy .",
    "the sensitivity of the nuclear responses to the different choices of the electromagnetic nucleon form factors has been studied in ref .",

    "this fact can be understood by considering the strength of the residual interaction and the density of nuclear final states .",
    "the residual interaction in the qe region is very weak , therefore rpa effects are small . on the other hand ,",

    "the qe excitation of nuclei is a good testing ground of our knowledge of the electron - nucleus interaction and our understanding of the nuclear excitation mechanism . since surface effects are not important @xcite it is meaningful to compare directly the experimental data with the results of complicated many - body theories developed in infinite systems @xcite .",
    "we believe that the solution of the problems mentioned above and the interest of the theoreticians in comparing the results of their models with qe data require new accurate and reliable data which could be rather straightforwardly obtained at the new electron accelerator facilities .",
