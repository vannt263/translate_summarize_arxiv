    "at energies above @xmath0  tev , about one cosmic ray particle per square meter per second reaches earth . at the highest observed energies , particles reach more than @xmath1  ev , which is far above what can be achieved in man - made accelerators . the origin of these charged cosmic rays is still being discussed , as their direction is scrambled by extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields .",
    "one option for identifying the origin of cosmic rays is the observation of secondary particles produced in cosmic ray interactions in the astrophysical plasmas themselves : if a proton @xmath2 interacts with ambient matter or photon fields @xmath3 , pionic secondaries are produced via the processes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the charged pions subsequently decay into neutrinos , @xmath6 , where we do not distinguish between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "the resulting neutrino flux usually follows the spectral behaviour of the protons , which is predicted to be close to @xmath7 according to fermi acceleration ( @xcite ) .",
    "the conventional atmospheric neutrino spectrum due to pion and kaon decay , on the other hand , shows a spectral behaviour of approximately @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an additional component of the atmospheric neutrino flux comes from the decays of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks .",
    "this flux , known as the prompt component is expected to have a spectrum close to @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux is lower than the conventional flux but could start to dominate the total spectrum at energies above about @xmath10  tev .",
    "so far , only the conventional neutrino flux is observed @xcite .",
    "measurements at high energies , i.e.  above @xmath11  tev , provide an opportunity to reveal an extraterrestrial or a charm component . at these energies , the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) and its successor icecube are able to make measurements to look for deviations from the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux .    the amanda - ii detector was designed for the detection of neutrinos above 100  gev .",
    "it is composed of 677 optical modules ( oms ) , each containing a 8-inch , 14-dynode photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and a voltage divider for the high voltage .",
    "the pmts are optically coupled to the pressure glass sphere with a silicon gel and can be operated at a high gain of about @xmath12 .",
    "the optical modules are attached to 19 vertical strings , instrumenting a cylindrical volume of @xmath13  km@xmath14 ( with a radius of 100 m and a height of 500 m ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "secondary muons in the ice are produced via the process @xmath15 .",
    "the muons produce cherenkov radiation if they travel faster than the speed of light in ice ( i.e.  if the muons travel faster than @xmath16 , with @xmath17 as the speed of light in vacuum ) .",
    "additional cherenkov radiation comes from the particles produced in muon interactions , such as bremsstrahlung , direct pair production and photonuclear interactions , all dominating at muon energies above 1 tev . at higher energies , the sum of the energy loss due to stochastic processes ( i.e.  bremsstrahlung , pair production and nuclear interaction ) is dominant and increases linearly with the energy .",
    "the amount of light detected with the optical modules rises with the muon energy and therefore also with the energy of the parent neutrino .",
    "thus the detected light amount can be used to determine the primary neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "neutrino - induced muons can be distinguished from atmospheric muons by selecting events that traverse the earth and arrive at the detector from below the horizon .",
    "atmospheric muons can not reach the detector from those directions since they are absorbed on their way through the earth . in this energy range",
    "( @xmath18  tev ) , neutrino absorption in the earth is not significant .",
    "neutrinos can traverse the matter without loss and some neutrinos interact close to the detector , so that the products of these neutrino interactions can be observed .",
    "amanda data from the years 2000 to 2003 are analyzed to determine the energy spectrum of neutrinos , presenting for the first time the atmospheric neutrino spectrum in the energy range @xmath19  tev . in section [ nus : sec ] , predictions for atmospheric neutrinos are reviewed . in section [ deconvolutionexplained ] , a conceptual overview of the issues involved in deconvolving a spectrum from observed data are discussed . in section",
    "[ analysis : sec ] , more details of the data reduction , simulation and analysis method for the deconvolution of the neutrino spectrum are explained .",
    "section [ nn : sec ] then describes a neural network used for the construction of an optimal energy - correlated variable , while section [ unfolding : sec ] shows how the atmospheric spectrum is determined by regularised unfolding , and discusses the sources of statistical and systematic uncertainties that enter the calculation .",
    "section [ results : sec ] summarises the results while section [ discussion : sec ] discusses them in the context of other experimental results and flux predictions .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions : sec ] gives the conclusions from this analysis along with an outlook on the possibilities for icecube , the successor of the amanda experiment .",
    "when cosmic rays traverse the earth s atmosphere , hadronic showers are produced by their interactions with the atmosphere . depending on the energy of the primary cosmic ray , different secondaries can be produced .",
    "up to energies of @xmath20  tev , the flux is dominated by pion and kaon decays .",
    "this flux is usually referred to as the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the expected power - law spectrum of conventional atmospheric neutrinos is typically one power steeper than the primary cosmic ray spectrum : charged pions and kaons have rest - frame lifetimes of the order of @xmath21  s. high energy pions and kaons travel far enough in the atmosphere that they may interact with atmospheric nuclei before they decay . as the lifetime increases with the particles energy , high - energy pions and kaons have a higher probability to interact before decaying , which steepens the spectrum by one power .",
    "an analytic description of the neutrino spectrum between @xmath10  gev and @xmath22  gev is given by @xcite : |__.(e_,)= a_()^- , [ volkova : equ ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are energy distribution parameters that depend on the zenith angle @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ volkova : equ ] ) covers the energy range relevant for this analysis , and will be used to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "the energy spectrum varies with the zenith angle , as a pion traveling through the atmosphere horizontally @xmath28 experiences a smaller density gradient than a pion traversing the atmosphere vertically @xmath29 .",
    "thus , nearly vertical pions have a higher probability of interacting with the atmosphere , which reduces the flux compared to the horizontal component .",
    "other predictions of conventional atmospheric neutrino fluxes are given by @xcite and @xcite , with uncertainties in the modeling of around 15% @xcite .",
    "the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux is a second component in the atmospheric neutrino spectrum and is due to the decay of charm and bottom hadrons , which contain charm quarks .",
    "since @xmath30 and @xmath31 hadrons have lifetimes shorter than @xmath32  s , they decay before any further interaction with the ambient matter can take place .",
    "thus , these hadrons produce an isotropic neutrino spectrum whose shape is close to the primary cosmic ray spectrum , i.e.  @xmath33 .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino energy spectrum has so far been measured in the range @xmath34  tev @xcite .",
    "the flux is found to follow the prediction of the conventional atmospheric flux within uncertainties . here",
    ", the atmospheric neutrino spectrum extending up to 200 tev is presented for the first time .",
    "as theoretical uncertainties increase towards higher energies , the experimental investigation of the atmospheric spectrum can lead to conclusions about particle interactions , possible charm contribution or a possible extraterrestrial component .",
    "determination of the neutrino energy spectrum in a detector like amanda is complicated by various factors .",
    "neutrino energies are not measured directly but are inferred from measuring the energies of the interaction products of the neutrinos .",
    "the three flavors of neutrinos produce different secondary patterns of particles in a detector , with correspondingly different correlations to the primary energy .",
    "an electron - neutrino will deposit most of its energy into an electromagnetic or hadronic cascade , which , limited by the resolution of the energy reconstruction algorithm , will correlate directly to the primary energy .",
    "a tau - neutrino produces two cascades of particles , one from the initial interaction and a second from the decay of the tau particle .",
    "if the energy of the event is sufficiently small , then both of these may be contained in the detector and thus be representative of the neutrino energy . for the main signature in amanda , upward moving muon tracks ,",
    "the neutrino energy can not be directly measured , because of the range of the muon . for a neutrino that interacts inside the detector",
    ", the muon may carry away a significant fraction of the neutrino energy which is then not measured . for high - energy neutrinos that interact very far away ,",
    "the energy deposited in the detector from the final muon will only correlate weakly with the neutrino energy .",
    "this further degrades the correlation to the initial energy .",
    "moreover , whatever energy algorithm is used , its limited resolution will further degrade the ability of the experiment to measure a particle spectrum .    in practise ,",
    "one uses knowledge of the neutrino physics and detector response to infer the parameters of the primary neutrino spectrum .",
    "mathematically , this inference is represented by an integral equation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the probability of observing an event with a reconstructed parameter vector @xmath37 , @xmath38 represents the detector response to initial particles of energy @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the neutrino flux and @xmath41 is the non - neutrino background . here , @xmath36 represents the distribution of some parameter related to the energy of the event , e.g.  the total deposited energy , or a direct estimate of the particle energy .",
    "once @xmath36 is obtained and @xmath38 is determined via detector calibration and simulation , then there are several ways to infer @xmath40 .",
    "the simplest is to take theoretical estimates of @xmath40 and see which one results in an expected @xmath36 that fits the data best .",
    "if the theory can be parameterised , then these parameters can be adjusted until a best fit is found and errors on the parameters can be determined .",
    "examples of this would be direct fitting of the slope @xmath3 and normalisation @xmath42 of a spectrum of the form @xmath43 .",
    "another method employed in amanda is to assume the general form of a theoretical flux from a calculation and fit for a free normalisation and deviation from the spectral shape .",
    "these methods are commonly known as _",
    "forward folding _ -",
    "the parameters of the flux are adjusted and then forward propagated through to an observable which is compared with data . in principle , the flux can be made theory independent by choosing a parametric form with a large number of parameters .",
    "this leads to a problem where small statistical fluctuations in the observed data may result in unphysical solutions for the spectrum , manifesting as bumps and dips in the spectrum .",
    "methods known as regularisation are employed , whereby constraints on the smoothness of the solution are imposed , to control these effects .",
    "for the low parameter methods , regularisation is built into the solution , for instance by the assumption of a power law spectral form .",
    "as the number of parameters grows , the computational time to solve for the best fit set of parameters also increases . as an alternative , non - iterative methods , collectively known as _ unfolding methods _ , exist for the direct solution of the high parameter problems .",
    "the difficulties of regularisation are still inherent in these direct methods , just as they are in the interative forward folding methods .",
    "these considerations aside , the conceptual basis of unfolding is to use the direct inverse of the matrix @xmath38 to solve for @xmath44 .",
    "the accuracy of a deconvolution of the spectrum using any of the methods improves on finding an observable @xmath37 ( which is possibly vector - valued ) that is well correlated to the neutrino energy , manifested by minimising the influence of the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath38 .",
    "there is an irreducible component of the off - diagonal elements set by the physics of neutrino interaction and muon propagation .",
    "for instance , the fact that the muon carries away only a fraction of the neutrino energy and then loses energy as it propagates to the detector reduces the correlation of the muon energy to the original neutrino energy .",
    "the size of the off - diagonal elements depends on how well correlated the chosen variables are with the neutrino energy . in this work ,",
    "the energies of the muons are reconstructed by using a neural network , making use of six energy sensitive variables .",
    "the output of the neural network , along with two other energy sensitive parameters , form the observable @xmath37 for the unfolding .",
    "we do not directly unfold the atmospheric neutrino spectrum but unfold an intermediate spectrum which is a convolution of the actual flux with the probability of the neutrinos having passed through the earth and with the efficiency for detection .",
    "thus , the intial unfolding returns a neutrino spectrum with the same number of events as observed in the detector .",
    "this is then corrected as a function of energy and angle back to the true atmospheric spectrum .",
    "for the determination of the neutrino energy spectrum from @xmath19  tev , 807 days effective livetime of data taken by the amanda detector between the years 2000 and 2003 are used .",
    "the selection of neutrino candidates for zenith angles @xmath45 is presented in @xcite . in a final step ,",
    "tracks with @xmath46 are removed to minimise the atmospheric muon contamination of the neutrino sample .",
    "the final sample contains 2972 neutrinos @xcite and includes a background of less than 1% misreconstructed atmospheric muons @xcite .    in order to avoid possible biases we perform a blind analysis in the following sense : the properties of the selected events",
    "are initially checked on 10% of the full data set , by comparing this reduced data set to simulations of the atmospheric muon background and the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the simulation is done by using the air shower simulation corsika for the background @xcite and the neutrino generator _",
    "nusim _ for the atmospheric contribution @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ mc_chain : fig ] .",
    "the neutrino generator takes into account the interaction of the neutrinos with the antarctic ice .",
    "then , the tracks of the neutrino - induced muons are simulated in the muon propagation monte carlo _ mmc _ @xcite .",
    "finally , the detector simulation amasim @xcite is used to simulate the emitted cherenkov light and to emulate the hardware behaviour .",
    "the same event selection applied to the experimental data set are used on the simulated data to identify the energy - sensitive variables for the analysis .",
    "the simulation data and the 10% experimental data set are compared to verify the consistency of the event selection .",
    "this is essentially the approach used in a previous amanda analysis of the same upgoing neutrino data set to obtain limits to the extraterrestrial neutrino flux @xcite .    after having",
    "optimised the analysis on the 10% subset of the data , the full data set is used to determine the energy spectrum of the detected up - going neutrino - induced events .",
    "these events are expected to pile up at energies below 2 tev . given the high estimated purity of the investigated data set in terms of neutrinos @xcite , its energy spectrum is expected to be consistent with an atmospheric spectrum . while the theoretical predictions of the shape of this spectrum only show minor deviations between 2 tev and 20 tev , at energies between 20 tev and 200 tev deviations due to the unknown contribution of prompt neutrinos - in this case a slight flattening of the spectrum - are possible .",
    "neutrinos of extraterrestrial origin are expected to significantly flatten the spectrum at even higher energies .    a schematic view of the analysis chain is shown in fig .",
    "[ mc_chain : fig ] .",
    "six energy - dependent observables are used as input variables for a neural net in order to produce a combined , optimised energy variable ( section [ nn : sec ] ) .",
    "the combined variable is taken together with one further observable plus one of the variables entering the neural net , the latter still containing a component orthogonal to the nn output . with the three partially independent variables",
    ", the neutrino energy spectrum can be determined using regularised unfolding ( section [ unfolding : sec ] ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum contains the effective number of events . as consequence of the unfolding",
    ", the probability density function of each event is distributed to several bins of the energy spectrum leading to broken event numbers in the spectrum . by relating the simulated neutrino energy spectrum to the effective number of events obtained by unfolding the simulated flux , the energy spectrum of the effective number of events of the measured data is finally normalised to obtain the absolute neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "due to the limited acceptance and finite resolution of the detector , the reconstruction of the neutrino energy spectrum can be obtained only with unfolding methods . for this analysis , the method of regularised unfolding",
    "is used according to the run algorithm by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows up to three energy dependent variables as input for the unfolding procedure .",
    "therefore , a set of three variables correlated to the neutrino energy is selected .    in a first step ,",
    "the following seven observables which show the best correlation with the generated neutrino energy in simulations , are selected from all variables well described by the simulation .",
    "* @xmath47 : the number of oms ( channels ) having detected exactly one photon as signal during the event . due to the stochastic energy losses of the muons , the number of emitted cherenkov photons and hit oms increases with the muon energy .",
    "* @xmath48 : the number of oms ( channels ) having detected one or more photons as signal , which increases with increasing muon energy . * @xmath49 : the total number of signal photo electrons within the event , which increases with increasing muon energy .",
    "each om can contribute to an event by the detection of one ore more photoelectrons counted in this variable .",
    "* @xmath50 : the average photon arrival time , i.e.  the sum of all recorded photon arrival times relative to the trigger time , divided by the total number of hit optical modules .",

    "@xmath51 : the root mean square of the arrival time distribution of the photons , which grows with the number of late photons generated i.e. in secondary energy losses .",
    "* @xmath52 : the sum of all measured charges , in units of photoelectrons , divided by the number of hit oms .",
    "this is equivalent to the mean number of recorded cherenkov photons and is correlated to the energy .",
    "* @xmath53 : the root mean square of the charge distribution of the photons in each om , which grows with the maximal number of photons from secondary energy losses .    some of these variables are correlated and their number exceeds the maximum of three allowed as input for run . as a consequence of a multitude of tests , in a second step , the first six variables are combined through a neural network ( nn ) to give one energy dependent variable .",
    "the nn output is then used together with @xmath54 and @xmath55 as the three inputs to the run algorithm .",
    "the neural network is a standard back - propagation multi - layer perceptron ( mlp ) with two hidden layers used in a 6 - 6 - 3 - 1 feed - forward architecture ( fig .",
    "[ nn : fig ] ) .",
    "the complete simulation chain is used to generate a training set of muon events , with energies uniformly distributed in equidistant logarithmic energy bins between 500 gev and 5 pev and with trajectories uniformly distributed throughout a cylindrical volume with 400 m radius around the detector center .",
    "the nn is trained and tested with muon data sets , each containing 100,000 events .",
    "the simulated events are then reconstructed and processed in the same way as the experimental data .",
    "the energy resolution of the nn output is estimated with four test sets of mono - energetic muons , generated in the same way as the training set and with muon energies of 1 tev , 10 tev , 100 tev , and 1 pev .",

    "the agreement in slope depends on the neutrino energy spectrum chosen for the simulation .",
    "the apparently somewhat steeper decrease of the nn output predicted for a simulation according to @xcite will be consistently visible also in the comparison of the final unfolding result ( fig .",
    "[ conventional : fig ] ) with different flux predictions .",
    "following the notation introduced in section [ deconvolutionexplained ] , we form the energy sensitive variable @xmath37 as the vector combination of the neutral network output , the logarithm of the number of channels fired and the logarithm of @xmath53 .",
    "the probability distribution of this vector variable is @xmath36 , leading to the need to solve for @xmath40 in the equation @xmath59 .    by binning the generated energy distribution and the recorded parameter",
    ", this integral equation can be transformed to a linear matrix equation @xmath60 the vectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the histograms containing the distribution of the observable , the sought - after energy spectrum and the distribution of the background .",
    "the kernel * a * contains the design matrix , describing the statistical detector properties .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the kernel arise from the finite resolution of the energy estimators . solving this equation by inversion leads to an ill posed problem because the transfer matrix * a * necessarily contains off diagonal elements much smaller than unity , which in turn prevents the calculation of an _ a priori _ stable solution . to stabilise the solution , proper assumptions about the curvature of the solution have to be introduced to cut off insignificant elements of the matrix * a*. + in the run algorithm @xcite , the probability distributions used to unfold spectra on the basis of given observed parameters are parametrised in the form of a superposition of cubic b - splines of fourth order .",
    "the possible curvature of the solution is controlled by the number of degrees of freedom and the number of knots of the spline - superposition .",
    "if the number of degrees of freedom is too small it would damp significant amplitudes and smooth the solution too strongly ; too many degrees of freedom could enforce unphysical wiggles in the solution .",
    "the number of knots of the spline is of only little influence on the result if chosen much higher than the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure is called regularisation and implemented in the unfolding algorithm run .    for the given experimental situation , the problem simplifies to the determination of an approximately linearly decreasing function if , instead of determining @xmath40 from @xmath37 , @xmath64 is calculated from @xmath65 . to obtain an optimal parameter combination , extensive simulation tests of the following form",

    "a possible flattening of the spectrum is visible in all tested cases .",
    "the unfolding result is restricted to be positive and the run internal histogram used to calculate the acceptance correction is smoothed .    using these settings ,",
    "different simulated spectra were unfolded . in total , the unfolding quality is checked with 278,000 monte carlo data sets . each of them contains the unbiased statistical equivalent of one year of amanda data , a combination of atmospheric neutrinos and added signal contributions with an @xmath68 spectrum . for signal contributions proportional to @xmath68 ranging up to an contribution of @xmath69 , 1,000 independent unbiased monte carlo data sets ,",
    "each containing one year of amanda data are produced .",
    "these monte carlo sets were checked to see if a flattening of the neutrino energy spectrum towards high energies would be observed if such a signal were present . also , the statistical errors obtained with the algorithm for the given binning follow a gaussian ( or for small effective number of events , a poissonian ) distribution . the chosen unfolding parameters would smooth out spikes on top of the spectrum smaller than the bin width in the middle and lower side of the investigated energy range .",
    "an essential part of the unfolding procedure is the proper estimation and accounting of the uncertainties , statistical and systematic , that propagate through the unfolding to determine the error bars on the spectrum . in run the statistical error",
    "is calculated under the assumption that poissonian and gaussian statistics can be applied .",
    "the same analysis shows that the distribution of the unfolding results for every bin follows a gaussian .",
    "it further shows that towards high energies a flattening of the spectrum is visible with the chosen method if an extra signal component is present .",
    "+ in addition to the statistical errors , there are several sources of systematic uncertainty that affect the estimation of the unfolding matrix and thus propagate through the unfolding to the error bars on the physical atmospheric neutrino spectrum .",
    "estimates of the uncertainties due to the response of the detector are quantified in @xcite .",
    "here , we discuss additional sources of uncertainty from the neutrino cross sections and muon propagation , which both influence the rate and angular distribution of the detected events .    the neutrino - nucleon dis cross - section has been measured directly at accelerators up to only @xmath70 gev @xcite . at much higher energies ,",

    "although the total cross section can be calculated with high precision , the spectral averaged energy parameter @xmath80 , in the sense used here closely connected to the cherenkov light produced by the stochastic energy losses , can only be estimated to a precision of a few percent .",
    "the probability of detecting emitted cherenkov light depends on both on light propagation through the ice and the effective efficiency @xmath82 of the optical modules .",
    "comparing the slopes of depth intensity relation of atmospheric muons in monte carlo and data allows us to set an upper limit on the averaged systematic uncertainties .",
    "in addition to the factors relevant for the muon detection , this deviation also contains effects due to the model dependent muon production in the atmosphere . for this analysis ,",

    "this uncertainty in slope transfers directly to the neutrino flux calculation . combining all the independent detector systematics from @xcite of ( 8% ) with the cross section ( 10% ) and the muon propagation uncertainties ( 10% ) gives a total uncertainty in flux of 16% which is applied to the statistical error bars from the unfolding .",
