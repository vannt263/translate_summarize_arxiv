    "this article is devoted to providing part of the foundation needed for a partial morse theory for parametrized minimal surfaces in riemannian manifolds which should parallel the well - known morse theory of smooth closed geodesics in a compact riemannian manifold @xmath2 .",
    "recall that the theory of closed geodesics is concerned with the action integral @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes a riemannian metric on @xmath2 and @xmath5 is the usual coordinate on @xmath6 , which is regarded as the unit interval @xmath7 $ ] with endpoints identified .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 denotes the hilbert manifold of @xmath9-maps of @xmath6 into @xmath2 , maps which are @xmath10 and have @xmath10 first derivatives , as described for example in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath11 is invariant under a continuous right action of the circle group @xmath6 on @xmath8 , @xmath12 and therefore whenever any point is critical for @xmath11 , so is the entire @xmath6-orbit .",
    "thus nonconstant critical points for @xmath11 are never morse nondegenerate in the usual sense .",
    "however , the bumpy metric theorem of abraham @xcite states that for generic choice of riemannian metric , all nonconstant smooth closed geodesics lie on nondegenerate critical submanifolds of dimension one , and have the property that their only jacobi fields are those generated by the @xmath6-action .    the purpose of this article is to provide a similar bumpy metric theorem for the energy function on maps from compact closed riemann surfaces into a compact riemannian manifold @xmath2 of dimension at least four .",
    "thus suppose that @xmath1 is a compact riemann surface without boundary of genus @xmath13 , that @xmath14 is a completion of the space of smooth maps from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with respect to a suitable sobolev norm , and that @xmath15 is the teichmller space of marked conformal structures on @xmath1 .",
    "then the _ energy _",
    "@xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 dx dy = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_\\sigma |df|^2 da,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are local conformal coordinates for the conformal structure @xmath19 ( the integrand being independent of the choice ) and @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the norm of @xmath22 and the area element with respect to any metric on @xmath1 within the conformal structure @xmath23 . for a fixed choice of @xmath19 , we define @xmath24 critical points for @xmath25 are called harmonic maps ( or @xmath23-harmonic maps when we want to emphasize the specific conformal structure ) , while critical points for @xmath26 are ( weakly ) conformal harmonic maps , or equivalently minimal surfaces , possibly containing branch points . in osserman",
    "s survey @xcite , in which the ambient manifold @xmath2 is euclidean space , critical points of @xmath26 are called _ generalized _ minimal surfaces when branch points are allowed , but we will use the simpler term parametrized minimal surfaces for such objects .    in some cases one can prove existence of critical points for these functions by means of a perturbed energy introduced by sacks and uhlenbeck @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus for @xmath19 and @xmath27 , we define a function @xmath28 by @xmath29 where the riemannian metric on @xmath1 used in the integrand is chosen to be a metric within the conformal equivalence class defined by @xmath23 .",
    "although the ability to choose a metric on @xmath1 provides potential flexibility , we will normalize the metric on @xmath1 to be the unique constant curvature metric of total area one .",
    "we call @xmath30 the _ @xmath31-energy_. we recall some important properties of the function @xmath32 when @xmath33 is the completion with respect to the sobolev @xmath34-norm , where @xmath35 : the function @xmath30 has continuous derivatives up to order two , it satisfies condition c of palais and smale and its critical points are as smooth as the metric on @xmath2 . for fixed choice of @xmath27 , one can use techniques of global analysis @xcite to prove existence of critical points for @xmath30 corresponding to minimax constraints . as @xmath36 , one can often show that a minimax sequence `` will approach a harmonic map in the limit , together with a finite number of bubbles , '' which are harmonic maps of two - spheres .",
    "there are several difficulties in constructing a morse theory for the energy function @xmath26 via this approach .",
    "first , bubbling interferes with the most straightforward version of the morse inequalities ( but also suggests a procedure for analyzing to what extent the morse inequalities fail ) .",
    "second , minimax sequences for various constraints might tend to the boundary of teichmller space , a phenomenon already observed in the plateau problem for mappings of riemann surfaces with boundary into euclidean space @xmath37thus a minimizing sequence might have a handle pinch off in the limit , for example .",
    "third , a given minimal surface has infinitely many different markings , giving rise to an orbit of critical points in @xmath38 under an action of the mapping class group @xmath39 .",
    "( we describe this action at the beginning of  [ s : diffeogroup ] . )",
    "this action leaves the energy invariant , so the energy actually descends to a function on the quotient @xmath40 where the domain projects to the moduli space @xmath41 with typical fiber @xmath42 .",
    "one really wants a partial morse theory to estimate the number of critical points of given index in the quotient , and although the base space @xmath43 is diffeomorphic to a ball when @xmath44 , it is only an orbifold for large genus .    finally , just as in the theory of smooth closed geodesics , multiple covers of a given minimal surface should not count as geometrically distinct , even though they will appear as distinct critical points for @xmath26 . indeed , this difficulty is more pronounced for maps from surfaces because the covers might be branched : suppose , for example , that @xmath45 is a smooth harmonic map and that @xmath46 is a nontrivial conformal branched cover .",
    "( if @xmath47 , the riemann sphere , we can regard @xmath13 as a meromorphic function on @xmath48 . )",
    "then the composition @xmath49 is called a _ branched cover _ of the harmonic map @xmath45 .",
    "any compact simply connected riemannian manifold must contain minimal two - spheres @xcite , so branched covers are often present .    in spite of these difficulties , it is sometimes possible to control bubbling and use critical point theory for the @xmath50-energy to prove existence of harmonic maps or minimal surfaces .",
    "one application is the theorem of sacks and uhlenbeck @xcite that any compact simply connected riemannian manifold contains at least one minimal two - sphere .",
    "another application involving equivariant morse theory for minimal two - spheres is presented in @xcite , in which we use bounds on the energy to prevent bubbling , which yields existence of many minimal two - spheres of low energy in suitably pinched @xmath51-spheres , which satisfy appropriate hypotheses . for further results of this nature ,",
    "we need a bumpy metric theorem for parametrized minimal surfaces as a foundation .    in view of transversality techniques of smale @xcite and uhlenbeck @xcite",
    ", it is not surprising that such a bumpy metric theorem should hold when properly formulated .",
    "indeed , white proves a bumpy metric theorem for imbedded minimal submanifolds of arbitrary dimension in a riemannian ambient manifold @xcite .",
    "however , for the theory of parametrized minimal surfaces , it is crucial that we allow for the possibility of branch points .",
    "branch points always occur on the nontrivial branched covers of parametrized surfaces of lower genus mentioned before ; such branched covers can have arbitrarily large spaces of jacobi fields that can not be removed by generic perturbations of the metric on @xmath2 .",
    "removing branch points by perturbation on the remaining surfaces is the key issue which needs to be resolved for establishing a bumpy metric theorem in the parametrized context which is strong enough for our projected applications .",
    "( a related transversality theorem for gromov s theory of pseudoholomorphic curves is presented in the book of mcduff and salamon @xcite . )",
    "another complication to the parametrized theory is that when the genus of @xmath1 is small , the energy function @xmath26 is invariant under a nontrivial connected lie group @xmath52 of symmetries . in the case where @xmath1 is the torus , the two - dimensional lie group @xmath53 acts on @xmath14 preserving the energy , which implies that nonconstant minimal tori lie on orbits of critical points of dimension two . in the case where @xmath1 is the riemann sphere @xmath54",
    ", the energy is invariant under the action of the six - dimensional lie group @xmath55 via linear fractional transformations on the domain .",
    "this action preserves the energy and hence nonconstant minimal two - spheres lie on orbits of critical points having dimension six .",
    "since @xmath56 is noncompact , it is often convenient ( in accordance with the procedure used in @xcite ) to replace @xmath57 by the subspace of maps with center of mass zero , \" @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the standard inclusion onto the unit sphere in @xmath37 .",
    "this allows us to reduce the symmetry group of the energy function from @xmath56 to its maximal compact subgroup @xmath60 .",
    "( this is particularly useful for the approach to existence via @xmath50-energy , because the @xmath50-energy is only invariant under the smaller group @xmath60 . ) because of the group actions , the most one could hope for in the cases of minimal spheres and tori ( as well as nonorientable projective planes and klein bottles ) is that in analogy with the closed geodesic problem , the critical points for energy lie on nondegenerate critical submanifolds for generic choice of metric on the ambient manifold .",
    "let us recall bott s definition :    .1 in * definition .",
    "* let @xmath61 be a @xmath62 function on a smooth manifold @xmath43 .",
    "a _ nondegenerate critical submanifold _ of @xmath43 is a finite - dimensional submanifold @xmath63 such that every @xmath64 is a critical point for @xmath65 and @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the hessian of @xmath65 at the critical point , and elements @xmath68 which satisfy the condition on the right - hand side of ( [ e : noncritsub ] ) are called _",

    "_ generic choice of riemannian metric _ , we mean a metric belonging to a countable intersection of open dense subsets of the spaces of @xmath72 riemannian metrics on @xmath2 , where @xmath73 ranges over the positive integers .",
    ".1 in with these definitions in place , we can now state our main theorem for critical points of the energy function @xmath26 :    .1 in * main theorem .",
    "*    _ suppose that @xmath2 is a compact connected smooth manifold of dimension at least four . then _    1 .   for a generic choice of riemannian metric on @xmath2 ,",
    "every prime minimal two - sphere @xmath74 is free of branch points and lies on a nondegenerate critical submanifold of dimension six which is an orbit for the g - action , where @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   for a generic choice of riemannian metric on @xmath2 ,",
    "every prime minimal two - torus @xmath75 is free of branch points and lies on a nondegenerate critical submanifold of dimension two which is an orbit for the g - action , where @xmath53 .",
    "3 .   for a generic choice of riemannian metric on @xmath2 ,",
    "every prime oriented minimal surface @xmath69 of genus at least two is free of branch points and is morse nondegenerate in the usual sense .    moreover , in each of the cases , the prime minimal immersions @xmath76 have transversal crossings .",
    ".1 in in particular , if @xmath2 has a generic metric , prime oriented closed parametrized minimal surfaces within @xmath2 are immersions . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on oriented minimal surfaces throughout most of the article , although the argument can be modified to give a bumpy metric theorem for nonorientable minimal surfaces by arguments we sketch in  [ s : nonorientable ] .",
    "the freedom from branch points asserted in the main theorem provides an analog of a well - known theorem of bhme and tromba ( @xcite and @xcite ) that parametrized minimal surfaces bounded by a generic smooth closed jordan curve in @xmath77 have no branch points when @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , the main theorem shows that the nondegeneracy hypothesis of theorems 1 and 2 of @xcite hold for generic metrics .",
    "here is a brief outline of the remainder of the article .",
    "we first review the parametric theory of closed harmonic and minimal surfaces in riemannian manifolds in  [ s : prelim ] , and explain the relationship with the theory of riemann surfaces . in ",
    "[ s : harmonic ] we prove a bumpy metric theorem for @xmath23-harmonic immersions via a proof schema which will be used as a model for the proof of the main theorem .  [ s : two - variableenergy ] , we describe second variation for a two - variable energy in which the metric on the range is allowed to vary .",
    "although this reduces to the usual second variation formula for minimal surfaces when restricted to normal variations , the more general formula uncovers additional tangential jacobi fields when applied to minimal surfaces with branch points .",
    "the number of such jacobi fields is calculated by means of the riemann - roch theorem . we then establish the expected the easy bumpy metric theorem for immersed minimal surfaces .    the key idea behind",
    "the main theorem is that some of the tangential jacobi fields generated by the branch points can be perturbed away by suitable perturbations in the metric .",
    "the reason one expects such perturbations is described at the beginning of  [ s : eliminatesimple ] , and we then go on to construct explicit tangential variations that would perturb away all tangential jacobi fields not generated by the action of @xmath52 for minimal surfaces with only simple branch points and with self - intersection set consisting only of double points .",
    "this gives a bumpy metric theorem for simple branch points as we describe in  [ s : simple ] .",
    "to proceed further , we need to examine the self - intersection set of arbitrary minimal immersion in  [ s : selfintersection ] , modifying slightly well - known results on self - intersections of minimal surfaces in three - dimensional manifolds .",
    "these extend the easier fact that prime parametrized minimal surfaces are automatically somewhere injective , which follows from a theorem of aronszajn .",
    "abraham s original sketch for the bumpy metric theorem for geodesics @xcite relied on a transversal density theorem presented in @xcite .",
    "we use that theorem in  [ s : genericselfintersection ] to prove that for generic metric on @xmath2 , any parametrized minimal surface @xmath76 is an immersion with transversal crossing on the complement of its branch locus . but to establish the hypotheses of the transversality theory , we need that prime minimal surfaces lie on countably many submanifolds parametrized by metrics in ",
    "[ s : submanifoldsoftildem ] .",
    "a modification of this argument then finished the proof of the main theorem in ",
    "[ s : proof ] . even though we do not know how to perturb away all the tangential jacobi fields ,",
    "the perturbations we can construct allow us to show that for any branch type with nontrivial branch locus , the minimal surfaces of this branch type lie in a countable sequence of manifolds which project to the space of metrics via a fredholm map with fredholm index @xmath79 .",
    "the main theorem then follows from the sard - smale theorem .",
    "in  [ s : nonorientable ] we describe how the argument for the main  theorem can be modified to treat prime nonorientable minimal surfaces , while a brief final section (  [ s : families ] ) describes how the main theorem can be extended to generic one - parameter families of metrics on @xmath2 .    throughout this article",
    ", we will assume some familiarity with the techniques of global analysis on infinite - dimensional manifolds , presented in @xcite and with more details in @xcite .",
    "more leisurely introductions are found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the core theorems to keep in mind is nicely stated in a survey article by eells @xcite ( see page  780 ) : if @xmath80 and @xmath2 are finite - dimensional smooth manifolds and @xmath81 denotes the completion of the space of smooth maps from @xmath80 to @xmath2 with the @xmath82 norm , a smooth infinite - dimensional manifold , then @xmath83 is a @xmath84 map . in conjunction with the sobolev lemmas",
    ", this can be extended to yield smoothness of composition in sobolev completions , and specializes to yield various versions of the so - called @xmath50- and @xmath23-lemmas of @xcite .",
    "one version of the @xmath23-lemma for @xmath85 spaces states that if @xmath1 is a smooth surface and @xmath86 and @xmath87 are smooth manifolds of arbitrary dimension , a @xmath88 map @xmath89 induces a @xmath88 map @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the completion of @xmath92 maps with respect to the @xmath85 norm , for any @xmath93 and @xmath73 satisfying @xmath94 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take @xmath80 to be a one - point space , ( [ e : lossofderivatives ] ) only shows that the evaluation map @xmath95 is @xmath84 .",
    "the loss of derivatives implicit in ( [ e : lossofderivatives ] ) often forces us to work in a sobolev completion @xmath96 in which the number @xmath73 of generalized derivatives is high .",
    "for example , in arguments involving branch points , the needed value of @xmath73 is sometimes determined by the largest possible branching order , which in turn depends on an upper bound @xmath97 for the energy , as we will see in the next section .",
    "this is harmless for projected applications , since regularity theorems imply that critical points for @xmath26 and @xmath98 are always @xmath88 .",
    "it would be an easy exercise to rephrase the argument in terms of frchet manifolds as described in @xcite .",
    "the author thanks vincent borrelli of the universit claude bernard of lyon , france for helpful discussions on the theory presented here during a visit to lyon in december of 2004 .",
    "he also thanks the referee for numerous questions and suggestions that helped him make many major improvements to the article .",
    "we recall a few basic concepts from the theory of harmonic and minimal surfaces in riemannian manifolds ( some of which are presented in more detail in @xcite ) .",
    "we focus first on the @xmath23-energy @xmath25 for a fixed choice of riemannian metric @xmath99 on @xmath2 .",
    "the first derivative of @xmath25 is given by the formula @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the euler - lagrange equation for the variational problem .",
    "if @xmath102 is a critical point for @xmath25 , we can differentiate once again to obtain the hessian , @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the derivative with respect to the variable @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the jacobi operator , a formally self - adjoint second - order elliptic differential operator which acts on sections of the pullback @xmath107 of the tangent bundle to @xmath2 .",
    "such sections are the elements of the tangent space to @xmath14 at @xmath102 .",
    "elements @xmath108 of this tangent space @xmath109 which satisfy the _",
    "jacobi equation _",
    "@xmath110 are called _ jacobi fields _ at @xmath102 .",
    "note that since @xmath111 , the jacobi equation is just the linearization of the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "in terms of a local complex coordinate @xmath112 on @xmath1 , with @xmath113 denoting the conformal factor ( so that the area element is given by @xmath114 ) , the euler - lagrange equation for an @xmath23-harmonic map @xmath76 is simply @xmath115 is regarded as a section of the complex bundle @xmath116 over @xmath1 , and @xmath117 denotes the pullback of the levi - civita connection of @xmath2 to @xmath118 .",
    "thus the euler - lagrange equation just says that the section @xmath119 is holomorphic , when @xmath118 is given the holomorphic structure ( guaranteed to exist by a theorem of koszul and malgrange ) such that if @xmath120 is an element of @xmath121 , the space of smooth sections of @xmath118 , then @xmath122 although the locally defined holomorphic section @xmath123 : \\sigma \\rightarrow { \\mathbb p}({\\bf e})\\ ] ] is independent of choice of local coordinate @xmath124 and is a globally defined section on @xmath1 , where @xmath125 denotes the bundle of complex projective lines in fibers of @xmath118 .",
    "this globally defined family of lines defines a holomorphic line bundle @xmath126 within @xmath118 .",
    "a point @xmath127 is said to be a _ branch point _ if @xmath128 . in this case , if @xmath124 is a holomorphic coordinate centered at @xmath93 , we can write @xmath129 where @xmath13 is a holomorphic section of @xmath118 such that @xmath130 . the integer @xmath131 is called the _ branching order _ of @xmath102 at @xmath93 .",
    "observe that the vector - valued differential @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the holomorphic cotangent bundle of @xmath1 , also known as the canonical bundle , and this section has zeros precisely at the branch points of @xmath102 .",

    "we let @xmath136 denote the branching order of the harmonic map @xmath102 at @xmath93 and call the finite sum @xmath137 the _ divisor _ of the harmonic map @xmath102 . by standard arguments in riemann surface theory (",
    "as presented in @xcite ,  7 ) , we can determine the isomorphism class of the holomorphic bundle @xmath126 , the result being that @xmath138 where @xmath139 are the branch points of @xmath102 and @xmath140 is the holomorphic point bundle at @xmath93 .",

    "the argument for the main theorem can now be extended so that it applies to nonorientable surfaces . in the proof , we need a teichmller space for the punctured nonorientable surface @xmath1308 each branch point @xmath619 lifts to two branch points @xmath1309 and @xmath1310 in the oriented double cover which are interchanged by @xmath1245 . if @xmath1 has genus at least two , the cotangent space to the teichmller space for @xmath71 consists of the meromorphic quadratic differentials @xmath1284 on the oriented double cover with at most simple poles at the branch points @xmath1309 and @xmath1310 such that @xmath1311 in the case where @xmath733 , we excise one additional pair of points from @xmath251 which are interchanged by @xmath1245 , while if @xmath250 , we excise three pairs of points interchanged by @xmath1245 .",

    "once these changes are made , it is relatively easy to check that the previous arguments yield a version of the main theorem for nonorientable minimal surfaces . for generic choice of metric , prime minimal projective planes and klein bottles are free of branch points and lie on nondegenerate critical submanifolds with dimensions dictated by the group actions . for generic choice of metric , prime nonorientable minimal surfaces whose orientable double covers",

    ".    we can now give a rough description of the full collection of parametrized minimal spheres and tori in a riemannian manifold with generic metric .",
    "for minimal two - spheres , we first have the constant maps which make up a nondegenerate critical submanifold at energy level zero",
    ". then we have the prime minimal two - spheres themselves .",
    "next we have the branched covers of minimal two - spheres , which can be thought of as more complicated parametrizations of the prime minimal two - spheres .",

    ", we have the constant maps and the prime minimal tori once again .",
    "this time , however , there are two types of covers , ordinary covers of prime minimal tori and klein bottles without branch points , and branched covers of prime minimal two - spheres and projective planes .",
    "when the genus is at least two , a complete critical point theory for minimal surfaces of genus @xmath13 would have to consider prime surfaces of genus @xmath13 , branched covers of prime minimal surfaces of genus @xmath1312 and branched covers of prime nonorientable surfaces .",
    "the argument we presented actually establishes an important extension of the main theorem . recall that for each branch type @xmath967 we have a subspace @xmath964 of @xmath963 consisting of prime parametrized minimal surfaces of branch type @xmath967 , where @xmath51 is the number of branch points in @xmath1313 , and we have a natural projection @xmath1314 but propositions 7.3.2 and 7.4.1 show that for @xmath13 belonging to a subspace of @xmath387 of codimension @xmath535",
