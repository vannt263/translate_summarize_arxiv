    "experimental measurements have shown that heavy quarks suppression at relatively high-@xmath10is as large as that of light quarks  @xcite , which was inconsistent with earlier theoretical expectation of the flavor dependence of parton energy loss .",

    "is the ideal candidate  @xcite , as @xmath1-@xmath2 correlations inherit most of charm pair correlations .",
    "however , due to the relatively small charm cross section , small hadronic decay branching ratio which is used to reconstruct @xmath1 meson and limited signal to background ratio , the direct measurement of @xmath1-@xmath2 correlations would be very challenging .",
