    "to date , over 30 pulsating subdwarf b ( ec  14026 or sdbv ) stars have been identified , with pulsation periods ranging from 68 to 528 seconds and with amplitudes generally less than 50 millimagnitudes ( mmag ) . for recent reviews of this class of stars , see kilkenny ( 2001 ) , and reed , kawaler & kleinman ( 2000 ) , for observational properties ; charpinet , fontaine & brassard ( 2001 and references therein ) describe in detail some important aspects of pulsation theory in sdb stars .",
    "most sdbv stars show periods at the short end of the range , and probably represent stars close to the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) .",
    "pg  1605 + 072 is the longest period , and lowest gravity , sdbv star , with feige  48 being an intermediate object . in general , the longer - period sdbv stars represent more highly evolved objects .",
    "feige  48 was identified as a `` faint blue star '' as part of the feige survey ( feige , 1958 ) .",
    "it was re - categorized as an sdb star when it was observed as part of the palomar - green survey ( green , schmidt , & liebert , 1984 ) .",
    "koen et al . ( 1998 ; hereafter k98 ) identified five pulsation periods in feige  48 in six observing runs from 1997 may to 1998 february .",
    "the periods detected by k98 range from 342 to 379 seconds with the largest amplitude being 6.4 mmag .",
    "amplitude variability led k98 to conclude that mode beating was probably present implying that other unresolved modes were present in their data .",
    "this provided the motivation for our follow - up observations .",
    "heber , reid , & werner ( 2000 ; hereafter hrw ) obtained a high resolution ( 0.09 ) spectrum of feige  48 , from which they determined log @xmath1=5.50@xmath20.05 and t@xmath3=29500@xmath2300 k. this places feige  48 among the coolest sdbv stars known with a surface gravity intermediate between pg  1605 + 072 and the rest of the class .    here",
    "we report on our multi - year campaign of high - speed photometry of feige  48 . in section  2 , we outline our observations .",
    "section  3 describes the time series analysis and period identifications .",
    "we report on a stellar model fit to feige  48 in section  4 .",
    "the phase stability of pulsations is described in section  5 , where we use this stability to place interesting limits on any possible planetary companion .",
    "section 6 gives our conclusions and outlines future observations for feige  48 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,<,<,^ , > , < \" , ]      a test of our ( or any ) model is the measured constraint on rotational velocity .",
    "the observed average rotational splitting of 27.7@xmath4hz imposed on our @xmath5 model identification implies a rotation period of 0.42 days ( 10 hours ) . with a radius of 0.20  r@xmath6",
    ", this model has an equatorial rotation velocity of 24  km s@xmath7 . to match the constraints of hrw ( @xmath8 ) requires @xmath9 .",
    "if we use the less restrictive value determined by hrw for only the unblended spectral lines in feige  48 of @xmath10 , our inclination limit increases to @xmath11 .",
    "the identification of an @xmath0 triplet and a radial mode suggest an observation that can be used to test the model . as in white dwarfs",
    "( kepler et al . 2000 ) , time series spectroscopy ( particularly in the ultraviolet ) should present an effective means of discerning between low and high order ( @xmath12 ) nonradial pulsations . though it is still in its infancy for sdbv stars ( otoole et al .",
    "2002 ; woolf et al .",
    "2002 ) , _ if _ the 378s period is @xmath12=3 , it should be obvious in uv spectroscopy ( perhaps less so in the optical ) where it should have a significantly higher amplitude than at optical wavelengths .",
    "the same is true for our identification of the @xmath12=1 triplet .",
    "if any member of our identified triplet really has a different @xmath12 value , the wavelength dependence of its amplitude will be different .",
    "such a test should be obtained as an independent confirmation of our @xmath5 determination .",
    "while this test can be applied to any sdbv star , feige  48 has comparatively long pulsation periods ( exceeded only by pg  1605 + 072 ) and its rather simple temporal spectrum ( only 5 periods compared to 55 for pg  1605 + 072 ) make it an ideal candidate for time series spectroscopic study .",
    "as a star evolves , the pulsation properties evolve in response . in the case of the subdwarf b stars ,",
    "evolutionary models indicate that they reside on or near the zahb for approximately @xmath13 years . upon exhausting their core helium supply ,",
    "they leave the hb , their @xmath14 goes down , and pulsation periods lengthen . the time scale for evolutionary pulsation period changes ( p / p ) after leaving the hb is about 10 times faster than while on the hb .",
    "if feige  48 has a comparatively small log @xmath1 because it is a mature hb star that has left the zahb , we expect feige  48 to have an evolutionary p smaller than pg  1605 + 072 , yet larger than for shorter period pulsators .",
    "since pg  1605 + 072 does not appear to have pulsations stable enough for an analysis of secular period change caused by evolution ( reed 2001 ) , feige  48 is the best candidate to examine the @xmath15-folding time for structural changes caused by its core evolution . as a guide",
    ", the model described in section 4 has a p=@xmath16  syr@xmath7 . with @xmath173 years of usable data ,",
    "the phase of a 350s period should change by @xmath1714 seconds in that time .",
    "this is close to our limit of detection .    to examine long - term phase change , we followed methods outlined in winget et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and costa & kepler ( 2000 ) .",
    "first , we obtain a best - fitting least squares fit to all of the periodicities present over the entire span of the observations ( table  [ tab04 ] ) .",
    "we then fix the frequencies at these best - fitting values , and recompute the pulsation phases ( again via least squares ) for each group in table  [ tab02 ] ( note that groups iii and v were divided into two subgroups each because of the long length of the runs ) .",
    "this computed phase represents the observed time of maximum ( @xmath18 ) for that group , which differs from the computed time ( @xmath19 ) from the fit to all data . the resulting @xmath20 diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig04 ] for the three highest amplitude modes ( with the pulsation period indicated in each panel ) .",
    "the phase zero point is that defined in k98 as jd=2450571.50 .",
    "[ fig04 ] shows that the phases are stable throughout most of our observations . until the group x data were collected , we believed the group i data suffered a timing error ( proposed in k98 ) .",
    "however , it now seems apparent the pulsation modes were only stable over a limited timespan ( from group ii through ix ) . as a check",
    ", we analyzed various subgroups of group x data and reproduced the same phase result .",
    "such a problem is observed in other sdbv stars over a much shorter timescale ( reed 2001 ) .",
    "though we are disappointed in the apparent lack of phase stability , we still have an approximately three year span of phase - stable observations .",
    "we therefore used the phase - stable data to place upper limits on the magnitude of p / p .",
    "the combined @xmath20 data of the three highest amplitude modes were weighted and fitted using least squares and give p / p=@xmath21 .",
    "the data are therefore consistent with zero period change and provide a @xmath22 lower limit on an evolutionary timescale of @xmath23 years .",
    "of course evolution is not the only thing that can drive period changes ( see for example papar et al .",
    "however , evolutionary models predict that sdbv periods should change in a predictable way ( increasing just off the zahb , then decreasing after core helium exhaustion , and finally increasing again during shell helium fusion ) . by measuring p for several sdbv stars at different stages",
    ", we should be able to determine if evolution ( as predicted ) is driving the period changes .",
    "with the phase - stable portion of the data , we can also place useful limits on companions to feige  48 .",
    "orbital reflex motion would create a periodic shift in the pulsation s arrival time , which would be observed in pulsation phase .",
    "thus any companion must create a periodic phase change within our @xmath20 uncertainties over a scale of days to years . to place limits on companions , we calculated companion mass as a function of binary period and semimajor axis by fitting sine curves ( for circular orbits ) within our 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath24 @xmath20 limits .",
    "to assure an upper limit ( m@xmath25 ) on reflex motion , we use the `` noise '' in the ft of our @xmath20 as a 1@xmath24 lower limit : this results in a minimum phase shift of 5 seconds for binary periods under 20 days and 4 seconds for longer periods .",
    "[ planet ] graphically presents our sensitivity to orbital companions .",
    "the top line represents the 3@xmath24 limit for @xmath26 ( our model constraint ) . in the short period case ( periods under 30 days ) ,",
    "the constraint is the limit imposed by the phase errors of individual runs within the data ; in the long period case it is the flatness of the @xmath27 diagram ( including the errors of combined runs ) over the phase stable region of our observations .",
    "the drop at 30 days corresponds to the change from @xmath20 values determined for single runs to group data sets .",
    "feige  48 is a horizontal branch star that has lost considerable mass between the red giant branch and its current evolutionary state .",
    "any companion separated by more than @xmath171 au is far enough away that common  envelope evolution ( or vaporisation ) has been avoided .",
    "in addition , the orbital separation will have roughly doubled as feige  48 lost approximately half its mass during the red giant phase .",
    "this should produce two cases for binaries : close stellar companions with original separations @xmath28au will produce a short period binary ( which have periods on order of weeks or less ) after a common envelope phase .",
    "companions distant enough to avoid a common envelope phase ( or vaporisation ) will have orbital periods on the order of a year or more .",
    "the two panels of fig .  [ planet ] reflect this duality ( though it does cover all periods between 2 days and 5 years ) .    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ planet ] indicates our limits on stellar companions .",
    "our 1@xmath24 limit is less than 0.1m@xmath29 for a binary period of 3 days .",
    "the right panel shows our limits on sub  stellar companions .",
    "our `` average '' 3@xmath24 limit for @xmath26 is @xmath30m@xmath31 , while our best 1@xmath24 limit would detect jupiter at a period of 2.5 years .",
    "our data are currently sensitive to the extra solar `` warm jupiter '' type planets being detected at a distance of 0.6 - 3.0 au",
    ". planets with orbital separations less than @xmath171 au would not have survived the red giant phase .",
    "our data do not rule out a companion in an extremely short period binary or at low inclination .",
    "from our multi - season photometry of feige  48 , we have consistently detected five pulsation periods .",
    "of these five , three ( @xmath321 , @xmath323 and @xmath324 ) are consistent with k98 .",
    "one frequency ( @xmath325 ) differs by a daily alias , while k98 s fifth frequency ( 2874  @xmath4hz ) is not detected in our data . in data sets v and ix , we also detect new pulsation frequencies at 2890 and 2843  @xmath4hz respectively , indicating that there may be some stochastically excited pulsations in feige  48 .",
    "this is consistent with pulsation behavior seen in another sdbv star , pg  1605 + 072 ( reed 2001 ) .",
    "our attempted model fit follows the strategy that has been successfully applied to other classes of pulsating stars , but has rarely worked for sdbv stars ; namely using observed frequency splittings to impose @xmath12 constraints on models . using standard evolutionary models ,",
    "our preliminary model grid includes a model that is able to explain all but the lowest frequency stable pulsations .",
    "most exciting is the fact that such standard models fail to explain all five frequencies .",
    "thus , despite its relative simplicity and the richness of the parameters available , the failure of this model suggests that standard stellar evolution theory does not fully explain the evolution of sdb stars and or the nature of pulsations within them .",
    "we have something new to learn .",
    "our modeling example shows that feige  48 should also serve as an interesting test for other methods of mode identification . though optical multicolour photometry was not useful for identifying pulsation modes in kpd2109 + 4401(koen 1998 ) , we expect that uv multicolour photometry as developed by robinson , et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , will be useful to determine _ if _ high  order @xmath12 modes are present in sdbv stars ( as indicated by brassard et al .",
    "2001 and billres et al .",
    "the argument for high ",
    "order @xmath12 values is particularly interesting in light of the frequencies detected in group v s data .",
    "if the lowest frequency mode is disregarded , the remaining modes have frequency spacings of 13.3 , 26.4 , 12.8 , and 16.3  @xmath4hz respectively .",
    "if these were all parts of a single , rotationally split mode , it would require @xmath33 .",
    "such an @xmath12 value should be apparent in uv multicolour photometry ( see , for example , kepler et al 2000 ) .",
    "as such , we look forward to the analysis of hst data obtained by heber ( 2002 )",
    ". should heber s ( 2002 ) hst data agree with our @xmath12=1 interpretation , feige  48 would make an excellent star to calibrate other mode identification methods in sdbv stars such as optical time - series spectroscopy ( otoole et al 2002 ; woolf et al 2002 ) .",
    "the results of our @xmath20 analysis are consistent with a non - binary nature for the star within the data limits",
    ". it also indicates that using the @xmath20 diagram to detect planets around evolved stars is possible , though in this case we did not detect any .",
    "we plan to continue to monitor feige  48 over the next several years to tighten the constraints on planetary companions .    our limit on a stellar companion also addresses the origin of sdb stars .",
    "binary evolution is a candidate for producing sdb stars , either through common - envelope evolution ( sandquist , taam & burkert 2000 ; green , liebert & saffer 2000 ) or via roche - lobe overflow near the tip of the red giant branch ( green , liebert & saffer 2000 ) .",
    "though observations indicate that a great many sdb stars _ are _ in binaries ( reed & steining 2003 ; green , liebert & saffer 2000 ; han et al 2002 ) , either the evolutionary sequence that produces sdb stars is independent of binary evolution ( dcruz et al 1996 ) , is bimodal , or has several paths that can result in the production of an sdb star ( perhaps including the merger of two low mass white dwarfs as described by iben & tutukov 1986 ) . for the case of feige  48",
    ", it would appear that it is either in a short period binary ( whose orbital period is commensurate with the @xmath1710 hour rotation period predicted with our model ) , in a long period binary with an orbital period substantially longer than our data ( which would rule out roche - lobe overflow , so the companion would have no effect on the evolution of the pre - sdb star ) , in a binary with an extremely low inclination or a single star .",
