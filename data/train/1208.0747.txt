    "the variety of chemical reactions in a living organism are carried out by enzymes .",
    "it appears that the rate of chemical reactions ( both forward and backward ) are accelerated by enzymes .",
    "they are essential because many chemical reactions occur without the activity of enzymes .",
    "such reactions are linked with an enzyme s active site , and they become a product after a series of stages . these stages are known as the enzymatic mechanism .",
    "there are two types of mechanisms , single substrate and multiple substrate mechanisms @xcite .",
    "an important branch of enzymology is enzyme kinetics which is used to study the rate of chemical reactions .",
    "differential equations are used to characterize the enzyme kinetics based on some principles of chemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "the single enzyme reaction is one of the most powerful kinds of kinetic reaction .",
    "simply put , this enzyme reaction is defined as follows : @xmath0 where the concentrations of enzyme , substrate , enzyme - substrate complex and product are defined by @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the reaction rate constants . by using the idea of mass action",
    ", we can describe the reaction equation ( [ equ : eq1 ] ) in terms of a system of non - linear ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "there are varieties of possible simplifications for system ( [ equ : eq1 ] ) to describe analytic approximate solutions of the system .",
    "one of the most common approaches to simplifying this system is the use of quasi - steady state approximation ( qssa ) .",
    "the quasi - steady state assumptions occur as fundamental assumptions for enzyme kinetics , and the history of this subject began 80 years ago .",
    "it plays a key role with regard to the analysis of the enzyme kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "another simplification is the michaelis - menten equation created in 1913 which pointed out that the enzyme reaction ( [ equ : eq1 ] ) should be @xmath7 , therefore @xmath8[s]}{[es ] } = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}$ ] .",
    "it means that there is an equilibrium between @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] to produce @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] . in 1925 ,",
    "briggs and haldane proposed that the michaelis - menten assumption is not always applied .",

    "this is known as the steady state assumption ( ssa ) or is sometimes called the quasi - steady state approximation ( qssa ) , or pseduo - steady sate approximation @xcite .    the first description of qss was given by briggs and haldane in 1925 @xcite .",
    "they described the simplest enzyme reaction in equation ( [ equ : eq1 ] ) , and pointed out the total concentration of enzyme @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath1_{tot } = [ e]+[es]$ ] is a tiny value in comparison with the concentration of substrate @xmath2 $ ] .",

    "the purpose of this work is to derive asymptotic approximate expressions for the substrate , product , enzyme and enzyme - substrate concentrations for equation ( [ equ : eq6 ] ) by using ( hpm ) and ( sim ) , and to point out the similarities and differences between the methods of ( hpm ) and ( sim ) for all values of dimensionless reaction diffusion parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "another aim of this project is to find out the appropriate iteration in ( sim ) compared to ( hpm ) .",
    "the michaelis - meten equation ( [ equ : eq1 ] ) was applied by kuhn in 1924 @xcite to several cases of enzyme kinetics .",
    "the model of biochemical reaction was developed by briggs and haldane in 1925 @xcite .",
    "the model of an enzyme action considers a reaction that includes a substrate @xmath2 $ ] which binds an enzyme @xmath1 $ ] reversibly to a substrate - enzyme @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the substrate- enzyme leads reversibly to product @xmath4 $ ] and enzyme @xmath1 $ ] .",

    "this can be represented in dimensionless form as follows : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 in this paper , we estimate the analytic approximate solution for a system of non - linear ode equations ( [ equ : eq18])-([equ : eq21 ] ) , by using the methods of ( hpm ) and ( sim ) .",
    "the basic idea of the homotopy - perturbation method ( hpm ) is defined in this section .",

    "the function @xmath45 consists of linear part @xmath50 and non - linear part @xmath51 .",

    "first of all , the second iteration has many significant similarities compared to ( hpm ) , and some of them provide excellent results in terms of our work . for instance , figures [ fig : fig2a]-[fig : fig2e ] show that the value of the concentration of substrate @xmath141 slightly decreases from its initial value @xmath143 , and there are a few changes in the value of the concentration of the enzyme - substrate complex @xmath142 .",
    "generally , they reach some constant values after @xmath144 . also , in figures [ fig : fig4a]-[fig : fig4e ] it appears that the concentration of the components are somewhat similar to those of corresponding figures [ fig : fig2a]-[fig : fig2e ] .",

    "also , in the same interval of time , the value of the concentration @xmath142 reaches a maximum in figure [ fig : fig4c ] as well .",
    "we can also realize that the value of the enzyme in both figures ends up at a minimum value when @xmath145 .",
    "in addition , figures [ fig : fig3a]-[fig : fig3e ] and figures [ fig : fig4a]-[fig : fig4e ] show that there is a gradual decrease in the rate of substrate @xmath141 between @xmath145 which then levels off after @xmath144 . on the other hand",
    ", the concentration of the product @xmath74 slightly increases between @xmath145 in both set of figurs , and is likely to remain stable after @xmath144 .",
